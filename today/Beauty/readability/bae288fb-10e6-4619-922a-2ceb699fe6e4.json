  "description": "I've been a fan of IT Cosmetics for as long as I can remember. I first fell in love with the brand after trying its beloved CC+ Cream, which remains one of my favorites to this day. This pattern has become familiar over the years: each time I test any of its latest releases, I find myself consistently impressed. Among the standout products that followed the CC+ Cream is the Superhero Mascara ($28). As a beauty editor constantly sampling the latest offerings to stay up to date with the best products of the year, I've tried too many mascaras to count. To this day, to this day Superhero continues to be one of my tried-and-true favorites. What makes it so good? Ahead, I break down everything you need to know about it before adding it to your cart. Keep reading for my full review. About the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara first launched in 2016, and the waterproof version followed in 2023. It's formulated and designed to lengthen and add volume to your lashes. It's infused with collagen, biotin, proteins, and peptides to condition lashes while enhancing their appearance. What I Love About the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara What I love about the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara is how well it enhances the volume and length of my super-straight lashes without clumping them together. Before applying any mascara, I use my Tweezerman eyelash curler. Without it, I've noticed that mascara tends to weigh down my lashes, counteracting my goal to add volume. In the below photo, you'll see my left eye in its natural state (without having used an eyelash curler) and the right eye prepped without mascara, just freshly curled. (The difference is jarring, I know.) How to Use the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara Applying IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara is straightforward. I start by curling my lashes, then use the mascara wand to sweep and wiggle the product from root to tip. Two coats usually do the trick, and I'm good for the entire day. This mascara is my go-to for no-makeup-makeup looks, ideal when I want natural makeup but lashes that really pop. For days when I have an afternoon workout planned, I opt for the waterproof version ($28), which effortlessly withstands sweat and - when my CorePower Sculpt classes really take a toll - tears. Below is a photo of how my lashes look after freshly applying the Superhero Mascara. It's night and day from the lifeless lashes I started with. (And yes, they really stay like that until it's time to whip out the makeup remover.) What to Consider Before Trying the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara It's important to be aware that some users of IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara have reported clumping, as noted in the reviews. My tip is to remember that less is more with this product, as the formula is quite thick. I recommend prepping your lashes for application by combing them and removing any excess product from the mascara wand before use. If you see a glob of mascara on the wand, gently wipe it off on a tissue to ensure a smoother application. Although these additional steps might seem inconvenient, it's worth noting that not all users, including myself, have dealt with clumping. Another thing worth noting? The IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara also comes in a travel-size version ($17), if you're interested in giving it a test run before investing in the full-size tube. Who Is the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara Best For? IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara is best for those like me who want to level up their lashes with volume and length. It's a great option for all ages, given that it's infused with collagen, biotin, and peptides that condition your lashes as you coat them. While choosing a mascara is highly subjective, in my opinion, this one is worth experimenting with at least once. It might be a game-changer for you, as it was for me. Where Is the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara Available? IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara is available direct-to-consumer via the brand's website, Sephora, Ulta Beauty, and on Amazon.
