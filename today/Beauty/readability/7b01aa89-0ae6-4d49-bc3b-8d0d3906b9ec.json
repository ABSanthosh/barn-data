  "text": "When the overfarming of sandalwood—an ingredient commonly used in home and body fragrances—makes it difficult to come by, what does a scent company do? If you’re Pura, you put in the work to create a relationship with the Western Australian Martu tribe, says Lindsey Kneuven, head of impact and grants at the company.On April 23, 2025, during the Hearst Eco-Conscious Living Summit, Kneuven told our beauty director, Kathleen Hou, about Pura’s journey with the Martu to grow sandalwood, explaining that the brand has worked with the tribe for three and a half years to bring something to market, as well as to help them sustain themselves (there are currently only about a thousand Martu tribe members). That includes their practices of cultivating sandalwood—and teaching future generations to do the same. “The Martu see sandalwood as a healing ingredient that can give people power,” said Kneuven. Getty Images for Hearst MagazineBuilding the partnership with the tribe also required Pura to slow down and “camp under the stars with them,” she told the audience. “We produce on Martu time. To impose standards and timelines on their practices is kind of tone-deaf.”Watch all the discussions from the Hearst Eco-Conscious Living Summit HERE.",
