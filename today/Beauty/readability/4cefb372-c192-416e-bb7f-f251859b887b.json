  "description": "Image Source: Getty / CBS Photo Archive/ Mellow de La Loza Two years ago, Rachel Sun was finishing college, ready to put her new political science and international relations degrees to use, but she needed new nails for her graduation ceremony. \"I wanted some sort of 3D design, but there was nobody in my area who did nails like that,\" she says. \"So I thought, OK, I'll do one set for myself, and that's it.\" From there, friends saw what she was creating and began requesting their own manis. Sun started posting a few of them to her Instagram page, not thinking this would ever turn into a full-time gig. And then, Doechii called. It seems like true artistry recognized true artistry, but calling Doechii a true artist feels like an understatement - maybe visionary is more appropriate. There's a viral meme circling around the internet of the singer-rapper-songwriter-dancer extraordinaire announcing she got fired and that she was going to pop into recording studios to see if they had internship opportunities, noting that she had \"nothing to lose.\" Just five years later, Doechii accepted the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album for her first full-length, titled \"Alligator Bites Never Heal.\" Talk about manifestation at its finest. Doechii isn't likely to slow down anytime soon, and it seems as though she's taking her creative team with her. From world tours to Paris Fashion Week, magazine covers, and awards shows, Sun has been making Doechii's nails. To learn more about how Sun gets her inspiration and the designs Doechii is into now, keep reading. Doechii's Favorite Trends and Nail Polish Shades Image Source: Getty Images/ Katie Flores/Billboard and Courtesy of Rachel Sun Doechii is moving away from the original \"swamp girl\" aesthetic that defined her \"Alligator Bites\" album. \"She definitely had a slight style change since I met her in the beginning,\" says Sun. \"We wanted to really lean into nails that were reflective of her album, so I made some nails for her that [were like] crocodile claws. And at that time, she was really into more vintage colors, and now even though the color palette stays about the same, we've definitely leaned more into gold colors.\" The Inspiration Behind the Famous Button Set View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rachel (@allhailthynail) Image Source: David Jaelin For her Frost Fest performance in California during Coachella weekend, Doechii rocked spinning button nails that matched her fastener-adorned ensemble by a small designer called Handsome Girly. \"Doechii's team sent me a photo of this button outfit, and they were telling me, 'This is popping off on Twitter, we want you to make a set that kind of reflects this',\" says Sun. \"I wanted it to be a little more interesting than just gluing a bunch of buttons on the nails, and I thought, OK, buttons are round, that would be cool if they could spin - especially because she's performing, she's moving with her hands.\" To create the spinning effect, Sun glued a spinning mechanism to the nails and a button on top of that. \"I wouldn't say they're the most practical to have on someone's hand if you were living with them every single day, but for something like a performance, I thought it'd be awesome to add them on.\" The Craziest Nail Request She Ever Got Considering she's worked with actual salmon fish scales, among other wacky materials, we were curious if there has ever been a request that Sun had to say no to. It turns out, even she has her limits. \"There was somebody a while back who wanted me to encapsulate mosquitoes into his nails,\" says Sun. \"'I was wondering, are you bringing them to me? Am I finding them myself? Are they dead already or do I have to kill them first?'\" she says. \"I was like, 'I'm not down for that one.'\" 2025 Nail Trend Predictions View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rachel (@allhailthynail) It's hard to find an artist out there who's quite as innovative as Doechii, and her nail artist definitely follows suit. Sun is predicting some major new nail trends for 2025. First up, something that's all over Sun's page: asymmetrical nails, where each nail is a different shape and length. It began with \"me not being able to wear full-length nails when I'm working,\" says Sun. \"There are some nail techs out there that have super long nails and still can do perfect nail art, but I'm not one of them. I said, I'm going to do two of my nails short and leave three long.\" Sun says clients saw her nails and started requesting the same style for their various jobs. The functionality, plus the visual aspect, make them one of Sun's most requested styles. Doechii even rocked nails of all different lengths by Sun for her Tiny Desk Concert. \"I definitely think the queer community started this,\" she says, referring to \"lesbian nails,\" which have a similar look. Another trend she expects to take off is a new shape she's calling \"cube\" nails. Think: a cube sliced right down the middle, width-wise. \"They're shaped in a rectangular prism, so it's square nail tips, but they're raised into a cube shape,\" Sun says. \"You can encapsulate things inside of them, but it's still flat on top. Cube nails are the same thickness throughout.\" You can spot Sun's cube nail designs in Doechii's music video for the song \"Anxiety.\" How Doechii and Other Celebrities Keep Their Nails Healthy This was one of our most burning questions, since we can't even get a gel manicure without it weakening our nail beds. \"I was introduced to these gel sticker tabs a while back, and I think those are really nice because they don't ruin your nails at all,\" says Sun. \"If we do anything too crazy or need to do nail changes, we'll use the glue stickers.\" That way, the nail extension gets glued to the gel sticker instead of the client's natural nail.
