  "description": "Image Source: Getty/Kate Green Sometimes, you discover a makeup artist you instantly know has that it-factor. It's something you can't quite put your finger on, but as soon as you see their work on the red carpet or a magazine cover, you recognize their creative, brilliant mind. For us, that's makeup artist Kali Kennedy. If you're obsessed with the looks rocked by Charli XCX, Alexa Demie, Devon Lee Carlson, or Barbie Ferreira, you're admiring Kennedy's handiwork. The celebrity makeup artist has the maximalist, dark aesthetic pretty much down to a science: \"I feel like my work is soft with a bit of an edge,\" Kennedy says. \"I like to keep my range wide, but maintaining my essence is on my mind every time I'm working.\" Since Charli XCX transformed the entire world's summer from regular into brat, you've probably witnessed Kennedy's incredible moody looks on your TikTok and Instagram feeds. We chatted with the talented makeup artist to learn more about creating Charli XCX's Sweat tour looks, her sky-rocketing career, and the products she (and Charli XCX) can't live without. Kali Kennedy's Start in the Makeup World Growing up in a part of Southern California where creative careers \"weren't heavily encouraged,\" Kennedy credits a family member who encouraged her abilities. \"I had a grandmother who was an artist,\" she says. \"She taught me sculpting and painting at a younger age. I always knew I wanted to do something creative that involved people and socializing, but I didn't have the privilege of attending an art school or any prestigious college.\" It didn't take her long to discover her artistic outlet at a beloved makeup counter. \"I entered the makeup world through the MAC counter, as many of us did. I met Ke$ha's hair stylist shortly after, and he showed me the ropes in the freelance creative world. I truly ran with it.\" How Charli XCX and Kali Kennedy Met Charli XCX and Kennedy created defining looks this year, but as it turns out, their collaboration is long-running. \"Charli and I go way back, like 10 years,\" Kennedy says. \"We worked on something random when we were both new in the creative world. I loved her energy then, and I love her energy now. She's always been a cool girl with a zero-f*cks attitude. When brat was being conceptualized, her stylist asked for me a few times, Charli and I started talking more, and the rest was history.\" The brat aesthetic became iconic, with everyone rocking brat-inspired beauty and fashion looks wherever you turned. \"Charli loves a sexy, smoldering, almost raunchy, worn-in type of beat,\" says Kennedy. \"She is truly a quintessential hot girl.\" And we haven't seen all of Kennedy and Charli's collective genius yet: \"We also did a secret project that's not out yet while we were up in Canada,\" she says. Beauty Secrets From the Sweat Tour Kennedy has worked with the hit singer on a few tour dates this year. \"It was my first time doing something like that, and it was so fun. Charli, Troye, and Shy are the most iconic lineup ever. The word Sweat was no joke - the inspiration behind the looks was that once they sweat off [the makeup], they would still hold up, almost looking sexier. Lots of lip stains and waterproof eyeliner.\" Kennedy reveals that it didn't actually take her long to prep Charli XCX before the show. \"It would usually take me an hour or so to glam her. Matt Benns did the hair, and we would give each other a bit of still time for an intricate graphic line happening on my end or an intricate part line on his end. It's a delicate dance, but he was such a gem to work with.\" Kennedy's skin-care prep for Charli XCX (and anyone traveling daily) is lymphatic drainage with microcurrent. She utilizes the Pure Lift Pro Plus (professional only) to combat swelling and bloating, but the brand also offers the Pure Lift Pro ($699) for personal use. \"I also love the Barbara Sturm Eye Patches ($125), and Charli XCX can't live without her Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask ($24) - there are dozens around at all times,\" she says. And to keep her fresh while she performs on stage for the Brat tour, Charli XCX uses the Dove Whole Body Deodorant ($12) - a brand she partnered with in 2025. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Charli (@charli_xcx) The Creative Process Beyond Charli XCX, Kennedy has worked with many trend-setting clients. \"It simply boils down to two T's: trust and taste,\" Kennedy says about her methods. \"I truly feel blessed - what an amazing group of girlies who are genuinely just good people. The creative process with all of them usually starts with a text message asking what I think about an idea - tapping into each other's creative realm and speaking that language is most important. We all have a similar taste and energy.\" Her Beauty Picks, Trend Forecast, and Advice As a bona-fide beauty expert and makeup artist to some of the biggest stars, Kennedy knows the best brands and fantastic formulas like the back of her hands. \"I recommend the Victoria Beckham Satin Kajal Eyeliners ($34) in any color,\" she says. Despite access to nearly every beauty product on Earth, Kennedy doesn't shy away from staples. Her metal German pencil sharpener - \"I think it's $5\" - is a favorite, as well as a not-so-secret blockbuster of a product: \"I'm so basic for saying this: the Make Up For Ever Artist Color Pencil in Endless Cacao ($24) is casually one of the most coveted colors created in the past 10 years.\" For the upcoming holiday season, Kennedy predicts a few trends will take over: \"Loads of frost or glitter placed in odd places like the undereye (or the inner corners of the eye, to play it safe). Also, vampy lips - either super matte or super glossy,\" she says. But there's one trend she believes is so not brat: heavily powered bases. \"I stopped wearing powder almost completely. It's too dry in the winter to have a totally baked face or undereye. I know that may be a controversial statement.\" If you're inspired by Kennedy and want to be a makeup artist - or any artist, for that matter - she implores you to never give up. \"If you make a mistake, learn from it, but don't let it discourage you. Of course, all of this is easier said than done,\" she says. \"Actually, maybe the best word of advice is to find a great therapist.\" Nikita Charuza is a freelance writer who has been covering beauty, style, and wellness for over a decade.
