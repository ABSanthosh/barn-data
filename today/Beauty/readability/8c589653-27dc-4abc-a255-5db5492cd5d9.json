  "text": "Last weekend New York won big—historically big—when The New York Liberty clinched the WNBA championship title against the Minnesota Lynx. It marked the Liberty's first ever championship win, and ended a decades-long basketball top-spot drought for the city overall. New York celebrated with a massive parade on Thursday, and the Liberty’s power forward, Breanna Stewart, had the best seat in town (aside from Ellie, maybe). Below, she recalls her experience of the parade with ITG. If you thought this day wouldn’t include multiple Pumas, mimosas, and a four-step lip look, what were you thinking? Dear ITG, I’ve been feeling amazing—almost euphoric—since the New York Liberty won our first ever WNBA championship. It’s hard to compare, but the Seattle Storm had already won twice before when I won a championship with them, so to be a part of the team that brought New York its first basketball championship in 51 years is insane. Everybody wanted it so badly—and that’s why I came to New York, to help bring this franchise something it had never had. It’s been everything I could have imagined. The win, the parade, the celebration, everything has been wild. Honestly, we’ve partied every day since we won on Sunday—no sleep over here. Then the day before we celebrated with a parade, we rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange and went on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. I had an appearance with Puma, too. We finished out the day at Pergola and a club after, and I didn’t get to bed until 3AM. I woke up at 6AM to get my hair and makeup done for the parade. Antoinette Hill did my hair. I wanted it to be a little bit wavy so I could have it down. I did a middle part, which I don’t normally do but I think I like now. And Tenelle Veira did my makeup. We didn’t do anything crazy—the goal was to look well-rested—but I did have big lashes. She prepped my skin with Glossier's Priming Moisturizer and then used their foundation in Light 1 and Very Light 4 all over my face, using these magnetic brushes. Blush was a combination of Rare Beauty’s Soft Pinch in Hope and Glossier’s Cloud Paint in Beam and Puff. She set it all with powder from Laura Mercier and put on a coat of mascara from Ami Colé. For my brows, Tenelle filled them in and gave them shape with Boy Brow Arch in Cool Dark Brown and Boy Brow in Clear. She used a bunch of stuff on my lips: Saie’s lip liner in Wink, a mix of Glossier’s Ultralip in Villa and Beam, and Ami Colé’s lip gloss in Reflection. Versace’s Bright Crystal was my scent for the day. Oh, and I always use Dove’s deodorant and body wash. The parade was so much fun. I wore these Prada sunglasses the whole time and a custom Puma bomber jacket and Speedcats. Pants were Rick Owens. We had a mimosa brunch beforehand, and then my family—my wife, my kids, my grandparents, and my aunt—were on the float with me. I was so happy to have them there because I wanted them to see how special this moment was. It literally felt like a movie. Fans were lined up block to block and they had all sorts of merch, even vintage stuff. I was able to get off the float and high five people. There were construction workers there, and I got to sign their hard hats. I’m glad I got to do that because I wanted our fans to feel how much I appreciate them. I wanted to play all of the New York songs on the float. Jay-Z and Alicia Keys were on the playlist, but I mixed in a bit of Meek Mill because I love him. There was lots of drinking, smoking, high fives, screaming, chanting, and trying to interact with as many people as I could. At one point, we were even throwing candy to the crowd. We kept the celebration going at Barclays Center that night. It was like a club. The stadium was packed and there was no basketball being played! People would die for that attendance. Fat Joe and Remy Ma performed. My glam managed to hold up the whole day, even after a post-parade shower, but I did change up my outfit for the evening. I wore an all-black look from RTA—with my championship hat—almost fitting for a concert. We wanted this championship so badly as a team, but we also wanted it for our fans. New York just keeps showing up for us no matter what borough we’re in, no matter what time it is. This city is unlike any other—and we brought it home.
