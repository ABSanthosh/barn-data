  "description": "What do red light, microcurrent, peels, microneedling, and laser-hair removal all have in common? To start, they're all treatments you can get under the care of a professional, but they're also available to you in the comfort of your home with the right beauty gadget. We love the convenience of being able to improve our skin with the click of a button while sitting on the couch, but that's not to say that at-home beauty treatments are foolproof. This is top of mind right now because on Jan. 17, TikTok user Amina of @ItsMeMien posted a now-viral video claiming that a popular, celebrity-endorsed skin-care device caused her to experience Bell's palsy, a temporary weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. In the video, she said she only used the device twice on its lowest level before immediately noticing an issue. The device in question is the Medicube Age-R Booster Pro, which has a plethora of different features, including microcurrent, LED, and electromagnetic stimulation. People in the comments were understandably alarmed, but it may not be time to ditch your tool just yet. The brand has released a statement refuting the claims, providing an in-depth response confirming that the Booster Pro does not cause Bell's palsy. Additionally, we spoke to experts who believe it's highly unlikely to be related. (FWIW, one of our PS editors has also used the device herself on multiple occasions without issue.) To get to the bottom of this event, we chatted with three doctors who shared more about Bell's palsy, why it's not necessary to ditch your beauty tools, and the importance of following instructions when using devices at home. Experts Featured in This Article Konstantin Vasyukevich, MD, is a double board-certified facial plastic surgeon located in New York City. Kellie Reed, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist at Westlake Dermatology in Austin, Texas. Kunal Malik, MD, is a board-certified general and cosmetic dermatologist located in New York. What Is Bell's Palsy, and Can Microcurrent Cause It? \"Bell's palsy occurs when the facial nerve, which controls these muscles, becomes inflamed or compressed,\" says Konstantin Vasyukevich, MD, double board-certified facial plastic surgeon. \"While it is often suspected to be linked to viral infections, the condition is classified as idiopathic facial paralysis, meaning its exact cause is unknown.\" One of the features of the Medicube Age-R Booster Pro device is microcurrent, which is not unique to this specific device - there are plenty of other microcurrent devices on the market right now. \"Since the exact cause of Bell's palsy is unknown, we can't definitively say that skin-care devices or treatments cause nerve damage,\" Dr. Vasyukevich says. \"However, it is highly unlikely that anything over-the-counter would cause this condition.\" The (Rare) Risks That Can Come With Beauty Tools That said, you can use this event as a wake-up call to educate yourself on how to properly use your beauty devices. As great (and safe) as most of this tech is, it's still important that you know what you're doing. With microcurrent, \"risks of improper handling or using a damaged device can lead to minor electric shock or worsening of skin conditions such as various inflammatory conditions of the skin like acne or rosacea,\" board-certified dermatologist Kellie Reed, MD, says. \"It is important to know that it can interfere with some medical devices such as pacemakers or metal implants.\" Additionally, board-certified dermatologist Kunal Malik notes that using microcurrent devices without conductive gel can cause skin irritation and compromise treatment effectiveness. However, most of these concerns can be avoided by following proper instructions as listed by the manufacturer. Microcurrent isn't the only type of at-home beauty tech that you should be careful with. Widely beloved LED therapy, which is touted for its ability to fight signs of aging and banish acne, also requires a level of care. \"With LED light therapy, improper use such as excessive treatment duration or incorrect distance from the skin can potentially lead to hyperpigmentation or even burns,\" Dr. Malik says. \"I've seen patients' melasma or hyperpigmentation worsen from overusing red light therapy.\" At-home microneedling is another example of a treatment that requires some caution. Because the needles create micro-tears in the skin, it's imperative to ensure your tool is properly sterilized and that you don't puncture the skin too deep. \"At-home microneedling has the potential for complications including infections, scarring, and hyperpigmentation,\" Dr. Malik says. This doesn't make any of these treatments any less great or mean that you should forgo them all together - you just need to ensure you're following the instructions provided with the tool. How to Safely Use Beauty Tools at Home In addition to familiarizing yourself with a tool before you start using it, the experts have some additional tips to share. Make sure you follow the instructions included with your device, and consult with your physician or dermatologist if you plan on using more than one at the same time. \"Additionally, I recommend my patients start with the lowest setting or shortest treatment time recommended, then gradually increase based on their skin's response,\" Dr. Malik says. \"Consistency with proper use will always give better results than aggressive overuse.\" One other thing to note? Make sure you're cleaning any devices that touch your skin regularly. \"I feel that maintenance and proper cleaning of devices is often overlooked,\" Dr. Malik says. \"Even the safest device can become harmful if not properly sanitized between uses.\" The bottom line? Do your research. At-home beauty tools can be a convenient and safe way to amp up your skin-care routine, but as Dr. Reed puts it, \"It is essential to always read the instructions and use the devices properly to minimize potential side effects, unwanted results, or damage to the skin.\" Renee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.
