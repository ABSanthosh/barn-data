  "text": "I have a Sephora haul with a look at some new launches along with some repurchases I made recently. I shared a mini haul on Instagram Stories a week ago and a number of you asked for a blog review with swatches so I have them rounded up today! You can watch the quick haul and try-on here if you still want to see the items in action! New Spring Lip Launches I hauled quite a few of the new lip launches and there are so many I haven’t had a chance to try all of them yet. If you want a more detailed review on any of these let me know in the comments! Makeup by Mario launched a new Hydrating SuperShine Lip Gloss ($26 each). These are sheer glosses with a thick texture. I have mixed feelings about these. I think the tones he created are stunning but the pigment is very sheer and texture is on the thick side with a sticky feel. I don’t mind the formula, but the colors pull so sheer on me and I would have really loved to see more color payoff. I picked up Sunlit, Watermelon, Rose Crush, Rosewater, Perfect Pink with the brightest one Watermelon being my favorite color. They have a strong vanilla scent I find pleasant. Dior reformulated their Addict Lip Glow Balm ($40) yet again and while I find all the reformulations a little confusing, I have to say the newest version is really good. A few past options have been a little waxy feeling but this 2025 version applies smoother and is noticeably more hydrating on me. I picked up a few shades in Candy, Mahogany, Soft Nude and Rosewood. So far I’ve only had a chance to play with Candy which is a shimmery pink and has a subtle color shifting effect for a warm pink on my lips. These have the same minty feeling with a slight cooling sensation. below left to right: Candy, Rosewood, Soft Nude and Mahogany Dior launched several new shades of the Addict Lip Maximizer Gloss ($40) in their spring Glowmania collection. I shared a demo of the new shades here and I think every shade is beautiful. (One of the shades Nudemania appears to be exclusive to Dior.com but the rest are at Sephora.) New Huda Launches Huda launched a mini collection of lilac pink items and I picked up two of them. I love the idea of lilac pink makeup but find I can rarely wear the colors. This collection has changed that for me! The Faux Filler Lip Gloss ($21) in UUU Baby is one of the best sheer pinks I’ve ever tried and I am in love with the Huda Blush Filter ($23) in Ube Cream. I tried the liquid blush in store over the summer and thought they would be too dewy but I have to say I’m really loving the pink one and might check out more. It blends out so nicely and easily. It does look dewy on the skin but so far it’s been staying put very well. You can see them in action here. I added swatch comparisons to her other pink glosses which I really love (they’re smooth and truly non-sticky). Complexion / Face I never really knew how to make the Saie Glowy Super Gel Illuminators ($16 to $28) work for me until a few of you told me you mix it in with your foundation and I’m in love with the result. This dry season I’ve been wanting my bases to be a little more glowy and a little more sheered out and these gels from Saie do just the trick. They launched a new shade in Warmglow which is a champagne gold. I restocked the mini in Roseglow which is a lovely pink shimmer. I wish they made a medium in-between size because I find the regular size too large while the minis get used up too fast. If your foundation has been looking or feeling a little dry but you don’t want to switch up your skincare, I recommend adding 1-2 pumps of this into your liquid foundation. New Hair Pick + Some Repurchases I picked up the mini of the K18 AirWash Dry Shampoo ($24 for the mini) at the checkout area as an impulse buy and I really like it. It’s different from most dry shampoos I’ve tried. The formula seems more liquid/fluid when you spray it on the hair (ie it’s not really an aerosol). I love that it’s clear and doesn’t have any white cast on my hair. Does a great job at absorbing excess oil on Day 2 hair. It kept my hair looking refreshed throughout the day. I don’t know how long it lasts past 24 hours because I’m still the type of person who has to wash her hair almost daily (I’ll go 2 days max without washing my hair). Overall really love this. I restocked a few things including the Pat McGrath Skin Fetish Foundation ($69) in LM14, Benefit Precisely My Brow ($27) in Shade 2.5, Anastasia Brow Definer ($26) in Caramel and the Tarte Tartelette Tubing Mascara XL ($27). The Glossier Lip Line Longwear Lip Pencil ($18) is the best new lip liner formula I tried in 2024 and I repurchased Grip which is a my-lips-but-better rose. The formula has really good color payoff and I love the tones. New Blushes + Highlighter + Contour Blushes seem to have taken over the spring launches right now. I picked up a few of the YSL Make Me Blush Powder Blushes ($45 each) and shared a demo here. These have two finishes right now: matte and shimmer. I prefer the shimmer ones but they’re all very good. The formula is soft and pigmented but they are really easy to blend and build. Pigment is easy to control so if you just want a hint of blush you can get a more diffused look. Natasha Denona also launched her Hy-Blush Cloudy Cream Cheek Duo ($42 each) which has a highlighter and cream blush in one compact. I’ll review and swatch them all soon. Patrick Ta added four new shades of the Major Headlines Double-Take Duo ($38 each) but I’m probably going to pass on these (I still think his shade Not Too Much reviewed here is the best neutral). Urban Decay launched their Face Bond Luminizer Waterproof Glow Drops ($34 each) and I’ve been loving the Space Cowboy shade for the perfect champagne glow highlight and PCH is a really pretty one too. These are multi-taskers you can use a number of ways. I am still experimenting with these but thought I’d share quick swatches here. Neutral Eyeshadow Palette I’ve been wearing the Anastasia Beverly Hills Mini Spice Palette  ($29) in a few looks and a number of you asked for swatches. I actually picked this up last year but realized I never swatched it on the blog. I really like the tones and the mix of mattes and shimmers. There a few true mattes in this palette and then some that have a tiny bit of sparkle embedded in them. The pure mattes are smooth and buttery with excellent pigment and color payoff. The mattes that have a tiny bit of sparkle pull sheerer but you can still build them for full pigment. I do think the shimmer and glitters are prone to fall out if you don’t pat them on the lids or pack them on. You’ll have to do some clean up from the fall out but for me the good news is that once they are on the eyes they don’t migrate. As much as I like it, I do think there are better options out there for quality. If you’re looking for a good everyday neutral with mattes and shimmers I still think the Natasha Denona I Need a Nude or I Need a Warm and the Too Faced Born This Way Natural Nudes are better buys. I know the Too Faced palettes have been around forever but out of all the launches over the years, it’s still a solid staple of mine. That wraps up my Sephora haul roundup! Let me know if you want a detailed review on any of these. I will have a full blog post on the YSL and Natasha Denona blushes soon! What have you hauled this January? Any good finds, new loves or misses?",

It’s different from most dry shampoos I’ve tried. The formula seems more liquid/fluid when you spray it on the hair (ie it’s not really an aerosol). I love that it’s clear and doesn’t have any white cast on my hair. Does a great job at absorbing excess oil on Day 2 hair. It kept my hair looking refreshed throughout the day. I don’t know how long it lasts past 24 hours because I’m still the type of person who has to wash her hair almost daily (I’ll go 2 days max without washing my hair).

I actually picked this up last year but realized I never swatched it on the blog. I really like the tones and the mix of mattes and shimmers. There a few true mattes in this palette and then some that have a tiny bit of sparkle embedded in them. The pure mattes are smooth and buttery with excellent pigment and color payoff. The mattes that have a tiny bit of sparkle pull sheerer but you can still build them for full pigment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do think the shimmer and glitters are prone to fall out if you don’t pat them on the lids or pack them on. You’ll have to do some clean up from the fall out but for me the good news is that once they are on the eyes they don’t migrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://thebeautylookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Anastasia-Beverly-Hills-Mini-Spice-Palette.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://thebeautylookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Anastasia-Beverly-Hills-Mini-Spice-Palette-1440x2160.jpg\" alt=\"Anastasia Beverly Hills Mini Spice Palette \" width=\"1080\" height=\"1620\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"Sharing a Sephora haul roundup!
