I hauled nearly all the shades to review and try and after testing these extensively I finally have my review. I think there are some hits with the new launch but I also think there are some definite passes. The Backstage Rosy Glow Powder Blushes ($40 each) have been reformulated a few times already but I have to say I’m really impressed with the latest version. I didn’t have any issues with the previous variations but the newest one has a much better texture that’s easier to blend with better color payoff. 001 Pink is still one of the best baby pink blushes I’ve tried. It’s supposed to be ph-reactive but it really doesn’t shift in color on my skin. It’s a cool toned pink I think works well layered on top of other creams. 103 Toffee is a new shade in the lineup and it’s another winner. The powder has some gold shimmer which I kinda wish they didn’t add, but I do really love the neutral beige tone on the skin. The shimmer isn’t frosty but it is noticeable on the skin. 012 Rosewood is a dusty rose color. I think of this more along the lines of a fall/winter shade but I think it’s a great rose neutral that will work with a wide range of skintones. This one has a tiny bit of glow but isn’t very shimmery. 077 Candy is a coral pink with gold shimmer. It almost reminds me of the NARS Orgasm blush with the pink/gold shift. I love this one. Out of all the shades I think this is my favorite. 063 Pink Lilac is a soft lilac pastel. I really wanted it to work but with my tan skin it pulls a little chalky. I think I can make it work with some layering on top of other cream blush colors but for now, I prefer the older formula over this new one in this particular color 015 Cherry is well outside of my comfort zone for a blush, but I decided to be adventurous and try it anyways. I think it can work with a light hand. I prefer this color on the lips versus the cheeks but it’s still a very pretty one and fun for summer. Backstage Rosy Glow Stick I have mixed feelings about the Backstage Rosy Glow Sticks ($44 each). I think the concept is a nice one but they are too dewy for my skin to wear in hot humid weather alone without setting with some kind of powder. All of these match the coordinating powder versions but once blended they are very sheer on the skin. There is enough pigment that you can see them (except for Toffee which matches my skintone). They are also heavily scented like root beer. It’s a fun kind of scent and doesn’t irritate my skin or nose, but if you’re sensitive to fragranced products this is a definite no. I would have loved these if the formula wasn’t dewy or more long wearing. If you have dry skin or love a balmy glow for the cheeks I think you will love these. For me, I can only wear them if I layer a powder on top. I usually wear some kind of powder blush on top of creams anyways but I don’t see myself reaching for these often. Out of all the shades I think Rosewood and Candy are the best ones. Addict Lip Butter Last we have a look at the Addict Lip Butters ($40 each). I think I could have easily given these an A rating if they gave us more product or something more special. A number of you had some serious rants about these being 1/2 filled. I do think there needs to be some kind of gap in the squeeze tube to accommodate the product from causing the tube to explode but I also think Dior could have done better and given us more product. I rarely look at ounces or grams etc. for makeup products but I agree with the rants on this one. With these tiny tubes I can easily see it being used up in a matter of a few weeks. Size issues aside, I do think the gloss formula is a really nice one. It feels smooth and comfortable on the lips. Pigment is on the sheer side but the colors are pretty, however the only shade I think really stands out to me is the Glazed Lavender. The others I think can be easily duped by e.l.f., Maybelline, Summer Fridays, Fenty and so many other brands at a much better price point with quality and performance that is just as good if not better. Here are the colors on with each color family. Some of them I swatched both the blush stick and powder separately, some I layered together. I am still a match to the Forever Skin Perfect Foundation Stick in 3N. Wearing the Pink Backstage Rosy Blush Glow Stick vs Backstage Rosy Glow Powder Blush and Glazed Pink Lip Butter ___________ Wearing the Toffee Backstage Rosy Blush Glow Stick vs Backstage Rosy Glow Powder Blush and Toffee Lip Butter ___________ Wearing the Candy Backstage Rosy Blush Glow Stick with Backstage Rosy Glow Powder Blush layered on top and the Addict Lip Glow Balm in Candy ___________ Wearing the Pink Lilac Backstage Rosy Blush Glow Stick with Backstage Rosy Glow Powder Blush layered on top and the Glazed Lilac Lip Butter ___________ Below wearing the Rosewood Backstage Rosy Glow Blush Stick vs Backstage Rosy Glow Powder Blush and Lip Maximizer in Rosewood ___________ Wearing the Cherry Backstage Rosy Glow Blush Stick with Cherry Backstage Rosy Glow Powder Blush on top and Lychee Lip Butter ___________ Overall I think the Backstage Rosy Glow Powder Blush is a winner for formula, but if you already own the colors in the older formulas I don’t think you need to get the new ones. I think Candy and Toffee are the best shades. For me the blush sticks are more novel than practical. I will most likely wear one for date nights or special occasions but I don’t see them as being everyday blushes for me. The Lip Butters will be used up entirely but I get way more excited about lip launches from other brands like Summer Fridays or Laneige. You can find all the new launches out now at Dior and Sephora.",

I think I could have easily given these an A rating if they gave us more product or something more special. A number of you had some serious rants about these being 1/2 filled. I do think there needs to be some kind of gap in the squeeze tube to accommodate the product from causing the tube to explode but I also think Dior could have done better and given us more product. I rarely look at ounces or grams etc. for makeup products but I agree with the rants on this one.

I think Candy and Toffee are the best shades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me the blush sticks are more novel than practical.
