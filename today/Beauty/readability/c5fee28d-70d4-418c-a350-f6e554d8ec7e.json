In my vast perfume collection (which contains well over 100 scents), I always find myself gravitating toward robust, extravagant gourmands with notes of comforting vanilla, warm spices, sticky honey, and hints of chocolate that demand attention as I walk by. But if you can believe it, there’s one delectable fragrance note that’s been missing from my collection: caramel. I’ve been searching for a perfume that incorporates the decadent scent for ages, and I finally found it in the new Bond No.9 Gold Street, one of the most luxurious scents I’ve ever smelled.Bond No. 9 Gold StreetI adore when fragrances tell a story, and each of Bond No. 9’s perfumes encapsulates the energy of a different New York City neighborhood. Gold Street, for its part, pays homage to the rich history of the tiny street in the heart of Manhattan’s Financial District. Before wealthy bankers dubbed this area the epicenter of American finance, the small stretch of land was filled with golden wheat farms—and thus gold, whether it be expensive metal bars or flourishing crops, has always been important to this part of the island. And I couldn’t imagine a better scent to personify the area. The stunning, statuesque gold bottle—which happens to be 100 percent recyclable—is the ideal vessel to house the showstopping juice inside. But of course, the important question is what Gold Street smells like. The answer: pure opulence. The new-age scent opens with a medley of expensive aromas: Vintage French leather comes through at the first spritz, along with candied blueberry, sweet jasmine, and a dash of pink pepper, giving it a commanding presence from the start. One waft makes me feel like I’m stepping into a world where gold-lined doorways and red-velvet walkways are the norm.The initial pungency from the leather and peppery spice mellows as smooth suede, lush salted-caramel fudge, and addictive ambrette take center stage. The caramel truly shines and is even magnified when intertwined with the ambrette seed, a plant native to India with a fruity, musky aroma. Together these notes produce a heady tinge reminiscent of plum brandy—syrupy, deeply sweet, and exceedingly intoxicating. When the base notes finally emerge on most perfumes, I can barely catch a fading whiff. Gold Street, however, maintains its powerful aura, as hints of woody oakmoss, warm Madagascar vanilla, and animalistic musk emerge on the dry down. This sumptuous cocktail lingers for hours, wrapping me in a lasting veil of confidence. And now, though I have endless perfumes to mist, Gold Street is the only fragrance I want to wear. Yes, in part that’s because it smells incredible, but the indulgent aroma also instantly boosts my confidence and sets the tone for my day. Whether I spray it before an evening out, prior to a big presentation, or for a special date night, I feel it allows me to put my best foot forward and enter fearlessly into every situation. And beyond how it makes me feel, it’s a consistent compliment magnet—every time I wear it, someone comments on how amazing I smell. If you’ve been searching for a bold signature scent that’s luxe, layered, smooth, and truly unique, Gold Street could be exactly what you’re looking for.",
