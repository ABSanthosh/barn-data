  "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.Fashion Month is finally here to save us from the cold, dark winter nights. Just kidding, it’s still going to be cold and dark, but that doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy watching some outrageous beauty and fashion moments while firmly wrapped up inside in our blankets. Of course, we’ve already had a little taste of what’s to come thanks to Men’s Fashion Week and Couture Week taking over Paris, as well as Copenhagen Fashion Week landing in Denmark’s capital. Tyla took on sub-zero temperatures by turning heads in a navy side slit dress at the Jacquemus Spring/Summer 2025 show and Jenna Ortega proved that black is the new black with her ultra-chic goth girl ensemble at Christian Dior. There were plenty of eye-catching looks on the runways, too, with Willy Chavarria making the case for barely there brows and red hot lips and Schiaparelli proving that sometimes it’s about not overtaking the outfit by embracing a minimalistic slick-back bun. Plus, Copenhagen has been serving us all the street style inspo, with colored faux fur jackets, knitted hoods, and office-appropriate neck ties going straight on our mood boards.As we head into the marathon of women’s shows lined up across New York, London, Milan, and Paris we’re still keeping one eye on all of the major fashion and beauty drops happening across February. From a designer luggage collaboration to a new bouncy mascara, click through to discover all the new launches heading your way this month. Beyoncé and Levi’s Launch Chapter 2When Beyoncé dropped “Levi’s Jeans” on her Grammy-winning album, Cowboy Carter, it was all but inevitable that the superstar would team up with the iconic denim brand in some way. After reimagining a 1985 laundromat-set ad last year, Beyoncé is back with Chapter 2 of her Levi’s Campaign, this time reimagining a 1991 ad. Set to the backdrop of the musician’s country-tinged track, the video (directed by Melina Matsoukas) stars Beyoncé clad in a bedazzled denim outfit at a pool hall, where she takes on Justified actor Timothy Olyphant in a game. Highlighted pieces include Levi’s Ribcage Wide Leg Jeans, Braided Vest, and Spade Trench. “There isn’t another wardrobe piece that evokes comfort, modern elegance, classic Americana attire, and nostalgia the way denim does,” Beyoncé said in a press release.  “And when I think of all those things, I think of Levi’s. For the second chapter in our collaboration we had even more fun in reimagining the denim on denim narrative, through the lens of a woman, who can be sexy, bold and a fierce competitor, all at once. We wanted to celebrate the duality of grace and power.” J.Crew Partners with Barbour to Create the Perfect Barn Jacket J.Crew is teaming up with UK heritage brand Barbour for the first time since 2019, combining creative forces to make the perfect barn jacket. The pair’s answer to the on-trend outerwear piece is made with transitional-weather-friendly waxed cotton, lined with Barbour’s signature tartan, and features a corduroy collar. The limited-edition unisex jacket is available for $425. Shop now at J.Crew. J.Crew x Barbour Limited-Edition Barn Jacket, $, available at J.CrewVictoria's Secret Launches Designer Collaboration With AltuzarraVictoria’s Secret has unveiled a new designer series: Atelier Victoria’s Secret x Alturzarra.

The debut spring 2025 collection features 11 pieces focused on closet basics, such as a bodysuit in the style of a classic white button-up shirt, a satin trench coat, tailored black trousers, a knit cropped cardigan, and a fitted wool blazer. “With this partnership, I wanted to bring my perspective to a brand known for celebrating femininity and sensuality,” Altuzarra said in a press release. “I focused on pieces that felt effortless and sensual, and imbued them with subtle elements of discovery — classic wardrobe styles, but always with a twist.” Prices range from $95 to $500.Shop now at Victoria’s Secret Atelier Victoria's Secret x Altuzarra Satin Bias-Cut Dress, $, available at Victoria's SecretMango Launches Selection Collection Mango has dropped a new edition of its Selection Collection — a premium line that emphasizes high-level tailoring and luxe fabrics — for warm weather.

That’s how much the duo loves the Paris-based label. So, naturally, when they were ready to launch Casalina’s first fashion collaboration, they wanted it to be with Rowen Rose. Enter the new Rowen Rose x Casalina collection, which was inspired by the Amalfi Coast and the image Mize and McKinley held dear. The limited-edition capsule features five styles — all of which are red — that can be mixed and matched: a one-piece swimsuit with a keyhole cut-out, a bikini, a maxi skirt, and two vacation-ready dresses. Prices range from $230 to $525. Shop now at Casalina.

Essentially a type of peptide, or protein, growth factors can stimulate skin cell growth over time, boosting the collagen and elastin which naturally depletes as we age. When used in skincare, they can have promising results for fine lines, with some calling growth factors \"Botox in a bottle\" — hence why they feature in Medik8’s latest serum. Packed with Dual MiniProteins™, the serum aims to combine the \"deep penetration of peptides with the enhanced potency of proteins\" helping to support skin structure and bring back firmness to the face. Further enhanced by moisture-grabbing hyaluronic acid and a skin barrier-saving prebiotic complex, the serum is all about achieving smoother skin.Shop now at Medik8Medik8 Liquid Peptides Advanced Face Serum, $, available at Medik8RIMOWA x Rick Owens It just got even more exciting to travel with a Rimowa suitcase. The high-end suitcase brand has teamed up with the Lord of Darkness himself, aka legendary designer Rick Owens. The collaboration infuses Owens’ minimalist edge with Rimowa’s sleek and minimalist design and sees the Original Cabin Bronze suitcase transformed using a manual pigmentation process. The result is a dark aged effect on the suitcases’ aluminum exterior, with each case having its own distinct finish. Plus, the interior has been upgraded to all-black leather and the suitcase is finished off with a cowhide luggage tag for a subtle touch of texture.Shop now at RIMOWARimowa x Rick Owens Cabin, $, available at RimowaCalvin Klein Returns to New York Fashion WeekCalvin Klein returned to New York Fashion Week for the first time in six and a half years!

Klein himself was in attendance at the show, which really leaned into the brand’s signature minimalist style.Megan Trainor x e.l.f.
