  "description": "I feel pretty clean for having just showered with someone else's bathwater. Yes, you read that right. In all fairness, the water once belonged to \"Euphoria\" it-girl and Gen-Z bombshell Sydney Sweeney. It comes encapsulated in an unassuming turquoise bar of Dr. Squatch soap (aptly named \"Sydney's Bathwater Bliss\"), has already sold out, and is continuing to inspire some passionate think-pieces. While supporters applaud Sweeney for profiting off the very demographic that sexualizes her, others say her pandering to men is setting women back decades. Admittedly, her \"hey boys\" advertising isn't exactly subtle. But marketing aside, people have also expressed some valid concerns about washing with a celebrity's old bathwater. Given its divisiveness, I decided to try it for myself. One thing to note: I understand the majority of people are not buying this product purely for its antimicrobial properties. But as a more (ahem) unbiased consumer, I feel I can share an honest review of the soap itself - the good, the bad, and the gross. Read on to get my initial thoughts, feelings, and a few legitimate red flags about bathing in someone else's bathwater (even if it is Sweeney's). First Impressions of the Dr. Squatch Sydney's Bathwater Bliss Soap Waiting on the curb for my bar of bathwater soap was a deeply humbling experience. I accepted the parcel as if it were contraband, scurrying into my apartment lest someone spot the suspicious transaction taking place. I smelled the soap before I even freed it from its packaging - a strong pine scent that reminded me of a men's cologne or my dad's deodorant. Upon further inspection, I read that the scent (pine, moss, and Douglas fir) is called \"morning wood\" . . . groan. Contrary to rumors on the internet, the soap does not have a hole in the middle of it. I'm not sure where this theory came from, but a part of me feels like people were just looking for another reason to hate on the soap. While the marketing certainly isn't discreet, it's disappointing to see people criticizing Sweeney for a nonexistent product feature. And frankly, if thousands of men are willing to buy her literal bathwater . . . that feels like more of a \"them\" problem. What I Liked I've done plenty of editor experiments over the years, but this one gave me pause. Despite its sexy marketing, the idea of using someone else's bathwater still teetered into \"gross\" territory for me. But I took one for the team, and used the bar in the shower . . . for science. The soap had a soft lather and added grittiness made from sand and pumice granules for exfoliation purposes. The pine scent was pleasant, if not a little manly, and I was happy that my skin didn't feel dried out afterward (as it often does with bar soap). When all was said and done, I felt pretty clean, despite having just washed myself with someone else's bathwater. There's also something to be said about the novelty of it all, especially if you're a do-it-for-the-plot type of person. What to Consider Per the ingredient list, each bar of soap allegedly contains a small amount of Sweeney's real bathwater (consequently, there were only 5,000 bars made). Still, washing in someone else's bathwater does present a few health concerns. For starters, bathwater can contain contaminants like bacteria and other microorganisms. This may increase the risk of infection or skin irritation, especially for people with compromised immune systems. As previously noted on Walmart's website, the soap should not be used on any cuts or abrasions, presumably for this exact reason. The Bottom Line I can't say I'd jump to wash with someone else's bathwater again, but I also think the hate is a little forced. To me, Sweeney's bathwater soap felt like more of a gimmick than anything else . . . but at least it was relatively functional (and priced at only $9). Calling a bar of soap anti-feminist when we know that men have been sexualizing Sweeney from the jump feels like a bit of a reach. The marketing isn't my personal favorite either, but I'm glad she's getting paid. I'm glad there's no hole. And frankly, if it encourages men to wash themselves more thoroughly, I'm all for it.
