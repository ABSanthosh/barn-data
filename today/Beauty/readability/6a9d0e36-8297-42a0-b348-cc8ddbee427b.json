  "description": "Image Source: Steve Eichner/WWD via Getty Images We'll be honest: we almost didn't recognize Kim Kardashian when she was recently photographed in Paris, France. During Paris Haute Couture Week, Kardashian was seen roaming the streets with a completely new hairstyle. Gone was the ultra-long, super wavy hair we saw at the Bezos/Sanchez wedding just the week before. Instead, the \"The Kardashians\" star was seen sporting a lob haircut with a severe side part and dollop bangs. Although the reality star is known for changing up her look almost every time she goes outside, she was seen on two occasions with the same retro-inspired swoop bang. This has us wondering, could this be a more permanent look? Dollop bangs, also known as kiss curls, were everywhere at the 2025 Met Gala, and they've been seen on an array of celebrities, from Bad Bunny to Sydney Sweeney. \"[It's] a style of fringe where the bangs are cut and styled with a rounded shape that lifts slightly away from the forehead, resembling a dollop of whipped cream or mousse,\" says Los Angeles and New York City-based colorist and stylist Jacob Sirianno. \"They're not flat, blunt, or overly thick but instead maintain a sense of fullness and lightness. This gives a fun, retro-inspired vibe.\" Kardashian's dollop bangs added the perfect touch to her bouncy, shoulder-length lob, which featured rounded, flipped-in ends. If you're thinking of trying the trend for yourself, know that you don't have to chop your hair to achieve the same result. Instead, you can opt to style a section of hair with gel or a hair cream to get a faux bang that looks similar to what celebrities have been sporting lately. If you're in the mood for more inspiration, take a closer look at Kardashian's dollop bangs, ahead.
