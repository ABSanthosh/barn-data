  "description": "Whenever Taylor Swift attends a Kansas City Chiefs game to support her boyfriend, football tight end Travis Kelce, all eyes are on her: what will she wear? Will she keep her signature red lipstick or try a new hue? What A-lister friends will she bring with her in the box? At the game on Oct. 7 against the New Orleans Saints, the singer arrived at the stadium wearing a gray and red plaid, off-the-shoulder mini dress, a flirty high ponytail, and glitter freckles that now have everyone clamoring to learn how to recreate them. Swift's glitter freckles included dots of silver and red sprawled across her nose and cheeks, which complemented her red lipstick and cat eyeliner. The unexpected yet perfectly executed beauty detail was the cherry on top of her entire look. Anyone who's ever attempted faux freckles knows the application process can be a bit tedious, but Swift had a little help from a small business called Fazit Beauty. The brand makes freckle patches that come in sheets and act as a temporary tattoo for your face, saving you time on painstakingly applying each freckle. For Swift's glitter freckles, it appears she used the Fazit Silver Glitter Freckles Makeup Patches ($16), which also come in gold. Fazit's founder, Aliett Butts, explained in a TikTok video that she sent Swift's makeup artist, Lorrie Turk, a few patches in the spring of 2023 in hopes of getting the brand on the star's radar, but she didn't know if it would happen. Now, months later, it seems to have worked. Ahead, see another photo of Swift's glitter freckles and head over to Fazit's website to get yours - we have a feeling these are going to be everywhere this football season.
