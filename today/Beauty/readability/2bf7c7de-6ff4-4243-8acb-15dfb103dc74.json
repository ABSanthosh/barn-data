  "text": "Those who follow me on Instagram may already know this but I mentioned in a recent post about how it’s honestly difficult for me to set aside time for treating myself, especially now that I have a baby. There will always be a million excuses in my head for all the tasks that need to be completed which is only compounded by the fact that I work full-time from home while also taking care of Aria full-time as well. Yes, I do plan on eventually getting childcare help but for now I’m just trying to embrace this relatively short time to have her closer and save a bit of money! Unfortunately, that also takes up large swaths of my free time which is usually spent scrubbing bottles or folding seemingly endless piles of laundry. That’s why I, and my ever-amazing partners Aveeno, have realized that it’s more important to put my “me time” as a priority in my schedule since otherwise it will inevitably just never happen. Any other ladies out there feel the same way? Can I get an amen over here? Basically, my tactic is to either full-on leave the house for appointments like a spa treatment or massage once in a while (which you definitely deserve, let this not even be a question) OR do what is much more realistic for fitting into my hectic daily schedule which is to be 10x more efficient at things I do throughout the day so that I can spare a bit of time to myself each evening. That’s why I wanted to share a few time-saving hacks that I’ve found makes a busy life run a little smoother by the end of the day. You may have noticed a couple of my favorite pampering steps were taking advantage of the Aveeno Positively Radiant line like the 60 Second In-Shower Facial which works with the steam of your shower to kick your regular exfoliation up a notch. Ben (aka Mr. Toe as he has been affectionately dubbed by some followers) who typically loathes any complicated skincare routine even gives this one a thumbs up. The Aveeno Positively Radiant Overnight Hydrating Facial is another one that, dare I say, harkens to sleep masks in the Korean skincare routines I was raised with. I apply this before bedtime and wake up with hydrated, radiant skin. It’s that hyaluronic acid, baby. It does wonders with very little extra effort by me. The further along I’ve gotten in this whole parenting thing, the more strongly I’ve realized that women who take care of themselves set an important example for their children, which in the long run will mean so much more than if all the dishes didn’t get cleaned before bedtime for a night. Don’t forget to build yourself back up first so that you can take care of everyone else better!",
