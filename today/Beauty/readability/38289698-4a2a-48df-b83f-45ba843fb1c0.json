(Or something like that.) The masses like to call this the Meghan Markle Effect - and not even her glam squad is immune. In fact, ever since news got out that Markle's makeup artist and longtime friend Daniel Martin was behind her wedding look back in May, his schedule has been booked solid. \"If I'm going to continue taking care of other people, I've learned that I also deserve to take care of myself as well.\" \"Because of the global exposure it's given me, I've gotten to do more collaborations and partnerships outside of just beauty,\" Martin says. It also means a sh*t ton more partnerships, interviews, parties, celebrity gigs, and, yeah, airline miles. It's fun, of course, but not a walk in the park: \"[2020] was an awakening of sorts for me both professionally and personally and in the end, if I'm going to continue taking care of other people, I've learned that I also deserve to take care of myself as well.\" Ahead, Martin peels back the curtain on what work looks like for him. Let's just say, this isn't your average 9-to-5. And his shoes? A little more regal.",
