Any beauty product you see here has been vetted and tested by the editor recommending it.When you're beauty editor who's spent more than a decade testing products, there comes a point when not much impresses you anymore. That's not to say that I'm completely jaded: I still find true joy in discovering a new favorite formula and get giddy over a real, game-changing innovation — even a simple one. So for something as seemingly basic as a facial cleanser to get my attention — and even free up some space in my daily routine for it — it really has to be something special.See: Rhode's Pineapple Refresh cleanser, a creamy gel face wash that gently exfoliates, brightens and smooths skin as it whisks away makeup and impurities. The pale yellow formula gets sudsy as you work it into damp skin, but it's not so foamy that it's drying or irritating to eyes. (Actually, it's opthalmologist-tested, per the brand.) I love that it's a single step that packs in plenty of benefits, thanks to an impressive ingredient lineup: polyglutamic acid (PGA, a humectant that pulls moisture into skin), green tea extract (an antioxidant-rich ingredient that soothes and protects against damage) and pineapple enzyme (a gentle but impactful exfoliator). Plus, its water-and-glycerin base also boosts skin's moisture as it cleanses.It leaves skin feeling  supple, bouncy, hydrated — glazed, if you will (Rhode founder Hailey Bieber wouldn't have it any other way) — and the level of exfoliation can be customized by preference. Rinse it off immediately for less exfoliation; let it sit on skin for five minutes if you want something a bit more intensive.And it really is effective. In an era of double cleansing, I was super impressed by a video skinfluencer Charlotte Palermino made using a UV camera to test whether the formula could successfully remove her full face of sunscreen (it could!), but my good, old-fashioned face-full-of-makeup/white-face-towel test also confirmed as much.Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesThe fragrance-free formula is also cruelty-free and vegan, and despite its exfoliating power, it's approved for sensitive skin, even with twice-a-day use. (As someone with an often reactive, rosacea-prone complexion, I can confirm this is true.) That said, I still wouldn't recommend using it post-procedure or in conjunction with other super intensive exfoliators — that's a recipe for way too much spice.Rhode, as it's proven time and time again, is one of the celebrity beauty brands that doesn't suck. And this cleanser is an especially good example of that for me. Rhode Pineapple Refresh PGA Daily Cleanser, $30, available hereHomepage photo: Courtesy of RhodePlease note: This product was gifted.
