  "text": "Within an increasingly saturated environment of buzzy brands, content creators and major industry players, entering the beauty sphere as an aspiring professional is no small feat. Newcomers often face plenty of barriers to entry, specifically securing much-needed funding for their beauty-based educations, cosmetology programs or required licensures. In the U.S., most cosmetology school programs cost less than $20,000 to complete, compared to the average full-time in-state college student paying approximately $11,610 in tuition for the 2024-2025 school year, according to CollegeBoard data.But it's in major beauty brands' best interest to help foster the next generation of talent. So of course, plenty of companies seek to do so through specialized program grants, school-exclusive scholarships and national sweepstakes. There's a scholarship avenue for every beauty-related skill set, including brand building, hairstyling, makeup artistry, esthetics, fragrance formulation, massage therapy and more. Some scholarships —such as Milk Makeup's Visionary Fund Scholarship (in partnership with the Fashion School Fund) — offer specific opportunities for BIPOC students exploring digital branding and marketing, while others — like Dermalogica's Future Industry Professionals Esthetics Scholarship — are geared toward those pursuing a career in cosmetology.Ahead, we've rounded up a list of beauty-centric scholarships that are available now for students venturing into the industry — many of which are currently accepting applications.
