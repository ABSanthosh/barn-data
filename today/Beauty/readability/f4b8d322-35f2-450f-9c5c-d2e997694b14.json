  "description": "Welcome to Show the Receipts, a series where we ask industry insiders to break down exactly how much it costs to get things done. From start to finish, we track every last dollar. Up next: what it takes to get a celebrity's hair Oscars-ready. Hollywood's biggest night means we all become beauty critics ready to judge A-listers' looks from our sweats in the comfort of our living rooms. When our favorite celebrity hits the Oscars red carpet with perfectly coiffed waves or a slicked-back bun, it's easy to assume their look came together effortlessly. Still, behind the scenes, teams of stylists prep for this occasion months in advance and budget for it even longer. For celebrity hairstylist Jerrod Roberts, who styled Hannah Einbinder for the \"Vanity Fair\" Oscars After Party, the prep is anything but effortless. \"Oscars bookings happen at least a month in advance. . . people don't always realize how much goes into styling hair for the Oscars,\" says Roberts. \"From the tools to the extensions, the costs add up fast.\" Some of the biggest hidden expenses include specialized hair pins and bungees only available in Paris and an extensive collection of high-end irons, brushes, and rollers. For an event like the Oscars, restocking hero products and acquiring any necessary hairpieces is essential. \"I always update my kit before awards season,\" Roberts says. \"Whether it's new products, extra extensions, or custom accessories, I like to be prepared for anything.\" Sometimes, beauty brands send him products to test on clients, but many of the high-quality tools he uses - like Mason Pearson brushes and specialized round brushes - are personal investments. Surprises are inevitable when working an event as high-profile as the Oscars. \"One time, a client decided last-minute that they wanted a short-hair moment but couldn't actually cut their hair for a project,\" Roberts says. \"I had to buy a wig for over $700 and style it the night before.\" Costs add up quickly, from restocking high-end products to investing in custom hairpieces, here's what it really takes - and costs - to create a picture-perfect Oscars look. Here's the full cost breakdown. Task: Styling Hair for the Oscars Job: Celebrity hairstylist Location: Los Angeles, CA Timeline: 1 month The Receipts Styling Fees \u0026 Essentials: $1,000 - $3,000 per client Hair Extensions \u0026 Accessories: $800 - $2,000 Specialized Tools \u0026 Maintenance: $6,125 (tools, french pins, full kit upkeep) Restocking \u0026 Custom Pieces: $1,350 - $2,150 (products, fake fringes, ponytails, custom wig) Brushes \u0026 Basics: $350 (Mason Pearson brush + round brush) Total Estimated Cost: $9,625 - $13,625 (varies by client/event needs) How I Did It PS: Can you walk us through the total cost of doing hair for a celebrity at the Oscars? From travel to products, what goes into it? Jerrod Roberts: For certain red carpet events, the cost can range from $1,000 to $3,000. If I need to buy extensions ($600-$1,000) or hair accessories ($200-$1,000), I usually cover those expenses myself. I'm fortunate to now live in LA, but when I was based in NYC, I had to purchase my plane tickets and pay for my hotel when coming out for the Oscars. PS: What are some of the biggest expenses that people might not realize come with styling an A-lister for a major event like the Oscars? JR: The biggest expenses are tools, pins, and hair extensions. I have a collection of irons, ranging from very small to very large, which cost hundreds of dollars ($800). I also use specialized hair pins and bungees that can only be found in France, so I restock every time I'm in Paris. My full hair kit, which includes extensions and ponytails in every shade from blond to black, costs upwards of $5,000 - plus priceless sets of hot rollers I've collected over the years that are no longer made. PS: What's an expense that is absolutely worth the splurge when prepping for an award show? JR: Brushes. I only use boar bristle hairbrushes, and my Mason Pearson brush costs $250. Each of my round brushes is priced between $75 and $100. PS: How do you financially prepare for the Oscars? Is it something you budget for months in advance? JR: I plan for the money going into awards season before it happens. At this point in my career, I feel like I've got most of what I need for an awards season, but I always plan on buying extra hair or accessories for clients. PS: What budgeting advice would you give aspiring hairstylists wanting to break into styling celebrities for the Oscars? JR: Learn to save your money and build your kit up over time. The nature of working as a celebrity hairdresser is that your money is always in flux. I've learned to save my money when I get paid for bigger jobs and keep it for when I need it for slower periods or unexpected expenses. I started building my kit when I was an assistant. I would buy a few things here and there, and eventually, I had a decent styling kit. As I became more successful, I started to upgrade the various parts of my kit, like my brushes, or add to my iron collection. Also, don't put all your eggs in one basket. Try to diversify the way you make your money. Whether social media, cutting hair in a salon, or working with product brands/education, having more than one way to get income will save you. The last five years hit the celebrity hairdresser industry hard. We had COVID and back-to-back strikes, which halted productions and red-carpet events, and many of us were forced to find other ways to keep the money coming in. Final Thoughts From custom wigs to top-tier tools, the price of creating a flawless Oscars look is anything but small. But in an industry where reputation is everything, the investment isn't just about one night - it's about staying at the top of the game. Styling a celebrity for the Oscars is as much an investment as it is an art. The costs add up quickly, but there's no cutting corners in an industry where every detail matters. For many stylists, the payoff isn't just in the paycheck - it's in seeing their work on one of the most-watched red carpets in the world. And when the cameras flash and the look goes viral, the expense feels like just another part of the job.
