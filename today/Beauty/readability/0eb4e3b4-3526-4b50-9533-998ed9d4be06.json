  "description": "Well, we might be about to chop all of our hair off. The truth is, we barely made it out alive with our shoulder length hair two years ago, after Hailey Bieber decided to go full snip mode but now that we've seen Sofia Richie's latest cut - a bouncy French bob - we've decided it's too chic to ignore. On June 21, the model posted a carousel showcasing her new look with the simplest of captions: \"French Bob,\" with a tag for her stylist, George Curran. Richie also posted a video on her TikTok account where she takes viewers step-by-step through the entire process. \"I've been thinking long and hard about this,\" Richie says in the video, explaining that she did \"one too many keratin treatments\" on her hair, but has been unable to get her dead ends to go away. \"So, we're cutting a bob,\" she says with finality. The video spans a full five minutes, and we see Richie go through the entire haircut process with Curran at Richie's home. \"I love my bob,\" Richie says about halfway through the video, while her hair is still wet and un-styled. And in news that will shock absolutely no one - it looks even better blown out and styled. @sofiagrainge Call me Bob @georgecurranhair ♬ original sound - Sofia Richie Grainge Richie isn't the first celebrity to embrace the French bob this year. Both Pamela Anderson and Zoe Saldaña debuted French bobs with micro bangs at the 2025 Met Gala, and we honestly think it could be shaping up to be the haircut of the summer. \"A French bob haircut is a short, chin-length cut,\" says hairstylist Raven Hurtado. It's a great way to get rid of dead ends, if you, like Richie, have some damage to your hair from using hot tools or one too many styling treatments. Plus, it's easy - and fast - to style. \"You can air dry or heat style,\" says Hurtado. \"For a tousled look, air dry using a mousse (you can also add a diffuser). To heat style, you can use a round brush and blow dry going under.\" Keep scrolling for a closer look at Richie's new cut, but only if you're prepared to want to make a salon appointment ASAP. It's that good.
