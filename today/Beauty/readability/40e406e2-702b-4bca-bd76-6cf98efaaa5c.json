  "text": "My favorite types of videos are those of people listing their expenses and creating a budget tracker to pinpoint where to cut costs. Naturally, I joined the trend and itemized my own spending over the past few months. To my surprise, it wasn’t my car note or insurance that shocked me—it was the realization that my monthly (and sometimes bi-monthly) nail appointments were costing just as much. Spending $145 on a gel-extension set or $45 on a gel manicure always felt like a well-earned reward for getting through the workweeks. However, seeing the total add up on a spreadsheet made one thing painfully clear: it’s time to trade my luxury nail habit for a more budget-friendly alternative.I set out to build my at-home nail salon from the ground up, perusing pages on Amazon to find the right gel nail polishes, prep tools, and, most importantly, a UV or LED nail lamp to bring my visions to life. While carefully parsing the nail lamp results, my eyes gravitated toward a familiar one with a hot pink arm cushion on top. It was the exact one I vividly remember from my go-to nail salon during all my visits, and it has a name: Sunuv 48W UV Lamp. I didn’t second guess it or consider the differences between a UV lamp and an LED one—if it was good enough for a professional salon, it’s good enough for my makeshift one. Turns out, UV and LED lamps serve the same purpose but operate differently. SUNUV UV LED Nail Lamp“LED lamps are faster, curing in about 30 seconds compared to the two to three minutes for UV lamps. UV lamps may generate more heat and can potentially cause discomfort during curing, while LED lamps stay cooler. However, UV lamps are more versatile and can cure all types of gels, while LED lamps can only cure LED-specific gels,” says Lily Nguyen, celebrity manicurist and founder of Labo Beauté Salon. Generally, UV lamps are the more powerful of the two, typically used “in some professional settings for nail enhancements like builder gels and hard gels, which require a strong and consistent cure. UV lamps help ensure a long-lasting, chip-resistant manicure lasting up to three weeks or more,” Nguyen adds. My package arrived in two days (shout out to Amazon Prime) and was put to work almost instantly. Courtesy of Nerisha PenroseAll of my tools.The gel of choice was Pear Nova “After Party,” a shimmering charcoal shade that darkened with every coat. The instructions on the back of the polish say to cure for 60 seconds under a UV lamp. I did as advised, applying a sheer coat first and touch-testing my nails once the timer ended to ensure they were dry. Next, I went in with a second coat to build the pigment and dried for another 60 seconds. The color payoff was beautiful, but I noticed my nails were about 90 percent dry with a tacky film. I opted against curing again and used a Beetles Gel Top Coat to seal them. Every nail was fully dried after that last cure and my dark grey shimmering nails were picture perfect and ready to be seen. Courtesy of Nerisha PenroseFirst coat. Courtesy of Nerisha PenroseSecond and final coat. My love affair with the Sunuv lamp continues to this day, thanks to its many benefits. Before I mention its positives, I have one caveat: it’s non-rechargeable and requires a cord to operate, which limits mobility. That aside, the capacious interior eliminates the fear of smudging—an offense I repeated during my in-salon visits that crippled me with anxiety each time I returned. And because this lamp is a signature part of my nail sessions, I knew the bottom plate was removable, making gel pedicures easier to complete. Equipped with 33 LED lights spanning its interior, this lamp cures gel polish in 10, 30, 60, or 90 seconds and features a hands-free sensor for a more customized experience. The soft hot pink hand rest on top is a thoughtful touch, providing a steady surface for polishing your non-dominant hand or giving someone else a manicure. Over time, my collection grew from the nail lamp, polishes, and tools to protective wear. “You should apply a sunscreen of 30 SPF or higher [to your hands],” says Gina Edwards, celebrity manicurist and KISS Nails brand ambassador. “Wear UV protection gloves,” she adds, both of which help prevent any skin damage or premature signs of aging. Having spent the past two years with this lamp, I can confidently say it’s one of the best beauty investments I’ve made. It delivers salon-quality results at a fraction of the cost ($40, people!), and despite its one minor drawback, its efficiency, versatility, and affordability far outweigh the inconvenience of a cord. Whether you're a DIY nail enthusiast or simply looking to cut down on salon visits, the Sunuv lamp proves that at-home manicures can be just as satisfying—if not more—than the professional experience.",
