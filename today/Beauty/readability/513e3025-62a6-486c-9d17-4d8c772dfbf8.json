  "description": "It's no secret that celebrities are a constant source of beauty inspiration. Lucky for us, over the last few years, they've gotten a lot more transparent about what it takes to look that good. Sure, they have experienced glam teams on speed dial and hefty budgets to splurge on the best of the best skin-care formulas, but their access to plastic and cosmetic surgery procedures is really what makes a world of difference. Celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Chrissy Teigen, and Bella Hadid have all been very open about the treatments they've had done, but there's a new trend sweeping Hollywood that's a little less obvious: the quiet facelift. The procedures celebrities are gravitating toward these days aren't your average, dramatic surgeries that make you look like a completely different person. There's been a shift to more undetectable procedures that change your features but in an obscure way. Similar to no-makeup makeup, the quiet facelift allows you to look super lifted and youthful without giving it away that you've done anything major to enhance your appearance. This new trend extends past Hollywood - Gen Z and Millennials are opting to take the full plunge, too. To learn more about the quiet facelift trend, we tapped a board-certified plastic surgeon to give some more clarity. Whether you're feeling inspired by your favorite star or particularly experimental with your beauty regimen, we're breaking down all there is to know about the quiet facelift, from its cost to its pros and cons. Experts Featured in This Article Akshay Sanan, MD, FACS, is a board-certified plastic surgeon at Boston Facial Plastics in Massachusetts. What Is a Quiet Facelift? Simply put, a quiet facelift is the more unassuming, advanced version of a traditional facelift, providing more natural and long-lasting results minus the obvious signs of surgery. \"It's a modern, subtle approach to facial rejuvenation that enhances a patient's natural features without making it obvious they've had work done,\" board-certified plastic surgeon Akshay Sanan, MD, says. \"This procedure is an extended deep plane facelift and neck lift, meaning it releases and repositions deeper layers of the face, including the SMAS (superficial musculoaponeurotic system) and ligaments, rather than simply pulling the skin tight,\" which is what a traditional facelift does. This helps \"preserve a natural, effortless look,\" avoiding an overdone appearance. How Much Does a Quiet Facelift Cost? The cost of getting a quiet facelift is hefty and can vary based on the practice you go to. If done by a double board-certified plastic surgeon like Dr. Sanan, the procedure can range anywhere from $50,000 to $65,000. \"The price is higher if additional procedures like a brow lift, upper blepharoplasty, or lip lift are performed at the same time,\" Dr. Sanan adds. @drsananmd The \"Quiet Facelift Trend\" is redefining rejuvenation. #boston #plasticsurgeon #facelift #necklift #deepplanesurgery ♬ original sound - Dr. Sanan | Plastic Surgeon Pros and Cons of a Quiet Facelift While the risks of getting a surgical procedure differ for everyone, there are some general things to know about a quiet facelift. On the pros list, you get natural-looking results that last longer than other treatments like fillers or lasers. On the other hand, there's a longer recovery of 10-14 days. During this period of initial downtime, you can expect to experience some swelling and bruising. After that, it may take several months to fully heal, but Dr. Sanan notes that you may return to your normal activities (such as work) within three to four weeks. He recommends products like the LotFancy Face Ice Pack Wrap ($17) and Boiron Arnicare Pain Relief Gel ($9, originally $13) to help ease recovery. Who Should Get a Quiet Facelift? According to Dr. Sanan, the perfect candidate for this surgery is a person in their early 40s or 50s experiencing any looseness in their skin, from mild to moderate jowls, neck laxity, or deepening nasolabial folds. Aside from age, getting a quiet facelift is best for those who want to look rejuvenated without compromising their facial identity. What to Consider Before Getting a Quiet Facelift \"The most important factor is choosing a highly skilled, double-board certified facial plastic surgeon with expertise in deep plane techniques to ensure natural-looking results,\" Dr. Sanan says. Although the results may look subtle, the quiet facelift involves repositioning deep facial structures for a long-lasting effect. \"Patients should also consider the commitment to recovery, have realistic expectations, and understand that while the results are subtle and refined, they are still significant surgical enhancements,\" he says. And, of course, before anything, consult with a qualified surgeon to determine what procedure is best for you.
