Keep reading for the piercings you'll see everywhere this year — and get ready to load up on inspiration for your next trip to the studio.Experts Featured in This ArticleJennifer Turner is the piercing and innovation director at Banter by Piercing Pagoda.Brian Keith Thompson is a celebrity piercer and the owner of Body Electric Tattoo in Los Angeles.Unique Cartilage PiercingsCartilage piercings will continue to trend this year. Tragus piercings (through the piece of cartilage protruding in front of the ear canal) and helix (in the cartilage of the outer edge or top of the ear) piercings are very common at many studios. Banter piercing director Jennifer Turner has also been seeing lots of rook (in the cartilage of the inner ear) and conch (in the middle part of the ear's cartilage) piercings lately as well. Celebrities are especially into conch piercings lately, with Rihanna and Kylie Jenner both making the location mainstream.Yellow GoldBring on the gold jewelry in 2025. Yellow gold is \"still king,\" celebrity piercer Brian Keith Thompson says, sharing that about 80 percent of his clientele asks for it. If yellow gold isn't your thing, try white gold, which makes up the rest of Thompson's inventory. \"I hardly work in rose gold anymore,\" he adds. Nontraditional Face PiercingsNon-traditional face piercings come to the front of the line this year. While septum piercings, a nose piercing that goes through your septum, have been popular for some time now, Turner doesn't expect to see them going anywhere anytime soon. Even more so, they'll be paired with other piercings, like snake bites, for maximum self-expression.Vertical Ear StacksDress up your lobes a little more this year with a vertical stack. Vertical ear stacks \"feature one or more ear piercings stacked above traditional lobe piercings,\" says Turner. Combine identical earrings for a streamlined look, or switch it up with different types of jewelry for a unique, eclectic look.Navel PiercingsY2K trends are back, and that includes the iconic navel piercing. Belly button piercings, which were huge in the '90s and 2000s, are popular again with the younger generation, Turner says. Choose from endless jewelry options, from simple studs to intricate hoops, to spice up any midriff-baring outfit.Statement JewelryThis year, more is more. Say goodbye to minimalist, dainty jewelry and hello to statement pieces that can act as a focal point for your whole look. It's a \"fun, easy way to add a bold element to your look,\" says Turner. Use one statement piece to tie your look together, or combine a few different standout pieces if you have multiple piercings. Catharine Malzahn is a former PS contributor.",
