  "description": "Image Source: Getty Becky G's hair often tells a story, but unless you're one of her millions of super fans, you might have missed it. On the cover of her most recent studio album \"Encuentros,\" for example, Becky G sits with her eyes closed and chin tilted toward the sun as a gorgeous view of her hometown of Los Angeles expands behind her. Her hair is braided similarly to the Mexican style worn during traditional ballet folklórico dancing, with a single plait extending past her waist and accessories woven throughout. And, once \"Encuentros\" launched into the world this past October, she chopped it off to close the chapter. \"On the braid [were] all of these little trinkets that represent the parts of me that I found along the way while making the album,\" Becky G tells me over the phone. \"Cutting it was this offering.\" Even before Becky G was a literal pop star, she imagined herself with hair that looked the part as far back as the early 2000s, when she was growing up in Inglewood, California. So yeah, she was into manifesting before she even knew it was a thing. \"There was a lot of play involved when it came to beauty,\" she says. \"For me, self-expression was just something I was taught since I was really young. My mom was very encouraging of me expressing myself through glam, through hair, through makeup, and so I feel like when I got into the industry, it just felt right. It didn't scare me. It didn't feel intimidating. It felt like, 'No, I'm going to be a pop star - I've got to have pop star hair.'\" Now, Becky G says, her hair is the healthiest it's ever been, thanks in part to her new partnership with Garnier Fructis, a natural collab for the star during her regrowth journey. \"Hair is super, super important to me,\" she says. \"I knew really early on in my career, as things started to pick up and I was a lot more booked and busy, that protecting my hair was really important.\" Among Becky G's \"holy grail\" products is the Garnier's Sleek and Stay Serum ($11). \"It just changed the game for me,\" she says. \"Even if I am not going to actually style my hair, I still put it in my hair because it feels so yummy and healthy.\" So how does someone with over 37 million Instagram followers, who is constantly touring and performing at awards shows and collaborating with mega beauty brands, protect her peace? Becky G reveals that staying grounded is all about keeping a tight-knit circle around her to help her unwind from the demands of Hollywood. \"I don't know how to not work, but I've actually realized that prioritizing my mental health and grounding with the people who knew me before any of this, it really does something for me. I feel more rested. I feel more present. I actually feel like I can go harder at work.\" She manages to bridge the gap between family and work by including her loved ones in her projects, like in her latest Garnier commercial. \"I literally brought my family to work to keep things balanced,\" she says. \"My friend Massara produced the soundtrack song for the commercial, but also, a fun fact that I haven't shared with anybody is that the DJ I go on the road with is actually my cousin, DJ Awsumo, and he has a little cameo in the commercial too.\" Image Source: Garnier For Becky G, a Pisces, who just celebrated her birthday earlier this month, staying busy actually contributes to her artistic process. \"It's just a very creative time right now, and I'm really happy to be tapped into that,\" she says. \"And I always say too, in order to write about life, you have to live it. Leaving room for all of that has been very fruitful for my creativity.\" Brittany Leitner (she/her) is a New York-based contributing beauty writer at PS.
