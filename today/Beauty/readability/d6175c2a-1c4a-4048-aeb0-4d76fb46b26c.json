  "description": "Jessica Alba just got a brand new tattoo, and it already has fans speculating about its meaning. On February 26, 2025, the actor and Honest Company founder posted an Instagram carousel featuring a photo of her sitting in a tattoo appointment with artist Daniel Winter. Her newest ink is a fine-line design that appears to read \"life is transformation is life,\" and the caption on her post reads \"The current chapter.\" While the exact meaning behind her tattoo is unclear, many are theorizing that it relates to her impending divorce from husband Cash Warren, seeing as Alba officially filed just weeks ago, on February 7, 2025. In the past, you might have seen some of Alba's tattoos on the red carpet. Their placements make it easy to catch glimpses of them, but the beauty entrepreneur has revealed that she also has tattoos that are usually covered by clothes. In addition to Alba's latest piece, she has six other pieces of ink we know of. In 2019, Alba got three tattoos on her forearm in honor of her three children. She shared photos of the ink on Instagram, showing off the three different astrological constellations representing her children's zodiac signs. In a 2019 interview with Refinery29, Alba shared that she regrets one or two of her designs. The first being a bow that is located in the middle of her lower back, and the second is a flower design she has on the back of her neck, which she says she's tried removing. \"I got it when I was, like, 17 and I'm so irritated that I got it,\" she says. \"I got it lasered many times and it's not coming out.\" If you're looking to check out all of Alba's pieces, we've got you covered. From her latest addition to the ink she's tried lasering off, keep reading for everything we know about Alba's tattoos.",
