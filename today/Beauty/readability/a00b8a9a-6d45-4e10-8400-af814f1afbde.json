  "description": "If you don't know Glen \"Coco\" Oropeza by name just yet, you will absolutely recognize his work. The beauty pro has worked with some of the biggest celebrities the business. We're talking Emma Watson, Ariana Greenblatt, Nicola Pelts Beckham, and, of course, Sydney Sweeney. When we sat down with him to chat about all things hair, the first order of business actually had nothing to do with beauty. We needed to address the lore behind Oropeza's Instagram handle, @glencocoforhair. If you thought it was a nod to the 2004 movie \"Mean Girls,\" you'd be right. \"My friends dubbed me that nickname back whenever that movie came out,\" Oropeza tells PS. \"It became my nickname and now it's just my hair alter ego.\" In \"Mean Girls,\" the character Glen Coco is applauded for getting a bunch of candy grams, therefore deigning him popular. Oropeza is the Glen Coco for hair, probably because he's really, really good at it. (I mean, does Sweeney's hair ever look bad?) After chatting about what to expect for fall (bobs are still very much in, just in case you were wondering), Oropeza broke down some of his favorite hair tips - including the ones responsible for keeping his clients' hair in tip-top shape. Keep scrolling to check them all out. Experts Featured in This Article Glen Oropeza is a celebrity hairstylist based in Los Angeles. He works with celebrities like Sydney Sweeney and Emma Watson. He is a brand ambassador for Kérastase. Tip 1: Don't Skip the Hair Oil You need a good hair oil in your routine. Specifically, grab yourself a bottle of the Kérastase Elixir Ultime Refillable Hydrating Hair Oil ($62). \"I'm always trying to condense my kit, so I'm always looking to replace it with something that can do multiple things,\" Oropeza says. \"You can use [this hair oil] to prep a blow dry, you can use it after a blow dry, you can use it as a treatment, you can use it to get out, build-up of product. There's just so many uses for it. So that's always going to be my go-to especially when my girls are traveling.\" If you've never used hair oil to remove product buildup before, Oropeza says it works great if you've got a bunch of hairspray in your hair; you can douse a generous amount on your head to help break down the product prior to shampooing. \"It helps so when you're under the showerm you're not breaking your hair while trying to get through all that hairspray.\" If you're still a little shy when it comes to hair oil because you have thin or fine hair, Oropeza's tip is to start with less and not too high on the head. Instead, stick to the mid-lengths and ends. Tip 2: Sleep With a Silk Bonnet \"Everyone should be sleeping with a silk bonnet,\" Oropeza says. \"Silk pillowcases were trendy for a moment, but we roll around so much, it's better for your hair to be secure and out of the way.\" Not sure if a silk bonnet is right for you? According to Oropeza, they're basically the right move for any hair type. \"If you're prone to breakage, you have blond hair, color damage, or any damage at all, you should be sleeping with some sort of silk bonnet.\" Tip 3: Always Prep For Wash Day Wash day can be a pain, but Oropeza says you should actually prep your hair prior to jumping in the shower. \"I recommend hair oiling the night before a wash day. Just lube it up with some oil, put it in a little braid, put your silk bonnet on, and it'll lead to a really shiny wash day.\" Additionally, he recommends doing a pre-wash scalp treatment before you get in the shower. We like the Briogeo Scalp Revival Rosemary Pre-Wash ($32). From there, he says you should use scalp scrub in the shower prior to shampooing your hair, then go in with your regular shampoo and conditioner. View this post on Instagram A post shared by G L E N “COCO” O R O P E Z A (@glencocoforhair) Tip 4: Air Dry Whenever Possible Post shower, if you're looking to maintain the health and integrity of your hair, air dry as often as possible. \"I think it's healthier for your hair and you're going to get longevity the same way you would if you got a blow dry,\" Oropeza says. However, he knows it isn't for everyone. \"Let's say you have a wavy curl pattern and you can't stand it being air-dried, then it's obviously not going to be for you.\" However, if you're interested in trying to work it into your routine more often, there are plenty of air drying techniques that are worth looking into, especially if you have color-treated or extremely blond hair. If you do decide to air dry, there's one product that you need. \"It's all about finding the right leave-in conditioner for you,\" Oropeza adds. \"Something that's light and not too heavy.\" Our current favorite is the Unite 7Seconds Leave-In Conditioner ($38). Tip 5: Buy A Bigger Curling Iron We know there are plenty of us who are obsessed with our 1.25-inch curling irons, but Oropeza says the key to most of his clients' looks is actually a much bigger hair tool. \"I love a 2-inch iron. It gives you a blowout effect without your hair looking overly styled and overly curly.\" If you have shorter hair, however, Oropeza suggests opting for a 1.5-inch curling iron. Our current favorite is the T3 SinglePass Curl 1.5 Ceramic ($150). Once you've got the right tool, getting a chic look like Sweeney's is a breeze. \"I know the age-old technique is to curl away from the face, but I'm not really into that,\" he says. \"I always curl toward the face except for your face-framing bang. Even if you look [at] my last 20 hairstyles, it's almost always curled toward the face or I'm alternating.\" To get the exact look that Sweeney is sporting above, Oropeza says he alternated horizontally. \"I curled one section forward, one section back, and then that little face framing I curl away.\" To seal the deal, he always uses a texture spray and then follows it up with a hair oil. \"It doesn't look frizzy, but it looks separated and piecey - that's what hair oil does.\" Renee Rodriguez is a staff writer and social producer for PS.
