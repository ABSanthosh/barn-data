Either way, if you're looking for body art that represents you, we've rounded up some of the most beautiful and motivational quote tattoo ideas that will change your point of view for the better. Good tattoo phrases are everywhere, you just have to know where to look. From tattoo quotes about strength to small quote tattoos, we've rounded up the best tattoo quotes, which feature a little something for everyone. Keep scrolling to see them all.\"Whatever You Are\" Quote TattooThis script quote tattoo placed in the center of someone's back reads, \"Whatever you are, be a good one.\" A reminder to the best version of you — no matter how you choose to define yourself.\"Slow Down Your Thoughts\" Quote TatooInspirational tattoo quotes often feature words that serve as a reminder. This example, which says \"slow down your thoughts,\" is a great little nudge to take a breath and slow things down. The font is simple and pared down, and we love the surrounding artwork. \"I Am Enough\" Quote TattooPositive affirmations can be hugely motivating, and what better way to constantly affirm something than with a permanent reminder on your body? This \"I Am Enough\" piece is a great option if you're looking for short tattoo quotes. The flower is a nice touch as well. \"Sh*t Happens\" Quote TattooQuote tattoos don't need to be serious; they can be funny, like this \"sh*t happens\" piece located on the lower bicep. The fact that it shows a scratched-out image before writing \"sh*t happens\" just goes to show that mistakes will be made, but it's how you react to them that matters. \"Be Brave\" Quote TattooThis simple, short quote tattoo located on the lower bicep/upper forearm needs no further explanation. You can opt to get it in any font or size, but this one is on the larger side. \"What Matters Most\" Quote TattooLong quote tattoos work particularly well running down the spine, like this one that reads, \"What matters most is how well you walk through life.\" You can opt for a thick, bold script, like this example, or go for something thinner. \"Handle With Care\" Quote TattooThe tiny, delicate typewriter font used for this quote tattoo located on the bicep makes it feel more personal yet still chic. The precise location means it can easily be hidden underneath a short-sleeved shirt, or you can show it off with a tank top. \"Vulnerability Is Not Weakness\" Quote TattooThe top of the foot is a unique spot for your ink, and we think this quote tattoo that reads \"vulnerability is not weakness\" is a great daily reminder. Plus, the words facing outward will remind everyone who sees them, not just you. \"Baby You Are Magic\" Quote TattooThis ink is a constant reminder of self-love, and reads, \"baby you are magic,\" which is a great inspirational tattoo quote. The red ink adds a little something different that you don't see too often. \"Keep Searching, Keep Growing\" Quote TatooIf you want to keep your ink hidden, the side of the hip is a great spot for a long tattoo quote. You can opt for one long line, or you can break it up into two different quotes. \"Strength\" Quote TattooThis tattoo quote about strength reads \"strength is what we gain from the madness we survive,\" paired with a butterfly. It signals transformation and growth.\"After All This Time\" Quote TattooThis tattoo reads, \"After all this time?\" followed by a skeleton hand and a human hand touching fingers, ending with the word \"Always.\" This is a quote from \"Harry Potter\" where Snape is talking about loving Lily, Harry's mother. This quote can be applied to many things, but we love when it expresses an everlasting love. \"Yes, I'm Changing\" Quote TattooChange doesn't always have to be a bad thing. In fact, it can actually be great, especially if you're growing as a person. This quote tattoo serves as a statement that you're changing, and it's for the better.\"Be Yourself\" Quote TattooLive authentically with this quote as a daily reminder that you should be the only person you're trying to impress. We like the mix of two different fonts, one in cursive and one in all capital letters. \"Silver Lining\" Quote TattooThe collarbone is an unconventional yet genius spot for a small quote tattoo. It makes the perfect accessory, especially if you're wearing a strapless top. This design reads \"silver lining.\" \"I Am Enough\" Quote TattooYou'll always remember your worth with this meaningful tattoo quote that reads \"I am enough.\" It's inked in a pretty cursive script that's all lowercase, but you can choose whatever style you like. \"Positive Mental Attitude\" Quote TattooYour inspirational tattoo quote will look especially pretty running along your ribcage, but the actual words are what we love the most: \"positive mental attitude.\" Let this tattoo serve as a daily reminder to always think positive. \"Know Your Worth\" Quote TattooThis tattoo quote about strength reads \"know your worth\" and serves as a constant reminder to practice a bit of extra self-love. It's a small quote tattoo, but it packs a big punch. \"Rain Will Make the Flowers Grow\" Quote TattooThis quote tattoo reads \"rain will make the flowers grow,\" which is a reminder that something good will come out of even your darkest days. This one is located on the upper thigh in a typewriter font, but you can choose to stylize it however you want. \"If You Want to Fly\" Quote TattooA long quote tattoo works great on the upper thigh, as you have a bit of extra space to work with. This one reads, \"If you want to fly, give up everything that weighs you down.\" \"God Is a Woman\" Quote TattooWhether you're an Ariana Grande fan or this is just your personal belief, this small quote tattoo speaks for itself. It's placed on the hip, and it can be easily hidden beneath pants. We also love the double font. \"Aquí y Ahora\" Quote TattooThis quote tattoo is in Spanish and translates to \"here and now,\" which serves as a reminder to be present. The quote is actually facing upward, so the person whose arm it's on can read it easily. \"See the Good\" Quote TattooThis \"see the good\" quote tattoo is a nice little reminder to yourself to contemplate the lens with which you look at the world. It's placed on the ribcage so it can be easily hidden or shown off in a cute crop top or swimsuit. \"No Matter\" Quote TattooIf you want to get a matching quote tattoo with a friend or family member, there are plenty of different options, but this quote is especially great. One reads \"no matter where,\" and the other reads \"no matter what,\" in a fun cursive script. \"Be the Child You Were\" Quote TattooThis meaningful quote tattoo is on the inner bicep and reads: \"be the child you were.\" It's written in a medium cursive script in all lowercase. \"Wild One\" Quote TattooThis flirty phrase — \"wild one\" — makes for a great quote tattoo, and the location on the top of the thigh makes it even sexier. You can keep it a secret, or show it off with some short shorts or a bikini. \"Why Not?\" Quote TattooThis two-word phrase, \"why not,\" is a simple matching quote tattoo idea that can fit anywhere on the body. You can get it with a loved one like a friend or a sibling. \"Don't Just Exist, Live\" Quote TattooThe pretty font used for this quote tattoo really elevates the quote, which reads, \"don't just exist, live.\" It's located on the forearm, but would also look great placed anywhere on the body. \"Trust the Process\" Quote TattooThis small quote tattoo is simple yet classic and reads \"trust the process.\" It's perfect if you need a timeless design, which is accomplished with the typewriter font. \"Wish You Were Here\" Quote TattooIf you want to dedicate a quote tattoo to a loved one, consider this \"wish you were here\" design, like this one located on the arm. Whether you love the Pink Floyd song or you just want a meaningful quote tattoo, this is one of our top picks.\"I Love You\" Quote TattooThe quote \"I love you to the moon and back\" is quite popular, but it makes a stunning quote tattoo. This example has a tiny moon and stars accenting either end. This small quote tattoo is perfect if you're looking to commemorate a loved one and how much they mean to you. \"Always and Forever\" Quote TattooWhether you want a reminder that your love for someone is always and forever, or you just want a daily self-love reminder, we love this tiny quote tattoo. It's in a fun script, and you could even get it tattooed in the handwriting of the loved one it's dedicated to. \"Your Now\" Quote TattooIf you need a daily reminder that when things aren't going your way, your circumstances aren't permanent, consider this quote tattoo that reads, \"Your now is not your forever.\" Things will always get better. \"Everything Happens For a Reason\" Quote TattooThis small type quote tattoo reads \"everything happens for a reason,\" and serves as a reminder that nothing is by chance. This one is punctuated with the outline of a butterfly, which we love. Haley Lyndes is a shopping writer and editor with more than seven years of experience in the publishing space.
