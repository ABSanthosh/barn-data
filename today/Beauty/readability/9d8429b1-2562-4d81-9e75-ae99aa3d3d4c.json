  "description": "When it comes to beauty routines, I give the most attention to my hair. My hair type is fine and frizzy, and ever since I got highlights, it's been a bit of a dry, tangled mess. In an effort to get it back to where it was prior to being color treated (soft and impossibly shiny), I've been testing out different shampoo and conditioner combinations. I'm in the process of swapping my apartment's shower head to something filtered, and I also rotate through different hair masks weekly. When I heard about the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask ($36), I was confused. A dry hair mask? The only masks I had ever tried before were . . . well, wet, and they needed to be washed out after application. This one said it didn't need a rinse, and the before-and-after photos looked great, but I was skeptical and thought the whole thing sounded too good to be true. Spoiler alert: it wasn't. Keep scrolling to read my full review of the IGK Leave-In Dry Hair Mask and find out why I can no longer live without it. About the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask This product is a dry overnight hair treatment mask, so you don't need to wash or restyle your hair after use. It's safe for all hair types, as well as color and chemically treated hair. It's made with bond-building technology to repair hair, as well as vegan silk proteins to soften and smooth hair. It comes in a 5oz bottle as well as a 1.7oz travel size. It's free of sulfates, parabens, and phthalates. It's vegan, cruelty-free, and gluten-free. The packaging is also recyclable. What I Like About the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask The first time I tested it out, I had no idea what to expect. I had never tried a \"dry\" hair mask before, so I wasn't sure if it would work or if I would notice a difference. I followed the instructions exactly and applied it on dry hair right before bed. I'm used to waking up with tons of tangles and knots (even when I sleep on a silk pillowcase), but I woke up the next morning with hair that felt soft, silky, and smooth to the touch. Since then, I've been using it twice a week in between washes. I have a lot of frizz, especially at my roots, and whenever I use this product, I notice fewer flyaways and more shine. It doesn't weigh my hair down, and if I weren't physically watching myself spraying it onto my hair (and then seeing the results later), I wouldn't believe there was any product on my hair at all. Although I have a few masks I typically keep in heavy rotation, I have to wash them out, and I can't go about my day when wearing them unless I opt for a slicked-back bun. This product makes doing a hair mask so much easier and more convenient because I don't have to wash it out; it makes my hair more manageable with just a few sprays, and it also smells amazing. How to Use the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask The brand recommends shaking the can and then applying the product to dry hair in sections before going to bed. They suggest spraying as evenly as possible while holding the can 10 to 12 inches away from your hair. Then, brush everything through. When you wake up in the morning, comb through your hair again - but no need to wash it. I use this mask in two ways. I either follow those directions exactly - using it before bed - or I spray it on my hair during the day, when it's looking a little dry and is in obvious need of some TLC. I've found that when I section my hair out prior to application, I get the best results. But occasionally, if I'm in a rush or feeling lazy, I spritz it all over my hair while it's down and brush it through, then continue on with my day, and I genuinely notice a difference just minutes after applying. What to Consider Before Trying the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask I can't think of a single thing I don't like about this product; it's become a staple in my weekly routine. It even comes in a travel size - which I need to purchase ASAP - so you can make sure you bring soft and silky hair with you wherever you go. Where the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask Is Available The IGK Antisocial Bond-Building Leave-In Dry Hair Mask is available directly on IGK as well as Sephora, Ulta, and Amazon. Rating:",

I either follow those directions exactly — using it before bed — or I spray it on my hair during the day, when it\u0026#39;s looking a little dry and is in obvious need of some TLC. I\u0026#39;ve found that when I section my hair out prior to application, I get the best results. But occasionally, if I\u0026#39;m in a rush or feeling lazy, I spritz it all over my hair while it\u0026#39;s down and brush it through, then continue on with my day, and I genuinely notice a difference just minutes after applying.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat to Consider Before Trying the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask \u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\"\u003eI can\u0026#39;t think of a single thing I don\u0026#39;t like about this product; it\u0026#39;s become a staple in my weekly routine.
