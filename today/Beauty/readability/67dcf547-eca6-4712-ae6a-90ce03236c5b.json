  "description": "Halloween may still be a few weeks away, but Bath \u0026 Body Works is ready to drop its highly anticipated Halloween collection. Just like last year, the 70-plus-piece collection is filled with spooky candles, lotions, hand soaps, accessories, and more. The collection became available in stores and online starting July 23, 2024, the Bath \u0026 Body Works Halloween 2024 collection is gearing up to be one of the brand's best yet.. The fan-favorite scents of Vampire Blood (which smells of red berries, jasmine, and plum), and Purrfect Pumpkin (with notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, and vanilla), will be joined by three all-new fragrances called Immortal, Spooky Moontini, and Candy Apple Cauldron. Immortal smells of black plum, woods, and saffron; Spooky Moontini has notes of berries, sugar, and citrus; and Candy Apple Cauldron smells of sour green apple, sugar, and bergamot - all captivating in their own way. \"At Bath \u0026 Body Works, we've always believed you can never be too early or too much when it comes to celebrating a holiday,\" Betsy Schumacher, the brand's chief merchandising officer, tells PS. \"This year marks our biggest Halloween assortment to date with over 75 products.\" There's plenty more where that comes from, like wicked decor and accessories including a friendly ghost-shaped candle holder, haunted-house-themed wall plug-in, pumpkin-embellished soap holders, and much, much more. And if you were a fan of the viral witch-hand candle holder from 2021, know the brand has released similar items for you to shop this year. \"Our 2024 Halloween Collection was inspired by the trend of over-the-top costuming – glitz, glam, galas, and grandiosity,\" says Schumacher. \"Customers can truly immerse all their senses in the season with innovative accessories that feature glowing lights, color-changing projectors, and even eerie sounds.\" If you're planning to stock up on these festive items, we highly recommend signing up for Bath \u0026 Body Works's new loyalty program so you can start collecting points ASAP. Take a look at all the products, and get ready to shop the Bath \u0026 Body Works Halloween collection 2024 before they're gone for good.",
