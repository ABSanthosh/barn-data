I love trying new skincare but to keep my list edited I’m focusing on my tried and true staples, ie products I repurchase over and over again. Dates and details below, use code SAVINGS if shopping online! (some exclusions apply): Rouge members 20% off: 11/1 – 11/11 VIBs 15% off: 11/5 – 11/11 Insiders 10% off: 11/5 – 11/11 All Sephora Collection 30% off: 11/1 – 11/11 Makeup Removers and Cleansers For removing makeup double cleansing is still a must to effectively remove all traces of makeup or sunscreen. I love a good cleansing oil but my favorite isn’t sold at Sephora (it’s this one from Chanel). I do have several solid balm makeup removers I love which I’ll list below. Farmacy Green Clean is one of the best makeup remover balms. I love the classic one and this is the one I always keep stocked at home, but their limited-edition scented ones are always so fun for me to try. Elemis and Clinique also make great solid cleansing balms, but I feel like the Farmacy one is the best and most effective. Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cleanser is the best everyday cleanser for me and Andrew. After trying dozens of cleansers over the years I have to say this has the best consistency to clean the skin without drying it. Serums and Moisturizers I’ve been neglecting essence treatments this year but I think I need to start using one again since they really make a difference! I just repurchased the La Mer Treatment Lotion for the sale. For serums my 3 go-to’s include the Drunk Elephant B-Hydra (great for year round), Caudalie Vinoperfect Brightening Dark Spot Serum (for brightening) and La Mer The Concentrate Serum (best splurge). I have several favorites for moisturizing creams. My top 5 are the La Mer Moisturizing Soft Cream, Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream, Augustinus Bader The Cream, Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide Firming Moisturizer and the Bobbi Brown Vitamin Enriched Face Base. I would rank the La Mer and Charlotte Tilbury in my top 2 right now. Those are the two formulas I packed with me in October. While La Mer is quite the splurge, I do think it has been worth it for me. I have repurchased the Moisturizing Soft Cream multiple times and also bought one to gift to my sister-in-law for Mother’s Day and she loves it. With any of these formulas I highly recommend checking out a travel set or value set to try first. I always find it helpful to try something in a smaller size to sample before committing to the full size. Some great options: Drunk Elephant The Littles Set or Resort to This Day Kit Charlotte Tilbury Iconic Magic Mini Set (magic cream is also available in a mini individually) Augustinus Bader On the Go Moisturizer Set (has both The Rich Cream and The Cream to try, I’ve tried both and both are excellent) Caudalie Dark Spot Brightening Serum + Sunscreen Set Several of you asked me if I use retinol or tretinoin – I do not. I have really loved the Kiehl’s Micro-Dose Retinol Serum in the past but haven’t repurchased in a while. Right now I’ve been loving La Mer’s new Rejuvenating Night Cream. I’ve been using this for several months now and every other night (it is suitable to use nightly though) and I 10/10 love it. Eye Treatments I have a few eye treatments I love from Sephora. The La Mer Eye Concentrate Cream is my go-to right now. It has the best consistency and texture for me – not too thick and not too thin. It helps with fine lines and hydration. I’ve also been very impressed with Caudalie’s Resveratrol-Lift, Premiere Cru and the Vinoperfect Dark Circle Brightening Eye Cream. I’ve repurchased the brightening one and will probably repurchase the Resveratrol-Lift before the sale ends. Face Masks and Treatments I have used pore clearing and detox masks the most this year out of any face mask or treatment. I have three I think are 100% worth checking out. Innisfree Super Volcanic AHA Pore Clearing Clay Mask is one of the most gentle pore masks I’ve tried and I’m obsessed. Caudalie Pore Minimizing Instant Detox Mask is also excellent but it’s on the stronger side (absorbs a LOT of excess oil). A few readers recommended the La Mer Deep Purifying Mask to me earlier this year. I decided to give it a try and it 10/10 lives up to the hype from you! It is quite the splurge and currently sold out online but you can always add the notification restock alert to your account if you’re interested. For the best sheet mask I still swear by the La Mer Treatment Lotion Hydrating Sheet Masks but it costs an arm and leg. Lip Balms I am a lip-balm junkie. I love trying different formulas! I could go on and on about ones I’ve loved, but the three I’ve used up and repurchased are Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm (this mini set is so cute), Laneige Glowy Lip Balm (love this cute set too) and the La Mer Lip Volumizer (love the clear one, but the tinted ones are also fun). Swatches of the Summer Fridays ones below: Sunscreen My top three sunscreens right now are the Caudalie Vinosun Protect SPF 50, Charlotte Tilbury Invisible UV Flawless Primer SPF 50 and Shiseido Ultimate Sun Protector Lotion SPF 60. I also really like a lot of formulas from Supergoop! but right now those three listed above are what I have been using lately. Body Care I love trying different body washes and shower creams. I don’t have any loyalty to a particular formula or brand as I love trying new ones all the time. I will say I gravitate towards ones that can be unisex or have that clean smell because Andrew likes to use them too. Our top three most repurchased formulas are the Ouai Dean Street Body Wash, Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Play Body Wash and Jack Black Turbo Wash. I will say that for winter the turbo wash is a little too drying so we’ve switched it out for the Necessaire Body Wash in Santal (love this Body Wash Discovery Set they’ve launched this year). For a shower oil Andrew loves the L’occitane Almond Shower Oil. We used to love the Shea Shower Cream but they changed the formula/scent recently and it has an unflattering floral scent to it now. If you struggle with body acne (we sometimes do in the hot summer months) we recommend the Kosasport Good Body Skin AHA Enzyme Exfoliating Body Wash. Two body creams I really love are the Herbivore Botanicals Cloud Milk Coconut Body Cream and Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream. As a huge fan of Phlur Missing Person’s scent I also really love the Missing Person Body Oil (although I think Osea and Chanel make the best body oils, unfortunately they aren’t at Sephora). That wraps up my current skincare and body care favorites! I know finding the best skincare can be overwhelming as it really takes time to try and see if something works for your skin type or needs. I really wish there was 1 single brand I could use all of my skincare from. If I had to pick just one I think Drunk Elephant has the best variety and range. If you’re looking for recommendations I hope you found this post helpful!",

I don’t have any loyalty to a particular formula or brand as I love trying new ones all the time. I will say I gravitate towards ones that can be unisex or have that clean smell because Andrew likes to use them too. Our top three most repurchased formulas are the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/37VpNEi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eOuai Dean Street Body Wash\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/32kdDhK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eSol de Janeiro Brazilian Play Body Wash\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/2HL9lLW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eJack Black Turbo Wash\u003c/a\u003e. I will say that for winter the turbo wash is a little too drying so we’ve switched it out for the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/4eZcMZw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eNecessaire Body Wash in Santal\u003c/a\u003e (love this \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/4fvqioB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eBody Wash Discovery Set\u003c/a\u003e they’ve launched this year).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a shower oil Andrew loves the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/4hFaIba\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eL’occitane Almond Shower Oil\u003c/a\u003e. We used to love the Shea Shower Cream but they changed the formula/scent recently and it has an unflattering floral scent to it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you struggle with body acne (we sometimes do in the hot summer months) we recommend the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/492gTlk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eKosasport Good Body Skin AHA Enzyme Exfoliating Body Wash\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo body creams I really love are the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3Q5uboA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eHerbivore Botanicals Cloud Milk Coconut Body Cream\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/4fBCHXr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eCharlotte Tilbury Magic Cream\u003c/a\u003e.

I know finding the best skincare can be overwhelming as it really takes time to try and see if something works for your skin type or needs. I really wish there was 1 single brand I could use all of my skincare from. If I had to pick just one I think Drunk Elephant has the best variety and range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re looking for recommendations I hope you found this post helpful!\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
