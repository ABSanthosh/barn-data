    "description": "If there’s one thing OPI knows, it’s how to nail a trend — literally. Whenever we stumble across a viral nail polish video on TikTok, nine times out of 10 it’s an OPI shade swatch. We still remember when our feeds were taken over by one viral Hailey Bieber manicure after another, from vanilla chrome nails (that’s OPI in the shade Funny Bunny, in case you’re wondering) to the more Y2K-inspired digital lavender.OPI has always been ahead of the curve, even before the days of social media. OPI cofounder Suzi Weiss-Fischmann is the mastermind behind various tongue-in-cheek names that made many of its offerings instant classics, like I'm Not Really a Waitress and Don't Bossa Nova Me Around. And let’s not forget fan favorites like Big Apple Red or Lincoln Park After Dark, which have been trademarked due to their universal popularity.We’ve tapped Lia Smith, OPI’s brand education manager, to help us pick out a list of bestselling shades the internet just can’t get enough of. Browse ahead for colors that will inspire your 2025 polish refresh.All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.For more can't-miss shopping stories delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our Most Wanted newsletter.Funny BunnyIt’s not surprising that Funny Bunny has a spot on this list, given its heavy celebrity endorsement. This white shade formed the backbone of Hailey Bieber’s vanilla chrome manicure, and Sofia Richie Grange also famously wore it to her wedding rehearsal dinner. It’s a lovely sheer cream that turns milky white when you pile on a second coat.Shop UltaOPI Infinite Shine Funny Bunny, $, available at UltaGot The Blues For Red“Rich wine tones are having a moment,” says Smith. “We’ve been seeing a lot of shades that evoke mellow red wine and sumptuous burgundy reds.” Case in point: this TikTok on Got The Blues For Red, a cool-toned dark red, that has received over 330K likes. It’s the kind of jewel tone that we want to peeking from our sweater sleeves as soon as there’s a hint of chill in the air.Shop UltaOPI Got The Blues For Red, $, available at UltaNot Afraid Of The DarkCall it the Espresso effect, but we’re all about brown nail colors lately.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. The skincare industry never sleeps. At the cutting edge of beauty science and innovation, new launches and smart technologies arrive at breakneck speed, with even celebrities getting in on the action. And it’s in no danger of slowing down, especially now that thanks to Reddit and TikTok, more of us are skincare-savvy and know our retinoids from our exosomes. As such, brands have less license to fob us off with marketing spiel. We’re keen to understand the hard science behind each and every ingredient — but being tuned in doesn’t mean we’re averse to buzzy trends. From LED devices to holistic facials, here are eight skincare movements to watch out for in 2025, according to the experts. Biotech boffinry One thing that brands like Reome, Bioeffect and K18 have in common is that their skin and hair care feature lab-grown ingredients — a process known as biotechnology. Not only is this more sustainable than harvesting natural ingredients the traditional way (the “naturals versus synthetics” debate is now far less black and white) but it could be better for your skin, too. Reome’s Active Recovery Broth, $141, uses bio-ferments: ingredients taken from natural materials that then go through a fermentation process. This means that the serum works like a probiotic, treating inflammation and keeping the skin barrier healthy and happy. The Ordinary’s Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate Solution 20% in Vitamin F, $20.50, boasts lab-made ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate, an oil-based form of brightening vitamin C that’s absorbed more easily and doesn’t irritate the skin compared to other forms of vitamin C. You heard it here first: Biotechnology is the future of skincare. Wellness-based, doctor-led brands As opposed to the many clinical, doctor-led brands on the market, there’s a growing shift towards wellness-driven skincare. This takes its cue from the psychodermatology movement, which highlights the close connection between mental health and skin health. “Given the strong link between the mind and the skin, many of us are also practicing mindful [skincare], where the ritual of applying products is linked to a sensory experience such as aromatherapy or massage for maximum relaxation,” notes consultant dermatologist Dr. Jonathan Kentley. An early adopter in this space is consultant dermatologist Dr. Alexis Granite, who recently launched skincare range Joonbyrd, a brand with mood-boosting scents like cashmere, musk and jasmine. While effective and cheaper than visiting a dermatologist, doctor-led brands aren’t the most affordable option for everyone. The next best thing we’ve found is Bubble Skincare, which boasts similarly bright, playful packaging and purse-friendly, science-backed formulas. The “anti-injectables” era  “Pillow face” is a term that gained traction on TikTok after a handful of viral videos, including one from creator Layla K. Saleh, claimed that fillers never fully dissolve. Another video by Rochel Leah highlighted celebrities who had seemingly overdone the filler, resulting in a puffy appearance. This has made us rethink the future of fillers, not to mention questionable trends like preventative Botox. Lots of experts are leaning towards traditional holistic methods and at-home devices such as ZIIP Halo, $399, for a more refreshed yet natural look. Facial acupuncture is one such skincare treatment seeing a resurgence. Used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for centuries, it’s a minimally invasive treatment that involves inserting fine needles into specific points on the face in a bid to improve circulation, stimulate collagen production and deliver a more youthful glow. A handful of studies suggest it has skin-rejuvenating properties, too. “There’s definitely a higher demand for facial acupuncture,” says practitioner Ka Hang Leoungk. “What’s interesting is the growing popularity among men and younger demographics, who are now using it as a preventative measure — quite a change from 10 years ago when it was mainly an older group seeking facial acupuncture for fine lines, wrinkles and toning.” As well as acupuncture, there seems to be a growing trend for other holistic facial treatments. Yakov Gershkovich is a big name in this space thanks to his Sculptural Face Lifting (SFL) method. It’s a facial technique that goes beyond muscle tension, using targeted hand movements to release “emotional blockages”, sometimes causing clients to laugh or cry. The results, he claims, aren’t just about improving the skin’s appearance — they’re also about feeling lighter and more energetically balanced.  Introducing exosomes Regenerative exosome-based treatments that adopt a more natural-looking approach to skin rejuvenation are going to be everywhere next year. Dr. Colette Haydon, dermopharmacist and founder of Lixirskin, explains that exosomes are tiny particles extracted from cells — specifically plant cells in skincare. These act like microscopic messengers to deliver information to other cells, instructing them to regenerate. It’s a trend that aesthetician Dr. Ivy Igerc predicts will impact the wider skincare space. “As an expert in regenerative medicine, I can confidently say that exosomes are the closest we can get to achieving real regeneration of human cells and tissues. They are based on DNA activation to stimulate collagen production,” she says.  Gadgets are going nowhere “[In 2025], we may see more advancements in at-home devices that offer professional-level results without the need to visit a clinic, such as light devices and easy-to-use at-home gadgets,” says Beverly Hills aesthetician Dr. Simon Ourian. Some at-home tech is even being touted as an alternative to injectables and tweakments. Brands getting a slice of the action include Shark, whose LED mask is available for £269.99. Oculoplastic reconstructive surgeon Dr. Sabrina Shah recently launched an LED mask, $321, specifically for the eye area, comprising two small masks that resemble under-eye patches. They stay on using gentle adhesive stickers that don’t block the light waves. AI-driven diagnostics With dermatologist appointments becoming more expensive and difficult to access, ChatGPT has proven to be an unexpected skincare guru. While it’s not recommended to rely on AI for serious skin conditions such as rosacea or cystic acne, there’s definitely a place for it in our general routines. Many websites like Dr. Ourian’s now offer a virtual skincare analysis where patients can answer a series of questions before being emailed a personalized list of products. Dr. Ourian tells R29 that he has noticed a shift towards skincare routines based on AI recommendations, with products and procedures tailored to individual skin types and concerns. Earlier this year, Sephora revealed its plans to roll out Smart Skin Scan, a new skin diagnostic aimed at offering even more personalized recommendations. Dr. Kentley welcomes the rise of AI tools to help make at-home routines simpler and safer. “As a dermatologist we frequently see patients come with a carrier bag full of serums, often making their skin worse,” he notes. “As we enter 2025, ‘skinimalism’ will continue to grow, focusing on simple and efficient routines. Artificial intelligence is likely to play an important role in driving personalization by tailoring routines to individual needs, taking into account medical history, skin tone and lifestyle factors.” Pigmentation power players As Google queries for pigmentation continue to increase, Lookfantastic named it the third most-searched term on its site, while award-winning aesthetician Dija Ayodele’s Black Skin Directory — a platform designed to connect people with darker skin tones to skincare professionals — identified pigmentation as its top search. Happily, a host of super ingredients have emerged to address this issue. Take malassezin, for example. “Malassezin, a natural molecule derived from the malassezia furfur fungus, has emerged as a powerful ingredient for tackling pigmentation issues like melasma and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation,” explains Dr. Munir Somji. “It’s reported to be 10 times more effective than vitamin C in reducing dark spots and [evening] skin tone with a three-pronged action: decreasing melanin production [the natural substance that gives skin its pigment], limiting melanin transfer and reducing its movement to the skin’s surface.”  Malassezin is relatively new in skincare and not many brands are using it yet. In the meantime, try La Roche-Posay’s MelaB3 Serum, $44.99, with melasyl, which the brand refers to as a “melanin trapper”. Paula’s Choice Triple Active Total Repair Serum, $49, uses other key ingredients to work on dark spots, most notably hexylresorcinol. “Hexylresorcinol is a real powerhouse when it comes to tackling pigmentation,” notes Abi Cleeve, managing director at Ultrasun. “It’s a ‘one and done’ solution that doesn’t skimp on UV filters or other skincare actives, giving you great results.” Post-ink aftercare In 2023, the global tattoo market was valued at $2.03 billion and is expected to grow to $4.83 billion by 2032. “Tattoos have become a mainstream fixture and proper aftercare — such as moisturizer and sun protection — is key to keeping your ink looking fresh,” notes Beauty Matter editor Carla Seipp. Barker Wellness Co., created by Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker, is a new line of cannabinoid-infused skincare including a Tattoo Aftercare Duo, a balm and cream with ingredients such as soothing helichrysum oil and redness-reducing bisabolol to protect the skin barrier during the healing process. Some brands are even repurposing existing products as tattoo aftercare: Dr. Bronner’s recently promoted its Organic Lip Balm, $3.99, as a versatile option for tattoo care. Whatever your budget, it certainly beats slathering on the petroleum jelly. Like what you see?

    "description": "It's safe to say that I've tested my fair share of beauty products. As someone who writes about different hacks, trends, and products on a daily basis, it comes with the territory. I'm usually more than happy to try out makeup and hair care, but when it comes to skin care, things get a little dicey. I have dry, acne-prone skin, and it's also reactive. If my face or body doesn't like something, it'll tell me within a few minutes of slathering it on - usually in the form of an angry red rash or something equally as jarring. The good news? Once I wash whatever product I've been testing off, the rash goes away, but it's still a little scary to experience in the moment. For this reason, I usually stick with products like moisturizers, sunscreens, and cleansers for years after I've found one I like. So, you can bet that if I move a new product into my everyday rotation, it's for a good reason. The latest addition to my routine? The Cocokind Electrolyte Water Cream ($20). Keep scrolling to read my full review of the product and find out why it's landed a permanent spot in my medicine cabinet. About the Cocokind Electrolyte Water Cream This product is a lightweight moisturizer made for morning and nighttime use. It's best for acne-prone, combination, or oily skin. However, it's suitable for all skin types. The key ingredients include magnesium PCA and sodium PCA to hydrate and offer barrier protection, as well as zinc PCA to help calm skin. It's fragrance-free, cruelty-free, and vegan. What I Like About the Cocokind Electrolyte Water Cream I've been testing this moisturizer for almost a month, and I'm happy to say that, for starters, it didn't break me out or cause any irritation. On top of that, it goes on silky smooth, it isn't sticky, and it's great at calming redness (especially after a night of picking at my zits). I find that it's great to wear under makeup, and I haven't noticed any issues with pilling or weird patchy areas when layering foundation on top. Also, the packaging definitely needs an honorable mention. There's nothing I hate more than a moisturizer that comes in a tub because it requires me to dip my fingers into it, thereby spreading germs all over the place. This moisturizer comes in a pump form, which makes it super easy to dispense directly onto my fingers and then rub onto my face. I also like that it's fragrance-free, because occasionally my skin reacts poorly to fragranced products. How to Use the Cocokind Electrolyte Water Cream The brand recommends using this moisturizer in the morning or at night and massaging it into clean skin. I like to use this product in two ways. The first is in the morning after cleansing and patting my skin dry. I typically will apply a few serums, let them dry down, and then layer on this moisturizer. I then follow with sunscreen and makeup. I've found that this product is a little light for overnight use, especially on my dry skin, but I do like using it after I've picked at my skin. (I know, I know - I shouldn't be picking at my skin regardless, but there are quite a few nights where I find myself sitting in my bathroom sink and going ham on my pimples and blackheads.) I've found that if I wash my face and then slather on this moisturizer when I wake up in the morning, the damage isn't nearly as bad as I think it's going to be - most likely because of the zinc PCA that helps to reduce redness. What to Consider Before Trying the Cocokind Electrolyte Water Cream One thing to note is that this is a lightweight moisturizer. If you have extremely dry skin, the brand recommends opting for a product like the Cocokind Resurrection polypeptide Cream ($27), which is more suitable for anyone looking to seriously boost their skin's moisture levels. Where the Cocokind Electrolyte Water Cream Is Available The Cocokind Electrolyte Water Cream is available directly on the brand's website.

    "description": "Lately, my nails have been reflecting the wear and tear of 2024. Traditionally, they are long, strong, shiny, and don't show any discoloration. My nails used to be able to handle anything: the occasional Gel-X manicure, press-ons, intricate 3D designs, playful nail trends, and endless color sans breaks - without showing any damage. But in the last six weeks, my nail beds have developed ridges, decreased in size, continuously break, and chip easily when polished. I started taking Biotin three weeks ago, the protein that aids in nail health. And although it's been helping, in an attempt to speed up the process, I've been investing in nail strengtheners. Formulated with keratin, nail strengtheners are known to rebuild nails that are prone to breaking by creating a protective barrier on the surface. This prevents damage from daily activities, chemicals, and water. I've been testing different nail strengtheners for three weeks now and am convinced this is the hero product for flimsy, peeling, breaking and damaged nails. The result: a curated list of eight nail strengtheners to help bring life back into your nails.",
