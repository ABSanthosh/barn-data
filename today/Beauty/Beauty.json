    "description": "Image Source: Getty Images/Angela Weiss It looks like this summer will be filled with scorching temperatures, Labubus hanging off of everyone's tote bag, and, polka dot manicures. Although the trend might seem reminiscent of something you put on your nails at summer camp in middle school, this design is back with a major update - and celebrities are leading the way. One thing that's making polka dot nails look updated and effortlessly chic for 2025 is the nail shape celebrities are rocking them with. Hailey Bieber recently posted an Instagram combining two trends: butter yellow nails and polka dot nails. She had long almond nails that are rounded at the tip, which is definitely not a nail shape that was popular in our summer-camp era. And, adding her own unique twist, Sabrina Carpenter just wore polka dot nails with rhinestones acting as some of the dots. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Zola Ganzorigt (@nailsbyzola) Her manicure was done by celebrity artist Zola Ganzorigt, who works with stars like Kylie Jenner, Sydney Sweeney, and even Bieber. If you look closely, you can spot rhinestones applied interchangeably with a few of the white dots that spread all over the nail. Instead of a chrome finish (which many celebs are loving right now), the polka dot design is covered with a high-shine, regular glaze. This isn't the first time Carpenter rocked polka dot nails. She had white dots for her recent \"Manchild\" music video, and Ganzorigt revealed the exact shades she used on Instagram. For the base, Ganzorigt created a pinky nude shade with two colors: OPI Gelcolor in Passion ($16) and OPI Gelcolor in Bare My Soul ($16). For the crisp white dots, she used OPI Gelcolor in Alpine Snow ($15). It's likely that the same shades were used for the newest look that had a few rhinestones mixed in, which added a subtle glam effect to the style. If you decide to try this look at home, you will need a UV gel light, since these are salon quality gel colors. However, you can always try the look with regular polish, using an Art Dotting Tool ($6). You can even pick up Nail Art Rhinestones ($8) to add some flair to your own manicure.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/taylor-swift-red-lipstick-48605055",
    "description": "Image Source: Getty/ROBYN BECK/AFP There is but one lingering question that comes to mind post-Taylor Swift's many appearances (whether Eras Tour or NFL-related), and that is about her red lipstick. Google searches for the exact hue she wears reportedly jumped 669 percent after she was first spotted at the Kansas City Chiefs game at the start of the season 2023 - and fan tweets are alive and well today, from the \"not me wearing red lipstick again\" to the \"TAYLOR IF YOU DON'T RELEASE A RED LIPSTICK LINE IN MY LIFETIME ILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU\" - which can only confirm one thing: the people want answers - and we have them. It's a happy coincidence that the Chiefs' signature color is red, supplying Swift with ample opportunities to wear the shade while cheering alongside Donna Kelce and friends, as she did for the AFC Championship on Jan. 26. The more complicated reality is that Swift has been wearing red lipstick since the moment she hit the music scene - the one constant in this ever-changing world, if you will - meaning she's had a number of favorites on rotation over the years. There's MAC Ruby Woo ($23), the classic shade she confirmed she loved to People in 2015. There's also the Nars Matte Lip Pencil in Dragon Girl ($30), which has been a staple for the star for years. Image Source: Getty/David Eulitt/Stringer These days, according to her most recent makeup artist, the one and only Pat McGrath, the star has been wearing the LiquiLust Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick ($34) in Elson 4 from McGrath's eponymous brand, Pat McGrath Labs. The formula is also editor-approved and promises to be smudgeproof, which, if you've been watching video footage of that \"Tayvis\" kiss in Argentina on repeat (and let's be real: who isn't?) you'll know this fact is of the utmost importance. While the LiquiLust Matte Lipstick tends to be out of stock - hello, \"Swiftie effect\" - we've tested the brand's Dramatique Mega Lip Pencil ($29) in Elson 6, which is a solid alternative with a similar color payoff. (You can read our full review here, and it was also awarded a PS Beauty Award.) Otherwise, in the past Swift's longtime makeup artist Lorrie Turk has also shared a handful of red lipstick favorites that could be a good indicator of what she uses on a regular basis, including, but not limited to: Patrick Ta Major Beauty Headlines Lipstick ($32) in That's Why She's Late, Fenty Beauty Stunna Lip Paint Longwear Fluid Lip Color ($29) in Uncensored, and Lisa Eldridge True Velvet Lipstick ($36) in Velvet Ribbon. As with most things the singer touches, there's also plenty of online fodder and speculation from fans on whether her lipstick of choice gives a nod to her best friend Selena Gomez's beauty line, Rare Beauty. The punchy, cool-toned red and matte finish of the Rare Beauty Lip Soufflé Matte Cream Lipstick ($20) in Inspire looks like it could be a spot-on match, so it's certainly a contender. Only time will tell which of the above lipstick(s) was used during her date nights with Blake Lively and, ahem, others. In the meantime, we'll be sipping our caramel nonfat latte from Starbucks in a black turtleneck, patiently waiting.

    "title": "Is “Office Air” The Reason My Skin Looks Worse After Work?",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/office-air-dull-skin-complexion-after-work?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "By the time I’ve made it home from work — sweaty from the commute and exhausted by the daily air-con battle — I think that surely I’ve been through enough. But no: my reflection, featuring a greasy forehead, smudged mascara, flaky chin, and dry lips, is ready and waiting to add insult to injury. Ever since I’ve experienced the joys of working from home (comfy clothes, reality TV breaks at lunch, and maybe even working from bed), going into the office feels like a chore. I have to put my sad little salad into a plastic container, trudge to the train station, weighed down on one side by a flimsy, impractical tote bag holding my laptop, and elbow my way on and off the subway — all just to get to my desk. Once I’m finally there, I’ll spend the day battling more temperature swings than an intrepid explorer as my coworkers argue over the A/C settings. The windows barely open, there’s no fresh air, and somehow, I’m still supposed to get work done. As much as I smile (read: grimace) through it, it turns out my face is giving the game away — and I don’t mean my expression. What is “office air”? At first, I blamed the office bathrooms. Most are so brightly lit that you could interrogate someone in them. The mirrors aren’t exactly forgiving, either, but they’re not the issue. It’s what’s happening to my skin — and it seems I’m not the only one. On TikTok, the phrase “office air” appears in 80.6 million posts, where one complaint comes up again and again — the same dry skin, shiny forehead, and cracked lips after a day in the office: “Office air is the most fatal of them all,” laments one poster in a video with 1.2 million views. “No matter how good I try to make myself look in the morning, I’m going to leave the office looking like I just ran a marathon and washed my face with grease.”  I can relate — and it got me thinking: I change my routine depending on the weather outside (more sunscreen in summer, thicker moisturizer in winter), but I’ve never considered the changing climate inside, or on the way there. Before I go to HR to request a remote contract (dramatic? Me?), I thought I’d ask the experts for advice on how to tackle our collective office skin woes. Is commuting bad for your skin? According to experts, our skin goes through just as much in a day at the office as we do tackling our to-do lists. First up, there’s the commute. Unless you live and work in the countryside, you’re probably travelling to or through a busy town or city, either on foot or via public transportation. “Commuting in a polluted environment presents a challenge for the skin,” says Dr. Derrick Phillips, a consultant dermatologist and CeraVe ambassador. Adding, “Airborne pollutants like nitrogen dioxide [from vehicle emissions] and particulate matter can penetrate the skin.” This can trigger inflammation (think redness and swelling), increase melanin production leading to hyperpigmentation, and speed up the breakdown of collagen, the protein that gives skin its strength and suppleness.  It might feel like you’re sheltered from the elements at your desk, but the fluctuating temperatures can affect your skin, too: “[Air-conditioning] strips the air of humidity,” says skin expert Fiona Brackenbury. “This causes stress to the skin and leads to dehydration [think tight, dull skin], dryness, and increased sensitivity.”  Certain types of air-conditioning can be particularly drying, adds Brackenbury: “Especially ones that are continuously cool and recirculate the same indoor air,” she explains. This, teamed with a lack of openable windows — common in most high-rise office buildings — means the skin isn’t exposed to much oxygen. “Combined with dehydration, this leaves skin looking dull and fatigued,” says Brackenbury. At what point should I start petitioning my manager for a tweakments budget?  With so many factors at play, my flaky, red, oily, and dehydrated face by 6 p.m. is no longer a mystery. Just call me beauty’s answer to Scooby Doo. So what can I — a reasonable woman who knows dry skin isn’t a valid excuse for a remote contract — do about it? The sensible answer is to tweak my skincare routine. Consider an antioxidant serum Pollution particles can generate molecules called ‘free radicals’, which damage healthy skin cells by causing them to oxidize. To prep and protect your skin for a pollution-heavy commute, consider adding an antioxidant serum to your morning routine. Antioxidants act like tiny shields on the skin’s surface, fighting off free radicals from car exhaust fumes, cigarette smoke, UV, and even recycled indoor air — all while brightening skin over time. The most common antioxidant is vitamin C. While it can be used morning and night, experts often recommend it for AM use. Even better: follow with sunscreen for added UV protection.  If you’re a seasoned vitamin C user and want to level up, try Paula’s Choice 25% Vitamin C + Glutathione Clinical Serum for Brightening \u0026 Dark Spots, $65. For beginners or those with reactive skin, The Ordinary’s Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution, $14.80, offers the same brightening benefits in a gentler formula. Besides vitamin C, Brackenbury suggests looking for dedicated serums containing either brightening and oil-reducing niacinamide, vitamin E, or resveratrol — all ingredients that protect against environmental damage, support collagen production, and soothe skin. Try Neutrogena Hydro Boost 10% Niacinamide Serum, $28.99, Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Instant Firming Serum, $84, or e.l.f. Bright Icon Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Serum, $16, with a long list of antioxidants including vitamin C, E, and ferulic acid. When in doubt, double cleanse Even with an antioxidant serum, skin can still pick up grime and pollution throughout the day. When you get home, Brackenbury recommends double cleansing to remove the day’s buildup. “Try a hydrating, non-stripping cleanser,” she advises — and you don’t have to use two different ones. I rate The Inkey List’s Hydrating Cream-to-Milk Cleanser, $19, which works brilliantly as both a first and second cleanse, gently melting away sunscreen and makeup. Post-cleanse is also the ideal time to exfoliate, says Brackenbury. Try an exfoliating toner like Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant, $35, with salicylic acid to minimize breakouts and blackheads, or L’Oréal Paris 5% Glycolic Acid Peeling Toner, $25.99, to smooth rough texture and even out skin tone. If you can, do your evening skincare routine early to give your skin a head start on recovery and repair, says Brackenbury. Look after your skin barrier To protect your skin from drying A/C and a lack of fresh air, focus on maintaining a strong skin barrier. This outer layer of skin helps lock in moisture and keep out irritants like bacteria. Think of it as a brick wall: skin cells are the bricks, held together by a mortar of fats and lipids — like ceramides — that keep skin soft and healthy. When that mortar weakens, moisture escapes, leading to dryness and sensitivity. Besides a gentle cleanser, Dr. Phillips recommends investing in a moisturizer containing either ceramides, niacinamide, or panthenol, all of which will seal in hydration and support the skin barrier.  Sip and spritz Just as you’d feel the effects of forgetting to sip from your Stanley cup during back-to-back meetings, your skin can start to feel uncomfortably dehydrated as your morning skincare wears off. Brackenbury recommends spritzing skin throughout the day with a hydrating, barrier-supporting mist. Try The Inkey List Hydro-Surge Dewy Face Mist, $13, or Violette_FR Boum Boum Milk, $43, if you have more to spend. It goes without saying: drink plenty of water, too. But if you want to go the extra mile, Brackenbury suggests a desktop humidifier. “This can help restore moisture in the air around your workspace,” she explains. (Drowning out loud colleagues is simply a bonus.) Try to stress less Then there’s stress. Unless you’re a puppy yoga instructor, everyone’s job is stressful to some degree — and, you guessed it, stress isn’t great for your skin. Dr. Phillips explains that stress affects hormone levels, triggering a rise in cortisol: “[This] can result in changes to sebum levels,” subsequently increasing the skin’s oil production, he adds. Alongside excess oil, cortisol also amplifies inflammation (think redness and puffiness), further exacerbating skin conditions like rosacea, eczema, and acne. While no amount of skincare will make work less stressful, there are steps we can take to ease the tension in our lives: “Stress management is just as important and should not be overlooked,” says Dr. Phillips. “Whether it’s regular movement, mindfulness, or therapy, managing stress will improve your skin and your mental health.” Cutting back on caffeine throughout the day can also help reduce feelings of jitteriness and unease. Choose your makeup wisely With skincare out of the way, office air can also challenge makeup’s staying power. Dehydrated skin can lead to a patchy base and flaky lipstick, while excess oil causes smudged mascara and a shiny T-zone. Happily, Dr. Phillips suggests that tailoring your skincare routine to combat the effects of office life can even help your makeup last longer. But beyond skincare, choose your makeup products wisely. A smoothing primer like Milani Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Smoothing Primer, $15.99, will help grip a wayward base. Keeping your lips moisturized throughout the day with nourishing balm, such as S’able Labs Moringa Lip Salve, $23, will also prevent flaking and revive your lipstick. For eyes, consider a tubing mascara like Merit Clean Lash Lengthening Mascara, $26, or Revolution Wrap Lash Tubing Mascara, $12, both of which are smudgeproof yet easy to remove with water. Lastly, to control shine throughout the day, finish your makeup with a little translucent powder like Refy Skin Finish Powder, $32 — ideal for soaking up excess sebum on the forehead, nose, and chin instantly and throughout the day.  This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK.

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. When it comes to fashion and beauty, the end of May was defined by one thing and one thing only: The Cannes Film Festival. After a so-called “decency” rule that cracked down on nudity and long trains on the famed red carpet, some could assume that the looks would be more reserved and restrained. But thankfully, our favorite stars still brought the heat to the South of France, including Charli XCX wearing a lilac feathered YSL silk slip and Dakota Johnson partying in a sheer crystal-embellished Gucci gown. Even in the rain, Rihanna made the case for aquamarine being the color of the season, attending the Highest 2 Lowest premiere in a blue knotted Alaïa dress — complete with an umbrella. When it came to beauty, Julia Garner turned heads in a dark vampy lip and slick bleached hair, while Gabriette kept it all about the eyes with heavy black liner and a nude lip. But it was Bella Hadid that really got everybody talking — likely making tobacco blonde the salon request of the summer. As we look ahead to June, we’re turning our attention away from the red carpet and towards the store shelves, with a never-ending selection of beauty and fashion launches coming our way this month.To discover all our favorite products and collections dropping this June, click through the slideshow ahead.Skims x Roberto CavalliYour swimsuit collection just got an upgrade courtesy of Skims x Roberto Cavalli.

That’s why cream-to-powder products are on our radar this summer, including Kylie Cosmetics' latest Hybrid Blush. Combining the easy-to-blend nature of cream makeup and the smoothing effect of a powder, the new product brands itself as “mistake-proof.” Available in eight different shades, our favorite hues include Sienna (a terracotta orange) and Slow Jam (a punchy grape shade).Available to shop now at Kylie Cosmetics Kylie Cosmetics Hybrid Blush, $, available at Kylie CosmeticsLevi’s x Sacai collection Levi’s might be an all-American classic, but it’s bringing something fresh to the table this summer thanks to a collaboration with Japanese luxury fashion brand Sacai. Known for its experimental, patchwork takes on formal wear, Sacai is now bringing its love of fusion to Levi’s denim, with a blazer-denim jacket hybrid and belted dark-wash jeans. However, it’s the full-length flared denim jumpsuit that has really caught our eye, modeled by Chase Sui Wonders in the latest campaign. Available to shop now at Levi’sAnastasia Beverly Hills Smooth Blur Contour StickStick applicators have redefined contouring, making it easier than ever to accentuate cheekbones and add dimension to the face.
