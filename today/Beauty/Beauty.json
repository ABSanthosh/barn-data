    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/browlick-eyebrow-trend?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Raise your hand if you’ve got a “wild” eyebrow. If we were in a room together and not reading this on our phones, most people’s hands would be in the air. Maybe you have a few brow hairs that fire up at an angle; if you’re nodding along, you have what many brow artists affectionately call a “browlick” — and lucky you. What is a browlick? As the name suggests, a browlick is an eyebrow cowlick, and the hybrid term is slowly gaining traction on TikTok, where users are embracing the natural look. Like cowlicks in our hairlines, browlicks are characterized by one little section or patch of curls or splays against the grain. “What I see for some people is a little puff of hair in the very front of the brow that aims in the other direction, like towards the nose,” says brow artist Joey Healy. There’s a trend component, too, as experts say that brow lamination — a treatment that relaxes hairs and makes them more uniform — has all but died out. “The laminated look is so specific and calls attention to itself,” says Healy, and the same seems to be true for microblading. Instead of heavy brow hair manipulation, the current trend appreciates a natural brow shape and its nuances, encouraging browlicks — and even fashioning them using brow makeup — for character. How do I know if I have a browlick? If you want to know if you have a browlick, consult your left eyebrow first. “At least 50% of my clients have a browlick,” says natural brow artist Denise Barbosa, “and almost always, it’s on their heart side.” Brow artist Laura Frostad notes the same: “In the years I’ve been doing brows, about 90% of the brow cowlicks are only in the left brow,” she says, although it’s not clear why. “I asked dermatologists why this might be the case,” says Barbosa, “but no one seems to have an exact answer. Most of the time, they say it’s genetics.” Scientists believe cowlicks are in large part hereditary, so it stands to reason that browlicks could be, too. While you can have a browlick in the arch or the tail of your brow — left or right — it’s most commonly at the head, right near the bridge of your nose. “The beginning of the brow is a very unique part of the brow,” explains Healy. “What we see is one brow will kind of spray up in this little firework [pattern],” he adds, while the other brow naturally lays flat. Actor Zoey Deutch serves as a perfect example, thanks to a browlick on the head of her left brow. “It’s a beautiful thing,” adds Healy. “Your brows should not be identical or perfectly symmetrical; if they’re made or manipulated to be symmetrical, this can actually create an imbalance.” What should I do with my browlick? First, what not to do with your browlick: Tweeze it away. “If you chop the fluffy brow, it’s a completely reductive way of handling it, and it [might] not look great,” says Healy. Instead, Healy offers “gentle modifications” to maintain asymmetry and balance. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Robert Rumsey (@robrumseymua) First, Healy recommends using a brow powder to fill in any sparse areas at or around the browlick. “In the very front, where the hair tends to go up more, you start to see hair and skin, and it can look a little gappy,” says Healy. “There, I like to use a little powder just to give the brow a bit of strength behind it. There’s no need to make these hair-like flicks or strokes — just a whisper of color to put a little shadow on the skin. That way, the brows look uniformly dense.” Healy recommends his Joey Healy brow powder because it’s “super light and soft.” Step two: You can brush out the non-browlick brow to bring it closer to the one that has a browlick: “Use a tinted gel in the area that doesn’t have the lick and feather it up a little bit,” offers Healy. “I would recommend using something with a very fine brush and a very opaque gel, like our Brow Laquer — something that will really hold, and kind of fan the other [brow] in the opposite direction. While they’ll still be different, that can help them feel a little bit more balanced.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Robert Rumsey (@robrumseymua) However, the best ‘hack’ is reframing your perspective: “People have been trained to dislike the differences between their two brows,” says Healy. “I’m always asked to ‘fix’ the ‘weird’ brow, and I’m happy to do that, but it’s a cool reframe to lean into the individuality.” What you find most frustrating about your brows, others may find charming — some might even try to replicate it. How do I create a browlick? If you haven’t been blessed with a browlick, a little strong hold brow gel — like benefit 24-HR Brow Setter Clear Brow Gel, $27 — is all you need to create a faux or temporary look. Simply brush the head of one brow upwards and angle the hairs towards the bridge of your nose, emulating the charm of a browlick. It’s perhaps an odd comparison, but Healy is convinced that the browlick is going to become the brow version of faux freckles: “People can give themselves a browlick, and it will look natural and add interest to the face,” he says. “To break perfection makes everything prettier.” Like what you see?

From the Japanese manicure — an intensive treatment that buffs vitamin-rich pastes into the nails — to the ‘nail facial’, which nourishes by using cuticle oils and strengthening base coats, it seems we’re all eager to undo the damage caused by years of acrylics and the (arguably satisfying) habit of peeling off gel polish. But there’s a new treatment on the block, and it promises healthier, stronger nails after just one session.  Enter: the collagen manicure. What is a collagen manicure? Before diving into how collagen benefits nails, it’s important to note that collagen is a natural protein found primarily in the skin, keeping it smooth, supple, and strong. As we age, our collagen levels run low, which is why skincare brands often add collagen to serums and moisturizers, most of which claim to plump the skin and reduce fine lines. But whether topical collagen products can boost deeper collagen reserves is still up for debate. What topical collagen products can do, however, is hydrate and moisturize the surface of the skin. Where does the collagen manicure come in, then? Session manicurist Ami Streets explains that the collagen manicure is a treatment that uses collagen-infused products. It might start with a hand scrub, followed by a collagen-packed hand mask, nail polish, a rich collagen lotion, and a heavy helping of cuticle oil to nourish and hydrate dry, brittle nails and the surrounding skin.  “One of my favorite products to use during manicure prep is collagen-infused pre-soaked gloves,” says Streets, referring to Caci’s Rejuvenating Hand Mask, which contains hydrolyzed collagen, hydrating hyaluronic acid, and deeply moisturizing shea butter to soften the skin. Also try VOESH Collagen Gloves, $19. How does a collagen manicure work, and what are the nail benefits? But here’s the thing: Streets says collagen-infused manicures and products tend to benefit the skin more than the nails themselves. That said, healthy, moisturized cuticles play a key role in promoting nail growth and strength, so the two go hand in hand: “Collagen molecules are typically too large to be absorbed directly into the nail plate,” explains Streets, “but they can improve the appearance of nails, cuticles and hands by softening skin and temporarily boosting hydration when topically applied.” While collagen-infused hand and nail products mainly provide surface-level hydration and temporary plumping effects, Streets notes they can still help maintain the skin barrier — the outermost layer of skin that locks in moisture and keeps out bacteria. She says this can improve skin and nail texture over time. But the specific type of collagen is important: “Collagen molecules are typically too large to penetrate deeply into the nail plate in their natural form, as skin and nails act as protective barriers,” says Streets. Instead, look out for treatments and products containing hydrolyzed collagen, which consists of smaller molecules that can penetrate more easily. “These stimulate the skin to produce more collagen and support skin hydration,” adds Streets. How much does a collagen manicure cost — and how long does it last? A professional collagen-infused manicure can cost between $30 and $100, depending on location. Streets says the effects of a collagen manicure are generally short-term: “Any hand- and cuticle-plumping effects tend to last a day or two,” she adds.  Can you do a collagen manicure at home? Besides hand masks (a staple in most professional collagen manicures), there are some at-home collagen-infused nail products, too. Nails Inc.’s Powered by Collagen Nail Polish Remover, $8, is acetone-free and packed with collagen to moisturize the skin while gently dissolving polish. Sally Hansen Nailgrowth Miracle Treatment, $8.49, is enriched with multivitamins, keratin, and moisturizing collagen to improve the look and feel of weak, peeling nails instantly (thanks to the subtle gloss finish) and over time. Streets also recommends several other ingredients that can improve collagen as well as skin and nail health. First, chemical exfoliators like alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), such as glycolic and lactic acid. Dr. Dana Stern, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of nail care brand Dr. Dana, believes that, like skin, exfoliation is essential for improving nail damage and effectively hydrating nails. Her Nail Renewal System, $29, features the Glycolic Prep For Nails, a nail wand soaked with glycolic acid to buff away damaged nail cells.  Streets also recommends retinol, which kickstarts collagen production. Try a nightly slathering of hand cream like Nécessaire The Hand Retinol, $38, or Spice Beauty Hand Cream with CBD + Retinol, $42. Lastly, most manicurists link healthy nail growth to the use of cuticle oil, so consider one packed with a collagen-stimulating antioxidant ingredient like vitamin C. Try Nails Inc. Vit C Please Cuticle Oil, $9, with the addition of moisturizing vitamin E. “Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis”, says Streets. How can you improve the health of your nails and make them grow faster? Finally, as with any nail care routine, Streets emphasises consistency. If fortnightly collagen manicures aren’t feasible, she recommends nightly cuticle oil application, regular use of hand cream (those containing sunscreen further preserve collagen), and wearing gloves to protect skin and nails during tasks like cleaning.

    "title": "I Got Neck Botox to Treat My Tech Neck Wrinkles - and It Worked",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/neck-botox-before-after-49342870",
    "description": "The thing I've started picking up on as I get older (I'm 34) is that once I notice something new about my skin, I can't unsee it. It doesn't matter if it's something tiny that only I will notice. Once it's been identified, the obsessing begins. That was the case for my neck wrinkles. I was just living my life, and then one day, seemingly out of the blue, I had developed relatively deep lines and wrinkles from the chin down. Apparently - to my great chagrin - I should have paid more attention to all that talk about ways to prevent tech neck and actually followed a skin-care routine for the area. Because I will now never not be able to look past those wrinkles, I took to the internet to figure out how to get rid of those pesky reminders of my scrolling habit. The solution was right in front of me: neck Botox injections. If it's good enough for Kim Kardashian, as she told People, it's good enough for me. I immediately made an appointment with Parvaneh Rafaeloff, MD, at her med sp,a Le Jolie, a celebrity favorite in Beverly Hills. Keep reading to see my results and get a sense of the neck Botox experience. Experts Featured in This Article Parvaneh Rafaeloff, MD, is the founder of med spa Le Jolie, located in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles. What Is Neck Botox? Neck Botox is exactly what it sounds like: Botox injections in the neck area. Botox is a neurotoxin used to paralyze the muscles, helping to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Your doctor will place the injections directly along those horizontal lines on your neck for a targeted approach. (This is not the same as traptox, which is Botox injected into your trapezius muscles.) It's worth noting that in this story, we're specifically talking about the Botox brand of neurotoxin, but you could also use other brands such as Dysport, Xeomin, or Daxxify. Dr. Rafaeloff notes that each brand has its own formulation and may have slightly different dosing and duration of effects. What Does Neck Botox Treat? According to Dr. Rafaeloff, Botox injections in the neck can effectively treat wrinkles, lines, and neck bands. Botox is not primarily used for treating significant sagging or laxity of the skin. \"There are other procedures for sagging skin such as Forma, Emface, or Morpheus8,\" Dr. Rafaeloff says. While Botox is considered the gold standard for smoothing wrinkles, there are some other treatments you could opt for. However, those tend to have much more significant aftercare and downtime than Botox. Take Ultherapy for example. This procedure uses high-intensity focused ultrasound to target deeper levels of the dermis. It heats up and traumatizes cells in order to generate new collagen. I've done this procedure and can attest that it hurts. I have a pretty high tolerance for pain, especially for cosmetic procedures, so trust me, it's not fun. Plus, it doesn't give the immediate results of Botox. You could also go the laser route, but then you're looking at significant downtime, scabbing, and no guarantee that deeper wrinkles will lessen. TLDR: if you want pretty much guaranteed results with little pain and no downtime, I recommend Botox. My Neck Botox Experience Like I mentioned, I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but Dr. Rafaeloff added some numbing cream to my neck just in case. This is because the skin on the neck is pretty thick, so pushing the needle through isn't as buttery as on the skin of the face. Once I was numbed, Dr. Rafaeloff hit the wrinkles on both sides of my neck with injections - I have three deep lines going across my neck that she targeted. She warned that it might be slightly painful since the skin on my neck was quite taut (a win for me, finally), but I found the pain to be pretty nonexistent. All in all, the appointment was around 20 minutes. There are a lot of procedures billed as \"lunchtime treatments\" - this one definitely falls under that. You're in and out in under an hour (sometimes under 30 minutes), and you look pretty normal afterward. I was slightly sore after the numbing cream wore off a few hours later, but nothing prohibitive. In terms of results, it takes anywhere from two to 14 days for the effects of Botox to kick in. For me, I usually start seeing it take effect in my face after about three or four days - it took a full seven days for my neck to smooth out, I'm guessing because the wrinkles were deeper there. Neck Botox Side Effects Like with any injections, common side effects of Botox injections in the neck include temporary bruising, swelling, or redness at the injection site. As you can see above, I had some minor redness immediately after, but by the next morning I was back to normal. I also tend to get a mild headache for the rest of the day after getting Botox. Neck Botox Aftercare Anytime you get a 'tox injection, you should make sure to stay upright for at least four hours after your appointment (no naps!) and avoid working out for 24 hours. Similarly, you'll want to wait a few days before any massaging of the area; make sure to schedule any facials at least three days after your Botox appointment (I give it a week just to be safe). This is all to help prevent the Botox migrating to other parts of your body. Dr. Rafaeloff also recommends slugging with Aquaphor for a few nights after your injection to keep everything hydrated and supple. Is Neck Botox Worth It? If you're like me and unable to stop obsessing over wrinkles once they appear, then yes, neck Botox is worth it. Keep in mind that Botox is not cheap and doesn't last forever - Dr. Rafaeloff says she injects anywhere from 30 to 60 units in the neck (at the standard $15 per unit, you're looking at a $450 to $900 bill every four months or so). If it's worth it to you to shell out some cash for a wrinkle-free existence, then Botox is the way to go. Aviel Kanter was a former director of branded content for Vox Media.",

    "description": "Maybe you've never even thought about removing your pubic hair. I don't know your life! But in the event that you - like me at age 13, during the delightful stage known by endocrinologists as puberty - are plagued with the question of how to shave your vagina (or, to be anatomically correct, your vulva, since the vagina is all internal), there are a few things to keep in mind. First, don't do what I did and drag your razor across the skin in a back-and-forth direction until it's all smooth, like my decidedly cooler ninth-grade friend told me to. This, I can attest, leads only to unsightly ingrown hairs and tiny red bumps that will make you feel like a plucked chicken. Instead, you'll want to treat this delicate area, well, delicately, because shaving your pubic hair isn't the same as shaving anywhere else on your body. \"The hair in the pubic area is different from leg hair,\" Caitlin Orszulak, a senior scientist for P\u0026G, says. \"On average, pubic hair is about twice as thick as leg hair, tends to be curly, and can grow in multiple directions. On top of that, the hair in the pubic area tends to be much denser, meaning there's more hair per square cm versus on a leg.\" She adds that your skin down yonder is also thinner, meaning it's more permeable to moisture loss. \"Finally, the deeper layer of skin in the pubic area has more nerve endings and higher blood flow than the legs, making this area particularly sensitive.\" This is all to say, there are a quite few things to know on how to shave pubic hair safely, and that is precisely why we tapped a handful of grooming experts to help. Keep scrolling for some pro tips on shaving your nether regions below. Experts Featured in This Article Caitlin Orszulak is a senior scientist and product researcher for P\u0026G's grooming category.
