    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jonelle-awomoyi-bbc-journalist-viral-hair-discrimination?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "As a journalist and presenter, I’m constantly having viral moments. I’ll deliver a news story, and millions of people will see it, and that’s just the norm, the day-to-day, but I’m not necessarily the topic of that viral moment. Yet after a recent news report I made was posted online, millions of people were talking about my appearance on social media — my “bad hair day” at work — and then that became the conversation, people made videos about it, and shared their own ideas of what went on. It’s not something I expected.  On 28 March 2025, I headed into the BBC offices in London, where I present the news for the broadcaster’s social media pages. We’d been alerted that there was a tragic earthquake in Myanmar, and when things like that happen, it’s all hands on deck — everyone is working to ensure we cover the story as well as possible. As well as reporting on the tragic event, I was scheduled to interview professional wrestler Tiffany Stratton on location that day, but the main aim was to make sure that we were covering the earthquake and the fatalities. It meant that I was quite rushed for time, leaving no time for hair and makeup. I rushed to the interview and was aware that my hair didn’t necessarily look as well as I’d wanted. It was my first time trying a sew-in with a leave-out, and to be honest, I do think the humidity had a massive effect, because when I first arrived at the office, my hair was laid and slayed! But that’s the thing, when you straighten your natural hair, you just don’t know what it’s going to do. The interview was posted online on April 1 and soon went viral, and thousands of people commented on how my hair looked. It is a shame, because the story was about women’s empowerment and women in sport. I spoke to a champion in her field, and people weren’t able to take from that when they saw the video.  I didn’t notice the comments at first. When I finally did, some of them were quite funny, but as the post blew up, it got more hateful and abusive. When I noticed the hate growing, I needed to make sure people knew that it is never okay, so I posted a video to my TikTok page, @jonelleawomoyi, in response to nip it in the bud.  People know it’s wrong, even when they try to disguise abusive comments as “banter”. When you’re in the public eye, many people have the assumption that because you chose this public lifestyle, if you get praise, then you should also expect negativity. And some feel like they have a right to hold public-facing people accountable. But there’s an obvious line.  In general, women are subject to a lot of criticism based on the way they look. And when you think about that intersectionally, when it comes down to race and gender, it seems Black women are under heavier scrutiny when it comes to the way we look. There are massive billion-dollar industries making money from us having these high standards for the way we present ourselves, so I understand where this comes from.  Growing up as Black women, there can be pressures to have our hair “on point” and “laid” — and I’m using these words specifically because they emphasize just how culturally significant our hair is. So, it was disheartening seeing that a lot of the comments on the video were coming from Black women. Still, I did try and approach those criticizing me with some compassion. A lot of people have internalized negative messages they’ve received based on the way they look, and then they project those messages onto other people. However, whilst I have compassion, I had to make it clear that the comments were still wrong, regardless of the reasoning behind them. A while back, I posted a video on TikTok of me doing a news report with my natural hair and then going on a walk — the wind just blew it out of the way! It’s one of those things: when I get to my destination, I have no idea how I’m going to look. But that’s fine, because it’s just hair at the end of the day. We all have different hair types, and different hair types will do different things in different environments — as Black women, we all know that. If you have type 4 hair, you’re going to be aware that when you straighten it or curl it, and you go into a different environment, there’s a possibility that it won’t look the same way that you styled it originally. We should give each other grace. In my role as a journalist, there is no one way of presenting myself. I’ve had many different hairstyles when presenting the news. Right now, I have Fulani boho braids, I’ve tried stitch braids, red braids, half up and half down, and worn my natural hair, all while presenting the news. I know that other Black news presenters may not have felt welcomed when wearing their natural hair, and hair discrimination in the workplace is a common issue many Black women have faced, but I’ve not had that issue. I present myself in a way that I feel comfortable and I feel true to myself. What’s interesting is that when I first got my job in TV, I had long blonde braids. Maybe because my work is aimed at younger audiences on social media, I have never felt my hair was a hindrance to me within this space.  Regardless, I don’t think we should steer the conversation to telling Black women how to wear their hair in any setting — many people were prescribing me different hairstyles to try — that’s just not the point here.  For me, it’s an empowering thing to be a Black woman working in journalism, connecting with diverse communities and trying to push conversations that matter. We’re lucky enough to live in a country where we have free press, but there are female journalists in Yemen, in Afghanistan, in Nigeria, in Sudan who will face terrible consequences based on doing their job in general, let alone how they present themselves. We must remember how important journalism is and how lucky we are to have free press where we’re allowed to report on things; in some countries, they’re not necessarily given those same freedoms. I also think it’s good that we’re now questioning ourselves a bit more about how we post online, how we’re using the online spaces we’re given, because it is so powerful to have an online forum where everyone in the world can get involved in conversation.  Rough hair days happen. And I hope as Black women we’re giving ourselves and other people grace, especially on the basis of how they look — if someone’s hair’s not done, is it really that important?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/iced-french-manicure-nail-trend?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "As classic as they come, the French manicure remains one of the most popular nail looks of all time for good reason: it’s chic, goes with everything, and never looks dated. It makes sense, then, that with minimalist manicures dominating as the most popular nail trends of 2025 so far, we’re seeing many nail artists looking for ways to upgrade the humble French tip for the year ahead. We’ve already spotted the seriously glowy tinted French taking off and the ultra-cool chrome French tips, but spring’s latest upgrade might just be our favorite yet. Enter: the “iced French”.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Виктория Климович | маникюр Минск| обучение | онлайн | курсы (@viktoriya.klimovich) What is the iced French manicure? We first noticed this look on the Instagram feed of bridal manicurist Carmelina (aka @hicarmelina), who shared a photo of a chic frosted manicure, which she coined the “iced French”. A fresh upgrade to the original French manicure, Carmelina describes the look as being “clean, minimal, and elevated with a subtle shimmer that gives a cool, frosted finish.” Similar to the “angel” chrome manicure that emerged earlier in the year, it has an almost ethereal feel to it thanks to the soft, silvery color palette and sheeny finish. “The real magic happens when the light hits it,” says Carmelina. “It glows in the most understated, elegant way.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by S e l f i s h (@selfish_london) How do you create the iced French manicure? This look is all about layering sheer colors with soft textures, but it’s actually quite simple to achieve. To start, a milky base is needed to keep everything feeling light and dream-like. Carmelina is clear that the key to this look is opting for a milky white color and avoiding a pink base. Try something like Manucurist’s Green Natural Nail Polish in Milky White, £14. Next, a soft chrome top coat — Carmelina suggests a classic pearlescent shade — for the “signature iced effect”. Ask your manicurist for The Gel Bottle’s Pearl Chrome Pigment, $12.99, or try Essie’s Original Nail Art Studio Special Effects Nail Polish Topcoat in Cosmic Chrome, $13, at home. View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝘓𝘢𝘴𝘩 𝘌𝘹𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴 𝘉𝘪𝘢𝘣 𝘉𝘳𝘰𝘸𝘴 𝘔𝘜𝘈 (@the_deluxe_studio) Finally, finish with a “delicate French tip” as a nod to the classic manicure with a modern edge. “Any thin brush that you have on hand will work beautifully,” Carmelina says. Feeling inspired? Here are a few of our favorite iced French manicures for your next nail appointment. View this post on Instagram A post shared by نسيم رويال (@nasimroyal.nailbar) Chiffon French View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nicole | Gel Nail Artist (@nailsxbellaluna) Gel nail artist Nicole (aka @nailsxbellaluna) has created the most ethereal iced French manicure by pairing a milky base coat with a soft white chrome top coat. Utter perfection.  Cat Eye View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mélo Beauty Lounge (@melobeauty.bh) Cat eye nails are known for their ultra-high-shine finish, which means they pair perfectly with this frosty trend. Created by Mélo Beauty Lounge, the square nail shape and almost holographic effect make for a seriously cool nail look. Clean Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by House of Nails (@house__of__nails) Perfectly executed by luxury manicurist Laura (aka @house__of__nails), this looks like a classic French manicure at first glance but is elevated by an icy chrome top coat. It’s an upgraded version of clean girl nails. Iced Milk View this post on Instagram A post shared by lauren kay (@laurenkaysims) Lauren Kay‘s soft and milky set has a subtle frosted finish that adds interest to a simple (but perfectly executed) creamy French manicure. These would make beautiful wedding day nails. Sparkling Frost View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kim Truong (@kimkimnails) Make like celebrity nail artist Kim Truong and add a subtle layer of pixie dust shimmer to your set for extra dimension when it catches the light. Chilled Butter View this post on Instagram A post shared by Britt | Sydney nail artist (@bb.claws) While the French manicure is characterized by its white tip, you can really play into the “iced” element by mixing up the color. We’re obsessed with the butter yellow shade that Sydney-based nail artist Britt has used here. Ice Ombré View this post on Instagram A post shared by VANCOUVER NAIL ARTIST (@kloudy_nail.studio) The ombré French — a seamless blend on the classic tip — is taking over nail salons. Add a modern twist with a dusting of silver chrome powder for an icy, ethereal finish like this look by @kloudy_nail.studio on Instagram. This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK.

    "title": "Are All \"Firming\" Body Products a Scam?",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/firming-body-products-efficacy-49437886",
    "description": "Wouldn't it be great if we didn't have to wonder if the formulas we spend time slathering on our skin will actually do anything? In a world of youth-preserving skin care, firming products rank high on the \"do they work?\" list. These magical potions come with the promise of tighter-looking skin, but is it all a marketing ploy or do they come with real, tangible benefits? To get to the bottom of things, we tapped a dermatologist and a plastic surgeon to answer our questions. Keep reading for their firm opinions on firming products. Experts Featured in This Article Daniel Gould, MD, is a board-certified plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills. Geeta Yadav, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Facet Dermatology. Do Firming Body Products Actually Work? To understand how body-firming products work, it's important to first understand how the skin on the body changes over time. Two important proteins in our bodies are responsible for keeping the skin resilient and tight (collagen and elastin), but as we age, the production of both decline. \"Collagen is an important building block of the skin that acts like rebar, diffusing tension and compression and really improving the strength of the skin,\" says plastic surgeon Daniel Gould, MD. \"When skin on the body loses collagen, that skin becomes thinner and loses its tensile strength.\" Then there's elastin, which, as its name implies, refers to the elastic component of the skin. \"Where collagen is the support and the underlying mesh of the skin, elastin is the rubber band that allows the skin to spring back into place,\" says Dr. Gould. \"Skin that's lost its elasticity becomes stretchy, which can lead to jowl formation, laxity in the neck, and generally more hanging, loose skin on the body.\" Body-firming products are skin-care products formulated to address saggy, crepey, or stretchy skin. According to dermatologist Geeta Yadav, MD, firming skin-care products for the body can work - if you manage your expectations. \"By the time most people are seeking out products to firm the appearance of their skin, the loss of collagen and elastin is too significant, and they would benefit more from an in-office procedure or even plastic surgery. They will be very disappointed by any benefits provided by a topical formula,\" says Dr. Yadav. That's why it's best to start using topical firming treatments as a preventative measure or, at the very least, when you first start noticing the early signs of skin aging. While firming body products can work for improving collagen and elastin turnover, formulas marketed to eliminate cellulite are a different story. As Dr. Yadav explains, these products tend to improve the appearance of cellulite temporarily, and you're better off doing an in-office procedure to treat it. Ingredients to Look For If You Want to Firm Skin When shopping for firming body products, there are a few key ingredients to keep in mind. You'll want to look for peptides, which signal to your skin cells to up the ante on the collagen production. \"More collagen translates into firmer and more resilient skin; just note that these benefits take consistency and time to see,\" says Dr. Yadav. Retinol, the skin-care industry's golden child, is another beneficial ingredient for firmer skin. \"Retinol is the most frequently studied anti-aging ingredient in the skin-care arsenal and is clinically proven to address all signs of aging, including fine lines, wrinkles, and skin laxity,\" says Dr. Yadav. \"Retinol triggers cellular turnover from the bottom up, stimulating new collagen production and exfoliation - this results in smoother, brighter, firmer, and more even skin in texture and tone.\" If you're looking for a quick fix, look for caffeine on an ingredient list - it stimulates circulation, which has a temporary plumping effect on the skin. When it comes to collagen-firming body products, it's best to spend your money elsewhere. \"Collagen can't pass through the barrier of the skin to enter into the body and improve its quality,\" says Dr. Gould. That being said, the ingredient can offer some hydration to skin that needs it. Another hydrating ingredient to seek out is hyaluronic acid, which can increase the skin's water content and make crepey skin look less crepey, notes Dr. Gould. Effective Treatment Options For Firmer Skin If topical treatments just aren't cutting it, radiofrequency can be a solid option. \"Radiofrequency treatments work by delivering controlled heat to the skin, stimulating skin's natural repair processes and cellular turnover as well as the production of new collagen and elastin,\" says Dr. Yadav. These treatments can penetrate the skin deeper than a topical, though bear in mind you may need multiple treatments depending on your skin goals. Plastic surgery treatments that target excess skin are another option. While treatments like arm lifts, thigh lifts, and abdominoplasty involve an incision, recovery time, and a hefty price tag, Dr. Gould says that removing excess skin is the most powerful and reliable way to give the skin a tighter-looking appearance.

    "description": "For me, the worst part about getting a Brazilian wax isn't the pain. (Which, if you haven't had the pleasure, feels like a bolt of lightning traveling from your butthole to the back of your throat, where the audible gasp you'll inevitably be making originates.) Rather, it's the act of voluntarily spending the time and money each month to have a nice lady in pink floral scrubs completely ruin your day. I reserve these tender moments only for special occasions. For every other time I need a wax, I lean on at-home waxing kits - and a heavy pour of Cabernet Franc - to get the job done. In my quest for the best formulas out there, however, I have learned one thing (or two, if you factor in how humbling it is to try to reach the areas of your nether regions not even you have seen before): not all at-home waxing kits are created equal. Some paper strips grip the hair with aplomb; others leave behind globs of goo. Some hard wax kits are easy to maneuver; others crumble at the touch faster than a Nature Valley bar. Which ones live up to the claims of an easy, pain-free process? Um, none of them - are you even listening? But if you're in between hair removal appointments and want to give yourself a little touch-up, the DIY waxing kits ahead are about as close as it gets to the real deal. Keep scrolling to check out my best at-home waxing kit picks, as well as a mini review of each of them. Once you hit \"add to cart,\" all you'll need is a mini pep talk.",
