    "title": "The Psychology Behind the Rise and Fall of Trends",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/psychology-trend-culture-49345657",
    "description": "Cottagecore, mob wife, coastal cowgirl, coquette, glazed-doughnut nails, strawberry makeup. These are just a few of the viral aesthetics that have taken over social media throughout the last year. For the last few years, it seemed there was a new vibe being introduced every week. At first people loved it, but now, there's been a noticeable shift in the tides. Many who were excitedly riding the Trend Train have requested to get off at the next stop. So, what happened? Perhaps what felt like the impossible happened: we hit trend fatigue. The thing is, \"trends,\" which are defined by Merriam-Webster Dictionary as a \"prevailing tendency or inclination,\" have been around forever. People often like to refer back to the biggest trends of decades past - hence the fascination and reimagination of '90s makeup and 2000s hairstyles - but recently, it feels as though the cycle of trends is coming and going at an all-time high. Ahead, we spoke to psychologists to get a better understanding of trend culture. Why are we so obsessed with new and shiny aesthetics, and will we ever hit a point of oversaturation? Experts Featured in This Article Scott Lyons, PsyD, is a psychologist, author, and educator. Sanam Hafeez, PsyD, is an NYC neuropsychologist and director of Comprehend the Mind. Jenny Yip, PsyD, is a board-certified clinical psychologist and author of \"Hello Baby, Goodbye Intrusive Thoughts.\" Christie Ferrari, PsyD, is a clinical psychologist and blogger. How Do Trends Start? Trends form pretty easily: someone has to propose a new idea, and then enough people have to \"follow\" it so that it catches widespread attention. \"Trends start with something that an individual or small group gives attention to, and then [they] start to build momentum of other people's focus,\" Scott Lyons, PsyD, says. From there, they continue to grow until they've taken over our news cycle and For You Pages. However, we've seen an uptick in micro trends lately. \"While mainstream trends still garner significant attention, there has been a growing emphasis on niche communities and subcultures,\" says Sanam Hafeez, PsyD. \"Online platforms have facilitated the formation of micro-communities centered around specific interests, hobbies, and identities.\" The Psychology Behind Trends You may think that trends catch on solely because they're pretty or new and exciting, and that's certainly part of it. \"When we are provided with something new and different that a lot of people are also interested in, then it brings a sense of excitement,\" says Jenny Yip, PsyD. We, as humans, are naturally curious creatures, but the psychology behind them goes even deeper than that. We want to belong and feel connected. \"Participating in trends invites social interaction, admiration, and appreciation from others, and facilitates a sense of belonging for us while also allowing us to fit in with the crowd,\" Christie Ferrari, PsyD, also known as Dr. C, says. So, the success of trends boils down to a mix of wanting to be included while also wanting to stand out and feel special. And don't underestimate the power of FOMO in all of this - it's very real. \"There's this fear of missing out on something fun or exciting, which can push us to join in on trends even if we're not sure about them,\" Dr. Hafeez says. \"Plus, if something seems rare or hard to get, it makes us want it even more.\" (This is likely the reasoning behind the sensational Stanley Cup that had teenagers sleeping overnight outside of Target and now, flocking to Target Joe's to get the new mini tote.) Social Media's Effect on Trend Culture Trends are as old as time (even if they weren't referred to as such), but the landscape of how they thrive has shifted drastically. These days, the driving force is undeniably digital media in all of its many forms. TikTok, Instagram, and the internet as a whole (along with influencers) have democratized trend culture and made it more accessible. \"With the rise of social media, all of the world is a stage,\" Dr. Lyons says. Having all of this information at the tips of our fingers is contributing to the increased pace at which we're seeing trends. Before it, you weren't able to connect instantaneously with such a broad group of people. \"Back in the day, how did we access trends? Magazines, TV, newspapers. . . you would get one magazine a month,\" Dr. Yip says. \"Information wasn't dispersed as quickly as information is today with the internet.\" Even with the current uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future, the trends continue pop up and push onward. When talks of the app shutting down due to government regulations became more real at the beginning of January 2025, many users flocked to an entirely new platform called Red Note, so they could continue consuming content without any interruption. It seems as though even if there is a deviation in where people find the trends, they'll be there no matter what. The Impact of Micro Trends Trends used to make you feel like you were part of a greater movement. Now, however, micro trends lack the same effect. Social media has allowed countless fads to flourish - more than ever before - but it's also responsible for the shortened lifespan of these aesthetics or vibes. \"Once the trend becomes too saturated and viral, it's time for a new trend,\" Dr. C says. This cycle keeps things feeling exclusive and exciting, but it's also contributing to trend fatigue. \"With the rapid dissemination of information online, trends can become oversaturated and lose their novelty quickly,\" Dr. Hafeez says. \"This phenomenon has accelerated the turnover rate of trends, making it challenging for individuals and brands to keep up.\" The sheer number of options available to use - not just with trends but everything else, such as brands, TV shows, and books - has forced content to quickly be replaced. Dr. Yip puts it this way: \"In the first 10 minutes of a movie, if I'm not into it, there are thousands of other new movies I can choose from.\" Not to mention, collectively, our attention span is shrinking. \"We're getting bored much easier than ever before,\" Dr. Yip says. And new trends are a solution to that boredom. \"When you're feeling that sense of new excitement, it's basically your brain producing dopamine,\" she continues. So, the question is, will this ever change? \"Until it becomes trendy to not be on social media, it's unlikely,\" Dr. C says.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Everything’s coming up roses — or should we say cherries? If you’ve spent any time on beauty TikTok lately, you’ll know exactly what we mean. As temperatures continue to dip, cherry-hued makeup is everywhere. And when it comes to that moody-yet-juicy wash of color for the lips, no product does it quite like Clinique’s Almost Lipstick in Black Honey. Black Honey has been a cult favorite ever since Clinique launched this lip color in a sleek, silver tube back in 1989. With a universally flattering berry tint and sheer, buildable formula, its appeal has only grown over the years (swatching videos of Black Honey still regularly go viral on TikTok, decades after its initial release). But did you know that the Black Honey hype doesn’t stop at the lips? Clinique has quietly expanded the iconic shade into a fully fledged makeup collection, including a cheek blush, eyeliner, mascara and even an eyeshadow palette. As a longtime Black Honey devotee, I had to put the entire lineup to the test. Ahead, I’ll be breaking down my honest thoughts on each Black Honey makeup product — including the lipstick that started it all. DashDividers_1_500x100 Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey, $25 There’s a reason this lipstick is a beauty hall of famer: It imbues your lips with a natural, glossy red tint that makes you look like you were feasting on a handful of cherries and the juice just so happened to dye your lips red. Despite the gothy plum color of the product, the actual pigment upon application is sheer (but definitely noticeable) and buildable. For me, the pièce de résistance is the luscious “your lips, but better” finish that looks good on everyone, thanks to a medley of blue, red and yellow pigments that is flattering on all skin tones. This absolutely gets a 10/10 from me. Clinique, if you’re listening, please consider making a matte version of this lipstick and a Black Honey lip liner! Shop Sephora DashDividers_1_500x100 Clinique Cheek Pop Powder Blush in Black Honey Pop, $30 This little pot of blush has become a regular in my makeup bag. It has that same quality I love about the Almost Lipstick, adding a juicy, almost imperceptible flush and giving my cheekbone more dimension. I have neutral-cool undertones and this shade gives me a healthy pop of color without looking too severe. I’m impressed by how well it blends with just my fingertips without having to rub it in, and it looks great on the tip of my nose, too. Shop Ulta DashDividers_1_500x100 Clinique Pop Lip \u0026 Cheek Oil in Black Honey, $27 I can be skeptical of lip and cheek oils. The way I see it, they can do one thing well but not the other, and most lip oils are too sticky to use on the face. I’m very happy to be proven wrong by this Black Honey Lip \u0026 Cheek Oil. It’s not viscous in the slightest and feels like a conditioning balm on my lips. The color payoff on my skin is impressive, giving my cheeks a glossy, highlighter-like glow along with a deep cherry hue. I do have to reapply this product on my lips often as it rubs off quite easily. All in all, it’s a good purchase for anyone looking for an ultra-glossy version of Black Honey. Shop Ulta DashDividers_1_500x100 Clinique Pop Plush Creamy Lip Gloss in Black Honey Pop, $25 As a lip gloss girlie, I was really excited to try this one. Unfortunately, the formula left me disappointed. While there are lots of positive reviews online, with many people loving the buildable color and longevity, the formula didn’t sit right with me personally. I found the texture really sticky, and despite hydrating ingredients like shea butter and hyaluronic acid, it was very drying on my lips. In fact, my lips got so flaky by the end of the day that it took me an extra day of not wearing any lipstick to recover. The color was also not very Black Honey-esque and had a more raisiny hue. The Lip \u0026 Cheek Oil is a far better investment, if you ask me. Shop Sephora DashDividers_1_500x100 Clinique High Impact Gel Tech Eyeliner in Black Honey, $28 I’ve been swapping out my dark brown eyeliner and using this Black Honey one as a substitute. It looks a bit warmer and complements my go-to eyeshadows — mostly shimmery pinks and matte earthy tones — in an interesting way. I also love pairing this liner with a copper eyeshadow stick; it’s a fall-inspired color combo that works really well with my dark brown eyes and takes less than a minute to achieve. I do have to say that although this liner smudges out really nicely, the fade out is real, and sometimes the pigment is all gone by the end of the day. It fares much better if I top up with a fixing spray but considering the price, this is disappointing. Shop Ulta DashDividers_1_500x100 Clinique All About Shadow Octet in The Best of Black Honey, $48 This eyeshadow palette is nice but not super memorable to be completely honest. The shadows are silky-smooth and blend well but don’t show up all that much on my skin (as you can see in the selfie above). The only color that reminds me of Black Honey is a brownish-purple shade, but it doesn’t pop on my skin tone in the way that the Almost Lipstick or Powder Blush does. I do like the light pink and deep brown colors but all in all, it’s not a palette I reach for that often. Shop Ulta DashDividers_1_500x100 Clinique Black Honey High Impact Mascara, $26 Full disclosure: I rarely bother using mascara as I have the straightest and stubbiest lashes ever, which is pretty common for Asians. This mascara doesn’t do much in terms of lifting and curling my lashes. My features are quite delicate so the brush applicator is also too big and unwieldy for my small eyelids. Since I have black-brown lashes and eyes, I can’t notice the difference when my lashes are dipped in the Black Honey hue. This is personally a skip for me, but I’ve come across a few try-on videos from creators with green and blue eyes, and the burgundy color does look phenomenal on them.

    "description": "Prepare for the pixie wave. Search for ‘pixie haircuts’ spiked after the Golden Globes where Emma Stone debuted a new “defined” pixie, and since then, short haircuts have been a hot request in salons: “I think pixie cuts will become more popular in 2025,” predicts Anilsa Sanchez, a hairstylist and educator at Bumble and bumble’s Bb.Salon in NYC. “I see it as a natural progression from all the bobs we’ve been seeing.” Whether you want to inch your bob to its next evolution or chop your long hair short in one fell swoop, scroll ahead to collect all the inspiration you need in time for your next haircut. DashDividers_1_500x100 Defined Pixie View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mara Roszak (@mararoszak) “Sculpted, defined, and timeless,” is how hairstylist Mara Roszak describes the pixie cut she gave Stone for her role in the upcoming film Bugonia. Andrean Noir, a hairstylist at Bumble and bumble’s Meatpacking location, calls this “the truest shape of a pixie, similar to Mia Farrow’s now-iconic haircut from 1968. “That cut powerfully influenced the industry,” Noir says. (Case in point: Actress Brie Larson also recently chopped her hair into a “defined pixie” inspired by Mia Farrow in preparation for her role as Elektra.) Rounded Pixie View this post on Instagram A post shared by Style by Peter – Peter Corvington (@petercorvington) For many, a rounded pixie — with lots of length at the top and sides — is a good gateway short haircut. “I’ve noticed more and more of these in the salon recently,” says Noir. It’s a great option for anyone who wants a soft, rounded look versus a square shape which sometimes happens if the sides are cut short and flat. “For those who feel like square is too aggressive, rounded is the way to go,” adds Noir. “The grow-out is easy, and maintenance for this style is low.” Take inspiration from this cut by hairstylist Peter Corvington. Blunt Pixie View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jess Gonzalez (@jesstheebesttcolor) The blunt pixie cut frames the face with a more dramatic shape. With a heavy bang, Sanchez recommends styling this cut with a blowdryer and hairspray to keep it soft but in place: “Blow-dry flat with a flat brush and then shellac it with Bb. Strong Finish Firm Hold Hairspray, $50.” Choppy Pixie View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kiitan Akinniranye (@kiitana) With a choppy pixie, the bangs and the side pieces are cut to create angles at the forehead, around the ears, and even at the nape of the neck like this cut on Kiitan Akinniranye. Sanchez calls this style a “punk-inspired pixie cut,” and a “striking choice that will emphasize your style and creativity.” Textured Pixie View this post on Instagram A post shared by Isabella Sementilli // los angeles hairstylist (@isabellahair) Like the rounded pixie, the textured pixie includes lots of shape and movement around the face, like this cut by hairstylist Isabella Sementilli. The difference is that the textured pixie is cut shorter on the sides with added layers at the top to create extra volume. To style a textured pixie, a great tip is to spray a thickening spray, like the Rôz Air Thickening Spray, $39, into damp hair and let it air-dry. Beyond being a beautiful, timeless cut, you can simply wash your hair and leave the house. Like what you see?
