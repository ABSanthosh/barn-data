    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/perfume-fragrance-hormonal-effects?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Is there anything better than unboxing a perfume you’ve been dying to try — and falling in love at first spritz? It’s like unlocking a brighter mood or a shiny new version of yourself. That’s exactly how I felt when a very viral, very expensive fragrance landed on my doorstep recently. Even with friends over, I wasted no time bathing myself in the stuff. As expected, it was an instant hit among the group, except for one, who edged further and further away from my plume of scent. “None for me, thanks,” she said, arms outstretched. “Perfume can seriously mess with your hormones.”  Having worked in beauty for over 10 years, this isn’t the first time I’ve heard concerns about products that might affect hormones. Remember when we were all obsessed with buying “clean” skincare? The movement demonized certain ingredients like parabens (preservatives needed to protect products from bacteria) and sulphates (surfactants that give products their lather). Suddenly, everyone was worried about “endocrine disruptors” — substances that are said to interfere with the body’s hormonal system, impacting everything from weight and mood to fertility. Dermatologists have widely dispelled this as a myth, stating that there is no credible evidence showing that ingredients in cosmetic products disrupt hormones or pose a risk to our health. Despite this, it seems perfume has been added to the long list of questionable beauty products, and it isn’t just my friend who’s avoiding it. On TikTok, the phrase Perfume Bad For You serves up nearly 60 videos in which content creators warn their followers against wearing fragrance. Without offering solid, scientific evidence, one asserts that “fragrance is basically a word that can hide up to 3,000 chemicals within it,” while another states that perfumes are “all pretty much toxic.” A common belief is that when sprayed on the skin, these “toxic chemicals” enter the bloodstream and cause an imbalance in hormones. As you might expect, these claims have collectively racked up millions of views. But is it empty talk or a genuine cause for concern?  Perfume is meant to be a pleasure, not a source of fear, so as a self-proclaimed fragrance head, I put the question to registered toxicologist Rani Ghosh and cosmetic chemist Milan Scott — and I learned a lot. Lab-based studies that suggest fragrance ingredients can mimic hormones tend to use perfume ingredient doses far higher than what you’d ever spritz on your skin in real life. Are perfumes safe to use on the skin? Before we dive into the details, fundamentally, everything is a chemical — even water. That hasn’t stopped “clean” beauty enthusiasts from singling out a handful of perfume ingredients, though. First, phthalates, chemicals typically used to make plastics more flexible. In perfume, phthalates are often used to boost a scent’s longevity. Some common ones include diethyl phthalate (DEP) and dimethyl phthalate (DMP). Second, nitro musks, a lab-created version of natural musk.  Ghosh tells R29, “Some studies suggest [that these] fragrance ingredients may mimic hormones,” basically acting like hormones in the body, “but this isn’t the same as disrupting them.” What’s important, adds Ghosh, is that most lab-based studies tend to use perfume ingredient doses far higher than what you’d ever spritz on your skin in real life. Scott agrees, adding that it’s the dose that determines the risk: “Fragrances are usually included in formulations at under 1%, with phthalates potentially present in even smaller amounts,” she says. Scott points out that giving 100% of these ingredients to study subjects (often not humans) would clearly lead to inflated data that doesn’t match the actual concentration in perfume formulas. Since these ingredients are used in such tiny concentrations in perfumes, they’re considered safe for humans, says Ghosh. Who determines the safety of perfume ingredients? Reassuringly, Ghosh says that fragrance safety isn’t a solo mission — it’s a global collaboration: “The International Fragrance Association (IFRA) is an independent global organisation that sets rules for using fragrance ingredients safely, based on research from the non-profit group, Research Institute for Fragrance Materials (RIFM).” This institute conducts safety assessments, which are then reviewed by an additional independent expert panel for fragrance safety. Their deep dive covers substances that can harm fertility or the development of an unborn child, as well as other health concerns such as skin irritation, sensitization, and carcinogenicity (the ability to cause cancer).  Ghosh explains that the International Fragrance Association takes all this data and creates its globally recognized standards: “These ban or restrict certain ingredients to ensure consumer safety,” says Ghosh. In fact, a handful of perfume ingredients flagged as risky — like certain phthalates — have already been restricted or banned in many countries, says Ghosh. “With 80% of global fragrances complying, it’s one of beauty’s most robust safety nets,” she adds. “This means you can trust that big brands are sourcing fragrances designed with your safety in mind.” ‘When brands purchase fragrances, they’re already compliant with the latest science,’ says registered toxicologist Rani Ghosh. With that in mind, you’re most certainly already using safe perfumes. Are all perfume brands safe to use? Ghosh says that you can rest assured that the top fragrance houses, which supply perfume blends to cosmetics manufacturers, all adhere to these standards: “When brands purchase fragrances, they’re already compliant with the latest science,” she explains. With that in mind, you’re most certainly already using safe perfumes. If you live in the US, there’s an extra safety net, says Scott. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is beginning to tighten up its regulations with the introduction of the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act. “This requires brands to identify any fragrance allergens in the ingredient declaration,” says Scott, but she adds that ingredients used in cosmetics have always been required to be safe for the intended use. Can perfume be absorbed into the body and disrupt your hormones? Besides those regulatory bodies keeping an eye on things, Ghosh points out that your skin is pretty great at shielding you from most chemicals, including fragrances. She mentions the 500 Dalton rule, a guideline in cosmetic and skincare formulation that relates to how ingredients are absorbed through the skin. “According to this rule, molecules larger than 500 daltons struggle to penetrate the skin barrier — and most fragrance ingredients fall into this category,” says Ghosh. “This means they stay on the surface where they belong rather than entering your bloodstream in significant amounts.” Considering that perfume is applied topically, rather than ingested or injected, this greatly limits your exposure, confirms Scott: “A healthy skin barrier does a great job at keeping things out of our systems,” she says. Cosmetics regulators aren’t just looking at one bottle on your shelf — they’re thinking about the big picture, accounting for “aggregate exposure,” says Ghosh, which is much of a chemical you’re exposed to across all products you use. “Even if you use over 12 fragranced products daily, these [regulations] ensure you stay well below any risk thresholds thanks to conservative limits,” she says.  Natural or essential oil-based fragrances aren’t inherently safer. Essential oils, like citrus oils, are particularly highly concentrated and can contain allergens and irritants.Rani Ghosh, registered toxicologist Do certain perfumes pose more of a risk than others? Out of the thousands of ingredients that make a perfume, only a small handful ever raise eyebrows, says Ghosh. “Those ingredients are tightly controlled or replaced with safer alternatives, and while social media might amplify these risks, evidence-based regulation ensures your perfume is safe without the drama.” So while TikTok might be in a panic, your signature scent, as long as it’s from a reputable brand, is in the clear. Are natural or essential oil perfumes better for you? If TikTok is anything to go by, “natural” or essential oil-based perfumes are better for you than those containing chemicals like phthalates. But the experts say that this is a huge misconception: “Natural or essential oil-based fragrances aren’t inherently safer,” says Ghosh. Essential oils, like citrus oils, are particularly highly concentrated and can contain allergens and irritants. “These can cause [skin] reactions in sunlight,” explains Ghosh, like redness, burning, blistering, and, eventually, hyperpigmentation.  Unlike lab-made perfume ingredients, natural oils are a bit unpredictable and can vary wildly in composition, which makes them trickier to control for safety. The bottom line? Whether an ingredient is natural or synthetic, what matters is a smart formulation and solid regulation, not where it came from. Can you still use your perfume? Unlike the often boldly displayed cruelty-free symbol, perfumes don’t usually highlight that they’re IFRA compliant, says Ghosh, but she’s all for celebrating fragrance as a form of joy and self-expression: “Don’t let fear take that away!” she stresses. “Rest assured that decades of research and regulation have gone into ensuring your favorite scents are both indulgent and safe to use daily.” If you’re still concerned, Ghosh advises applying your perfume sparingly or focusing on your pulse points. “But know the science has been taken care of,” she reassures.

    "description": "You know when you have two friends from different groups finally for the first time, and you (being the common link) knew they would get along? Learning about Amika’s new collab with indie fragrance brand Ellis Brooklyn felt exactly like that — but in beauty product form.  For starters, both brands have roots in NYC, and as I chat with both Shapiro and Amika CEO Chelsea Riggs, it’s immediately clear this isn’t just another beauty collab — it’s a friendship. (“Amika” actually means “friend” in Esperanto, the world’s most popular international auxiliary language.) The fact that I also happened to find the dry shampoo I’ll be using nonstop this summer? A total bonus. “Perk Up has been in the market for almost 15 years, and it’s also ranked as the number-one premium dry shampoo,” Riggs tells Refinery29. “We knew we wanted to have a moment for that, and fragrance was where we wanted to lean in.” Ellis Brooklyn was a natural fit; during our conversation, Ellis Brooklyn founder Bee Shapiro shared that she was a former client of Amika’s (sadly, now closed) salon in Williamsburg. Kismet! Amika x Ellis Brooklyn Miami Nectar Perk Up Dry Shampoo, $28 Just in time for summer, Amika has reimagined its bestselling Perk Up Dry Shampoo with the scent of Ellis Brooklyn’s Miami Nectar. The result? The same instantly refreshing dry shampoo, now with tropical notes of pink pineapple, coconut water, and amber. “We tested a bunch of different fragrances that Bee and the team sent, and I really thought we were going to end up with Sun Fruit, given the color and it feeling very Amika,” Riggs shares, adding that it was a lab sample of (then-unreleased) Miami Nectar that wont the team over. “It smelled as if Amika had gone to the beach.” But this sun-soaked version of Perk Up isn’t just a way to refresh your roots and add a boost of volume; it’s an invitation to layer your fragrance for a unique blend of good smells. I’ve been using it nonstop in my hair, adding a floral scent like Aesop’s new Aurner Eau de Parfum when I’m feeling more feminine, or leaning more into the warm, woody notes by wearing something like Le Monde Gourmand’s Santal Supreme. DashDividers_1_500x100  “We were thinking about what exactly is ‘functional fragrance?’” Shapiro tells me. “And at the end of the day, what’s more functional than my favorite dry shampoo with our amazing scent?” While Amika products are already beloved for their fruity-floral scents, Shapiro says this limited-edition collaboration was a chance to take things to a whole new level. “There are already amazing scents in hair, but we’re coming at it with a little bit more complexity [with this launch],” she adds. Miami Nectar Perk Up retails for $28 (the same as a full size of OG Perk Up), and is available at Sephora, as well as Amika and Ellis Brooklyn‘s respective websites. If you’re not already using Amika products, chances are you could spot a brightly-colored, patterned can from across the room and know it was the brand’s. A closer look at the packaging reveals Easter eggs that nod to the fragrance (coconuts, pineapples, groovy florals) and Miami’s sun-and-fun lifestyle (pool slides, ice cream cones, seashells, and even a few dolphins). In the few weeks since I received an early sample to test, I’ve been using it nonstop — after workouts, to add texture to my style, or simply as hair perfume. (BTW, I’m a dark brunette, and this stuff disappears into my roots without a trace.) I was already a fan of Ellis Brooklyn’s Miami Nectar fragrance (especially as someone living in Miami) and Amika’s dry shampoo, so to have them combined into one? Nothing less than a match made in beauty heaven. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/lyma-laser-review-49307232",
    "description": "At-home LED red light therapy devices have skyrocketed in popularity over the past several years, becoming an integral part of many people's skin-care routines. They're safe, easy to use, accessible, and known to help with the production of collagen, skin tone and texture, and fine lines and wrinkles. Despite the benefits, these at-home tools tend to be more of a slow burn and can't quite compare to in-office laser technologies. Enter Lyma Laser ($2,695) the the new Lyma Laser Pro ($5,995), the first handheld medical-grade device that promises professional results - safely, from the comfort of your home. Since receiving FDA clearance for the original in May 2022, this groundbreaking at-home device has gone viral on social media. Founded by Lucy Goff, the technology has been backed by years of research and engineering for safe at-home use. Though it's seen its share of skeptics on social media, it's nevertheless garnered a dedicated celebrity following and endorsement from top skin-care experts such as master aesthetician Joanna Czech and dermatologist Dendy Engelman, MD, who are dedicated users of Lyma Laser themselves. \"One of my favorite things about the Lyma Laser is how practical, low-maintenance, and easy it is to use on your own time,\" Dr. Engelman says. \"I love that you can use it in your home and that it works from head to toe. It is more powerful than at-home LED devices and targets wrinkles, texture, tone, and elasticity.\" Keep reading for everything else you need to know about the technology and my full experience trying it out. Experts Featured in This Article Lucy Goff is the founder of Lyma. Dendy Engelman, MD, is a New York City dermatologist at Shafer Clinic. Joanna Czech is a master aesthetician based in New York City. How the Lyma Laser Works The laser itself is a portable, six-inch-long cylindrical device with an on-off button at the opposite end of the laser that appears nonthreatening, considering its power. It utilizes low level laser therapy (LLLT) or near infrared laser light technology that helps to remodel and rebuild skin without causing damage to skin cells in the process. \"It was originally developed for the medical industry by scientists developing a medical laser who found amazing results on transforming wrinkles, pigmentation, and scars,\" Dr. Engelman says. Inside the device, there are two patented internal diffusers that fragment the near infrared light into 25,000 smaller beams, operating at 500mW power at the 808nm wavelength. \"The laser light activates fibroblasts, encouraging cells to recharge and regenerate, increasing collagen and elastin production,\" Dr. Engelman says. The light energy reaches the deepest layers of the skin but also into the fat and muscle tissue beneath the surface. Despite this, the treatment is painless, causes no irritation to the skin, and is incredibly easy to use - leaving little to no risk of the average person using the device to overdo it. Comparatively, in-office laser rejuvenation works by inducing a stress/damage response, essentially inflicting injury to the skin in order to stimulate collagen, Goff explains. Dr. Engelman adds, \"Lyma offers many benefits to the skin because it triggers the skin cells to recharge, regenerate, and repair, instead of dying off like traditional lasers.\" The technology \"switches\" your cells from the degeneration process to the regeneration process. For best results, it's recommended that you use the device for three to 15 minutes daily over the desired treated area, such as the entire face, for 12 weeks. If there's a particular area on your face that you're looking to treat, such as crow's feet, it's instructed that you hold the laser still on that area for three minutes, then move on to the next area you wish to treat. Lyma Laser Benefits Czech not only uses the Lyma Laser on herself but also on her clients during facial sessions. \"The Lyma is great [at reducing] inflammation; I've had clients use it on their scars as well,\" she says. \"When it comes to at-home treatments and technology, ease of use plays a huge factor. I call it Netflix-friendly; you can use it while in bed or pack it easily in your carry-on.\" Depending on your personal skin-care goals, Lyma Laser can be used for both prevention and also rejuvenation. \"It [works especially well on] mature skin, sensitive skin, blemish-prone skin, and dry skin,\" Dr. Engelman says. The laser treats a multitude of concerns, from signs of aging - like fine lines, wrinkles, sagging, and loss of volume - to pigmentation, acne scarring, spider veins, and bruises. \"One of my favorite tricks is to use it on my arms as well,\" Czech says. Lyma Laser vs Lyma Laser Pro The Lyma Laser launched in 2020 while the Lyma Laser Pro just hit shelves in 2025. The biggest difference between the original and the pro is the size and power. The Lyma Laser is smaller in size with a 8cm² treatment lens while the Pro is 30cm² big, allowing you to treat a larger area. Otherwise, the rest of the features of the device are the same. How to Use the Lyma Laser The device requires four hours of charging and, if used as instructed, requires charging once a week. Once the device is charged, fully cleanse your face (or double cleanse if necessary), then \"apply an emollient serum or cream so the laser is able to glide more smoothly without tugging the skin,\" Dr. Engelman says. If you're not keen on using the Lyma-branded products that come in the starter kit (like the Lyma Oxygen Mist and Glide), Czech says she loves to apply all of her favorite serums before using the laser, including the Joanna Czech Skincare The Soothing Serum ($275) and The C + Serum ($340). Goff says you can use any product with the laser and follow your normal skin-care routine as usual, including vitamin C, retinol, and SPF - there are no contraindications. Without pressing the device too hard against your skin, slowly glide the laser upward and outward all over your face - from your chin to the outer edge of your jaw, under your cheekbones, up to your temples, and across your forehead. If you're using it on your neck, glide the laser in upward strokes. As mentioned, if there's a particular area you want to focus on (i.e. crow's feet or the 11 lines) or you have a scar or pigmentation spot, hold the laser over that area for three minutes a day. Goff says that after two weeks, you should see improvement in your skin, but to continue daily use for 12 weeks. If you're wanting to use the Lyma Oxygen Mist and Glide, the products deliver pure oxygen into the skin to increase the results of the laser, allowing it to glide seamlessly. If so, Goff recommends cleansing your face as usual, applying six pumps of the mist to the area followed by six pumps of the serum, then moving it across your skin. Dampen the Lyma sponge (which is also included in the starter kit) in water, and carefully remove the product in circular motions. Rinse, then continue with your normal skin-care routine. Though the laser has to be used as recommended for full efficacy, results are still immediate. \"Many people notice almost immediate results in reducing redness and mild flare-ups,\" Dr. Engelman says. Lyma Laser Results I rarely get as excited about trying something as when I received the Lyma Laser and started using it at home. Its reputation had preceded it, and I was sold on the endorsements alone. Lyma Laser is hands down one of the easiest and most comfortable at-home devices I've tried. It really was as simple as me cleansing and applying my entire skin-care routine, topping it off with my favorite oil to help the device glide easily, pouring myself a glass of wine, and very slowly moving the laser all over my face. I would hold for three minutes on each side at my crow's feet and then at the corners of my mouth, hoping for an eventual lift. When I initially started using the laser, I had finished a three-month course of oral tranexamic acid to treat my melasma, so my overall goal (aside from building collagen and treating fine lines) was to keep my melasma or any other dark spots on my face from reappearing. I've been using it consistently for about three weeks, and my skin has remained mark-free and looks less red or inflamed overall. I also noticed that it helped clear up two extremely noticeable blemishes on my cheek after a day or two, which I'm assuming would not have cleared up as quickly if not for the laser. Is the Lyma Laser Worth the Splurge? With a price tag of $2,695 for the original, and $5,995 for the Lyma Laser Pro, it's not cheap. Though its benefits are worth the price tag when you consider the costs of an in-office laser treatment, which can run you thousands of dollars for several sessions, making the Lyma Laser a good investment. The device comes with a two-year full replacement warranty, and you can expect the device to last you about 10 years, according to the brand's website. \"It is an investment, but the clinic-grade technology delivers a multitude of benefits. Lyma's low-level laser therapy delivers in-office results but at home. Given the longevity of the device and the medical-quality results, it is a cost-effective option,\" Dr. Engelman says.

    "description": "Image Source: Getty/Gareth Cattermole/TAS24 When the cat-eye is sharp enough to kill a man, you better believe we're going to wonder what eyeliner was used to create it. Taylor Swift's makeup choices have long been the topic of fan conversation, and it's easy to see why. The \"Vigilante\" singer performs her epic stadium shows rain or shine, and even in the worst weather, her makeup never bleeds. Is she specifically anointed by the beauty gods so that she never has to deal with a streak or smudge? Maybe, but it also may have something to do with the products she relies on. We already tracked down Swift's red lipstick, which is a well-known signature of hers, but what about her go-to eyeliner? It turns out she keeps a few in her rotation. Let's start with the most notable eyeliner she's worn: Pat McGrath's Perma Precision Liquid Eyeliner ($36) in Xtreme Black. Why is this notable, you ask? Well, Swift actually starred in the brand's campaign for the product back in 2022. Image Source: Robyn BECK / AFP Since McGrath and Swift have had a long-standing relationship, it's fair to say this is still one of her favorite picks. It's known for having the perfect velvet-matte finish, staying put (through hours of Eras tours) for up to 12 hours, and being both waterproof and smudge proof. Whether you're performing for tens of thousands of people or just heading out for drinks on a Friday night, an eyeliner that stays on is an absolute necessity. In addition to the McGrath liner, Swift appears to have another favorite in her makeup bag. In the \"Miss Americana\" documentary that came out on Netflix in 2020, there's a scene where the singer is applying her own eyeliner. Eagle-eyed fan and beauty expert Kristina Rodulfo identified it as the Tom Ford Eye Defining Liquid Liner Pen ($65). While this one is on the pricier side, you can't beat the fact that it's Swift-approved. Both the Pat McGrath and Tom Ford picks are great options to replicate Swift's \"sharp enough\" cat-eye.
