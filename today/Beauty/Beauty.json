    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rhode-peptide-lip-shape-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "In some ways, lip pencils are the new lip oil — in other words, they’re everywhere right now — and one need only look to your nearest group chat where girlies are dropping the lip combos left, right, and center. And while it seems every brand has its version of a humble lip pencil, if one brand can manage to break through the crowded landscape, it’s Rhode.  The Hailey Bieber-founded brand was founded with a core system of skincare products, but has gradually branched into makeup in their own unique, Rhode way with the arrival of Peptide Lip Tint (tinted versions of the brand’s bestselling Peptide Lip Treatment) as well as Pocket Blush, a creamy stick blush that picked up a 2024 MVP Award from yours truly. Point is, I for one have yet to try a product from the brand that I didn’t genuinely love, and as such, the team and I had lofty expectations for Peptide Lip Shape. Peptide Lip Shape delivers soft-focus pigment in a creamy, hydrating formula with a satiny matte finish. It comes in 10 shades ranging from baby pink to caramel beige to chocolate brown. And as the name suggests, peptides are a hero ingredient and work wonders to help hydrate and soften lips – which many of us can certainly appreciate during this arid time of year. Secondly, there’s fenugreek extract, derived from leafy sprouts of the same name, which has a natural lip-plumping effect sans tingling or burning. You can shop Peptide Lip Shape for $24 each, or create a quartet of your four favorite shades for $92. Below, keep reading for our beauty editors’ unfiltered thoughts on the buzzy new drop. DashDividers_1_500x100 Rhode Peptide Lip Shape, $24 DashDividers_1_500x100 Shade(s) tested: Press, Lunge, Balance, Twist  Review: Fans of Rhode and Hailey Bieber have been eagerly anticipating this launch ever since Hailey teased a version of it on Instagram over a year ago. It’s the product most closely associated with her—second only to her beloved Peptide Lip Tint. So when she finally introduced Peptide Lip Shape, a lip liner-meets-lipstick hybrid, expectations were sky-high—including mine. And it did not disappoint. Peptide Lip Shape checks every box for the perfect lip liner: pigmented, creamy, and hydrating. It glides effortlessly across my typically dry lips, blending seamlessly to create an effortless, natural-looking pout—the kind that makes you wonder, Is that her real lip color? While I appreciate the silicone smudger tip on the other end, I find it easier to just use my finger for blending. As for shades, I’m partial to Press and Lunge since I love mauves and rose tones, but Balance and Twist deliver that quintessential ‘90s mocha mousse lip that I can’t resist. Top it with your favorite lip gloss and prepare for the compliments to roll in.” — Sara Tan, Global Beauty Director DashDividers_1_500x100 Shade(s) tested: Lunge, balance, twist, lean Review: Hailey’s love of another viral lip pencil (Make Up For Ever’s Artist Color Pencil in Anywhere Caffeine and Wherever Walnut) is well documented, but Rhode’s version is no copycat; unlike a traditional liner formula, Peptide Lip Shape is creamy and glides on like a crayon, with a blurred, diffused finish. It’s not super opaque, and that’s the point. I tried a variety of brownish-nude shades that suited my olive skin tone, ranging from slightly rosy to mocha. The finish is truly a “my lips but better” effect, and feels very Rhode – effortlessly chic and natural. The product itself is soft enough that I honestly could take or leave the silicone smudger end; it’s meant to blend and blur the product onto lips but I found that it ended up rubbing some of it off instead. I love wearing it alone or layered under a glossy lip balm (which Rhode also has mastered, clever them!) for extra shine.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer DashDividers_1_500x100 Shade(s) tested: Lunge, Press  Review: I’ve tried hundreds of lip liners as a beauty director but I’ve never been more excited to try Peptide Lip Shape. Perhaps it’s the clever marketing, or that Hailey has an incredible Cupid’s bow. Either way, I got my hands on them fast. I reached straight for Bend, which Rhode describes as a “soft peachy beige”, but as soon as I opened the lid, the stick of liner fell out. I had the same issue with Refy’s Blur Liner, which boasts similar plastic packaging. Thankfully, this wasn’t an issue with Press and Lunge, which I’m wearing here. The texture is silky smooth and glided over my dry lips with ease. Because it’s so creamy, though, the staying power isn’t as great as I’d hoped, but it’s very easy to apply. So much so I rarely enlist a mirror when I’m topping up on the go! While I appreciate the addition of a smudger on the end, I found that it just removed the product from my lips. Fingers are a much better tool for achieving that blurred lip effect. Seeing as the formula is so moisturising, it has earned a place in my makeup bag for winter, but during spring and summer, when I want my lip liner to last — like really last — I’ll go back to Glossier’s Lip Line Enhancing Pen.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director DashDividers_1_500x100 Shade(s) tested: Press, Lean “Lip Shape has turned me into a Rhode convert. I’m a relative latecomer when it comes to the brand — I’ve found the social media hype quite intense at times — but after testing out this new launch, in the shades Press and Lean, I can see why the brand nabbed home a R29 Beauty Innovator Award last year. I’m normally quite intimidated by lip liners, as I find the art of overlining difficult to master. Lip Shape’s creamy formula and wide, rounded tip make it oh-so-easy, though. There’s zero dragging or skipping; just silky-smooth application that makes outlining your lips feel like applying a layer of lip balm. The skin-conditioning ingredients, namely peptides and fenugreek extract, keeps my lips supple and firm all day without creating any dry lines (although it’s worth noting that some people with nut allergies can react to fenugreek, just FYI). The brand recommends using the silicone tip to blend inwards for a more natural, diffused effect, but I personally found that easier to achieve with my finger tips. What really had me hooked was its staying power: my lip liner stayed put throughout my lunch break and coffee run, and five-course dinner, with little need to reapply. I’ve been gravitating towards Lean, a medium brown, with a thin layer of the Rhode Peptide Lip Tint in Espresso for a ‘90s-inspired look. I also love Press, which gives my lips a head-turning rosy glow.” – Venus Wong, Senior Writer DashDividers_1_500x100 Shade(s) tested: Stretch, Spin, Flex, and Move “I’ve been experiencing a bit of beauty burnout lately, finding excitement in only a handful of launches. However, something about Rhode’s Peptide Lip Shape particularly intrigued me. “Each shade is incredibly pigmented, creamy and effortlessly glides along the natural lip line. I’ve found that many beauty products often look completely different from how they appear on a brand’s website or even on the packaging, but this range looks exactly the same IRL. As for the silicone smudger, I was initially certain I’d barely use it, but it has been a dream for tidying up unruly smudges. It won’t completely replace blending with my fingertips, but for on-the-go application, it’s exactly what I need. I found each shade to be long-lasting, with a good few hours of wear. “As a Black woman, finding a good variety of brown lip liners isn’t as easy as people think. Often, you have to resort to an eyeliner to get a brown that actually shows up on your lips or doesn’t look ashy. It’s great to see Rhode paving the way for inclusive and fun lip liner shades. I’ve become particularly obsessed with Stretch (a neutral mocha brown), Spin (a rich plum brown) and Flex (a rich neutral brown), as they complement my lips beautifully. Each one is a distinct shade of brown and looks effortlessly cool. Move (a deep cool brown) was the only shade I didn’t particularly warm to as it was just a bit darker than I prefer, but it’s still nice to have variety.” — Vanese Maddix, Freelance Writer Like what you see?

While some beauty trends are all about making a statement, the manicures that have been all over my feed this year are simple, understated and pared-back. Take soap nails, pixie dust manicures or micro nail art, for example, all of which whisper rather than shout. The latest manicure trend to emerge is just as sophisticated, but there’s a little more edge to it. Enter: “Angel” chrome nails. View this post on Instagram A post shared by San Sung Kim | 김산성 (@sansungnails) What are angel chrome nails? Coined by nail artist San Sung Kim, angel chrome typically consists of a nude base — similar to that of soap nails. It then enlists a cat eye gel polish with magnetic particles to create a glassy finish and is topped with a dusting of chrome in the centre. Kim’s viral creation isn’t the only iteration. Clara Clarissa Rianto‘s version boasts silver cat eye polish with a slick of chrome at the very tip of the nail. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Clara Clarissa Rianto (@cclaracr) “Angel chrome nails are a soft, ethereal take on chrome nails, featuring a dreamy, pearlescent glow with a delicate, almost angelic sheen,” explains pro nail artist Jessica White. Created by layering a few different polishes, angel chrome nails tend to use a soft color palette with a hint of shimmer. “They usually have an opalescent or milky white base with a reflective, iridescent chrome powder layered on top, giving them a luminous, otherworldly effect,” says White. Some nail artists are also referring to the trend as “aurora” nails because the finish often resembles the glimmering Aurora Borealis. Just like the other subtle nail art that’s proving popular right now, angel chrome nails are all about embracing a color palette of pretty neutrals and soft pastels. The difference between a finish like this and something like a nail tint is the finish: ultra-shiny, slightly metallic and deliciously glossy, almost as though your natural nails have been dipped in pearls. @lostcherrybunny @✧˖° ally🐰ྀི i love cat eye sm 😭 #chromenails #cateyenails #gelx #nailart #nailtutorial ♬ ABCD – NAYEON How do you create angel chrome nails? Much of the inspiration that I’ve spotted online has been gel manicures, and White points out that this is because a professional chrome powder application over gel lends the most intense effect. Plus, magnetic cat eye polish is usually a gel. Happily, it is also possible to recreate a similar look at home. “Start with a sheer, milky white or soft pink base coat, then apply a pearlescent or iridescent top coat to create that signature glow,” White explains. She recommends OPI Funny Bunny, $11.99, a soft milky white, with OPI Kyoto Pearl, $11.99, a shimmery shade, layered on top to create “the classic angel chrome look with a pure, heavenly glow” at home. To enhance that glassy, three-dimensional look and to help the iridescent colors beneath pop, finish with a high-shine glossy top coat like Essie Gel Couture Gel Top Coat, $13. Alternatively, if you want a speedy alternative to layering up polishes then White suggests using one of the brilliant chrome-effect nail polishes on the market instead. Nails Inc. Better On Top, $9, and Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Nail Polish in Let’s Get Digital, $12.99, are two great options. @itsalifestylenails Replying to @bannabrii I hope this tutorial makes you want to try out this cat eye look!

    "title": "I Tried Nailboo's Dip Kit, and It's Worth the Hype",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/nailboo-dip-manicure-review-48231299",
    "description": "In its never-ending quest to sell me trendy beauty products, Instagram has been sliding Nailboo into my feed for the better part of a year. The dip powder manicure kit has become wildly popular for two reasons: DIY nails have been on the rise thanks to the popularity of social media sites like TikTok, and the ability to do said nails at home continues to get easier and easier. So, if you've been searching for a detailed Nailboo review, look no further. After testing it out, I've learned this is one of the easiest at-home dip kits for beginners (and trust me, I've tried lots of options). Unlike some more advanced kits, Nailboo is made expressly for those who aren't quite sure how to dip from home or maybe don't know how to dip at all - perhaps because they've never even gotten a professional dip manicure - by simplifying the complex process with labeled products and step-by-step instructions. DIY manicures beyond the average two coats of nail polish can either end in disappointment or turn out rather decent. Either way, doing it yourself saves you money on biweekly fill-ins and the occasional broken nail replacement. So, just how easy is this system and is it worth throwing down $55 (and up) for a starter kit?

    "description": "Nail lovers know that manicures typically fall into one of two categories: minimalist or maximalist. Maximalists have conversation starters like coquette nails and \"junk\" nails; minimalists have classics like french tips and \"rich girl\" nails. It's rare that we come across a trend that fits into both categories - but it does happen. Allow us to introduce you to your new favorite manicure: \"denim\" nails. Fashion trends have a habit of influencing what's hot in the beauty world, and the latest nail obsession is no exception. As the name suggests, the trend is inspired by none other than - yep, you guessed it - your favorite pair of jeans. It's gaining popularity because of how customizable it is - whether you opt for something as simple a light wash or if you want to go all out with rips and fading, trust us - there's a denim nail look for you. Keep scrolling to learn more about the nail trend and find out how to re-create the look at home. Experts Featured in This Article Olivia Aguirre is the lead nail artist for Côte Beauty. Olive Van Iderstine is nail-care brand Olive and June's manicure trend expert. Rianna Basurto is the director of marketing and brand development at Bellacures. Elle Gerstein is a celebrity nail artist located in New York City. Sonya Meesh is a celebrity nail artist. What Are Denim Nails? \"Denim nails are a trendy nail design that mimics the look and texture of denim fabric,\" Rianna Basurto of Bellacures says. \"They can range from deep indigo shades to soft, acid-wash blues, often with subtle distressing, fading, or even stitch-like details to resemble real jeans.\" There are variations that opt for matte finishes in order to get a true fabric effect, but a glossy or metallic sheen is also perfect for the trend. The fun thing about denim nails is that they're a bit of a choose-your-own adventure. You can opt for a manicure that looks like you'd be wearing it on your bottom half or you can choose the more pared down version that incorporates different shades of blue. The good news? Denim nails are truly versatile. \"Just as jeans are a classic wardrobe staple that never goes out of style and look good on everyone, the same can be said for denim nails,\" nail expert Olivia Van Iderstine says. However, there are a few guidelines. \"The ripped style is usually applied to a longer nail but the solid denim colors work on shorter nails as well,\" celebrity nail artist Sonya Meesh says. How to Get Denim Nails The first step is deciding which take on the denim nail trend you want to recreate. This is where inspiration photos come in handy. Once you have reference photos, you'll want to make sure your manicure begins with the proper nail prep. Whether you're DIY-ing the look at home or visiting a salon, freshly filed nails with pushed back nail beds are key. If you're looking to do it yourself, the simplest way to do it is to start with a blue nail polish. Luckily, there are plenty different options to choose from. Some of our experts' favorites include Olive and June's CNH ($9) and Dior 796 Denim ($32). From there, you can choose to add embellishments, stitching, or rips using a nail art brush - or you can keep things simple with a single-color manicure. \"To create the denim texture, dab a makeup sponge into white or light blue polish and lightly press it onto the nails to create a faded, textured effect,\" celebrity nail artist Elle Gerstein says. \"Alternatively, use a fan brush to streak thin, uneven white lines across the nails for a woven fabric look.\" If you don't have time for a nail appointment or to swipe on polish at home, you can always opt for press-on nails. The Olive and June OMG Glue Press-Ons ($10) are the perfect indigo color to get the look quickly. One last thing to note? \"Something that's really important and often overlooked in making your manicure look great is healthy, hydrated skin - I rely on the Côte Beauty's Hand \u0026 Body Lotion ($52) to help make my manicure look its best every day,\" nail artist Olivia Aguirre says. \"Hydrated nails also help to prevent chips and keep your manicure looking fresher for longer.\" Ready to get that salon appointment booked or tackle the look on your own?
