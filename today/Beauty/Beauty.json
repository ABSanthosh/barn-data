If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. In April 2021, when most coronavirus restrictions had been lifted and we rejoiced in our newfound freedom, the first thing I did was book into my local salon for a bob haircut. Lopping off five inches became something of a metaphor for shedding the past and starting afresh. Ever since then, the bob has been my hairstyle du jour.  I’ve rocked the “bottleneck” bob (so named for its face-framing fringe), the Italian bob (characterized by volume and chunky, blunt ends) and even the “boyfriend” bob (arguably the shortest — and, surprisingly, most controversial — of the bunch). But last June, as I grappled with the straighteners for the umpteenth time (bobs are high maintenance, you know), I decided on a new hair goal: to grow my hair long and strong so that I didn’t have to put as much heat on it, or style it constantly. It grew at a snail’s pace. No matter how many spiky silicone head massagers I collected, or how enthusiastically my beauty editor peers recommended biotin supplements (more on why I chose not to heed their advice later), my hair wouldn’t pass my shoulders for what felt like forever. In a bid to find out what was going on, I reached out to various hair experts, even paying a visit to the Philip Kingsley Trichological Clinic for a hair scan with trichologist Anabel Kingsley. What I learned transformed my hair-care regime as I knew it, and by December my hair had grown a little over five inches. Fast-forward to this month and my friends, family and colleagues can’t get over how quickly and effortlessly my hair seems to have sprouted. I won’t gatekeep. This is everything the professionals taught me about growing longer, stronger and healthier hair — and how to apply it to your own routine. I wash my hair more often Unsurprisingly, the TikTok-viral concept of “hair training” — leaving your hair longer in between washes in the hope that your scalp produces less oil over time — is unfounded. Previously, I’d wash my hair once or twice a week, thinking that eking out my wash days would preserve the integrity of my strands. But the trichologists I spoke to hinted that I was probably doing more harm to my growth cycle than good.  In fact, not washing my hair regularly enough resulted in seborrheic dermatitis: an inflammatory condition that makes the scalp itchy and results in yellow, sticky flakes. Like dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis is caused by a common yeast called malassezia, and while this yeast is entirely normal, an oily environment causes it to multiply and wreak havoc on the scalp. “As seborrheic dermatitis causes an imbalance, the hair can shed more quickly as it doesn’t have the best growing conditions,” says Eva Proudman, a consultant trichologist at UK Hair Consultants. She explains that hair washing is more about cleansing the scalp — which is simply an extension of the face — than just the hair. “The scalp has 180,000 oil glands and these can, at different times in our lives, become more active and produce more oil,” says Proudman, hence the propensity for scalp imbalance. She continues, “The scalp is the growing medium of the hair and needs to be balanced for optimum hair growth and hair health.”  Trichologist Anabel Kingsley agrees. She told me previously: “The flaking of the scalp increases daily hair fall and impacts the integrity of the cuticle [the outermost layer of the hair strand], causing the growth of weaker hair.” To Kingsley, the scalp is your hair’s “home” and if it’s in bad condition, it’ll impact how your hair is able to grow.  Of course, how often you wash your hair is down to personal preference but Proudman says that an ideal washing regime is every day or every other day for optimum scalp balance and hair growth conditions. (I opt for the latter.) Those with curly, coily and kinky hair might want to stretch this to once a week. I made my scalp the priority I thought I knew how to wash my hair but I was schooled during a hair spa treatment at Kingsley’s clinic, where an expert scrubbed my scalp for three minutes. They also focused less on my lengths. Since then, I’ve done the same for every wash, and I’m convinced that the exfoliating motion is keeping my flakes at bay. Interestingly, Proudman adds that consistent scalp massage can stimulate blood flow into the hair follicle to support hair growth.  Seeing as I wash my hair more regularly now, I find that one wash is enough. “Double cleansing your hair is generally only needed if you use lots of products or if you have a very oily scalp,” says Proudman. I just use a generous amount of shampoo to create a substantial lather and make sure that my hair is soaking wet first.  While I wash my scalp more regularly now, I avoid putting conditioner and hair oils on my roots. Instead, and as suggested by Kingsley, I concentrate these to my mid-lengths and ends, which need the most moisture. Since doing so, I’ve realized that bombarding my scalp with thick products like these was only making it greasier and likely contributed to my flaky and itchy symptoms. Kingsley confirmed my suspicion. “It’s not necessary to put conditioner on roots,” she told me. “It can weigh the hair down and if it contains oils it could potentially exacerbate seborrheic dermatitis.” Though this worked for me, all hair types are different. Your roots might be particularly dry and require more moisture in the form of conditioner, masks, oils and other treatments of your choice. I discovered the smartest shampoo I’ve always been skeptical about hair growth shampoos. How can something that’s only on your scalp for a few minutes at a time possibly have an impact on your strands? Happily, I was proven wrong when I discovered Typebea. Anna Lahey (founder of supplement brand Vida Glow) and Rita Ora (yes, really) are the brains behind the beauty editor-adored G1 Overnight Boosting Peptide Serum, $52, and G2 Strength \u0026 Length Shampoo, $, and Conditioner, $26. I’m convinced all three have helped my hair grow longer and stronger.  It’s all in the ingredients. First up is baicapil, which Proudman explains is a plant-based ingredient (a combination of wheat sprouts and soybean) and is often used in hair products. Lahey reports that it’s clinically proven to boost growth and reduce hair loss by 60%. There are a small handful of studies that suggest baicapil is an effective hair growth treatment. According to Lahey, baicapil has the power to improve hair density, strengthen follicles and enhance scalp health, resulting in thicker, more resilient lengths over time.  Then there’s salicylic acid. “This gently exfoliates the scalp, removing dead skin cells, product and oil buildup, and balancing oil production,” says Lahey. Proudman adds that salicylic acid keeps the hair follicles clear, which supports healthy hair growth. Lastly, the shampoo and scalp serum boast provitamin B5 aka panthenol to moisturize the hair and keep that moisture under lock and key. Proudman says that provitamin B5 also “smooths the hair to give a good shine and protection from damage”.  All of these ingredients have been studied and can provide benefits to the hair and scalp, continues Proudman, but she adds that it’s important to note that the formulation — and amount of these ingredients — determines how effective a product will be. In my honest opinion as a beauty director who has tried my fair share of hair growth products, Typebea’s are the only ones that have worked for me. When I rinse away the Strength \u0026 Length Shampoo and wring out the water, it’s like it has worked magic to beef up my strands. Not only is my hair longer but it feels twice as thick. I’ve been through a handful of bottles of the shampoo and conditioner in particular — and I’m already stocking up on more.  I used minoxidil — but consistency is key If you’re still skeptical about hair growth shampoos and serums, and you’re experiencing hair loss or thinning in particular, you might want to consider trying minoxidil: a proven treatment for androgenetic alopecia (hair loss caused by a combination of genetics and hormones). “Minoxidil is a vasodilator that pulls blood flow into the hair follicle,” explains Proudman. “It stimulates the hair follicles to enter into the growing phase and remain there for longer.” Minoxidil also increases the diameter of the hair, says Proudman, improving overall hair density on the scalp. For full disclosure, I used Rogaine (an over-the-counter version of minoxidil) every day for three weeks last August, concentrating the product to a sparse patch on my left temple. But consistency is key. “It can take three to six months to see the effects of minoxidil,” says Proudman, “and it needs to be applied to the scalp, not the hair, consistently as advised.”  When I discovered Typebea, I shelved the minoxidil after a few weeks to see if the serum, shampoo and conditioner would do anything. While that sparse patch is more or less unchanged, the length elsewhere is impressive. It’s important to note that while Typebea claims that its four-step system can reduce hair fall — how often your hair falls out on its own naturally — it doesn’t tackle hair loss.  Minoxidil also has a few potential side effects. “The most common can be scalp irritation, slight lowering of blood pressure and an increase in heart rate,” says Proudman. In some cases it can trigger more hair to shed as your hair enters the growing phase, continues Proudman, and this is likely to last for around four to six weeks. I stopped going to sleep with wet hair A dermatologist told me recently that hair is at its weakest point when wet, which encourages breakage. For that reason, I now always whip my hair up after washing into a microfibre towel like Kitsch Microfibre Hair Towel Wrap, $23, which I’m convinced is gentler on my strands, and I rough-dry my hair before bed rather than letting it dry naturally overnight. I like to use a speedy, lightweight hairdryer like Shark SpeedStyle Pro FLEX Professional Performance High-Velocity Hair Dryer System, £299.99. I also learned to brush my hair properly. “Get in the habit of brushing your hair from the ends,” Kingsley told me. She added that if you tend to start at the top or mid-lengths, you’re putting lots of tension on your strands — a fast track to breakage. When my hair is wet, I use a wide-tooth comb like Mane Knot Ur Avg Wide-Tooth Hair Comb, $20.50, and when it’s dry, I use the a paddle brush, which brushes comfortably and doesn’t ever tug.    I avoided pointless supplements Proudman recently told R29 that a poor diet and low levels of vitamins and minerals such as ferritin, vitamin B12, vitamin D and zinc may cause both hair shedding and slow growth. A blood test showed that I was deficient in vitamin D, and now I take a supplement. Besides vitamin D, it’s likely you’ve heard that biotin, or vitamin B7, can encourage better hair growth. But here’s the thing: You might not actually need it. Sally-Anne Tarver, a trichologist at the Cotswold Trichology Centre, previously told R29 that biotin supplements are only likely to work for people who have a deficiency. She said that such a deficiency is very rare in the Western world. “Simply stuffing [in] more biotin if you don’t need it will not result in healthier hair growth,” said Tarver. What it could do, though, is provide incorrect blood test results and even lead to hormonal issues.  This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. From the bob to the bixie, short haircuts have become the style of choice in salons up and down the country. Though they all look incredible, they’re also pretty high maintenance.  For those who aren’t too keen on booking in for a monthly trim, a mid-length cut might be your best bet. Far from mediocre, the in-between length isn’t only much easier to keep sharp – it’s also being touted as one of the biggest hair trends for 2025. “Mid-length cuts don’t have to feel like a long, grown out bob,” says Jordan Jones, stylist and color technician at Taylor Taylor London. “This year we’re being shown that they can be their own style with layers and careful shaping to create volume and movement, or shine and sophistication. If your bob has grown out and your hair has reached that awkward-length stage, or if you’ve got long locks and fancy a change without going super short, a trendy mid-length style is the cut for you.” On Instagram, London’s most sought-after stylists The Hair Bros are also championing medium-length cuts with curtain bangs, concave layers and natural waves. It seems we’ve all got the same idea: Google search for mid-length haircuts has risen by 180% recently and countless TikTokers are dedicating entire videos to mid-length haircut transformations. So which style will suit you best? Ahead, London’s best stylists reveal the biggest mid-length haircut trends that everyone can wear. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Mid-Length Drape View this post on Instagram A post shared by Francesca Inverarity (@frankie_inv) Curtain bangs are going nowhere fast but according to editorial hairstylist and presenter Neil Moodie, you might want to cancel your fringe trim, because it’s increasingly cool to let it grow out a little. “Grown-out curtain fringes are great and can make mid-length hair look more interesting,” he says. The more grown out the fringe, the easier it is to blend into the rest of your hair, particularly if you’re interested in getting a handful of layers to enhance volume and texture, like this style colored by The Hair Bros’ Francesca on Instagram. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Jagged Lob View this post on Instagram A post shared by BLEACH (@bleachlondon) “As the bob and long bobs have been around for a while, I feel like fringes are making a comeback,” says Neil. “The type of fringe I mean almost looks a bit homemade and very individual. It’s slightly jagged on the ends and a little uneven.” Take a cue from this pink style, dyed by Kat Gawel at BLEACH Brixton. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Mane View this post on Instagram A post shared by Francesca Inverarity (@frankie_inv) You’ve heard of the wolf cut (a variation on the shag, occupying a space between wild and relaxed) but ‘the mane’ is a lot more voluminous. “This is super edgy with lots of texture and a heavy fringe that needs to be worn long and in the eyes so it has plenty of movement,” explains Jordan Jones, stylist and color technician at Taylor Taylor London. “The face-framing layers of this cut make it perfect for adding texture and volume to the hair while defining the face.” So what should you ask for? “A choppy cut with plenty of layers that frame the face and create soft movement,” says Jordan. “Think Billie Eilish and Miley Cyrus’s shaggy ‘dos.” Jordan says the look works well with any hair texture. “Sea salt products are a must-have to give an effortless, freshly tousled finishing touch.” Take inspiration from this look by Francesca Inverarity. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Mid-Length Afro View this post on Instagram A post shared by Charlotte Mensah (@charlottemensah) “As we move into spring and summer I think we’ll be seeing a lot more natural afro and curly hair in medium lengths,” says celebrity hairdresser Lorraine Dublin, much like this beautiful, fluffed out afro and these bold blonde curls, both created by hair artist Charlotte Mensah. “In the colder months, hair thrives better in protective styles, so as the weather heats up we’ll be seeing afro hair in its natural state — with bold colors, too.” DashDividers_1_500x100 The Half Up, Half Down View this post on Instagram A post shared by dylan bradshaw DUBLIN (@dylanbradshawdublin) “Another trend that will continue to be popular is the half up, half down style,” says Lorraine, “especially with hair extensions.” She continues: “You can add an ombre hair color to the ends and combine this with a natural, soft, body wave.” Gemma Murphy from Dylan Bradshaw Dublin totally nails the cute in-between style here. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Collarbone Cut View this post on Instagram A post shared by BLUE TIT – HAIR SALONS (@bluetitlondon) “The collarbone cut is so popular right now,” says Tyler Moore, stylist at Live True London. He prefers a blunt edge and no layering but the look works equally well with a little bit of texture. “This style can be paired with a fringe for an ultra chic look and it works great on both straight and wavy or textured hair.” We love this look created by afro and textured hair educator Sharley Viola. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Flip View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Hair Bros (@thehairbros) “This is a versatile mid-length cut,” said The Hair Bros on Instagram. “When approaching a mid-length haircut there are a few points that we feel make all the difference. 1) Adding a substantial amount of shape around the face. 2) Cutting ‘accidental’, piecey layers throughout the hair.” The Hair Bros say a mid-length cut is its own style and that it’s important not to leave all of the hair one length. “This will end up looking heavy, as if it were a shorter bob. A middy hair cut should be full of texture and life and feel fun and playful. It’s great for anyone that wants to cut their long hair short but isn’t quite ready to brave a bob.” Flip your hair to one side for more of a natural, lived in feel. “As always, just a few products and some air should be enough to style this cut,” added The Hair Bros. Use a little styling cream like Hairstory Hair Balm, $37, and rough-dry with a hairdryer on low or medium heat. DashDividers_1_500x100 The ’90s Lob View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mijael Bickei (@studiobickei) The ’90s lob (aka long bob) is going to be everywhere soon, says Tyler. “This is a layered, mid-length long bob à la Rachel from Friends. Think of it as a more retro twist on the wolf cut with slightly longer layers and a sleeker texture.” Dreamed up by Mijael Bickei on Instagram, this lob is both glossy and textured. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Hi-Shine Lob View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝐒 𝐄 𝐕 𝐀 𝐍 𝐀 (@seva_glam_hair) “Embrace modern glamour with a super blunt cut with clean, sharp lines,” says Jordan, like this cut created by Sevana at Salon 26° North. “This style looks best when cut around the collarbone and is perfectly set off with mirror-shine hair.” This is all about the condition of your hair so make sure to use hydrating and nourishing conditioners or oils to create a super sleek style. Kérastase Elixir Ultime L’Original Hair Oil, $62, is a favorite among stylists. “If you are a brunette or darker, ask for a gloss color to add depth and shine,” adds Jordan. “Even opting for a Brazilian blow-dry or straightening treatment will help to put the finishing touches on this look.” DashDividers_1_500x100 Lived-In Lengths View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝑅𝓊𝒷𝓎 𝒯𝓊𝑒𝓈𝒹𝒶𝓎 𝐸𝓋𝑒𝓇𝓈 (@didntcatchthat) “Why is shoulder-length hair commonly perceived to be bad?” wrote The Hair Bros on Instagram. “It’s not!” This modern mid-length cut by hairstylist Liam Russell on Ruby Tuesday Evers has inspired the Bros’ work in-salon over the past few months. The bedhead texture and mussed up fringe give the medium length great shape. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Top-Heavy Cut View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝕰𝖒𝖎𝖑𝖞 𝕶𝖎𝖓𝖌𝖘𝖙𝖔𝖓 (@lemzkingston) The shag, the mullet, the shullet… Whatever you call the ‘00s most popular cut, it always seems to be evolving, as illustrated by Emily Kingston, stylist and colorist at Blue Tit Clapton. Proving the cut looks just as incredible on curly hair, the trick is to emphasize lots of volume around the top of the head and taper the lengths right down to the bottom so that hair sits just below the collarbone. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Side Fringe View this post on Instagram A post shared by James Samuel (@jamesjustnow) The side fringe perfectly accentuates a mid-length cut, says Jordan, like this style on model Julia Campbell-Gillies at Hershesons in London. “Curtain bangs have moved on and side bangs from the early ’00s are back. For fringe lovers who want a bit more excitement this year, this style flatters most face shapes and essentially frames the face with disconnected, slightly longer bangs. It’s not dramatic and easy to tuck behind your ear, pin to one side or sweep across the forehead with a big, bouncy blow-dry.” Jordan says it looks great on wavy, thicker hair in particular, styled as if it’s been casually flipped over. “To keep it on trend it’s best worn loose and tousled. Add spritzes of dry shampoo on the roots for second-day hair to amplify the volume and add a bit of texture.” This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?

    "description": "So you met the love of your life, and now you want to commemorate the relationship with a symbol as everlasting as your love for one another. No, we're not talking about an engagement ring. We're talking about a couple's tattoo. Similar to what is often referred to as a \"tramp stamp,\" up until recently, the couple's tattoo has been stigmatized as cringe at best, and risky at worst. A lot of the hesitation stems from its permanence and public examples of tattoo regret (think: Johnny Depp's infamous Winona cover-up). Ironically, the idea of getting married can feel more reversible. Still, with over 750 million views around the term on TikTok, it seems more people are getting tattoos with their significant others - just look at Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck and Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra. So, why is the couple's tattoo gaining popularity again? The rise of social media and its expectation to share personal milestones could be a significant driving factor. \"Couples may feel a need or desire to publicly showcase their commitment and love story, leading to a rise in tattoos as a visible, permanent symbol,\" psychologist Raffaello Antonino, PsyD, says. \"Alongside the general societal destigmatization of tattoos, this could be contributing to their growing popularity among couples.\" On the flip side, a couple's tattoo can be a way to break away from social norms and traditions. \"This trend mirrors an increasing desire for non-traditional expressions of commitment,\" says divorce attorney Laura Wasser. \"The driving factor is the search for more personalized and unique ways to symbolize relationships, beyond conventional methods like wedding rings.\" PS spoke with experts to better understand what type of couples are more likely to get one and what it signifies about your relationship. Experts Featured in This Article Laura Wasser is a family expert and divorce attorney for the stars, including celebrities like Kim Kardashian. Raffaello Antonino, PsyD, is a counseling psychologist. Dan Zie is the CEO of Sunmood Divorce Consultancy. Kalley Hartman is a licensed marriage and family therapist in Newport Beach, CA. Why Do Some Couples Get Matching Tattoos? There are many reasons to want a couple's tattoo with your partner, from symbolizing commitment to sharing a meaningful experience. It was harmless fun for Casey Ryan and her husband during their honeymoon in Italy last year. They each chose a different pasta shape for the inside of their elbow, on opposite arms, so when they hold hands, the ink aligns. \"It was spontaneous, cheesy, fun, a bit thrilling like a leap of faith because it is so early on in our marriage,\" she says. \"Even if we don't end up staying together over the entire course of our lives, I think it will be a beautiful time in our relationship to look back on and remember.\" In an informal poll on social media, most people who wrote in with couple tattoos said they only did it when they were already married - almost an extension of their commitment to each other. Ryan admits that she was firmly in the anti-couple-tattoo camp before marriage. Paulina Jayne Isaac tattooed a line from her husband's vows. \"I love tattoos,\" she says when asked what drew her to the idea. \"They represent a certain feeling for me and mark a time in my life.\" The vow was her sixth tattoo. \"It's a wonderful reminder every time I see it and is a symbol of our commitment to each other. I like how my tattoos tell a story.\" For others, it's less about the commitment of marriage and more about the tattoo itself. Quinn is polyamorous and wants to get a couple's tattoos with two of their partners. For them, it's less about symbolizing commitment and more about sharing a fun, niche reference to their relationships. \"It's just cute, and I know we'll be in each other's lives, so it feels safe to get it.\" The motivations behind a couple choosing to get a matching tattoo can reveal their relationship dynamics. \"On a healthy spectrum, couples who share a passion for tattoos might see it as an exciting shared experience, a bonding activity that further strengthens their connection and commitment,\" Dr. Antonino says. \"This can symbolize an equal partnership where both individuals share the same values and interests.\" With their relationship's on-again, off-again nature, Lopez and Affleck are a great example of a couple who would desire a symbol of permanency. Point made: The singer captioned the Instagram reveal of their couple's tattoo with \"#CommitmentIsSexy.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo) However, in some cases, the decision can be rooted in insecure attachment styles, Dr. Antonino says. If a couple is on rocky ground, it might be tempting to make a big gesture in the hope it will save the relationship, similar to a home renovation or vow renewal. \"One partner might urge the other into getting a matching tattoo as a means of controlling or asserting possession, a reflection of their fear of abandonment or betrayal,\" he says. \"While it may seem romantic on the surface, it's important to identify and address these potentially harmful dynamics.\" The History of the Couple's Tattoo Some divorce attorneys may feel too cynical to support a couple's tattoo, but Dan Zie, CEO of Sunmood Divorce Consultancy, offers a different perspective. \"Tattoos have been a part of Chinese culture for centuries, and couples getting tattoos were sometimes used to show love, commitment, and loyalty between two people,\" he says. The earliest example is the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE). \"During this time period, it was common for couples to get matching yin-yang symbols on their skin,\" Zie says. The symbol represents the balance between male and female energies in relationships then. \"And later in the Tang Dynasty (618 - 907 CE), couples commonly got matching Buddhist symbols such as lotus flowers or wheels of Dh to represent their connection with each other spiritually and physically.\" Tattoo customs have changed a lot since then. In recent decades, tattoos have gone from taboo counterculture to becoming more normalized. Some couples are just the type to get matching tattoos, and it doesn't require as much significance as people once thought. Now there are many variations of the \"couple's tattoo,\" from matching ink to pieces inspired by each other. For example, Alli Tooms-Joner got a Nightmare Before Christmas tattoo inspired by her husband. \"In 2020, we got married on Halloween, and we pretty much celebrate it year-round,\" she says. \"For our first anniversary, when I started my sleeve, I knew I wanted an NBC tattoo, so when I got this one, it was with him in mind.\" A couple's tattoo doesn't even have to symbolize everlasting love. In her memoir \"Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail,\" Cheryl Strayed wrote that she got a matching tattoo with her husband right before finalizing their divorce to represent the mark they left on each other. Each tattoo is unique to the couple. Is Getting a Couple's Tattoo Ever a Good Idea? The short answer: each couple knows what's best for their relationship. But Dr. Antonino suggests taking a beat to understand your motives. \"If you're seeking a tattoo to quell insecurities or fears of abandonment, it might be more beneficial to address those issues directly with your partner or a therapist.\" Because, of course, getting a tattoo together has potential consequences. \"Relationships may not always last forever, and a tattoo is a permanent reminder of a past relationship,\" says licensed marriage and family therapist Kalley Hartman. \"This can be especially difficult if the couple breaks up or feelings change over time.\" So before getting a couple's tattoo, individuals should consider the permanence of the decision because removal can be painful and expensive. Would you still be happy with the tattoo if the relationship doesn't work out? Kelsa Blaine got an anchor tattoo on her ring finger as a symbol of how her husband grounded her. A little over a year later, they divorced. \"I feel like it's still a good reminder to myself to stay grounded.\" She plans to turn the tattoo into a mountain or a tree if she ever gets remarried. Ultimately, it's essential to think the decision through first. \"Tattoos are more permanent than even marriage,\" Tooms-Joner says. \"My husband is still my best friend and the best thing that has ever happened to me. But life happens, and you never know what the future will be. Even if something does happen, this tattoo will be a representation of my life and the love I have now.\" Melanie Whyte was a contributing staff writer for PS.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/air-dry-vs-blow-drying-hair-health-49423631",
    "description": "Raise your hand if your hairstylist has ever told you that heat styling is a one-way ticket to unnecessary damage. This means, along with avoiding straighteners and curling irons, you should air-dry your hair to keep it as healthy as possible, right? Well, that might not be the case. In a now-viral TikTok, cosmetic chemist Javon Ford purports that new studies illustrate that using diffused heat to dry hair is actually less damaging than air-drying. If this information goes against everything stylists have told you for, well, ever, you're not alone. Does air-drying actually damage hair? Is it time to pick up your hair dryer and perfect your at-home blowout skills? Don't worry - we have all the answers. PS spoke with two professional hairstylists to get to the bottom of this and figure out once and for all if air-drying your hair isn't as beneficial as we once thought. Experts Featured in This Article Marc Ballance is a celebrity hairstylist at IGK salon in New York City. Mia Santiago is a celebrity hairstylist and founder of Headspace by Mia in Columbus, Ohio. Does Air-Drying Hair Cause Damage? According to celebrity hairstylist Marc Ballance, wet hair is more fragile than dry. Essentially, water destabilizes the protein bonds that hold hair together, which makes it more susceptible to stretching and breakage. Have you ever noticed how brushing wet hair or tying it up results in extra shedding, more so than when it's dry? I's not a coincidence. Celebrity hairstylist Mia Santiago adds that the longer hair stays wet, the more prone it is to damage. AKA those with thicker, coarser hair that naturally holds extra water are even more at risk of breakage. The issues don't stop at your ends, either. \"Wet hair can lead to excessive moisture on the scalp, which can lead to irritation or dandruff,\" Ballance says. However, if air-drying works for you, you don't have to completely change your routine. The key is creating a method that works for your hair and needs. More on that below, but first. . . Is Blow-Drying Hair Healthy? There is a way to blow-dry your hair that reduces damage and keeps it healthy - and it all lies in the technique. The number one rule? Use a low to medium heat setting and keep the airflow moving. \"Don't focus on one section of hair for too long,\" says Santiago. \"This will lessen heat damage.\" The study pinpoints the exact distance at which you should hold the dryer: at least 15 centimeters away. Ballance also recommends angling the dryer down as you work. This seals the cuticle and smooths your hair in the process to reduce frizz and produce a silky effect. Using a diffuser also lessens damage because it disperses the hot air across a larger area, which helps hair dry faster and more evenly. While diffusers are often marketed toward those with curly hair, anyone can benefit from drying their hair with one - especially if you have fine hair for an extra volume boost. Regardless of your approach to drying your hair, experts emphasize the importance of using a heat protectant, like the Bumble and Bumble Hairdresser's Invisible Oil Heat/UV Protective Primer ($34), to prevent any damage from heat styling. What's the Best Way to Air-Dry Hair? Let us be clear: you can still have healthy hair if you air-dry your hair. Utilizing the correct products will help strengthen ends and give you the best results. Ballance first recommends swapping your regular towel for a microfiber towel, like the Kitsch Microfiber Hair Towel ($23). Standard bath towels can be too rough on hair. \"Using a microfiber towel will keep the hair cuticle flat and reduce the amount of knots you have,\" he says. Once hair isn't sopping wet, gently detangle with a brush and then apply an air styling product designed to enhance your natural texture, boost shine, and reduce frizz. Santiago suggests the Ouai Air Dry Foam ($28) or the Living Proof StyleLab Air-Dry Styling Cream ($34). Ultimately, whether you air-dry or blow-dry your hair is a personal preference, and one isn't necessarily better than the other as long as you use the right method. \"There's a great benefit to both; try them each out to see what works best for you,\" says Santiago.
