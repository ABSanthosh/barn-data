    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. Following the last six months of industry musical chairs, another wave took place in March when it was announced that three major fashion houses were undergoing changes: Demna leaving Balenciaga to become Gucci’s new artistic director, Donatella Versace stepping down as creative director of her namesake legacy brand and Jonathan Anderson leaving Loewe after 11 years at its helm. But career changes weren’t the only headline-worthy fashion moments in March, with Paris Fashion Week providing plenty of moments that stopped the internet. Chappell Roan stepped straight from the 2025 Grammy Awards into the Rick Owens show wearing an alien-inspired, dotted face paint look complete with white contacts. Doechii made her fashion week debut with a gravity-defying blowdry at Schiaparelli, not to mention a frosted green eyeshadow look and black-lined lips for the Acne FROW. Plus, Gigi Hadid made a case for the “silver tequila” bob at the Le Grand Dîner du Louvre. For those on the hunt for even more fashion and beauty inspiration, you’ll be glad to know that April has a slew of exciting releases, launches, and products heading your way. Read ahead to take a look at all the best fashion and beauty bits coming this month.All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.Reformation x Devon Lee CarlsonFollowing drops with Laura Harrier and Camille Rowe, Reformation is back with another It Girl collaboration. This time, the brand tapped Devon Lee Carlson to design the new collection. The standout looks of the 20-piece collection include a chocolate polka dot mini dress, a '90s-inspired sky blue co-ord complete with a matching neck scarf, and a backless black lace knit dress — all made using materials like organic cotton and deadstock fabrics.Shop now at ReformationReformation x Devon Lee Carlson Cher Dress, $, available at ReformationOld Navy Launches Special-Occasion Dresses This spring and summer, Old Navy wants you to get dressed up — literally. The retailer just launched The Occasion, a new collection of elevated — and affordable — dresses and separates for special events. With prices ranging from $44.99 to $64.99, the capsule features elegant twist-front maxi dresses, sleek cowl-neck satin gowns, joyful bubble-hem mini dresses, all of which are available in sizes XS to 4X (or 0 to 30). “I’ve designed dresses for women in every scenario — from everyday moments to the red carpet — so it was a pleasure to lend my expertise to Sarah [Holme, Old Navy head of design and product development] and collaborate with the Old Navy design team on The Occasion,” chief creative officer Zac Posen said in a press release. “This collection is elevated, accessible, and truly makes any event feel special.” Shop now at Old Navy Old Navy Satin Cowl Maxi Dress, $, available at Old NavyCoach Becomes Official Partner of the WNBA Professional women’s basketball just got even more stylish because Coach is now an official partner of the WNBA. The deal — which, according to a press release, is meant to encourage players and fans to embrace and express all aspects of their personalities — will pop up in different ways throughout the 2025 season. That includes the WNBA Draft, which was held in New York City on April 14 and saw top prospects like Paige Bueckers (the first overall pick), Hailey Van Lith, and Aneesah Morrow sporting Coach at the event. Another aspect of the partnership? Coach will become the presenting sponsor of WNBA Pride, a platform celebrating the LGBTQ+ community. Photo: GettyJones Road Just Enough Tinted MoisturizerSummer is coming, and that means switching up our coverage in favor of something more warm-weather-appropriate. Jones Road (created by makeup artist Bobbi Brown) is on the case with the launch of the new Just Enough Tinted Moisturizer. Designed to conceal redness and even out the skin tone with light coverage, this product is ideal for those who don’t like to wear a lot of makeup. The silky formula minimizes the appearance of redness and hyperpigmentation without a mask-like finish and provides just enough tint for minimal makeup days. Shop now at Jones Road BeautyJones Road Just Enough Tinted Moisturizer, $, available at Jones RoadCult Gaia Introduces Bridal Collection The brand behind the viral Ark bag and Cassidy Sandal — and the latest Gap collaborator — Cult Gaia is walking down the aisle. The LA brand has just launched its debut bridal collection, and it’s full of sculptural, statement-making styles that break the typical wedding-day mold — think a mini dress made from silk-chiffon braided material, a floral-lace gown with removable sleeves, a plisséd 3-D top, and more. “Crafted for the effortless bride, each piece is thoughtfully created to captivate, inspire, and evoke pure emotion on your most special days,” Cult Gaia founder Jasmin Larian Hekmat said in a press release. Prices range from $428 to $3,498. Shop now at Cult GaiaCult Gaia Henley Dress, $, available at Cult Gaia\u0026 Other Stories’ Heart-filled Savoir CollectionWhen it comes to \u0026 Other Stories’ spring 2025 Savoir Collection, it’s all about love. The latest edition of the brand’s more luxurious, atelier-focused line is made up of cherry reds, blossom pinks, and pieces covered in whimsical heart, lip, and bow motifs. Find a cropped white button-front shirt with beaded detailing on the collar, wide-leg pleated trousers with delicate ties on the leg, a warm-weather-ready maxi dress with sequinned embellishments, and so much more. Shop on April 10 at \u0026 Other Stories The Ordinary Multi-Antioxidant Radiance SerumAntioxidants (think vitamin C) can offer a neutralizing and protective effect against free radicals like UV and pollution, keeping skin bright, bouncy, and smooth. But while one antioxidant is a great start, The Ordinary is now bringing eight key antioxidant ingredients together in its new Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum. Here’s why it’s beneficial: Our skin is consistently exposed to the aforementioned environmental aggressors, and these free radicals build up and lead to fine lines, dullness, and uneven skin tone. This serum works hard to prevent that from happening — and our beauty director is already a big fan.Shop now at The Ordinary and SephoraThe Ordinary Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum, $, available at SephoraBarbour x CrocsBarbour might be best known for being a favorite of the British Royal Family, but this spring, the heritage label is stepping into a more casual territory, announcing a collaboration with functional footwear brand Crocs. The limited-edition collection contains a wax jacket, two footwear styles in a tartan graphic print, and nine Jibbitz charms, bringing together the playfulness of Crocs and the practicality of Barbour. Festival season, here we come.Shop now at BarbourBarbour x Crocs Oversized Bedale Waxed Jacket, $, available at Barbour​​Dyson Supersonic r™ hair dryer in Ceramic PinkThe beauty world stood still in 2016 when Dyson brought out its first ergonomic hair dryer. Since then, the tech giant has dominated the hair space with the Coralle straightener and the highly coveted Airwrap multi-styler. Recently, the company announced that its professional Supersonic r™ hair dryer will soon be available to the public, having previously only been exclusive to salons and hairstylists. To mark the occasion, you can buy the curve-nozzled dryer in a pearly pink colorway (with a purple gemstone shade available in the summer). The Supersonic r™ is Dyson’s lightest and most powerful hairdryer, offering easier maneuverability in comparison to the original model, as well as specific attachments for straight, wavy, curly and coily hair types.Shop now at Dyson Dyson Supersonic r™ hair dryer, $, available at DysonNomasei Debuts First Stiletto HeelsParis-based footwear brand Nomasei is the label behind the fashion crowd’s favorite stylish (and comfy!) loafer, but it’s not stopping there. For the first time ever, the brand debuted stiletto heels: the Gattaca ($595), a streamlined slingback pump available in embossed white and black patent leathers, and the Before Sunrise ($651), an open-toed sandal with ankle straps also available in embossed black and white leather. According to the press release, Nomasei co-founder Paule Tenaillon was inspired by her years designing classic tango heels in Buenos Aires, where comfort and wearability were all-important. As a result, both styles (which were named for the cult ’90s films) also emphasize arch support and memory foam. Shop now at Nomasei Nomasei Gattaca Pumps, $, available at NomaseiSol de Janeiro Limited-Edition Perfume Mist CollectionIf you ask us, a new season calls for a new scent. Luckily, Sol de Janeiro is launching three fragrances this month, each with its own distinct Powerpuff Girl-esque personality. Flor Mística is spring in a bottle, thanks to notes of orange blossom, flamingo flower, and Brazilian gardenia. Água Mística is for fans of something fresh, with notes of neroli water, salty skin, and tangerine, while Dança Mística is made for the dance floor, with hints of purple fig, warm vanilla, sandalwood, and lily of the valley. Plus, the set comes with a Scent Menu —  tips on how to layer the fragrances to create your own unique combination. Shop now at Sol de JaneiroSol de Janeiro Limited Edition Perfume Mist Trio, $, available at Sol de JaneiroSANDRO x Louise BourgeoisFor the artistic among us, the announcement of Sandro’s latest collection will be joyous news to the ears. Taking inspiration from French-American artist Louise Bourgeois, the spring collection features geometric patterns. In particular, spirals feature heavily in the collection, inspired in part by the artist’s famous “Spider” sculpture. Boasting Mediterranean blues and oat milk neutrals, the collection features linen dresses, silky trousers, and cotton poplin pants — a perfect spring wardrobe.Shop on April 9 at SandroColorwow Texas Hold’em Big Hold Hairspray Colorwow's Texas Hold'em Hairspray is a perfect paradox — it delivers a strong hold yet feels like the lightest hairspray you've ever tried. It kept our beauty director’s waves intact throughout an entire day, an eight-hour night flight, and a lengthy layover in an airport, making it feel almost a shame to wash out. Even better? It offers additional heat and UV protection, shields against frizz-inducing humidity, and brushes out with ease, leaving hair feeling soft and silky, not crispy or chalky. Shop now at SephoraColorWow Texas Hold 'Em Big Hold Hairspray, $, available at SephoraMagda Butrym x H\u0026MEach H\u0026M designer collaboration is an anticipated event. Whether you’ve previously recurred a pair of Simone Rocha beaded drop earrings or a corseted Mugler dress, the collaborations offer a chance to enter the world of luxury at a much sweeter price point. For the latest collection, the Swedish giant has turned to Polish designer Magda Butrym, who has dubbed the 19-piece collection a “celebration of femininity in bloom.” From denim bustiers with 3D rose adornments to shimmering gowns with glittering floral embellishments, this collection is made for spring soirees.Shop on April 24 at H\u0026MLike what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/green-nails-manicure-trend-ideas?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "While the first few months of 2025 saw neutral nails take over our social feeds (think soap nails and barely-there tints), we’re slowly but surely noticing more vibrant manicures emerging. Right now, there’s only one color that’s dominating salons: green. It might sound unexpected, but green nails are surprisingly versatile, uniting both manicurists and nail lovers alike, thanks to the many ways to wear them. From serene shades of matcha to zestier splashes of lime, consider ditching the muted manicure and embracing something a lot fresher for spring.  To prove that green really is the most lively color of the season, we caught up with some of the industry’s biggest nail experts to get their take on the best ways to wear it right now. Plus, we’ve rounded up some of the coolest green manicures on our feeds to inspire your own set of nails. Soft Pistachio View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mateja Novakovic (@matejanova) “Pastels are back for spring and my favorite green shade this year is a dreamy pistachio,” says manicurist Julia Diogo, one of Bio Sculpture’s top techs. Nail content creator Mateja Novakovic’s chic green nails illustrate the color perfectly. Diogo recommends Bio Sculpture’s Cloudcha Polish, £14.50, to get a similar “fresh and versatile tone” at home. Freshly-Cut Grass View this post on Instagram A post shared by Phoebe Cascarina (@phoebesummernails) At the other end of the spectrum, this bright and bold shade of green is one of my favorites for spring and summer. Nail content creator Phoebe Cascarina amps up the fun with scalloped edges and kitsch cherry detailing for a vibrant manicure. Elevated Olive View this post on Instagram A post shared by Julia Diogo (@paintedbyjools) If you’re wedded to neutral nails, then dare I suggest that this spring’s take on olive green might be perfect for you? Look for a color with yellow undertones — similar to the one sported by manicurist Julia Diogo — to keep it feeling chic and sophisticated. Try Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Polish in Cactus Makes Perfect, $8.32. Mint Choc Tips View this post on Instagram A post shared by ✧.* patrycja • nyc (@finewinenails) Hayley McColm, Mii Cosmetics nail expert, recommends trying out the green nail trend with a French tip like this design by nail creator Patrycja, aka @finewinenails. “Bright limes and sage greens have been my go-to, and adding a floral design is great for spring and summer,” says McColm. Try Essie Nail Lacquer in Mint Candy Apple, $10, for the perfect creamy green shade. Sage Shimmer View this post on Instagram A post shared by Melly K (@melly.k.nails) Combining two of this year’s coolest nail trends — soft sage green and pixie dust shimmer — this ethereal green manicure by Melly K is great if you like your nails to have a little extra dimension. Neon French View this post on Instagram A post shared by Blayke Jacques (@blaykejacques) Expect to see more electrifying shades of green grow in popularity as we move towards summer, just like these luminescent micro tips by nail stylist Blayke Jacques. “A neon green French manicure injects a playful pop of color, making it an undeniable favorite for a fun finish,” says Diogo. Try China Glaze Strengthening Nail Polish In The Lime Light, $8.95. Matcha Latte View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lois Samantha – Natural Nail Specialist (@polishedbylolo) Not content with being the cool girl drink of the season, matcha is coming for our manicures, too, as luxury manicurist Lois Samantha (aka @polishedbylolo) demonstrates here. “Kure Bazaar’s Matcha Latte, $22, is the perfect soft green shade for spring and summer, and looks great on the tips for an alternative French manicure look, too,” says nail technician Metta Francis. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Zu Nailbar (@zu_nailbar) Elevate the shade with a magnetic cat-eye polish, like this look created by Hongoroo at Zu Nailbar. Emerald Marble View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nail Art Salon \u0026 Training Academy The Cotswolds (@_h.collective) Marble nails are slowly emerging as one of the biggest nail texture trends of the year, and this gorgeous green set by @_h.collective proves that it works just as well in this season’s most popular hue.  Aqua Splash View this post on Instagram A post shared by Melanated Mani aka Anna (@melanated.mani) “Aqua green will also bring a pop of color to nails this spring,” says session manicurist Ami Streets. “Inspired by the ocean, it’s the perfect holiday look.” Streets suggests opting for a color with “a beautiful opalescent or shimmering finish,” just like Anna’s (aka @melanated.mani) sparkling set.

    "description": "Red, itchy, and scaly skin from atopic dermatitis and eczema can be uncomfortable, confusing, and all too familiar. These chronic (meaning they can last a long time) inflammatory conditions can appear in childhood or remain dormant until adulthood, with a wide scale of severity along the way. \"Once you have atopic dermatitis, you will have it for life, though symptoms may not always be prevalent,\" dermatologist Corey L. Hartman, MD, tells PS. While it may sound bleak, these long-term skin conditions are common and totally manageable - both at home and in a derm's office. So, what's the difference between atopic dermatitis and eczema? We've tapped the experts to break down everything you need to know about these skin conditions. Keep reading to learn more about the symptoms and how to treat them. Experts Featured in This Article Corey L. Hartman, MD, FAAD, is a board-certified dermatologist and the founder of Skin Wellness Dermatology in Birmingham, AL. Naana Boakye, MD, MPH, FAAD, is a board-certified dermatologist and the founder of Bergen Dermatology in Englewood Cliffs, NJ. What Is Eczema? The terms atopic dermatitis and eczema are used somewhat interchangeably because they're ultimately part of the same family. \"Eczema is a general term for inflammatory skin conditions. And atopic dermatitis is a specific form of and the most common type of eczema,\" dermatologist Naana Boakye, MD, says. It's a widespread condition, affecting one in 10 people, according to the National Eczema Association, that spans all ages, ethnicities, and skin colors. It's important to note that eczema can also be an umbrella term that refers to conditions like dermatitis, discoid eczema, and dyshidrotic eczema. What Is Atopic Dermatitis? Atopic dermatitis as a type of eczema that appears as itchy patches of dry skin. These patchy lesions typically pop up on the arms and the backs of the legs, with colors ranging between red and brown depending on your skin color. The skin may crack, flake, or thicken (also known as lichenification). The condition is most commonly seen among children, though adults can certainly be affected as well. And it's often hereditary. \"If one parent has atopic dermatitis, there is a 50 percent chance that their child will have it,\" Dr. Boakye says. Atopic dermatitis has another little family of its own, alongside allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma; they're known as the atopic triad. What Causes Atopic Dermatitis and Eczema? Despite being widespread, the exact cause of atopic dermatitis is unknown - though there is increasing belief that it may begin as an autoimmune condition, according to a study published in the British Journal of Dermatology. Per Dr. Boakye, the causes of atopic dermatitis or eczema can \"be complex and involve genetics and environmental factors that lead to skin and immune system disruption.\" For example, a family history of asthma or allergies (like hay fever) can increase the prevalence of atopic dermatitis. Eczema flare-ups can also be triggered by external factors (cold weather, mold, and pollen) or irritants like cigarette smoke and certain fragrances. And last but not least, overdoing it on skin care can also be problematic. \"Damaged skin barriers can also contribute to irritation-prone skin,\" Dr. Boakye says. What Are the Symptoms of Atopic Dermatitis and Eczema? Irritation is the most common symptom. It commonly manifests as red, itchy, or dry skin - with swelling common in more moderate cases. \"In severe cases, the skin may develop a rash that may bleed when scratched or may ooze or secrete a clear fluid,\" Dr. Hartman says. If you are experiencing persistent irritation, a trip to the dermatologist can help provide clarity and a course of treatment. How Can You Treat Atopic Dermatitis and Eczema? Before you can accurately treat atopic dermatitis, dermatologists believe it's important to understand and avoid your triggers. \"Avoid foods that can cause an inflammatory response in the body, like citrus and certain spices like cinnamon and cloves,\" Dr. Hartman says, adding that \"alcohol can also trigger atopic dermatitis symptoms.\" This could mean shifting your lifestyle to reduce stress, increase exercise, and eat a more wholesome diet, or adjusting your routine to moisturize immediately after showers/baths and transition to gentle, fragrance-free products. Dr. Hartman recommends adding inflammation-fighting steps to your skin-care regimen. \"There is evidence to suggest that red-light phototherapy can help treat signs of atopic dermatitis,\" he says. For moderate to severe cases, Dr. Boakye notes that treatments could include topical steroids, nonsteroidals, biologics, or phototherapy. When in doubt, your derm will know what's best for you.
