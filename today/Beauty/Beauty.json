If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. There are so many lovely things about fall, from the leaves changing colors to the weather finally cooling down enough to snuggle up in cozy cardigans — but one thing that’s not so great is the dry skin that often accompanies the change in weather.  While it’s nice not to sweat off all our skincare the moment we step outside from the blazing summer sun, the layering of thick moisturizers to combat dry patches of skin isn’t ideal either. I mean who likes the feeling of a heavy cream physically clogging each pore one by one? Not me, for sure. The solution: a hydrating skincare routine that both moisturizes and protects without being too heavy on our skin. Lucky for you, Credo Beauty, one of our favorite clean beauty retailers, has just launched its first-ever skincare line sold exclusively at the retailer, a collection of two cleansers (priced at $44 each) and four moisturizers (priced at $64 each) with a secret hydration ingredient: vetiver root that has been years in the making. Like many of you, I had heard of the usual hydrating ingredients such as niacinamide and hyaluronic acid, but not vetiver root. According to Credo Beauty, “Vetiver root is an antioxidant-loaded, potent wonder grass that supports the protection of the skin’s barrier for a vibrant skin tone and a nourished complexion while improving skin texture and reducing the appearance of pores and wrinkles.” Each product in the line is designed to target different skin needs including dry skin, sensitive skin, redness, aging, and dullness. Credo Beauty has been making waves in the beauty industry since its first store opened in 2015 — today it stands as the largest clean and sustainable beauty retailer in North America selling over 120 brands such as Tower28, OSEA, and Kosas, that all meet the rigorous “Credo Clean Standard” guidelines, ensuring that the products sold are the best of the best for consumers and the planet in terms of the ingredients used, the processes to make products and packaging, and much more. I am personally very impressed with the company’s commitment to clean beauty and encourage everyone to do a deeper dive on the website about how Credo Beauty is advocating for better beauty. The release of their first-ever in-house brand is a testament to that commitment. This benefits-driven skincare line has been 10 years in the making after years of customer feedback, experience, and data collection and is an impressive show of brand transparency and a drive for more sustainable practices in the beauty industry. Each pump and cap in the skincare line is made of NewMatter material, a first-of-its-kind mixture of hard-to-recycle beauty waste packaging that was collected through Pact Collective in beauty stores nationwide — this is a landmark for implementing sustainable processes in beauty packaging. Fun fact: every 38 pumps eliminated one pound of material ending up in landfills or the ocean. So basically, both the product and the packaging are thoughtfully designed to be better and set a standard for how brands can create a great product while still prioritizing sustainability.  Ahead, Refinery29 spoke with Credo Beauty Co-Founder and CEO Annie Jackson to understand more about why Credo Beauty made the jump into its first in-house skincare line, clean beauty and fall skincare.  The following interview was told to Becca Sax and edited for length and clarity. Credo Beauty is home to a lot of great skincare. What was the inspiration behind creating an in-house range?We had 10 years of data, 15 brick-and-mortar stores and a very close relationship with our customers, and with all of that information, we felt compelled to create a skincare brand addressing our customer’s concerns. Hydration or lack of hydration was the top skincare concern across the board so we launched two cleansers and four moisturizers addressing different aspects of that. What are your favorite products from Credo Beauty’s new skincare line?This is so difficult, but probably Rewinder, an anti-aging moisturizer with three forms of Vitamin C! I’m getting a little bit more mature, and Rewinder is great for freshening the complexion and addressing dullness. Deep Thirst is also a necessity — it’s like a hug for my skin, providing immediate hydration. I probably go through one bottle a month! How do you define clean beauty and skincare in 2024?For me, clean beauty is about conscientiously formulating products. Currently, innovation is meeting the demands of consumers who are seeking more transparency about the ingredients in their products. Embodying clean beauty is really about the safety — from the sources to the sustainability aspect of every ingredient that is used — not just talking about if it’s efficacious, which is definitely important in skincare, but each ingredient has to have a reason to be in there. For Credo Beauty, the ingredients used in the products we sell have to be ones that we feel we can stand behind in terms of claims and safety.  The “clean beauty” trend started in late 2021 and has been huge in today’s culture with everyone from celebrities to consumers taking part, as the founder and CEO of a clean beauty pioneering retailer, how do you implement it in your life?This company really loves the “clean beauty” trend, the “no-makeup makeup” trend and using products that just bring out your natural beauty is what Credo is all about. We have really talented makeup artists on our team who love to create these “clean girl” beauty looks that are really just using skincare-infused makeup products that people love to bring out people’s natural beauty — we’re all for it! What makeup or skincare products are most likely to include harmful ingredients?The one classification of ingredients that is seen across conventional beauty products is Polyethylene glycols (PEGs, read more under the “Glycols” section on the Credo Beauty website). PEGs are a class of synthetic ingredients that that go through a certain manufacturing process that produces a carcinogenic byproduct called 1,4-dioxane. I think it tends to be a controversial ingredient classification because many brands that manufacture and are using PEGs strip out the 1,4-dioxane when the finished product is done. But as a carcinogen, the problem is that it was created in the first place. So, when it’s stripped out of the product, it’s then discarded somewhere and usually ends up in waterways, being transported in vehicles, in fenceline communities — it’s something that doesn’t need to be in beauty products. I think Credo Beauty has proven that you can make efficacious skincare and makeup products without them, so I’d love to see people consciously selecting ingredients with these kinds of things in mind. What products do you recommend that people use for fall?Deep Thirst, for sure. We expect it to be our hero product from the line because it offers intense hydration with vetiver root and hyaluronic acid. Vetiver extract comes from the vetiver root, an ingredient typically used in fragrance. It’s not something you normally see in skincare, so we are pretty proud to be using this ingredient that’s typically discarded (but has really strong clinicals supporting microbiome protection and hydration) in our skincare line.  What are some of your favorite clean beauty and skincare products as we head into the second half of the year? What should be on people’s radar?This is such a hard question, I think the LolaVie Glossing Detangler for my hair and Josh Rosebrook Hydrating Accelerator Mist are on my list, for sure. Josh Rosebrook makes a mini Hydrating Accelerator, and it’s my ride-or-die — he knows that I take it everywhere I go. I always give myself a little spritz of the mist after cleansing or putting on makeup! The Iris \u0026 Romeo Weekend Skin is also one of my go-tos; it’s got SPF 50 and a slight tint, so it gives your skin a little luminosity. What beauty myth do you love debunking?This is such a boring answer, but the best anti-aging beauty product in the whole world that you can use is sunscreen. It’s the one thing that I won’t even stand on a soapbox telling you to use clean sunscreen — because the best sunscreen in the world that you can use is the one that you will wear. As evidenced by my lovely melanoma scar here. If you have to buy one beauty product, buy sunscreen. Like what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. One of the biggest misconceptions about beauty products is that they have to cost a small fortune to be effective. Brands like The Ordinary and The Inkey List have proven that to be incorrect where skincare is concerned, and we’d argue that the same goes for makeup. (Find us a beauty enthusiast who doesn’t have high praise for the affordable e.l.f.) Haircare seems to be a different story, though. If your FYP is anything like ours, you might’ve come across so-called hair experts warning against the supposed effects of cheap hair products like shampoo, for example, citing hard-to-remove buildup and even hair loss as potential ramifications. More often than not, these videos come with recommendations for expensive alternatives.  Luxury products certainly have their place in haircare but the professionals are working overtime to dispel the aforementioned myths. Take certified trichologist Abbey Yung, whose TikTok account is something of a re-education in affordable haircare. The common consensus? Regardless of your hair length or texture, it doesn’t matter how much you spend on a hair product provided it’s formulated well, works for you and is within your budget.  @abbeyyung Should I do this for another drugstore brand next? Products Mentioned: @pantene Volume \u0026 Body Shampoo Miracle Rescue 10-in-1 Leave In Conditioner Spray Miracle Rescue Deep Repair Conditioner Miracle Rescue Intensive Bond Repair Mask #haircareproducts #hairproducts #healthyhair ♬ original sound – Abbey Yung So we asked hair experts and beauty editors to share the hair products that you can get away with spending less on, from scalp serums to anti-dandruff treatments. Hairbrushes “There’s a luxury market for excessively expensive hairbrushes and combs but in reality, a well-made, affordable option can do the job just as effectively,” says Dr. Bessam Farjo, hair transplant surgeon at Farjo Hair Institute. “A wide-tooth comb or a brush with flexible bristles is all you need to detangle hair gently without causing breakage,” Dr. Farjo adds. The key, he says, is to use the right technique, especially if you have longer hair: “Start from the ends and work your way upwards — and I’m not talking about the price tag.” This will reduce pulling and snagging, which can lead to breakage and split ends. Essentially, whether you’re dealing with fragile hair or just daily maintenance, Dr. Farjo says that a cheaper brush or comb can still keep your hair healthy and tangle-free.  For hair that tangles easily, R29 rates Wet Brush Original Detangler, $9.99. If you’re looking for an everyday hairbrush, try Eco Tools Shine Activating Hairbrush, $13.99. The brand boasts a range of combs and brushes for a variety of different hair types. Anti-Dandruff Treatments If you have dandruff, you’d be forgiven for spending more on a product, hoping that it’ll get rid of your flakes in one fell swoop. But cheaper products are just as effective. Trichologist Stephanie Sey recommends Nizoral’s Anti-Dandruff Treatment Shampoo, $14.99. “This starts working from the first wash to help treat the underlying cause of dandruff,” which is malassezia — an overgrowth of yeast (a type of fungus) on the scalp. This product boasts ketoconazole, which Sey explains is a powerful antifungal ingredient. It also boasts all-important sulphates (foaming agents that create a lather) to cleanse on a deeper level. When formulated properly, neither products with sulphates nor anti-dandruff shampoos should strip your scalp or hair. Smoothing Serums There are countless expensive balms, serums and creams for curls and coils, says Neil Moodie, editorial hairstylist and founder of Neil Moodie Studio. But one affordable alternative has become his favurite: “One of the best products [under $13] is the Mixed Chicks Straightening Serum,” he says. “We now also stock it in the Neil Moodie Studio. It has thermal protection, is humidity-resistant and cuts drying time in half.” Even better, Moodie says that this affordable serum works on both natural and relaxed hair, and reduces flyaways immediately. “This is all thanks to hydrolyzed keratin, silk amino acids, chamomile and rosemary extract,” he says. Styling Mousse Freelance beauty journalist and editor Ata-Owaji Victor thinks you can get away with spending less on styling mousse. Her go-to is Creme of Nature Argan Oil Style \u0026 Shine Foaming Mousse, $7.71. “This […] lasts forever and leaves my hair feeling nourished and shiny,” says Victor. “Black and coily hair doesn’t generally reflect light in the same way [as other hair textures] so I love that this adds some shine and gloss.” Victor says that it’s especially great for braids: “When you’ve got braids it’s hard to get nourishment into your hair in a way that doesn’t weigh it down or add buildup on the scalp. This is light yet keeps natural hair underneath fairly nourished. I put it on at the end of a braided style or cornrows.”  Hairspray Hair trend forecaster and stylist Tom Smith suggests spending less on hairspray — provided that you wash it out properly. “Even though hairspray can make hair feel stiff, it won’t actually dry the hair out,” he says. “This is because hairspray typically has a very high molecular weight, which means it simply sits on the surface of the hair and can’t get in.” Smith’s top tip? “Just don’t use direct heat — like curling or straightening irons — on top of cheaper hairspray, because that could cause residue, buildup and yellowing of the hair,” he says. One hair category Smith would never skimp on is hair treatments like bond-builders. “You’ll want the best quality ingredients to keep your hair healthy,” says Smith, an ambassador for Olaplex. If you have more to spend, try the new Olaplex No.5 Leave-In Moisturize \u0026 Mend Leave-In Conditioner, $32, which minimizes the appearance of split ends and further protects hair from damage as a result of brushing, heat-styling and environmental aggressors.   Dry Shampoo Award-winning beauty and wellness journalist Twiggy Jalloh says you can’t go wrong with Batiste dry shampoo. It’s particularly excellent for long hair and on wigs, she says. “I’ve tried almost every dry shampoo on the market and Batiste is still one of, if not the, best out of all of them,” praises Jalloh. “I love it for my straight hair; it blends in easily, absorbs oil really quickly, doesn’t leave behind a white powder and is very affordable. That’s important because when I have straight hair, I tend to go through dry shampoo quite quickly, so I don’t want to spend a huge amount.” Scalp Serums Alicia Lartey, esthetician, beauty writer and cosmetic chemist in-training says that scalp conditions such as excessive dryness and dandruff are pretty common. “I know that plenty of hairdressers will advise people to go for more expensive ‘professional’ treatments, but nowadays, there are more players in the game, and they’re formulating products at affordable price points,” she says. Lartey recommends looking out for the ingredient urea, an emollient (often found in moisturizers) that also softens and smooths the skin on the scalp. R29 rates The Ordinary’s Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid Scalp Serum, $14.70. Hair Oils Luxury and premium oils certainly have their place in haircare. (We’ve spoken highly of Kérastase Elixir Ultime L’Original Hair Oil, $62, for imparting shine, and love Olaplex No.7 Bonding Oil, $30, for minimizing the appearance of dry, split ends.) But having less to spend doesn’t mean forgoing quality. Stuart Marsh, a hairstylist in Taylor Taylor London‘s Liberty salon swears by Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Growth Oil, $10.99. He has a smart tip for making the most of its moisturizing ingredients: “Take a small, dry towel, dampen it down with water and add a few drops of the oil,” he advises. “Pop the towel in the microwave for about 30 seconds and while it’s warming up, run your favorite conditioner through your hair. Remove the towel and wrap it around the hair. Leave it on and there you have yourself an indulgent, super-intensive hair mask.” Shampoo “I recently tested a £43 luxury shampoo against a much cheaper version [L’Oréal Paris Elvive Hyaluron Plump Hydrating Squeeze Shampoo] and the cheaper one came out on top,” says Refinery29’s deputy beauty director, Jacqueline Kilikita. “Actually, in my experience, my hair has never felt cleaner — or looked better — when I’ve used drugstore brands like Elvive, Pantene, OGX and Hask. I want moisturizing ingredients like argan oil and hyaluronic acid, and a non-negotiable is a gentle sulphate to lift away all remnants of oil, hair product and daily dirt. While I’m very kindly sent lots of buzzy new shampoos, I always go back to Hydra Hyaluronic, and it’s often on sale at half the price.” Like what you see?

    "description": "Unless you have a short bob or a pixie cut, it's safe to say that you should consider adding a few updo styles into your hair rotation - and what's better than classic messy bun hairstyles? They'll keep your hair off your neck and out of your face, especially if you're dealing with dirty hair that hasn't seen a shampoo bottle in over a week. While you can always go for a ponytail, braid, or even half-up, half-down style, we love the simplicity of a messy bun hairstyle. The messy bun hairstyle trend offers a lot of versatility and can be worn for a variety of occasions, whether it's a wedding or a night in with friends. Despite having the word \"messy\" in the name, these styles look anything but unkempt. For a slightly more polished look, you can grab some gel, slick back your hair, and go for a low messy bun. On the other hand, a high messy bun is cute and flirty and can similarly be dressed up or down (just look at Pamela Anderson's style). Another reason to love this low-maintenance style is that you can easily sweep hair up and out of the way without using any heat styling tools or a copious number of styling products. You can get away with a few flyaways here and there, drastically cutting down the time you spend standing in front of a mirror. This updo can be achieved on all hair types, meaning you can find a messy bun tutorial for all textures and lengths. To help you gather some hair-bun inspiration, keep scrolling to see messy buns for long hair, curly hair, and more.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/skin-undertones-49320617",
    "description": "When it comes to choosing the most flattering makeup hues (and especially when finding a concealer or foundation shade), it's important to consider your skin's undertone: are you a warm, cool, or neutral? How it works is basic color theory: picking the right colors based on your hair color, eye color, and natural skin undertones will accentuate your features and make you glow. Still, learning how to tell your undertone isn't always the easiest task. Unless you're a professional makeup artist, it can be tricky to tell if you're actually warm-toned or cool-toned (or somewhere in between). Luckily, there are hacks to make it easier - and they don't include paying a visit to a makeup counter. We created an easy quiz below to help you uncover more about your complexion. By answering just six quick questions, you'll learn how to tell how to find your undertone, putting to rest the question you've been asking yourself once and for all. Warm Undertone Skin If you have a warm undertone, it typically means you have skin with yellow undertones, as well as gold and peach. This means makeup with brown, gold, and copper-toned shades look best on you. So if you're feeling stumped on eyeshadow colors to try, those are always a safe bet. It also means foundations that lean more yellow and golden will complement your skin color. With the latter, you can also look for the letter \"W\" before a number in the shade name. Cool Undertone Skin If you have cool skin undertones, you probably have hints of pink skin undertones, as well as blue. Equally cool colors, such as jewel tones in the blue, purple, and green color family will look especially flattering on you. Your best foundation match will also have a bluish or pink tint to it. To make it easy, some brands add the letter \"C\" before a number in the shade name to help people with cool undertones skin find the right color. Neutral Undertone Skin A neutral undertone is neither warm nor cool - it's right in the middle. This means that you have options in terms of colors. Every shade, no matter if it's warm or cool, will complement your skin tone. With foundations, specifically, you'll be able to choose either undertone family or go for the neutral category, which many beauty brands have started adding to their lineups in recent years with an \"N\" on the label. What Is My Undertone? If you're wondering how to find your undertone, this skin undertone test will help you determine if you're warm, cool, or neutral - plus, we'll offer helpful tips on making your makeup color selections a breeze. Note: it's best to do the following test in natural light (so move toward a window or go outside) with a freshly washed face. Also, pull your hair back and keep your shoulders bare so you get a true sense of your natural coloring. This is key for how to tell your skin undertone. So, what undertones do I have, you ask? Keep scrolling to find out. 1. Look at the inside of your wrist. What color do your veins predominately appear? A) More blue B) More green C) Hard to tell if they are blue or green 2. Picture yourself (or better yet, actually do it) in a yellow or orange shirt. How do you look? A) Not so great. Where's a blue top? B) Terrific - it gives me a great glow C) I can wear pretty much any color and look fine 3. What metal jewelry do you prefer on your skin? A) Silver B) Gold C) Either appeals to me! 4. Place a piece of white paper next to your bare face. How does your complexion look? A) Pretty good! I don't see any pronounced shadows here B) Pretty bad! My complexion is sallow and dull. Why did you make me do this? C) OK. Why am I holding this paper? 5. What happens to your skin when you are out in the sun without sunscreen? A) I burn - fast B) I tan C) I start with a tan but can burn if I stay out too long 6. What color flecks are in your eyes? A) Blue or gray B) A little bit of both C) Golden or hazel Results If You Got Mostly A's: You Have Cool Undertones If you fall into this category - like Billie Eilish, Anne Hathaway, and Lupita Nyong'o - try sticking to jewel-toned makeup and clothing, including blue, purple, blue-green, green, magenta, and bluish-red shades. For foundation, you'll probably look best in formulations with a bluish or pink undertone. And be sure to reach for the black, dark blue, or purple mascara when it comes to eye makeup: it's sure to make your eyes pop. Click over here to discover the makeup to buy and wear for cool undertones. If You Got Mostly B's: You Have Warm Undertones If you fall into this category - as celebrities like Jennifer Lopez and Beyoncé do - try sticking to earthier colors of makeup and clothing, such as yellow, orange, brown, orangey-reds, and yellow-green shades. For foundation, you'll probably look best in formulations with a yellow or golden undertone. And be sure to reach for the brick-red lipstick (as opposed to the bright blue-red) when it comes to a night out on the town: it's sure to make your complexion pop. Click over here to discover the makeup to buy and wear for warm undertones. If You Got Mostly C's: You Have Neutral Undertones Like Zendaya and Jennifer Aniston, you have neutral undertones, which means you can wear any shade that appeals to you. (Lucky you!) It's up to you if you prefer cooler makeup tones or warmer shades, so experiment with both to see what you like best, or switch it up depending on the jewelry or clothing you're wearing. Our best tip? Stay away from foundations that are geared for yellow skin tones - they'll make you look sallow. Experiment with rose gold shades since they have a little bit of warm and cool mixed in them.
