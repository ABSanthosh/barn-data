It‚Äôs the humble bow that is currently taking over Instagram feeds and flooding TikTok hair tutorials. Of course, bows and ribbons are nothing new; they‚Äôve adorned our hair for centuries. From the last queen of France, Marie Antoinette, whose hairdresser is said to have spent 20,000 francs on ribbons, to young women in the Victorian era, coquettish hair bows have proven enduringly popular. You know what they say, though: All beauty trends come full circle. Samantha Cusick,¬†hairstylist, podcast host and owner of her eponymous London salon chain, puts this 21st century resurgence down to Gossip Girl character Blair Waldorf, not to mention the rise of the ‚Äòquiet luxury‚Äô aesthetic. ‚ÄúUsing bows is the easiest way to look like you tried, without actually trying,‚Äù she says. It‚Äôs effortless. If you‚Äôre keen to try the trend but don‚Äôt know where to start, let TikTok‚Äôs beauty enthusiasts guide you. Here‚Äôs how to style the playful bow on all hair. How to style a bow on long hair @kylei.ann gaslighting myself into loving styling my hair #airwrap #hairbow #easyhairstyles #finehair #thinhairhairstyle ‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì kylei halbakken If your hair is on the straight side, make like TikToker Kylei Halbakken and give it a little texture and movement with a curling iron or hot tool. Halbakken uses the Dyson Airwrap, $599, to create tousles, but if you‚Äôd rather spend less, try the Shark FlexStyle Air Styling \u0026 Drying System, $249.99, or BaByliss Air Style 1000 Hot Air Multi Styler, $88. Run a brush through your lengths to loosen the curls into soft waves and pull a little hair oil through the mid-lengths and ends to add shine. Halbakken enlists Gisou Honey Infused Hair Oil, $46, but you can also try OGX Renewing+ Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil, $10.69. A half-up, half-down style is the easiest way to wear a bow on long lengths. Starting at your temples, use the tail end of a comb to gather half of your hair into a ponytail and fix in place with a small hair elastic, which will make tying your bow less of a chore. Halbakken ties a long piece of ribbon around the elastic, but you could fasten a bow-adorned barrette through the top section of your hair, just above the hair elastic.¬† If this style looks too princessy for you, then hair stylist Chl√∂e Swift Bow recommends teasing your roots to create a long and voluminous Brigitte Bardot-inspired pony, finishing with a ribbon or bow scrunchie tied around the base. How to style a bow on layered hair¬† @sanjureddyyyy bow hairstylesüéÄ #bowhairstyles #easyhairstyletutorials #bowhairtutorial #mediumlengthhairstyles #hairstyleideasforyou #grwmhair #hairstyles ‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì EX7STENCE‚Ñ¢ Take inspiration from TikToker Sanjana and section off the front of your hair on either side, so that it frames your face. Moving further inwards, Sanjana fashions a delicate braid on both sides, leaving around two inches of hair free at the end. Secure your plait with a hair elastic, like Kitsch No-Snag Clear Elastics, $3. Now for the ribbon, which you can find on Etsy or at your local craft store. The key is making sure it‚Äôs long enough to tie easily. Cut off a piece that is around seven inches long to begin with ‚Äî you can always trim the ends to suit your preferences. Simply tie the ribbon around each hair elastic and pull tight so that it doesn‚Äôt unravel. A veil of strong-hold hairspray over the bow will keep it in place for longer.¬† How to style a bow on short hair @kylaleelee day 8 of the 10 days of short hairstyles series üíù super easy \u0026 cutesy! #shorthairstyles #shorthair #easyhairstyles #bowhairstyles #shorthairstyleideas #hairinspo #shorthairinspo #shorthaircut #quickhairstyles #10daysofhairstyles #shorthaircut ‚ô¨ som original ‚Äì chica TikToker Kyla Lee is proof that a hair bow looks just as good on a bob haircut. If you have face-framing bangs like Lee, give it some bounce with a roller, like Drybar High Tops Self-Grip Rollers, $12. Lee gathers small sections of their hair from either side, twists them and then ties them together at the back using a hair elastic. Finally, you‚Äôll need a bow clip with a barrette fastening. Lee passes the open barrette clip just underneath the hair elastic and pins it into place. A chunky bow will complement a shorter cut like this.

Enlist both a hair tie and bobby pins to keep it tight. You could tie a ribbon around the low bun, but a bow with a barrette clip or scrunchie requires less effort. Fasten yours just above the bun so that the bow tails tumble down over it.¬† How to style a bow on curly hair @curlyhairstylesandtips #curls #curlytiktok #curlyhairstyles #bowhairstyle #curlmagic #naturalcurls #curlyhairtutorial #curlyhairstyle #bowhairclips #cutehairstyles #easyhairstyles ‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Curlswithlove ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about letting the texture do its thing,‚Äù says Cusick. Look to TikToker @curlswithlove for inspiration, who makes a case for letting her natural curls shine in a half-up-half-down style. Use your thumbs to gather approximately half of your hair up, so that it resembles a ponytail. You can tie this up using a hair tie or hold this section in place with one hand and pass your barrette clip bow underneath with the other. Pull out some curly tendrils to frame your face and dial up the coquette effect.¬† @itsmikaylanicolee Hair Inspo 01| Pigtails with RibbonsüéÄü´∂üèΩ #hairinspo #hairbowtutorial #fallhairstyles #curls ‚ô¨ Last Christmas (Pudding Mix) ‚Äì Wham! If your hair is long, take cue from TikToker Mikayla Nicole: Part your hair in the middle, section the front into two ponytails, fix with a hair tie and grace with a bow on each side.¬† How to style a bow on medium-length hair @adelialaughs The bows üéÄüéÄ #mediumhairstyles #slickbackhairstyle #bowhairstyle ‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì ùëµùë®ùëªùë™ùë∫ùë≥ùëºùëΩùëπ‚ù¶ Mid-length haircuts are far from boring ‚Äî but they‚Äôre even better with a bow. After a generous helping of hair cream (try Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream, $36, or Lee Stafford Grow Strong \u0026 Long Protein Treatment Styling Cream, $14.59), TikToker Adelia whips their hair up into a high ponytail, fashions a chunky braid and ties a short, black ribbon around the base and end for a look that‚Äôs sophisticated and playful in equal measure. If you think you might struggle to knot the perfect bow, use a bow-adorned hair tie to make this style easier to recreate at home.

Passing that big, bold barrette bow clip through your hair just above the base of the ponytail is the cherry on top.¬† How to style a bow on fine hair @alyssarayelee Step by step for this viral bow hairstyle!! #shorthairstyles #finehairstyles #hairstyleinspo #hairhack #hairtrends ‚ô¨ Maria Maria (feat. The Product G\u0026B) (sped up) ‚Äì Santana \u0026 sped up + slowed TikToker Alyssa has a hack for styling fine hair. Using a fine tooth comb like Maison Pearson Tail Comb, $34, take a section of hair from the front and rake it back, then fasten in the middle with a clear hair elastic. Using your fingers, hollow out a section at the base, just above the elastic and loop the ends through the space. Repeat on the other side. This should create the illusion of four sections of hair. All you need now is a long ribbon to pass through the gaps and tie into a bow. If you find your hair is too fine and slippery to hold a bow, Chl√∂e suggests adding texture and grip with a dry shampoo or texture spray, like ARKIVE Headcare The Reset Dry Shampoo, $13.50, or Living Proof Full Dry Volume \u0026 Texture Spray, $24.61.¬†¬† Like what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Whether your¬†hair¬†grows at a snail‚Äôs pace or you‚Äôre keen to treat¬†sparse patches, it‚Äôs likely that in your quest for¬†thicker,¬†longer lengths, you will have come across dozens of articles and tutorials extolling the virtues of many supposedly impressive ingredients. There‚Äôs folic acid (also known as vitamin B9),¬†castor oil¬†(now found in countless high street hair treatments) and TikTok‚Äôs new favorite, rosemary oil (apparently like Miracle-Gro for your lengths). Just how many of these things are actually proven to work, and which ones rely solely on anecdotal evidence? We looked to¬†Hannah Gaboardi, trichologist at¬†The Hair Growth Clinic, and¬†Angela Onuoha, trichologist and cosmetic chemist, for their thoughts on the most Googled lotions, potions and natural ingredients touted to make your hair grow thicker and faster. DashDividers_1_500x100 What causes hair loss, thinning, and slow hair growth? It‚Äôs totally normal to lose hair (we tend to shed 50-100 strands a day, according to the¬†NHS) and usually it‚Äôs nothing to be worried about ‚Äî unless it‚Äôs getting you down. Angela explains that stress is the number one cause of hair loss. ‚ÄúStress causes your body to constantly be in survival mode,‚Äù says Angela, ‚Äúand that has a long-term effect on your hair, since it isn‚Äôt prioritised by the body when it comes to survival.‚Äù But hair loss or thinning can often be a sign of a¬†medical condition, such as alopecia areata (unpredictable patches of hair loss). Weight loss, iron deficiency, polycystic ovary syndrome and illness are just a handful of other causes of hair loss and thinning. It‚Äôs best to visit your doctor or a registered trichologist for tailored advice. DashDividers_1_500x100 Is rosemary oil good for hair growth? On TikTok there are over 170.9K posts tagged under¬†#rosemaryoil, with the majority of videos talking about it in relation to hair health and accelerated growth. Hannah says she ‚Äúswears by‚Äù the ingredient for reducing hair fall, and lots of¬†anecdotal evidence¬†suggests that massaging¬†rosemary oil¬†into the scalp on a regular basis helps to fill out the hairline and encourages growth in sparse patches. But at the moment, it‚Äôs just that ‚Äî anecdotal. ‚ÄúSo far [the benefits of rosemary oil for hair growth have] not been scientifically proven on humans,‚Äù says Angela, referring to¬†a study¬†on mice, where rosemary oil was used to speed up hair growth. Angela explains that there has been a human study, albeit only on 28 people, each one of whom had a scalp condition called alopecia areata (an autoimmune disorder which results in patchy hair loss). Hair loss caused by alopecia areata is very different from other types of hair loss or slow growth so the findings were limited. ‚ÄúSo far, when it comes to science there is no proof,‚Äù says Angela of rosemary oil. @thehealthyhur The girls who get it GET ITTTTT #greenscreen #hairloss #rosemarywater #rosemaryoil ‚ô¨ Forever ‚Äì Labrinth All is not lost, though. It could be that the act of regularly massaging oil into the scalp is the catalyst that stimulates new hair cells. Hannah praises¬†scalp massagers¬†in particular. ‚ÄúYou can use rosemary oil by massaging it into your scalp for five minutes and leaving it on for a minimum of 15 minutes,‚Äù she says. Hannah also rates rosemary oil for its antibacterial benefits for the scalp and hair. Plus, it can be very nourishing on dry hair strands. That‚Äôs why brands like¬†Pacifica,¬†Innersense¬†and¬†R+Co¬†are infusing it into shampoos and conditioners. When it comes to hair growth, however, the science just isn‚Äôt there. DashDividers_1_500x100 Is castor oil good for hair growth? Castor oil is a vegetable oil derived from castor beans. It has highly moisturizing properties ‚Äî particularly for natural hair, which tends to be drier ‚Äî but Hannah and Angela agree that it will not stimulate hair growth. There is no scientific evidence to suggest otherwise, despite TikTok coming through with¬†countless anecdotes. If your hair is very dry, Hannah says that occasionally using castor oil can help maintain its health but the oil is notoriously thick and can create buildup, causing your lengths and scalp to become greasy quickly. If you‚Äôre still swayed by the ingredient, try it in a pre-wash treatment designed to be used before shampoo to ensure the lather doesn‚Äôt strip your hair and scalp completely, like¬†Fable \u0026 Mane HoliRoots Hair Oil, $38. R29 also rates¬†Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen \u0026 Restore Hair Treatment Mask, $12.97, and¬†Philip Kingsley Elasticizer Deep Conditioning Treatment, $31, which are both rinse-off treatments and condition hair deeply. DashDividers_1_500x100 Are peptides good for hair growth? Peptides are little proteins, and proteins can regenerate both skin and hair. There are lots of different peptides, some that work on the hair and some that are better for the skin. In haircare, you‚Äôre likely to hear a buzz around copper peptides and pea protein in particular. ‚ÄúCertain peptides fight inflammation,‚Äù explains Hannah. ‚ÄúWhen inflammation occurs on the scalp, it can impact the growth phase of your hair.‚Äù Some peptides can soothe this inflammation, nipping hair loss in the bud. Hannah rates pea peptides in particular for helping to smooth the hair follicle and providing fullness, making hair soft and shiny. ‚ÄúPea protein has essential vitamins and minerals, such as iron and calcium,‚Äù says Hannah, ‚Äúwhich help boost hair quality and improve hair growth.‚Äù¬†She adds that the production of keratin, which makes hair strong, can be boosted with the help of pea protein. Not only will this repair the hair but it also promotes healthy new hairs and protects them from environmental aggressors like pollution and heat. Try¬†Philip Kingsley Density Thickening Protein Spray, $56, or¬†VIRTUE Flourish Density Booster, $50. Hannah is personally a fan of¬†OUAI Scalp Serum, $52, which features acetyl tetrapeptide-3, which¬†studies¬†conclude increases hair growth. R29 also rates¬†The Ordinary Multi-Peptide Serum For Hair Density, $22.80, which boasts multiple peptides and caffeine to boost hair density. The incredible reviews speak for themselves. DashDividers_1_500x100 Is argan oil good for hair growth? Studies show that¬†argan oil¬†is effective at protecting hair from damage caused by environmental aggressors such as pollution and UV. It‚Äôs why you‚Äôll spot the ingredient in so many hair products. But just like castor oil, there is hardly any data to suggest that it helps with hair growth. For smooth, protected hair, opt instead for a leave-in conditioner containing argan oil, such as¬†HASK Argan Oil 5 in 1 Leave in Conditioner, $6.97. If your hair needs more moisture, treat your strands (not your scalp) to something like¬†OGX Renewing+ Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil, $10.69, before styling or air-drying. It makes hair soft and smooth. Angela agrees that using an oil to lock in moisture is the perfect way to give a nice coating to your hair, preventing damage. ‚ÄúIt also makes the hair easier to manage,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúand gives it an amazing shine. I personally love the¬†Rhyme \u0026 Reason Argan Oil Smooth Finishing Serum, $12.80, since it‚Äôs super lightweight but so nourishing.‚Äù DashDividers_1_500x100 Is minoxidil good for hair growth? You might‚Äôve come across minoxidil in your hair growth endeavors. As it stands, this is one of the only¬†scientifically proven¬†ingredients to stimulate hair growth and, happily, it‚Äôs available in various high street drugstores,¬†as well as online. So what exactly is it? ‚ÄúMinoxidil is a vasodilator,‚Äù explains Angela, ‚Äúand this means that it widens the blood vessels to deliver more oxygen-rich blood to the hair follicles.‚Äù Angela adds that lots of people who are dealing with hair loss need more oxygen to the affected areas to stimulate hair growth. She says that minoxidil is used to spot-treat areas of baldness or a receding hairline, since it stimulates those areas and slows down further balding. It‚Äôs the active ingredient in the popular over-the-counter product¬†Rogaine. DashDividers_1_500x100 Is folic acid good for hair growth? Hannah says that folic acid ‚Äî also known as vitamin B9 ‚Äî is necessary for hair health. Angela explains that it is found in our food, such as spinach, beans, peas, citrus fruit, liver and grains. Unless you‚Äôre deficient in the vitamin, you‚Äôre probably getting enough from your diet. ‚ÄúEverything that you‚Äôre adding to your diet will end up in your pee,‚Äù says Angela of hair growth supplements which contain folic acid. ‚ÄúYour body only absorbs what it needs.‚Äù If you‚Äôre worried about deficiency, Angela suggests getting your bloodwork checked before self-diagnosing the condition of your hair using supplements. The same goes for¬†biotin (or vitamin B7). ‚ÄúThere has been a huge trend for biotin in hair growth recently,‚Äù says Angela. ‚ÄúThe funny thing is, I‚Äôve never had a client who ended up having a biotin deficiency. In fact, humans rarely have it.‚Äù DashDividers_1_500x100 Is washing your hair regularly good for hair growth? Hannah believes that using a shampoo regularly helps to keep the scalp clean. In turn, removing oil and debris from the scalp can promote hair growth. Angela agrees that starting off with good scalp health ‚Äî and particularly a clean scalp ‚Äî is key. ‚ÄúSince the scalp is the soil your hair grows on, you want it to be in the best healthy state,‚Äù she explains. Angela likes a gentle cleanser like¬†Rhyme \u0026 Reason Nourish \u0026 Gloss Shampoo, $7.88. ‚ÄúThis contains hyaluronic acid, which is an amazing ingredient to keep the scalp moisturized and supple,‚Äù she says. If your hair is dry and damaged by heat, bleach or dye, try¬†Rhyme \u0026 Reason Repair \u0026 Restore Shampoo, $10.99. Lastly, a leave-in conditioner is key to make sure your hair stays moisturized between washes, says Angela. She likes¬†Rhyme \u0026 Reason Quench \u0026 Curl Leave In Conditioner, $9.99, for curly hair. R29 also rates¬†Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Joia Milky Leave-in Conditioner, $28, or¬†Aussie Hair Insurance Leave In Hair Conditioner Spray, $5.99, if you‚Äôre on a budget.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/scent-beauty-sabrina-carpenter-espresso-perfume-review-49412912",
    "description": "Oh to bottle up the way Sabrina Carpenter's \"Espresso\" made me feel this summer. The radio domination! The endless memes! Me neurotically murmuring the track's nonsense chorus all day: \"That's that me espresso.\" (I'm still trying to unpack whatever that line means.) Alas, as summer 2024's unofficial anthem, not only did the ballad top my Spotify Wrapped reports, it also accompanied some of my fondest memories of the year. And as 2024 comes to a close, Carpenter is helping nostalgia-starved fans tap into memories inspired by the hit song with a perfume that pays homage to its caffeine-infused roots. Scent Beauty's Me Espresso Eau de Parfum ($60) is the latest in a long line of fragrance collaborations between the pop star and perfume brand, though I'd argue this launch might be their most decadent to date. Much like her \"Espresso\" song, Carpenter's Espresso Perfume plays into a sweet yet sultry vibe, with rich notes like cocoa powder and espresso bean that are so evocative, they'll have you feeling like you were steeped in a pool of Italian dark roast. Ahead, I break down what this new Sabrina Carpenter perfume smells like, how it compares to other celebrity fragrances, and why the mocha mousse color trend might hint at it being 2025's hottest scent. About Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso Perfume This perfume features notes of espresso bean, cocoa powder, vanilla orchid, sugared amber, and jasmine, among others. It's available in one 2.5 ounce size. The perfume is one of several that have been created through Sabrina Carpenter's partnership with Scent Beauty; others include a Sweet Tooth Cherry Baby Perfume and Sweet Tooth Caramel Perfume. What I Like About Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso Perfume Given that my fragrance preferences tend to lean toward notes like smoky vanilla or sandalwood, I was admittedly skeptical before trying this Scent Beauty perfume. I've always found that caffeine- or food-scented fragrances bordered between being delicious and downright tacky; hence why I was so surprised to find that this pop star-approved perfume smells... rather delightful. While it's infused with decadent notes like cocoa powder and espresso bean, the scent is heavy on its jasmine fragrance (a welcome surprirse) while lighter fragrances like vanilla and amber help to balance the aroma out. Carpenter's perfume is sweet without being overwhelming, with a balminess that reminds me of a powdery, brown-sugar latte as opposed to a stark espresso scent. While I'm less of an expert on fragrance-layering, other shoppers - namely reviewers on Scent Beauty's site - also claim that it's a fantastic perfume to layer with other scents. One user even wrote: \"I love wearing it by itself but I sprayed a lavender vanilla body spray on top and it was heavenly! Like a vanilla lavender latte!\" Another thing that I really appreciate about this espresso perfume is its long-lasting scent. A little goes a long way: I usually only need a spritz or two on my wrists and neck in order to really lock in the fragrance, then I'm good for the rest of the day. I've also received endless compliments since I started wearing the perfume, many coming hours after I first sprayed it - another testament to its longevity. Plus, with the mocha mousse color trend predicted to dominate 2025, I'm convinced this espresso perfume might wind up being the year's hottest fragrance. What to Consider Before Trying Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso Perfume As far as celebrity perfumes go, this fragrance is pricier than some other market options (for example, Ariana Grande's Cloud Perfume and Kylie Jenner's Kylie Fragrance retail for about $48). But based off of its unique scent and long-lasting smell, I'd say that it's worth the price. If you're in the market for something more affordable, you can shop out other celebrity perfumes or fragrances with similar espresso scents. Where Is Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso Perfume Available? This celebrity perfume is available to shop at Scent Beauty.

    "description": "Shiny, lustrous nails have dominated the beauty world in recent years, largely due to Hailey Bieber's iconic glazed-doughnut era and the expertise of her go-to nail artist, Zola Ganzorigt.

To narrow it down, professionals and beauty editors carefully evaluated and reviewed the most popular options on the market. Standout features like texture, durability, and vibrant glitter payoff were looked at, ensuring these picks deliver on both style and staying power. Whether it's a subtle shimmer layered over an opaque base color or a bold, full-coverage glitter moment, ahead, check out the best glitter nail polishes available. According to the professionals, these polishes are worth your money and will elevate any manicure this season.",
