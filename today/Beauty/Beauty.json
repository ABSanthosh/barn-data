Though they all look incredible, they’re also pretty high maintenance.  For those who aren’t too keen on booking in for a monthly trim, a mid-length cut might be your best bet. Far from mediocre, the in-between length isn’t only much easier to keep sharp – it’s also being touted as one of the biggest hair trends for 2025. “Mid-length cuts don’t have to feel like a long, grown out bob,” says Jordan Jones, stylist and color technician at Taylor Taylor London. “This year we’re being shown that they can be their own style with layers and careful shaping to create volume and movement, or shine and sophistication. If your bob has grown out and your hair has reached that awkward-length stage, or if you’ve got long locks and fancy a change without going super short, a trendy mid-length style is the cut for you.” On Instagram, London’s most sought-after stylists The Hair Bros are also championing medium-length cuts with curtain bangs, concave layers and natural waves. It seems we’ve all got the same idea: Google search for mid-length haircuts has risen by 180% recently and countless TikTokers are dedicating entire videos to mid-length haircut transformations. So which style will suit you best? Ahead, London’s best stylists reveal the biggest mid-length haircut trends that everyone can wear. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Mid-Length Drape View this post on Instagram A post shared by Francesca Inverarity (@frankie_inv) Curtain bangs are going nowhere fast but according to editorial hairstylist and presenter Neil Moodie, you might want to cancel your fringe trim, because it’s increasingly cool to let it grow out a little. “Grown-out curtain fringes are great and can make mid-length hair look more interesting,” he says. The more grown out the fringe, the easier it is to blend into the rest of your hair, particularly if you’re interested in getting a handful of layers to enhance volume and texture, like this style colored by The Hair Bros’ Francesca on Instagram. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Jagged Lob View this post on Instagram A post shared by BLEACH (@bleachlondon) “As the bob and long bobs have been around for a while, I feel like fringes are making a comeback,” says Neil. “The type of fringe I mean almost looks a bit homemade and very individual. It’s slightly jagged on the ends and a little uneven.” Take a cue from this pink style, dyed by Kat Gawel at BLEACH Brixton. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Mane View this post on Instagram A post shared by Francesca Inverarity (@frankie_inv) You’ve heard of the wolf cut (a variation on the shag, occupying a space between wild and relaxed) but ‘the mane’ is a lot more voluminous. “This is super edgy with lots of texture and a heavy fringe that needs to be worn long and in the eyes so it has plenty of movement,” explains Jordan Jones, stylist and color technician at Taylor Taylor London. “The face-framing layers of this cut make it perfect for adding texture and volume to the hair while defining the face.” So what should you ask for? “A choppy cut with plenty of layers that frame the face and create soft movement,” says Jordan. “Think Billie Eilish and Miley Cyrus’s shaggy ‘dos.” Jordan says the look works well with any hair texture. “Sea salt products are a must-have to give an effortless, freshly tousled finishing touch.” Take inspiration from this look by Francesca Inverarity. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Mid-Length Afro View this post on Instagram A post shared by Charlotte Mensah (@charlottemensah) “As we move into spring and summer I think we’ll be seeing a lot more natural afro and curly hair in medium lengths,” says celebrity hairdresser Lorraine Dublin, much like this beautiful, fluffed out afro and these bold blonde curls, both created by hair artist Charlotte Mensah. “In the colder months, hair thrives better in protective styles, so as the weather heats up we’ll be seeing afro hair in its natural state — with bold colors, too.” DashDividers_1_500x100 The Half Up, Half Down View this post on Instagram A post shared by dylan bradshaw DUBLIN (@dylanbradshawdublin) “Another trend that will continue to be popular is the half up, half down style,” says Lorraine, “especially with hair extensions.” She continues: “You can add an ombre hair color to the ends and combine this with a natural, soft, body wave.” Gemma Murphy from Dylan Bradshaw Dublin totally nails the cute in-between style here. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Collarbone Cut View this post on Instagram A post shared by BLUE TIT – HAIR SALONS (@bluetitlondon) “The collarbone cut is so popular right now,” says Tyler Moore, stylist at Live True London. He prefers a blunt edge and no layering but the look works equally well with a little bit of texture. “This style can be paired with a fringe for an ultra chic look and it works great on both straight and wavy or textured hair.” We love this look created by afro and textured hair educator Sharley Viola. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Flip View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Hair Bros (@thehairbros) “This is a versatile mid-length cut,” said The Hair Bros on Instagram. “When approaching a mid-length haircut there are a few points that we feel make all the difference. 1) Adding a substantial amount of shape around the face. 2) Cutting ‘accidental’, piecey layers throughout the hair.” The Hair Bros say a mid-length cut is its own style and that it’s important not to leave all of the hair one length. “This will end up looking heavy, as if it were a shorter bob. A middy hair cut should be full of texture and life and feel fun and playful. It’s great for anyone that wants to cut their long hair short but isn’t quite ready to brave a bob.” Flip your hair to one side for more of a natural, lived in feel. “As always, just a few products and some air should be enough to style this cut,” added The Hair Bros. Use a little styling cream like Hairstory Hair Balm, $37, and rough-dry with a hairdryer on low or medium heat. DashDividers_1_500x100 The ’90s Lob View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mijael Bickei (@studiobickei) The ’90s lob (aka long bob) is going to be everywhere soon, says Tyler. “This is a layered, mid-length long bob à la Rachel from Friends. Think of it as a more retro twist on the wolf cut with slightly longer layers and a sleeker texture.” Dreamed up by Mijael Bickei on Instagram, this lob is both glossy and textured. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Hi-Shine Lob View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝐒 𝐄 𝐕 𝐀 𝐍 𝐀 (@seva_glam_hair) “Embrace modern glamour with a super blunt cut with clean, sharp lines,” says Jordan, like this cut created by Sevana at Salon 26° North. “This style looks best when cut around the collarbone and is perfectly set off with mirror-shine hair.” This is all about the condition of your hair so make sure to use hydrating and nourishing conditioners or oils to create a super sleek style. Kérastase Elixir Ultime L’Original Hair Oil, $62, is a favorite among stylists. “If you are a brunette or darker, ask for a gloss color to add depth and shine,” adds Jordan. “Even opting for a Brazilian blow-dry or straightening treatment will help to put the finishing touches on this look.” DashDividers_1_500x100 Lived-In Lengths View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝑅𝓊𝒷𝓎 𝒯𝓊𝑒𝓈𝒹𝒶𝓎 𝐸𝓋𝑒𝓇𝓈 (@didntcatchthat) “Why is shoulder-length hair commonly perceived to be bad?” wrote The Hair Bros on Instagram. “It’s not!” This modern mid-length cut by hairstylist Liam Russell on Ruby Tuesday Evers has inspired the Bros’ work in-salon over the past few months. The bedhead texture and mussed up fringe give the medium length great shape. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Top-Heavy Cut View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝕰𝖒𝖎𝖑𝖞 𝕶𝖎𝖓𝖌𝖘𝖙𝖔𝖓 (@lemzkingston) The shag, the mullet, the shullet… Whatever you call the ‘00s most popular cut, it always seems to be evolving, as illustrated by Emily Kingston, stylist and colorist at Blue Tit Clapton. Proving the cut looks just as incredible on curly hair, the trick is to emphasize lots of volume around the top of the head and taper the lengths right down to the bottom so that hair sits just below the collarbone. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Side Fringe View this post on Instagram A post shared by James Samuel (@jamesjustnow) The side fringe perfectly accentuates a mid-length cut, says Jordan, like this style on model Julia Campbell-Gillies at Hershesons in London. “Curtain bangs have moved on and side bangs from the early ’00s are back. For fringe lovers who want a bit more excitement this year, this style flatters most face shapes and essentially frames the face with disconnected, slightly longer bangs. It’s not dramatic and easy to tuck behind your ear, pin to one side or sweep across the forehead with a big, bouncy blow-dry.” Jordan says it looks great on wavy, thicker hair in particular, styled as if it’s been casually flipped over. “To keep it on trend it’s best worn loose and tousled. Add spritzes of dry shampoo on the roots for second-day hair to amplify the volume and add a bit of texture.” Like what you see?

    "description": "When shopping for beauty products, it’s easy to gravitate to specialty stores like Sephora and Ulta, where where every aisle is dedicated to all things beauty. However, there’s one retailer that always claims a sizable chunk of my paycheck (just consult my order histories) — and that’s Nordstrom. Having grown up in the heyday of mall culture, I spent endless hours among the impeccably-lit displays at my local Nordstrom counter, swatching and spritzing to my heart’s content. Highly-anticipated Anniversary Sale aside, the iconic department store is home to, in my humble opinion, one of the best beauty selections in the country — an accolade I don’t throw around lightly. From niche fragrance brands to the latest in beauty tech, Nordstrom’s curation of hair care, makeup, skincare products — and more — is top-tier. (Plus, the retailer’s loyalty program often runs special point multiplier events on its beauty and fragrance assortment, allowing you to rack up rewards fast.)But hey, don’t just take my word for it . Below, I asked R29’s discerning group of editors to divulge the best brands to shop at Nordstrom — here are their ultimate favorites. At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff. All of our market picks are independently selected and curated by the editorial team. All product details reflect the price and availability at the time of publication. If you buy or click on something we link to on our site, Refinery29 may earn commission. Victoria Beckham Beauty Lid Lustre Eyeshadow\"I recently tested a bunch of products from Victoria Beckham Beauty, and was so blown away by the brand. In addition to feeling so luxurious and timeless (the tortoiseshell packaging feels like it’s from a different time!), the quality of the formulas is really on another level. Like MAC, the brand has also been very selective of its retail presence, but recently announced that it was entering Nordstrom’s rarified beauty assortment. My choice pick that I highly recommend you swatch IRL at your local Nordstrom store is Lid Lustre eyeshadow, a dazzling, shimmery way to gild lids in a single swipe. (Photos truly don’t do it justice!)\" — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior WriterVictoria Beckham Beauty Lid Lustre Eyeshadow, $, available at NordstromCharlotte Tilbury Glowgasm Beauty Wand Highlighter\"If I had to use just one makeup brand, I’d probably choose Charlotte Tilbury. It has everything — even skincare to prep your base — and having met Charlotte herself recently, I now know just how much time, effort and research goes into each and every product. I was so impressed. My all time favorite, though, has to be the Glowgasm Beauty Wand Highlighter (especially the shade Peachgasm), which I use as a cream blush. Unlike others, which are packed with chunky, glittery pigments, this is so finely-milled and appears like a glossy filter on the skin. Best of all, it doesn’t budge until you see fit to remove it at the end of the day. I’ve used a handful of these right down to the last drop — they’re that good.\" — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty DirectorCharlotte Tilbury Glowgasm Beauty Wand Highlighter, $, available at NordstromChanel BAUME ESSENTIEL Multi-Use Glow Stick\"When I think of the Nordstrom beauty floor, Chanel is the first name that comes to mind. I have such fond memories of visiting the counter with my mom, marveling at the elegant jars, iconic lipsticks, and indulging in tiny samples of their decadent creams on my baby-soft skin. Even now, Nordstrom remains my go-to destination for the ultimate in luxury beauty, whether I’m restocking a classic Chanel fragrance or picking up a must-have Baume Essential. And for those of you who aren’t familiar with the latter, it’s essentially the grown-up version of a highlighter – the chicest, most subtle way to add light and dimension to your face, IMHO.\" — Sara Tan, Global Beauty DirectorChanel BAUME ESSENTIEL Multi-Use Glow Stick, $, available at NordstromD.S. \u0026 Durga Big Sur Eucalyptus Eau de Parfum\"Every cool beauty editor I know has a D.S. \u0026 Durga perfume in their collection. The Brooklyn-based brand’s ethos is rooted in “armchair travel” — aka how a certain smell can transport you back to a very specific time and place — and its creations are all fittingly interesting and unique. My recent favorite has been Big Sur Eucalyptus, a woody cypress scent that takes me right back to my hiking trip to Alishan Mountain in Taiwan last year. I love taking big breaths as I spray this on my pulse points, as the refreshing whiffs of green apple and eucalyptus never fail to open up my chest.\" — Venus Wong, Senior WriterD.S. \u0026 Durga Big Sur Eucalyptus Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromWestman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick\"If you know me, you know I am a hardcore Westman Atelier fan. I own most of the brands products from contour sticks, to glowy highlighters, and natural mascaras, and its products totally align with my barely there makeup preferences. I also find the formulas don’t trigger my sensitive skin. Plus, the packaging is so chic, minimal, and just feels luxe, I’ve given so many of the brand’s liquid lip balms as gifts throughout the years. The first Westman item I bought was the Face Trace Contour Stick. I love the shade ‘Biscuit’ because it has a cooler understone so it doesn’t appear orange like some other contour or bronzing products I’ve tried. The texture is also so creamy and melts into the skin easily. It looks so natural I’ll usually just blend it over my tinted sunscreen — no foundation or concealer required.\" — Kate Spencer, Senior Affiliate Partnerships ManagerWestman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick, $, available at NordstromMAC Cosmetics MACximal Silky Matte Lipstick\"MAC Cosmetics has always been strategic with its retail partnerships. For most of its four decades of being in business, you could only shop them at MAC stores or on the brand’s website. Nowadays, they are still only in a few retailers – and Nordstrom is among the rare few. After all these years, the artistry-focused brand still makes some of the most innovative, high-performing products around. My latest favorite: the Macximal Silky Matte lipstick, which combines the bold pigmentation and matte finish of the brand’s Retro Matte lipsticks in a silky, non-drying (!) formula.\" — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior WriterMAC Cosmetics MACximal Silky Matte Lipstick, $, available at NordstromTata Harper Retinoic Nutrient Face Oil\"I discovered Tata Harper when I worked as a travel editor at a newspaper. So many luxury hotels on my bucket list (The Lanesborough Hotel in London, Le Coucou Meribel in the French Alps, and Gleneagles in Scotland, just to name a few) feature Tata Harper facials on their spa menus. After sampling its Retinoic Nutrient Face Oil, I’m now crystal clear on why the brand has received so much love from five-star stays: The texture is rich without making my skin feel like an oil slick, and it's packed with natural retinoids derived from rosehip. I love massaging this into my face with my fingertips after my usual skincare routine, and I wake up with plumper and brighter skin the next day.\" — Venus Wong, Senior WriterTata Harper Retinoic Nutrient Face Oil, $, available at NordstromLike what you see?

    "title": "I Wish I Had a Barbie Like the Aaliyah Doll Growing Up",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/aaliyah-barbie-black-girls-essay-49423439",
    "description": "Growing up, I, like many girls, had a Barbie doll. From her spunky outfits and fun hairstyles to her various professions, the iconic toy was as much of a source of empowerment as it was enjoyment. The doll's manufacturer, Mattel, has created many different versions of Barbie over the years, but the latest is one I wish I could've personally experienced growing up. On Jan. 16, Mattel released a new Barbie honoring the late R\u0026B princess, Aaliyah. Seeing this creation immediately filled me with a sense of happiness - but I also felt a great longing for a doll like this during my formative years. The now-sold-out Aaliyah Barbie - which came out on what would have been the singer's 46th birthday - is the latest in Mattel's Music Series, made in collaboration with the singer's brother, Rashad Haughton. Since Aaliyah lost her life in a horrific plane crash in 2001 at only 22 years old, Haughton has remained steadfast in preserving his sister's legacy, especially through many major collaborations (including one with MAC in 2018), but this one with Mattel hit me differently. Although I was only 3 years old when the singer passed, I was always inspired by her, especially as I entered my high school years. I loved her style, her effortless yet distinct approach to beauty through side parts and inner winged eyeliner - her whole élan. From Bratz to Barbies, I loved playing with my dolls, giving them different roles, putting them in my toy cars, sliding them down my grandmother's stairs, and imagining my own little world. Trips to the toy aisles of Target and Toys R US were also part of the childhood escapades I highly anticipated. In hindsight, I realize that the majority of the dolls I owned and saw in stores did not look like me - an experience many Black girls can relate to. Image Source: Getty/Photo by Sal Idriss/Redferns When I was younger, many of Barbie's collections were exclusionary to Black people, with most of these dolls being white with either blond or brunette hair. There were exceptions here and there, but even many of those dolls tokenized Black people and garnered significant criticism (a particular Oreo-themed Black Barbie made in the '90s comes to mind. . .). While I loved all of my Barbies equally, none were a true reflection of me or the woman I would become. I grew up in Brooklyn, which was a melting pot of different cultures and particularly welcoming for my migrant Jamaican family, so I wasn't aware that there was a world that didn't always embrace my people. Confidence and pride in identity were always pushed in my home environment, so I didn't experience racial stereotyping or prejudice as a child. My family and friends didn't make me feel unpretty or that my Blackness was an inferior alternative, but the toy shelves did. Our relationship with beauty doesn't just begin when we put on our mother's red lipstick for the first time. It begins from the moment we enter the world, with the people we're around, the places we see, and the conversations we hear influencing the way we look at ourselves. The young mind is sharper than we think, with many experiences having a lasting impact, which is why having a Black doll like Aaliyah would have been so monumental for me to grow up with. While her beauty is awe-inspiring, it's bigger than her physicality. Aaliyah was a Black woman who succeeded simply by being herself and showing up fearlessly, and it's gratifying to see Mattel release her doll, not just to preserve her legacy, but for young Black girls to see their beauty is also valued.
