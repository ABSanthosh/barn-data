    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cos-perfumery-fragrance-collection-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "If you’re anything like us, your wardrobe is probably anchored by a handful of staples from COS. The brand is known for its minimalist aesthetic — think crisp button-down shirts and flowy maxi dresses — that makes getting dressed feel effortless. Now it’s aiming to bring that same signature touch to your dressing table with its first-ever fragrance launch. The COS Perfumery collection features four gender-neutral scents formulated in Grasse, France — also known as the perfume capital of the world, with its abundant supply of fragrant flowers, including peonies, rose, jasmine, and lavender. At $99, they’re steeper than your average perfume from the likes of Zara or \u0026 Other Stories — but there’s a reason for that. All four fragrances contain 20% perfume oil, the highest end of the spectrum for eaux de parfum (most hover between a 7% to 15% concentration). This higher concentration guarantees much better staying power, so you’re certainly getting your money’s worth. What’s more, the collection is housed in tall, sculptural bottles that whisper good taste. Ahead, two fragrance-obsessed Refinery29 editors spritzed their way through the buzzy collection. Keep reading for our honest thoughts and which scents we’re most keen to add to our daily rotation. DashDividers_1_500x100 COS Perfumery Auburn Eau de Parfum, $99 “If you’re into gourmand perfumes with sweet, edible notes like vanilla, you’ll love this. Although the brand describes it as a woody scent, I’d argue otherwise. It leans rich rather than clean, with bold hits of coffee, peppery resin, and aromatic clove that easily overpower the sandalwood. That’s no bad thing — quite the opposite. It’s warm, enveloping, and conjures the image of someone swathed in vintage fur coats. As it dries down, the sweetness fades and a hint of tobacco comes through, giving it a more grown-up edge, like stepping into a smoky whiskey bar. Of all the scents, Auburn has the most staying power. I sprayed it on my jacket days ago, and it’s still lingering on the sleeves.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director Shop COS DashDividers_1_500x100 COS Perfumery Fleuriste Eau de Parfum, $99 “I caught a whiff of Fleuriste at a press preview event and couldn’t wait to get my hands on it. Master perfumer Nathalie Lorson likened it to ‘walking into a florist, where floral bouquets intertwine with the air’, and it’s absolutely spot on. A bundle of magnolia, rose, and peonies immediately hits the nose, but thanks to refreshing pink pepper, bergamot, and mandarin in the top notes, there’s an element of dewiness that reminds me more of freshly cut blooms rather than a stuffy floral perfume. Sandalwood and musk form the grounding base, resembling the stems and leaves of a plant. This is one of the most interesting interpretations of fresh flowers in perfumery, and the impressive longevity really adds to the appeal.” — Venus Wong, senior writer Shop COS DashDividers_1_500x100 COS Perfumery Solaire Eau de Parfum, $99 “I have to admit, Solaire is my least favorite of the collection — but it’s still a beautiful scent, which says a lot about how luxurious this range is. Though black pepper and incense are the headline notes, it leans more floral to my nose, thanks to styrax, a heady white flower. It smells clean and airy, like diving into a pile of fresh laundry or using an expensive hand wash in a members-only New York hotel. The musk adds a soft, skin-like warmth that feels like a deep, comforting hug. I prefer this layered with Fleuriste, which is my top pick, but at $99 each, I’d think twice about buying both. The price feels steep for a clothing brand, especially when Zara and \u0026 Other Stories offer perfumes that are just as good.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director Shop COS DashDividers_1_500x100 COS Perfumery Mythe Eau de Parfum, $99 “I’m not a big fan of earthy perfumes, but smelling Mythe on my wrists has made me question my longstanding belief. It’s nothing like the overpowering, musty scent you typically associate with the genre. The vetiver note does make a deep, root-like first impression, but invigorating ginger and leafy cardamom immediately add a fresh and mysterious edge. As Mythe settles on the skin, it transforms into a soft tree bark-like finish, thanks to violet and amyris (a woody note derived from incense). To my nose, this smells like clean, freshly showered skin. I’ve been spending a lot of time in hot and humid places recently, and I’ve been spritzing this on repeat as it’s one of the very few smells I can handle in the heat. It layers beautifully with Fleuriste.” — Venus Wong, senior writer Shop COS This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-inkey-list-exosome-glow-complex-serum-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "It’s rare for beauty editors to get so excited about a product that it dominates our conversations for weeks, but that’s exactly what happens when something truly special cuts through the many samples we receive. More often than not, the products generating the most buzz aren’t backed by celebrities or sold at eye-watering prices. Case in point: The Inkey List’s Exosome Hydro Glow Complex, $22. If exosomes ring a bell, you’ve probably heard about them from a dermatologist, esthetician, or facialist. That’s because this special skincare ingredient is typically reserved for luxury facials and high-end treatments, often touted as a “miracle” for plumping, repairing, and rejuvenating the skin. In New York, for example, a facial containing exosomes can cost upwards of $500. That’s what makes The Inkey List’s new serum seriously special. It contains three million plant-derived exosomes, clinically proven to boost collagen, the protein that gives skin its strength and suppleness, by an impressive 300%. Better still, it’s a snip of the price at $22. But what exactly are exosomes? And why are skincare enthusiasts, experts, and editors so obsessed with them? What are exosomes, and what are the skin benefits? Dr. Anjali Mahto, a consultant dermatologist and founder of Self London, explains that exosomes are naturally produced by our cells and act as messengers, transferring strengthening proteins, moisturizing lipids and genetic material between them: “In skincare, they are believed to promote skin regeneration, reduce inflammation, and support collagen and elastin production,” says Dr. Mahto — two key components that help maintain skin’s firmness and elasticity.  Exosomes can be sourced from both humans and animals, but their safety remains uncertain, and none are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As a result, most exosome-based skincare products use plant-derived exosomes. In The Inkey List’s clinically tested serum, the exosomes come from centella asiatica (also known as cica), making the formula both vegan and cruelty-free. Long used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, cica is a popular skincare ingredient known for calming redness and reducing inflammation. As you might expect, plant-derived exosomes offer a range of skincare advantages: “The potential benefits [of exosomes] include improved skin texture, hydration, and reduced signs of aging,” says Dr. Mahto — think fewer fine lines and wrinkles. While promising, Dr. Mahto notes that research into the long-term effectiveness of exosomes is still evolving. The Inkey List Exosome Hydro-Glow Complex, $22 Besides exosomes, this serum boasts hydrating hyaluronic acid and ectoin, which lock in moisture and support the skin barrier. There’s also Q10, an antioxidant that shields skin against environmental aggressors like dulling pollution, not to mention skin-repairing tripeptide-1. It sounds impressive on paper, but how does it hold up IRL? Firstly, I love the silky texture, which absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling fresh and matte, not sticky. I’ve been using this serum every evening for a month, after cleansing and before moisturizing, and I’ve received countless compliments on my newfound glow.  That’s not all. Last week, I visited Self London for a VISIA skin scan, which assesses the health of your skin in granular detail. The clinician asked if I’d had any recent facials or laser treatments since my skin was impressively plump: “You’ve got great skin structure,” she told me. Besides using an antioxidant serum in the morning and applying a broad-spectrum SPF 50, whether I leave the house or not, I have to assume that this serum is behind my increased collagen and elastin levels. Since using it, I’m also convinced the fine lines under my eyes have softened, as have the two once-prominent frown lines between my eyebrows. Don’t just take my word for it. Head to Sephora and you’ll spot hundreds of reviews, many five-star, highlighting even skin tone and smoother, firmer skin over time. How do exosomes in skincare differ from professional exosome treatments or facials? Who needs expensive treatments when it seems topical exosomes are just as good? Or are they? Dr. Mahto says that topical exosome products may offer some benefits, such as hydration and mild rejuvenation, but their effectiveness is limited by the skin barrier, the outermost layer of skin, which can hinder penetration. “Professional exosome treatments, often delivered via microneedling or injectables, allow deeper delivery directly into the skin, potentially producing more visible results,” says Dr. Mahto. “On the other hand, topical treatments can only go so far.” According to The Inkey List, its cica-derived exosomes are so tiny, not to mention compatible with the skin and its natural processes, that they can “effectively penetrate the surface layers of the skin and act quickly and effectively without microneedling.” Are exosomes unstable as an ingredient? Do they need to be refrigerated or kept at a specific temperature to be effective? But here’s the thing with exosomes: they can be unstable. “They are delicate biological structures sensitive to heat, light, and oxidation,” explains Dr. Mahto, essentially exposure to air. She continues, “To maintain their integrity and efficacy, exosome-containing products often require refrigeration or specific storage conditions.” Dr. Mahto adds that some formulations containing exosomes are freeze-dried to improve stability at room temperature, but this varies by manufacturer. “Without appropriate storage, exosomes may degrade, rendering the product less effective,” she says. With that in mind, I contacted The Inkey List to confirm the best way to store the serum. The brand told me that it doesn’t need refrigeration, but that it should preferably be stored in a cool, dark place, out of direct sunlight. The airtight packaging helps keep the ingredients effective for longer. Some people have reported issues with the pump, but I find it easy to use, as long as I store the serum upright. If exosomes have piqued your interest but the idea of dropping hundreds of dollars on one single treatment makes you squirm, this affordable serum might be your ticket. For even better results, team it with a high-factor, broad-spectrum sunscreen.  This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/megan-fox-castlecore-nails-49442461",
    "description": "Image Source: Getty Images/Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic We'd be lying if we said we've never taken pictures of Megan Fox's nails to the salon and copied her exact manicures. If you're due for a new set soon, you're in luck because Fox just came out of her new baby bliss with nail art that's super trendy and packs a hidden meaning. Inspired by the birth of her and Machine Gun Kelly's new baby girl, Fox's manicure features soft-baby pink colors with 3D details and drawings of little cherubs. The overall style is reminiscent of \"castlecore nails,\" inspired by one of the top trends from the Pinterest Predicts 2025 report. \"Medieval core\" is trending up 110 percent and gothic-inspired beauty looks have followed suit. This, of course, includes nail art. Although Fox's nails have a much softer edge than traditional gothic looks (she swapped in baby angels for chrome crosses, after all), the details on Fox's manicure still adds to the lore. View this post on Instagram A post shared by NAILS OF LA (@nails_of_la) \"We wanted to create a set that felt soft, sacred, and personal,\" says Fox's nail artist Brittney Boyce. \"Megan just had her baby, so we designed these angel baby nails in a delicate pink.\" Boyce says that the angel images used on the nails are decals. \"Traditionally, you'd see this style with gold, but that's not [Fox's] vibe,\" says Boyce. \"Silver chrome felt cooler - more her.\" On the fingers where pictures of angels weren't used, the due opted for a french tip. Boyce has been working with Fox for years now, and even collaborated with her on her pregnancy announcement nails, so the moment is full circle. For that occasion, Fox's nails were gunmetal chrome mixed with black details, which complemented the theme of her oil-slick baby bump photoshoot. If you want to recreate the look at home, we found some angel decals that look very similar. You can grab an Angel Nail Sticker Set ($7) or these StickerRay Little Angel Nail Art Stickers ($4) from Etsy. The castlecore nail trend can be worn by anyone who wants to bring the whimsical fairytale vibes to their fingertips. Brittany Leitner (she/her) is a New York-based contributing beauty writer at PS.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/starface-moisturizer-face-wash-review-49442586",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes As someone who spends a lot of time outdoors (mostly because I can't stand being cooped up inside), skincare is always top of mind. Between SPF, moisturizers, retinols for fine lines, vitamin C serums to tackle sunspots, and pimple patches for that time of the month, I've got a routine for just about everything. After training for a marathon through the depths of a Boston winter, I really started to notice just how much my skin changes with the seasons. (Read: it gets seriously dry.) That's when I leaned into my beloved Weleda Skin Food - thick, rich, and endlessly hydrating. But come summer, I need something lighter that won't feel heavy in the heat. So when I saw that Starface - yes, the viral brand behind those cute star-shaped pimple patches you've definitely seen on TikTok - launched a face wash and moisturizer at an affordable price, I was intrigued. I already use and love the patches, and while the branding is fun, I couldn't help but wonder: does the skincare actually deliver? Spoiler alert: I was pleasantly surprised. Keep reading for my honest review of the Starface Sal Acid Skincare Duo ($27, originally $32) - and why I'll be reaching for it all summer long. About Starface's Sal Acid Skincare Duo The duo includes a face wash and moisturizer designed for daily use, both morning and night. It's formulated for acne-prone skin but is gentle enough to work for dry skin types as well. Key ingredients include salicylic acid to target breakouts, hyaluronic acid for hydration, and glycerin to help soothe and strengthen the skin barrier. You can purchase the products as a duo or buy them separately. What I Like About Starface's Sal Acid Skincare Duo While my face gets dry in the winter, it leans oily in the summer. And not in a cute, dewy way - but in a greasy, breakout-causing kind of way. This means I'm often carrying compact powder around town and reaching for the viral pimple patches whenever a breakout pops up. I knew I needed a lightweight moisturizer that wouldn't add to the oils my face already produces come spring, but also one that could help battle acne. So, when I saw Starface's new Sal Acid Skincare Duo, I was intrigued, considering how well their pimple patches work. The ingredients in both the moisturizer and face wash - salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide - are all skincare heavyweights that work together to help unclog pores, hydrate the skin, and improve texture. And sure enough, they delivered on all fronts. After using this duo for a little over a month, and as warm weather started to roll in, I noticed my skin was less prone to breakouts and stayed plump and bouncy without looking oily. It was hydrated from within, which I'm giving credit to the hyaluronic acid for. While I still experienced a few breakouts around that time of the month, they didn't feel as disruptive. Even with a breakout or two, my skin stayed even-toned and hydrated (rather than looking discolored or dull). How to Use Starface's Sal Acid Skincare Duo Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes When it comes to my skincare routine, simplicity is key, and the Starface Sal Acid Skincare Duo fits perfectly into that mindset. It's just two products, but they seriously get the job done. I start with a dime-sized amount of the Star Wash and lather it up with water. The cleanser has a light, foamy texture and a subtle shimmer that makes washing your face feel a little more fun (don't worry, the sparkle rinses right off). Once my face is clean and dry, I move on to Star Cream. The brand suggests using two pumps, but I find that one pump gives me the hydration I need without feeling greasy. While Starface recommends using both products twice daily, I've tweaked the routine to fit my skin's needs: I use the moisturizer morning and night but I keep the cleanser for nighttime only. That way, it helps wash off the day without over-drying my skin. Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes What to Consider Before Trying Starface's Sal Acid Skincare Duo Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes If you have sensitive skin, heads up - the salicylic acid in both products might be a little too active at first. It's a gentle exfoliant that helps unclog pores, but like with any active ingredient, it's best to start slow and see how your skin reacts. Also worth noting: while Star Wash is great for clearing out dirt and oil, it's not a makeup remover. So if you're looking for a one-and-done cleanser that also takes off your foundation, you might want to add an oil cleanser or micellar water to your routine. That said, if you're looking for something even gentler in the Starface lineup, I recommend trying the Starface's Hydro-Star Recovery Patches ($13) - they're packed with hyaluronic acid to soothe and calm irritated skin (and they look cute on, too). Where Is Starface's Sal Acid Skincare Duo Available? You can purchase the Starface Sal Acid Skincare Duo from Starface World.
