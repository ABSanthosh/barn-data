    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/polka-dot-nails-manicure-trend?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Every year seems to get better and better when it comes to innovative nail trends, but 2025 has already proven to be something of a standout year for manicure inspiration. While maximalist designs like Amalfi-inspired “Italian summer” nails and 3D beach nails have been taking off for summer, we’ve spotted a simpler take on nail art emerging as one to watch for the season ahead. Enter: polka-dot nails.  Somewhat of a retro print, this summer’s polka-dot manicures balance ‘80s charm with a modern minimalism, taking a simple dot and transforming it into endless creative nail art looks. Whether it’s a monochromatic polka print or a rainbow of mismatched dots, the beauty of polka-dot nails is that they are so versatile. Plus, they pair nicely with basically every other trend out there, from French tips to neon hues. Ahead, find 11 of the very best polka-dot designs dotting our social feeds right now.  Princess Polka View this post on Instagram A post shared by AMIRI | biab nails, bespoke facials, lashes + brows | newcastle (@amiri_studio) Proving that polka dots are the perfect nail art look for minimalists, this manicure created at Amiri nail salon layers monochromatic polka dots over a groomed and glossy princess manicure for an ultra-polished look. Espresso Shots Our collective obsession with Pantone’s color of the year, mocha mousse, is continuing into the summer with Caselyn Grover’s coffee-toned manicure proving it. Try Manucurist’s Green Nail Polish in Clove, $14, to recreate it at home. Rainbow Brite View this post on Instagram A post shared by GetNailed. (@getnailedkelowna) Why pick just one color when you can have, well, 20? This riotously bright nail look by GetNailed salon is essentially a dopamine hit in manicure form. Obsessed. Chestnut Tips View this post on Instagram A post shared by GIA ARTISTRY | Sydney Gel Artist 🍒 (@gia.artiistry) If you don’t fancy an all-over print, then polka-dot French tips are proving popular right now. This look by Gia Artistry uses a warm chestnut brown tone with bright white microdots for a wearable everyday manicure.  True Blue View this post on Instagram A post shared by Melanie Graves (@overglowedit) Mismatched polka-dot manicures are a huge trend, but if you prefer something a little more subtle, then opt for two tonal colors rather than a clash, much like this blue look by nail content creator Melanie Graves. Try OPI Shore Is Something!, $12.99, with Essie Gel Couture in Caviar Bar, $13. ‘80s Excess View this post on Instagram A post shared by HATTONNAILS (@elisahatton) An homage to the more-is-more aesthetic of the ‘80s, where polka-dot power two-pieces once reigned supreme, this jewelry manicure by Hattonnails embraces opulence in the best way. Quiet luxury? We don’t know her. Milky Sorbet View this post on Instagram A post shared by Emma Maughan (@___embeauty) Sorbet shades are big news for summer 2025, so we expect to see more gelato-toned polka dots like this one by nail artist Emma Maughan. Dotted Borders View this post on Instagram A post shared by @beautybyabigailjessica Rather than going for all-over print, nail tech @beautybyabigailjessica has created a fun polka-dot-bordered manicure to frame some cute floral nail art. A fun and unexpected way to wear spots. Mix \u0026 Match View this post on Instagram A post shared by VIBE • NEWCASTLE, NSW (@vibe_nailartistry) The eclectic mix of French tips, negative space and pops of red makes this striking set created at Newcastle’s Vibe nail salon the ultimate cool-girl polka-dot manicure. Jelly Dots View this post on Instagram A post shared by Shannon Elias (@elias.nails) Between soap nails and juicy nail tints, it’s clear that sheer and dewy manicures have dominated this year. So it makes perfect sense for nail artist Shannon Elias to opt for a pink jelly base for this microscopic polka-dot design. Essie Jelly Gloss in Blush Jelly, $13, makes the perfect at-home color for this look. Dalmatian Spots View this post on Instagram A post shared by SYDNEY’S #1 NAIL \u0026 BEAUTY SALON ♡ (@acenails_andbeauty) Like Cruella de Vil in manicure form, this stiletto-shaped nail look by Ace Nails and Beauty is seriously glamorous.  This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK.

    "description": "To paraphrase Lana Del Rey, there’s something special about hot summer nights in July. Whether it’s sipping a spritz on a sunny balcony with friends or reading in the park after a day at work, the warm nights are here — and we’re cherishing every single one.The most glamorous place to be enjoying the sun, though, has been Men’s Paris Fashion Week, with hordes of celebrities flocking to the European capital for a slice of summer style inspo. From Jacquemus showing its Spring/Summer 2026 collection in L’Orangerie at the Château de Versailles to Dior borrowing paintings from the Louvre for an art museum-inspired extravaganza for Jonathan Anderson's creative director debut, the shows have been attended by some of the industry’s most famous faces.For the latter, the guest list included fashion It couple ASAP Rocky and Rihanna, with the pregnant A-lister styling a mint waistcoat and classic white shirt with pearls, yellow-lensed sunglasses, and a wavy updo. Sabrina Carpenter was also in attendance, opting for a preppy skirt suit set and a side-swept fringe complete with a statement barrette.  But it was perhaps Pharrell’s Louis Vuitton show that caused the biggest stir on the internet, when Beyoncé arrived in a full Cowboy Carter-inspired double denim outfit, accessorized with a big blond blowdry, cowboy hat, Western buckled belt, and feathery brown jacket.While our invites might have been lost in the post, there’s still plenty of serious fashion and beauty moments to get involved with over the coming month. To take a look at all the best launches coming up this July, click through the slideshow ahead. Cecilie Bahnsen x Asics SportStyle Gel-Cumulus ShoeAs part of a new Signature Series, Asics has chosen frequent collaborator Cecilie Bahnsen as the first designer to reinterpret an iconic silhouette from the sportswear brand. Known for her hyper-feminine puff-sleeved dresses and full skirts, the collaboration sees the Danish designer add her ethereal touch to the Gel-Cumulus 16 SSCB sneaker. Available in three colorways (black, gray, and butter yellow), the design combines transparent materials, floral prints, and a flower lace toggle.Available to shop at Cecilie BahnsenCecilie Bahnsen x ASICS GEL-CUMULUS 16 SSCB SNEAKERS, $, available at Cecilie BahnsenPrada Balm in Banana YellowInspired by the banana print in Prada's Spring/Summer 2011 collection, the fashion house is now bringing the sunshine yellow motif into its beauty lineup. Teased in Sabrina Carpenter's \"Manchild\" music video, the bright yellow bullet offers a sheer but sunny look, with the golden flecks effortlessly creating a juicy finish on lips or dewy cheeks depending on where you apply it. Enriched with moisturizing jojoba oil and infused with a sweet banana scent, this balm is about to be the coveted handbag staple of the summer. Available on July 8th at PradaLevi’s Brand x NikeThis summer, Levi’s and Nike are joining forces to make the shoe of the summer: Air Max 95s in distressed blue denim. Additionally offering the iconic silhouette in ecru and black (complete with red Levi’s label), the collaboration also includes a light-wash trucker jacket and baggy jeans with Nike swoosh embroidery. Plus, the shoes come with red, black, and white laces so you can choose the look that fits best with your aesthetic.Available to shop on July 10 at Levi'sCharlotte Tilbury Unreal Lips Healthy Glow Nectar Oil It’s summer and that means one thing: juicy lips. If you’re searching for a nostalgic hit, look no further than Charlotte Tilbury’s latest offering — a squeezy tube lip gloss. Available in six fruity fragrances from strawberry to coconut water, the lip oils lend a sheer tint and contain skin-boosting ingredients like hydrating hyaluronic acid, moisturizing vitamin E, and antioxidant-rich fruit oils that also give a shiny, hydrated finish to the lips. Our favorite is Juicylicious Cherry Glaze for a subtle just-bitten lip look.Available to shop on July 10 at Charlotte Tilbury Uniqlo Launches Third Studio Ghibli CollaborationBack in 2022, Uniqlo and cinematic powerhouse Studio Ghibli joined forces to create their first collaborative collection. Now, the popular Japanese label is back with a third drop showcasing artwork from some of the studio’s most beloved films. Featuring 14 pieces, the collection includes a T-shirt with leafy bird imagery from The Boy and The Heron, a gray My Neighbour Totoro sweatshirt, and a pink ombre Tale of Princess Kaguya T-shirt. Bonus: The collection has a matching kids collection for those shopping for little ones, too.   Available to shop on July 10 at UniqloCeraVe Balancing Air Foam CleanserFrom the spot-busting SA Smoothing Cleanser to the creamy Hydrating Cleanser, CeraVe’s face washes are affordable and effective. Now, the wallet-friendly brand is launching the Balancing Air Foam Cleanser, which pulls oil, dirt, and impurities out of the skin \"like a magnet.\" Using glycolysine cleansing technology, the foam formula promises 24-hour hydration (thanks to ceramides and allantoin), meaning it won’t strip the skin barrier — all while providing eight-hour oil control. Available to shop now at UltaCeraVe Balancing Air Foam Facial Cleanser, $, available at UltaHuda Beauty Lip Contour StainA well-defined lip is a must and nothing takes the chore out of application like a felt-tip brush. Huda Beauty’s new Lip Contour Stain is easy to use, delivering a long-lasting lip stain that can be worn neatly as a liner, a blurred lip blush, or even as a full matte stain. Available in eight different shades, the product contains moisturizing argan oil and promises 12-hour wear thanks to its highly pigmented formula. Our favorites are Cinnamon, a rosy taupe shade, and Soft Nude for a \"your lips but better\" look. Available to shop now at Huda BeautyHuda Beauty Lip Contour Stain, $, available at Huda BeautyDyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x™ The Dyson Airwrap did to hair tools what TikTok did to the internet: it took over. The latest iteration of the beloved styler is powered by Dyson’s fastest and most powerful motor yet: the Hyperdymium™ 2. Giving users twice the air pressure (helping to wrap hair more easily), the new tool also promises to dry hair as fast as a full-performance hairdryer — but it’s the brand's most lightweight design yet. Even better, there are six attachments for different style options, and each one connects to the MyDyson™ app with the new i.d. Curl™ feature. This helps deliver consistent curls by automatically adjusting heat and airflow. Available to shop on July 8 at DysonAsos x Adidas Capsule - Embargo 3rd JulyBlending bespoke fabrics, embroidery and new colorways, the new Adidas x Asos collaboration puts a streetwear spin on the former’s key archive silhouettes. Comprised of 18 apparel pieces, our favorite from the collection is the cream Firebird track jacket with burgundy piping and floral prints — a perfect layering piece for summer nights in the city.Available to shop July 15 at AsosLike what you see?

    "description": "Like the author Joyce Meyer once said: change your words, change your life. This mantra can also apply to tattoos. Words have the power to transform your perspective, and can often inspire you to do some amazing things, so if you want to give yourself a permanent reminder of your favorite word or phrase, nothing is more impactful than a few quote tattoos. The best (and perhaps most overwhelming) part about this type of ink is that the options for tattoo quotes are essentially endless. Whether you want to find inspirational tattoo quotes about strength, self-love, relationships, or permanently etch a line from your favorite movie, song lyric, or poem onto your skin - the sky is the limit with what you can get. Even when you're feeling philosophical, guess what? There are quote tattoo ideas that can help you capture all those existential thoughts you're having. Regardless of whether you want something small and sentimental or a piece of ink that is going to make you and others think, quote tattoos about life can help capture a sentiment perfectly. Regardless if you like big or small designs, meaningful tattoo quotes can be placed anywhere on your body, depending on if you want to keep the design hidden or if you want the phrase out in the open as a daily reminder for yourself whenever you look at it. Either way, if you're looking for body art that represents you, we've rounded up some of the most beautiful and motivational quote tattoo ideas that will change your point of view for the better. Good tattoo phrases are everywhere, you just have to know where to look. From tattoo quotes about strength to small quote tattoos, we've rounded up the best tattoo quotes, which feature a little something for everyone. Keep scrolling to see them all.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/helena-love-island-personal-essay-49450015",
    "description": "\"'Love Island UK' Star Helena Ford Looks Dramatically Different in Old Photos.\" \"Helena Ford From 'Love Island' Looks Unrecognizable in Throwback Pictures.\" \"Unearthed Throwback Pics Show an Unrecognizable Helena Ford.\" These are just some of the headlines I've seen popping up on my social media feeds over the last few days. TLDR, if you couldn't tell, apparently old photos of \"Love Island\"'s Helena Ford have popped up online, and surprise! She looks dramatically different. And guess what else? I'm over it. Not only do I not care if 29 year-old Helena Ford looks completely different from 'unearthed' photos (this is reality television, btw, not an archeological dig), but I truly don't think it's any of my business. Why? Because what people choose to do to their bodies is up to them. Does Ford look different in the photos? Sure, her hair color is different, her face is a bit rounder, and her lips look smaller, but guess who also looks a lot freaking different than they did two years ago, five years ago, and ten years ago? Me. And honestly, probably, you, too. \"We're allowed to evolve, to make changes, to look different. We're allowed to look worse, and we're sure as hell allowed to look better.\" Yes, celebrities have been getting more open when it comes to the plastic surgery they've had done, but honestly, whether it's puberty, filler, Botox or a full blown face lift, does it really matter? We already pit women against each other, do we really need to start pitting women against their younger selves? Let's get one thing clear: faces change. It's kind of what they do. I'm 35 now, and I sure as hell do not look the same way I looked when I was 25. (Thankfully I look much, much better.) I have a fridge covered in what the internet would undoubtedly dub \"throwback photos,\" and I remember my boyfriend looking at them a year or so ago and asking me if I had had a nose job. First of all, to be clear - there's nothing I would love more than a nose job (and a breast lift, and a blepharoplasty), but second, nope, never had one. His question was also posed pre-Botox and pre my one harrowing experience with filler, so he was straight up just comparing my natural ass face to my natural ass younger face. And if Ford did get a bunch of filler, a nose job, or even a full face transplant, is it really my business? Nope. Not unless she personally calls me up and decides to tell me about it, or if she publicly decides to comment on it and bring others into the conversation. The internet is acting like Ford, and women in general, are hiding something when WE don't share personal details about the work or treatments we've had done, but let me say it again, a little louder for the people in the back: it's no one's business. How someone looked in the past isn't \"evidence\" of anything. We don't need to investigate it like it is. All this to say: let Ford live her life. We're allowed to evolve, to make changes, to look different. We're allowed to look worse, and we're sure as hell allowed to look better. It doesn't matter whether it's due to a ChatGPT outlined glow up, age, or 18 pounds of filler to the face. Maybe we should all be a little less concerned with what women are doing with their bodies, and a little more concerned with why some people feel the need to comment on it.
