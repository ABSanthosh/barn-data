Save for a brief-ish stint as a blonde, Lindsay Lohan’s iconic red hair has helped make some of the most iconic looks in millennial film history. Mean Girls wouldn’t be the same if Cady Heron sported buttery blonde hair à la Regina George, just as Lola’s born-to-stand-out personality in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen was perfectly expressed with her highlighted strawberry blonde strands. In our current social media-fueled age, it’s tempting to try every new hair color or cut t that floods your FYP. However, if you ever needed a strong case for a signature look, I’d argue that Lohan’s iconic mane is as rock-solid evidence as any — and it’s why Nexxus decided to partner with the actor on its latest campaign. “Hair is everything when it comes to building a character or making a statement on the red carpet,” Lohan tells Refinery29. “Whether it’s a sleek style that shows confidence or soft waves that give a more laid-back vibe, hair always helps set the tone. I love working closely with my stylist, Danielle Priano, to experiment and play around.” Nexxus is known for its affordable, salon-quality hair products, and the brand’s new Style Swap campaign proves that you don’t need an A-list budget to achieve some of the trendiest looks right at home. In addition to spotlighting Nexxus’ versatile styling products, the campaign also gave Lohan a chance to revisit two of her most beloved roles to date: Annie and Hallie from 1998’s The Parent Trap. “It felt like stepping back into those characters but with a more modern twist — kind of like catching up with old friends,” she says. For any Meredith Blake truthers, there’s also a cheeky nod to one conniving blonde fiancée: “And yes, that wide-brim hat was definitely a little wink to Meredith Blake! We couldn’t leave her out — she’s just too iconic not to get her own moment.” I don’t disagree! Some of Lohan’s favorites include Nexxus’ Repair \u0026 Nourish Ultra Lightweight Hair Oil (“It adds shine without weighing my hair down, which is so important,” she says), in addition to the brand’s Slick Stick, an innovative solid wax that makes crafting sleek styles a breeze. Best of all, these products clock in at $20 and under — a steal compared to luxury brands. “My hair goes through a lot, whether I’m on set or getting ready for an event, so keeping it healthy is always a top priority,” Lohan adds. “The built-in heat protectants in Nexxus styling products are a total lifesaver, but I still try to be mindful of heat styling and make sure my natural color gets plenty of hydration.” With Lohan starring in another Netflix Christmas movie this holiday season (Our Little Secret),  I am very here for Lohan’s return as rom-com royalty — especially if it means more major hair moments gracing our screens. “Working with Nexxus has been such a fun experience because they really understand the power of hair to transform a look and a mood,” says Lohan. “Being able to play with different styles that tap into some of my most iconic characters while using products I truly love makes this campaign so special.” Like what you see?

    "description": "Between glass nails, the invisible French manicure and a rainbow of trending nail colors, there has been no shortage of manicure inspiration in 2024. One of the most enduring trends of the year has to be the chrome manicure. With their distinctive high-shine finish and metallic edge, chrome nails are undeniably cool — and surprisingly versatile. The glossy texture works well with pretty much every color you can think of and looks just as impactful as a block-color manicure as it does a nail art accent.“Chrome nails are best achieved in salon for a really flawless finish,” explains pro nail artist and educator Jessica White. “You start with a base color, followed by a gel color and top coat, then layer a chrome powder over the top to get that rich, reflective look,” she says. Although it can be tricky to replicate the look (traditional polish doesn’t hold chrome powder as well as gel), White recommends OPI Glazed N’ Amused Nail Lacquer, for recreating a “soft iridescent chrome effect” at home. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Melanie Graves (@overglowedit) Whether you head to the salon or attempt it at home, read on for 12 of the best chrome manicure ideas to inspire you. DashDividers_1_500x100 Copper Glow View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nicola Jones | Nail Technician (@nicolarose_beauty) Perfect for the autumn and winter months, this expensive-looking copper chrome manicure by Nicola Jones would work just as well paired with casual, cosy knits as it would any festive party outfit. Recreate a similar finish at home with Essie Nail Lacquer in Penny Talk. Mermaid Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by Vettsy (@vettsystore) Providing the perfect antidote to winter’s shorter days and darker nights, this ethereal blend of pastel hues created by Polished by Bec is a manicure designed to make a splash. Silver Tips View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jessica White (@jessicawhitenailartist) Taking a classic French manicure and adding a modern twist, Jessica White’s silver chrome-tipped nail look is perfect for party season. Get the look yourself with Nails.Inc Mirror Chrome Nail Polish in Silver Served. Burnt Orange Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by Noemy Soto (@art.by.noemy) Halloween might be over but we have no doubt that burnt orange nails are here to stay. Noemy Soto’s combination of the deep pumpkin shade paired with the reflective chrome finish is a tonal delight. Chocolate Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by Myprettyset (@myprettyset) Brown manicures emerge as a trend every autumn and White predicts that this deep chocolate shade, which Destiny Medina has used for this molten nail art look, is going to be everywhere. “Chocolate chrome adds a unique warmth and richness that is perfect for autumn,” says White. Try The GelBottle Chrome Pigment in Brownie, for the same rich finish. Vanilla Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by Aimee L Link (@allnailss._) Cast your mind back to last summer and vanilla chrome nails were everywhere — in large part because of how good this Alexandra Teleki manicure looked. It has since inspired countless iterations including this short set by nail artist Aimee L Link. The soft, creamy color is clean, minimalist and perfect for a more pared-back take on the chrome trend. Deep Blue Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by JENNA KELLY | Utah Nail Artist (@nails_by_jenna.k) White predicts that chrome nails will talk a walk on the dark side this winter. “For the coming season, I think that darker, moodier chrome manicures will be big. Think deep charcoals, rich wines and navy,” says White. This royal blue manicure by Jenna Kelly is first on our list to try. Moonlit Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by nails by skye (@nailsthatlooklikepaintings) Characterized by their silvery, pearlescent shimmer, moonlight chrome nails are set to dominate this winter. Skye’s stunning take on the trend using chrome and foil is out of this world. Cherry Red Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by Iram Shelton (@iramshelton) Red nails feel undoubtedly festive but look great year-round, too. Take inspiration from this set by nail artist Iram Shelton. If all-over color feels too bold for you then why not make like TJ and go for deep red chrome tips? Purple Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by Beauty By Hollie (@beauty_byhollie_) Forget the lilacs and lavenders of summer; purple nails are getting a grungy makeover for autumn and winter. Shades of aubergine, plum and mulberry work particularly well in chrome as Hollie’s metallic manicure proves. OPI Nail Lacquer in Abstract After Dark, has all the shimmer and shine of a chrome gel manicure but in an at-home formula. Nude Tint Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by NAILS OF LA (@nails_of_la) “Right now, I’m loving a classic nude base topped with chrome — it’s such a timeless, chic look that complements any style,” says White. This neutral chrome manicure paired with delicate metallic detailing from Nails of LA is such a fun and wearable take on the trend. Graphite Shine View this post on Instagram A post shared by Iram Shelton (@iramshelton) Silver, charcoal and grey always work well during the cooler months. Iram Shelton’s graphite chrome manicure takes the color all over the nails for an almost industrial, disco ball effect. Recreate the look at home with OPI Infinite Shine Gel-Like Lacquer in It’s the Shiz. Like what you see?

    "title": "TikTok's Viral Hair Plopping Hack Has Changed My Routine",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/hair-plopping-editor-experiment-48672760",
    "description": "Contrary to what my husband thinks of TikTok, I've actually learned a lot on the video-sharing app. I've discovered how to apply concealer to lift my face, an at-home tanning kit that lets me fake a spray tan without leaving my bathroom, and how to plop my hair. Prior to discovering TikTok videos on how to properly dry my hair, I thought only my sister was blessed with my mom's curly hair and that I was destined to have somewhat lifeless, limp ends that sometimes looked wavy and sometimes not, depending on the day. It wasn't until videos of people plopping appeared on my FYP that I said to myself, \"Wait . . . I think I've been doing this all wrong.\" Before we jump into my life-changing hair revelation, let's make one thing clear: my hair is more wavy than it is curly - I'm probably around a 2B or 2C curl type on the hair-type scale. That said, I was still not doing my hair any favors with my old drying routine, and once I started plopping, I was able to get much better definition in my waves. Now, let's get one thing straight: no one on TikTok invented plopping. It's been around for quite some time - that's just how I discovered it. What I learned from the rabbit hole of hair-plopping videos that I went down was that my errors began immediately after I got out of the shower. After toweling off, I used to run a brush through my hair to remove any knots (mistake number one) before throwing my hair up into a microfiber towel (mistake number two) and letting it get about 70 percent dry with the towel on (mistake number three). The right way to dry wavy or curly hair is actually to brush it in the shower while it's soaking wet. Next, and possibly most importantly, you want to apply your hair products to your sopping-wet hair. Because curly hair types crave a lot of moisture, this is the best time to deliver your leave-in conditioners and styling products. I applied the Ceremonia Guava Leave-In Conditioner ($27) followed by The Inkey List Chia Seed Curl Defining Hair Cream ($11) using a scrunching method instead of combing my fingers through my hair to help the waves form. This is also arguably the worst part - something about having to stand there with drenched hair, water running down your back while you apply products, is just not my favorite thing in the world. Nevertheless, I committed. Then, only after your hair is covered in product, is it time to put it up to dry. You can use a microfiber towel if you want or go the classic plopping route, which involves a cotton T-shirt. (I alternate between the two depending on how lazy I'm feeling that day). For this experiment, I used a shirt. The key is to gather all of your hair at the crown of your head and gently wrap the T-shirt around your head. I let it dry like that for about 10 minutes. When I take off the T-shirt, my hair is usually about 60 percent dry. The next step is also a bit of a challenge, but as my sister so plainly told me: don't touch it. The more you mess with it while it finishes drying, the frizzier it will get. I like to use a product similar to the the Kristen Ess Setting Clips ($10) to keep it off of my face while it air-drys so I'm less likely to touch it. This final step of air-drying takes a few hours for me, but everyone's hair is different. If I'm short on time, I'll diffuse my hair to speed up the process. All in all, plopping your hair isn't hard, but it does involve a few steps, and depending on what your current hair-care routine is, it may seem a little overwhelming at first. There are still days when I feel too lazy to plop and I just let my hair do its thing (but on those days, I know it's not going to have as much volume). Considering all it takes are an old T-shirt and some curly-hair products, I say give it a try.
