    "description": "Finding a company that matches your values in this divisive social climate can be like trying to find an adequate pair of jeans when you’re in between sizes. There may be a few brands that almost deliver on the promise of a perfect fit, but with every pair you pull on, something isn’t quite right. Oh, and they’re all made in sweat shops. Yes, it’s usually naive at best and futile at worst to put your faith in a for-profit corporation to provide good products and be good. But for 30 years, Lush has done both. Led by co-founder Rowena Bird, Lush Cosmetics has been committed to protecting people, animals, and the planet and they’ve put their money where their morals are. Recently, they threw a Resist Ball (hosted by trans activist Dylan Mulvaney) to honor a big milestone: donating 100 million dollars to grassroots organizations. Long before the Resist Ball, Bird and the beauty company have been at the forefront of combining commerce with furthering good causes. They were vegetarian before it was trendy and sustainable before it was expected. “It’s always been in the whole ecosystem [of the company]. It’s in the bones of us, as opposed to saying, ‘hey we’ll start a company, and what do people want to see? Let’s do that’,” Bird tells me over lunch at Cafe Cluny in New York City the day before the Resist Ball. She knows about the stat that 82% of Gen Z say they are more likely to purchase from brands that advocate for social equality, but that’s not her motivation. “It’s always been, ‘no, this is how we are, and whether it’s fashionable or not, this is how we’re going to be, and this is what we’re going to do.’” That commitment is clear in their partnership with Mulvaney, a comedian, activist and bestselling author who used to work at Lush when she was 16 years old growing up in San Diego. “I think if you had told me then that I would be hosting the Lush Resist Ball in New York City, I would have probably passed out on top of the gorgeously curated bath bomb display I had just made,” Mulvaney said to laughs as she emceed the Resist Ball. Before the big event, Refinery29 was there as Mulvaney was getting ready — glam and all — and she spoke more of what the partnership means to her.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Refinery29 (@refinery29) “Lush was one of the only places I felt safe as a queer kid,” Mulvaney said in a pink Marchesa gown. “All the women and queer people who worked there made me feel like I could be myself.” Her collaboration, the “Late Bloomer” bath bomb, has already garnered over $30,000 for trans-led organizations. As an outsider looking in at Mulvaney’s partnership with the brand, it’s a beautiful testament to the longevity of Lush’s progressive spirit. The brand created a safe space for Mulvaney when she was a vulnerable teen, and now she’s blossomed into an essential voice in the trans community and a beacon of hope on our depressing timelines.  Lush was one of the only places I felt safe as a queer kid.dylan mulvaney When I ask Bird what it means to her that Mulvaney found solace in her stores, she gives an answer, like so many times throughout our lunch, that is oozing with humility and empathy. “It makes me sad because that’s the only place [where she felt included] but I’m pleased that there is somewhere. One of our taglines is ‘All are welcome always.’ Everywhere should be. But if we can create a safe place for people to hopefully see or feel things in there, it makes me feel good,” Bird says. “It’s a really great, authentic story, given that she actually worked at Lush. She truly is a fan of the brand and uses many of our products.”  Unlike Mulvaney, I hadn’t used Lush products in years. I remember picking up bath bombs when I was in high school working at my local mall in Oakville, Ontario, and Lush was the store we gravitated to because of its distinct aroma and inviting displays. So when I showed up to my hotel room and it was packed with Lush products, I knew I had to try them all. From the “dream cream” body lotion to the “ultrabland” facial cleanser and the “brazziliant” body butter, my skin hadn’t smelled — or felt — better. And it helps knowing that all the packaging is recyclable and the products are made with cruelty-free and vegan or vegetarian ingredients.  When Bird talks about how the brand chooses their ingredients (like sourcing Tagua nuts in Ecuador for their scrubs), she lights up. And when she details how Lush vets which grassroots organizations to give to, she’s even more passionate. “We have an in-house team that’s dedicated to vetting those organizations and ensuring that the money is going to go to places where it’s going to make the biggest impact.” The 100 million dollars that has been donated over the last 30 years has all been distributed amongst 19,000 different ones. Lush actually employs an ethics director (Hilary Jones, a former activist and campaigner), which is not something all beauty brands can say. And what does Bird say to the critics who think Lush should stay in its lane and be less outspoken? “It’s important,” she says plainly. “I think it matters who says it, as long as it’s genuine, as long as it’s the truth, as long as it’s not greenwashing information to tell you what is going on and what governments don’t want you to know that you really should know. If there’s something that you can do about it, do it. If a million people make that one small change, it’s actually a big change. And we’ve got all our windows and billboards to the world to be able to pass those messages on, and then a customer or person walking past can think, ‘Do I want to know more about that?’” We’ve got all our windows and billboards to the world to be able to pass messages on, and then a customer or person walking past can think, ‘Do I want to know more about that?’”rowena bird, lush co-founder “Everyone’s job is to highlight things that are not right so that people can make their own decisions. We have the luxury of all these shop windows where we can do it, so we’re gonna do it,” Bird says, referring to a recent campaign where they renamed three bath bombs to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Since Trump’s inauguration, many brands have cowered to the U.S. president’s demands to roll back DEI initiatives. Lush not only remains committed to their plan, they’re also very publicly and unequivocally condemning the far right’s war on progress. In a time when so many other beauty brands have abandoned their moral compasses, Lush’s has never been more centered.  Lush’s continued commitment to DEI was on full display when I got to experience the Lush Spa on Lexington Avenue. The staff looked as eclectic as the streets of New York City, and my spa treatment was led by a warm and welcoming Black woman named Solange. Rest is an essential part of any resistance so before the Resist Ball, I got the Wicked-themed book-a-bath experience (which I swore the team curated specifically for me, a noted Wicked stan, but the activation has been available for months) which was an unforgettable, 30-minute immersive bathing session that transports you into the magical world of Oz. While enveloped in a cozy, green-and-gold room adorned with taper candles and Oz-themed wallpaper (as you soak, instrumental versions of songs from the Wicked soundtrack play) and enjoying my “Pink Fizzes Good With Green” bath bomb and limited edition “Emerald City Soap,” I thought about how rare and frankly radical it is to encounter a successful business that delivers such care and intention in the products and experiences they deliver and in the causes they support. In the past year, it would be easy to start to believe that these things can’t coexist; that you have to choose between your morals and making money, between value and your values. Sure, I was on a curated brand trip, but Lush is who they say they are, and learning that truth was as refreshing as taking a bath in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday.  On the night of the Resist Ball, Lush continued to prove that its charitable commitments aren’t just lip service. Partygoers were treated to the sounds of the Resistance Revival Chorus (with one singer donning a keffiyah scarf), Mulvaney’s energetic hosting style, and a conversation moderated by Carleen Pickard, the advocacy and activism manager for Lush North America. The panelists included Danielle Silber, the director of corporate engagement for the ACLU, Damario Solomon-Simmons, national civil rights attorney and founder of Justice for Greenwood (a foundation fighting for justice, restoration \u0026 reparations for the survivors and descendants of the victims of the Tulsa Massacre), and Manuel Oliver, gun violence activist, co-founder of Change the Ref (working to vote out politicians who take NRA money and vote in politicians with gun-safety agendas), and father of Parkland shooting victim, Jaoquin Oliver. This wasn’t your average panel at a beauty event. Things like reparations, gun violence, and fighting against unlawful deportations are topics people tell you to avoid at dinner parties. For Lush, they are issues in desperate need of platforming. While the panel just scratched the surface of each issue, the conversation went deep and the room was left in awe of each activist and their imperative work.  By the time Rowena Bird took the stage to thank the crowd, there had been big laughs, a few tears, and a space created that prioritized resistance and joy (the motto “joy is an act of resistance” was projected on a giant screen throughout the night).  When she was 16, Mulvaney found a safe space in Lush. A decade later, while she’s no stranger to people attacking her joy and her very existence, she stood up in a space that met her with applause and excitement. Mulvaney is someone who lives authentically in the face of bigotry and stands in her truth, in spite of an onslaught of hate. Now, she’s found a partnership that matches that energy. You could say it’s the perfect fit. The Resist Ball, and Lush’s 30 years of service, was a reminder that companies can stand up for what’s right, even when it’s not popular and amid pressure to stay silent, you can thrive without compromising your values, and that giving back is always good for business. In this climate, it’s the reminder we all needed.  Like what you see?

    "description": "While nail trends come and go, certain manicures never look dated — and the French manicure is one of them. Classic, minimal, and undeniably timeless, there’s nothing like that combination of white tips and a nude base for an instantly polished nail look. However, if you love a pared-back manicure but find the humble French mani slightly, well, basic, then you might be interested in its latest iteration. Enter: the tinted French manicure. Also known as the “French glow”, this trending manicure features all the trademarks of a classic French (polished tips and a neutral base) but with an extra dose of shine. Celebrity nail technician Harriet Westmoreland has made the look something of a trademark this year with her “pink glow Frenchie” being shared all over social media — and prompting plenty of people to take on the trend themselves. Think soap nails meets French tips; it’s a clean and juicy nail look that’s perfect for summer. Trust me when I say that you’re about to see the tinted French manicure everywhere.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Harriet Westmoreland (@harrietwestmoreland) What is the tinted French manicure? At first glance, the tinted French or “French glow” manicure looks incredibly similar to its classic predecessor. But the focus here is on the shine, which adds an almost jelly-like glow to the nails. “The French glow is designed to enhance your natural nail color, lend a super glossy effect, and create the illusion of perfected nails finished with a French tip,” explains session manicurist Ami Streets. While similar to the natural nail tints that have been popular over the last year, Streets points out that the tinted French differs slightly: “It mimics a refined French look, whereas nail tints provide just a delicate hint of color,” says Streets. Another key factor that sets the tinted French apart from the original is the tip. Rather than a stark white tip, many nail artists are opting for more sheer, milky whites that give the tinted French a softer and more contemporary-looking result. As for the base color? “Use a sheer, milky, or pink-toned polish to create a soft, healthy glow and a ‘your nails but better’ finish,” says Streets. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Shauna (@nailsdonewright) How do you achieve the tinted French manicure at home? While a visit to the nail salon is always a joy, Streets says the tinted French manicure is easy to DIY at home: “It’s a quick way to get nails looking chic and groomed with few products,” Streets says. She adds that you can recreate this trend by using a nail glow product alone for great results. The Dior Vernis Nail Glow, $32, works by brightening and reviving the natural color of your nails, so both your tips and nail base will look more vibrant and polished after just one coat.  If you have more time, Streets recommends prepping for your manicure. “Ensure the nail surface is clean, shaped, and buffed so that color application will be smooth and even,” she says. Next, apply two thin coats of your chosen nail glow color. We rate Zoya Naked Manicure Perfector, $12, and Londontown Sheer Strength Nail Blush, $20. Then use a fine liner brush to apply the milky tip. Manucurist’s Green Nail Polish in Milky White, $19, is the perfect creamy hue. “Follow the natural shape of your nail tip to create the French tip detail and add a top coat for added resilience,” explains Streets. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Chels Lou (@chelslounails) How long does the tinted French manicure last? Besides being such a versatile nail look, one of the best things about a tinted French manicure is that you won’t have to rush to redo your nails. “It’s the ultimate low-maintenance manicure,” says Streets. “Choosing a natural base color or nail tint is much longer-lasting than brighter or darker hues, as the regrowth is almost imperceptible. Adding a long-wear top coat like Essie Stay Longer Top Coat, $11, also reduces the chances of that carefully applied French tip chipping away. It’s a polished look that sticks around.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/taylor-frankie-paul-secret-lives-mormon-wives-interview-49444201",
    "description": "Image Source: Monica Schipper/Getty Images Taylor Frankie Paul of \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" was 15 years old when she moved to Utah from Colorado and experienced the culture shock of the state's seemingly \"perfect\" beauty standards. But that doesn't mean she didn't fit in instantly. \"The beauty culture here [is about looking] well kept because everyone else is,\" Paul says. \"You feel this obligation.\" Some of the trademarks of \"Mormon Wives\" on Hulu include Botox (season one showed the moms getting laughing gas at their injectable appointments), boob jobs (Paul and a few of her costars have them), spray tans, and, of course, hair extensions to keep their renowned Utah curls looking perfect. But Paul, who began injectables two years ago at age 28, doesn't see herself as a beauty or fashion influencer. \"I'm pretty much the Adam Sandler of the group,\" she says. \"If I could show up in sweats every day, every scene, I would.\" If you've already binged season two, you may have noticed a more relaxed, comfier vibe from Paul all around (save for the Halloween party when she showed up as cat-suit Gretchen Wieners and gave her exes a piece of her mind), but one thing you won't see her with is boring hair. Her secret to her perfect waves? \"Just dirty hair,\" she says. \"I go probably four to five days without washing it.\" Ahead, Paul reveals her beauty essentials for filming, what shocked her most about sharing her story with the world, and the manifestations she has on deck for 2025. Taylor Frankie Paul's Beauty Favorites Paul starts out each shoot day with the MCoBeauty Makeup Grip Primer ($12), and if you think the packaging looks familiar, you're not wrong. \"They do dupes, or dupés is what they call it,\" says Paul of MCo and her partnership with the brand. \"I love that they're affordable and it's the same thing, if not better.\" For extra-long filming days that bleed into the night, she also reaches for the MCoBeauty Miracle Flawless Setting Spray ($12). If Paul is low on time and can only reach for one makeup product before heading out the door, she prioritizes her face base over anything else. She doesn't need to waste time with mascara because she has her lashes done. \"I actually do all my own makeup for all filming, and then I'll get touchups for interview days,\" she says. \"I use the Makeup by Mario Hydrating Foundation [$44] every day.\" When it comes to SPF, Paul actually layers it on top of her foundation, a trick she's picked up to combat the dry air of Utah. She's a fan of Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sunscreen ($15). \"I put it on after makeup, and everything's done and it makes you glow,\" she says. The Most Surprising Thing About Fan Reactions Sure, \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" has the drama, the beauty treatments, and endless dirty soda bars, but what the show really offers viewers is a deep dive into a pocket of culture they likely haven't experienced before. \"I did not think [the show] would do as well as it did,\" says Paul. \"When it popped off, it was all over, especially on social media where we do our job. So to me, I was like, 'What in the heck is going on that people are liking this?' I didn't think the soda would be a big deal with anyone. I feel like everyone outside of Utah drinks coffee or tea or alcohol. People are getting curious [with dirty sodas] and I know they're opening up more places now, which I didn't think would ever survive in another state besides Utah.\" In season two, we saw a more understanding version of Paul, especially when it came to letting former MomTok rival Whitney Leavitt back into the group. Even Paul was surprised by this version of herself. \"I'm more forgiving than I thought I was,\" she says. \"I definitely thought I held grudges, which obviously I think I have in the past, but over time, I'm very forgiving and I can let things go. And I think the more I grow and do therapy work, the more I've been able to tolerate and let things go quicker.\" What's to Come - Treatments and Otherwise As Paul says, Mormons aim for perfection, and this is certainly seen in the cast of \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives,\" who visit med spas together and document their plastic surgeries online. \"I want to eventually get a nose job,\" Paul says. \"It's just a time thing. I also get fearful, to be honest, of changing my face. It can be scary.\" After all of the success that Paul has found over the last few years, you might expect her to say she's ready to go into acting, modeling, or something else to push her even further into the limelight, but she has a different idea for her future. \"I have just been manifesting some peace,\" she says. \"My life has been in adrenaline rush for three years nonstop.\" What's not on her vision board is rekindling her relationship with her \"baby daddy,\" as she calls him, Dakota. \"I don't really want a relationship,\" she says. \"I'm usually very codependent and I want to just be on my own for a little bit and grow and enjoy my own company. I'm manifesting to learn how to do that.\" Brittany Leitner (she/her) is a New York-based contributing beauty writer at PS.
