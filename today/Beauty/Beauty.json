    "title": "6 Steps To Cultivating ‘Good Hair Energy,’ According To An Intuitive Stylist",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/haircut-energy-stylist-advice?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "We often talk about haircuts from a purely visual perspective — your hairstylist asks, “What are we doing today?” Your answer: “Just a trim,” or “I’m thinking about a bob…” — but when we focus on the strict aesthetics of the cut, we often discount the energy shift happening at your appointment. Like everything else, hair holds energy, and it’s common to experience a flood of emotions before a haircut or a sense of release afterward. Maybe you’re blocked energetically and can’t figure out what you want to do with your hair. Luckily, many hairstylists are intuitively sensitive to energies and take extra time to talk their clients through their cut using a mindfulness approach, if they’re open to it. The result? A better, more personalized haircut in the short term, and a healthier relationship with your hair when you leave the salon. To delve deeper into the energy component of my pre-fall haircut, I got on the phone with NYC-based hairstylist Andrean Noir. While Noir doesn’t call herself an “intuitive” or “energy-focused” hairstylist, many of her clients and co-workers do. She admits that her salon chair (at Bumble and Bumble salon in the Meatpacking District) has a metaphorical ottoman for her “sessions” where clients can get comfortable before going in for a big haircut, like chopping their long hair into a chin-length bob (which has been “super popular lately,” she says). With Noir and other energy-aligned stylists, the approach does not invite all your problems (like the trouble you’re having with your boss, or in dating) into the hair appointment; that’s a slippery slope to trauma dumping on your hairdresser. Instead, it’s about unpacking and verbalizing your current relationship with your hair and how you want it to evolve. Ahead, Noir speaks to the six ways we can improve the energy we bring into the hair salon and the way we talk about our hair in general, which will make a big difference in your next appointment. Ask yourself, am I seeking advice or validation? One of the prevailing patterns across Noir’s clientele (she keeps her client list private but works with many influencers confidentially) is self-doubt and a desire for validation. “I don’t know if it’s a trend, but I’m seeing that people are ready to cut their hair off, but they doubt themselves,” says Noir. The doubt manifests as thinking about a haircut, and then “asking everyone around them if they should do it them 10 times” before going through with it, says Noir.  “I’m seeing that people are ready to cut their hair off, but they doubt themselves.” While feedback can be helpful in some cases, in regards to honing your sense, it can often create confusion. “If you’re asking someone with long hair if you should cut your hair short, they’re going to have their own perspective,” explains Noir. Instead, if you want to ask for advice before a haircut, consider who you talk to. “Ask people with the haircut you like,” she says. People will bring their own opinions based on their experiences, but you are the only one who knows your hair and lives with it every day, so trust your instincts. Reframe your language We could all stand to be more mindful of how we speak about our hair. You may be subconsciously adding negativity to a neutral or healthy hair experience. It’s not your fault — beauty marketing has caused a lot of cultural shame around “frizz’” and “grays” — but you can shift your perspective to a more positive one.  “It’s one of the saddest things when I hear someone who has any type of texture — whether it’s gray hair that’s a little more textured, curly hair, or even someone with really fine hair — that talks about their hair being ‘frizzy,'” says Noir. “They associate that with negativity.” But the reality is that we lose up to 150 hairs a day, and that ‘frizz’ is often brand-new hair coming back, explains Noir: “Your hair is healthy, it’s growing — those are baby hairs!”  “Your hair is healthy, it’s growing — those are baby hairs!”  Of course, if you want to control those baby hairs, certain hot tools and products can help, and your stylist can work with you to find the right one for your hair type. However, taking an energy audit and reframing your language can save you a lot of frustration and help you get to a place of greater compassion. Remember, your face shape has no bearing on your hair Those ‘90s magazines didn’t age well. Noir still hears a lot of women putting limitations on their haircut due to their “face shape” — which almost always is attached to negative energy. “I hear, ‘I could never wear that [haircut] because my face is too long and skinny,’ or ‘my nose is too big.’ I hate hearing that,” says Noir. What a haircut can do is accentuate the facial features that you like. For example, if you love your eyes, you can add a long bang that curves around your eyes. But it’s 2024, and there are no rules or prescriptions to what you “can’t” or “shouldn’t” do with your haircut. Your inspiration photos are probably professional Before a haircut, many of us go to Instagram or Pinterest to pull visual references, which is great because it helps a hairstylist better understand the look you’re going for. The trouble is that many of us forget that Instagram is a highlight reel. As for the celeb or influencer you’re referencing? They probably got a blowout.  “Everyone sees a hairstyle that they like without understanding that the hair has been styled professionally,” explains Noir. That sense of awareness can be helpful when it comes to the energy you bring to your haircut, which is all of a sudden more realistic. “There is no way to cut someone’s hair so that you wake up and have volume,” adds Noir, “but there is a way to cut the hair to enhance volume by the way you style it.” Consider the way you’re touching your hair If you wake up in the morning and you’re immediately annoyed with your hair and pull it back, it’s probably time for a haircut. Noir calls this “morning frustration,” and says it’s a “breaking point” that happens when your hair is not falling as it once did or how you want it to because it has grown out. One response is to pull your hair back and up and deal with it. But this plays back into the language piece: If you’re handling your hair like it’s heavy or a burden, you’re in a negative energy space. Instead, shift to a proactive energy and book a haircut. “Appreciate that you are going to a professional and this is where that frustrated feeling is going to end.” Get excited about your haircut! Of course, if you’re feeling frustrated about your hair, it’s natural to bring that stress and anxiety into your appointment. But remember, you’re doing something about it. “Appreciate that you are going to a professional and this is where that frustrated feeling is going to end,” offers Noir. Give yourself some credit for just making an appointment. “You’ve gotten yourself here, and now someone is going to help you,” says Noir. Now, your hair will always be your hair and there’s only so much you can do with cut and color to change it. What is fully in your control is your perspective, and Noir has changed mine to a more positive place. I’m no scientist, but since being nicer to myself and my hair and channeling positivity ahead of my haircut, I gotta say, it’s been looking a lot better. Like what you see?

Vitamin C is undoubtedly a household name in skincare; most of us have probably tried a vitamin C serum at some point, and might even have one sitting on the bathroom shelf right now. While it is a powerhouse antioxidant for protecting skin against pollution, evening out skin tone, fading dark spots, and giving you an all-around glow, it can be a little too much for those of us with sensitive skin. “Vitamin C, especially in its pure form (ascorbic acid), can sometimes cause irritation, especially at higher concentrations,” explains consultant dermatologist Dr. Rakesh Anand. “It has a lower pH [between 3 and 3.5, whereas the average adult has a skin pH of 5.7]. This sometimes leads to disruption of the skin barrier [the outermost layer of the skin], resulting in redness or a stinging sensation.” It’s also notoriously unstable and can degrade quickly when exposed to light, heat, or air. If your skin hasn’t taken to vitamin C all that well, there’s no need to fret: There are plenty of gentler alternatives to vitamin C that still deliver those glow-boosting, spot-fading, and antioxidant benefits — minus the irritation. We went straight to the experts to get the lowdown on the best vitamin C alternatives and, of course, their go-to product recommendations. DashDividers_1_500x100 Niacinamide What is niacinamide, and why is it good for the skin? Niacinamide, also known as vitamin B3 or nicotinamide, has been deemed a powerhouse skincare ingredient in recent years thanks to its ability to address a laundry list of skin concerns. We asked Shenaz Sharrif, advanced aesthetics practitioner and founder of The Face and Body Clinic, to give us a detailed rundown. “Niacinamide strengthens the skin’s natural barrier, which helps to retain moisture and protects against environmental stressors such as pollution and UV radiation,” she says. “It also reduces the appearance of enlarged pores, evens out skin tone, diminishes dullness, and makes the skin more plump and firm.” One big advantage this ingredient has over vitamin C is that niacinamide doesn’t oxidize as quickly, which means it will remain stable and effective for longer periods, even when the product is exposed to light and air. One crucial thing you should never forget? Follow up with your favorite sunscreen; niacinamide’s antioxidant properties help enhance the skin’s resilience against environmental damage. The best niacinamide skincare, according to experts Sharrif highly rates Paula’s Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster, $49. “This lightweight serum is designed to be mixed with your moisturizer or used on its own,” she explains. “It helps to refine skin texture, reduce the appearance of pores, and brighten dull skin. Suitable for all skin types, it’s a powerful addition to any skincare routine.” For a more budget-friendly option, Sharrif recommends The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%, $10.80. “This affordable yet highly effective serum combines a high concentration of niacinamide with zinc to target blemishes, congestion, and uneven skin tone,” she says. “It’s a popular choice for those looking to reduce the appearance of pores and improve skin texture.” More niacinamide skincare we love DashDividers_1_500x100 Green Tea Extract What is green tea extract, and why is it good for the skin? Make no mistake: This skincare ingredient has very little to do with your favorite green tea latte. Green tea extract is derived from the leaves of the camellia sinensis plant and is known for its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties. “This ingredient is packed with powerful antioxidants called polyphenols, which help protect your skin from damage caused by the environment,” says Amanda Azzopardi, advanced nurse practitioner. “However, it’s much more gentle on the skin than vitamin C, given that it’s a natural antioxidant with soothing properties. Additionally, green tea extract helps reduce oil production and fight acne, and is also great at calming rosacea.” The best green tea extract skincare, according to experts When it comes to skincare with green tea extract, K-beauty brands are your best bet. Azzopardi recommends the Innisfree Green Tea Hyaluronic Acid Refillable Serum, $30, which is enriched with green tea seed. “This is my go-to hydrating serum to soothe and protect my skin,” she says.

Azelaic acid is probably a familiar name to anyone with acne-prone skin. Known for its anti-inflammatory and brightening properties, the ingredient is commonly used to treat acne and rosacea. It also helps reduce pigmentation and gently exfoliates the skin, making it look brighter and more even in tone. “Azelaic acid is generally milder on the skin compared to vitamin C, particularly for sensitive or acne-prone skin,” says Dr. Rakesh Anand, consultant dermatologist. “It’s well-tolerated by most skin types, even at higher concentrations, and is less likely to cause irritation, redness, or stinging.” One thing to keep in mind is that while azelaic acid is generally well-tolerated, it can increase your skin’s sensitivity to the sun, so it’s important to use sunscreen during the day. “When you’re using azelaic acid, combining it with other strong active ingredients like retinoids or exfoliating acids might increase irritation,” Anand adds. “Try introducing them gradually to avoid any adverse reactions.” The best azelaic acid skincare, according to experts Anand recommends SkinCeuticals Phyto A+ Brightening Treatment, $110, a lightweight moisturizer with 3% azelaic acid aimed to target clogged pores, redness, and excess oil production. It also contains plant-based ingredients to calm the skin, such as olive leaf and thyme. More azelaic acid skincare we love DashDividers_1_500x100 Mandelic Acid What is mandelic acid, and why is it good for the skin? Mandelic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) from bitter almonds and is commonly used as a gentle exfoliator, but like vitamin C, it boasts antioxidant properties, too. “Mandelic acid has a larger molecular structure compared to other AHAs, like glycolic acid, which allows it to penetrate the skin more slowly and reduce the risk of irritation,” explains Anand. It’s effective in treating a range of skin concerns, including dullness, texture, acne, and hyperpigmentation. The best mandelic acid skincare, according to experts The Medik8 Surface Radiance Cleanse, $27, is a favorite of both Anand and myself. It’s a clear gel that foams up easily and leaves my pores feeling freshly decongested, without drying out my skin. Ingredients like mandelic acid, lactic acid, and salicylic acid gently exfoliate and brighten up the complexion. More mandelic acid skincare we love DashDividers_1_500x100 Ferulic Acid What is ferulic acid, and why is it good for the skin? Ferulic acid is a powerful antioxidant found naturally in the cell walls of plants like oats, rice bran, and apples. While it works well on its own for neutralizing harmful free radicals (unstable molecules emitted from air pollutants and cigarette smoke, for example) and reducing signs of aging, it’s often found in combination with other antioxidants, such as vitamin C and niacinamide, to maximize their effects. “Ferulic acid helps stabilize vitamin C, making it more effective and longer lasting,” explains Anand. “In fact, when combined with vitamin E and ferulic acid, vitamin C’s benefits — brightening skin, reducing hyperpigmentation, aiding collagen production — are significantly boosted.” The best ferulic acid skincare, according to experts Many popular serums often include a mix of ferulic acid and other active ingredients. This is true in the case of SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic, $182, a cult-favorite serum — and a particular favorite of Anand’s. “Combining vitamin C, vitamin E, and ferulic acid for a powerful antioxidant boost, this serum helps protect your skin against environmental damage [such as UV rays and pollutants] and improves the appearance of fine lines,” he says.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Last year, I had the opportunity to travel to Toronto to hear all about The Ordinary’s newly reformulated Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 serum, which had been “renovated” to reduce tackiness and improve hydration levels thanks to the addition of ceramides in the formula. I loved it, but no matter how good a reformulation is, one thing is almost certainly guaranteed: People — many of them — will be left heartbroken and pine for the original. (Ahem, Givenchy Prisme Libre.) Well, we’ve got some very good news to report: As of today (and just in time for spooky season), The Ordinary has officially resurrected its original Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 serum from the grave. (After all, nothing’s scarier than dry, unhappy skin.) While this is not replacing the new version, the brand heard feedback and decided to do something about it. “When Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 with Ceramides was launched, we heard from some loyal community members that they, in fact, preferred the original formulation,” Nicola Kilner, the co-founder and CEO of DECIEM, parent company of The Ordinary, exclusively tells Refinery29. “[They] found that the original worked well for their skin type and concerns and had been avid users for a long time, therefore the change didn’t suit their regimen as it once had.” Kilner adds that fans of the OG formula didn’t necessarily dislike the new version, either — they just wanted options. Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 (Original Formulation), $6 While it’s music to our ears, at the same time, the decision is not entirely surprising. After all, hyaluronic acid is somewhat of a divisive skincare ingredient in beauty circles. Still, you don’t see many brands keeping two versions of the same product to appease customers, especially when certain concerns led to it being remade in the first place. The Ordinary’s reformulated hyaluronic acid serum was born from some consumers disliking the sticky texture. “We are always listening to feedback across our social channels and reviews, and so are thrilled to be able to act on both asks, the new and the original,” Kilner explains. “However, with so many loyal fans of the original formulation expressing that they preferred the simpler formulation’s texture and results, we decided to bring it back and offer our community the choice between the two.” As for how the brand plans to avoid confusion among the two versions, Kilner shared that Deciem plans to include clear labeling differences on the packaging and online product pages, in addition to outlining the different claims with each version. (With the addition of ceramides, the brand claims that the reformulated version has added support for the skin barrier, plus improvement in the appearance of fine lines, skin elasticity, and suppleness.) That’s not even the best part: The Ordinary’s Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 is not just being brought back, but at its original price of $6. (The reformulated version retails at $9.90 a bottle.) “This is to ensure we remain accessible to customers.” Kilner says. “The slightly higher price of Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 with Ceramides reflects the more complex formulation, which includes an additional form of hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid and ceramides. The lower price of Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 reflects the more simple formulation, which contains four forms of hyaluronic acid and pro-vitamin B5.” As for when you’ll be able to reunite with the iconic HA serum? You can currently shop it on The Ordinary’s website, with a rollout to The Ordinary stores and select retailers to follow. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

It always delivers the best beauty trends. Think warm, ambery perfumes and vampy lips. When we’re talking about nails in particular, the shift from summer brights to deeper, sultrier shades undeniably appeals. So it’s no surprise that with Halloween arriving in just a few weeks, the internet has been serving up a banquet of playful nail art looks. Sure, there are plenty of pumpkins and ghouls to satisfy all of our inner emo kids, but dare I say that this year’s offering will also appeal to those who like a more pared-back approach to nail art. Ahead, find the very best spooky-yet-chic Halloween nail looks to inspire your next manicure.  Devil Horns View this post on Instagram A post shared by Georgia | Russian Manicures, BIAB, Gel \u0026 Elim | Hillingdon (@gel.bygeorgia) I never thought I’d be describing a manicure bedecked with devil horns as chic, but here we are. Georgia’s minimalist mani pairs the most perfectly executed neutral manicure with teeny devil horns and tail detailing. Choose an on-trend cherry-red shade like OPI Chick Flick Nail Lacquer, to try it for yourself.  Bat Wings View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sydney (@nailsbysmf) At first glance this looks like a chic monochromatic take on a classic French manicure. Look again and you’ll spot how nail artist and digital creator Sydney has transformed each black tip into a midnight-black bat. Obsessed.  Slime Tips View this post on Instagram A post shared by Stefanie ☀️ | Nail Art Inspo (@polished_yogi) These glow-in-the-dark nail tips remind me of a ‘90s Goosebumps book cover in nail art form — and they’re surprisingly wearable. Stefanie’s take on Halloween nails can be recreated at home with OPI OPI’m Phosphorescent! Nail Topper. Vampy Lengths View this post on Instagram A post shared by Queenie Nguyen | elevated nail artist (@nailartbyqueenie) Queenie Nguyen’s ultra-long manicure oozes gothic glamour — from the licorice-black shade to the elegant negative-space strip down the middle. These are the kind of nails that Morticia Addams would be happy to be caught dead in.  Pumpkin Aura View this post on Instagram A post shared by Marnie ♡ (@thenaillologist) Orange is, of course, the color of the season and no Halloween nail inspiration would be complete without a little pumpkin spice. This one from Marnie teams orange French tips with aura nails and the sweetest pumpkin motif.  Magic Space View this post on Instagram A post shared by JASMIN (@basecoatstories) Combining Halloween hues — oranges and blacks — with a delicate scattering of stars and moons, Jasmin’s witchy manicure does sound like a bit of a seasonal cliché. However, the use of negative space and the fresh, ballerina-pink base color keeps it looking bright and modern. Chrome Cobwebs View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lilianna ✨ (@_nailsbylilly__) Metallic nails are huge for fall/winter 2024 so these gleaming silver cobwebs created by Lilianna feel absolutely on-trend while also being perfect for the spooky season. Try OPI Work From Chrome, if you want a cool chrome shade to recreate the look at home.  Checkerboard Chic View this post on Instagram A post shared by Beyoutiful By Rachie (@beyoutifulbyrachie) Rachie’s monochrome manicure is like the fever dream of a teenage skater kid. Alongside the retro checkerboard print there are flame French tips and a jet-black colorblock nail. It’s undeniably fun yet totally wearable — and OPI Black Onyx Nail Lacquer, is the perfect shade for that expensive, glossy finish.  Starry Night View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nayla Smith | Midsize Fashion (@style.by.nayla) Forget pumpkins; celestial nail art is where it’s at this October. Nayla Smith’s star and moon design is so chic and works just as well for Halloween as it would for Christmas.  If the above is a little too busy for your liking, take inspiration from this pared-down set by nail artist and educator Bryony Howell.

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find the best things to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.Just because the dark evenings have arrived doesn’t mean we need to be picking Halloween costumes just yet. The recent spring/summer 2025 shows may have had brighter days in mind but the layering, structured outerwear, and bold prints we saw on the runways in New York, London, Milan, and Paris work just as well for fall.In London, Chopova Lowena showcased patterned tights alongside metal hardware and three-quarter-length, snake-print leather jackets. In New York, all eyes were on LaQuan Smith’s military-style shirts, translucent trench coats, and oxblood feathered jackets. And was there anyone who didn't go weak at the knees for Saint Laurent? The show in Paris brought back the brand founder’s famous tailored look with 1980s-style shoulder pads, polka dot ties, and heavy leather bomber jackets.When it came to beauty, Tolu Coker made the case for 1960s glamour at her London Fashion Week show, with models donning voluminous beehives and graphic black and white eyeliner with diffused corners. Harris Reed went one step further with full doll eyes complete with long, sticky lashes and warm, golden bronze eyeshadows. But it was perhaps Luar who best channeled the vampiness of the season with glossy black lips and exaggerated brows.If all that isn’t enough inspiration for the season ahead, we’ve got plenty of new launches on our radar which are sparking our imagination this October. To find out all the latest beauty products and fashion collections catching our attention, click through the slideshow ahead…All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.Glossier You Rêve and You DouxThe original Glossier You eau de parfum became a viral sensation for smelling completely different on everyone. Now, the brand is bringing two new dreamy fragrances into the fold, this time with more distinctive personalities. Housed in a crushed grape-colored bottle, You Rêve is all about sweet warmth with notes including buttercream, toasted almond and plum butter alongside spicy sandalwood. For those in search of something less fruity, You Doux is the sophisticated older sister scent, offering a softer mix of notes. Blending earthy palo santo, frankincense and sweet violet, the perfume delivers a musky woodiness that’s perfect for fall. Both fragrances are vegan and cruelty-free.Shop now at GlossierGlossier Glossier You Rêve, $, available at GlossierUGG New Heights CollectionIt’s officially “boots with the fur” season, which makes UGG’s latest platform footwear perfectly timed. Featuring the brand’s first-ever heeled designs, the New Heights collection adds a touch of glamour to the everyday with a range of heel heights across classic and new silhouettes. The stand-out for sure is the Xtra Boot, a full suede, knee-high design that we wouldn’t be shocked to see Sabrina Carpenter wearing on her upcoming Christmas special. If you’re searching for something more subtle, there’s also an ultra mini low boot with a 1.5\" heel height and a range of heeled cozy clogs in neutral colorways that could rival the Tasman’s popularity. Catch us looking cozy (and tall) in this collection throughout fall.Shop now at UGGUgg New Heights Platform Xtra, $, available at UggBebe x CiaraDespite being a nostalgic brand for many, Bebe continues to be discovered by new generations: The label is currently all over TikTok thanks to its diamanté Y2K spaghetti tops and fitted hoodies. It continues to innovate, this season tapping pop/R\u0026B icon Ciara as creative director for a capsule collection. While many of the looks are ready for center stage (the leopard-print catsuit is giving serious Scary Spice vibes), there are plenty of casual date-night pieces. However, if what you want this season is to be toasty and talked about, look no further than the head-turning, faux-fur olive maxi coat.Shop now at BebeBebe x Ciara Faux Fur Maxi Coat, $, available at bebeDr Dennis Gross DermInfusions Blur + Repair CreamWe all know that colder weather can lead to dry, inflamed skin, which is why a nourishing moisturizer is a must come autumn. Luckily, dermatologist Dr Dennis Gross has expanded the DermInfusions line just in time for the mercury to drop, launching a new Blur and Repair Cream that delivers serious hydration. Containing rich shea butter and skin barrier-boosting ceramides, the cream aims to improve elasticity while hydrating hyaluronic acid and skin-strengthening peptides draw in moisture, leaving a plump and glowing base for makeup application. The formula is non-comedogenic, too, so it’s less likely to cause breakouts.Shop now at SephoraDr. Dennis Gross DermInfusions™ Blur + Repair Cream, $, available at SephoraDaily Paper x ConverseDaily Paper, which started out in Amsterdam in 2012, celebrates African culture through its luxurious pieces boasting monogram prints. This October, the label is collaborating with footwear giant Converse on a range of unisex sneakers and clothing, the most eye-catching of which has to be the playful Chuck 70s featuring black logo embroidery, contrast multicolored stitching, and interchangeable laces available in red, yellow, and green. Those searching for something more stealthy might enjoy the Chuck 70 De Luxe Squared, with its all-black snub-toe silhouette and brightly colored bottoms; those wanting something more snuggly should check out the logo fleece hoodie and sweatpants. Shop now at ConverseConverse x Daily Paper Chuck 70 Sneakers, $, available at ConverseGU x Rokh Just weeks after launching in the US, Uniqlo’s sister brand GU is making another splash in the fashion scene by dropping a collab with former H\u0026M collaborator Rokh. The 16-piece collection experiments with tailoring and layering through fall-ready pieces like quilted jackets, skirts over pants, sweaters with armholes, and a combo bustier/button-front top. Gu x Rokh will be available to shop on October 18, with prices ranging from $29.90 to $99.90.Shop on October 18 at GUGu x Rokh Striped Sailor Collar Sweater, $, available at GUGu x Rokh Hoodie Scarf, $, available at GUGu x Rokh 2 Piece Skirt And Pants Set Checked, $, available at GUGu x Rokh Mary Jane Shoes, $, available at GUStarface Hydro-Star Recovery PatchThe main benefit of a pimple patch is to gently draw out gunk; generally speaking, they do very little to reduce the angry redness that often accompanies an acne breakout. That’s where Starface’s new recovery patches enter the picture. While the brand’s famous yellow stars aim to shrink spots, the new purple patches are designed to soothe inflammation after an (ill-advised) picking sesh. Containing soothing aloe vera and vitamin A to promote cell turnover, the recovery stars are all about bringing down redness fast. With the addition of licorice root to help with scarring, these patches put in the work to heal skin and get rid of the evidence.Shop now at StarfaceStarface hydro-star® recovery, $, available at StarfacePleasing x Disney Fantasia Revel in the nostalgic magic of the 1940s animated classic Fantasia with Pleasing’s latest collaboration. The Harry Styles-backed brand has partnered with Disney on a line of apparel, accessories, and beauty products inspired by the film. Find three nail polish sets (each of which borrows cues from different segments of the movie), a new edition of the Big Lip HA Moisture Balm, hoodies, tote bags, and more. “When visiting the Disney archives, we had the opportunity to look through lots of archived and special illustrations which was very exciting — especially as a child who went to the Disney parks — getting a peek behind the curtains of how these beautiful movies and moments are made felt truly inspiring,” Pleasing creative director Harry Lambert said, in a press release. “From very early on, Fantasia was always in the front of our minds at Pleasing; the aesthetics, the mood, the bold illustrations, the colors, and, ultimately, the epic world that Disney has created, were very much a world that resonated with Pleasing.” Prices range from $25 to $289.Shop now at PleasingPleasing x Disney Fantasia L’Apprenti Sorcier Tote in Blue, $, available at PleasingREFY Plum Lip CollectionThe onset of autumn might have some people thinking of sunset-colored trees, cinnamon drinks, and baked pumpkin goods; for us, it’s all about the arrival of vampy makeup. A wine-stained lip is arguably the most sophisticated makeup trend for this time of year and REFY is joining the party with a brand-new, plum-hued lip combo. Comprising a dome-shaped Blur Liner and tinted lip gloss, the kit lends a plummy ombre effect that can be diffused by day and built up for a statement look come cocktail hour. Shop now at REFYREFY Plum Lip Collection, $, available at REFYCharlotte Simone Winter DropBritish designer Charlotte Simone has been known for her It-girl coats for quite some time. Taking inspiration from 1970s silhouettes, her Penny Lane-style jackets with flamboyant fluffy collars and larger-than-life shearling cuffs have been seen on everyone from Dua Lipa to Charli XCX to Florence Pugh. This autumn, the label is offering a sleeveless faux-suede vest, leather bomber and leopard-print Mongolian lambswool coat. If you aren’t ready to go full Almost Famous, the latest drop also includes some shaggy ombre scarves to liven up just about any layer.Shop now at Charlotte SimoneCharlotte Simone Naomi, $, available at Charlotte SimoneLike what you see?

Shop our full coverage of the event here — or, dive directly into the deals here. Crest Whitestrips are the unofficial (but nevertheless uncontested) star deal of Prime Days past — and for good reason. The highly rated teeth-whitening system rarely gets more than a paltry discount; however, Prime Big Deal Days is the rare occasion when Crest Whitestrips reliably go for $30 — a serious steal if you ask us. And now that October’s Prime Big Deal Days are finally here, Crest Whitestrips are (spoiler alert) part of the drill. In addition to various Whitestrips kit options, you can save big on other oral care essentials like toothpaste, electric toothbrushes, floss, and more. Perhaps the most widely-carted item from the bunch is Crest’s 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects, marked down to $29.99 from $45.99, which boasts over 89,000 reviews as of press time. Another popular choice is the Crest 3D Whitestrips Radiant Express which one reviewer has dubbed “as you can get without going to a dentist.” And speaking of, if you want to more closely mimic the professional teeth-whitening experience you’d get at the dentist, there is the Crest 3D Whitestrips with Light Whitening Kit, to help achieve your brightest pearly whites ever by enhancing the effects of the brightening gel via LED light.  Ahead, peruse every Crest Whitestrips kit on sale for Prime Big Deal Days and shop the smile-worthy deals below.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Have you ever loved a fragrance so much, you wish it came in shower gel, candle, body lotion, and even car freshener form? Well I feel this way about Ellis Brooklyn’s Vanilla Milk — a perfume that marries two types of comforting vanilla with lush rose, moreish frangipani and creamy milk. If you’re just as obsessed, you’ll understand my excitement when I tell you that the brand has expanded its fan-favorite scent. Introducing the Vanilla Milk Shimmering Scented Body Oil. It’s equally as incredible as the OG fragrance but now with heaps of added champagne sparkle — and I predict a sell-out. “I’ve always thought of Vanilla Milk as wonderfully indulgent,” Ellis Brooklyn founder Bee Shapiro exclusively tells Refinery29. “There’s a feeling to the scent that reminds me of fall or winter pampering. I wanted to capture that in a champagne shimmer formula that mimicked our box packaging — and also felt festive.”  Ellis Brooklyn Vanilla Milk Shimmering Scented Body Oil, $70 We’ve seen a few of our favorite fragrance brands launch body oil versions of beloved scents as of late, and it makes total sense: Not only do body oils moisturize the skin deeply, but they are often a more affordable way to try a scent before committing to a full-size eau de parfum. Ellis’ Vanilla Milk was already a personal favorite of mine (not to mention, a 2022 R29 Beauty Innovator Award winner), and as a child of the 2000s, I have a bit of a soft spot for shimmery body products (especially ones that smell like dessert). But lest you expect chunky, see-it-from-space glitter, think again: Ellis’ Vanilla Milk Shimmering Scented Body Oil bestows a hint of super-fine shimmer that reads as more of a glow enhancer than body highlighter. “I think shimmer can look flattering at a holiday party but also equally at a pool party,” Shapiro tells us. (Facts!) As for the process of transforming an existing scent from an alcohol base to an oil one, Shapiro reveals that the journey of keeping the scent consistent was less challenging than you may think. “The Vanilla Milk scent actually lives better in a non-alcoholic base,” she explains — perfect for those who want a longer-lasting fragrance. “If you smell a lactonic [milky or creamy] scent too early after spraying a perfume, you may get turned off by what people say are ‘sour’ notes. If you wait a few seconds, the alcohol will evaporate and you’re left with a gorgeous creamy fragrance.”  And she’s right: As soon as I applied the oil, it blossomed into a delicious gourmand (comforting and sweet but not saccharine) that lingered on my skin — and for a surprisingly long amount of time. I applied it in the morning and could still smell it when I took an afternoon shower. I love wearing it alone on my arms, legs, and chest, or layered with another scent for more impact. (For a recent date, I added a few spritzes of Gucci Flora Gorgeous Orchid Eau de Parfum, a vanilla-floral that paired perfectly with Ellis’ romantic and sensual Vanilla Milk.) Ellis Brooklyn’s Vanilla Milk Shimmering Scented Body Oil launches October 7 and retails for $70 for a 3.2 fluid-ounce bottle. (In comparison, the 1.7 fl. oz eau de parfum goes for $110, so it’s not a bad deal at all.) And while it’s too early to call, we’re willing to bet that this will be a highly-coveted gift for all the beauty lovers who have been good this year.  Like what you see?

    "description": "We thought we had seen every twist on the classic french manicure possible - but oh, were we wrong. There's a new take on the throwback trend (and one we should have seen coming with the invisible french, the glazed-doughnut french, and many more cool iterations), only this one literally flips the traditional design upside down. Meet the reverse french manicure. Of course, we shouldn't be surprised by this take - especially with so many A-listers in Hollywood showing their support for the many different iterations of the design. The reverse french manicure, otherwise known as the inverted french manicure, is simple yet so visually pleasing. It looks just how you'd imagine: the cuticle is painted a solid color instead of the tip of the nails. As with any nail-art design, there are so many different shades you can choose from when trying out this trend. Chrissy Teigen, Megan Thee Stallion, Blake Lively, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Dove Cameron are all fans of reverse manicures. That should be all the proof you need to understand that the reverse french mani isn't going anywhere anytime soon. If you're stuck in a manicure rut, get inspiration for the nail trend taking this year by storm. We compiled a list of some of our favorite versions of the reverse french manicure that you'll want to save for later.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/it-cosmetics-superhero-mascara-review-49329307",
    "description": "I've been a fan of IT Cosmetics for as long as I can remember. I first fell in love with the brand after trying its beloved CC+ Cream, which remains one of my favorites to this day. This pattern has become familiar over the years: each time I test any of its latest releases, I find myself consistently impressed. Among the standout products that followed the CC+ Cream is the Superhero Mascara ($28). As a beauty editor constantly sampling the latest offerings to stay up to date with the best products of the year, I've tried too many mascaras to count. To this day, to this day Superhero continues to be one of my tried-and-true favorites. What makes it so good? Ahead, I break down everything you need to know about it before adding it to your cart. Keep reading for my full review. About the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara first launched in 2016, and the waterproof version followed in 2023. It's formulated and designed to lengthen and add volume to your lashes. It's infused with collagen, biotin, proteins, and peptides to condition lashes while enhancing their appearance. What I Love About the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara What I love about the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara is how well it enhances the volume and length of my super-straight lashes without clumping them together. Before applying any mascara, I use my Tweezerman eyelash curler. Without it, I've noticed that mascara tends to weigh down my lashes, counteracting my goal to add volume. In the below photo, you'll see my left eye in its natural state (without having used an eyelash curler) and the right eye prepped without mascara, just freshly curled. (The difference is jarring, I know.) How to Use the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara Applying IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara is straightforward. I start by curling my lashes, then use the mascara wand to sweep and wiggle the product from root to tip. Two coats usually do the trick, and I'm good for the entire day. This mascara is my go-to for no-makeup-makeup looks, ideal when I want natural makeup but lashes that really pop. For days when I have an afternoon workout planned, I opt for the waterproof version ($28), which effortlessly withstands sweat and - when my CorePower Sculpt classes really take a toll - tears. Below is a photo of how my lashes look after freshly applying the Superhero Mascara. It's night and day from the lifeless lashes I started with. (And yes, they really stay like that until it's time to whip out the makeup remover.) What to Consider Before Trying the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara It's important to be aware that some users of IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara have reported clumping, as noted in the reviews. My tip is to remember that less is more with this product, as the formula is quite thick. I recommend prepping your lashes for application by combing them and removing any excess product from the mascara wand before use. If you see a glob of mascara on the wand, gently wipe it off on a tissue to ensure a smoother application. Although these additional steps might seem inconvenient, it's worth noting that not all users, including myself, have dealt with clumping. Another thing worth noting? The IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara also comes in a travel-size version ($17), if you're interested in giving it a test run before investing in the full-size tube. Who Is the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara Best For? IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara is best for those like me who want to level up their lashes with volume and length. It's a great option for all ages, given that it's infused with collagen, biotin, and peptides that condition your lashes as you coat them. While choosing a mascara is highly subjective, in my opinion, this one is worth experimenting with at least once. It might be a game-changer for you, as it was for me. Where Is the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara Available? IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara is available direct-to-consumer via the brand's website, Sephora, Ulta Beauty, and on Amazon.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/laneige-lip-sleeping-mask-review-48879903",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy Very few cult-favorite beauty products have brought me as much joy as the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask ($24). Ever since laying my hands on a little tub of it for the first time years ago, it's remained a staple on my bedside table, in my handbag, and on my work desk, just to name a few spots I have them stashed. (Yes, I proudly own several flavors.) I'm obsessed with everything about this lip mask, from its pretty pink packaging to its hydrating, nonsticky texture. The lip mask is available in classic flavors like Berry and Vanilla, but occasionally, Laneige throws a limited-edition one into the mix. They unveiled Pink Lemonade Swirl in May 2022 (and fans are begging for its return now that it's unavailable). Luckily, the brand just released its 2024 holiday flavors: Candy Cane Swirl and Eggnog Latte. Image Source: Sephora With a reputation as one of the best lip masks on the market, the product has become a viral sensation - PS editors love it, beauty influencers love it, and the hydrating product even boasts a few celebrity fans. Charli XCX called it one of her everyday essentials in an interview with British GQ - perfect for brat summer and beyond - and Ashley Park named it her sleeping must have in an interview with PS. As you might guess, I wasted no time in getting my hands on these tubs, and I can confidently say that they have become new staples in my everyday routine. Ahead, you can read my full review of the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, and see why it's worth the hype. About the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask The formula first made its debut in the US in 2015 with its bestselling flavor, Berry. Each mask is formulated with hydrating hyaluronic acid, moisture-locking glycerin, and skin-protecting antioxidants. It comes in four core flavors: the original Berry, Sweet Candy, Vanilla, and Gummy Bear. But, the brand releases limited edition seasonal flavors, like Watermelon Pop and Mango for the summer, and Candy Cane Swirl and Eggnog Latte for the winter. What I Like About the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy I've always been the type of person who reaches for fruity scents over the sweet ones, and Pink Lemonade Swirl and Mango were just as delectably summery as I had hoped. The Mango flavor captures the fruit's smell perfectly and the Pink Lemonade Swirl is like sipping on a refreshing glass of the real deal. (I know this sounds annoyingly cliché, but I'm telling it like it is - I swear.) As for what it looks and feels like: it's a lusciously thick formula with a silky-soft texture and a glossy finish. I agree with our former content director, Macy Cate Williams, who reviewed the original Berry formula and said: \"This lip mask isn't sticky or uncomfortable - it glides on smoothly and feels very soothing on my lips.\" Like her, I'm also a fan of using it instead of a regular lip balm throughout the day. The tiniest amount goes a long way, so even with multiple applications daily, it lasts a while. What to Consider Before Buying Laneige Lip Sleeping Masks When considering Laneige's lip sleeping masks, one important factor to keep in mind is the cost. At $24, this balm comes with a higher price tag, and it's worth noting that there are comparable products available at a lower cost. However, the masks' sleek and visually appealing packaging, which has gained significant attention on TikTok with over 250 million views (!) for videos tagged with #laneigelipmask, likely contributes to their premium price point. It ultimately comes down to personal preference and budget when deciding whether the investment is worthwhile. While I don't make it a habit to purchase these on a regular basis, I do treat myself to one occasionally as a special indulgence - and I urge you to do so, too. Where Are Laneige's New Lip Sleeping Masks Available? Laneige's new Lip Sleeping Masks are available direct-to-consumer from the brand's website, as well as at Amazon and Sephora.

    "title": "Why I Regret Getting Microbladed Eyebrows as a Latina Millennial",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/latina-regrets-getting-eyebrows-microbladed-49398145",
    "description": "Image Source: Getty/isayildiz From a young age, Latina girls and young women are bombarded with ideas of what womanhood should look like. Part of this includes the pressure to uphold societal beauty standards that are often impossible to meet. These very standards still align with what is imposed by white supremacy. From the pressure for AfroLatinas to chemically straighten their hair to the push for all Latinas to have curvaceous yet thin bodies, being Latina means striving for desirability. Other standards that define beauty in our communities include having plump lips, light skin, and long, dark, flowy hair. This means that when one has a feature that doesn't fit this standard, it becomes easy to grow an insecurity around it. For me, it was several things, including something seemingly small yet significant: eyebrows. I have always had naturally thin eyebrows with not much hair (still do). From a young age, even when wearing makeup wasn't encouraged for girls, my mother did encourage me to paint my eyebrows like she would do herself. As a Latina, eyebrows are kind of huge for us. Some of the women who were lauded as beautiful and praised for meeting the \"Latina beauty standards\" had big, bushy eyebrows, from Salma Hayek and Gina Torres to Zoe Saldaña. While eyebrows weren't huge in Dominican culture specifically, we were still affected by representations of Latinidad seen in Hollywood. Salma Hayek for example, also played Minerva Mirabal, a Dominican shero, in the film adaptation of Julia Alvarez's book \"In the Time of the Butterflies,\" despite not being Dominican herself. With time, I became insecure, especially as I looked up to feminist icons like Frida Kahlo whose eyebrows were a big part of claiming their pride. These views of Latinidad that were alive during my teenage years were limiting, as they not only imposed harmful beauty standards, but they also painted us all with broad strokes when Latinidad is incredibly diverse. Years later, I was able to deconstruct a lot of these colonial notions, but I failed to realize that eyebrows were a blind spot for me: I was still insecure and never took a moment to understand the root of this insecurity. This is how these harmful beliefs become internalized. So, last year, when the idea of getting my eyebrows microbladed came up, I was excited. I was experiencing changes in my life, from a shift in my career to a change in family dynamics, and I felt that how I looked was something I could control. I found a trusted microblader who used natural, vegetable-based tint. When I first got them done, I felt refreshed and in love with my new look. As time went on, I realized something had changed. I no longer felt as beautiful in photos. I started feeling self-conscious when looking at photos, and this, coupled with natural aging (I was about to turn 33) made me feel different, like a certain softness was gone. I quickly realized that it was the procedure that had changed something in my face and changed my overall look. It took me some time to notice and get used to it. Women who get a lot of fillers have begun to share that they often face this experience, as little by little, the changes become very apparent. Over recent years, microblading is having the same fate, as more women are coming to regret the procedure. Now, over a year later, I have begun speeding up the process for fading the tint, hoping I can get it done naturally. Microblading is a semi-permanent procedure that should fade after a few years. I have used oils and even risky measures like trying to lighten them with hair-lightening products. Still, some people who have gotten microblading say the tint never truly fades, so I'm considering laser removal. Eyebrows Before Microblading Image Source: Amanda Alcántara Eyebrows After Microblading Image Source: Amanda Alcántara Eyebrows Currently Image Source: Amanda Alcántara The procedure, while initially appealing, often leads to dissatisfaction as the results can feel unnatural or too permanent. With time, the ink might even begin to change colors. This regret is compounded by the realization that beauty standards are constantly changing, and what is trendy today may not be tomorrow. What has helped me overcome regret has been acceptance. However, acceptance takes time and is a process on its own. It became evident to me that this is something I needed to embrace, similar to when I started feeling self-conscious about some fine lines and wrinkles I'm getting around my eyes. I had a moment of enlightenment, realizing that this is all a product of the passage of time, and it's part of the process of becoming wiser and more confident in who I am. Embracing the passage of time allowed me to realize that my microbladed eyebrows are also part of my story. If I approach myself with compassion, then I can say, \"My eyebrows are this way because I used to be self-conscious about them before, and that's part of my story.\" Therefore, I can embrace these microblades now. I can allow myself to patiently make the decision of what next steps I will take, whether that is to continue allowing it to fade naturally or perhaps getting laser removal down the line if they don't fade at all. Recently, through this acceptance, I also cut my hair in order to embrace my natural beauty and start a new chapter of self-love, and the change has been refreshing. Ultimately, I've learned to love my eyebrows anew. Even with the microblading, I've accepted myself and the choices I've made. This experience has taught me the importance of self-acceptance and the need to challenge unrealistic beauty standards. It has also allowed me compassion in the face of perfectionism when it comes to feeling like we need to be perfect deconstructed beings - we are not. And the images around me still impact me, which is why the process of unlearning is a daily practice.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/unsexy-beauty-products-49362561",
    "description": "There's a new trend sweeping Beauty TikTok where users reveal the \"unsexy\" beauty products in their routines that work like a charm. From body oils to tongue scrapers and everything in between, people are raiding their bathroom shelves to talk about all of the items they swear by but wouldn't necessarily take a shelfie of. These items are effective and get the job done - they just don't have the cutest packaging or Instagrammable results. As editors, we get to try products that run the gamut from dirt cheap to extremely expensive. Due to the nature of our roles, it's our duty to try everything with a neutral lens and report back on whether they work. While we love aesthetically pleasing bottles and pretty formulas that make us want to snap a picture, sometimes the best products are the ones that just work – sans any other bells and whistles. What's \"unsexy\" about a product can mean different things to different people. For some, it's the packaging that it comes in; for others, it can be what the item is used for. Still, the unifying quality of all of these items is that they deliver incredible results regardless of all that. As such, we've decided to share our favorite unsexy beauty products that we can't live without and would recommend in a heartbeat. Our obsessions range from products like Aquaphor Healing Ointment to First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - there are truly all kinds of options. From deodorant to dandruff shampoo, keep reading for the items we always keep in stock (and hidden within our medicine cabinets).",

    "title": "Revlon's Viral Blow-Dry Brush Is on Sale Right Now - Here's Why We Love It",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/revlon-one-step-hair-dryer-volumizer-plus-review-48638494",
    "description": "When I think about beauty tools that have gone viral, the first product that comes to mind is Revlon's One-Step Hair Dryer and Volumizer. Not only does it have more than 360,000 five-star reviews on Amazon, but I honestly can't scroll my TikTok feed without seeing at least one person using this fan-favorite blow-dryer brush. It's easy to see why: not only is it affordable, but it's helped countless people achieve salon-worthy blowouts from the comfort of their own homes. Although this product has amassed what can only be described as a cult following, users still had suggestions for improvement. Revlon's response? The One-Step Volumizer Plus ($37, originally $70). I tried out the older version of Revlon's blow-dryer brush, but the brush head was a little too big for me and made it difficult to nail down my go-to style. Also, I didn't love the heat settings because it felt like the high heat was too much for my hair, but the low setting was too low to set the style I was looking to achieve. In the end, it left my hair feeling a little dry and dehydrated, so I opted to use a different tool for my at-home blowouts. However, my best friend uses the older version of Revlon's blow-dry brush and swears by it, so when I heard about the improvements and the smaller brush attachment on the newest version, I decided it was time to give the blow-dry brush a second chance. After I started seeing glowing reviews for the newer version on TikTok I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. When I received it in the mail, I eagerly awaited wash day so I could finally test it out - spoiler alert, it was everything I wanted and more. Right now it's on major sale for Amazon's October Prime Day - we're talking 47 percent off - but if you're interested in grabbing it, make sure you get it before the sale ends Oct. 9. Keep reading for everything you need to know about the Revolon brush blow dryer, as well as my before and after photos. About the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus Blow-Dryer Brush The most recent tool has ceramic-titanium tourmaline technology, which helps reduce heat damage and protect hair against it. It has low, medium, high, and cool heat settings for easy customization. (The previous version only had low, high, and cool.) While the original version had a 4.25-inch oval brush, the newest version comes with a 2.4-inch oval brush. The brush head is detachable for easy storing and traveling. What I Like About the Revlon Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus Blow-Dryer Brush The biggest difference I noticed between this brush and others I've used in the past is how well my hairstyle stayed put. Although I think I've pretty much mastered the '90s blowout, I've often found that the look can fall throughout the day if I don't use a ton of hairspray or texture spray. I didn't use either after the Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer, and my flipped-in ends lasted even after a night of sleeping on them. While my hair sometimes felt dry when using the older version of this blow-dryer brush, my experience with the newer version was the opposite: it was smooth and shiny. How to Use the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus Blow-Dryer Brush When wash day finally arrived, I prepped my damp, clean hair with a leave-in conditioner, hair oil, and a heat protectant. I then waited until my hair was about 85 percent dry, and I separated it into sections. I started out by running the brush through my ends, then curled and flipped the hair under. I repeated those steps for the middle and top sections, and in the end, I was left with a perfect blowout. What to Consider Before Trying the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus Blow-Dryer Brush My only wish is that this tool had an option for different attachments, but with the detachable head as a brand-new feature, who knows what Revlon has in store for the future. Still, if you're looking for an affordable way to achieve a salon-worthy blowout without ever stepping foot outside of your house, either add Revlon's One-Step Hair Dryer to your cart or add it to your wish list ASAP. Where the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus Blow-Dryer Brush Is Available The Revlon Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus is available on Amazon and Target.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/loccitane-cleansing-softening-almond-shower-oil-review-49398826",
    "description": "Don't tell my lotion-obsessed sisters, but I skipped way too many days of moisturizing my body over the summer. I find the routine of lathering on body oil, cream, or body butter on my skin post-shower to be tedious - an added step that takes time away from something else I could be doing. As you probably guessed, a season full of skin-baring outfits without hydration has left me with parched, itchy skin. I've been looking for a solution to minimize the itchiness and dry appearance that doesn't require weeks of applying lotion. The L'Occitane Cleansing \u0026 Softening Almond Shower Oil ($23, originally $29) has garnered the nod of approval from many beauty editors and has five beauty awards from various magazines at time of posting, so I decided to test it out. Spoiler alert: I was instantly hooked. Keep reading for more details about the shower oil and why it's become my new favorite multitasking hydration product. Plus, right now it's on sale for Amazon's October Prime Day, so make sure you snag it at a discount while it's still in stock - the sale ends Oct. 9. About the L'Occitane Cleansing \u0026 Softening Almond Shower Oil It's a two-in-one shower oil that cleanses dirt and impurities while deeply hydrating the skin and giving it a radiant glow. The oil-to-milky formula can be used all over the body to soften skin. Its formula includes sweet almond oil, grapeseed oil, vitamin E \u0026 Beta-sitosterol, omega 9 and 6 fatty acids, and squalene. Regular use is said to turn skin firmer and smoother, according to the brand. What I Like About the L'Occitane Cleansing \u0026 Softening Almond Shower Oil The brand claims one bottle of this product sells every 10 seconds worldwide. It's packed with sweet almond oil and grapeseed oil, and after using it for less than a week, I can truly tell why it's so popular. Unlike traditional body washes, this shower oil foams to clean off the day, producing a sweet (and not super overpowering) fragrance that leaves my skin the smoothest it's ever been from a shower wash. Before I even step out of the shower I notice that my skin looks and feels more hydrated. The brand attributes this to the almond oil that is known to moisturize skin, protect it from sun damage, and improve texture; and grapeseed oil that is high in linoleic acid which increases the skin's moisture and softness. Being able to use the two-in-one product in lieu of a post-cleansing lotion has completely streamlined my body-care routine. I no longer have to set aside time to spritz on body oil, wait for it to dry, and then follow up with a lotion. The L'Occitane Cleansing \u0026 Softening Almond Shower Oil takes care of all these steps for me with its deeply moisturizing ingredients. Plus, the freshly baked Parisian-almond croissant aroma pleasantly lingers on my skin for up to an hour. Testing products is a huge part of my job as a beauty editor. And while so many hydrating body products claim to keep the skin moisturized all day long, few actually do. But with this shower oil, I've found myself caressing my arms (my biggest dry skin problem area) throughout the day, in awe of their softness. How to Use the L'Occitane Cleansing \u0026 Softening Almond Shower Oil The luxurious formula emulsifies into a hydrating, velvety milky foam that easily lathers onto any cleansing tool of choice. It's meant to be used on wet skin while in the shower. In testing it over the course of four days, I've tried applying it with a loofah, washcloth, and mini exfoliating gloves. Each time it's produced a really beautiful scent that lathers perfectly when it comes into contact with water. Even though it's an oil, this formula is non-greasy and won't leave a sticky residue. Word to the wise though, a little bit goes a long way. I tend to add just two to three dollops to my loofah and scrub away the dirt from head to toe for consistent, silky-smooth results. What to Consider Before Trying the L'Occitane Cleansing \u0026 Softening Almond Shower Oil The almond shower oil has a beautifully subtle scent to it. However, if you are sensitive to fragrance, this might not be the product for you. Purchasing it repeatedly also may be an expensive habit to pick up, given that it's priced at $29 for just 8.4 fluid ounces. But it's important to note that if you use just a couple of drops per wash, the oil should last for a few weeks. Where Is the L'Occitane Cleansing \u0026 Softening Almond Shower Oil Available? You can get the L'Occitane Cleansing \u0026 Softening Almond Shower Oil at Amazon, L'Occitane, Sephora, Nordstrom, Ulta Beauty, and Anthropologie.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/color-wow-raise-root-spray-review-49060256",
    "description": "I don't care what anyone says, TikTok is a treasure. Over the years, the app has introduced me to new ways to wear my hair in a claw clip, a blush makeup hack that made my life infinitely easier, and new relationship advice. What more could someone want? I'm constantly scrolling for beauty tips, especially when it comes to my hair. I have fine hair, and it can look exceptionally flat at the roots when it's dirty. Plus, I only wash it twice a week, so it's actually dirty more often than it's clean. When I saw a video from TikTok user Kaelyn Emily showcasing how a root-thickening spray gave her dirty hair new life, I knew I had to test it out for myself. So, does the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray ($17, originally $24) live up to the hype? Spoiler alert: it does, and it's worth hitting the \"add to cart button,\" especially while it's currently on sale during Amazon's October Prime Day. However, act fast, because the sale ends Oct. 9. Keep scrolling to read my full review and see before and after photos. About the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray This liquid formula is made with proprietary elastomers that promise to add volume to the roots of the hair. It can be applied wet or dry and works for all hair types, but it's ideal for thin, fine, or limp hair. It also doubles as a heat protectant, and it's paraben, sulfate, and gluten-free. @kaetheblondie Wait whatttttttt #hairstylistlife #hairstylistsoftiktok #volume #hairtok #flathair #hairhack #hairtips ♬ original sound - Kae What I Like About the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray I've used this product quite a few times since my first trial, and it's become one of my go-to tools for giving my hair volume. Now that I know it works well on dirty and dry hair, it's practically replaced my need for dry shampoo entirely. I've also used it on damp, clean hair, and it's my favorite product for making sure my volume lasts all night long. It doesn't leave behind any stickiness, and there's no visible residue that I often see when using dry shampoos. How to Use the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray The brand recommends applying the product to damp or dry hair, concentrating on the roots, and then styling as desired. In the video I saw on TikTok, the woman applied the product to dirty hair, which is how I initially decided to test it out. I was on day four of not washing, so I wasn't entirely sure whether or not it would work for me as well as it had for her. To try it out, I started out by sectioning off the top of my hair and spraying a generous amount of the product in each section. Then, I took my Dyson Airwrap dryer attachment and soaked up some of the excess product. From there, I took the Dyson round brush attachment and began blowdrying and styling. When I was finished getting everything smooth and dry, I was shocked to see that my hair not only had tons of volume at the roots but also looked like it had been freshly washed. What to Consider Before Trying the ColorWow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray One thing to note about this product is that, unlike dry shampoo, it does require the extra step of styling with a blow dryer or dryer brush. If you're someone who likes a quick fix, this might not be the product for you. However, I think the extra step is worth it based on the results. Also, I have noticed that the product can smell a little bit like alcohol when you first apply it, and although it quickly fades, it can be a little off-putting at first. Where Is the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray Available? The Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray is available on Amazon, as well as the brand's website and Sephora.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Cosrx-Advanced-Snail-96-Mucin-Power-Essence-Review-46422012",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Kelsey Garcia My skin-care inspiration is that of a glazed doughnut. I dream of having hydrated, dewy, and near-reflective skin, and I'm happy to report that a recent purchase has brought me closer than ever to my goal: the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ($13, originally $25). I'm by no means the first person to rave about this beauty product. In fact, the essence already has quite the cult following. (A facial essence, by the way, is a concentrated yet lightweight lotion applied after cleanser but before moisturizer.) This particular one by Cosrx claims to hydrate the skin and even out its texture, all the while minimizing fine lines and acne scars. So, yeah, it's promising a lot. The secret to the product's success is snail mucin, an ingredient that's been appearing in more widely available skin-care products in the last few years. It's believed that the mucin naturally possesses moisturizing ingredients like hyaluronic acid and glycolic acid, to name a few. Some studies have also shown that it can reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles, according to research published in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology. And as far as I'm concerned, it's a must-have for everyone. Right now it's heavily discounted for Amazon's October Prime Day, so make sure you stock up while it's still available, because the sale ends soon. Keep reading to learn more about the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence. About the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence Key ingredients include snail secretion filtrate (a substance derived from snails and beloved for its hydrating benefits), soothing allantoin, and hydrating hyaluronic acid. It's highly rated on retailer sites like Amazon, with nearly 75,000 five-star ratings. It doesn't contain any fragrance, sulfates, or parabens. What I Like About the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence I'll admit, I bought this essence before I knew anything about what it really was or snail mucin benefits. Instead, I simply kept seeing mentions of the product across the internet, recognized that it was fairly affordable and - since I'm gullible - that's really all it took. So off I went to oo35mm, a local beauty shop frequented by skin-care connoisseurs, in search of a bottle of the stuff. Because I am in my late 20s and own a smartphone, I posted a photo of my purchases on Instagram Stories. I kid you not, no selfie I have ever posted has received such engagement. (Frankly, I should have been offended.) Some people inquired about the whole snail situation, but most of the people who replied said they were longtime fans of the essence. There were a lot of flame emojis involved. It's been months since I started using the essence daily. I use it after cleansing and before applying moisturizer, and I am a complete convert. Though I was worried the additional skin-care step would clog my pores over time, leading to pimples and what have you, my skin's texture has actually improved, and it feels way more even now. The hydration payoff is also huge, and I feel like it actually helps my moisturizer work better, too. For a while, I had been feeling as though the cream would just sit atop my skin after application, and now I feel like it's actually penetrating through and sinking in. Best of all, I finally feel close to glazed doughnut status. Image Source: Amazon What to Consider Before Trying the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence One thing to consider before trying the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence is that the texture isn't for everyone. To me, it feels sticky just for a few seconds before absorbing into my skin completely. This fleeting stickiness, though brief, has deterred some users. It's worth noting: the majority of shoppers agree that it ultimately doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky, and as far as I'm concerned, that shopper was being a tad dramatic. Nonetheless, if that initial texture will throw you for a loop, you might want to consider a different product. Where Is the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence Available? The Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence is available at Amazon and Ulta Beauty.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/hero-cosmetics-mighty-patch-original-review-49316247",
    "description": "I've been fortunate enough to have relatively clear skin for most of my life, but every now and then, there are those pesky pimples that pop up at the most random and unwanted times. Sometimes, it can be due to stress or simply a sign that a change in my skin-care routine is needed. Either way, I typically try to get rid of them as fast as possible with a spot treatment. However, recently, I've been even more successful at eliminating breakouts with the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch The Original ($16, originally $22). As someone with sensitive skin, I'm not the first to jump at just any new product. But that doesn't mean I'm not tempted by the idea of something that promises to get rid of acne in just a few hours. After finally giving the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch a chance, I was thrilled to learn that my easily irritated skin loves it. It helped eliminate my pimples overnight. Keep reading for my full review of the acne patch (which, by the way, happens to be on sale for Amazon Prime Day, but act fast because the sale ends Oct. 9). About the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch The Original Made of pure, medical-grade hydrocolloid, this sticker improves the look of pimples overnight. It's a chemical-free formula and allergy-tested to be suitable for all skin types. You typically see results in six to eight hours. The sheet's translucent matte finish blends well into the skin. Included in a box are 36 patches. What I Like About the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch The Original From its unmatched staying power to the undeniable results, I can say that the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch truly lives up to the hype. Thanks to its gel formula, the patch gently clings to the skin for hours while effortlessly absorbing all of the gunk in the pimple. This is great, whether you're a heavy sleeper or on the go all day. It also helps you beat the annoying temptation of picking at your face, which helps prevent scabs and scarring caused by popping pimples. The patches come in 36-count and 72-count packages. How to Use the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch The Original The Mighty Patch is incredibly simple to use. Whether you're going to sleep or just starting your day, prep your skin with your usual cleansing routine. You can apply toner as well, but be careful with your moisturizer as the area around the pimple needs to be dry and any oils will keep it from adhering properly. Then, you just stick the patch on, let it sit for six to eight hours, and peel it off when it turns white. And just like that, you're left with a noticeably smaller breakout and in some cases, it fully disappears. What to Consider Before Trying the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch The Original This acne patch is an excellent option for all skin types, including those with sensitive skin like myself. However, the brand recommends using caution if you're prone to irritation. Where Is the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch Original Available? The Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch Original is available on Amazon, as well as Target, Ulta Beauty, and the brand's website.

    "title": "Grab These Bestselling Crest Whitestrips While They're on Sale",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/crest-whitestrips-review-49221813",
    "description": "In the lead-up to my wedding, there are several beauty treatments I've either already outsourced or plan to indulge in before the big day. From acrylic nails to a natural-looking spray tan and even laser hair removal, there's no doubt I'm holding back. However, there was one treatment I couldn't bring myself to undergo professionally: teeth whitening. The intense post-treatment discomfort during my first attempt years ago left me determined to explore other options. So, here I am now, typing this with my top and bottom teeth sandwiched in Crest 3D Whitestrips ($30, originally $46) opting for an at-home solution that suits me better. While experiences vary, this is officially my chosen method to achieve a brighter smile, and I plan on stocking up since they're currently on sale for Amazon's October Prime Day, which ends Oct. 9. Ahead, I break down more details about them. Keep reading for my full review and to see my before-and-after photos. About Crest 3D Whitestrips Crest Whitestrips have been around since 2001. It comes with a total of 44 strips (22 upper and 22 lower): 20 Professional Effects Treatments and two One-Hour Express Treatments. The American Dental Association (ADA) Crest 3D Whitestrips recognizes Crest Whitestrips as a safe and effective method for teeth whitening. For best results, the brand recommends using them once a day for 30 minutes. What I Like About Crest 3D Whitestrips What truly impresses me about Crest 3D Whitestrips is how effective they are. Even though it had been well over a decade since I last used them, I couldn't resist trying them again and added them to my virtual Amazon shopping cart. The box boldly claimed they could \"remove over 15 years of stains in three days,\" which initially made me a bit skeptical. However, the results speak for themselves. Crest 3D Whitestrips Before and After After just four treatments, the difference is already remarkable. The \"before\" image on the left and the \"after\" image on the right clearly shows the noticeable change. And I've barely made a dent in the box with plenty of treatments left. How to Use Crest 3D Whitestrips Using Crest 3D Whitestrips is a straightforward process. Within a box containing 20 treatments, each strip is individually wrapped for convenience, which makes them travel-friendly. To use them, you simply peel open the packaging using the tear notch and then place the longer strip on the front of your upper teeth and the shorter strip on your lower teeth. As you do this, try to aim to align the straight edge of the strip with your gumline and then fold over the back side of your teeth to secure it in place. Leave the strips on for 30 minutes, and then remove them. I always brush my teeth afterward to get rid of the peroxide taste, but that's ultimately a personal preference. It's important to note that perfecting the application process may require some trial and error. I found that the grippy texture of the whitening strips worked really well on my top teeth but not as effectively on my bottom teeth. Toward the end of the 30 minutes, I noticed that the bottom strip tended to slide off, resulting in a gap in coverage. Similar experiences have been shared by other shoppers. One satisfied Amazon customer, who rated them five stars and considered them worth the money, mentioned that \"the bottom strips seemed to not stick properly but other than that they work FANTASTICALLY!!\" Another equally impressed shopper agreed, stating, \"I found the bottom is a bit harder to stay on, but other than that, they work well!\" What to Consider Before Trying Teeth Whitening Strips Before trying teeth whitening strips, it's important to be aware of the potential for irritation. I experienced soreness and had to take a Tylenol to alleviate the sensitivity, which persisted throughout the day. As a result, I decided to skip a day to avoid dealing with the discomfort again. However, when I resumed using them, I didn't experience any pain and have been using them nightly ever since. When deciding on a teeth whitening method, it's essential to consider if whitening strips are the best fit for you. As someone who values the convenience of whitening my teeth at home, saving money, and being able to multitask, the strips have become my preferred option over professional treatments. However, it's important to acknowledge that there are alternative options available, such as toothpastes and gels that can be directly applied to your teeth or via a tray that fits in your mouth. According to the American Dental Association (ADA), in-office teeth whitening treatments may have stronger effects, which aligns with my experience of feeling significant discomfort afterward. The ADA states: \"Bleaching compounds in over-the-counter whitening products are typically peroxide-based and contain carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide at lower concentrations compared to in-office or dentist-prescribed, at-home bleaching techniques.\" Nonetheless, I'm cool with sticking with my whitestrips, especially since the results are top-notch. And finally, Crest recommends a few maintenance tips to get the most out of your whitestrips. \"If you drink cola drinks, sip them through a straw to minimize the contact of the drink with your white teeth,\" the brand states on its website. Likewise, they advise you \"rinse your mouth as soon as possible to minimize the risk of stains if you drink coffee, tea, red wine, or cola, or eat foods that are likely to stain your white teeth.\" As an avid coffee drinker, I've been making a point to rinse with Crest Whitening Rinse Fresh Mint Mouthwash ($26) after getting my coffee fix.

    "title": "Hair Extensions 101: Everything You Should Know From Experts",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/hair-extensions-48959472",
    "description": "Whether you have thin hair that you're looking to bulk up, short hair that you want to lengthen, or are just in the mood to switch up your hairstyle without the commitment of a more permanent change, hair extensions are a great choice. The topic of hair extensions is vast and complex. There are a variety of different types of hair extensions - like hand-tied extensions, microlinks hair extensions, tape-in extensions, clip-in hair extensions, and halo hair extensions, to name just a few - and each kind has its own list of perks and drawbacks. Aside from the cost, you'll also want to know how to properly care for your hair extensions and how long they'll last before committing. If you're considering trying hair extensions for thin hair for the first time, we're sharing everything you need to know so you can find the best hair extensions for your needs with the help of four experts below. They help us break down the cost of hair extensions as well as all of the different types. Keep scrolling to learn more. Experts Featured in This Article Louise Bailey is the founder of Hair Extensions London. Julia Venturin is a hair-extension expert at Luxy Hair. Tatiana Karelina is the owner of Russian hair-extensions company Tatiana Karelina. Brynn Reed is the lead extension specialist at Mirror Mirror Salon. Types of Hair Extensions \"There are many different hair types and application methods available, so you can experiment until you find the perfect look for you at a price point that suits your budget,\" Louise Bailey, founder of Hair Extensions London, tells PS. Before we get into the different application types, let's go over the two main categories of hair extensions: real human hair extensions and synthetic hair extensions. \"Human hair extensions are exactly what they sound like - they are made out of real, human hair from top to bottom, collected from a donor,\" says Julia Venturin, a hair-extension expert at Luxy Hair. \"Remy hair means all the cuticles (the outer layer of the hair) are intact, running in the same direction at the time of collection. This allows for almost no tangling and ensures that the extensions remain smooth and silky throughout their lifetime.\" Synthetic hair extensions, on the other hand, are made out of various synthetic, blended fibers - no human hair. \"These fibers are usually very fine, plastic fibers that are manufactured to imitate real human hair,\" Venturin says. Here, we're breaking down a few of the most common types of extensions. Clip-In Hair Extensions View this post on Instagram A post shared by KnappyHair by Keandra Janelle (@knappyhair) Clip-ins are perhaps the easiest, least time-consuming way of adding length, thickness, and volume to your hair, and one of the best things about them is that you don't even have to see a professional to have them installed. \"The good, quality clip-ins will look and feel natural, they will last years, there is no commitment, and you can fit and style them yourself,\" says Tatiana Karelina, owner of Russian hair-extensions company Tatiana Karelina. These types of extensions clip to your hair, and they come in handy when you want to change up your hair for a particular event or occurrence and don't want to commit to something more permanent. (You typically take them out after a day but can continue to reuse them for long after that.) Nowadays, clip-ins come in all kinds of lengths, textures, and colors, and you can usually buy them in packs. For an editor-approved option, read our full review of Bellami hair extensions; the brand has plenty of weft hair extension options. Tape-In Hair Extensions View this post on Instagram A post shared by Extensionaire Luxury Hair Extensions (@extensionaire) Tape-ins are considered semipermanent extensions; they're similar to clip-ins except that they can last longer and are taped to your hair. They're also pretty weightless, so you don't feel weighed down even if you're wearing a head full of them. \"Tape-ins are applied by a professional and can last for two months before needing maintenance,\" says Bailey. \"The hair is reusable with this method.\" Microlink Hair Extensions View this post on Instagram A post shared by Microlinks | TapeIns | ClipIns (@perfectdistractionhairgallery) Microlinks - also called microrings or microbeads - are a popular alternative option to sew-in weaves and tape-in extensions. These are normally attached to strands of hair using small tubes or rings, and they are said to be safer than other kinds of extensions because they don't damage the hair and scalp by putting too much weight or stress on them. They also don't require the use of glue or adhesive, making them a lot less noticeable in your hair. One downside, depending on how you look at it, is that getting a full head of microlink hair extensions can take anywhere from one to five hours to complete, but they can last up to two to three months. Sew-In Weaves View this post on Instagram A post shared by Taniyah 🤍 (@taniyahslayedyoullc) Installing a weave is a process that requires a bit more labor. They're usually installed by a hairstylist who braids the hair down into a specific pattern - either what's known as a beehive or straight-back cornrows - before sewing bundles or \"tracks\" down to the braids. This can usually take anywhere from two to six hours, depending on how many bundles you're installing (two or three is a good amount) and how speedy your stylist is. Weaves can last anywhere from six to 10 weeks, though it's important for people who wear them to also make sure they're still regularly taking care of their hair that's beneath the weave. Keratin Bond/Pre-Bonded Hair Extensions View this post on Instagram A post shared by Great Lengths Hair Extensions (@greatlengthsusa) Keratin extensions are also known as k-tip extensions. Bonds are fused to the hair using keratin and a heat gun. This process can take a few hours to complete since, like microlinks, each extension is connected to your natural hair individually until the desired look has been achieved. These aren't permanent, but they do last up to four or five months, depending on personal maintenance. UV Hair Extensions @lachunsoftlife #hairloss #alopecia #fyp #hairextensions #atlantahairstylist #onthisday #coldfusionhairextensions #softlife ♬ original sound - Luxury extensions LED or UV hair extensions are touted as the most seamless extension technique to date. To get the look, single strands of hair will be bonded onto your natural pieces of hair, using a special glue that will then be cured with a UV light to keep everything in place. How long the process takes depends on how large the area that you're working with is, and the results last for about six weeks. The cost is usually about $250 per session and approximately $1200 for your entire head. Halo Hair Extensions If you're looking for a quick and easy way to add length to your hair, you might want to consider Halo hair extensions. The extensions use a thin wire to secure the hair around the crown of your head, and your natural hair goes over it. They're easy to put on and take out, which makes them perfect if you want to add a little extra length and thickness for a special event. There are a few different brands that make this type of hair extension, like Zala Hair Extensions and Luxy. Read our full Luxy Halo Hair Extensions review. Do Hair Extensions Damage Your Natural Hair? Sadly, there's a lot of misinformation out there about hair extensions, including that they will damage your natural hair. In fact, this notion is mostly false. Bailey explains that when applied by a professional and cared for properly, damage is not likely. \"If you're considering getting hair extensions, it's important to do your research and consult with a hair-extensions expert to ensure that they're right for you and the correct hair type and product is used,\" she says. How to Care For Hair Extensions Hair extensions require special care. The better you care for them, the more use you'll get out of them. The number-one rule of handling hair extensions is to be gentle. \"Brush them gently with a soft-bristled brush, and avoid using harsh chemicals or too much heat,\" says Bailey. Venturin adds: \"The more you wash and heat style your extensions, the shorter their lifespan will be, so try to keep the washing and product use to a minimum.\" Nonsynthetic extensions can and should be washed just like the hair on your head. This helps prevent product, dirt, and oil buildup on the hair. \"Use a mild shampoo and conditioner, keeping conditioners away from the attachment points,\" says Bailey. However, just as you don't want to overwash your own hair, try to avoid washing your extensions too much. \"Unlike your own hair, which receives natural hydration from the oils on your scalp, hair extensions don't have a natural hydration source,\" says Venturin. \"Therefore, keeping them hydrated is key to keeping them shiny and in good condition.\" Cost of Hair Extensions If you're wondering, how much do hair extensions cost? That's a hard question to answer due to the many different types of hair extensions available on the market - hair extension prices are based on the hair you choose, as well as who installs it. \"High-quality, hand-tied hair extensions will look more natural and last longer than synthetic extensions but require a higher cost to purchase and install,\" says Brynn Reed, the lead extension specialist at Mirror Mirror Salon. Quality extensions made from human hair, such as clip-ins, typically range from $100 to $350, while more \"permanent,\" long-wearing extensions that are professionally installed can cost $350 to upward of $2,000. Synthetic hair extensions, on the other hand, are far cheaper. Things to Keep in Mind When Getting Hair Extensions There are many benefits to extensions, but you should consider your current hair routine to determine if they're right for you. \"Extensions are not a wash-and-go style,\" says Reed. \"They must be blow-dried. Leaving extensions wet for prolonged periods causes the wefts to break down and shortens the lifespan of your extensions. If you commit to extensions, you commit to the blow-out.\" Additionally, the haircut you have matters. Extensions are able to add volume and length to your existing style, but in order for the final result to look seamless, you'll want to avoid any blunt-style haircuts. \"This makes the job so much harder to blend,\" says Bailey.

    "description": "Whenever Taylor Swift attends a Kansas City Chiefs game to support her boyfriend, football tight end Travis Kelce, all eyes are on her: what will she wear? Will she keep her signature red lipstick or try a new hue? What A-lister friends will she bring with her in the box? At the game on Oct. 7 against the New Orleans Saints, the singer arrived at the stadium wearing a gray and red plaid, off-the-shoulder mini dress, a flirty high ponytail, and glitter freckles that now have everyone clamoring to learn how to recreate them. Swift's glitter freckles included dots of silver and red sprawled across her nose and cheeks, which complemented her red lipstick and cat eyeliner. The unexpected yet perfectly executed beauty detail was the cherry on top of her entire look. Anyone who's ever attempted faux freckles knows the application process can be a bit tedious, but Swift had a little help from a small business called Fazit Beauty. The brand makes freckle patches that come in sheets and act as a temporary tattoo for your face, saving you time on painstakingly applying each freckle. For Swift's glitter freckles, it appears she used the Fazit Silver Glitter Freckles Makeup Patches ($16), which also come in gold. Fazit's founder, Aliett Butts, explained in a TikTok video that she sent Swift's makeup artist, Lorrie Turk, a few patches in the spring of 2023 in hopes of getting the brand on the star's radar, but she didn't know if it would happen. Now, months later, it seems to have worked. Ahead, see another photo of Swift's glitter freckles and head over to Fazit's website to get yours - we have a feeling these are going to be everywhere this football season.

    "title": "I Tried a \"Jaw Bra,\" and the Results Were Undeniable",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/jaw-bra-editor-experiment-48978632",
    "description": "Over the last few months, I've been seeing \"jaw bras\" and \"face bras\" all over social media. For the unfamiliar, these products are face masks worn on the underside of the chin and jaw that hook over the ears. Most of these masks claim to tighten skin and eliminate double chins, which is something I'm definitely interested in. I'm still too scared to try anything even marginally invasive like plastic surgery or Botox, so I decided to hop on the face-bra bandwagon and try one for myself. The jaw bra that I tested out is the Wishful Chin Lift Peptide and Niacinamide Sculpting Sheet Mask ($9). The product is formulated with ingredients like peppermint and niacinamide to soothe inflammation and improve the appearance of textured skin. Unlike traditional sheet masks made from microfiber or cotton, this product is made from a woven cotton material that is typically used for athletic tape. Experts Featured in This Article Edward Chamata, MD, is a plastic surgeon based in Texas who specializes in aesthetic surgery for the face, breasts, and body. Konstantin Vasyukevich, MD, is a facial plastic surgeon based in New York City, best known for face lift surgery. To try it out, I started by washing and drying my face. The directions stated to apply the product on a clean, dry face, so I skipped my skin-care routine and went straight for the mask. After taking it out of the package and peeling off the protective film, I stretched it out a tiny bit by pulling on either end to ensure it wasn't too tight. I placed the middle of the mask directly on my chin and pulled upward on each side until I had secured each side around my ears. I then set a timer for 30 minutes and let the mask do its thing. The mask felt a little uncomfortable while I was wearing it, but mostly, my chin and jaw just felt securely held in place. I could still move my neck and head around easily, and although it looked a bit funny, it wasn't too difficult to wear for half an hour. For me, the worst part was the area where the mask hooked over my ears. It felt similar to wearing an N-95 mask on my face, except it was a lot heavier and tighter and left my ears feeling sore around the 20-minute mark. When I took the mask off to inspect the results, I was genuinely shocked to see that my chin and jaw looked slimmer. I compared my before and after photos, and the difference was instantly visible. The skin underneath my chin looked flatter rather than puffy as it had before. Plus, not only did my face look slimmer, but the skin that was under the mask also felt hydrated and soft to the touch. Although the results from using the mask were distinct at first, after three hours, my chin went back to normal. This had me wondering how masks like this actually worked and whether they're a good long-term solution. How Do Jaw Bras Work? \"The likely mechanism by which these devices work is by adding compression to areas such as the under-chin region, which then temporarily decreases the amount of lymphatic fluid in that region,\" plastic surgeon Edward Chamata, MD, tells PS. \"This may create a temporary appearance of a more defined jawline since there's less fluid in that region due to compression.\" I was surprised to learn that there are some disadvantages to wearing these masks too frequently. \"The downside of using such devices could be the reduction in tone of the underlying muscles, which in turn would lead to more, not less, sagging,\" Konstantin Vasyukevich, MD, double board-certified plastic surgeon, says. If you're looking for permanent ways to shape your face and jawline, both Dr. Chamata and Dr. Vasyukevich agree that surgical intervention is usually necessary. Liposuction, buccal fat removal, and facelifts are common examples of procedures that would permanently change the face. However, for those looking for less invasive alternatives, Dr. Chamata suggests radio-frequency skin-tightening devices such as the celebrity-loved Morpheus8 or FaceTite, which can be performed in office without general anesthesia. Personally, I plan on continuing to use this mask ahead of big nights out or scenarios where I'm having my photo taken because the results are undeniable, and I'm still not quite ready to head down the plastic-surgery road just yet.

    "description": "There are a handful of reasons why someone might find themselves seeking a restorative breast tattoo: they might have had a double mastectomy, gender-confirming top surgery, a reconstruction surgery post-accident, and so on. After undergoing a breast reconstruction, getting an areola or nipple tattoo is often the final step in restoring the appearance of your chest. \"This service is most commonly offered to those who have undergone mastectomies due to breast cancer but can be helpful for anyone who has a need for it,\" tattoo artist Shaughnessy Otsuji tells PS. \"I work with trans men and women and nonbinary folks who have received top surgery or other chest reconstruction; clients who have burns, skin grafts, or other scarring that has affected their chest; as well as anyone who is unhappy with their natural nipples and may need reshaping or repigmentation.\" There are tattoo artists that specialize in restorative ink, such as Otsuji, ensuring that you get the most natural, realistic results. \"This type of tattooing is so emotional, yet so rewarding, and the most exciting as it yields instant results,\" she says. \"Something as visual as restoring nipples that have been previously removed is very impactful.\" Learn more about the process of getting an areola or nipple tattoo below. Experts Featured in This Article Shaughnessy Otsuji is the owner and a tattoo artist at Studio Sashiko. How Soon After Surgery Can You Get an Areola Tattoo? In the case of a mastectomy, it's generally recommended that you wait six to 12 months post-radiation and chemotherapy to undergo breast reconstruction. In all cases of chest surgery, the scar should be healed before booking an appointment for a tattoo. \"Scars should be completely healed and settled into the skin as much as possible before attempting to tattoo over them,\" Otsuji. At her studio, they ask clients to wait for a minimum of six months post-surgery. \"This wait time allows for necessary healing, scar maturation, and breast settlement to take place. Areola tattoos should be the final step in the reconstruction process.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by shaughnessy otsuji (@shaughnessy) What It's Like to Get a Nipple Tattoo Going to a tattoo artist who specializes in reconstructive tattooing will help you get the most realistic-looking results. \"Every areola tattoo is completely customized to the clients,\" says Otsuji. \"I strive to create the most realistic results by adding strategic details, highlights, shadows, and dimensions, and choosing a collection of colors that suits their skin best. The end result is an undetectable, realistic areola that looks like one they would have had naturally.\" Once you're ready to start the tattoo process, you'll have a consultation with your artist. \"During this consultation, we'll discuss the client's desired nipple size, placement, and pigment colors that complement their skin,\" says Otsuji. \"I'll also want to assess the client's skin type and any scar patterns or scar tissue that may require more technical skill to achieve the end result.\" From there, a custom areola design is made and applied to the chest, just like when you get a tattoo in others areas. With the stencil in place, a tattoo machine will be used to create the design on the skin. \"In most cases, the skin can be quite thin, scarred, and delicate after surgery so a gentle approach must be taken when tattooing this type of skin,\" says Otsuji. \"Any professional offering these types of services must be careful not to overwork the skin and to avoid causing more damage.\" In total, this can take anywhere from two to two and a half hours to complete. Keep in mind that \"it can sometimes take multiple sessions to achieve the most detailed and realistic results.\" Do Nipple Tattoos Hurt? A common question asked is if getting a restorative tattoo is painful. \"The majority of my clients experience loss of feeling in the area after their mastectomy due to tissue removal and nerve damage,\" says Otsuji. \"For those who still have some sensitivity, a topical anesthetic called Zensa is applied to numb the skin and keep the client relaxed.\" How Much Do Nipple Tattoos Cost? The price of this type of tattoo depends on the studio, as well as the amount of work needed. On average, Otsuji says her studio charges $500 to $700.
