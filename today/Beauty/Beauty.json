    "description": "Since its inception nine years ago, The Ordinary has come to define affordable, no-nonsense skincare. Firmly committed to ingredient transparency and reasonable pricing, the brand consistently delivers innovative products at a fraction of the cost you would normally pay elsewhere. It’s no wonder that each new launch and restock from the brand has become a highly anticipated event, with waitlists often stretching into the thousands (recent successes like the GF 15% Solution and Serum Foundation come to mind). Ahead, we’ve asked our community of beauty editors and experts to share their all-time favorite products from The Ordinary — the ones they’d gladly repurchase with their own money. Whether you’re a longtime fan or new to the brand, these are the standout heroes that deserve a spot on your bathroom shelf. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Ordinary GF 15% Solution, $15.50 “I maintain that this serum ended my Botox obsession. Hear me out: the star ingredients are growth factors — a type of peptide or protein known to kickstart and encourage skin cell growth over time. Besides being used to heal wounds, they have another major skincare benefit: boosting collagen and elastin, the two things that make skin plump. Collagen-rich skin shows fewer fine lines and wrinkles. Don’t get me wrong — those are totally natural and a normal part of aging, but I suspect mine are down to my own doing, thanks to too much sun exposure when I was younger, not to mention dehydration. (I’m terrible at drinking water.) This serum smooths my skin without making it feel tight, and since using it, I’ve noticed a significant difference in the depth of my forehead lines. They’re more filled out, and my forehead is noticeably smoother, as are my under-eyes. I’m already on my third bottle and love layering it under sunscreen or a nourishing night cream before bed. Even better? It’s nowhere near the price of Botox — and there are no needles involved.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director The Ordinary Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner, $14 “I’ve been using this milky toner religiously since last September and haven’t looked back — my skincare routine would be nothing without it. I’ve tried a lot of hydrating toners over the years, and this one is by far my favorite. It delivers long-lasting hydration for my normal-to-dry skin type [thanks to squalane, an emollient that helps trap moisture in the skin]. Meanwhile, saccharomyces, a type of yeast ferment, gently exfoliates the skin and leaves a radiant glow. It also makes for the perfect skincare base before applying makeup.” — Vanese Maddix, contributing beauty writer The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner, $8.70 “Full disclosure: my skin doesn’t usually do well with chemical exfoliants. It almost always ends in irritated skin and rosacea-related flare-ups. Yet this glycolic acid toner from The Ordinary is one of the very few formulas that has never failed me. I’ve been steadily relying on this clever formula for improving my skin texture and achieving a radiant complexion. What I love most is that this water-based AHA exfoliator also features a Tasmanian pepperberry derivative, which is a plant extract that helps soothe the skin in the process, ensuring minimal irritation (if any).” — Denise Primbet, freelance beauty writer The Ordinary Retinal 0.2% Emulsion Serum, $14.90 “This is easily the best retinoid I’ve ever tried, especially for the price. I’ve gone through two tubes of this already and have the brighter, smoother skin to show for it. If you’re a retinoid newbie, this may be a bit much to start with and might cause some purging [breakouts, redness, and sensitivity]. I didn’t experience any irritation or flaking after integrating this product into my routine. In fact, I found this serum to be one of the gentler, high-strength retinal serums I’ve tried, thanks to synthetic oat analogues that soothe and calm the skin. I’ve seen a visible reduction in my dark spots and texture, and at just under $15, it easily beats products that cost quadruple.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA, $6.70 “I have fond memories of this product, as it was my go-to face cream when I lived and worked in Hong Kong at the start of my career. The city has a subtropical climate, so it’s hot and humid for the majority of the year, and most moisturizers are just way too greasy in that type of weather. Not this formula, though. Ingredients like urea, ceramides, and fatty acids strengthen and moisturize the skin’s natural barrier without clogging pores, while hyaluronic acid adds further hydration. I enjoy the airy, fast-absorbing texture so much that I also use this under my eyes, in place of heavier eye creams. The budget-friendly price was much appreciated when I was earning an entry-level paycheck, and it’s still very much a staple for me now.” — Venus Wong, senior writer The Ordinary Glycolipid Cream Cleanser, $12.50 “Whenever I get to the bottom of this cleanser, I feel a bit sad — that’s how good it is. It’s one of the most gentle and moisturizing face washes I’ve tried (that’ll be the glycolipids; more on them in a sec), yet it dissolves foundation, sunscreen, and even thick mascara in moments, leaving my skin clean but never squeaky. It manages all that without lathering, which usually dries my skin out and leaves it feeling like it might shatter. The star ingredients are glycolipids. Without taking you back to science class, a lipid is a fat that occurs naturally in the skin. Glycolipids are fats with carbohydrates attached, and they help care for the cells that form tissues like skin. In this cleanser, they soothe and moisturize — exactly what I want from a face wash. Better still? It’s just $12.50, so I’m not too annoyed when my partner steals it from the shower.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director The Ordinary Serum Foundation, $7.50 “I’ll always have a soft spot for this serum foundation as it was one of the first I ever tried that matched my dark skin tone exactly. I have such fond memories of visiting The Ordinary’s pop-up store years ago and being perfectly shade-matched. While I’m yet to try it again since its return, the brand has confirmed that the formula is the same as when it was discontinued back in 2022. From what I remember, it was one of the OGs of the no-makeup makeup look. It glides seamlessly onto the skin and feels incredibly lightweight. As someone who can’t stand the feel of heavy foundation or skin tints, this serum formula is a dream. Here’s hoping it becomes a permanent fixture in The Ordinary’s product line.” — Vanese Maddix, contributing beauty writer The Ordinary Multi-Peptide Eye Serum, $25 “This is somewhat of a sleeper hit in The Ordinary’s catalog. I’m solidly team eye serum, since they tend to be lighter in texture and absorb much more readily than a thicker cream. My main goal with my eye area is to hydrate and brighten; this serum does all that, and feels like heaven to apply. It feels so refreshing and cooling (I don’t even leave it in the fridge!) when I gently tap it underneath my eyes, and it doesn’t create a slip-and-slide effect for any makeup that goes over it. It’s an easy, no-frills essential in my routine.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Masque, $13.80 “I love putting on this charcoal and clay clarifying mask on a Sunday; it’s part of my end-of-week reset ritual. This is a fast-acting product, due to salicylic acid [a gentle BHA that helps dissolve blackheads and dead skin cells]. I turn to this product every summer, when breakouts happen more often due to sweat and heat, and it always helps keep my skin in check. Of course, it’s important to always follow with sunscreen.” — Tanyel Mustafa, senior writer The Ordinary Soothing \u0026 Barrier Support Serum, $17 “As someone who has rosacea and dry skin, focusing on barrier repair is a must when it comes to curating my skincare routine. I’ve sworn by this serum from The Ordinary for over a year now, and I still haven’t found a formula that manages to soothe, hydrate, and nourish my skin as effectively. Not only does it have an aesthetically pleasing pink hue, but it genuinely does a great job at calming my redness and treating sudden flare-ups. It’s also packed with my favorite barrier-loving ingredients like centella asiatica, ceramides, and niacinamide.” — Denise Primbet, freelance beauty writer The Ordinary UV Filters SPF 45 Serum, $19 “I’ve been using this sunscreen since it launched last month, and it’s now a mainstay in my skincare lineup. It gives my skin a healthy, luminous finish without any uncomfortable tackiness, and it grips makeup beautifully, helping everything stay in place longer. The UV protection comes from chemical filters, so it actually disappears on all skin tones — a major upgrade from the brand’s now-discontinued mineral sunscreen, which was known for its noticeable white cast! You might wonder why it’s labeled SPF 45 instead of the more familiar SPF 50. According to The Ordinary, SPF ratings aren’t just picked by brands — they’re determined through lab testing. In this case, the formula tested at SPF 45, which they point out blocks only 0.2% less UVB rays than SPF 50. Basically, the difference is negligible. Just be sure to use enough; I aim for two finger-lengths worth of product to cover my face and neck.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director The Ordinary Squalane + Amino Acids Lip Balm, $9.50 “I’m shouting out this lip balm on behalf of myself and my husband. It’s lightweight (a key factor for men, who simply can’t cope with anything resembling a gloss) but really hydrates and smooths rough, cracked lips. I think it’s more like a lip serum, personally, since the texture is much thinner than other balms in my rotation, which I love for the daytime. (I prefer something more occlusive at night.) I’d also be remiss not to mention the packaging, which I find positively adorable — also small purse/pocket friendly.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, $10.50 “A creamy, hydrating cleanser is the only way to go when you have dry, sensitive skin like mine. This one is by far my favorite. Once massaged into your hands, it applies like a buttery oil which effortlessly cleans my face of makeup, dirt, and grime (yes, even the most stubborn of products). It does so without leaving skin feeling parched or making me feel greasy, like I need to double cleanse, as many oil cleansers can do. Better yet, it’s only $10.50. Who says you have to shell out big bucks for good quality skincare? Not The Ordinary!” — Esther Newman, affiliate writer The Ordinary 100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil, $10.90 “When I started my gua sha routine a couple of years ago, I searched far and wide for an inexpensive face oil, and this was the winner. It has the perfect consistency for the practice, since it has a rich consistency (but not too rich) and provides enough slip for the tool to glide over the entire face without absorbing too quickly. Rosehip seed oil is rich in antioxidants and omega fatty acids, which help slow the breakdown of skin cells from environmental stressors, such as pollution and UV damage. I tend to switch to this oil when I do gua sha in the winter, and notice my skin tone becoming more even as a result.” — Venus Wong, senior writer Like what you see?

    "description": "She’s a two-time Olympian, Miami Swim Week model, bestselling author — and now, Jordan Chiles is adding beauty ambassador to her already impressive list of accomplishments. The 24-year-old gymnast is the new face of Hero Cosmetics, the viral skincare brand best known for its Mighty Patch hydrocolloid stickers. Chiles, who was part of the gold-medal winning women’s gymnastics team at the 2024 Summer Olympics, has been open about her skin journey, including hyperpigmentation, texture, and breakouts. Chiles is buzzing with energy when we sit down over Zoom to chat about the new partnership. “People always ask me, ‘What do you do for your skincare?’ So I was really happy Hero wanted me to be one of their ambassadors,” she exclusively tells Refinery29. “Whether it’s dark spots or a pimple that’s coming up and I want it gone, I’ve always loved Mighty Patch.” In addition to her out-of-this-world strength, artistry, and athleticism, Chiles has also authentically shown up as herself via her competition glam; strong brows, fluttery lashes, glowy skin, and medal-worthy nail art all figured heavily in her most epic Olympic moments. As she tells me, beauty has always been something she’s passionate about. “My older sister, who is my hair and makeup artist, definitely gave me a perspective of understanding that glam is something to enjoy, have fun with, and be creative,” she says. Chiles swears by a less-is-more approach to keeping her sensitive skin looking and feeling its best. “A majority of the time, I only use a good cleanser, an exfoliator, and then a nice, silky moisturizer,” she says. “I keep it very simple, but make sure everything is hydrated and my skin looks good and glowy.” When it comes to favorite products, Chiles lights up talking about being “down bad” (same, girl) for Hero. “I have Mighty Patches in every bag, my car, my room, and probably in five different bathrooms,” she says. Her favorites? “Literally all of them, but since I go to practice a lot, [I love] the invisible ones and the dark spot ones with the prickly points.” We also bonded over a shared underrated Hero fave: the Pore Purity Cleansing Clay Mask, made with glacial sea clay and sea kelp bio-ferment to decongest skin. “It makes my face so soft —  I love it,” Chiles says. ”I’ve been recently using it two to three times a week to get my pores in the right way and all that stuff.”  For Chiles, this partnership — which includes brand campaigns, social content, and live events — is anything but skin deep. “I have [acne] scars here and there, but now I’m finally at a point where I’m positive with myself and my skin,” she says. “Literally, it took me 22 years to finally be like, look, Jordan, you’re a gorgeous girl. You have beautiful skin. Embrace that.” Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/nicole-eckels-glasshouse-fragrance-interview-49446287",
    "description": "Nicole Eckels has been surrounded by beauty for much of her life. Starting out as a resident makeup artist at Chanel's Fifth Avenue store in New York City - working there was \"my first interaction with fragrance\" and \"one of my first jobs of my life,\" Eckels says - to working for Equinox managing its corporate wellness program, she knows the beauty industry inside and out. But with time, she learned that fragrance is her true calling. \"I realized that my memory as a super creative person with ADHD is really, really bad, but with fragrance, I remember everything,\" Eckels says. \"I was the person who would walk into an elevator, and I could tell what fragrance they were wearing. I knew the scent, and I only had to smell it once.\" Between her talent for sniffing out any perfume and \"the fact that I just adore the power of fragrance so much so that I was always drawn to scent,\" she says, it's no surprise that Eckels would ultimately build such an iconic and storied home and personal fragrance brand. Enter: Glasshouse Fragrances, a home and personal fragrance brand that sells candles, diffusers, bath and body products, perfumes, and even car fragrances. For Eckels, all roads would lead to, well, not Rome. Rather, they would lead to Australia. After a friend told her she'd love it there, she booked a ticket thinking she'd return to the States within a few years. But, as with most expats, this wouldn't be the case. She stayed in Sydney, Australia full-time for 15 years and still splits time between there and the United States. It was in Sydney where she launched Glasshouse Fragrances as a result of noticing a gap in the market for home fragrance options. Today, Glasshouse Fragrances is one of the most recognizable (and loved – just read the reviews!) fragrance brands in Australia, and the passion has taken off worldwide as well. Eckels' destiny as a beauty leader was forged by her fascination, which has also contributed to her success as an entrepreneur. In 2005, when she launched Glasshouse Fragrances, she single-handedly invented a new category of \"destination fragrances\" designed to evoke an enchanting locale, with an early focus on home fragrance (though she ultimately would also create equally captivating personal fragrances as well). She has gone on to build out additional innovative categories like \"perfume pencils,\" a solid, portable perfume that you can easily bring with you on the go. From bestselling candles like Kyoto in Bloom ($55) to favorite eau de parfums like Forever Florence ($140), Eckels has created a destination fragrance for everyone. Keep reading to learn more about her and her brand. PS: What inspired you to launch Glasshouse Fragrances? Nicole Eckels: I moved to Australia, and when I arrived there, I loved it and I loved my work, but it was being there that I realized the huge gap in the marketplace for a bath and body [category] challenger to Bath and Body Works. I wanted super high-quality, glamorous, unique scents in all the formats that I used every single day. And when I moved to Australia, there wasn't much, really. There were L'Occitane, The Body Shop, and Crabtree and Evelyn. Those were my choices. I started with a candle because I couldn't find those at all, and in doing so, created the scented candle category down under. That was my first professional experience in scent. PS: What originally brought you to Australia? NE: I didn't go there for a job - that's why I stayed. I went there for adventure. I went there because I wanted to see change. I thought I was going to live in Europe. I had a friend in New York who said to me, in his thick Aussie accent, \"You've got to go to Australia. You're absolutely going to love it.\" I said OK, and I just bought a ticket. I went over and I thought, \"Wow, this place is so amazing. I think that this could be a nice life for my son.\" I was a single mother, [wondering], how do I raise a son safely in [New York City] when I'm working all the time? I thought I needed to go somewhere where it's safer, and where there's a better work/life balance. And that is why I went. The original idea is that I would just go there for a few years [until my son graduated], and then I would move back. And that ended when I started Glasshouse, because that just took over everything. We have 220 people now, and we make everything ourselves. It's just become this huge thing, and it's been my life's work. It will be 20 years old next year. PS: What is your process of creating a new product? NE: You meet some of the best perfumers, and that's the key. It's very easy to develop a scent. It's hard to have the technology and the understanding of scent design and work with the masters to create an incredible scent that's long-lasting, that's different, that's unusual in some way, that's unique in some way. And that's a journey that I'm on. That's one of my key focuses, and that's what really interests me now on the home fragrance side. I have a triangle with three points: The effect that it has on you, if it's different in some way, and product efficacy - and I'm trying to always find something in the middle. And it moves all the time. For example, I might launch something and it's an iconic, unusual, different fragrance, and then everyone will mimic that, and then it no longer is. People don't realize that we were the first to name our candles after places. That wasn't done when we did it. That is the approach I take for home fragrance, and that is also the approach I take for fine fragrance. The perfumers [for home fragrance and fine fragrance] are different. We always start with [formulating] a fine fragrance because of the materials and the system. Your skin is 96℉ and a candle is a completely different system. A fragrance diffuser is a different system. The way you experience fragrance is different, so they have to be built differently. The costs are different; the pH levels are different. But the olfactive idea can be a sketch of something and then built out based on how you're going to use it. Having the right team is so important if you're really serious about competing in the fine fragrance world. PS: How do you go about choosing a new scent and deciding what to launch? NE: A lot of it comes from the customers. The customers will tell us before we even think of it. We have such a massive following of customers all over the world, and we listen to them. They have fan groups set up. They'll say, \"I want this, I want that.\" And then we'll read those. We're listening. I'm also in the background with my team. I have the most wonderful team of developers. We're thinking about what people want. And you can't ask people that, because they don't know yet. So instead, we say, \"What problems are out there that we can solve through fragrance, through product, through personal care?\" Customers tend to want fragrances that we no longer make. That is the most common request. The next common one is them asking for a particular product that we don't make yet, whether it's a body cream or a body serum or something they want to incorporate into their life. The car diffuser came from people asking for that, so it goes both ways. We also certainly stay on top of what's happening in the market and what trends we see globally. PS: What are some fragrance trends you've noticed lately? NE: We look at product and we look at scent. The inspiration for scent often comes internally. It's more artist-led than trend-led. We don't do focus groups; we don't do any of that. We're more concerned about creating something unique, special, and beautiful. And that's really where it begins, always. And the test is seeing if it's ticking those three boxes for us and our customers. If it is, then we'll try it. We will try anything. It's fine if it doesn't work. If you don't try things, then that is, in my opinion, a disaster. Our responsibility is to give people something new and different so that they can explore and have a wonderful time with fragrance and the power of fragrance. That's what we want to do all the time.

    "description": "Much like the unpredictable nature of the stock market, my hair experiences its own fluctuations, with some winning hair days, and some where it leans more rags than riches. To be fair, I've put it through the ringer. From overusing everything from hairspray to hot styling tools, it's no wonder my hair has had its moments of rebellion. To keep it healthy, I stay up to date with leave-in conditioners of all kinds and buzzy products promising stronger, glossier hair, but I hadn't felt like I'd struck gold until I came across Color Wow's Money Mist Leave-In Conditioner ($29). I'm usually skeptical about a leave-in's ability to do anything but lightly manage frizz, but applying Money Mist gave my hair the pick-me-up it needed. With only a couple of spritzes, it was as if my dry, damaged ends stumbled upon a luxury resort after having been stranded on a deserted island for days. Even while damp, my hair felt instantly more hydrated and less brittle, which reassured me that the result was going to be just what I needed. Once I blow-dried and styled it, I could instantly see and feel the difference. Could this be the ticket to \"expensive\" looking hair that I've been waiting for? Keep reading for my full review below to find out. About Color Wow's Money Mist Leave-In Conditioner Money Mist uses a proprietary blend of amino acids meant to strengthen the hair and repair damage. It comes with a spray nozzle for easy applying, but it's a super fine mist that won't weigh down hair. It also provides heat and UV protection and detangling properties. It's suitable for all hair types. What I Like About Color Wow's Money Mist Leave-In Conditioner There's a lot to like about Money Mist, but I especially appreciate that it's no fuss. Like investing, you just sit back and watch your money work for you. A couple of spritz's out of the shower and boom - my hair looks shinier and feels silkier in texture, which to me justifies the price tag. As if feeling like I got a professional blowout done for free weren't enough, my hair felt thicker and looked, dare I say, richer. It's ideal for achieving smooth, flexible, and deeply hydrated hair. Plus, I love that this product is low risk, high reward in that you don't need to use a lot - the fine mist applicator makes it easy to spray all over but without overdoing it - so you get more bang for your buck. It's lightweight, but it still strengthens, hydrates, and makes your hair look especially healthy. If you ask me, they hit it right on the money. How To Use Color Wow's Money Mist Leave-In Conditioner Using this product is simple. First, you'll want to save this one for wash day. In the shower, shampoo and condition as usual. Once you're out, pat your hair down with a towel until it's damp then mist the product throughout your hair. Comb through to distribute the product evenly, then go on your merry way. There's no need to rinse it out. Style as usual. What To Consider Before Trying Color Wow's Money Mist Leave-In Conditioner At $29, this leave-in conditioner is pricier than your average drugstore hair product. If you're looking to treat yourself and freshen up your routine, though, I'd say this is worth the splurge. After all, how can you settle for catfish once you've tasted caviar? Where Is Color Wow's Money Mist Leave-In Conditioner Available? Color Wow's Money Mist Leave-In Conditioner is available on the brand's website, Amazon, Ulta Beauty, Revolve, and Sephora.
