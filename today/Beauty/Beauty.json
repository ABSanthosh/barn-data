    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sunny-poudel-dental-student-makeup-creativity?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "For some, a lipstick is just a lipstick. But for others, it’s a source of strength, creativity, and expression. In our series Power Faces, we’ll explore the relationship between strong women and the makeup they choose to wear — or not. In partnership with NYX, our latest subject is Sunny Poudel, a Nepalese American beauty content creator and dental student. This story was told to Fawnia Soo Hoo and edited for length and clarity. When I moved halfway across the world from Nepal to Falls Church, Virginia at 14 years old, the first friend I made was a girl named Lily. I had this little drugstore lip gloss and she asked me what it was — and then: “Can I use it?” So I shared it with her. That was how makeup started for me — as a way to connect and make friends.  In Nepal, I played around with makeup, but for the most part, it was reserved for special occasions. When I moved to the states, I felt out of place, insecure, different as a person of color living in a predominantly white area and going to a school where no one looked like me — so I hid behind makeup. Eyeliner was the only makeup my parents allowed me to wear to school, and I remember going to the CVS near my house to buy my first — NYX caught my attention because it was affordable and accessible. Looking back at pictures, my foundation was about 20 shades too light, but at the time, it made me feel better about myself. It felt like I was taking care of myself. Then I quickly realized makeup was a way to bond with others, and I started to do my friends’ makeup.  And it was a way to connect with my mom, too. I used to basically force my little sister to let me do her makeup — she was my muse — and my mom would reprimand me and say, “You can’t buy makeup; you shouldn’t do this to her.” Eventually, my mom started to ask me if I could do her makeup for her, especially if she had events to go to. My dad, though, yelled at me for wearing makeup. “You need to focus on school,” he’d say. “You’re not gonna get anywhere if you’re putting on makeup.” But when I started dental school, he realized that makeup — and being creative — helps me deal with stress. And it allows me the opportunity to meet people in a completely different industry. Now, he’s incredibly supportive. He gets it now. Growing up, I knew I wanted to be in healthcare. As an immigrant daughter, I was the one translating at doctor’s appointments for my mother, explaining things to her in a way that made sense. I saw how overwhelming it could be to navigate the healthcare system without that support. I wanted to be part of a field where I could provide that help. For me, dentistry isn’t just about fixing teeth — it’s about representation, combined with a deeper sense of purpose to help people. At the same time, I was a super artistic child, and I began to post makeup looks and upload YouTube videos, not really knowing where that would lead. When I came to New York to pursue my dental career, I started posting more consistently, because the city inspires me. People say New York is the place where all your dreams come true, and I know it’s corny, but it’s true. I’m in a city where so many things can be true, where all my dreams can come true. Why do I have to give one up for the other? Both dentistry and makeup are equally important to me, and both are a true reflection of who I am. In dentistry, there are rules, guidelines, and a specific way things are supposed to be done. Everything has to be precise and follow an exact order. You’re working in millimeters. As much as I love the structure and organization, I also don’t want to think about it after a long day at school. When I come home, I get to be creative. I get to try something different and fun. With makeup, there are no rules. I’m free to create and let things take shape however they want. Because of that, it takes the pressure off. I’m free to “mess up.” And sometimes when I do “mess up,” it leads me to a whole new makeup look I hadn’t planned. I love that makeup lets me express myself without any limitations. Makeup is my break from school, and, when I’m in school, it’s my break from everything else. It’s like turning off one part of my brain when I’m doing the other. One helps balance the other out.  Honestly, I’m not sure if I would love makeup if I was doing it all the time. But the fact that I focus on it at such a specific time allows me to be more creative. Here’s an example: I saw some photos of people with bleached eyebrows. I loved the look, so I tried it and shared it with my audience. Not everyone liked it on me, but who cares? It was fun. So much of my inspiration comes from seeing makeup on people who don’t look like me and wanting to know how it’ll look on me.  Before, I used to stick with one makeup look. Now, I want to push myself out of my comfort zone, to experiment with trends and ideas I wouldn’t normally try. Whenever I want to experiment with colorful, creative looks, I always turn to NYX for inspiration — the brand is such a great source for ideas and creativity. I did a red lip for the first time, and I loved it; I immediately felt like a boss woman. And that’s the beauty of it all: I love that the way I perceive myself changes based on what makeup I’m wearing. And I still love the fact that makeup brings people together. It’s been that way my whole life, and it’s how I made one of my closest friends at dental school. We were at a party in our first year, and she was upset. She wanted to go home because she thought she looked oily. I said to her, “Girl, I have my beauty powder right here.”  It was the first time we met, and we laugh about it to this day. “How were you so comfortable just blotting my face?” she asked me recently. And I replied, “Because I saw you needed it.” I love that about makeup. Shop Sunny’s makeup look: Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/breakup-haircuts-psychology-47944518",
    "description": "We all know someone who's gotten a \"breakup haircut\" after a dramatic split. Whether you've gone through the transformation yourself or have been dragged to the salon by a close friend to experience the phenomena first-hand, there's something about chopping it all off that signals this new freedom. While there's no denying that a breakup haircut can feel liberating and transformative, can it actually be beneficial to your mental health? Is there a psychological reason it feels so therapeutic? Does hair hold trauma like people say? Turns out, there may be something there. Experts Featured in This Article Christie Ferrari, also known as Dr. C, is a clinical psychologist and blogger. Daryl Appleton, LMHC is a psychotherapist and the founder of the podcast Feelings \u0026 Other F Words. Savannah St. Jean is a hairstylist and owner of Savannah Rae Beauty in Florida. \"People sometimes will look for something tangible to demonstrate the closing of a chapter or the beginning of a new one, and your hair is one of the most obvious ways to do it as everyone will notice,\" says clinical psychologist Christie Ferrari. \"Who doesn't want to look their best post-break up?\" Psychotherapist Daryl Appleton, MD, added, \"When we change something about our appearance, we tend to attract more attention, either positive or negative. Regardless this reinforcement helps us not only feel seen but also can act as a signal to others that something has changed.\" \"When we feel physically or emotionally hurt, it is a natural reaction to want to change or redirect to avoid this pain.\" People have a lot of different coping mechanisms when it comes to dealing with the stress of a breakup - taking up a new hobby, shopping for new clothes, hitting the gym more - and changing your hair is just one of them. \"When we feel physically or emotionally hurt, it is a natural reaction to want to change or redirect to avoid this pain,\" said Dr. Appleton. \"Emotional hurt is much harder to change or redirect, so we tend to focus on the more tangible physical changes. It allows for some more immediate release and relief.\" A new haircut is a fast and easy way to boost your confidence, but before booking your appointment, you'll want to make sure you're doing it for the right reasons - if not, it's just a quick-fix. \"We have to make sure we're changing for ourselves,\" said Dr. C. \"We are the ones who want the change and that it's not about changing for someone else. Otherwise, we risk a lot of things: dependency, imposter syndrome, and not following through with the change.\" Dr. Appleton added: \"The only harm is if the inside work isn't being done. You can change your hair a million different ways but if you don't work on the 'inside stuff' then it's just a band-aid on a bullet hole.\" Hairstylist Savannah St. Jean has seen plenty of breakup haircuts happen in real-time and refers to them as hitting a reset button, but acknowledged that it's also a risky endeavor. \"Sometimes our highly emotional state makes us want a fresh new look, but I highly suggest treading carefully,\" said St. Jean. She recommends her clients make sure the style change is practical - for instance, you don't want to lose your ability to pull your hair into a ponytail with a big chop if that's your go-to style. But that's not to say St. Jean doesn't believe in the magic of a breakup haircut; she does. \"With a little bit of professional advice, it can be invigorating and positive and put an extra bounce in their step. I think if it's done right, it can be exactly what they need to move forward.\" Jessica Harrington (she/her) is the senior editor of PS Beauty, where she oversees coverage around makeup, skin care, hair, tattoos, and more.

    "description": "It's no secret that Zoë Kravitz has built quite an impressive résumé over the years. The forever cool girl has collaborated with Yves Saint Laurent Beauté, revived yet another hairstyle trend in pop culture (hello, micro braids), and starred as the one and only Catwoman. Despite her busy work and social schedule, Kravitz has always made time to add to her tattoo collection. According to Inked, Kravitz got her first tattoo, a small outline of a heart with umlauts above it on her wrist, at 18 as a symbol of self-love. Since then, Kravitz's tattoo collection has grown to an impressive 56 known designs, both big and small. It includes styles ranging from fine line and illustration to geometric designs - she even has a matching tattoo with Jason Momoa. Most recently, she got a detailed snake coiled around an anatomical human heart completed on her right forearm by celebrity tattoo artist Dr. Woo (who once told PS Kravitz is \"one of my oldest clients and friends because she used to come in with her dad [Lenny]\"). The two have been frequent collaborators for years, with the artist also contributing a flying eagle, a palm tree, and a dragonfly coverup, just to name a few designs. In an interview with GQ in 2022, the actor shared she will be removing some of her ink. Still, many remain. Keep reading for a complete guide of Zoë Kravitz's tattoos - past and present - as well as their meanings.",
