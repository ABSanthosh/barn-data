If you’re looking to enter 2025 with your healthiest head of hair yet, look no further than Briogeo’s biggest sale of the year.  Founder Nancy Twine left a career in finance to launch her dream brand, inspired by her mother’s homemade beauty recipes. A decade later, the plant-powered hair care range is bigger than ever, and proudly makes formulas for all hair types and textures. You may have heard of Briogeo’s bestselling Don’t Despair, Repair Deep Conditioning mask and tingly Scalp Revival Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo, but the brand has plenty of other underrated products and tools in its assortment. Best of all, everything is 30% off from now until Cyber Monday. Below, R29’s beauty editors share their Briogeo favorites — all on sale now. DashDividers_1_500x100 Don’t Despair, Repair Deep Conditioning Mask, $39.00 $27.30 “There’s a reason why this restoring hair mask consistently wins awards. The key ingredients are proteins, which boast strengthening properties — ideal for those who regularly use hot brushes or other heated tools and tend to forget the heat protection (that’ll be me). It acts like scaffolding for weak hair strands and happens to seal my split ends thanks to a mega mix of nourishing, shine-enhancing oils like rosehip and almond oil. When my hair is in need of some serious TLC, usually in the colder months, I use this in place of conditioner for a serious moisture boost. It’s one hair mask I’ll always recommend to my friends on the lookout for something transformative. Even better? It works on all hair types and textures.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Scalp Revival Rosemary Pre-wash Oil, $32.00 $22.40 “I love a pre-shampoo scalp treatment to help hydrate and reinvigorate my roots, and Briogeo’s has become a fast favorite. It’s made with rosemary (which is sometimes referred to as “nature’s minoxidil”) to help encourage hair growth, as well as lipids to hydrate and soothe an irritated scalp. I like to leave this on for 10 minutes before shampooing, and let my hair air-dry post-shower. The result: Hair so soft and healthy you can’t stop touching it.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Scalp Revival Micro-exfoliating Shampoo, $42.00 $29.40 “A recent trip to a trichologist uncovered a bout of seborrheic dermatitis, a type of scalp eczema that feeds off of oils on the scalp and results in yellow flakes that can cause itching. The easiest solution was to wash my hair more frequently, and once a week, I also enlist the help of a gentle scalp scrub to eradicate pesky flakes that cling to my hair. I love that this lathers up on contact with water so you don’t feel like you’re rubbing sand onto your head. The addition of tea tree and mint oils means it’s satisfyingly invigorating and makes my hair and scalp feel brand new. There’s no need to worry about drying effects, though. This formula is filled to bursting with richer ingredients like coconut oil, which gives my hair a nice shine. A little goes a long way.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Farewell Frizz Blow Dry \u0026 Heat Protectant, $26.00 $18.20 “I’ve been heat-styling my hair more lately, and found that my thick, fine lengths loves a weightless balm to help condition and protect. I got Briogeo’s Farewell Frizz cream as a Sephora freebie, and it was love at first feel. It’s hydrating enough for my dry strands (they drink it right up), and it really does help smooth my halo of flyaways and frizz. At a discount, I’ll be stocking up.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Vegan Boar Bristle Brush, $28.00 $19.60 “The world is sleeping on this brush. Briogeo’s vegan boar bristle brush made me realize the importance of daily brushing — and my hair has truly not been the same since. I’ve gone through multiples and even bought an Amazon brush cleaning kit to keep mine in tip-top shape. It smooths and adds gorgeous shine to your hair, and I love that no boars were harmed in the process. Whenever friends ask me if it’s worth spending more on a certain expensive boar bristle brand, I point them towards this one instead.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Superfoods Replenishing Shampoo + Conditioner, $52.00 $36.40 “Briogeo makes a couple different formulations of its Superfoods shampoos and conditioners, but this one is my favorite. The hero ingredients — apple, kale, and matcha — wouldn’t be out of place on my grocery list, and I love that the packaging reminds me of a green juice. It’s not a harshly clarifying product, and it won’t load your hair up with too much moisture, making it feel greasy. In other words, it’s the Goldilocks of shampoo and conditioners. My hair is always so soft and shiny after using it, and the light apple scent is a joy for the senses.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Scalp Revival Dry Shampoo, $25 $17.50 “Something about dry shampoo in an aerosol can feels aggressive on my sensitive scalp, so I try to avoid it where I can. That’s where Briogeo’s Scalp Revival comes in. All you do is shake the bottle slightly, twist the lid to open and squeeze. Rather than spitting out powder, it lends a blanket of even coverage, which makes massaging it into my roots and brushing it out so much easier. I love that it makes my shorter front pieces look voluminous, as though I’ve re-styled them with a hot brush.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Like what you see?

    "title": "The Jheri Curl Is Back and Better Than Ever",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/jheri-curls-49397635",
    "description": "There's no denying that we're in an era where iconic beauty trends of decades past are back in a big way. From the sultry '90s brown lipstick that once dominated grunge and R\u0026B aesthetics to the defiant return of the infamous side part (challenging the long-term reign of the middle part) it's clear that beauty is cyclical. The latest obsession in this retro revival? The glossy, defined '80s Jheri Curl. The inspiration for this trend stems back to singers Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, and cult-classic movies such as \"Coming To America,\" where actors Eric La Salle and Darryl Jenkins are remembered for their iconic \"SoulGlo\" scene. Flash forward to today, and we're seeing celebs like Drake sporting the style - defined, loose curls that are so shiny they appear nearly wet. The rebirth of the Jheri curl is just one example of how deeply-rooted certain hairstyles are in Black cultural memory. To help us learn more about the origin of the Jheri curl and how to wear it today, we enlisted the expertise of hairstylist Nelson Vercher. Ahead, more on what's behind the trend and how it's being adapted for the modern era, combining equal parts nostalgia with contemporary styling techniques. Experts Featured in This Article Nelson Vercher is a master hairstylist at Rita Hazan Salon in New York City who has worked with celebrities like Kelly Rowland and Naomi Campbell. What Is a Jheri Curl? A Jheri curl is a hairstyle that was popular among Black folks during the late 1970s (hitting its peak in the '80s and early '90s), featuring loose curls that are extremely shiny. \"The style was intended for people with coarse hair texture who wanted a softer, more defined curl, something similar to a perm,\" Vercher tells PS. Where did the trend get its start? The style was the brainchild of chemist and stylist Robert William Redding. Redding's innovative contributions to hair care extended beyond this iconic look; he was also responsible for developing hair conditioner and pH-balanced shampoo. Marketed primarily to Black men and women, the Jheri curl was promoted as a low-maintenance, wash-and-wear alternative to chemical relaxers. Its promise of easier upkeep made it an attractive option for those seeking a more manageable hair care routine. Soon, the trend picked up steam with prominent figures in the entertainment industry. However, there were also some notable drawbacks. The style's signature sheen was achieved through the use of an activator, an oil-based product with some undesirable side effects. It was notorious for staining clothing, furniture, and virtually anything it came into contact with, posing practical challenges for those who embraced the style. How To Achieve a Jheri Curl There are several ways stylists create this look - and FYI, these days, there's none of that irksome activator required. If you have thicker, tight coils (think a 4C type), hair is prepped with a wet styling product, such as curling custard, like the Pattern Styling Custard ($28), curled with an iron, then set in place with perm rod hair rollers, such as the Salon Care Pink Long Curved Perm Rods ($4), explains Vercher. However, if you have a 3C hair type, your stylist will likely first use a mild relaxer to break down the texture a bit, then create more of the desired curl pattern with the perm rod rollers. For those with thick or extra-frizzy hair, Vercher says prepping hair with a keratin treatment, in lieu of a relaxer, is another option. Ask your stylist for a custom keratin treatment, which also breaks down the hair texture in order to then be able to create more defined curls, he says. \"The plus with the keratin is it slowly washes out, so you don't have to commit [to the style] for too long,\" he adds. You can also DIY a Jheri curl at home. Vercher recommends using a texturizer (a milder form of a relaxer), applying a setting solution, and flat twisting your hair around perm rods, then letting it sit for 10 minutes before rinsing. The big caveat? Any type of chemical treatment can be damaging to the hair, particularly if not done correctly. It's imperative to follow all product instructions carefully and ideally consult with a pro hairstylist before trying this at home. Jheri Curl Hairstyles Back in the day, the style itself was most often worn down, sprayed with lots of \"activator juice,\" to add mega-watt shine. \"The Jheri curl was intended to create wash-and-wear looks for very kinky textures,\" Vercher says. \"You would see lots of bobs, asymmetrical bobs, or just long curly/wavy hair looks.\" Those are all still good choices today; adding a Jheri curl to these popular styles make for a fun and unexpected twist. To ensure you get that signature sheen, making sure hair is moisturized is key (using both a wash-out and leave-in conditioner is a good way to do just that). We like the Briogeo Don't Despair, Repair! Split End Repair + Moisturizing Leave-In Conditioner ($29) and The Doux Mousse Def Texture Foam ($15). You can also amp up the shine by rubbing argan or coconut oil through the hair (try the SheaMoisture 100% Pure Argan Oil Multi-Tasking Oil ($11); just make sure to do so gently, so that the curls stay intact and don't lose their shape.
