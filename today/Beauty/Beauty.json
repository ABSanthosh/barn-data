    "description": "When shopping for beauty products, it’s easy to gravitate to specialty stores like Sephora and Ulta, where where every aisle is dedicated to all things beauty. However, there’s one retailer that always claims a sizable chunk of my paycheck (just consult my order histories) — and that’s Nordstrom. Having grown up in the heyday of mall culture, I spent endless hours among the impeccably-lit displays at my local Nordstrom counter, swatching and spritzing to my heart’s content. Highly-anticipated Anniversary Sale aside, the iconic department store is home to, in my humble opinion, one of the best beauty selections in the country — an accolade I don’t throw around lightly. From niche fragrance brands to the latest in beauty tech, Nordstrom’s curation of hair care, makeup, skincare products — and more — is top-tier. (Plus, the retailer’s loyalty program often runs special point multiplier events on its beauty and fragrance assortment, allowing you to rack up rewards fast.)But hey, don’t just take my word for it . Below, I asked R29’s discerning group of editors to divulge the best brands to shop at Nordstrom — here are their ultimate favorites. At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff. All of our market picks are independently selected and curated by the editorial team. All product details reflect the price and availability at the time of publication. If you buy or click on something we link to on our site, Refinery29 may earn commission. Victoria Beckham Beauty Lid Lustre Eyeshadow\"I recently tested a bunch of products from Victoria Beckham Beauty, and was so blown away by the brand. In addition to feeling so luxurious and timeless (the tortoiseshell packaging feels like it’s from a different time!), the quality of the formulas is really on another level. Like MAC, the brand has also been very selective of its retail presence, but recently announced that it was entering Nordstrom’s rarified beauty assortment. My choice pick that I highly recommend you swatch IRL at your local Nordstrom store is Lid Lustre eyeshadow, a dazzling, shimmery way to gild lids in a single swipe. (Photos truly don’t do it justice!)\" — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior WriterVictoria Beckham Beauty Lid Lustre Eyeshadow, $, available at NordstromCharlotte Tilbury Glowgasm Beauty Wand Highlighter\"If I had to use just one makeup brand, I’d probably choose Charlotte Tilbury. It has everything — even skincare to prep your base — and having met Charlotte herself recently, I now know just how much time, effort and research goes into each and every product. I was so impressed. My all time favorite, though, has to be the Glowgasm Beauty Wand Highlighter (especially the shade Peachgasm), which I use as a cream blush. Unlike others, which are packed with chunky, glittery pigments, this is so finely-milled and appears like a glossy filter on the skin. Best of all, it doesn’t budge until you see fit to remove it at the end of the day. I’ve used a handful of these right down to the last drop — they’re that good.\" — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty DirectorCharlotte Tilbury Glowgasm Beauty Wand Highlighter, $, available at NordstromChanel BAUME ESSENTIEL Multi-Use Glow Stick\"When I think of the Nordstrom beauty floor, Chanel is the first name that comes to mind. I have such fond memories of visiting the counter with my mom, marveling at the elegant jars, iconic lipsticks, and indulging in tiny samples of their decadent creams on my baby-soft skin. Even now, Nordstrom remains my go-to destination for the ultimate in luxury beauty, whether I’m restocking a classic Chanel fragrance or picking up a must-have Baume Essential. And for those of you who aren’t familiar with the latter, it’s essentially the grown-up version of a highlighter – the chicest, most subtle way to add light and dimension to your face, IMHO.\" — Sara Tan, Global Beauty DirectorChanel BAUME ESSENTIEL Multi-Use Glow Stick, $, available at NordstromD.S. \u0026 Durga Big Sur Eucalyptus Eau de Parfum\"Every cool beauty editor I know has a D.S. \u0026 Durga perfume in their collection. The Brooklyn-based brand’s ethos is rooted in “armchair travel” — aka how a certain smell can transport you back to a very specific time and place — and its creations are all fittingly interesting and unique. My recent favorite has been Big Sur Eucalyptus, a woody cypress scent that takes me right back to my hiking trip to Alishan Mountain in Taiwan last year. I love taking big breaths as I spray this on my pulse points, as the refreshing whiffs of green apple and eucalyptus never fail to open up my chest.\" — Venus Wong, Senior WriterD.S. \u0026 Durga Big Sur Eucalyptus Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromWestman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick\"If you know me, you know I am a hardcore Westman Atelier fan. I own most of the brands products from contour sticks, to glowy highlighters, and natural mascaras, and its products totally align with my barely there makeup preferences. I also find the formulas don’t trigger my sensitive skin. Plus, the packaging is so chic, minimal, and just feels luxe, I’ve given so many of the brand’s liquid lip balms as gifts throughout the years. The first Westman item I bought was the Face Trace Contour Stick. I love the shade ‘Biscuit’ because it has a cooler understone so it doesn’t appear orange like some other contour or bronzing products I’ve tried. The texture is also so creamy and melts into the skin easily. It looks so natural I’ll usually just blend it over my tinted sunscreen — no foundation or concealer required.\" — Kate Spencer, Senior Affiliate Partnerships ManagerWestman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick, $, available at NordstromMAC Cosmetics MACximal Silky Matte Lipstick\"MAC Cosmetics has always been strategic with its retail partnerships. For most of its four decades of being in business, you could only shop them at MAC stores or on the brand’s website. Nowadays, they are still only in a few retailers – and Nordstrom is among the rare few. After all these years, the artistry-focused brand still makes some of the most innovative, high-performing products around. My latest favorite: the Macximal Silky Matte lipstick, which combines the bold pigmentation and matte finish of the brand’s Retro Matte lipsticks in a silky, non-drying (!) formula.\" — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior WriterMAC Cosmetics MACximal Silky Matte Lipstick, $, available at NordstromTata Harper Retinoic Nutrient Face Oil\"I discovered Tata Harper when I worked as a travel editor at a newspaper. So many luxury hotels on my bucket list (The Lanesborough Hotel in London, Le Coucou Meribel in the French Alps, and Gleneagles in Scotland, just to name a few) feature Tata Harper facials on their spa menus. After sampling its Retinoic Nutrient Face Oil, I’m now crystal clear on why the brand has received so much love from five-star stays: The texture is rich without making my skin feel like an oil slick, and it's packed with natural retinoids derived from rosehip. I love massaging this into my face with my fingertips after my usual skincare routine, and I wake up with plumper and brighter skin the next day.\" — Venus Wong, Senior WriterTata Harper Retinoic Nutrient Face Oil, $, available at NordstromLike what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Many of us see \u0026 Other Stories as a destination to shop effortlessly chic fashion staples, but we’d argue that the brand’s beauty range is equally worthy of your attention. Tucked between pages of collarless blazers and slip dresses are a handful of makeup and body care products that look and feel so much more expensive than they actually are. But it’s the brand’s fragrance collection which has impressed beauty enthusiasts the most. Fun fact: Famous perfumer Jérôme Epinette — who has created scents for the likes of Byredo, Victoria Beckham Beauty, and Floral Street — is the nose behind many of them, including Perle de Coco and Fleur de Mimosa. This January, the brand has expanded its fragrance offering to include four newbies: Desert Edition, Nocturnal Tales, Blank Pages, and Paper Blossom, all $45 each. These new scents from \u0026 Other Stories manage to pull off a rare feat: They are affordable perfumes that not only smell luxurious and complex but linger beautifully on the skin. While many affordable perfumes have impressed us lately (think Dossier and Oakcha), they tend to be weaker on the longevity front. \u0026 Other Stories’ offering feels different. Featuring notes like tobacco, cashmere, and pear, these newcomers don’t smell anything like a mass-fashion fragrance, and punch far above their weight when it comes to wear time and value for money. Two Refinery29 beauty writers (and self-confessed fragrance obsessives) have put these eaux de toilette to the test this week. Read ahead for why one of them could very well be your signature scent in 2025. DashDividers_1_500x100 \u0026 Other Stories Desert Edition Eau de Toilette, $45 “Desert Edition is deep and syrupy, a little like Parfums de Marly’s delectable Safanad, which I have on rotation in my fragrance wardrobe. Incredibly, it’s a snip of the price. The treacly nuances are down to vanilla-esque tonka bean, oak, and honey. While the brand describes it as a woody fragrance, to me it earns a space in the gourmand camp; it’s sweet — but not tooth-achingly so — and it’s very moreish thanks to edible notes of cardamom, pistachio, and hints of dried fruit. I can’t stop smelling my wrists when I wear it. I’m also surprised by how well it lingers on the skin and clothes for an eau de toilette. It gives my eaux de parfum — and even extraits, which boast an impressive 20 to 30% fragrance oil — a run for their money.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director Shop \u0026 Other Stories DashDividers_1_500x100 \u0026 Other Stories Nocturnal Tales Eau de Toilette, $45 “I almost never encounter a scent that immediately makes me sit up and google its ingredients, but Nocturnal Tales manages to be a rare exception. It has one of the most interesting profiles I’ve smelled in recent memory. You’re greeted by the crisp smell of tea leaves (something along the oolong variety, if I have to guess), while the tobacco note gradually introduces itself. I’m normally not a great fan of smoky scents but this one smells more like incense and stays close to the skin. It captures my heart from afar thanks to the velvety, honeyed aroma of osmanthus, one of my favorite edible flowers often found in Chinese desserts. It reminds me of a cozy teahouse in the best way possible.” — Venus Wong, senior writer Shop \u0026 Other Stories DashDividers_1_500x100 \u0026 Other Stories Blank Pages Eau de Toilette, $45 “With musk and sandalwood, Blank Pages reminds me a lot of Diptyque’s Papier with a little hint of Calvin Klein CK One. It’s woody and clean, which makes me feel comforted, and while it also features spicy pepper and floral orris, it’s never overpowering. In fact, it’s one of the more subtle scents in \u0026 Other Stories’ burgeoning collection and reminds me of just-showered skin and ‘90s nostalgia. You’d think the freshness would disappear as it dries down, especially as it’s an eau de toilette, but it really sticks around. Wearing it is like taking a breath of crisp air. I imagine I’ll gravitate to this for spring and summer when I want something clean and soapy but with a bit more depth and interest.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director Shop \u0026 Other Stories DashDividers_1_500x100 \u0026 Other Stories Paper Blossom Eau de Toilette, $45 “I’ve been turning to this sweet and fruity scent on miserable days when I feel like spring can’t come soon enough. Paper Blossom is anchored by effervescent notes of pear, which envelop me in a cloud of crisp sugariness (without going overboard). Pear is a note that typically fades quickly but it’s quite enduring in this eau de toilette, and the fruitiness hangs in the air around me for hours. I can also detect agave. Vanilla and tonka at the base keep the scent warm and familiar. Overall, this isn’t the most unique perfume in the collection but it’s a crowd-pleaser that will definitely get you tons of ‘you smell nice!’ comments.” — Venus Wong, senior writer Shop \u0026 Other Stories Shop our favorite \u0026 Other Stories perfumes Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/aaliyah-barbie-black-girls-essay-49423439",
    "description": "Growing up, I, like many girls, had a Barbie doll. From her spunky outfits and fun hairstyles to her various professions, the iconic toy was as much of a source of empowerment as it was enjoyment. The doll's manufacturer, Mattel, has created many different versions of Barbie over the years, but the latest is one I wish I could've personally experienced growing up. On Jan. 16, Mattel released a new Barbie honoring the late R\u0026B princess, Aaliyah. Seeing this creation immediately filled me with a sense of happiness - but I also felt a great longing for a doll like this during my formative years. The now-sold-out Aaliyah Barbie - which came out on what would have been the singer's 46th birthday - is the latest in Mattel's Music Series, made in collaboration with the singer's brother, Rashad Haughton. Since Aaliyah lost her life in a horrific plane crash in 2001 at only 22 years old, Haughton has remained steadfast in preserving his sister's legacy, especially through many major collaborations (including one with MAC in 2018), but this one with Mattel hit me differently. Although I was only 3 years old when the singer passed, I was always inspired by her, especially as I entered my high school years. I loved her style, her effortless yet distinct approach to beauty through side parts and inner winged eyeliner - her whole élan. From Bratz to Barbies, I loved playing with my dolls, giving them different roles, putting them in my toy cars, sliding them down my grandmother's stairs, and imagining my own little world. Trips to the toy aisles of Target and Toys R US were also part of the childhood escapades I highly anticipated. In hindsight, I realize that the majority of the dolls I owned and saw in stores did not look like me - an experience many Black girls can relate to. Image Source: Getty/Photo by Sal Idriss/Redferns When I was younger, many of Barbie's collections were exclusionary to Black people, with most of these dolls being white with either blond or brunette hair. There were exceptions here and there, but even many of those dolls tokenized Black people and garnered significant criticism (a particular Oreo-themed Black Barbie made in the '90s comes to mind. . .). While I loved all of my Barbies equally, none were a true reflection of me or the woman I would become. I grew up in Brooklyn, which was a melting pot of different cultures and particularly welcoming for my migrant Jamaican family, so I wasn't aware that there was a world that didn't always embrace my people. Confidence and pride in identity were always pushed in my home environment, so I didn't experience racial stereotyping or prejudice as a child. My family and friends didn't make me feel unpretty or that my Blackness was an inferior alternative, but the toy shelves did. Our relationship with beauty doesn't just begin when we put on our mother's red lipstick for the first time. It begins from the moment we enter the world, with the people we're around, the places we see, and the conversations we hear influencing the way we look at ourselves. The young mind is sharper than we think, with many experiences having a lasting impact, which is why having a Black doll like Aaliyah would have been so monumental for me to grow up with. While her beauty is awe-inspiring, it's bigger than her physicality.
