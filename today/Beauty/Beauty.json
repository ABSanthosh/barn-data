    "description": "Image Source: Getty/Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic For some people, having a partner get a tattoo of you would be jarring, but for Nicola Peltz Beckham, it always felt right. \"I was just so obsessed with him,\" she says of her now husband, Brooklyn Peltz Beckham. \"If I wasn't, then I would be like, wait. . . what?\" Clearly, the feeling was mutual, as Brooklyn has amassed over 70 tattoos just for her to date. With so many options to choose from, you'd think it'd be hard to pick a favorite, but not for her. \"The one of me that I love is my eyes on the back of his neck. But I love when he surprises me and does tattoos for my family,\" she says. \"It really means a lot to me.\" Other notable designs in Nicola's honor include a quote from her grandmother in her handwriting, her mother's rosary on his hands, a bunny in honor of her other grandmother by that name, and something even more permanent than a ring to tell the world he's taken - a tattoo of the word \"married\" on his hand. The couple's synergy doesn't end there - they're also known for matching on date nights and red carpets, and getting twinning skin-care treatments. \"I'll bet getting a facial - I've gone to Lena at Carasoin Salon since I was 17 - and Brooklyn will just walk in and hang as I'm getting my pimples popped,\" Nicola says. \"But there was one time we got two facials and they connected our beds, and [Brooklyn] was like, 'That was so fun.'\" But that's not a regular occurrence. \"He literally washes his face with body wash.\" If you think Nicola's perfect skin comes just from facials alone, think again. She credits her mother, who encouraged sunscreen from an early age. \"She would dunk me in it as a toddler,\" Nicola says. Her go-to formula now is the Isdin Fusion Water Magic SPF 40 Sunscreen ($38). \"It's tricky to find the perfect sunblock,\" which is why she's partnered with the brand. \"It lays perfectly under makeup. I even put it with my makeup - I'll put a squirt in my hand and put a squirt of foundation in my hand and I'll just mix both of them,\" she says. \"It just goes on really, really nicely, and I feel like that's hard to find.\" Image Source: Nicola Peltz Beckham Her other beauty must-haves include the Benefit Cosmetics Benetint Liquid Lip + Cheek Blush Stain ($26) and the Dior Rosy Glow Blush ($40). \"I feel like blush changes my face. I feel naked without it.\" When it comes to hair, Nicola made a dramatic shift from the bright blond she had at her wedding to her natural brunette shade in 2022, and she's stuck with it ever since. She loves it so much she's been contemplating if she should have made the change sooner. \"I asked my mom, 'Wait, should I have been brunette for my wedding?' And she's like, 'You're fine, get over it.'\" There's a new hair color that's calling her name, however, so don't be surprised if the brown hue doesn't stick around. \"Brooklyn is always like, 'I want you to go ginger.' He's randomly been telling me that,\" she says. \"That would be so fun.\" Changing up her look doesn't intimidate her; she welcomes it. \"I love any excuse to change and morph into something. That's why I love acting so much. If there's a role that came around and I had to change the way I look, I would love that.\" That role may be on the horizon. With the release of \"Lola\" in 2024 marking her writing and directorial debut, Nicola is just getting started, and she revealed that she's currently working on a new show and new film for 2025. Brittany Leitner (she/her) is a New York-based contributing beauty writer at PS. She has over 10 years of experience working in beauty, health, wellness, travel, and celebrity news. Brittany holds a degree in magazine journalism from Syracuse University and previously held editorial positions at Elite Daily and \"The Dr. Oz Show\" before working as a freelance journalist for the past three years.",

    "description": "Even if your body is already covered in tattoos from head to toe, there's something fun and rebellious about secret ink. On the flip side, if you're still easing into the idea of your first small design, getting something etched on one of the best places to hide tattoos can make it all seem less stressful. No matter your reasoning, hidden tattoos are a great way to ink your body just for you (though don't be surprised if you suddenly feel the need to post it all over Instagram). Some of the best hidden places for a tattoo are your rib cage, sternum, stomach, and back. You also can't go wrong with hidden small hip tattoos; they're a classic. Depending on the placement you choose, you can play peekaboo or let it be your own little secret. The best hiding places for tattoos come with different pain levels. A rib or neck tattoo might be a little more painful than a design on your thighs. Luckily, these types of designs are typically tiny with fine lines and little to no shading, so they're relatively quick and easy. Whether you're a tattoo newbie or this isn't your first rodeo, we rounded up some of the best hidden tattoo places for you to peruse ahead. Keep scrolling to see how to hide a tattoo like a pro.",

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/iced-french-manicure-nail-trend?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "As classic as they come, the French manicure remains one of the most popular nail looks of all time for good reason: it’s chic, goes with everything, and never looks dated. It makes sense, then, that with minimalist manicures dominating as the most popular nail trends of 2025 so far, we’re seeing many nail artists looking for ways to upgrade the humble French tip for the year ahead. We’ve already spotted the seriously glowy tinted French taking off and the ultra-cool chrome French tips, but spring’s latest upgrade might just be our favorite yet. Enter: the “iced French”.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Виктория Климович | маникюр Минск| обучение | онлайн | курсы (@viktoriya.klimovich) What is the iced French manicure? We first noticed this look on the Instagram feed of bridal manicurist Carmelina (aka @hicarmelina), who shared a photo of a chic frosted manicure, which she coined the “iced French”. A fresh upgrade to the original French manicure, Carmelina describes the look as being “clean, minimal, and elevated with a subtle shimmer that gives a cool, frosted finish.” Similar to the “angel” chrome manicure that emerged earlier in the year, it has an almost ethereal feel to it thanks to the soft, silvery color palette and sheeny finish. “The real magic happens when the light hits it,” says Carmelina. “It glows in the most understated, elegant way.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by S e l f i s h (@selfish_london) How do you create the iced French manicure? This look is all about layering sheer colors with soft textures, but it’s actually quite simple to achieve. To start, a milky base is needed to keep everything feeling light and dream-like. Carmelina is clear that the key to this look is opting for a milky white color and avoiding a pink base. Try something like Manucurist’s Green Natural Nail Polish in Milky White, £14. Next, a soft chrome top coat — Carmelina suggests a classic pearlescent shade — for the “signature iced effect”. Ask your manicurist for The Gel Bottle’s Pearl Chrome Pigment, $12.99, or try Essie’s Original Nail Art Studio Special Effects Nail Polish Topcoat in Cosmic Chrome, $13, at home. View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝘓𝘢𝘴𝘩 𝘌𝘹𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴 𝘉𝘪𝘢𝘣 𝘉𝘳𝘰𝘸𝘴 𝘔𝘜𝘈 (@the_deluxe_studio) Finally, finish with a “delicate French tip” as a nod to the classic manicure with a modern edge. “Any thin brush that you have on hand will work beautifully,” Carmelina says. Feeling inspired? Here are a few of our favorite iced French manicures for your next nail appointment. View this post on Instagram A post shared by نسيم رويال (@nasimroyal.nailbar) Chiffon French View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nicole | Gel Nail Artist (@nailsxbellaluna) Gel nail artist Nicole (aka @nailsxbellaluna) has created the most ethereal iced French manicure by pairing a milky base coat with a soft white chrome top coat. Utter perfection.  Cat Eye View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mélo Beauty Lounge (@melobeauty.bh) Cat eye nails are known for their ultra-high-shine finish, which means they pair perfectly with this frosty trend. Created by Mélo Beauty Lounge, the square nail shape and almost holographic effect make for a seriously cool nail look. Clean Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by House of Nails (@house__of__nails) Perfectly executed by luxury manicurist Laura (aka @house__of__nails), this looks like a classic French manicure at first glance but is elevated by an icy chrome top coat. It’s an upgraded version of clean girl nails. Iced Milk View this post on Instagram A post shared by lauren kay (@laurenkaysims) Lauren Kay‘s soft and milky set has a subtle frosted finish that adds interest to a simple (but perfectly executed) creamy French manicure. These would make beautiful wedding day nails. Sparkling Frost View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kim Truong (@kimkimnails) Make like celebrity nail artist Kim Truong and add a subtle layer of pixie dust shimmer to your set for extra dimension when it catches the light. Chilled Butter View this post on Instagram A post shared by Britt | Sydney nail artist (@bb.claws) While the French manicure is characterized by its white tip, you can really play into the “iced” element by mixing up the color. We’re obsessed with the butter yellow shade that Sydney-based nail artist Britt has used here. Ice Ombré View this post on Instagram A post shared by VANCOUVER NAIL ARTIST (@kloudy_nail.studio) The ombré French — a seamless blend on the classic tip — is taking over nail salons. Add a modern twist with a dusting of silver chrome powder for an icy, ethereal finish like this look by @kloudy_nail.studio on Instagram. This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK.

    "title": "Can Spraying Perfume Really Mess With Your Hormones?",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/perfume-fragrance-hormonal-effects?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Is there anything better than unboxing a perfume you’ve been dying to try — and falling in love at first spritz? It’s like unlocking a brighter mood or a shiny new version of yourself. That’s exactly how I felt when a very viral, very expensive fragrance landed on my doorstep recently. Even with friends over, I wasted no time bathing myself in the stuff. As expected, it was an instant hit among the group, except for one, who edged further and further away from my plume of scent. “None for me, thanks,” she said, arms outstretched. “Perfume can seriously mess with your hormones.”  Having worked in beauty for over 10 years, this isn’t the first time I’ve heard concerns about products that might affect hormones. Remember when we were all obsessed with buying “clean” skincare? The movement demonized certain ingredients like parabens (preservatives needed to protect products from bacteria) and sulphates (surfactants that give products their lather). Suddenly, everyone was worried about “endocrine disruptors” — substances that are said to interfere with the body’s hormonal system, impacting everything from weight and mood to fertility. Dermatologists have widely dispelled this as a myth, stating that there is no credible evidence showing that ingredients in cosmetic products disrupt hormones or pose a risk to our health. Despite this, it seems perfume has been added to the long list of questionable beauty products, and it isn’t just my friend who’s avoiding it. On TikTok, the phrase Perfume Bad For You serves up nearly 60 videos in which content creators warn their followers against wearing fragrance. Without offering solid, scientific evidence, one asserts that “fragrance is basically a word that can hide up to 3,000 chemicals within it,” while another states that perfumes are “all pretty much toxic.” A common belief is that when sprayed on the skin, these “toxic chemicals” enter the bloodstream and cause an imbalance in hormones. As you might expect, these claims have collectively racked up millions of views. But is it empty talk or a genuine cause for concern?  Perfume is meant to be a pleasure, not a source of fear, so as a self-proclaimed fragrance head, I put the question to registered toxicologist Rani Ghosh and cosmetic chemist Milan Scott — and I learned a lot. Lab-based studies that suggest fragrance ingredients can mimic hormones tend to use perfume ingredient doses far higher than what you’d ever spritz on your skin in real life. Are perfumes safe to use on the skin? Before we dive into the details, fundamentally, everything is a chemical — even water. That hasn’t stopped “clean” beauty enthusiasts from singling out a handful of perfume ingredients, though. First, phthalates, chemicals typically used to make plastics more flexible. In perfume, phthalates are often used to boost a scent’s longevity. Some common ones include diethyl phthalate (DEP) and dimethyl phthalate (DMP). Second, nitro musks, a lab-created version of natural musk.  Ghosh tells R29, “Some studies suggest [that these] fragrance ingredients may mimic hormones,” basically acting like hormones in the body, “but this isn’t the same as disrupting them.” What’s important, adds Ghosh, is that most lab-based studies tend to use perfume ingredient doses far higher than what you’d ever spritz on your skin in real life. Scott agrees, adding that it’s the dose that determines the risk: “Fragrances are usually included in formulations at under 1%, with phthalates potentially present in even smaller amounts,” she says. Scott points out that giving 100% of these ingredients to study subjects (often not humans) would clearly lead to inflated data that doesn’t match the actual concentration in perfume formulas. Since these ingredients are used in such tiny concentrations in perfumes, they’re considered safe for humans, says Ghosh. Who determines the safety of perfume ingredients? Reassuringly, Ghosh says that fragrance safety isn’t a solo mission — it’s a global collaboration: “The International Fragrance Association (IFRA) is an independent global organisation that sets rules for using fragrance ingredients safely, based on research from the non-profit group, Research Institute for Fragrance Materials (RIFM).” This institute conducts safety assessments, which are then reviewed by an additional independent expert panel for fragrance safety. Their deep dive covers substances that can harm fertility or the development of an unborn child, as well as other health concerns such as skin irritation, sensitization, and carcinogenicity (the ability to cause cancer).  Ghosh explains that the International Fragrance Association takes all this data and creates its globally recognized standards: “These ban or restrict certain ingredients to ensure consumer safety,” says Ghosh. In fact, a handful of perfume ingredients flagged as risky — like certain phthalates — have already been restricted or banned in many countries, says Ghosh. “With 80% of global fragrances complying, it’s one of beauty’s most robust safety nets,” she adds. “This means you can trust that big brands are sourcing fragrances designed with your safety in mind.” ‘When brands purchase fragrances, they’re already compliant with the latest science,’ says registered toxicologist Rani Ghosh. With that in mind, you’re most certainly already using safe perfumes. Are all perfume brands safe to use? Ghosh says that you can rest assured that the top fragrance houses, which supply perfume blends to cosmetics manufacturers, all adhere to these standards: “When brands purchase fragrances, they’re already compliant with the latest science,” she explains. With that in mind, you’re most certainly already using safe perfumes. If you live in the US, there’s an extra safety net, says Scott. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is beginning to tighten up its regulations with the introduction of the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act. “This requires brands to identify any fragrance allergens in the ingredient declaration,” says Scott, but she adds that ingredients used in cosmetics have always been required to be safe for the intended use. Can perfume be absorbed into the body and disrupt your hormones? Besides those regulatory bodies keeping an eye on things, Ghosh points out that your skin is pretty great at shielding you from most chemicals, including fragrances. She mentions the 500 Dalton rule, a guideline in cosmetic and skincare formulation that relates to how ingredients are absorbed through the skin. “According to this rule, molecules larger than 500 daltons struggle to penetrate the skin barrier — and most fragrance ingredients fall into this category,” says Ghosh. “This means they stay on the surface where they belong rather than entering your bloodstream in significant amounts.” Considering that perfume is applied topically, rather than ingested or injected, this greatly limits your exposure, confirms Scott: “A healthy skin barrier does a great job at keeping things out of our systems,” she says. Cosmetics regulators aren’t just looking at one bottle on your shelf — they’re thinking about the big picture, accounting for “aggregate exposure,” says Ghosh, which is much of a chemical you’re exposed to across all products you use. “Even if you use over 12 fragranced products daily, these [regulations] ensure you stay well below any risk thresholds thanks to conservative limits,” she says.  Natural or essential oil-based fragrances aren’t inherently safer. Essential oils, like citrus oils, are particularly highly concentrated and can contain allergens and irritants.Rani Ghosh, registered toxicologist Do certain perfumes pose more of a risk than others? Out of the thousands of ingredients that make a perfume, only a small handful ever raise eyebrows, says Ghosh. “Those ingredients are tightly controlled or replaced with safer alternatives, and while social media might amplify these risks, evidence-based regulation ensures your perfume is safe without the drama.” So while TikTok might be in a panic, your signature scent, as long as it’s from a reputable brand, is in the clear. Are natural or essential oil perfumes better for you? If TikTok is anything to go by, “natural” or essential oil-based perfumes are better for you than those containing chemicals like phthalates. But the experts say that this is a huge misconception: “Natural or essential oil-based fragrances aren’t inherently safer,” says Ghosh. Essential oils, like citrus oils, are particularly highly concentrated and can contain allergens and irritants. “These can cause [skin] reactions in sunlight,” explains Ghosh, like redness, burning, blistering, and, eventually, hyperpigmentation.  Unlike lab-made perfume ingredients, natural oils are a bit unpredictable and can vary wildly in composition, which makes them trickier to control for safety. The bottom line? Whether an ingredient is natural or synthetic, what matters is a smart formulation and solid regulation, not where it came from. Can you still use your perfume? Unlike the often boldly displayed cruelty-free symbol, perfumes don’t usually highlight that they’re IFRA compliant, says Ghosh, but she’s all for celebrating fragrance as a form of joy and self-expression: “Don’t let fear take that away!” she stresses. “Rest assured that decades of research and regulation have gone into ensuring your favorite scents are both indulgent and safe to use daily.” If you’re still concerned, Ghosh advises applying your perfume sparingly or focusing on your pulse points. “But know the science has been taken care of,” she reassures.
