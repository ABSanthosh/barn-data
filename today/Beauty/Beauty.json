    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/scarlett-johansson-beauty-interview-49403094",
    "description": "Scarlett Johansson is on a mission to \"feed\" your natural beauty. That is by no means the easiest of tasks, but it lies at the heart of her beauty brand, The Outset, and functions as a \"huge source of pride\" for her each and every day. It also resonates with Johansson on a profoundly personal level. Having experienced her own \"debilitating\" acne struggles, \"The Avengers\" star knows exactly what damage skin-care issues can do to your self-confidence. \"As somebody who has had acne, I understand how debilitating that can be,\" she says while discussing the launch of her brand's new Lip Oasis Glossy Treatment ($28). \"It really can be something that takes over your whole thought process and makes you feel so self-conscious about yourself. And then that affects how you carry yourself throughout the day.\" For Johansson, conquering her acne came down to adopting one very simple but \"life-changing\" skin-care habit: Paring back her routine to focus on gentle, restorative essentials. \"It was an important part of my desire to create everyday essentials and pare back the stress that's now come from the 14-step skin-care routine,\" she says. \"It's a lot. People spend time on self-care, which is awesome, but it also feels overwhelming to me. That paring [back], to me, it was life-changing.\" So effective was this scaled-back regimen that Johansson says she rarely steps away from it - because she knows what harm can be done by deviating from the products that she knows work well on her \"sensitive\" skin. \"When you have sensitive skin and something is working, you just use those products. I don't use anything else. I get sent a lot of products, too, which is awesome, but all my girlfriends benefit from that because I'm like, 'I'm good, I don't want to break out.'\" The importance of using clean, potent products that work to repair the skin is a lesson that Johansson is already teaching her 10-year-old daughter, Rose, who she admits is already something of a budding skin care guru. Despite her tender age, Rose, like so many other youngsters, has already developed a passion for beauty - a passion that her mom is happy to encourage, but only in the right way. \"My daughter is 10, and it's so crazy how they're all so into skin care now,\" she says. \"She'll go on a trip to a cosmetics store, and I have to pull all the actives out of her hands.\" \"My daughter is 10, and it's so crazy how they're all so into skin care now. She'll go on a trip to a cosmetics store, and I have to pull all the actives out of her hands.\" That determination to only use clean, healing ingredients (including a botanical alternative to hyaluronic acid sourced from Cassia seeds) poses challenges for Johansson as she endeavors to craft efficacious formulas for The Outset. In fact, her latest product - the first intended for the lips - has been more than five years in the making because it took that long to figure out the perfect formula. \"It's difficult to get it right because we set our standards so high for ourselves in the clean category that getting something effective and clean is tricky,\" Johansson says. \"There's always going to be some sort of wax or stabilizing product that's not clean. So we went through several iterations [of the Lip Oasis].\" Described as creating a \"fuller looking pout\" without the need for filler, the product marks the brand's move toward cosmetics-style skin care, serving as both a moisturizing treatment and a gloss. \"I have painfully dry lips in the winter, and this is an answer for that,\" she says. \"And I also like to wear that glassy look, so it's a win-win. It's the best of both worlds.\" Johansson has nothing against cosmetic treatments like filler, but wants to focus instead on helping people enhance their natural beauty. \"We advocate [for people] to be the best version of yourself and feel like you're presenting your best face forward, just by having the healthiest version of your skin,\" she says. \"It's about feeding the beauty that's there. And not to judge any kind of cosmetic procedures - I think everybody does their own thing - but if we can make you feel like the best version of yourself in a way that celebrates what you come to the table with, that's great. To me, that's a huge source of pride.\" Johansson reveals that Lip Oasis is likely the first of many products that merge skin care and cosmetics, explaining that a move into color is the next big step for The Outset, as well as the launch of a body care range. \"I would love to enter into color, I think there's a lot of space for us to play in this idea of skin care as cosmetics or cosmetics as skin care,\" she says.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/dry-vs-dehydrated-skin-43861577",
    "description": "So, you're a self proclaimed skin-care afficiando? But do you know that dry skin and dehydrated skin are two different things? Though you can even have both dry and dehydrated skin at the same time, they're very different. The approach to resolving these skin-care concerns is important, as you might be using products for dry skin when it's actually dehydrated (or vice versa), which can further aggravate your skin-care woes. On top of it all, if you don't know your skin type, things can get even more complicated, especially if you're dealing with symptoms of dry skin like itchy skin. Confused yet? Don't fret, we've got your back and can help you figure out the difference between dry vs dehydrated skin in no time. Ahead, we chat with skin-care expert Emilie Montassier who breaks down all the facts and science for the best skin solutions yet, including the causes of dry skin, as well as dry skin treatment ideas. You'll be all caught up on your skin-care knowledge in no time, and all you have to do is keep scrolling. Experts Featured in This Article Emilie Montassier is a skin-care expert for Bioderma, as well as a medical science liaison for AstraZeneca. Dry vs. Dehydrated Skin The main difference between dry skin and dehydrated skin is that dry skin is a skin type, whereas dehydrated skin is a temporary state. Dry skin is a skin type much like oily or combination skin, that is caused by a lack of lipids. Montassier tells PS that the \"main issue here is that the skin barrier is impaired,\" meaning the lipid levels are lacking, causing severe dryness (not an ideal skin situation). \"Dry skin can be dehydrated, whereas dehydrated skin is not necessarily dry but could also be oily or combination\" Montassier says. Dehydrated skin is very different, noting that \"we can't consider dehydrated skin as a skin type but more as a temporary state,\" because it lacks water both internally and externally. Dehydrated skin is \"a very common problem affecting all genders and skin types.\" Causes of Dry or Dehydrated Skin Causes of Dry Skin As previously mentioned, dry skin is caused by a loss of lipids due to a problem with the skin's barrier so \"the skin loses more water than usual and also becomes dehydrated.\" Dry skin can be worsened by using the wrong skin care; likewise, not using any skin care at all can have a big impact on your skin health. Additionally, hormonal changes can also wreak havoc on the skin. Genetics can play a role in skin types too; some people are prone to dry skin more than others. Causes of Dehydrated Skin Dehydrated skin is caused by a \"mix of internal and external factors such as environment (wind and cold), social factors (smoking and alcohol), and emotional factors (stress).\" Montassier suggests keeping your showers at a reasonable heat and the central heating down. (Luckily, both your bank account and skin will thank you for it.) Another main factor contributing to dehydrated skin is lack of hydration inside the body due to not drinking enough water. We're well aware that it is the most overused skin care tip but it still ranks as the most important. Your skin needs internal hydration to externally benefit from it. Symptoms of Dry vs. Dehydrated Skin Dry and dehydrated skin are different, and therefore, they present different symptoms. Keep reading to learn more about each one. Symptoms of Dry Skin There are many different causes of dry skin, some more common than others. \"Dry skin suffers from possible itching, discomfort, scales, roughness, and even cracks in the skin,\" Montassier says. Those dealing with dry skin may also find that it is irritated easily, even from the most gentle products. Symptoms of Dehydrated Skin On the other hand, Montassier highlights that dehydrated skin symptoms often leave the skin in a state of \"tightness, discomfort, loss of radiance, increased facial lines, and cause trouble for biological functions such as the body's healing process.\" You may also find that your skin feels dehydrated but can also look oily, and you may still get breakouts despite the tight feeling. You might also find that your makeup becomes patchy throughout the day. One way to test whether or not your skin is dehydrated is to do what is called a \"pinch test.\" You can pinch a small amount of skin between two fingers, and see how long it takes for the skin to snap back into place. If it moves back into place quickly and easily, you likely aren't dealing with dehydrated skin. Skin Care Products For Dry or Dehydrated Skin If you're looking for dry skin treatment, there are specific skin-care ingredients that help with dry and dehydrated skin. Some ingredients that help with both include hyaluronic acid and ceramdies. Glycerin, snail mucin, and lactic acid help with dehydrated skin, while plant oils, seed oils, and shea butter help with dry skin. Some products we like with these ingredients are the Amlactin Daily Moisturizing Lotion ($14) and the Gold Bond Radiance and Renewal Body Cream ($6). Fore more suggestions, read our full round-up of hydrating body products. Montassier also suggests finding a product with lipids, which can help rehydrate the skin. She recommends using a \"daily gentle cleanser that increases lipid levels, like the Atoderm Shower Gel ($22).\" - Additional reporting by Renee Rodriguez Tori Crowther is a freelance beauty journalist and former PS UK editor.

I don’t pretend to be particularly gifted at styling my own hair, so I’m constantly on the hunt for an all-in-one tool that is easy to use and achieves the result I’m looking for: smooth, soft waves with body and movement. Prior to releasing the FlexStyle, Shark was perhaps best known for vacuums and Shark Ninja kitchen gadgets. But now that the multi-functional hair tool (which is widely viewed as the biggest rival to the Dyson Airwrap) has amassed a legion of loyal fans, the brand is uniquely positioned to make some waves (literally) as it continues to build out its hair tool assortment.  It’s time to see if lightning can strike twice for Shark with its eagerly-awaited sophomore launch, the FlexFusion. The bar was set high, but if anyone can rise to the challenge, it’s Shark. Keep reading for our full review of the highly-anticipated new beauty tool. What’s new about the FlexFusion? We’ll get right into it: The biggest thing that sets the new FlexFusion from the beloved FlexStyle is that it’s a true wet-to-dry styler that takes your hair from post-shower to bouncy blowout (with the help of a few attachments, of course). Additionally, the new tool is more powerful, yet more compact and lighter than the FlexStyle, making it more travel-friendly (and easy on your muscles) than other stylers on the market. Shark FlexFusion Air \u0026 Ceramic System with Air Straightener, $399.99 What’s in the box? There are a couple versions of the tool to choose from, depending on your hair type and texture:  First, there’s the Wet-or-Dry FlexFusion Air \u0026 Ceramic System with Air Straightener, which comes with a flatiron-inspired attachment head to dry and smooth hair in a matter of passes. (For reference, it’s comparable to the Dyson Airstrait.) Next, there’s the Wet-or-Dry FlexFusion Air \u0026 Ceramic System, which adds volume and body while drying your hair. Both versions come with the Fusion brush attachment (a volumizing round brush that also dries and smooths), 1.25-inch curling barrels (which work similarly to the FlexStyle ones) plus a concentrator nozzle that you can add if you’re using the FlexFusion as a hair dryer. You can also customize your own bundle online so you can get exactly what you need in terms of styling attachments, and nothing you don’t. (BTW, the FlexStyle attachments are not compatible with the FlexFusion base, and vice versa.) What styles can you achieve with the FlexFusion? I have fine, thick hair with a slight wave pattern, and was able to achieve a wide range of looks with the FlexFusion. The first time I used it on freshly-washed hair by twisting the FlexFusion into its angled dryer shape and rough-drying to remove excess water. Then, I straightened the tool, popped the Fusion Brush on, and brushed from the underside of my length to dry while adding volume. The result was a smooth, natural-looking blowout with plenty of volume (but not like, “big Texas hair” volume.) If you’ve used a tool like the internet-famous Revlon heated brush, you will love Shark’s version. I have a ton of hair and could still do my whole head in less than 10 minutes. Even on the highest heat and air settings, it felt pretty gentle on my head. (There’s also a Scalp Shield mode that automatically adjusts temperature to protect your scalp from heat damage.) From there, I added a little bit of texture spray for some light hold, and boom: I looked like I left the salon.  The next time I washed my hair, I rough-dried and used the Straightener attachment to get a sleeker style. Again, as someone who usually waits hours for my hair to completely air-dry, the speed with which this works is pretty impressive. I am an Airstrait apologist, but even I had to admit that this one worked just as well, if not better, to smooth and dry damp hair in a matter of passes. Can it be used on dry hair? On dry hair, I refreshed a two-day blowout with the curl barrels. I’ll be totally honest: These are not my favorite. I’ve owned my Airwrap for years, and the curl attachments are starting to collect dust because I use them so infrequently. (I am team paddle or round brush attachment.) While they may be gentler on hair, I vastly prefer the ease and precision of a curling iron for achieving loose, beachy waves. (I also like to leave my ends out for more of a cool-girl vibe, and I find that hard to do with both my Airwrap and Shark.) If you’ve used the Airwrap or FlexStyle to curl your hair, it’s basically the same thing with the FlexFusion. If you haven’t, there’s a bit of a learning curve. Unlike the new Airwrap (which has multi-directional barrels), the Shark curlers go in one direction, meaning you’ll have to switch halfway through for each side of your head if you want your curls to sweep away from your face. From there, take small sections of hair and carefully feed it into the top-to-middle of the barrel, slowly moving the tool upwards to “catch” the remainder of the length as it wraps around the rest of the barrel. I used low heat and low air because the stronger the air was, the more I found that it would blow other sections of my hair around it while I was wielding the tool, resulting in a messy, bedhead look. DashDividers_1_500x100 Is the FlexFusion worth it? Depending on the bundle and attachments you choose, the Shark FlexFusion retails from $329.99 to $399.99. It’s still expensive, to be sure — but definitely more palatable than the $600 Dyson Airwrap from purely a cost perspective. I have to say, few tools work as well as this one in terms of versatility; whether you’re looking for straight and sleek or bouncy, Farrah Fawcett curls, the FlexFusion can get it done. All in all, I’m very impressed — and personally won’t be surprised if I see the nifty new gadget topping wish lists this holiday season. Like what you see?

    "description": "Fall has only just arrived, but that doesn’t mean we’re not already looking ahead to what this year’s holiday season will have to offer. (That is, if you’ve been good this year.) And while it may feel early — after all, Halloween is two months away — that hasn’t deterred brands from releasing some of their big-ticket holiday items. Case in point: Beauty-stuffed advent calendars.While these blockbuster sets usually come at a premium price point, that's for a few reasons: They tend to be limited in quantity, feature exquisite packaging, and contain myriad products, including full sizes or limited-edition shades. All that's to say that the beauty-filled advent calendars you'll find here are not only marvelous to ooh and aah at but also provide a surprisingly good value, given the ample contents inside. (Pro tip: Find a buddy to go halfsies with and divide the spoils.) And while advent calendars are inherently an exercise in patience, we won't tell if you open up all the teeny-tiny doors the day it arrives on your doorstep...At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.
