    "description": "In today’s crowded perfume scene, it takes something truly extraordinary to make our beauty editors sit up and take notice. This is especially true for spring and summer perfumes, when brands jostle for attention with new releases that promise to transport you to warmer climes and lift your mood. Given the current status of the world, I’m skeptical about perfumes that aim to spark joy. But when I heard about Noyz Detour Eau de Parfum, $85, a scent that claims to capture “the warm and happy memories of a road trip”, I was a little more than curious. If you’re a Refinery29 regular, you’re probably already aware of our love for Noyz, an LA-based fragrance brand with cool girl status. Renowned perfumer Jérôme Epinette, who has worked on bestselling perfumes for the likes of Byredo and Floral Street, is the creator behind the collection. Our beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita is already a big fan: “My bathroom shelf is chock-full of fragrances, but I’ll always make room for Noyz,” she says. “The brand oozes cool, and its note combinations are so unique; Unmute Eau de Parfum, $85, for example, is like no other vanilla scent I’ve tried.” Detour, the brand’s latest drop, is another variation of that vanilla-heavy, “skin musk” perfume trend we’ve been seeing everywhere. But we actually think this has serious potential to stand out and emerge as the viral scent of the summer. Keep reading to learn the stamps of approval from two picky Refinery29 editors. DashDividers_1_500x100 Noyz Detour Eau De Parfum, $85 Call me a Debbie Downer, but “happy” olfactory notes don’t usually do it for me. Most gourmands — fragrances with sweet, edible notes — smell more cloying than comforting to my nose, and I tend to get sick of floral scents after a few wears. Meanwhile, citrus notes remind me of cleaning products. Admittedly, I wasn’t too convinced that I’d like Detour, which features all three components. But it proved me wrong. In fact, I fell in love with Detour at first spritz thanks to its bold initial blast: I could smell a burst of white florals, namely creamy jasmine and powdery gardenia, but it’s balanced out by equally powerful whiffs of crisp apple blossom and Spanish mandarin. This bright and juicy combination lingered in the air around me, and made me think of that first breath of summer air when you roll down your car windows. This was precisely Epinette’s intention. I couldn’t help but smile as fun memories of past summer road trips washed over me. Kilikita was also impressed by the scent’s incredible projection: “Just one spritz on my left wrist was enough to garner multiple compliments from friends on a recent night out,” she says, adding, “The staying power is akin to a perfume extrait, which boasts a larger concentration of fragrance oil.” This makes sense given the emerging perfume trend of pairing citrus with musk, which prolongs the wear time of a scent. As Detour settles, it transforms into something more intimate, with skin-wrapped musk and warm, comforting vanilla. Kikilita caught subtle hints of tobacco, coffee, and dried flowers, while it smelled more like caramel toffee to me. It has a warm, lived-in feeling that doesn’t try too hard to be “sexy” but rather, invites people to lean in closer. I’ve been wearing the perfume for a week straight and haven’t been able to stop sniffing my wrists. Ever better is how it changes throughout the day, gradually transforming from an invigorating citrus-floral bomb at the start of the day to a cozy, skin-like scent by nighttime. As someone who gets bored of a fragrance easily, this is such a blessing. This unique shapeshifting quality convinced us that Detour will be the cool girl’s scent of the summer. In fact, it has already generated lots of buzz since making its debut at none other than Coachella. It certainly has a fun and energetic burst that bodes well for festival season, while the creamy and musky dry down brings a slice of nostalgia for summer’s past. Personally, I can’t wait to break this out for my upcoming summer vacay, and will definitely be wearing this when I need a timely reminder of more carefree days. Like what you see?

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. Following the last six months of industry musical chairs, another wave took place in March when it was announced that three major fashion houses were undergoing changes: Demna leaving Balenciaga to become Gucci’s new artistic director, Donatella Versace stepping down as creative director of her namesake legacy brand and Jonathan Anderson leaving Loewe after 11 years at its helm. But career changes weren’t the only headline-worthy fashion moments in March, with Paris Fashion Week providing plenty of moments that stopped the internet. Chappell Roan stepped straight from the 2025 Grammy Awards into the Rick Owens show wearing an alien-inspired, dotted face paint look complete with white contacts. Doechii made her fashion week debut with a gravity-defying blowdry at Schiaparelli, not to mention a frosted green eyeshadow look and black-lined lips for the Acne FROW. Plus, Gigi Hadid made a case for the “silver tequila” bob at the Le Grand Dîner du Louvre. For those on the hunt for even more fashion and beauty inspiration, you’ll be glad to know that April has a slew of exciting releases, launches, and products heading your way. Read ahead to take a look at all the best fashion and beauty bits coming this month.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

This time, the brand tapped Devon Lee Carlson to design the new collection. The standout looks of the 20-piece collection include a chocolate polka dot mini dress, a '90s-inspired sky blue co-ord complete with a matching neck scarf, and a backless black lace knit dress — all made using materials like organic cotton and deadstock fabrics.Shop now at ReformationReformation x Devon Lee Carlson Cher Dress, $, available at ReformationOld Navy Launches Special-Occasion Dresses This spring and summer, Old Navy wants you to get dressed up — literally.

With prices ranging from $44.99 to $64.99, the capsule features elegant twist-front maxi dresses, sleek cowl-neck satin gowns, joyful bubble-hem mini dresses, all of which are available in sizes XS to 4X (or 0 to 30). “I’ve designed dresses for women in every scenario — from everyday moments to the red carpet — so it was a pleasure to lend my expertise to Sarah [Holme, Old Navy head of design and product development] and collaborate with the Old Navy design team on The Occasion,” chief creative officer Zac Posen said in a press release. “This collection is elevated, accessible, and truly makes any event feel special.” Shop now at Old Navy Old Navy Satin Cowl Maxi Dress, $, available at Old NavyCoach Becomes Official Partner of the WNBA Professional women’s basketball just got even more stylish because Coach is now an official partner of the WNBA. The deal — which, according to a press release, is meant to encourage players and fans to embrace and express all aspects of their personalities — will pop up in different ways throughout the 2025 season. That includes the WNBA Draft, which was held in New York City on April 14 and saw top prospects like Paige Bueckers (the first overall pick), Hailey Van Lith, and Aneesah Morrow sporting Coach at the event. Another aspect of the partnership? Coach will become the presenting sponsor of WNBA Pride, a platform celebrating the LGBTQ+ community.

Jones Road (created by makeup artist Bobbi Brown) is on the case with the launch of the new Just Enough Tinted Moisturizer. Designed to conceal redness and even out the skin tone with light coverage, this product is ideal for those who don’t like to wear a lot of makeup. The silky formula minimizes the appearance of redness and hyperpigmentation without a mask-like finish and provides just enough tint for minimal makeup days. Shop now at Jones Road BeautyJones Road Just Enough Tinted Moisturizer, $, available at Jones RoadCult Gaia Introduces Bridal Collection The brand behind the viral Ark bag and Cassidy Sandal — and the latest Gap collaborator — Cult Gaia is walking down the aisle. The LA brand has just launched its debut bridal collection, and it’s full of sculptural, statement-making styles that break the typical wedding-day mold — think a mini dress made from silk-chiffon braided material, a floral-lace gown with removable sleeves, a plisséd 3-D top, and more. “Crafted for the effortless bride, each piece is thoughtfully created to captivate, inspire, and evoke pure emotion on your most special days,” Cult Gaia founder Jasmin Larian Hekmat said in a press release.

The latest edition of the brand’s more luxurious, atelier-focused line is made up of cherry reds, blossom pinks, and pieces covered in whimsical heart, lip, and bow motifs. Find a cropped white button-front shirt with beaded detailing on the collar, wide-leg pleated trousers with delicate ties on the leg, a warm-weather-ready maxi dress with sequinned embellishments, and so much more. Shop on April 10 at \u0026 Other Stories The Ordinary Multi-Antioxidant Radiance SerumAntioxidants (think vitamin C) can offer a neutralizing and protective effect against free radicals like UV and pollution, keeping skin bright, bouncy, and smooth. But while one antioxidant is a great start, The Ordinary is now bringing eight key antioxidant ingredients together in its new Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum. Here’s why it’s beneficial: Our skin is consistently exposed to the aforementioned environmental aggressors, and these free radicals build up and lead to fine lines, dullness, and uneven skin tone. This serum works hard to prevent that from happening — and our beauty director is already a big fan.Shop now at The Ordinary and SephoraThe Ordinary Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum, $, available at SephoraBarbour x CrocsBarbour might be best known for being a favorite of the British Royal Family, but this spring, the heritage label is stepping into a more casual territory, announcing a collaboration with functional footwear brand Crocs. The limited-edition collection contains a wax jacket, two footwear styles in a tartan graphic print, and nine Jibbitz charms, bringing together the playfulness of Crocs and the practicality of Barbour.

Since then, the tech giant has dominated the hair space with the Coralle straightener and the highly coveted Airwrap multi-styler. Recently, the company announced that its professional Supersonic r™ hair dryer will soon be available to the public, having previously only been exclusive to salons and hairstylists. To mark the occasion, you can buy the curve-nozzled dryer in a pearly pink colorway (with a purple gemstone shade available in the summer). The Supersonic r™ is Dyson’s lightest and most powerful hairdryer, offering easier maneuverability in comparison to the original model, as well as specific attachments for straight, wavy, curly and coily hair types.Shop now at Dyson Dyson Supersonic r™ hair dryer, $, available at DysonNomasei Debuts First Stiletto HeelsParis-based footwear brand Nomasei is the label behind the fashion crowd’s favorite stylish (and comfy!) loafer, but it’s not stopping there. For the first time ever, the brand debuted stiletto heels: the Gattaca ($595), a streamlined slingback pump available in embossed white and black patent leathers, and the Before Sunrise ($651), an open-toed sandal with ankle straps also available in embossed black and white leather. According to the press release, Nomasei co-founder Paule Tenaillon was inspired by her years designing classic tango heels in Buenos Aires, where comfort and wearability were all-important. As a result, both styles (which were named for the cult ’90s films) also emphasize arch support and memory foam.

Luckily, Sol de Janeiro is launching three fragrances this month, each with its own distinct Powerpuff Girl-esque personality. Flor Mística is spring in a bottle, thanks to notes of orange blossom, flamingo flower, and Brazilian gardenia. Água Mística is for fans of something fresh, with notes of neroli water, salty skin, and tangerine, while Dança Mística is made for the dance floor, with hints of purple fig, warm vanilla, sandalwood, and lily of the valley. Plus, the set comes with a Scent Menu —  tips on how to layer the fragrances to create your own unique combination. Shop now at Sol de JaneiroSol de Janeiro Limited Edition Perfume Mist Trio, $, available at Sol de JaneiroSANDRO x Louise BourgeoisFor the artistic among us, the announcement of Sandro’s latest collection will be joyous news to the ears. Taking inspiration from French-American artist Louise Bourgeois, the spring collection features geometric patterns. In particular, spirals feature heavily in the collection, inspired in part by the artist’s famous “Spider” sculpture. Boasting Mediterranean blues and oat milk neutrals, the collection features linen dresses, silky trousers, and cotton poplin pants — a perfect spring wardrobe.Shop on April 9 at SandroColorwow Texas Hold’em Big Hold Hairspray Colorwow's Texas Hold'em Hairspray is a perfect paradox — it delivers a strong hold yet feels like the lightest hairspray you've ever tried. It kept our beauty director’s waves intact throughout an entire day, an eight-hour night flight, and a lengthy layover in an airport, making it feel almost a shame to wash out. Even better? It offers additional heat and UV protection, shields against frizz-inducing humidity, and brushes out with ease, leaving hair feeling soft and silky, not crispy or chalky.

Whether you’ve previously recurred a pair of Simone Rocha beaded drop earrings or a corseted Mugler dress, the collaborations offer a chance to enter the world of luxury at a much sweeter price point. For the latest collection, the Swedish giant has turned to Polish designer Magda Butrym, who has dubbed the 19-piece collection a “celebration of femininity in bloom.” From denim bustiers with 3D rose adornments to shimmering gowns with glittering floral embellishments, this collection is made for spring soirees.Shop on April 24 at H\u0026MLike what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/difference-between-eczema-psoriasis-48434359",
    "description": "While certain skin conditions such as acne can seem easy to diagnose from home, others can be a bit trickier, like eczema and psoriasis. These two skin conditions, which usually present themselves in the form of a rash on the skin, are fairly common but very difficult to distinguish between. Eczema, otherwise known as atopic dermatitis, is an itchy inflammation of the skin and usually appears in children and can continue to adulthood; psoriasis is a chronic condition that causes a buildup of scaly, dry patches on the skin, affecting areas like your scalp, elbows, knees, neck, and even your nails. While they can appear similar to the untrained eye, they're two very different conditions and therefore, should be treated accordingly. To help you better understand what you're dealing with, we asked two doctors to explain the difference between psoriasis and eczema ahead. Experts Featured in This Article Elroy Vojdani, MD, IFMCP, is a functional medicine pioneer. Dhaval Bhanusali, MD, is a board-certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist. What's the Difference Between Eczema and Psoriasis? \"Eczema is a general inflammatory skin condition and psoriasis is a specific autoimmune skin condition,\" functional medicine pioneer Elroy Vojdani, MD, IFMCP, says. The main difference between the two is the cause. \"Psoriasis is thought to occur due to immune dysregulation,\" says board-certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist Dhaval Bhanusali, MD. This is when the immune system attacks the body thinking it's a virus or bacteria. \"Whereas eczema has a host of reasons that may cause it, including genetic mutations and environmental factors,\" he says. How to Tell the Difference Between Eczema and Psoriasis The symptoms of eczema and psoriasis are very similar, which is what makes it so hard to tell the two apart, but there are a few minor distinguishing characteristics. \"Psoriasis will go on the outer portion of a joint, so that's on the elbow itself or the top of the knees,\" says Dr. Vojdani. Dr. Bhanusali adds: \"[It] presents as thick scaly plaques that are sometimes itchy.\" Eczema, on the other hand, usually appears in the crease of joints, like behind the knees, in the bend of the neck, in armpits, and on eyelids. \"Eczema tends to present as pinkish patches,\" says Dr. Bhanusali. What Triggers Eczema vs. Psoriasis? The triggers of eczema and psoriasis are nearly identical. Genetics, foods, medications, and stress levels can cause the skin conditions to flare up but it varies from person to person. \"For eczema, often environmental factors, like weather [and] cosmetic products can trigger symptoms,\" says Dr. Bhanusali. According to Dr. Vojdani, foods with large amounts of histamine, such as strawberries, are another common eczema trigger. How Are Eczema and Psoriasis Treated? Because eczema is an inflammatory condition, it's easier to treat than psoriasis. \"Whereas, when someone develops an autoimmune condition like psoriasis, they are much more difficult to treat, and they cannot be reversed,\" says Dr. Vojdani. \"They can only be placed into remission.\" But that doesn't mean there's no hope for those diagnosed with it. \"Both can be treated with topical steroids like triamcinolone or clobetasol,\" says Dr. Bhanusali. \"If systemic symptoms occur, which is more common in psoriasis, we can add biologic medications.\" This is an advanced medication or injection that interrupts the immune system's natural response. There are additional ways to manage psoriasis and eczema at home. This includes avoiding known triggers as much as possible, moisturizing the skin regularly, using a humidifier to keep the air in your home from getting too dry, and avoiding hot water showers or baths. Many people also find success in switching to fragrance-free, sensitive skin-safe products formulated with ingredients like ceramides. When flare-ups do occur, over-the-counter hydrocortisone can be used to alleviate irritation and itchiness. \"In the functional medicine space, we put patients on anti-inflammatory diets like a paleo diet and also reduce the consumption of high histamine-containing foods and support the gut environment with probiotics,\" says Dr. Vojdani. To determine if you have eczema vs. psoriasis once and for all, and to get the best, most effective treatment, it's always best to see your doctor or dermatologist.

    "title": "I Was Giving \"Conservative Girl\" Makeup - Here's How I Fixed It",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/conservative-makeup-transformation-49438025",
    "description": "As I watched Suzanne Lambert's now-viral video \"doing makeup like the gorg MAGA girls,\" I started to cringe. With each passing observation - not doing any skin prep so that makeup \"clings\" to dry spots, not using contour or bronzer for a \"matte and flat\" look, applying blush too low, so \"it kind of looks like everything is drooping\" - I cringed harder. While I'm strongly not in support of anything MAGA-related, I'm guilty of a lot of the things Lambert pointed out. I felt ashamed, embarrassed, and deflated - and like I needed to start wearing a sign when I went out that reads \"I'm not MAGA, I just don't know how to do my makeup.\" I like wearing a little glam, but it's never been a serious interest of mine. I wasn't the girl to steal her mom's lipstick growing up or to use my babysitting money on a haul of drugstore products to try. I've leaned on makeup artists in department stores to refresh my look every couple of years and just blindly accepted their advice, as I get overwhelmed walking into Sephora or trying to pick a YouTube makeup video tutorial. Determined to remove any trace of the \"conservative girl\" makeup trend, I reached out to Samara Perchick, a local makeup artist I'd seen on Instagram, for help. Perchick runs what she calls her Natural Glow Academy, a two-hour session meant to help people learn how to apply natural-looking makeup properly. She listened as I walked her through my current routine and product lineup. The verdict? She confirmed (very nicely and gently, I might add) the mistakes I knew I was already making, like using a foundation that was too yellow for my skin tone and mascara that is definitely dry. After that, Perchick got to work, walking me through each step of the process, transforming me from a mistaken MAGA girlie to someone Lambert might be proud of. She gave me a lot of tips, but here are five easy swaps she suggested that will really make a difference in your final look (just in case you, too, are afraid you've fallen victim to the ways of \"Republican\" makeup). Tip 1: A Little Concealer Does the Trick Just like in Lambert's video, I was painting my concealer on. I thought the more I used it, the better I'd be able to hide the dark circles under my eyes. But the volume I was using, combined with the fact that I was doing no skin prep with moisturizer, meant I always ended up with visible creases under my eyes. Instead, Perchick suggests making a small upside-down V-shape under the inner corner of each eye and an upward line at the outer corners. To blend, don't swipe the product all over the undereye. \"Any concealer is going to spread,\" she says. \"This area is prone to creasing, and we don't want to overload it with product.\" By just putting a bit at each corner of my eye, she showed me how I'll be able to blend the product out and still conceal the entire area without setting myself up for heavy creasing. Product used: Benefit Cosmetics Cakeless Concealer ($28) Tip 2: Contour Is a Must Before this little experiment, I had never contoured before. I'd seen videos of people using a bronzing stick but was always scared that I'd mess up the application and end up looking like I had a dirty face. \"No contour on the face is going to leave you looking just flat and unnatural,\" says Perchick, noting that if you're going to use foundation, you need to add dimension back in because \"nobody without makeup is one flat shade of color.\" Perchick recommends making a fishy face to guide the application of your contour stick, placing lines under your cheekbones, jawline, and around the forehead. I could see an instant difference in my face - it really gave me some definition instead of looking matte and flat like before. Product used: Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick in Biscuit ($26) Tip 3: Apply Blush Above Your Cheeks I really thought blush went right on the apple of your cheeks; it's something I've been doing for the past 25 years or so. I also wasn't blending my blush well, which made for a distinct block of color that didn't look very natural. Perchick refers to her blush guide as her \"Batman mask technique.\" Imagine wearing a Batman mask - that's where you want to apply your product to get a lifted effect. She starts by applying blush on the outer edge of the \"mask,\" and it's only after she's happy with the amount of coverage that she puts a \"super light\" amount on the apples. She also let me know that blush is the first thing that fades in a makeup look, so it's not a bad idea to put on slightly more blush than you think you should to account for that and to lock it in with a powder blush on top. Products used: Merit Beauty Flush Brush in Beverly Hills and Archival ($30) and Makeup by Mario SoftPop Powder Blush in Mellow Mauve ($30) Tip 4: Avoid Mascara Mishaps By Looking Down Another one of Lambert's callouts is getting mascara on your eyelids and not wiping it off - something I've definitely been a repeat offender of doing. In addition to swapping out my dry mascara (it was over a year old, oops) for something new, she also gave me a hack for avoiding this common problem. Using a handheld mirror, look down while applying your mascara. (Just a warning that the angle is absolutely horrific, but if you can stomach it, you'll be able to successfully apply mascara without getting any on your eyelids.) Product used: Maybelline Lash Sensational Sky High Waterproof Mascara ($13) Tip 5: Lip Liner Will Add Definition My 4-year-old wears more lipstick than I do and has started to call me out for leaving the house without any on. Like contouring, I've never used lip liner and I feel similarly intimidated by the idea of it. \"I always blend in the lip liner so it's not as harsh,\" Perchick says while outlining my lips. As she saw my eyes light up in fear, she told me to trust the process. \"It's not going to look right until you have lipstick on.\" And she was right. Using the liner gave my lips a bit more definition, and paired with the lipstick and gloss she chose for me, really tied together the look. Products used: Makeup by Mario Sculpting Lip Pencil in Lauren ($26), Charlotte Tilbury Hyaluronic Happikiss Lipstick Balm in Enchanting Kiss ($35), and Tower28 Beauty ShineOn Jelly Lip Gloss in Sesame ($16) My Final Thoughts My makeup routine was long overdue for an overhaul, so even though I'm still a little hurt about Lambert's sweeping generalizations, her video was the push I needed to get a makeup lesson. In the end, a few easy changes went a long way, and I have to admit, it's quite fun to play around with all of my new products. Is this what most teenage girls feel like? I test-drove my new look for my husband's birthday party, and quite a few people told me they liked my makeup despite not knowing I'd taken a lesson, which felt validating as I've never been told that before. I'm not sure I'll ever be a makeup devotee girlie, but who knows? Maybe you'll find me in a Sephora every once in a while with my newfound confidence.
