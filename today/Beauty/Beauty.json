    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/megan-thee-stallion-dreamcon-anime-cosplay?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Megan Thee Stallion was on a mission as she scanned a room full of fans at the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston: to find the best cosplaying hottie during the opening night of Dream Con. Dozens of attendees rushed to the front of the stage hoping that the costumes they spent hours—weeks and in some cases even months—putting together would catch her attention. The three-time Grammy-winning rapper hyped up a woman with an epic green wig who was dressed as Broly, a character from Dragon Ball Z. And she ran with open arms toward two other women dressed as characters from her favorite anime, My Hero Academia. Meg herself donned a purple wig and dressed as Yoruichi Shihouin from Bleach, one of the many times we’ve seen her cosplay. This time, she was greeted by thousands also in cosplay, cheering and chanting her name. “The hotties are making me feel so good! I feel right at home, babe,” she told host Storymode Bae after admitting she’d been nervous. And by “home,” she didn’t mean that solely because the convention and sold-out panel were in her hometown. After the fandom convention hosted by the popular streaming group RDCWorld announced Meg as the headliner, controversy followed. Social media users called out the organizers for engaging with posts in support of Tory Lanez. Some speculated that Meg would pull out of the convention altogether, even despite her tequila brand, Chicas Divertidas, being a sponsor. Others said the incident highlighted a broader issue: a hostile environment for Black women overall at Dream Con, where about 28,000 attendees were expected. Organizers issued an apology to the rapper on X: “We recognize that our actions contributed to a negative online environment, and we take full responsibility as we work toward fostering a more positive and respectful space.” Black women leading up to and at Friday’s panel held organizers’ feet to the fire and made sure that Meg felt celebrated and seen.  The misogynoir Meg faced isn’t unique. Black women and femmes in anime and gaming communities often face disrespect and criticism just for existing in the space. And like Meg, their balm for this hasn’t been to retreat from the hobbies they love, but rather to show up and show out. And they did just that at Dream Con 2025. Personifying their favorite heroes, villains, memes and more, Black women practiced boundless imagination and whimsical escapism. The convention also hosted numerous women-led panels. “I feel like being here is us contributing to a better culture so we can see other women that are like us like, ‘Hey girl, we see you, You don’t have to worry about the femcels and the incels and all those people who are trying to make you to be who you aren’t.’” said Bernette Fondong, a 28-year-old visiting from Atlanta. Fondong, who has been cosplaying for eight years, came dressed as Marvel’s Scarlet Witch. She attended with her friend Trisha Pilgrim, 28, from Maryland. As a nod to her queer identity, Pilgrim cosplayed as Emporio Ivankov, a gender-bending character in One Piece.  “I just really appreciate that Black women are creating that space and we’re coming out and we’re cosplaying and we’re just creating that space in spite of it all,” Pilgrim said. “We really know how to stand against adversity. I feel like we’re just making it a more accepting culture for women to feel more free in their cosplay and to show up and be here.” Even outside of the cosplay community, it’s long been considered taboo for Black people to lean into nerd culture. And though there’s been more visibility and acceptance in recent years, there are still few official spaces for Black nerds to gather en masse. For attendees experiencing their first anime convention, like Chantel Green, spaces like Dream Con attract a special energy. “My first animecon ends up being a Black anime con and it makes me really excited because Black nerds, we just weren’t seen,” said the 31-year-old from Detroit. She dressed as Persephone from Lore Olympus. “For me to come here, I feel truly blessed and I feel happy here.” Cosplay for Black women has also become an outlet for them to express their creativity with special makeup effects, stitching techniques and hairstyling. And it’s a steadily growing community. Alex Box, 28, was inspired to cosplay by her mother, a costume designer who worked on prom dresses and Princess Tiana gowns. The Houston native valued the bonding time she got to spend with her as she got guidance in making her Elphelt Valentine costume, which took four months to make.  Lanihya Duncan, a 27-year-old from Chicago who studied special effects makeup in college, got into cosplaying after her friend suggested it to her. Now at her second Dream Con, she took pride in her handmade Lulu from Final Fantasy costume, which took her two months to create. For Duncan, spaces like Dream Con allow Black weebs to not have to hide who they are. “Being Black, it can be hard for people to really show that because [of pressure to] fit in,” she said. “ But Dream Con is like no, you can be both. It’s amazing to embrace because Black cosplayers have that little umph that you can’t see. Who else is gonna be rocking braids, cornrows and afros with a Killua costume?” Gabrielle Kanu, a 35-year-old Houston native, said cosplaying feels “freeing.” Since 2016, she’s dressed as Sailor Moon, Storm and Sophie Hatter. This year, she’s Dorothy, giving a mix of The Wiz and The Wizard of Oz. “There’s no trying to codeswitch for anybody. We can be us all the time, every time. You can see the beauty and shapes of everybody around here. I’m a little plump and I’m glad I am and you see everyone else who’s glad of who they are,” she said “It’s kind of like being at an HBCU. It’s literally like a homecoming.” @_tarynitup Meg teased a new anime she’s making at #DreamCon ♬ original sound – Taryn Finley During Friday’s event, Meg also announced that she’s making an anime with Prime Video. Though she didn’t go into the details, she revealed that she collaborated with Boondocks producer and voice actor Carl Jones to create it. This marks a major stride for Black women behind the scenes in anime and opens up the genre for newcomers to dip their toe in. While it’s not on Black women to fix the sexism, homophobia and transphobia they encounter in alternative spaces — or in any spaces for that matter — there’s an intrinsic power we possess in showing up as we are in these types of spaces. For Meg, the public has witnessed her do that time and time again. “My proudest achievement is staying strong through adversity. I feel like a lot of people in my shoes would have gave up,” she said during the Q\u0026A. “The Hotties have my back.” Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glossier-katseye-collaboration-lip-oil-glaze?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Glossier is a brand that has its finger firmly on the pulse. It pioneered the minimalist, “your skin, but better” look that has dominated the beauty trend cycle for years. There’s also the cult-favorite You perfume, an intimate, musky fragrance that ignited the demand for skin-like scents. And, who can forget when the brand tapped a then up-and-coming Olivia Rodrigo as its first-ever celebrity spokesperson? So when we caught wind that the brand teamed up with pop girl group Katseye for the launch of its new product, a cooling lip oil named Lip Glaze, $22, we immediately knew that this was newsworthy on all fronts. If you haven’t heard of Katseye, start taking notes now: the rising girl group of the moment is poised to become the Spice Girls of the social media age. Its six members — Sophia Laforteza, Lara Raj, Meret Manon Bannerman, Daniela Avanzini, Megan Skiendiel, and Yoonchae Jeung — hail from all over the world, after successfully competing in Netflix’s Pop Star Academy, a K-pop style survival talent show. The group’s newest release, a campy earworm of a club banger named “Gnarly“, has entered the Billboard Hot 100 and Spotify Global Charts. Off the success of the group’s latest single and the launch of Lip Glaze, we talked all things beauty with Katseye, from their secret skincare habits to the Glossier products they never go without. DashDividers_1_500x100 R29: How do you personally define the word “gnarly”? From the lyrics of your new single, it feels open to so many interpretations. Sophia Laforteza: A recent slang word that I’ve been using a lot is “ew”. You know how when people think of the word “ew”, they think it’s gross and disgusting? But I’ve been using it when something absolutely eats, like when someone’s blush looks amazing. That eventually turned into using the word “gnarly” to describe something that looks really good. There’s a duality to “gnarly”; you can definitely use it in a good way and in a bad way. R29: How are you finding the response to “Gnarly”? There were lots of extreme reactions and memes at first, but the song has really caught on. Lara Raj: It’s been overwhelming and exciting. To be so real with you, people were really jarred by the song at first, so that was pretty hard for us. But [the turnaround in fan opinion] happened in the span of one day, when we did our first live performance in Korea. I think that because “Gnarly” is such a talking song, the visual part of the performance is something that the song needs. It’s definitely been a rollercoaster for us, but we also understood the fans’ perspective: when we first heard the song, we were like, “Wow, this is so different!”, and it’s something that gags you a little bit. We’re so grateful to see how many people are loving it now and the success that it’s bringing to us. R29: Let’s chat a bit more about beauty. In your GRWM video with Glossier, Manon talked about her love for shaved brows. Do you have any tips on how to do this perfectly? Meret Manon Bannerman: I just love the straight brow look; it makes my face look snatched and more awake. Here’s what I do: I shave off the top edge of my brow [where there’s typically a natural arch] and I use a brow pencil to draw on the ends, so it looks more straight. PSA: You have to be very careful, or they might not end up looking good. But my members have all done it and they all look amazing, so I honestly feel like everyone should try having straight brows. R29: Since you spend so much time together, what are some cool beauty tips you’ve picked up from each other? SL: Lara loves using her eyeliner pencil as a lip liner. LR: Yeah, it’s because it stays on so much longer than regular lip products. I’m obsessed with Glossier’s No. 1 Pencil, $18, in the shade Frame. It’s a neutral dark brown that looks kind of ashy. I love to overline my lips with it and sometimes use it to draw freckles, too. I also put mascara on my eyebrows: it’s literally a brush that has color on it, and it works so well for brushing your brows. Another tip I have is to use highlighter as my eye shadow. I have naturally darker eyelids, so highlighter tends to brighten them up. R29: Blush is having such a big moment. What are some of your favourite blush placements? Daniela Avanzini: Surprisingly, I don’t really use blush. I apply bronzer as my blush; it warms up my skin and helps me look more tanned. Yoonchae Jeung: I do Korean-style makeup, which tends to look softer and sweeter than Western makeup. So I like to put blush right below my eyes, on my chin, sometimes even on my forehead. It helps your makeup look more even and perfectly matched. MMB: I think I suffer from blush blindness and that’s okay. I apply powder blush all over my nose and eyelids to create that pretty, slightly sunburnt look. R29: Megan, you’ve rocked some really cool hairstyles. What do you think your next hair transformation will be? Megan Skiendiel: After my ginger blonde situation last year [for the group’s hit summer song, “Touch”], it was very smart of me to dye my hair black and pink. It looked really cool and I wanted to keep my hair healthy. I’d love to go platinum blonde next, but dye the ends jet black. R29: What’s one beauty habit your fans might not know about? SL: One thing about me is that I will never let my lips get chapped. I just can’t focus when my lips are dry, and I use my lips to tell if I’m not drinking enough water. I love putting on a super thick layer of Glossier’s Lip Glaze, $22, before going to bed, and exfoliating my lips in the morning. When I wake up in the middle of the night to drink more water, I will always top it up, or put on Glossier’s Balm Dotcom, $16. I think that’s what makes my lips look plump and glossy all the time; it really comes from how I take care of my lips. R29: Last but not least, which Glossier products can’t you live without? MBB: Mine is the Futuredew Oil-Serum Illuminator, $26. It just gives me such a gorgeous glow and I just feel good putting it on. It also smells amazing. YJ: I really love Boy Brow, $22. The brand offers one in gray, which is so hard to find and looks so natural on my darker brows. LR: I’m literally wearing a full face of Glossier right now, but I think my favourite has to be the Stretch Concealer, $22. It’s so full coverage, and yet it feels like nothing on my skin and covers up literally everything. I also love that it comes in a teeny-tiny pot. MS: The Birthday flavor of Balm Dotcom, $16, has been my go-to ever since middle school. I recently lost mine and felt so sad that I went to the store to replace it immediately. The scent is so delicious and I feel nice putting it on. DA: I have really dry skin, and The Stretch Fluid Foundation, $34, is the first foundation that I genuinely liked. It’s super hydrating and creamy, and I’d definitely recommend that to anyone with dry skin. I also wear the Glossier You Fleur Eau de Parfum, $78, every single day. SL: I love Cloud Paint, $22, as a blush, but I also like putting a little bit of it over my eyeshadow and on my lips. It makes my makeup look more cohesive.

    "title": "People Are Still Questioning If Kristen Bell's Tattoos Are Real",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/kristen-bell-tattoos-47696956",
    "description": "Image Source: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Giorgio Armani More than a decade ago, images of Kristen Bell's tattoos began circling the internet. The ink that went viral on Twitter (now X) covered almost every area of her body, including her face. From the photos, you may have found yourself asking if the tattoos were real, and you wouldn't be alone. In fact, people are still left speculating on the matter to this day. Still, we want to be the ones to remind you that, no, they are not. We repeat: Kristen Bell's tattoo collection is nonexistent. (Although we can't say that some of those wouldn't be a good look on her.) The images in question were actually taken from an old skit that the \"Nobody Wants This\" star did with \"Funny or Die\" back in 2012, in which she reveals in a fake behind-the-scenes interview that she's actually covered with tattoos, and the reason none of her fans have ever seen them is because she uses a lot of makeup to cover them up. \"No one told me kristen bell had tattoos all over,\" one X user wrote back in December 2022. \"Is Kristen Bell the Most-Tattooed Actress?\" another headline read. Flash forward many years later, and the question came up again when the \"Nobody Wants This\" actor appeared in a \"Wired\" video to answer some of the internet's most-searched questions about her. Of course, whether Bell had any tattoos was one of them. In response, she answered that she did not but that she's always wanted to get one - much to the dismay of her husband, Dax Shepard, who is heavily tattooed himself. \"I've always wanted a tattoo, but my husband does not like girls with tattoos,\" she jokingly says in the clip. We're not sure if Bell will ever change her mind, but if her stance on tattoos does change anytime soon, there's no doubt in our minds she'll be quick to let us know. If social media is any indication, the world will be waiting. - Additional reporting by Jessica Harrington Danielle Jackson was a former assistant editor for PS Beauty.

    "description": "Like Kleenex, ChapStick, and Band-Aid, Botox is such a leader in its field that the brand name itself is regularly used to refer to the generic product it represents. For those who are unaware, \"Botox\" is actually just one branded product of botulinum toxin - an injectable neurotoxin famed for its ability to relax muscles and smooth out wrinkles - manufactured by Allergan, an American pharmaceutical company. While Botox was the first neuromodulator of its kind approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2009, a handful of others have since followed suit, from Dysport and Daxxify to the most recent, Letybo (letibotulinumtoxinA). Approved in 2024 for frown lines (aka 11 lines) but also available off-label for forehead wrinkles, lip flips, and beyond, Letybo is slowly but surely making its way into more medspas and derm offices. So, what's the deal with the newest Botox alternative on the block, and should you consider trying it out in lieu of its competitors? These questions and more, answered ahead with the help of some pros. Experts Featured in This Article Corey L. Hartman, MD, FAAD, is a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Skin Wellness Dermatology in Birmingham, Alabama. Ava Shamban, MD, is a board-certified celebrity dermatologist based in Los Angeles, and founder of AVA MD and Althaea Skin. She was also a clinical trial investigator for the product before filing for FDA approval. What Is Letybo? \"Similar to Botox and other neuromodulators, Letybo is a purified version of type A botulinum neurotoxin protein that works by blocking the nerve signals to the muscles responsible for contracting,\" says dermatologist Corey L. Hartman, MD, FAAD. Manufactured by medical aesthetics brand Hugel, Letybo hails from South Korea - a veritable mecca in the wide and wonderful world of beauty - with the brand boasting over 31 million successful treatments to date. In 2024, it received FDA approval for moderate-to-severe glabellar lines (aka frown lines), or the area in between the brows that is prone to wrinkling with continuous muscle contractions. Letybo vs. Botox Letybo has a few unique selling points compared to Botox and other neuromodulators, says dermatologist Ava Shamban, MD, who was a clinical trial investigator for the product before filing for its FDA approval. For starters, she says that Letybo is a more pure and stable molecule as it's produced through enzyme-free manufacturing and double chromatography. \"By removing bacterial side products, nucleic acids, and lyophilization, it gives Letybo more stability,\" Dr. Shamban says. \"New toxins entering the market are approved along with their manufacturing process, so the first generation toxins don't have the double purification, making the protein complex of Letybo slightly different.\" Benefits of Letybo Letybo is said to kick in more quickly than its competitors - sometimes as soon as one day but more commonly within 72 hours, says Dr. Shamban. This could give it an edge for those on a time-crunch or prize near-instant gratification. \"It may be recommended for a more 'impatient patient' who has an event within a few days' time, for example, and looking for a more rapid onset,\" she says. In terms of timing, the official consensus is that it can last for up to four months - the same ballpark as other neuromodulators, though Dr. Hartman has heard that it might have longer-lasting effects. \"The glabellar lines are one of the most common areas patients see neurotoxin treatment to reduce, or fully remove, so it's always positive to give patients another option,\" he says. For what it's worth, Letybo is the number-one frown line treatment in South Korea, according to total reported revenue from 2016–2024. Some patients (myself included) \"appreciate the standards associated with K-beauty aesthetics,\" says Dr. Shamban, \"so Letybo may be highly considered or requested by those looking to try the South Korean product.\" If you're trying to avoid the infamous frozen look, Letybo could also be up your alley. \"Anecdotally, I've seen that it has been effective in helping patients achieve a natural-looking appearance,\" says Dr. Hartman, \"But that also has to do with the proficiency and expertise of the injector.\" Dr. Shamban also points out that Letybo was the first neuromodulator used to assess psychological impact in a phase-three trial, with participants reporting a more youthful appearance and more confidence post-injection. \"There could be unique or additional benefits from its manufacturing, purity, or stability profile, but none have been studied at this time,\" she shares. Finally, it may be easier to find Letybo offered by providers at a slightly lower cost than the likes of Botox, Xeomin, Dysport, and others, potentially making it more accessible and budget-friendly. Of course, it goes without saying you'll want to go to a reputable and experienced injector who's familiar with the product. Dr. Hartman emphasizes investing in the provider's expertise, not just the product, for optimal results. After a consultation, your doctor might recommend one option over the other and it's best to trust their judgement. Safety Considerations of Letybo While neuromodulator injections might be as routine as a facial for some, it's still worth exercising caution, no matter which brand you decide on. \"The safety concerns for Letybo are similar to the safety concerns for other neuromodulators,\" says Dr. Hartman. \"The side effects are rare but possible, including some sensitivity at the injection site and some minor bruising, but it [typically] goes away within a day or so.\" Dr. Shamban agrees, noting that while Letybo is new to the U.S., it's been safely and successfully used in South Korea and other corners of the globe for years. \"There aren't really any additional concerns or considerations. Also, the product has exceptional safety, with only two percent headaches and 0.5 percent of eyelid and brow drop [reported] - lower than any of the competitors,\" she says. The Takeaway Neurotoxins are among the most prized treatments in aesthetic medicine, so having another FDA–approved option with demonstrated safety and efficacy is exciting for providers and patients alike. \"It is another tool in our toolkit of neuromodulator products to effectively manage lines and wrinkles,\" says Dr. Shamban. That said, while Letybo is specifically approved for frown lines, Dr. Shamban says it's suitable in other contexts where toxins are typically used - including but not limited to forehead lines, bunny lines, masseters, platysma bands, and even underarms and hands to mitigate hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) - in an off-label capacity. She adds that it might work better for some patients than others, so it's important to manage expectations and heed the advice from a qualified provider.
