    "description": "As soon as the first sign of summer appears on the forecast, our nails practically beg for a polish refresh. There’s just something about the season that makes us want to swap our go-to collection of pink and nude polishes with something a bit louder and more unapologetically fun. Think punchy corals, highlighter yellows, and vacation-ready beach nails. It certainly helps that every hot weather outfit can be instantly elevated with a pop of color on the hands and feet.To help narrow down the literal rainbow of summer manicure trends out there, we’ve tapped a group of in-the-know beauty editors to share their favorite nail polish shades. Whether you're looking for pedicure ideas or just want your fingers to match your iced matcha, these editor-approved picks are worth adding to your nail polish rotation this summer.All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.For more can't-miss shopping stories delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our Most Wanted newsletter.Nails. INC Sun Street Passage Neon Nail Polish“No one does neon nail polish quite like Nails.INC — the shades are seriously eye-catching. I love wearing them on my toes in summer; there’s something so satisfying about seeing this bright pink polish peeking out of the sand. I honestly think Nails.INC is underrated when it comes to staying power. Its formulas last on my toes for weeks (don’t tell my pedicurist!) without fading or dulling. Even better, the wide brush makes application a breeze — it only takes two swipes to coat each nail perfectly.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director, Refinery29Nails Inc. Sun Street Passage Neon Nail Polish, $, available at Nails Inc.Manucurist Green Natural Nail Polish in Ultramarine“When it comes to summer nails, my mantra is always ‘go flashy or go home’, and this electric blue really is that girl for turning heads and attracting compliments. I love pairing it with matching blue mascara and eyeliner because it really makes all the blues pop. It’s not always easy to find vibrant, punchy shades in regular polish, but Manucurist offers a fantastic option for just $14.” — Vanese Maddix, contributing beauty writer, Refinery29Manucurist Green Natural Nail Polish in Ultramarine, $, available at ManucuristChanel Le Vernis Longwear Nail Colour in Poète“Nothing feels more summery to me than biting into a perfectly ripe peach. Poète, a blush orange hue from Chanel’s spring-summer lineup, perfectly captures this juicy, sweet fruit. I like that it’s not the kind of highly saturated neon orange that commands too much attention and makes it difficult to match my outfit. It’s the ideal crossover between orange and pink, and looks so lovely with the friendship bracelets and jade bangles I like to wear in the summer.” — Venus Wong, senior writer, Refinery29Chanel Le Vernis Longwear Nail Colour in Poète, $, available at UltaMooncat Nail Polish in Mermaid Bait “I am obsessed with the dynamic finishes in Mooncat's collection, and this chromatic turquoise has been my favorite, especially for beach season. It's so shiny that every time I wear it, people think it's gel and ask how my manicurist achieved the effect. I love how the chrome shifts between pink to gold and even lime green depending on how the light hits, and the lacquer itself has serious staying power. I can go almost two weeks with minimal wear.” — Marianne Mychaskiw, beauty writer and TV hostMooncat Nail Polish in Mermaid Bait, $, available at MooncatMavala Mini Color in Jaipur“This is the juiciest orange shade, and I actually love that the bottle is only 0.17 fl.oz. so it’s easy to slip into your luggage and perfect for quick top-ups if you get any chips. Even better, I never have to worry about it drying out, since I get through it much faster than larger bottles. It looks great on fingers and toes, but I prefer it on my feet — it really livens up my mostly black sandal collection!” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director, Refinery29Mavala Mini Color in Jaipur, $, available at WalmartEssie Expressie Quick Dry Nail Color in Ahead of the Gam(er)“While I’m a bit of a creature of habit when it comes to my go-to nail polish colors, seeing so many incredible green manicures trending this year has me itching to switch up my reliable reds and trusty neutrals for something a little more fun. Enter: Essie Expressie Quick Dry Nail Color in Ahead of the Gam(er). Punchier than the more pared-back matcha shades that we’ve been seeing for spring, this is a vibrant lime green that feels fresh, fun, and perfect for summer. While it isn’t quite as neon as some of the Day Glo-inspired brights that I’ve seen taking off for the season ahead, it’s undeniably joy-inducing. Plus, this fast-drying formula from Essie is perfect if you have no patience to sit still and wait for your nails to dry like me.” — Mica Ricketts, freelance beauty journalistEssie expressie Quick Dry Nail Color, $, available at AmazonOPI Infinite Shine Nail Lacquer In Alpine Snow“A crisp white polish is my default pedicure color when I go on an extended summer holiday. It’s a no-brainer shade that goes with everything and looks so good peeping out of brown leather sandals. One thing I will say is that white polish tends to scratch and chip quite easily, and can look streaky if you’re not careful enough. That’s why the OPI Infinite Shine range is my favorite: the gel-like formula stays put for up to 11 days without chipping, and the brush design is very beginner-friendly. It’s practically foolproof.” — Venus Wong, senior writerOPI Infinite Shine Alpine Snow, $, available at UltaDazzle Dry Nail Polish in Sail Away“I love a pastel blue year-round, but there’s something about Dazzle Dry’s Sail Away that feels so right for summer. Photos don’t do this gorgeous periwinkle justice. It’s a truly unique hue that’s equal parts blue and lilac, and really pops without being a bright, loud color. My favorite way to wear it is with a breezy linen white button down, denim shorts, and a crisp glass of rosé.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer, Refinery29Dazzle Dry Dazzle Dry Nail Polish in Sail Away, $, available at Dazzle DryNails.INC Super Dew 4-Piece Nail Polish Set“After flirting with all the colors of the rainbow with my manicures over the years, I've settled into a groove with my nail color of choice — and it’s very much in the minimal, clean vibe. Nails.INC is always on top of the trends, but where they excel, in my opinion, is with this fresh, clean manicure that always looks well put together. The brand’s Super Dew combo, $22, is an ideal foursome that features a sheer pink and bright sheer white polish that can be topped with a glow-enhancing sheer pop of pink and contains a nourishing cuticle oil for soft, supple cuticles. I’ve been applying two layers of Knightsbridge Nights Out (the peach pink on the bottom left) on my fingers and toes, and the effect is chic, clean, and goes-with-anything.” — Emma Guns, podcaster, beauty editor, and presenterNails Inc. Super Dew 4-Piece Nail Polish Set, $, available at Nails Inc.Olive \u0026 June Long-Lasting Polish in Lava“I really only wear bright red nail polish from July through September, and Essie’s Clambake is my all-time favorite. This shade was recently resurrected from the vault but is (sadly) already sold out. Olive \u0026 June’s Lava is a close match. There’s something about this spicy shade of red that reminds me of outdoor summer festivities (like seafood bakes), and to me, it’s as summery as it gets.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer, Refinery29Olive \u0026 June Long-Lasting Polish in Lava, $, available at Olive \u0026 JuneLike what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-perfume-fragrance-trends-2025?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "There’s something about the arrival of summer that calls for a clean slate — and a new perfume to go with it. If you ask us, switching up your fragrance is one of the easiest ways to usher in a shiny new season. Whether you’re looking to swap out your signature scent or simply want to grow your fragrance collection, this summer’s perfume trends offer something for every taste and budget. Ahead, we asked fragrance experts to share the trends that will shape this summer and beyond. Here’s what they predict — and where to shop them. DashDividers_1_500x100 Salted Scents Lee Howes, Lush fragrance category lead, predicts that salty, marine scents will dominate summer, providing an instantly refreshing antidote to hot and humid weather. But don’t underestimate them, says Howes: “They can either be bold and brash or subtle and sensual,” he says. “For a jolt of refreshment, Dirty Perfume, $55, or Dirty Body Spray, $42, offers an instant blast of cool herbal notes with spearmint, sandalwood, and thyme.” For something even more alluring, Howes adds that Salty Body Spray, $50, utilizes floral neroli and rose, as well as warming and grounding oudh, plus salted notes that smell like “warm skin after you’ve just stepped out of the ocean.” This, he says, is one of Lush’s best-kept secrets.  Also try Oscar Emil Sex On The Beach, $169, with salty cocoa, creamy sandalwood, and skin-like musk, and ‘Ôrebella Salted Muse, $72, with sea salt accord, zingy pink pepper, and comforting lavender. If you’d rather spend less, try Zara Salty Ocean Bouquet, $49. Created by Jo Malone, it boasts sea salt, citrusy bergamot, and floral orange blossom. Summer Rain Perfume Expert Aamna Lone, aka @perfumeconnoisseurz on Instagram, explains, “Nostalgic memories of childhood summers and the fresh, earthy scent of rain are things we love to find comfort in through fragrance,” — and it all comes down to the notes. “The ‘summer rain’ aroma is linked to petrichor, which carries the specific scent of rain on dry concrete after a long dry summer, and geosmin, which is produced by soil bacteria. It gives rise to that damp, earthy freshness,” says Lone. Several fragrances capture this essence beautifully, she adds: “A standout is Vyrao Mamajuju Eau de Parfum, $220, and Perfumer H Rain Wood, $200, both of which bottle the essence of petrichor.” Lone also recommends Escentric Molecules Molecule 05, $160, which features cashmeran: “This compound has that crisp, clean quality of fresh rain, making it perfect for layering,” she says. Just Peachy Peach is undeniably the fruity It note of the year, says Eudora Nwasike, a fragrance specialist certified by The Fragrance Foundation. “Once seen as overly sweet or youthful, it’s now being reimagined in elevated, intimate ways,” she explains, often paired with soft musks, creamy woods, and sensual leather notes. “The result is a contemporary peach: velvety, nostalgic, and deeply sensual,” adds Nwasike. To her, the note feels comforting, playful, and radiant. “It’s perfect for a hot summer’s day, evoking the feeling of sun on your skin.” Speaking of skin, both Nwasike and Lone — who also tips peach as the next big fragrance note — describe Phlur’s Peach Skin Hair \u0026 Body Fragrance Mist, $25, as sunshine in a bottle: “This velvety peach is laced with juicy plum and sparkling Bellini,” Nwasike says — the ultimate summer cocktail. She also champions Guerlain Pêche Mirage Eau de Parfum, $425, with realistic peach and creamy sandalwood. Keen to spend less? Try Le Monde Gourmand Peche Delicieuse Eau de Parfum, £28, or Zara Peach Sorbet Eau de Parfum, $19.   Heatwave In A Bottle Summer is a time to indulge in heady revelry, says Howes, and some fragrance fans are turning to bolder, more intense perfumes that melt into the skin and linger in the warmth of humid summer nights. “Look for deeper rose scents, with hints of jasmine and even oudh notes to encapsulate those late nights over a cocktail,” suggests Howes. He rates Sappho Perfume, $270, and says it’s arguably one of Lush’s most sensual fragrances, thanks to a big dose of powdery orris blended with warm vanilla, and rich, smoky tobacco. “It’ll turn some heads in the best way,” says Howes. Also try Creed Eladaria Eau de Parfum, $300, with rose and vanilla, or H\u0026M Hopeful Romantic Eau de Toilette, $12.99, with jasmine and orange blossom.  Accessible Luxury A growing trend in the fragrance industry is the launch of smaller-sized bottles at more accessible price points, says Nwasike: “By offering 15ml sizes, for example, brands can meet this demand while introducing the next generation to the world of fragrance in a way that feels both aspirational and attainable.” It’s also a great way to sample a fragrance before committing to a full-size bottle. Loewe, Glossier, and Kayali are just a few brands now offering perfumes in sizes ranging from 8ml to 15ml.  Fragrance For Your… Pants Gourmand perfumes — inspired by sweet, moreish, edible notes — have surged in popularity, but can feel heavy in summer humidity. A clever workaround? “Spraying your gourmand fragrances on your [pants] or legs,” says Lone. “It’s a strange but great summertime hack to prevent a cloying gourmand bubble when mixed with heat,” she adds. The idea is simple: “You’ll get wafts of the fragrance when you walk around, so you can wear your gourmand perfumes in the summer without the [sickly] feeling.” Try Kayali Fleur Majesty Rose Royale | 31 Eau de Parfum, $100, with rose and peach, and Valentino Born in Roma Donna Extradose Parfum, $115, with rum and vanilla. Delicate Florals “This summer, expect florals to be less full-on or cloying,” says Howes. “Instead, perfume showcases a fresher, more gentle profile.” Howes’ pick? Lush’s Sakura Body Spray, $45. “This makes you feel like you’re walking through a cherry blossom-filled park under a slight breeze. Also try Shade Perfume, $55, which offers a gently wooded base offset with a very subtle lavender note to provide some respite from a busy, bustling life,” he says. We also love Balmain Glanc Galaxie Eau de Parfum, $190, with creamy magnolia and heady patchouli balanced by zingy bergamot, mandarin, and lime. Then there’s Marc Jacobs Daisy Wild Eau de Parfum, $90, and Cult Gaia Mast Eau de Parfum, $228, both with green vetiver and blossom. If you’re on a budget, try Floral Street Wonderland Peony Perfume Mist, $28, with dainty floral notes of rose water, powdery violet, and, of course, airy peony.  Smells Like Teen Spirit Fragrance mists are having a moment, and they’re now bigger, better, and more versatile than ever, according to Michelle Feeney, founder of Floral Street. “They are a glass-free, lightweight option to power up all over,” she says. Floral Street’s trio of mists will soon be joined by a fourth — Arizona Bloom, launching this summer. “With added non-drying, skin-friendly benefits, they’re made to create lasting memories of this year’s Glastonbury festival,” adds Feeney. Gourmand, But Make It Fresh “Over the past year, we’ve indulged in rich, dessert-inspired scents,” says Howes, “but now, there’s growing conversation around blending fresher elements with traditional gourmand notes like vanilla, toffee, and chocolate.” Howes expects to see fruitier elements come into play, and suggests looking out for bergamot, lime, cherry, strawberry, and orange to cut through sweeter bases. “This also provides comfort with lightness and playfulness,” says Howes. “Lush’s Chelsea Morning Perfume, $45, is perfect for this. Indulgent vanilla and tonka are peppered with zesty lemon myrtle to conjure thoughts of slow Sunday mornings over breakfast.” Beauty editors are going wild for The 7 Virtues Amber Vanilla Eau de Parfum, $94, with sweet santal and vanilla plus fresher skin musks. Also try H\u0026M Creative Visionary Eau de Toilette, $7.99, with creamy white flowers, heady patchouli, and juicy guava.  Vintage Vibes, Modern Mood This summer marks a return to classic fragrance notes like powdery orris, lush Damask rose, and heady patchouli — reimagined with a modern twist, says Feeney. While these rich scents make a strong statement on their own, they’re softened and uplifted by fresher, more delicate touches like lemon and peach, making them tonnes more wearable, she adds. Try Floral Street’s Iris Goddess Eau de Parfum, $97, with orris, lemon zest and chilli powder, and Chypre Sublime Eau de Parfum, $97, with violets, patchouli and incense.  This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK.

    "description": "Ariana Grande's tattoo collection has been in the making for years. She may not be the most tattooed celebrity in history, but her collection of ink is still pretty impressive. Over the years, the \"Wicked\" star has amassed more than 50 designs, and she doesn't appear to be slowing down anytime soon. In fact, she revealed in a recent interview on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" that she and costar Cynthia Erivo have gotten a bunch of new designs for the movie, including a few matching inks and an illustration of the original Glinda from the 1900s book. Grande's tattoos span her entire body, from her neck down to her feet, and each one is uniquely her. Many tell a story and hold sentimental value. She has a tattoo of the nickname her grandfather gave her, a few that reference her favorite movies, and various other culture–related designs (like a \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" quote). She also has a long list of designs that represent her career in music, like a \"Sweetener\" World Tour tattoo she got with her bandmates. But that's not to say that all of Grande's tattoos are meticulously thought out or always go as planned. There was that incident with the infamous \"7 Rings\" tattoo, and over the years, she's had to get quite a few old tattoos from past relationships covered up. Some of the star's designs are in not-so-obvious spots, like her ribcage, while others are on full display. By far, her easiest designs to spy are her many hand and finger tattoos. The star has also been slowly getting a handful of her older designs lasered off, including the Eevee \"Pokémon\" tattoo on her inner arm. But fear not: we rounded up her full collection ahead. To get a closer look at Grande's tattoos and learn about their meanings, read on.",

    "description": "Megan Fox's tattoo collection has been in the works since she was 18 years old, but over the last few years, she's really given it a major update. In general, Fox has undergone quite a metamorphosis recently. After taking a break from the spotlight, she's back and making a big, big splash - from her engagement to Machine Gun Kelly back in January 2022 (and their many subsequent shocking red carpet moments) to countless major beauty transformations. It's no secret that Fox is a big fan of body art. Her current collection includes over 15 known pieces spanning her arms, back, ribs, and neck. This total includes one matching tattoo with MGK and another couple tattoo for ex-husband Brian Austin Green, which she recently covered. She has spoken openly about going through the process of removing a few of her older designs. This includes her first-ever - and arguably most iconic - design: Marilyn Monroe's portrait on her forearm. Fox's ink is primarily done in one cohesive traditional tattoo style using all-black ink, but she does have a couple of small colorful designs. She has a few quote tattoos in gothic lettering, as well as an original poem etched on her side in a similar fashion. The actor also has a design of the phrase \"the darkest fairytale\" scribbled on her inner forearm, which was done by Kelly himself; he has a matching design on his hip. And as if that wasn't enough, Fox's most recent design is a full sleeve, which she debuted at the 2024 Grammys. Before that, she had a tattoo session in July 2023 that yielded 19 new finger tattoos, proving she's not finished building her portfolio. Each design has a special meaning behind it, so to learn all about Megan Fox's tattoos, keep reading.",
