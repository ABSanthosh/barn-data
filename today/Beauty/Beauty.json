    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/gala-gold-hair-color-49426388",
    "description": "New hair trends make waves every year, but only a select few leave a lasting impression. So far in 2025, the hair world has buzzed with bold, head-turning hues like the sleek shine of glossy black and the fiery pop of cherry red. Now, a fresh contender is taking the spotlight: the \"gala gold\" hair-color trend. The buttery, sunlit tones of gala gold create a timeless elegance that adds vibrancy to your look. With its multidimensional glow and universally flattering warmth, Gala gold is poised to be the most sought-after shade of the year. If you've spent years asking for ash tones, it might even redefine the way you think about blondes. Below, expert colorists reveal everything you need to know about gala-gold hair, including how to maintain it. Experts Featured in This Article Michelle Hong is a celebrity hair colorist and founder of NYC The Team salon in New York City. Diana Mildice is a colorist at Maxine Salon in Chicago. What Is the Gala-Gold Hair Color Trend? Celebrity hair colorist Michelle Hong describes gala-gold hair as \"the perfect hue of gold that is flattering on almost everyone.\" This delicate shade seamlessly blends bright blond and golden undertones to achieve a radiant, sunlit glow. \"It delivers a soft yet luminous honey tone that feels both warm and rich,\" Hong says. How to Achieve Gala-Gold Hair Achieving the perfect gala gold look requires expert precision, so it's best left to the pros. \"This look is achieved by blending blond with deep, rich hues of gold,\" says colorist Diana Mildice. The beauty of gala gold hair lies in its versatility. However, it can easily look off, if the application technique is unbalanced. Hong agrees, noting that in-salon balayage is the go-to technique. \"Balayage lifts the natural level and creates feathered dimension for an overall lightness,\" she says. A deep golden gloss is then applied to enrich the balayage, resulting in a luminous glow. How to Maintain Gala-Gold Hair at Home Maintaining gala gold hair is all about using the right products to preserve vibrancy and keep hair healthy. Hong recommends Shu Uemura YUBI Blonde Glow Revealing Shampoo ($23) for gentle cleansing that leaves hair with a glowing finish. Follow up with a lightweight but deep conditioning mask like Verb Ghost Hair Mask ($20) to lock in moisture and hydration, then finish with Shu Uemura Color Lustre Sealer Spray ($62) to reduce fading, protect against UV damage, and boost shine.",

    "description": "If scrunchies, banana eyeliner, and blush draping have taught us anything, it's that old things become new again in the beauty space - you just have to give them time. That's why we're not surprised the flipped hairstyle is making a huge comeback. Flipped hair has been around for decades - Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Priscilla Presley both wore the style back in the day - but the new hairstyle trend puts a modern spin on it. Instead of lots of volume at the crown of the head, this version features sleek, pin-straight hair with the ends curled up into a sharp C shape. \"Whether it's paired with a ponytail, half-up half-down, [or] all down with a side or middle part, I think it's such a fun way to spice up a sleek, straight look this spring,\" celebrity hairstylist Hayley Heckmann says. \"The style is super flattering on everyone and totally elevates a look.\" Experts Featured in This Article Hayley Heckmann is a celebrity hairstylist and Unite Hair Care brand partner. Devin Toth is a NYC-based hairstylist at Salon SCK. The Comeback of '60s Hairstyles: Flipped Hair We've seen the flipped hairstyle pop up a few times over the last couple of years, but it's gotten even more popular recently, thanks to celebrities and beauty-lovers on TikTok. Ariana Grande, Cardi B, Keke Palmer, Zendaya, and Jennifer Lopez have all rocked the retro look on more than one occasion, with each putting their own spin on it. If you need any further convincing, see Kim Kardashian's look for the 2025 Fifteen Percent Pledge Gala. \"The hair flip - where it's a bob haircut or long hair in a pony - gives a cooler-than-school, '60s retro vibe,\" hairstylist Devin Toth previously told PS. \"And who wouldn't want that?\" The retro look is fun and flirty for spring, and we're predicting there will be even more celebrities embracing the trend in the coming weeks as the weather warms up more. To see the '60s hairstyle action, keep scrolling.",

    "title": "Black Women Are Planning Their Hairstyles For The Entire Year. Here’s How",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-haircare-calendar-salon-appointments?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "It’s the beginning of the year, a time when most people map out their plans for the next few months. This means organizing holidays, birthdays, and hen-dos, and for some Black women, it also means sorting out a hair calendar.  Hair calendars started making noise on TikTok during the latter half of 2024. In these videos, Black women detail the different hairstyles they intend to do throughout the upcoming year in a bid to take the stress out of deciding on a style and keep hair “done” all year round. As part of the hair calendar, Black beauty creators also share their hair goals, from retaining length and sticking to a healthy hair routine to rebranding their image. When I first started seeing these videos, I thought, “This is genius; why hasn’t anyone thought about doing this before?” It’s such a simple concept, but it had never crossed my mind to plan out my hairstyles months in advance. I usually plan one hairstyle and decide my next hair-do as I go on. However, designing a hair schedule can help you prep your hair for your upcoming hairstyle, put money away towards buying hair for a specific style, and allow you to find a suitable hairdresser in time. Let’s face it: in the age of risky Instagram stylists, no one wants to wake up on the day of her appointment with a ‘hey sis’ DM… But, as I started to think about hair calendars, I wondered just how healthy they are for our hair. Should we be doing our hair back-to-back without any breaks? After all protective hairstyles aren’t that protective if you aren’t making sure your hair is getting the nourishment it needs between hairstyles.  In addition to this, do we always need to have our hair done?  The pressure for Black women to always look polished and remain “done” is a pervasive one (remember “TikTok’s £1000 monthly high maintenance routines”?) — shouldn’t we be scheduling some time for our hair to breathe between appointments?  While the concerns are valid, I still believe Black women can mostly benefit from hair calendars. Unbothered spoke to Harriet Kessie-Cudjoe, co-founder and creative director of Afrotherapy Salon in London, who gave her top tips for the ideal hair calendar in 2025.  DashDividers_1_500x100 What are hair calendars and are they beneficial for Black haircare and maintenance? Organizing your hairstyles according to each month is a pretty smart concept. It’s widely known that Black women in the US are estimated to spend six times more on haircare than white women and committing to having various looks can be very expensive. Last year, Unbothered’s Black Haircare survey found that specialist Black hairstylists charge, on average, $200-$300 for popular hairstyles such as medium-length box braids, and almost all asked for 25% fees upfront. Planning — and budgeting! — for hair appointments in advance could help Black women manage their coins over a year.  A hair calendar also allows you to be intentional with your haircare, and Kessie-Cudjoe agrees. Afrotherapy Salon has a hair plan and a monthly direct debit payment for clients committed to their hair routine. “Planning hairstyles in advance can help protect the hair, promote healthy growth, and align with specific goals, such as retaining length or recovering from damage,”  Kessie-Cudjoe says. However, she thinks hair calendars can be too rigid and don’t necessarily consider seasons, trends, changes in lifestyle, and personal circumstances.“It’s essential to stay flexible. Hair needs can change due to weather, lifestyle, or unexpected challenges like breakage. A hair calendar works best when it’s a guide, not a rigid plan.” @niaraalexis_ The summer set sme up for gorgeous silk press 🙋🏾‍♀️💪🏾 #hair #hairtok #hairstyle ♬ All Night – Ndup So, what are the best Black hairstyles according to each season? Winter: Cold weather can be harsh on Black hair, leading to dryness and breakage. Kessie-Cudjoe suggests that Black women opt for protective styles like box braids, twists, or wigs to shield the hair from the elements. Black women should “Use satin-lined hats or scarves to protect your edges and retain moisture. Condition regularly to combat dryness.” Spring: As the weather gets milder, it can be a great time to let your natural hair breathe. Kessie-Cudjoe says this is ideal for wash-and-go styles, twist-outs, and braid-outs. “Incorporate moisture-rich products to keep your hair hydrated as the weather transitions.” @kristina.manners Twist out tutorial🤎✨ The most important tip I have for a successful twist-out is to wait until your hair is COMPLETELY dry to unravel the twists! What tips do you have to achieve a successful twist out?! #coilyhair #curlyhair #twistoutroutine #type4hair #naturalhair ♬ Labios Mordidos – Remix – Fran Garro Summer: I am a braid girly all year round but my braids really thrive in the summer. Not only are they low-maintenance but Kessie-Cudjoe explains that they’re perfect for managing sweat and maintaining hair health. “If swimming, use protective leave-in conditioners to guard against chlorine or saltwater damage,” she adds. Not a fan of braids? Kessie-Cudjoe says summer is a time to be more with adventurous styles like pixie cuts and color.  Autumn: As temperatures cool, it’s a great opportunity to focus on transitioning styles. “Wigs, faux locs, or crochet braids are excellent for low manipulation while still allowing flexibility. Incorporate moisturizing treatments to prepare your hair for the drier winter months,” Kessie-Cudjoe says.  Holidays: Planning a holiday is one thing; figuring out what hairstyle to sport abroad can be another burden. Here’s how Kessie-Cudjoe thinks you should approach your hair on holiday. “As a general rule, Black women should opt for low-maintenance, protective hairstyles that withstand heat, humidity, and water activities while keeping hair healthy. Here are some options: 1. Braids (Box Braids, Knotless Braids, or Cornrows): Braids in all their variations are versatile and perfect for hot climates. They keep hair off the neck, reduce the need for daily styling, and can handle water exposure. 2. Faux Locs or Twists: Lightweight and stylish, these protective styles are easy to manage and withstand humidity and water without losing shape. 3. Bantu Knots or Two-Strand Twists: Heat-friendly styles, like Bantu knots, allow the scalp to breathe and require minimal upkeep. They’re great for embracing natural hair textures. 4. Pineapple Updo or High Puff: Perfect for naturals who want to rock their hair, these styles are easy to refresh daily and keep hair off the face in the heat. @athenaarr #fyp #4chair ♬ original sound – DJ Mashakes Should hair calendars take into account trims, treatments, and hair breaks? I hate to break it to you, but you should give your hair a breather before trying another hairstyle.  “For those who regularly wear their hair in braids, a moisture treatment would be advised whenever they take their hair out, and the hair should be allowed to “breathe for as long as possible,” Kessie-Cudjoe says. “As a general rule, the hair needs a good balance of protein and moisture, and so this can be alternated and personalized to suit the hair,” she adds.   Kessie-Cudjoe ideal hair plan/calendar should be personalised to each individual’s goal and she normally advises clients to plan their hair around the following: -Hair goals – Hair type – Profession/Career -Seasons -Lifestyle -Holidays – Events And don’t forget the trims! Kessie-Cudjoe suggests that we should account for a trim every three to four months however, this guideline varies from person to person.  We know that hair is a complex topic for Black women, and we all have different relationships with it. However, I love having the ability to change my hair depending on my mood, season, or occasion. Black hair is so versatile that sticking to one hairstyle doesn’t feel right.  So, hair calendars are a great way to explore different hairstyles. However, it’s also essential to maintain healthy hair and allow it to breathe instead of continuously changing styles. I’ll consider Kessie-Cudjoe’s tips when planning my hair for 2025.  This article was originally published on Unbothered UK Like what you see?

The board-certified dermatologist is known for her refreshingly real, unfiltered skincare advice (given occasionally from her bed, earning her the online moniker “#PillowtalkDerm,”) which she channeled into a targeted, solutions-oriented product range. (Her Major Fade Hyper Serum is a fan-favorite for showing dark spots the door.) And just in time for the dog days of winter, she’s here to diagnose your dry, chapped lips and offer the ultimate salve. (I mean, solve.) Meet the Dr. Idriss Barrier Baste Lip Basting Duo, a two-step miracle routine for your lips. The $44 duo consists of the Barrier Baste Lip Peel, a rinse-free exfoliating lip serum infused with glycerin and mandelic acid to slough off dead, crusty skin without compromising your lips’ barrier. (It’s for this reason that Dr. Idriss prefers a liquid peel over a physical scrub.) Rounding out the dynamic duo is the Barrier Baste Lip Baste, which locks in moisture and protects lips overnight thanks to ceramides, squalane, and shea butter. All in all, the concept is a bit like that scene in Ratatouille where Remy has his brother taste a piece of cheese, then a strawberry, and then combine them together for a mind-blowingly delicious result set to upbeat jazzy music. Ahead, we put the innovative new launch to the test — here’s what Refinery29 beauty editors had to say. DashDividers_1_500x100 Dr. Idriss Barrier Baste Lip Basting Duo, $44 “No matter how many lip butters, salves, and oils I hoard, nothing has been able to offer a long-lasting solution for my chronically dry lips. Balms felt nice on, sure, but I almost always felt as though the product was just sitting on top of my lips instead of being absorbed. Any hydrating or softening benefits tended to be fleeting at best, and it didn’t occur to me that the issue was that dead skin on my lips was literally getting in the way of moisturizing ingredients actually being able to do their thing. The two Barrier Baste tubes may look similar at first glance, but they are, in fact, very different formulas. The first step — the Barrier Baste Lip Peel — is not like anything I’ve ever seen. The tiny tube with a cooling rollerball applicator makes it so easy to apply a super thin layer with no mess. I let it dry for a few seconds before applying the Barrier Baste Lip Baste, which looks relatively no-frills but is easily one of the best lip balms I’ve ever tried. It’s silky and indulgent but not thick and waxy like other lip treatments I’ve tried. I applied this before bed and woke up to smoother, pillowier (I’m sorry for the non-word, it’s just the best way I can describe it!) lips the next morning. I have been repeating use about every other night since then to maintain. I can now say that my lips have their own nighttime skincare routine — and are so much happier for it.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer DashDividers_1_500x100 “When I tried Dr. Idriss’ “lip basting” hack a couple years ago (essentially treating lips with an exfoliating acid to buff away dry skin and following with a thick balm to seal it in) I was so impressed. I use glycolic acid on my face, scalp, and feet, so why didn’t I consider using it on my parched lips? After a few goes, my lips were softer and visibly smoother. Fast forward to this week and Dr. Idriss has taken her smart hack to new heights, creating a pocket-friendly lip exfoliator and lip balm duo to get the job done much more easily. I like that the Barrier Baste Lip Peel (which includes exfoliating mandelic acid) features a roller ball to take the chore out of application. Contrary to my initial thoughts, it didn’t sting (I’m prone to picking) or dry my lips out, and that’s all thanks to a heavy helping of moisturizing glycerin. Instead, it gently lifts away dry skin that I’d usually bite away. When you’ve slicked on the exfoliator, it’s time to use the balm, which is satisfyingly thick but never sticky. It feels more like a nourishing lip gloss. Happily, the balm can be used on its own, too. I’ve been carrying it inside my bag for the last few weeks as it’s freezing in London and my lips are the first to feel the cold. As you can see, there isn’t a single piece of dry skin. In fact, I’m pretty certain it’s working to plump my lips, too. Honestly? This is the second time that Dr. Idriss has saved my lips and I love her for it!” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director DashDividers_1_500x100 “As someone with perpetually flaky lips, I never go to bed without wearing at least two coats of lip balm, but they don’t always do much for my dehydrated skin. Getting rid of the little scales on my lips has become somewhat of a hyperfixation for me, and I’ve tried everything from physical lip scrubs (too harsh) to ripping them off one by one (super painful and bloody — would not recommend). This two-step treatment from Dr. Idriss therefore cannot come at a better time in my life. The Barrier Baste Lip Peel gently removes dead skin cells with mandelic acid, a chemical exfoliant also found in some of my favorite cleansers. I appreciate the minty sensation I get as I glide this across my lips, and that I don’t have to rinse anything off afterwards. Once the peel no longer feels sticky, it’s time to slather on the Lip Baste. Enriched with ceramides and squalane — both moisturizing ingredients I tend to gravitate towards in the winter — it feels like a nourishing (but not overly greasy) protective coat on the lips. I’d say that it’s far more efficient at locking in moisture and stays on the skin than your average lip mask, and I wake up with the softest, most pillowy lips. I’ve been turning to this combo the night before I’m due to wear lipstick to prep my lips, in order to make sure they have all the hydration they need.” — Venus Wong, Senior Writer Like what you see?
