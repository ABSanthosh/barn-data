    "description": "For some, a lipstick is just a lipstick. But for others, it’s a source of strength, creativity, and expression. In our series Power Faces, we’ll explore the relationship between strong women and the makeup they choose to wear — or not. In partnership with NYX, our latest subject is Sunny Poudel, a Nepalese American beauty content creator and dental student. This story was told to Fawnia Soo Hoo and edited for length and clarity. When I moved halfway across the world from Nepal to Falls Church, Virginia at 14 years old, the first friend I made was a girl named Lily. I had this little drugstore lip gloss and she asked me what it was — and then: “Can I use it?” So I shared it with her. That was how makeup started for me — as a way to connect and make friends.  In Nepal, I played around with makeup, but for the most part, it was reserved for special occasions. When I moved to the states, I felt out of place, insecure, different as a person of color living in a predominantly white area and going to a school where no one looked like me — so I hid behind makeup. Eyeliner was the only makeup my parents allowed me to wear to school, and I remember going to the CVS near my house to buy my first — NYX caught my attention because it was affordable and accessible. Looking back at pictures, my foundation was about 20 shades too light, but at the time, it made me feel better about myself. It felt like I was taking care of myself. Then I quickly realized makeup was a way to bond with others, and I started to do my friends’ makeup.  And it was a way to connect with my mom, too. I used to basically force my little sister to let me do her makeup — she was my muse — and my mom would reprimand me and say, “You can’t buy makeup; you shouldn’t do this to her.” Eventually, my mom started to ask me if I could do her makeup for her, especially if she had events to go to. My dad, though, yelled at me for wearing makeup. “You need to focus on school,” he’d say. “You’re not gonna get anywhere if you’re putting on makeup.” But when I started dental school, he realized that makeup — and being creative — helps me deal with stress. And it allows me the opportunity to meet people in a completely different industry. Now, he’s incredibly supportive. He gets it now. Growing up, I knew I wanted to be in healthcare. As an immigrant daughter, I was the one translating at doctor’s appointments for my mother, explaining things to her in a way that made sense. I saw how overwhelming it could be to navigate the healthcare system without that support. I wanted to be part of a field where I could provide that help. For me, dentistry isn’t just about fixing teeth — it’s about representation, combined with a deeper sense of purpose to help people. At the same time, I was a super artistic child, and I began to post makeup looks and upload YouTube videos, not really knowing where that would lead. When I came to New York to pursue my dental career, I started posting more consistently, because the city inspires me. People say New York is the place where all your dreams come true, and I know it’s corny, but it’s true. I’m in a city where so many things can be true, where all my dreams can come true. Why do I have to give one up for the other? Both dentistry and makeup are equally important to me, and both are a true reflection of who I am. In dentistry, there are rules, guidelines, and a specific way things are supposed to be done. Everything has to be precise and follow an exact order. You’re working in millimeters. As much as I love the structure and organization, I also don’t want to think about it after a long day at school. When I come home, I get to be creative. I get to try something different and fun. With makeup, there are no rules. I’m free to create and let things take shape however they want. Because of that, it takes the pressure off. I’m free to “mess up.” And sometimes when I do “mess up,” it leads me to a whole new makeup look I hadn’t planned. I love that makeup lets me express myself without any limitations. Makeup is my break from school, and, when I’m in school, it’s my break from everything else. It’s like turning off one part of my brain when I’m doing the other. One helps balance the other out.  Honestly, I’m not sure if I would love makeup if I was doing it all the time. But the fact that I focus on it at such a specific time allows me to be more creative. Here’s an example: I saw some photos of people with bleached eyebrows. I loved the look, so I tried it and shared it with my audience. Not everyone liked it on me, but who cares? It was fun. So much of my inspiration comes from seeing makeup on people who don’t look like me and wanting to know how it’ll look on me.  Before, I used to stick with one makeup look. Now, I want to push myself out of my comfort zone, to experiment with trends and ideas I wouldn’t normally try. Whenever I want to experiment with colorful, creative looks, I always turn to NYX for inspiration — the brand is such a great source for ideas and creativity. I did a red lip for the first time, and I loved it; I immediately felt like a boss woman. And that’s the beauty of it all: I love that the way I perceive myself changes based on what makeup I’m wearing. And I still love the fact that makeup brings people together. It’s been that way my whole life, and it’s how I made one of my closest friends at dental school. We were at a party in our first year, and she was upset. She wanted to go home because she thought she looked oily. I said to her, “Girl, I have my beauty powder right here.”  It was the first time we met, and we laugh about it to this day. “How were you so comfortable just blotting my face?” she asked me recently. And I replied, “Because I saw you needed it.” I love that about makeup. Shop Sunny’s makeup look: Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "description": "We love a manicure that sounds like a snack. Light blue nail polish is cuter positioned as “blueberry milk nails” and a “vanilla manicure” is more fun than a plain white one — it just is. If you’re “dry” on inspiration for your next manicure, let us introduce the biggest nail trend of the holiday season: the dirty martini manicure. What are dirty martini nails exactly? It’s not just green polish, but a specific nail art design with a subtle Spanish olive accent that has slowly taken over mood boards, worn by celebrities, like Hailey Bieber, and seen in trendy nail salons from NYC to LA. To dig deeper into the trend — and learn exactly how ask for it — we went directly to the source, the artist who created the martini olive art months before it became trendy, Betina Goldstein. Rather ironically, Goldstein birthed the ‘dirty martini manicure’ trend back in the fall while she was pregnant. “I created this manicure while I was still pregnant in October and I was looking forward to having a dirty martini,” she explains. “I also think dirty martinis are the perfect holiday cocktail.” How did she craft a dirty martini manicure? Goldstein used gel polish, mixing an olive color, CND Shellac in Olive Grove, into the CND Shellac Base Coat to create the cloudy olive base. She topped the first layer with a CND Shellac Matte Top Coat to get a “frosted glass” effect and rimmed the tips in a micro French style using CND Shellac in Black Pool, going over it with silver chrome powder to create a glass-like edge. You could stop there. But the olives are the pièce de résistance. Goldstein created 3D olives on her middle and index fingers using a thin brush tool and CND Brisa Glass Hard Sculpting Gel. She painted her olive shapes with a coat of CND Olive Grove (on its own, not diluted with a top coat) and used CND Shellac in Maple Leaves for the pimento accent. Finally, she sealed the olive in place using the CND No Wipe Top Coat. View this post on Instagram A post shared by CND™ (@cndworld) Of course, if sculptural 3D olives are not in your wheelhouse (or your go-to nail artist’s), 2D olives are an easy pivot. You can also get creative with your base color. For example, Bieber’s nail artist riffed on this concept using a baby-blue base instead of a translucent-olive one. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Zola Ganzorigt (@nailsbyzola) Another option is using green glitter alongside a glossy olive design, which makes the look a little more festive. Goldstein recommends placing olive accents on the index, middle, finger, or thumb. View this post on Instagram A post shared by AKIKO Nails 〰️ NYC (@akikonails_nyc) Or, consider a green chrome manicure with a pimento-like accent right in the center of each nail. View this post on Instagram A post shared by AKIKO Nails 〰️ NYC (@akikonails_nyc) However you slice it, the olive-martini manicure is hot right now. It’s trendy without being too overtly festive. Plus, it’s a good conversation starter at your holiday party. You already know what drink you’re ordering. Like what you see?

    "title": "My Boyfriend Gave Me a Brazilian Wax and It Was an Experience",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/boyfriend-brazilian-wax-personal-essay-47478089",
    "description": "Image Source: Getty If there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I am a creature of habit. In 2020 and the four years prior, I had a standing Brazilian appointment at European Wax Center and you could find me there, like clockwork, every four weeks. I was always told that, no matter what, I shouldn't try shaving in between waxes because it would make the next session more painful. When my city closed all nonessential businesses at the start of the pandemic, I held out for a little over a month before coming to the realization that I was going to have to shave. I had always dutifully listened to my aesthetician's advice, but I was at the point where I couldn't take it much longer. My first attempt at shaving went terribly. I was not prepared for how spiky and sharp my hair would feel post-shave, the nicks and cuts, or the feeling that with one wrong move I would suffer from severe rug burn due to my vagina stubble. Also, I wasn't even going to attempt shaving the hair back there. Putting a razor in an area I could barely see without a mirror? No, thank you. Swearing off shaving for good left me with two choices: grow out a full bush or learn how to DIY a Brazilian wax. Thinking back to everything I knew about DIY waxing, one anecdote stuck in my mind. During one of my past waxing appointments, in an effort to make the waxing experience a little less awkward, I asked my aesthetician if she got waxed or waxed herself. \"Don't ever try waxing yourself,\" she told me sternly. \"One time a girl came in here after trying that, but the wax had dried on her hair because she was too scared to pull it off. She was lucky we were able to get it off. She was about 30 minutes away from having to go to the hospital.\" This story ran through my head every time I considered giving myself an at-home wax. I knew I was brave, but just how brave? Was I \"rip my pubic hair off with hot wax\" brave? I wasn't sure. With that thought in mind, I realized I needed backup. I considered my options. I could call my mother, but she couldn't do much more than cheer me on through FaceTime. Could I ask a friend who lived down the street? My cousin? The answer sat there on the couch next to me, watching \"Homeland.\" My boyfriend. Yes, he would be the one to go into battle with me. We could do this together. \"Would you be willing to give me a Brazilian wax?\" I asked him. \"Sure,\" he said noncommittally. My eyes lit up as the wheels in my brain started turning. A few days later when I brought up his everlasting love for me and his commitment to help me wax my nether regions, he was still game. I already owned the Bliss Poetic Waxing Hair Removal Kit ($13) that had great reviews online. One of my coworkers had even tried it herself and noted that it was one of the less painful kits she had tried, albeit messy. Image Source: Amazon.com There were a few things I opted not to tell my boyfriend prior to beginning our waxing experience together. The first was that my aesthetician had given me the nickname \"The Flincher\" because every time she applied hot wax I would flinch. I figured my boyfriend would figure this out on his own. The second was that I was on my period. I had been waxed plenty of times while on my period, and I did what I normally did - showered and made sure I had a fresh tampon in. Again, I filed this under the \"things my boyfriend would soon find out\" category. Prior to beginning, I read the wax kit's instructions in their entirety, and decided my boyfriend should hear them as well. As I sat there explaining the laundry list of tips to him, I could see everything going in one ear and out the other as his eyes glazed over. Figuring our best bet was just to dive right in, I shut up and decided to get to it. The first thing we did was set up our space. I looked around for an area I could lay on that was about the height of a massage table, and my eyes landed on our kitchen counter. Not the most sanitary, but desperate times call for desperate measures. I laid two bath towels down and brought my full-length mirror into the kitchen, where I set it against the fridge. Just because I was willing to let a licensed aesthetician do her magic with my eyes closed, did not mean my boyfriend was going down there unsupervised with hot wax in hand. The waxing kit we used needed to be heated up in the microwave in 30 second intervals, which felt like a lifetime. Both of us were nervous, and by the time we hit our fifth minute, I was worried my boyfriend was going to lock himself in a bathroom and refuse to come out. Finally, after the sixth minute, the wax seemed hot enough to apply. I hopped up on the kitchen counter and butterflied my legs. At this point in time, my confidence was beginning to sway, and I could feel myself starting to sweat. Who did I think I was? The girl who hopped on the kitchen island 10 seconds ago and butterflied her legs without a care in the world was not the same girl staring at me in the mirror. I was not a professional, and neither was my boyfriend. Since I had a little more experience, I decided to attempt it on my own at first. I took deep breaths and tried to calm myself down. I mixed the wax and began spreading it over a patch of hair. My boyfriend came over and held my back so I could relax against his arms while I pulled the first strip. When it came time to do the actual pulling, I was a mess. My hands were sweating and my brain was melting at the thought of ripping this hair out. Seeing my hesitation, my boyfriend tried cheering me on: \"Just rip it like a Band-Aid!\" When that didn't work, he decided it was time to take the reins. He told me to lay back and get comfortable, and he got to work. As you can imagine, the first few strips were shocking, but eventually we got into a rhythm. We got through the rest of the waxing fairly painlessly (OK, as \"painless\" as a Brazilian wax done by someone who has never done it before can get), with my boyfriend stopping occasionally to ask questions. He quickly adopted the motto of \"scoop and spread\" when applying the wax, as well as \"breathe in, breathe out\" when pulling strips of wax. Toward the end, I was actually starting to feel like I was in a salon. A very inexpensive, not totally sanitary, and unlicensed salon. Overall, while I did find myself stressed out for much of the experience, I also found myself laughing 99 percent of the time. I am truly proud of the fact that my boyfriend was able to handle this task in stride with a very minimal amount of complaining. We've since broken up, (unrelated to the waxing, I swear) and although I was pulling wax off of my butt in the shower for two days afterward, I would probably do it again. Also, the kit was only $23, and my boyfriend's labor was free, so cheers to that! Renee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.

    "description": "More than 20 years since the debut of the original, director Ridley Scott has gifted fans the much-anticipated sequel to the classic film \"Gladiator.\" With a star-studded cast (Paul Mescal, Denzel Washington, Pedro Pascal, and more), \"Gladiator II\" follows the story of a young gladiator ousted from his home as he fights to free the Roman people from tyrannical rule. With spectacular performances from the internet's boyfriends, action-packed fighting scenes, and loads of blood, sweat, and tears, \"Gladiator II\" is not to be missed this holiday season. Here, the film's makeup designer, Jana Carboni, breaks down how the warriors got their war paint. Experts Featured in This Article Jana Carboni is the makeup designer of \"Gladiator II.\" She's also worked on movies such as \"House of Gucci,\" \"Napoleon,\" and \"Underground.\" Paul Mescal as Lucius Paul Mescal portrays the main character, Lucius, a prisoner captured by the Roman army who is forced to become a gladiator in the Colosseum. Because his character did not spend most of his life in Rome, Carboni designed Mescal's tan to look a little rough. She created an allover glow with a dewy finish, using Juara's Candlenut Glow Body Oil ($65) as the base for the body (\"A fantastic body oil,\" she says) and then adding sun protection with the Supergoop Glow Stick SPF 50 ($30). The fake blood was important to get just right, which meant they had to get a customized shade for all the actors. \"I've always found [fake] blood sometimes looks too red or orange, and I want it to look more brown-red. I made the blood myself because I had a very unique vision for 'Gladiator II,'\" Carboni says. Carboni explains that because Mescal and many of the actors performed their own stunts, the makeup, fake blood, and scars had to withstand the heat - and the \"Gladiator\" fights. \"It was quite intense,\" she says. \"There's a lot of blood happening, so it was important to have a good base of makeup underneath [it]. The oil helped me when I needed to remove things; [the fake blood, tan, and scars] weren't stuck on the skin.\" Pedro Pascal as General Acacius For Pedro Pascal, Carboni opted to go in a different direction. Pascal embodies General Acacius, a commander of the Roman army who's lived a lavish lifestyle. Though disillusioned with the war, Pascal's character still needed to look the part of a great Roman general: \"I wanted him to look like an iconic actor from the '40s,\" Carboni says. \"He had grooming for his perfect face, like a statue. We had strokes of gray in his hair and his beard, and [it was] very nostalgic in a way. He would say, 'I never looked so good in my life.' It was a huge compliment and very sweet.\" Pascal's tan was a bit more groomed than Mescal's. Along with many of the other actors, he received his own customized shade match. Carboni used the Embryolisse Beauty Oil ($30) to prep his skin before applying makeup. Denzel Washington as Macrinus Denzel Washington plays Macrinus, a former gladiator who now owns his own group of fighters, including Mescal's Lucius. The actor's own groom team prepared Washington to enliven the calculating and ambitious Macrinus with fun and glamour. Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger as Emperors Geta and Caracalla Emperors Geta and Caracalla (depicted by Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger, respectively) corrupt Rome with their authoritarian rule. Their two characters don the most makeup to differentiate themselves from the working class and poor. For emperor Caracalla, the goal was to channel British singer Johnny Rotten. Carboni took that rocker inspiration and softened Caracalla with white face makeup, blushed cheeks, and red lips. To juxtapose with his brother, Carboni pulled inspo from David Bowie and the Italian film \"Satyricon\" to craft Geta's more pronounced and aggressive look. She contoured him to demonstrate his dominance and flaunt his power. \"At this time, men weren't afraid about wearing makeup; makeup was a tool to prove their power,\" she says. \"They wear their makeup with pride.\" To ensure the makeup would go on smoothly, their skin was prepped with Le Domaine's The Cream ($242). Connie Nielsen as Lucilla Reprising her role from the inaugural \"Gladiator\" film, Connie Nielsen plays Lucilla, the daughter of fallen emperor Marcus Aurelius, and General Acacius's wife. Carboni aimed to differentiate her aesthetic from the original film. \"We felt that she was a strong, wild woman, but still an empress in a way,\" says Carboni. \"[In those times] being pale was in fashion. Her being tan and sun-kissed was her way of rebelling.\" Lucilla's blond hair was styled in beachy waves to match her golden tan and minimal makeup. Carboni reveals Nielsen harnessed LED therapy with the CurrentBody LED Light Therapy Mask ($469) every morning before filming.
