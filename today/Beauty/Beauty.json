    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/teddy-blonde-hair-color-trend?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "The moment summer arrives, I ask myself one question: How blonde is too blonde? This season, however, my normal desire to go as bright as the sun has been softened, partly thanks to conversations around ‚Äòrecession blonde‚Äô, which embraces more lived-in looks for the warmer months. While the top line might be about saving money (less bleach = fewer salon visits), the move towards a more relaxed blonde is exactly what my over-processed hair has been crying out for ‚Äî and one particular shade has piqued my interest. Enter: ‚Äúteddy‚Äù blonde. What is the teddy blonde hair color? If you‚Äôve taken one look at Pinterest lately, you‚Äôll know that soft, grown-out blondes are everywhere, and no color is more popular than teddy blonde ‚Äî a shade said to resemble the golden nuances of a teddy bear‚Äôs fur. The color has been spotted on celebrities like Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Sofia Richie Grainge, who have left their bleached lengths behind to embrace more honey-hued, natural shades like this one. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rosie HW (@rosiehw) According to Emily Payne, a colorist at George Northwood salon in London, the shade is defined by golden, warmer tones rather than the cool ashy ones we‚Äôve been seeing recently: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more depth to the blonde,‚Äù Payne told me, adding, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just a bleach blonde ‚Äî there are much richer tones within it.‚Äù As such, it‚Äôs more of a low-maintenance blonde, as it can incorporate your natural color in between the lighter strands. Payne cites cost and busy schedules as reasons behind people seeking more low-effort looks, but she also thinks that hair health is a key component: ‚ÄúI think a lot of people are trying to be in their healthy girl era and don‚Äôt want to bleach their hair as much as they used to do,‚Äù Payne told me. ‚ÄúEven brunettes, who maybe had highlights or balayage, want to go back to more of their natural color,‚Äù she reports. View this post on Instagram A post shared by ùëÆùíçùíêùíìùíö ùëπùíêùíîùíÜ (@curly.glorii) What is the process to dye your hair teddy blonde? As a blonde already, I was keen to know how the teddy blonde process would differ from my usual bleach and tone. According to Payne, it depends on how much blonde is already in the hair: ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs a lot of blonde and you want to add dimension, you can weave in more of the client‚Äôs natural color throughout the strands,‚Äù says Payne, much like this look on Glory Rose. She refers to the process as ‚Äúreverse balayage‚Äù, essentially hand-painting dashes of darker hues. As we were starting from a grown-out bleach balayage, Payne began by adding some reverse balayage to the back, which would help tone down some of the bright blonde and introduce more golden tones. Then she applied some sporadic bleach pieces to refresh the existing color and make the newly dyed pieces pop against the lowlights. Then we moved to the front of my hair, where we started to pack on the color, layering neat foils of bleach highlights around the top and sides, each interspersed with reverse balayage lowlights to add depth. Instead of using permanent dye for the lowlights, Payne reached for salon favorite, Redken Shades EQ gloss, which fades out naturally and doesn‚Äôt leave behind regrowth lines. Even better? It‚Äôs less harsh on your strands: ‚ÄúA gloss is an updated version of a toner, where the color is a little bit more sheer and adds a shine as it closes down the hair cuticle post-dye,‚Äù Payne explains. Once all the highlights and lowlights were in, Payne layered on another slightly darker gloss at the backwash to soften the blonde pieces and to create a more golden sheen near the roots. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Angelica Adam√© | Stockton Balayage Specialist ü§é (@jellythecosmo) Is teddy blonde suitable for both light and dark hair? Viral trends like this one won‚Äôt work for every hair colou, or it could take a while to get there. According to Payne, achieving the perfect teddy blonde requires starting from a handful of specific base colors: ‚ÄúFor this look to work best, you would need to start from a ‚Äòdirty‚Äô blonde, dark blonde or light brown shade,‚Äù says Payne. For those with a darker base, Payne says that it‚Äôs possible to lift the hair to a richer, more caramel tone that‚Äôs similar but not as light. How long does teddy blonde hair last? The main appeal of teddy blonde is that it requires very little effort. For me, the looming feeling of having to get my roots done is never a fun one. Seeing a darker root emerging is something I‚Äôve enjoyed, but anything that requires less work was always going to be a win for me.¬† That said, it‚Äôs still hair color, so with that in mind, how often do you need to refresh teddy blonde? ‚ÄúTo start with, I would say every three months,‚Äù suggests Payne, but because it‚Äôs slightly darker than your average blonde, you might be able to stretch it to three or even four months. That‚Äôs all thanks to the lowlights, says Payne: As time goes on, the lowlights will gradually penetrate deeper into the hair shaft and bond more strongly over time, making the shade last longer. At the same time, any bleach will relax and soften, says Payne. The appeal of the softer, lived-in look is that it fades more naturally. In other words, if you choose not to refresh it over the summer, it won‚Äôt look severe come fall. How do you best maintain teddy blonde hair? While teddy blonde is low-maintenance, it still deserves some love. Payne suggests investing in a deeply hydrating shampoo and conditioner: ‚ÄúI always recommend the Pureology Hydrate range, and the Hydrate Nourishing Superfoods Treatment Hair Mask is lovely, too.‚Äù How do you style teddy blonde hair? Styling is equally important to maximize the nuances of teddy blonde: ‚ÄúA lot of the reference photos people bring in are of that ‚Äò90s bouncy blowdry, which really does complement the color,‚Äù says Payne. Adding, ‚ÄúI also think using your natural texture works great, especially if you have beachy waves or natural curls, because the blonde bits really pop and the darker pieces will create more dimension.‚Äù While I usually wear my hair brushed out or in a slicked-back ponytail, Payne recommends enhancing natural waves with a hair cream (try Olaplex No. 6 Bond Smoother Frizz Control Styling Hair Cream) to help define strands, smooth hair and limit frizz. For curly hair, her top pick is the Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream, which nourishes parched strands and imparts shine, all while enhancing your natural curl pattern. To elevate the shade, hairdresser Harry Payne recommended cutting in some texture to amp up the ‚Äòlived in‚Äô look. He took inspiration from ‚Äò00s icons like Sienna Miller and Kate Moss, making my hair more piecey at the front with subtle curtain bangs. Now I get those soft, flowy pieces around my face even when I wear my hair up. Payne‚Äôs top tip: Tuck the bangs behind your ears when your hair is damp to achieve the perfect C-bend shape when dry.¬† What‚Äôs teddy blonde like IRL? I expected something super warm, but teddy blonde turned out much more subtle on me. The dark blonde tones woven through the honey blonde hues suited my complexion way better than the bleach blonde I‚Äôd outgrown. The gloss made my hair feel heavenly soft, and teamed with a much-needed cut, it left my hair feeling so much healthier. What‚Äôs more, the added layers somehow made my hair look longer and thicker. Since I‚Äôm on a mission to grow my hair out this year, it was much appreciated.¬† Bounding into the office, I was met with cries of ‚ÄúIt looks so natural!‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt suits you so well!‚Äù, confirming my feeling that the color was a good match for me. While the sun is likely to brighten the tones slightly over the summer, I know that I can go back to tone my hair at any time, without having to spend hours in the salon chair. Better still, it will look even more natural as it starts to grow out. Teddy blonde is a triumph, if you ask me.¬† This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/air-drying-sleeping-wet-hair-mold?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Mold makes an appearance in beauty products more often than we like to admit, whether it‚Äôs a brand that has formulated its moisturizer without preservatives (they‚Äôre essential for keeping bacteria at bay) or storing your makeup in a hot and steamy bathroom (the optimum environment for microorganisms to thrive in). And while mold can turn up pretty much anywhere, you‚Äôd assume that your skin is safe. But that hasn‚Äôt stopped TikTok from falling down something of a rabbit hole lately. Whether you‚Äôre a chronic scroller or open the app every once in a while, you might‚Äôve seen this viral video posted by content creator Kaley aka @allthingskaley. An enormous 21.8 million people already have, and the phrase ‚Äúhair mold‚Äù is trending as a result. In the clip, Kaley says that she blow-dries her hair as soon as she gets out of the shower so that she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt get mold‚Äù. At first it caused confusion but then came a handful of comments from people who do the very same. The common school of thought? That air-drying your hair ‚Äî or going to sleep with wet hair ‚Äî can encourage mold to grow on your scalp.¬† @allthingskaley Have you heard of hair mold? I‚Äôm actually terrified now üò≥ #hairmold #preventhairmold #howtopreventhairmold #whatishairmold ‚ô¨ Funny video ‚ÄúCarmen Prelude‚Äù Arranging weakness(836530) ‚Äì yo suzuki(akisai) As expected, TikTok began to panic. ‚ÄúWhat does hair mold look like????‚Äù asked one commenter. Another wrote, ‚ÄúI have never heard of hair mold until now‚Ä¶I‚Äôm also terrified!!!‚Äù Can mold grow in your hair and on your scalp?¬† In my 10 years of beauty experience, I‚Äôve never come across hair mold. So is it really a thing? And should you be worried? I put the question to a trichologist and a dermatologist with a specialism in hair.¬† First of all, it pays to understand what mold actually is. Molds are fungi, which feed off moisture. They can be harmful, and people with health issues may be sensitive to certain types. In moist environments, mold can technically grow anywhere, but is air-drying ‚Äî or sleeping with wet hair ‚Äî likely to cause it on your scalp or in your hair strands?¬† ‚ÄúIn short, no,‚Äù says Dr. Sharon Wong, consultant dermatologist and British Skin Foundation spokesperson. ‚ÄúMold that you find in the air or on damp walls and surfaces is caused by a variety of different fungal species, and they are not the same as the yeasts that live naturally on human scalps,‚Äù she says.¬† What is malassezia ‚Äî and how does it affect the scalp? Before we get into the nitty gritty, it‚Äôs important to note that said yeasts are totally normal. A common yeast that lives on our scalp is called malassezia, explains trichologist Eva Proudman FIT IAT. It‚Äôs different from mold but, says Dr. Wong, ‚ÄúThe combination of damp hair together with the heat emitted from the scalp surface creates the perfect warm, moist environment that encourages overgrowth of malassezia.‚Äù Proudman explains that when the malassezia yeast becomes overactive (usually the result of excess oil on the scalp), it can lead to dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis, a type of scalp eczema. So what‚Äôs the difference? ‚ÄúDandruff causes loose white flakes that fall easily onto the shoulders, and in many cases does not itch,‚Äù says Proudman. ‚ÄúSeborrhoeic dermatitis causes the flakes to turn yellow as they feed off of oil, and for them to sit on the scalp and within the hair,‚Äù she continues. ‚ÄúSeborrhoeic dermatitis is also usually itchy and causes inflammation on the scalp.‚Äù¬† While there is no ‚Äúcure‚Äù for dandruff, washing your hair more frequently ‚Äî and starting off with an anti-dandruff shampoo like Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Daily Prevent Shampoo, $15.88, or Verb Dandruff Shampoo with Salicylic Acid for Dry and Flaky Scalp, $22 ‚Äî can help. Regularly washing your hair is also recommended to treat seborrhoeic dermatitis, as it thrives in oily environments.¬†¬†¬† Can mold grow on your pillow? While it‚Äôs very unlikely that mold can grow on your hair and scalp, your pillows and pillowcases are not exempt, says Proudman. ‚Äú[These] will absorb moisture and become damp from wet hair, which can lead to the fabrics becoming smelly and developing mold,‚Äù she says. If you do sleep with wet hair, Proudman recommends changing your pillowcase daily and ensuring that the pillow is always dry. If you head to bed with dry hair, Dr. Wong suggests changing your pillowcase once a week.¬† Is it best to air-dry or blow-dry your hair after washing? Ultimately, whether you blow-dry your hair, let it air-dry or sleep with it wet is entirely down to personal preference, but from a dermatologist‚Äôs point of view, it‚Äôs best to dry hair thoroughly before going to bed. ‚ÄúNot just for better scalp health,‚Äù says Dr. Wong, ‚Äúbut also because your hair is at its weakest when wet and therefore most prone to breakage in this state.‚Äù Proudman agrees: ‚ÄúWet hair can easily be broken, so I always advise to go to sleep with dry hair for both scalp and hair health.‚Äù Depending on your length and hair texture, Dr. Wong considers air-drying to be time-consuming, but it‚Äôs also impractical for a lot of people, especially if you wash your hair in the evening. She has a trick for mopping up water, though: ‚ÄúI would advise using a microfibre towel to dry the hair first, as this significantly increases water absorption and therefore [reduces] the time needed for any subsequent air-drying or heat drying.‚Äù Try Kitsch Extra Large Quick-Dry Hair Towel Wrap, $26, or the Act+Acre Microfiber Hair Towel, $30, if you have more to spend.¬† What‚Äôs the best hairdryer for no heat damage? If it‚Äôs heat damage that‚Äôs preventing you from blow-drying your hair, consider a smart blowdryer like the Shark SpeedStyle Pro FLEX 4-in-1 High-Velocity Hair Dryer System, $179.99. I also love the clever Dyson Supersonic Nural Hairdryer, $499, which uses sensors to tweak both airflow and temperature, minimizing the chance of burning your scalp and protecting hair strands in the process. If you‚Äôd rather spend less, try the BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium Compact Folding Ionic Dryer, $84.99, which boasts impressive airflow. And remember: Heat protectant spray exists for a reason.¬† Lastly, if you‚Äôre air-drying your hair, consider a targeted air-dry cream to reduce waiting time. Try JVN Complete Hydrating Air Dry Hair Styling Cream, $28, with smoothing squalane and moringa seed oil. Also try Briogeo Style + Treat Air Dry Hair Styling Cream, $26, with deeply moisturizing shea butter and glycerin, and Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream, $27, with castor and jojoba oil, both of which are perfect for curly hair but can be used on all hair types.

    "description": "Sunburn, tan lines, and sweaty skin are all things people tend to experience throughout the summer months. While protecting your skin from the sun can help prevent the more unpleasant side effects of the warm weather, some things, like heat rashes, can have a mind of their own. Whether you've personally experienced heat rashes or you know someone else who has, they can be a common problem during the summer and seemingly come out of nowhere. A heat rash is characterized by stinging or prickling skin and is exacerbated by sweat. You'll usually notice a heat rash appearing on your neck, scalp, chest, legs, and elbow crease. But what exactly is a heat rash, and why does it itch? What causes it to occur? We spoke with dermatologists to help us answer these burning (pun intended) questions and get a better understanding of heat rashes so you know what to do when one pops up. Experts Featured in This Article Kseniya Kobets, MD, MHS, FAAD, is a board-certified dermatologist. Marisa Garshick, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist and clinical assistant professor at Cornell New York Presbyterian. What Causes a Heat Rash? There are a few things that can cause a heat rash to occur; all of them are related to the increased temperature of ultraviolet radiation during the summer months. \"Heat rashes on sun-exposed areas like on the chest or arms can happen when someone is sensitive to the sun, and this reaction can sometimes be related to autoimmune disorders,\" board-certified dermatologist Kseniya Kobets says. It happens because your sweat gets trapped in the sweat ducts and can't reach the surface of the skin to evaporate. \"This blockage can cause inflammation and a rash of red bumps or blisters,\" board-certified dermatologist Marisa Garshick says. \"The condition is often a result of hot and humid weather, excessive sweating, or overheating.\" Heat rash can also occur when someone has a sensitivity or an allergy to a chemical SPF ingredient such as avobenzone, oxybenzone, or a fragrance. This can likely \"cause a reaction on skin that is hot and sweaty by penetration through pores,\" Dr. Kobets says. \"Other times, heat rashes on legs, which are more red like cayenne pepper, can be related to heat and sun, called pigmented purpuric dermatosis, which usually is a benign and self-limiting rash.\" Friton can also play a role. Heat rashes on your neck tend to happen because \"the neck is particularly vulnerable due to its exposure to the sun and tight clothing or accessories that can trap heat,\" Dr. Garshick says. These parts of your body also have a stagnant blood supply and can \"possibly cause an accumulation of immune cells\" to create the reaction of the heat rashes, Dr. Kobets says. Heat Rash Symptoms Usually, a heat rash manifests as red clusters of small blisters or pimples. But do heat rashes itch? Unfortunately, yes. Heat rashes can potentially itch, and the sensation can range from mild to severe, our dermatologists say. \"The discomfort from itching can lead to scratching, which might worsen the condition,\" Dr. Garshick says. However, it's possible that you may not experience any itchiness. \"It commonly occurs in areas where sweat is trapped under the skin, such as the back, neck, chest, groin, and armpits,\" Dr. Kobets says. \"Other symptoms may include mild swelling, stinging, and it may also be associated with pain.\" Do Heat Rashes Spread? When you think of a rash, you may figure that it will spread to other areas of your body. Luckily, heat rashes don't usually spread from one area of the body to another because they're not contagious. That said, Dr. Garshick says, \"They can cover larger areas if the conditions that caused the rash continue, such as excessive sweating or heat exposure.\" How to Get Rid of Heat Rashes To get rid of heat rashes, you'll want to keep the affected area cool and dry and wear loose, lightweight clothing. This allows your skin to breathe. \"Apply cold compresses to reduce itching and inflammation. Avoid heavy creams or ointments that can block pores and worsen the condition. Using hydrocortisone cream can soothe irritation,\" Dr. Kobets says. \"Ensure you stay hydrated and in a cool environment to prevent excessive sweating. If the heat rash persists or becomes infected, consult a healthcare professional for further treatment.\" How Long Do Heat Rashes Last? There's really no head and fast timeline when it comes to how long a heat rash will last. \"This varies depending on how quickly the skin is cooled and dried,\" Dr. Garshick says. \"Most heat rashes resolve within a few days to a week. It might take longer if the skin continues to be exposed to heat and sweat.\" Sydney Wingfield has been a freelance writer in the beauty and wellness space for six years.

    "description": "When it comes to choosing the tattoo placement for your next design, there are some areas that are naturally sexier than others. Your sternum, for example, can feel more sultry than your right bicep. Still, of all the locations, the best place has to be on your booty. That's right, sexy butt tattoos are back. So if you've been considering getting butt tattoos, you've come to the right place. You wouldn't be the only one interested in this particular tattoo trend: Halsey, Cardi B, and Teyana Taylor are among the many celebrities who've decided to embellish their bums with cheeky designs (yes, pun intended) - and it's easy to see why. For one, it's in a relatively hidden spot that not everyone will get to see. This makes the tattoo your (and anyone else you choose to show) little secret. Not to mention, the sex appeal of a tattoo is generally in its placement; the right design may end up being the best permanent reminder of just how hot you truly are. Whether you're thinking of adorning your backside with a subtle and tiny design or turning your entire butt into a hyperrealistic work of art, we've rounded up a ton of inspiration that proves a butt tattoo can also be tasteful. To check out more bum tattoo ideas, keep scrolling. Related: What to Wear to a Tattoo Appointment: Side, Back, Butt, Chest, and Hip",
