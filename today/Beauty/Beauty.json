    "description": "We love a manicure that sounds like a snack. Light blue nail polish is cuter positioned as “blueberry milk nails” and a “vanilla manicure” is more fun than a plain white one — it just is. If you’re “dry” on inspiration for your next manicure, let us introduce the biggest nail trend of the holiday season: the dirty martini manicure. What are dirty martini nails exactly? It’s not just green polish, but a specific nail art design with a subtle Spanish olive accent that has slowly taken over mood boards, worn by celebrities, like Hailey Bieber, and seen in trendy nail salons from NYC to LA. To dig deeper into the trend — and learn exactly how ask for it — we went directly to the source, the artist who created the martini olive art months before it became trendy, Betina Goldstein. Rather ironically, Goldstein birthed the ‘dirty martini manicure’ trend back in the fall while she was pregnant. “I created this manicure while I was still pregnant in October and I was looking forward to having a dirty martini,” she explains. “I also think dirty martinis are the perfect holiday cocktail.” How did she craft a dirty martini manicure? Goldstein used gel polish, mixing an olive color, CND Shellac in Olive Grove, into the CND Shellac Base Coat to create the cloudy olive base. She topped the first layer with a CND Shellac Matte Top Coat to get a “frosted glass” effect and rimmed the tips in a micro French style using CND Shellac in Black Pool, going over it with silver chrome powder to create a glass-like edge. You could stop there. But the olives are the pièce de résistance. Goldstein created 3D olives on her middle and index fingers using a thin brush tool and CND Brisa Glass Hard Sculpting Gel. She painted her olive shapes with a coat of CND Olive Grove (on its own, not diluted with a top coat) and used CND Shellac in Maple Leaves for the pimento accent. Finally, she sealed the olive in place using the CND No Wipe Top Coat. View this post on Instagram A post shared by CND™ (@cndworld) Of course, if sculptural 3D olives are not in your wheelhouse (or your go-to nail artist’s), 2D olives are an easy pivot. You can also get creative with your base color. For example, Bieber’s nail artist riffed on this concept using a baby-blue base instead of a translucent-olive one. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Zola Ganzorigt (@nailsbyzola) Another option is using green glitter alongside a glossy olive design, which makes the look a little more festive. Goldstein recommends placing olive accents on the index, middle, finger, or thumb. View this post on Instagram A post shared by AKIKO Nails 〰️ NYC (@akikonails_nyc) Or, consider a green chrome manicure with a pimento-like accent right in the center of each nail. View this post on Instagram A post shared by AKIKO Nails 〰️ NYC (@akikonails_nyc) However you slice it, the olive-martini manicure is hot right now. It’s trendy without being too overtly festive. Plus, it’s a good conversation starter at your holiday party. You already know what drink you’re ordering. Like what you see?

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find the best things to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.Friends, we’ve made it to the end of another year. Looking back at the last 12 months, there have been some major fashion and beauty moments. Who could forget Zendaya arriving at the Dune 2 London premiere in a vintage Mugler robot suit, or Tyla taking to the Met Gala red carpet in her sand-sculpted gown and matching hourglass handbag? Then there was Beyoncé leading the charge for the Western style revival with Cowboy Carter and, most recently, Alex Consani making history at the 2024 Fashion Awards (while wearing Dilara Findikoglu).On the beauty front, Pat McGrath took glass skin to a whole new level at the Maison Margiela artisanal show with a porcelain doll-inspired look, Ariana Grande sold the world on pearlized beauty when she accessorized her Loewe gown with 3D crystallized fairy wings on each eye, and Hailey Bieber sent everyone running for deep blushes when she set off yet another makeup trend.As we prepare to welcome new fashion must-haves and viral makeup looks into our lives in 2025, we’re leaving a little room for one last great 2024 discovery. There’s plenty of newness coming our way this month — see our favorite December drops in the slideshow ahead.Tibi x L.L.Bean L.L.Bean’s iconic Boat and Tote just got a high-fashion twist courtesy of Tibi. For the New York-based brand's spring 2024 runway, the two teamed up to reimagine and elevate the popular bag. Now it's finally available to shop — but only for a limited time. The Tibi x L.L.Bean Boat and Tote is made from 100 percent cotton and features an easy-to-access key ring and bottom handle so it can also be held as a clutch. The pièce de résistance? The leather belt that tops the style.Shop at Tibi Tibi x L.L.Bean The Re-imagined Boat and Tote, $, available at TibiRhode Peptide Lip Treatment in Peppermint GlazeThe virality of Hailey Bieber’s lip products cannot be understated. The nourishing balms are at the heart of her brand, Rhode. This month, Bieber is launching a new, festive flavor: peppermint. Infused with a “crushed candy cane” scent, the shimmering Peptide Lip Treatment contains all the ingredients we know and love (hydrating shea butter, fine line-busting peptides) plus a sprinkling of sparkle for added holiday cheer.Shop now at RhodeRhode Peptide Lip Treatment - Peppermint Glaze, $, available at RhodePleasing x JW AndersonHarry Styles and Harry Lambert’s lifestyle brand, Pleasing, might be best known for its sculptural nail varnishes and dreamy fragrances but it’s ticking designer apparel off the list, too, this month with a collaboration with JW Anderson. The capsule offers everything from a long-sleeved mesh shirt to a cream collared cardigan emblazoned with balloons. If you're searching for something more serious, there’s a classic JW Anderson bumper bag in a black and forest green colorway — and if it's the exact opposite you're after, allow us to direct you to the X-rated diamanté keyrings.  Shop now at PleasingPleasing x JW Anderson Bunch of Balloons Knit Cardigan, $, available at PleasingMurad Retexturizing Body PadsSkincare aficionados will be well acquainted with Murad. The brand has heard the cries of KP (keratosis pilaris) sufferers everywhere and launched a body treatment aimed at soothing inflamed bumps, body breakouts, and even pesky ingrown hairs. Providing mild exfoliation, the pads use a combination of azelaic, salicylic, and glycolic acids to calm aggravated skin and even skin tone with prolonged use. They also treat facial marks, like post-pimple-popping stains and dark spots.Murad Retexturizing Body Pads, $, available at MuradCOS x Chris PeraniCalifornia macro-photographer Chris Perani grew up surrounded by forests and marshlands, and it has greatly informed his work. Now, he's bringing his passion to a 24-piece collab with COS, lifting patterns from his images (he uses a microscopic lens to create a shallow depth of field and capture hundreds of hyper-focused exposures) and reimagining them on winter silhouettes. The scales of a butterfly wing, for example, can be seen beaded on a shirt or printed on a denim skirt.Shop now at COSCOS Printed Semi-Sheer Knitted Maxi Dress, $, available at COSL'Oréal Paris Paradise Le Shadow Stick EyeshadowThere’s only one thing on any beauty enthusiast’s mood board come the holidays: glitter. Sprinkling a bit of sparkle across the lids is a surefire way to get into the festive spirit, especially when it can be applied easily with minimal fallout. L’Oréal’s latest smudge-resistant shadow sticks offer just that with a twist-up applicator that glides easily onto the lid with plenty of precision. Take your pick from 10 pigmented shades — our favorites include Ice Sparkle (a slick silver) and Foil Copper (a warm burnt orange). If you prefer a more subtle look, why not grab one of the hydrating matte shades? Shop now at L'OréalL'Oreal Paris Paradise Le Shadow Stick, $, available at L'Oreal ParisAlaïa Le Teckel ClutchICYMI, the east-west handbag has been the accessory of the year. Named after its long, sleek shape, the must-have style is Alaïa’s Le Teckel Clutch, the latest iteration of which swaps out the long straps for small tubular handles, reimagining the silhouette as an evening clutch. Available in black goatskin leather with silver hardware, oxblood suede, or black suede with gold hardware, it’s about to be the under-the-arm bag of the moment.Shop now at AlaïaAlaia Le Teckel Clutch in Suede Goatskin, $, available at AlaiaKayali Yum Boujeee Marshmallow Kayali might be known for its woody, oud-forward scents but its Yum collection is serving the sweet-toothed among us. The latest perfume in the range is built around fluffy pink marshmallow, with top notes of fruity apple, lemon, and nectarine blossom. The middle notes stay sweet with coconut flakes and strawberry, and the scent is topped off with dry notes of whipped vanilla and raspberry sugar. Encased in the classic, diamond-shaped bottle (this time in a warm baby pink), this candy-colored creation is seriously delectable.Shop now at SephoraKayali Yum Boujee Marshmallow | 81 Eau de Parfum Intense, $, available at SephoraFarm Rio's Ski CollectionYou might not think of Farm Rio as a winter brand but it has some great cold-weather attire.

    "description": "The holidays are quickly approaching. If you are like us and don't want a repeat of last year, that means you are also staying ahead of the gift-giving game. It can be hard to figure out what to get someone for the festivities, but allow us to throw a suggestion into the ring: perfume gift sets. We know fragrance is widely subjective, but that's the beauty of a set. These perfume sets typically include more than one scent, so whoever you give the gift to will be able to select their favorite of the bunch and possibly buy the full-size version for themselves in the future. Is your recipient a fan of woody scents but not citrus ones? There's a set for that. Prefer more of a subtle aroma as opposed to one with next-level sillage? You have options. Fragrance gift sets take the pressure off finding the one perfect present, which can be tricky. They also tend to come in trial or travel sizes, allowing you to save a bit of money while still treating your loved one to something special - a win-win. Some even allow you to purchase samples and give you a voucher that you can exchange for a full size of your favorite scent. Others come with more substantial travel sizes that are perfect for a quick trip or to just keep in your work or gym bag. Whether you are shopping for someone special or just feel a good treat-yourself moment coming on, we've got perfume gift sets for women, cologne options for men, and much more. Trust us, the editor-approved perfume gift sets ahead will make your holiday shopping (and gifting) a breeze.",
