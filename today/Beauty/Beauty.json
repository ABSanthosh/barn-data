If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Peptides are, without a doubt, the most talked-about skincare ingredient at the moment, racking up 2.6 million Google searches in the past month alone. These skin-strengthening proteins are popping up in everything from moisturizers to lip liners, thanks to their ability to improve skin elasticity and signal the brain to boost collagen production. Paula’s Choice is the latest brand to add to the hype with its newest launch, the Pro-Collagen Peptide Plumping Moisturizer, $49. Known for its 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant — a favorite in beauty editor circles — Paula’s Choice specializes in results-driven skincare. Its new moisturizer features a tri-peptide complex that claims to enhance the skin’s firmness and resilience, in addition to providing long-lasting hydration. Ahead, we put this fresh launch to the test, and share our honest thoughts on whether this lightweight product is worth your investment. DashDividers_1_500x100 What are pro-collagen peptides and what are their skincare benefits? Peptides are short chains of amino acids that act as messengers for your skin to stimulate collagen and elastin, which keeps your skin firm, smooth and hydrated. They also help strengthen the skin barrier, improve moisture retention and protect your skin against environmental damage. Paula’s Choice’s new moisturizer brings together three types of pro-collagen peptides: hexapeptide-5, oligopeptide-1, and trideca peptide-1. According to Dr Olha Vorodukhina, aesthetics trainer and founder of Angels Twelve Clinic, these refer to the number of amino acids in the chain (“hexapeptide” correlates six, for example). Dr Magnus Lynch, Harley Street consultant dermatologist and surgeon, says “There has been some evidence that pro-collagen peptides may help to boost collagen synthesis and reinforce the skin’s protective barrier, [which] helps the skin retain moisture [even] more effectively, leading to improved hydration, elasticity and resilience.” DashDividers_1_500x100 Paula’s Choice Pro-Collagen Peptide Plumping Moisturizer, $49 I’m personally elated to see a winter skincare launch that’s lightweight for a change. My combination-sensitive skin has been breaking out from all the rich, nourishing face oils and creams I’ve been slathering on all season. I’ve been eager to switch to a moisturizer that doesn’t overwhelm and clog my pores but still delivers all the hydration my skin desperately requires at this time of year. This one, with its gel-like texture, felt plumping and calming on my face right out of the gate. Jacqueline Kilikita, Refinery29’s beauty director, is also a fan of the texture: “The consistency of this moisturizer — a lightweight gel cream that absorbs quickly — is perfect for my combination, acne-prone skin. It’s substantially hydrating and nixes that tight, uncomfortable feeling you get after cleansing almost immediately.” Is the Paula’s Choice peptide moisturizer any good? My skin barrier is typically quite vulnerable to cold and dry weather; I often have to top up my moisturizer throughout the day to quell that uncomfortable feeling of tightness and dehydration. This peptide one, however, leaves my skin hydrated for hours on end without feeling oily. Because of its fast-absorbing nature, I often forget that I’m wearing it; at the same time, my skin stays bouncy, plump and smooth all day — no reapplication required. Paula’s Choice claims that this peptide moisturizer can provide hydration for up to 24 hours, and while I haven’t tested that for myself, I’m inclined to believe it. The moisturising qualities can be attributed to the peptide trio, each working overtime to promote water retention: Hexapeptide-5 binds moisture to the skin, while oligopeptide-1 signals your brain to produce more collagen and tridecapeptide-1 helps with plumping fine lines. Kilikita has the perfect anecdote to back this up: “Since using it, I’m convinced that my forehead has become much smoother; the lines underneath my eyes have also filled out slightly,” she says. “At a blowdry recently, my hairstylist would not stop complimenting me on how illuminated and healthy my skin looked. As someone who’s sworn off Botox, this is a welcome surprise and proves that topical solutions can make a visible difference.” Both of us find that this moisturizer creates a lovely, seamless base for makeup: I’ve been able to apply my foundation over it without any pilling and creasing, and my base makeup has a smoother, more naturally “airbrushed” look. This product also sits very nicely under sunscreen. In fact, sunscreen is a given when you’re using a peptide product. “While peptides are generally well tolerated, they work best in combination with sun protection, as UV exposure can break down collagen,” Dr Lynch says. The Paula’s Choice Resist Hydrating Fluid SPF 50, $39, is my go-to for dry weather. The pump mechanism is also super convenient, since you can get the product out without dunking your fingers in (and polluting it with bacteria in the process). “While my bathroom shelf is overflowing with moisturizers, I’ve been using this one consistently — and I will do so right down to the last drop,” Kilikita says. I’m 100% right there with her. Shop our favorite Paula’s Choice skincare Like what you see?

    "description": "From The Hair Bros to Charlotte Mensah’s Hairlounge, London is home to some truly excellent hair salons — something that becomes especially evident at London Fashion Week when the city’s most stylish descend on the streets. Last season, we spotted street stylers with choppy bobs, mid-length chops, and long layers aplenty. This time around, the cuts are proving just as cool and effortless. Whether you’re keen for a total hair refresh or prefer something subtle, let the best haircut trends from London Fashion Week street style inspire you. All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK.The “snack-size” bob, aka the “kick” bob, is a short, sharp style that grazes the jawline and flicks out at the ends. We love the addition of the thick, stretchy headband. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Another day, another bob — and no, we’re not tired of them yet. This sleek, slicked-back style shows that short cuts can be styled in endless ways.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Curls and layers are a perfect pair, and here’s all the proof you need.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Say hello to the midi-flick: a mid-length cut with flicked, kicked-out ends. The slightly wet finish is an edgy final touch.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.The French bob has ruled both the runways and street style this season. This deep side parting is the perfect finishing touch.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Embellished balaclava? Bow-adorned plaits? It's safe to say that this is one of the most eye-catching looks we came across at London Fashion Week. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Add a little flair to a mid-length cut with embellished hair slides, just like this LFW guest.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.A blunt cut creates the illusion of fuller hair. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.We've lost count of the straight-across fringes seen at London Fashion Week, proving the style is well on its way to dethroning curtain bangs.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Hairstylists agree: Choppy pixie cuts are poised to dominate in the coming months. This style boasts a textured fringe and edges for an accidentally perfect finish. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.The best way to show off curls and ringlets? A towering updo, of course.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Brushed-out natural textures are reigning supreme on and off the catwalk this season. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Introducing the “mixie” — a mullet and pixie hybrid. “It’s essentially an outgrown pixie with soft edges around the hairline,” Anita Rice, hairstylist and cofounder of Buller + Rice told R29 recently. “The length at the back can be kept longer to create a wolf cut variation,” she added.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Speaking of the “wolf” cut, this style features choppy layers, flicked-out ends, and a textured fringe.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Hairstylists predicted that the modern curly mullet would dominate 2025 — and it seems they were right. We’re obsessed with the chocolate cherry color here, too. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.The micro fringe, sharp blunt ends, and painterly auburn highlights made a statement this weekend.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.These “bottleneck” bangs, essentially a fringe that occupies a cozy space between a curtain fringe and a fuller fringe, complement this guest’s layered, mid-length cut perfectly. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Isabella Charlotta Poppius showcases how face-framing layers and caramel highlights can add dimension and elegance to long hair. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Mid-length styles are back. These curly micro braids spotted on a guest this weekend are beautiful. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Ask your hairstylist for “invisible” layers — a subtle cutting technique that adds volume and movement without compromising length. It involves strategically placing a few shorter layers underneath while keeping the top section the same for a seamless, natural look.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Meet the “boxie”, a cross between the bob and pixie haircut. The choppy fringe and ‘90s highlights are the cherry on top of this unique style. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.The beveled bob is so back. It’s a sharp jaw-length cut tucked under either using a straightener (try ghd Chronos Max, $349) or a heated round brush. It’s the ultimate style to pair with an oversized collar. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Hip-grazing goddess braids were spotted at New York Fashion Week — and now in London. If you want to head in the complete opposite direction, consider the goddess braid bob. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.The “mod” bob, the “mushroom” bob, the bowl cut… Whatever you call this spherical style, there’s an air of the ‘60s to it — but the slightly parted, straight-across fringe lends this particular chop a modern edge. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.This is picture proof that side fringes are versatile. We love the soft, piecey texture of this look combined with the bold red highlights.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Natural hair is taking center stage on London’s streets and runways this week, making waves at Fashion East, Harris Reed, and Richard Quinn.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Protective styles, like these stunning Koroba braids, have been turning heads both on and off the runways this season.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.We love this choppy fringe and the even edgier, textured layers.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.We're obsessed with this cut, dubbed the \"boyfriend” bob by stylists. It's short, sharp, and effortlessly undone, with shorter front pieces adding a touch of ‘90s boyband floppiness.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Like what you see?

    "description": "The 2025 Screen Actors Guild Awards brought a slew of awe-inspiring moments, from Timothée Chalamet's surprise win to Jane Fonda's call for collective action as she accepted the Lifetime Achievement award. But of course, as beauty-obsessed viewers, our eyes were on the red-carpet beauty. For the monumental night, celebrities leaned into referential looks that made a statement while remaining effortless. Understated makeup was a noteworthy theme, with Pamela Anderson wearing no makeup to showcase her glowy skin and Demi Moore wearing light-coverage foundation and a neutral lip. Old Hollywood glamour also dominated the night, from blond wavy bobs to our favorite trend: red lips. Stars like Keke Palmer, Selena Gomez, and Mikey Madison all stunned while wearing red lipstick, and that might've been more than coincidental. Sure, the captivating lip choice has been a beauty favorite for decades, but last night's display shows how intentional wearing red lipstick has become, thanks to TikTok's \"red lip theory.\" For those unaware, the concept (popularized by The Lipstick Lesbians) is the theory that a red lip worn with no other makeup can make your skin look even and heighten your confidence. \"A throwback version of lip theory, popularized by classic French beauty, is the idea that a red lip can instantly make you look more sophisticated and pulled together,\" makeup artist and beauty expert Ehlie Luna says. \"A red lip is a makeup power move no matter which theory you follow, and considering the current political climate in the US, it makes total sense that it was trending on the red carpet.\" @maj.beauty Brb making red lips my new personality ❤️‍🔥😅 #makeuptips #makeuphacks #beautytips #beautyhacks #redliptheory #redliptrend #redlipstick #redlipstickgirl #redlipliner #redlipstickhack #beautytips #beautyhack #makeuptipstiktok #makeuptips101 @The Lipstick Lesbians @Kosas ♬ original sound - MAJ 🖤 Though it's unknown if Palmer, Gomez, or Madison chose the crimson for this specific reason, it wouldn't be a surprise if they did. Celebrities have increasingly used their platforms to make political statements and advocate for what they believe in. Given the country's current political state, especially in regards to women's rights and bodily autonomy, wearing a red lip to a major awards show is an opportunity to do more than just offer up an aesthetically pleasing beauty moment. The act says that you command attention and are assured of yourself - something that all of the stars who wore the trend embody. Whether you're feeling inspired by BeautyTok or simply looking to elevate your routine with the powerful hue, keep scrolling to see all of the celebrities who nailed red lip theory on last night's carpet - plus some of their exact shades to shop.",

    "description": "When it comes to sourcing new beauty inspiration, we can always count on awards season to introduce us to a new product or show-stopping trend. This year, we're seeing the return of some old favorites - like Taylor Swift's trusted red lip and the controversial jellyfish haircut - alongside a slew of new celeb-approved beauty products, including some affordable surprises (we're talking under $20!). While celebrity glam is more typically associated with high-end, luxury beauty products, many celebrities opt to use more budget-friendly products for their red carpet looks. Selena Gomez opted for a $16 cleanser to prep her skin; Charli XCX tamed her voluminous curls with the help of a $9 styling creme; and even Miley Cyrus relied on an $11 lip tint to perfect her award-show pout. Ahead, we rounded up the best affordable beauty products under $40 that today's biggest stars relied on for the 2025 Awards season. From drugstore favorites to hair-care staples to plenty of editor-approved skin-care products, these beauty must haves will make it easy to achieve an A-list glam - even if you're on a budget.
