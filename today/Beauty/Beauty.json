    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/embracing-femininity-masculinity-personal-essay-49429845",
    "description": "It's difficult to pinpoint the exact moment I learned that who I am at my core wasn't what the world wanted from someone born a boy. As far back as I can remember, I've been labeled feminine. How I walked, talked, moved, held a pencil, or even laughed seemed to invite commentary, ridicule, and insult. I understood very early on as a child that the things I naturally gravitated toward - softness, creativity, beauty - were considered for girls and therefore not meant for me. But for me, femininity didn't feel soft. It felt powerful. I was mesmerized watching my mother transform with a fresh blowout, her makeup like war paint, her carefully chosen outfits exuding confidence. To my young mind, femininity was a kind of armor - unwavering, knowing, and sharp as steel in a world set up to see women and the feminine self as lesser than. I escaped into my imagination, developing a love for comic books like \"X-Men\" and characters like Chun Li from \"Street Fighter.\" They reinforced the notion of strong, powerful women with flowing hair, grace, and powers to match any man. Femininity was strength, beauty, and an ethereal wisdom that seemed to lack from the men I was supposed to model myself after, wrapped in one. Yet society told me otherwise: I quickly learned that boys aren't allowed to be dimensional. We're expected to be stoic, rough-edged cardboard cutouts of each other. Everything I admired and wanted to emulate as I grew up was filed under the category of \"For Girls,\" off-limits to me. Painting? For girls. Ceramics? For girls. Playing with dolls? For girls. Skipping? For girls. Singing and performing? For girls. Over time, phrases like \"Why do you talk like that?\" \"You walk like a girl,\" or \"You write like a girl,\" taught me to shrink myself. I began to internalize society's disdain for femininity, masking the parts of myself that felt natural, vibrant, and alive. By age 11, I had learned to hate everything feminine about myself. It was a survival mechanism. Each comment about my mannerisms, my voice, or interests felt like a spotlight, making me exposed and vulnerable. At new schools, instead of being asked where I was from or what games I liked, the first questions were always, \"Why do you talk like that?\" or \"Why is your handwriting so girly?\" These small, cutting observations reminded me that my genuine nature was not meant for me…a future man. When a person's identity makes them a target, they begin to hide. Not only was I unknowingly hiding my \"brownness\" as a Puerto Rican, but I was now also hiding the essence of what made me me. And hiding comes at a cost: The quote \"Desperation holds hands with degradation\" resonates with me. In my desperation to fit in, I began degrading myself - and, by extension, degrading others who were like me. My ADHD had already started to teach me how to mask early on, and now that skill was transferred to my everyday life. I began to mask so well that I completely erased who I was. I shortened the sway in my hips, deepened my voice, and learned the handshake-pat that still makes me uneasy. I puffed my chest, feigned anger when I felt vulnerable, and did everything I could to blend in with the boys who didn't have to think twice about their place in the world. I relied heavily on the character I had created throughout my 20s and into my 30s. Even with the amount of masking I did, I was still \"clocked\" as gay almost immediately by nearly every person I came into contact with my entire life. After coming out, I learned the gay community also relies heavily on heteronormative ideologies to determine worth. I relied on my ability to erase the feminine as much as possible. Makeup? Didn't know her. The first time a guy I was dating asked if I was wearing concealer, I almost fainted from embarrassment. I straightened my hair and chased the whitest, most palatable version of myself. Suffice it to say, even through all that masking, I was still seen as feminine by some standards (both gay and straight). Then, in 2019, I decided to become more transparent on social media about skin care. I started sharing tips, like how to easily hide undereye bags with concealer. Soon, cis men flocked to my DMs asking for advice: \"How do I pick a concealer?\" \"How do I wear makeup without anyone noticing?\" That's when my personal brand started to develop and where the exploration and rehabilitation of my feminine side began to bloom. But as I embraced my femininity, I also had to unpack all the ways I had internalized and perpetuated a misogynistic worldview. Rejecting femininity wasn't just about survival - it was about upholding the same rigid masculinity that complicated my life to begin with. The more I leaned into my femininity, the more I saw how masculinity - especially the toxic version that dominates so much of our culture - has harmed not just me but the entire world. It forces men into emotional repression and women into subservience. It breeds violence, control, and insecurity. And I had to admit: I was complicit. On social media, I express my gender subversively - and that's my intention. It turns the way we think about gender on its head. It is an extreme version of what someone else might experience in smaller, more personal, or more meaningful ways. Some people might never wear a wig or a full makeup beat, but they might feel a little freer in how they express themselves. And if what I do opens that door, I've done my job. View this post on Instagram A post shared by David Lopez (@davidlopezzz) In a time when some believe society is crumbling, I see it differently: I see the world being rebuilt. People are waking up, questioning old structures, and rejecting outdated roles that no longer serve them. Yes, change is uncomfortable, but it's also necessary. The backlash against gender expression, against fluidity, against anything that dares to challenge the status quo - that's the fear of a system that knows it's losing control. And that? That's progress. True masculinity isn't about dominance or suppressing vulnerability, it's about balance, authenticity, and the courage to show up as your full self. True masculinity isn't about dominance or suppressing vulnerability, it's about balance, authenticity, and the courage to show up as your full self. For me, leaning into the feminine is reclaiming my power, reconnecting with the awe I felt as a child watching my mother's strength, or marveling at the beauty and power of the characters I admired. It has allowed me to break free from the narrow box I was forced into and define manhood on my own terms. I've realized that masculinity can be expansive, not restrictive. It could hold space for softness, vulnerability, and care - qualities often mislabeled as feminine. I relearned how to connect with others, not through posturing or bravado, but through genuine emotional intimacy. The relationships I've built since shedding my many masks and dismantling the structures I created to protect myself have been richer, more fulfilling, and more authentic than I ever thought possible. By allowing myself to cry, to express fear or uncertainty, and to lean on others, put on the skirt, and let my wrist hang limp when it feels like it, I've dismantled the walls I built around myself. And in doing so, I've been able to show up for the people in my life - not as a caricature of what a man is supposed to be, but as the multifaceted, deeply human person I am. Embracing my feminine side didn't take anything away from me. It gave me everything. It made me whole. And maybe just maybe, it can do the same for you.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/keke-palmer-aura-nails-49433408",
    "description": "Keke Palmer is not only known for being a multi-hyphenate in Hollywood, but she's a mainstay trendsetter in the fashion and beauty space to boot. Earlier this year, she turned heads with her trending cowboy copper hair color, and over the weekend, she dropped her new manicure set on Instagram - a fiery Aries-season take on aura nails. ICYMI, aura nails refers to the nail design trend that began in 2021, but has taken off as of late, thanks to both the fun energy they portray, and the easy way you can customize the colors to match your personality and overall vibe. They look just like the spread of color that comes out of an aura photograph, but when they're on a nail design, they don't have to predict your aura. They're more of an energetic aura representation that you can choose for yourself as a sort of manifestation. To recreate aura nails at home or the salon, they require a base color and a bright, opposing color that seeps out from the middle of the nail and bleeds over to the base color. Longer nails work best since you can feature the two colors more prominently. Palmer's aura nails debut were documented on her Instagram as she donned a quintessentially nostalgic Y2K look that included smoky eyeshadow, a graphic tee, and bright red lipstick. After all, her Insta bio does read \"Millennial Diva,\" so if we're going to refer to anyone on how to do early aughts throwbacks, it's going to be Palmer. Although she didn't tag a nail artist in her photo, Palmer has worked with artist Bria Monae in the past, who has tons of aura-inspired nail looks on her page. Palmer's set features a black base color and a fiery red color at the center. And although Aries season is still a few days away (don't come for us, Pisces!), it's a great nod to the fiery, bold energy that the Aries sign represents. What Does a Red Aura Mean? In addition to the nail look being perfect for Aries season, a red aura in general embodies a lot of the traits that Aries represents in the zodiac. According to Healthline, red auras are indicative of being energetic, strong willed, and grounded. As the first sign in the zodiac, Aries are known for being fearless leaders who show others the way by going first. Magic Jewelry, one of New York City's premiere aura photograph locations, notes that if you see a red color in your aura reading photograph, it represents having power, strong leadership skills, and vitality, motivation, and courage, which Palmer certainly checks all the boxes for. Whether your aura reads fiery red or not, getting Palmer's red aura-inspired mani can be a great way to manifest those qualities in yourself and in your interactions with those around you. Take Palmer's nail pic with you to the salon as inspo, or choose your own mix of red, pink, and orange colors.

Get meta with pieces like a baseball cap with the text “No, I’m not selling my hat,” a reference to Gvishiani’s signature hat; a hoodie emblazoned with “This is a hoodie without an idea;” or a T-shirt that says, “Life is a fashion week with some normal days in between.” Prices range from $10.90 to $69.90. Shop now at Zara Zara x Style Not Com T-Shirt, $, available at ZaraPrada Beauty Pradascope Lash Extending Volume Mascara How do you launch a new product in a way that will make a splash?

    "description": "As Black women, we take great pride in our hair and will go to great lengths to make sure we achieve the perfect style — no matter the time or effort it involves. And honestly, we will pay whatever the cost. So it’s not surprising that the global Black haircare market is expected to reach $4.9 billion by 2033, up from $3.2 billion in 2023.  With so much time, money, and energy invested in our hair, finally securing an appointment with the right stylist should feel like a win. And at first, it does. But what happens when that excitement falls short of expectations? What once was a cultural safe haven for women, a place for community and a sanctuary to literally and figuratively let your hair down has become a source of frustration or, worst case scenario, a complete nightmare due to an increase in unprofessional hairstylists. Let’s take a collective deep sigh because we need to talk about it. I know it’s not just me because I have these conversations every other week — at brunch, in coffee shops, or in the group chat about the latest saga of lack of professionalism in Black hair salons. From booking to the final styling, the complete disregard for basic business practices shows up at every step of the process. It wasn’t always like this. So what happened? Now, I pride myself on being a law-abiding Black-hair client. I take the time to read all the terms and conditions before booking an appointment. Through my experiences, I’ve become well-versed in what has seemingly become the industry standard. The average late fee is between $15 and $30 if you arrive up to 15 minutes late to the appointment. Many stylists will understandably require you to reschedule the appointment for anything beyond that, and you will forfeit the security deposit. But professionalism is a two-way street. If there’s a financial penalty for me as a client, there should be one for the stylist. For me, one of the first signs of an unprofessional stylist is the lack of a policy on how they handle running behind schedule. It does not sit right with me that I am required to be on time to avoid a late fee, yet many stylists don’t offer any type of discount on my service when they’re running late. Our hair is more than just aesthetics, it’s a symbol of our individuality, a form of personal self-expression that deserves to be handled with care. Some unprofessional stylists cancel appointments at an unreasonable time. I understand that life happens and things come up. However, if clients are a no-call, no-show, or cancel less than 24 hours before the appointment, stylists will charge at least 50% of the service booked (in addition to the forfeited deposit) with the credit card on file. Yet, there was no one for me to charge for the inconvenience when a Houston stylist canceled my 7:00 a.m. sew-in appointment around 8:43 p.m. the night before. She texted that she did not have the hair I requested but suggested I could still get serviced with my own extensions, with different hair she had available, or I could choose a different service. The stylist not having the hair wasn’t the problem — it’s the fact that the service and hair were available to book in the first place. If she had alerted me earlier in the day, I could have found hair extensions in Houston and, while annoyed, still made the appointment. Why shouldn’t I demand that my service be 50% off when using her rules? This particular stylist has permanently lost me as a customer. I continue to warn my inner circle to avoid her services because God forbid she cancels on my family or friends before their first day of work like she did me. The unprofessionalism plaguing the hair industry is bigger than deposits, cancellations or no-show fees. My sister, who has locs down to her waist, stopped going to her loctician because she frequently took breaks to gossip on the phone in another room.   A growing number of stylists — mainly braiders— now expect clients to arrive with their hair already washed and blow-dried. And if your hair is longer than shoulder length or considered thick, extra charges will likely be added for certain styles, from braids to silk presses. DeAnna Maxwell, who considers herself an “old-school” stylist and founder of Unto Him Hair Salon and Spa in Akron, Ohio, says, “I always teach consumers, whether my client or somebody else’s, to interview your hairdresser the same way you would ask questions to a company during a job interview.” She added, “Find out about the hairstylist policies and processes. They should not service you if you feel uncomfortable.” This reinforces a valid point that client-stylist relationships should be built on mutual trust, respect and understanding. Undeniably, stylists face financial challenges from unreliable clients, leading to many having opted to set up terms, conditions and deposits. As hairstylist and TikTok user hairstylistbusinesscoach states, “I run a business and not a charity. When you book a time slot, that’s a time slot that we couldn’t give somebody else. Y’all gotta realize this is how we take care of our families. This is how we pay our bills.” This highlights the business realities driving these policies. It’s also clear that some hairstylists have probably reached their breaking points with foul clients. Although these are justifiable frustrations it shouldn’t lead or translate into unprofessional conduct across the board.   As a community and for our culture, it’s time to get back to a place where getting our hair done is a positive experience, not a hassle. According to fashion and costume historian Shelby Ivey Christie, one significant reason for unprofessional hairstylists is the lack of experience. “A salon suite does not make a professional stylist,” she said on X, in response to the viral incident involving Jayla Cunningham, a Maryland stylist facing second-degree assault charges for allegedly assaulting a 15-year-old and cutting out her extensions over a payment dispute. Cunningham told local reporters the teen she serviced tried running out of the appointment without paying. However, the teen’s mother says she sent the money to the wrong Cash App user. “Professional is not describing your ability to take payments. Professional is actually alluding to your level of mastery in your skilled work and your years of experience,” Christie continued. Further reiterating that the situation could have been de-escalated with greater experience and professionalism. Maxwell, who has been an entrepreneur for nearly three decades, reinforces this, stressing the importance of mentorship for younger hairstylists beginning their careers in the industry. “Many new hairstylists come out of school with false hope and think that hair school teaches you everything you need to know, but hair school only teaches you how to pass state boards,” she says. “Mentorship will teach professionalism and allow new stylists to retain clientele to thrive in this business.” As more clients continue to speak out in hopes to hold stylists accountable, I hope this moment ignites a reckoning between hairstylists and clients. I hope we can find common ground, where we respect each other’s time, uphold professionalism and reclaim the joy in our haircare experiences.  Otherwise, at least for me, the alternative is investing in a one-on-one class and learning some of these skills myself. Since many of us are already required to come with our hair washed, blow-dried, and stretched out, we’re halfway there in the styling process. Imagine how much money and frustration we could save by bypassing the stylists who show little to no regard for professionalism or our hard-earned coins. At the same time, we can’t ignore the rich legacy we all stand on. The rise of Black women entrepreneurs today is built on the foundation of pioneering women like Madam C.J. Walker, who transformed the haircare industry through mastery, innovation, and service. Both stylists and clients are descendants of this legacy, one shaped by women who took great honor in their craft and reputation. Our hair is more than just aesthetics, it’s a symbol of our individuality, a form of personal self-expression that deserves to be handled with care. When we have a lackluster experience, it doesn’t just waste our time and money. It diminishes the artistry and cultural significance of our crown. As a community and for our culture, it’s time to get back to a place where getting our hair done is a positive experience, not a hassle. A space of community, self-care, comfort and excellence—where professionalism isn’t optional but expected. Like what you see?
