    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/qure-micro-infusion-system-review-49415161",
    "description": "Viral skin-care hacks and products are so plentiful that it's almost impossible to discern which ones are actually worth your time, energy, and money (thank you, TikTok). However, occasionally, a product breaks through the noise and actually lives up to the hype. Case in point: the viral Qure Micro-Infusion System ($99), which yields glowy, even-toned skin and supercharges your entire routine. Celebrity aesthetician Shani Darden swears by Qure's Micro-Infusion System so much that it has become a staple in her personal routine. It's also endorsed by top dermatologists Dr. Dendy Engelman and Dr. Muneeb Shah. As a beauty editor who tries products and treatments for a living, I'm sometimes cautious about at-home treatments that mimic in-office procedures. But since this one has earned the seal of approval from numerous pros, I was game to test it out. Before I get into the specifics of Qure's Micro-Infusion System and what happened when I tried it, it's important to note that needles are involved in this at-home treatment. Contrary to what you may think, it's extremely different from using a derma roller or at-home microneedling, which has earned mixed reviews. While both help skin-care ingredients penetrate deeper and spur collagen production by creating little microtears in the skin, the improper use of derma rollers (rolling needles) can damage skin, while micro-infusion uses a stamping method with sterile, delicate needles. This method prevents skin damage caused by blunt needles and inadequate technique. Even if you've never used an at-home micro-infusion system, there's no need to worry about damaging your skin or doing it incorrectly. With this system, you can safely transform your complexion at home. About the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System Customizable to your skin needs – there's a system to tackle dark spots and uneven skin tone, and another one for fine lines and wrinkles. A safe, at-home microneedling-like product that \"stamps\" your skin with 24K gold 0.5mm needles that are thinner than human hair. Virtually painless and with minimal-to-no downtime. Infuses the skin with active ingredients through microchannels. Helps to boost hydration for a plump and dewy appearance. Reduces the appearance of fine lines, pores, and dark spots. What I Like About the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System Even though it sounds complicated, Qure's Micro-Infusion System is easy to use: The instructions are clear and the system comes with disposable microneedles to ensure your tools are new and sterile with each use. Additionally, in-office microneedling and Aquagold (an in-office micro-infusion treatment) can run you hundreds of dollars a visit, while the Qure Micro-Infusion System is cost-effective and provides comparable results. I like to use the system before bed and love that it takes less than 10 minutes - perfect for a busy schedule, especially if you can't spare the time (let alone the money) to go for an in-office treatment. How to Use the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System The system consists of four easy steps and comes with six serum concentrates and replaceable needle heads. Step one involves filling the chamber of the device (where the serum is housed) with the serum concentrate that will be micro-infused into your skin. For the second step, turn the chamber upside down for one to two minutes to allow the serum to seep into the needles. I advise washing your face at this time so that it's nice and clean. Next, remove the lid from the microneedles and begin infusing the serum into your skin with a stamping motion. Start at the center of your face and work your way around, exhibiting care to cover all areas of your face. Though it's best to start off with one pass, if you feel that your skin can handle it (and if you're gentle enough), you can pass twice over areas that you may have missed or want to treat again. If you choose to use the needles around your eyes, be extra cautious and gentle. Finally, place the lid back on the needle head, twist it off, and dispose of it. You will use a new needle head for your next treatment. If you have any leftover serum, which you probably will, gently pat it on your face and neck and allow it to absorb overnight. Follow with your favorite gentle moisturizer and then clean out the chamber and discard any remaining serum. Darden recommends stamping with 50 percent overlap to ensure that you cover every area of your face. Qure recommends harnessing the treatment every two weeks, with full results shown after three uses. However, I noticed significant results a day or two after a single treatment. As with any skin care, the more consistent you are, the more benefits you'll accrue from the system over time. What to Consider Before Trying the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System It's important to consider if you'll actually be consistent with the treatment in order to see the best results possible. Additionally, since there are needles involved (granted, they are thinner than human hair), there's an element of discomfort with the treatment: It's minimal but still present. When you first start using it, you'll feel a slight pricking feeling as the device goes into your skin. If needles on any level make you feel uncomfortable, micro-infusion may not be for you. You may also experience some slight redness afterward. Steer clear of using the system if your skin is currently irritated or sensitized, and avoid using it on active acne. You also don't want to apply chemical exfoliants or other harsh topical products immediately after using it. Is the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System Worth the Splurge? Qure Skincare's Micro-Infusion System is absolutely worth the splurge, whether you want to maximize your existing skin-care routine or prepare for a special occasion. The results are blatant - my glow after using the treatment speaks for itself. You'll notice hydrated, radiant, and healthy-looking skin. Where Is the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System Available? Qure Skincare's Micro-Infusion System is available at QureSkincare.com.

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find the best things to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.With our Halloween outfits and vampy makeup locked away for another year, our heads are now firmly turning towards the practical parts of our wardrobe that work for all weather eventualities. Think striped sweaters, blanket scarves, and heavy-duty boots. But staying warm doesn’t mean dressing like you’re about to climb a mountain.This season, plenty of It Girls are inspiring our freezing fashion looks for the winter months ahead. For those seeking a chic and refined look, the Olsen twins remain superior thanks to their arsenal of tailored coats, turtlenecks, and classic loafers. If you want a cozier option, Katie Holmes is an ideal reference point for slouchy cardigans, well-fitting jeans, and low-heeled leather boots. A more elevated approach would be Taylor Russell, our inspo for all-out cold-girl glamor with caramel-colored coats, faux fur scarves, and gold statement jewelry. Then there’s makeup, and it’s safe to say that we’re embracing all things warm and glossy. Hailey Bieber is leading the mood board with a pumpkin spice-inspired lip and glowy peach cheeks. And for hair makeovers, we can’t take our eyes off Rihanna’s curls, dyed a very seasonal shade of autumn leaf. To uncover all the new fashion and beauty launches that are giving us even more inspiration this November, click through the slideshow ahead…Tanya Taylor Launches DelphineAcclaimed New York-based designer Tanya Taylor, known for her 10-year-old eponymous label, has debuted a new brand called Delphine. It serves as an alter-ego to Taylor, and is inspired by the glam NYC nightlife aesthetic that cool girls embody — meaning: the elegant woman who’s as likely to be sipping on a martini at Bemelmans Bar as she is sitting on a fire escape in kitten heels. The first Delphine collection is available now, and borrows design cues from vintage red carpets, with peplums, trains, voluminous sleeves, and a palette of rich jewel tones. Find one-shoulder and off-the-shoulder mini dresses, draped midis with square necklines, occasion-worthy gowns, and more. Prices range from $895 to $2,195.Shop now at Delphine  Delphine Cleo Mini, $, available at DelphineDisney x Lululemon Good vibes await courtesy of the new Disney x Lululemon collab, which finds your favorite comfy pieces from the activewear brand adorned with playful Mickey Mouse motifs. The Happily Ever After collection includes Disney-fied versions of the cult-loved Align leggings, an oversized fleece hoodie, a bright pink Energy Longline sports bra, the viral Everywhere Belt Bag, a textured bucket hat with Mickey ears, and so much more. Prices range from $34 to $158.Shop now at LululemonDisney x Lululemon Warm Revelation Beanie, $, available at LululemonDisney x Lululemon Fleece Oversized Hoodie, $, available at LululemonDisney x Lululemon Everywhere Belt Bag 1L Mickey Outline Graphic, $, available at LululemonDisney x Lululemon Align™ High-Rise Pant 25\", $, available at LululemonRhode Barrier ButterIt seems everything Hailey Bieber touches turns to gold, but how about butter? Rhode made its name with hydrating milks and peptide lip balms and now the brand has launched its thickest formula yet in the form of the Barrier Butter. An intensive moisturizer, the balm-like formula provides deep hydration for plump and glowing skin. Containing hyaluronic and polyglutamic acid, the buttery nighttime cream is all about locking in moisture and improving barrier function — perfect for chapped winter skin.Shop now at RhodeRhode Barrier Butter, $, available at RhodeCarolina Herrera x FrameThe new collaboration between Carolina Herrera and Frame started with a simple question: What would the chic women who gravitate toward the fashion house wear when they’re not wearing its gowns? The answer: feminine, tailored denim that plays with proportions and color. The resulting capsule — Carolina Herrera’s first denim collection — debuted on the brand’s Resort 2025 runway show in Mexico City earlier this month, and includes pieces such as a voluminous denim maxi skirt, tapered jeans, and cropped jackets in red, white, yellow, and baby blue. Prices range from $498 to $1,198.Shop now at Frame and Carolina Herrera  Carolina Herrera x Frame The Tailored Denim Jacket, $, available at FrameCarolina Herrera x Frame The Denim Ball Skirt, $, available at FrameLarroudé’s Non-Black Friday Black Friday SaleIt’s the season of Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales — this year, though, Larroudé is doing something different: Instead of offering discounts on existing inventory, the fashion-crowd-favorite footwear label is giving early access to its Spring/Summer 2025 collection at 30% off starting on November 21. This offers fans an opportunity to shop the collection early, while the brand gets an idea of how many of each style it needs to produce based, helping limit waste. Shop now at Larroudé Larroudé Dew Drop Mule, $, available at LarroudéFree People x Yellowstone With the Western trend still going strong, it only makes sense that Free People has partnered with the hit TV show Yellowstone for a limited-edition collection. The eight-piece We The Free capsule is full of Americana staples, including cowboy boots, bandanas, a cowboy hat, bootcut jeans, a suede jacket, and a graphic “Dutton Ranch” T-shirt with horses on it. Naturally, the campaign stars Yellowstone’s Kelsey Asbille and was shot on Dutton Ranch in Montana, where the Paramount+ series is filmed. The Free People x Yellowstone collection is available now, with prices ranging from $58 to $498.Shop now at Free PeopleFree People x Yellowstone Dutton Tee, $, available at Free PeopleFree People x Yellowstone Birch Belt, $, available at Free PeopleFree People x Yellowstone Flora Low-Rise Bootcut Jeans, $, available at Free PeopleFree People x Yellowstone Allistar Pointed Boots, $, available at Free PeopleMerit Retrospect Extrait de ParfumMerit is well loved for its beautifully crafted makeup products and now the brand is expanding into the fragrance space with a vanilla and crisp pear perfume. Encased in a sculptural gold-topped bottle, the debut perfume has top notes of bergamot, heart notes of rosemary and jasmine, and base notes of moss and musk. Formulated as a highly concentrated extrait de parfum (with almost 30% fragrance oil), the scent promises a long wear of over 12 hours.Shop now at Merit BeautyMerit Retrospect L’Extrait de Parfum, $, available at MeritMadewell and LESET Team Up For a Cozy \u0026 Chic Capsule CollectionMadewell and LA label Leset, known for its minimalist loungewear, have teamed up for a cozy collab just in time for holiday gift shopping and giving.

For the collection, the Noah team dug into Barbour’s archives and reimagined popular styles from the ’80s. There’s the unisex Wool Bedale Jacket, which features a corduroy collar and is made with Casentino wool (a fuzzy fabric dating back to the 14th century); the Cotton Bedale, with the same silhouette but in a salt-washed cotton canvas; and the Border Jacket, a longer tweed style. “For this season’s Barbour collection, we stuck to the classic jacket shapes we’ve always loved from them,” Noah founder Brendon Babenzien said in a press release. “Barbour jackets, more than any other, have a timeless quality that allows them to get passed down from one generation to the next.” The Noah x Barbour collab is available to shop now.Shop now at Noah and BarbourNoah x Barbour Wool Teddy Bedale Jacket, $, available at NoahRixo Launches HomewareKnown for its retro aesthetic and vintage-inspired prints, fashion brand Rixo is taking the next step in its stylistic journey with the launch of its homeware range, Casa Rixo. Featuring abstract printed tablecloths, cushions, and napkins, the collection is available in two distinct colorways: a warm, Mediterranean-inspired terracotta and a blue-hued design with olive and peach accents. Made from linen and cotton blends, the statement homeware is R29 dinner party-approved.Shop now at RixoRIXO Zebe Linen and Cotton-Blend Tablecloth, $, available at RixoRouje x MissomaIn a romantic collaboration of Paris and London design, the new Rouje x Missoma jewelry collection is a color-lover’s dream. Our favorite looks in the capsule include a pair of ‘80s-inspired, oversized mosaic studs combining semi-precious blue, red, and green quartz with 18-carat recycled gold plating. The playful designs continue with a molten heart necklace featuring three gemstones on a velvet black choker. If you prefer to keep things classic, the collab includes a chunky gold domed ring with ridged detailing and matching vintage-inspired hoops.Shop now at MissomaRouje x Missoma Marisa Heart Pearl Stud Earrings, $, available at MissomaHuda Beauty Icy Nude CollectionWith icy days on the horizon, we’ve got nothing but love for Huda Beauty’s latest frosty collection of cool-toned colors. Announced as the brand’s last foray into big eyeshadow palettes, the shades include a mix of mauve alongside a gunmetal glitter, pink shimmer and a snow-white matte. Branching beyond palettes, the collection also includes three new Faux Filter lipglosses (including an icy iridescent clear) and a ‘frostbitten’ face gloss that changes color with the pH of the skin. If frosty hues aren’t your thing, you can warm up with two new Blush Filters in deep Coco Loco and Latte.Shop now at Huda Beauty Huda Beauty Icy Nude Eyeshadow Palette, $, available at Huda BeautyHaider Ackermann Releases First Canada Goose CollectionAfter being announced as the first creative director of Canada Goose earlier this year, designer Haider Ackermann has just dropped his first collection with the outerwear brand with a campaign starring actor Ethan Hawke. Called “Snow Goose,” the capsule is inspired by the outdoors — the type of environment best suited for the brand's outerwear. “Being surrounded by nature allows one to be connected with oneself — it reflects, it inspires, it provokes. It is in this rhythm and energy that we designed this capsule,” Ackermann said in a press release. The collection includes new spins on the brand’s archival pieces, such as the Rider Parker, a utilitarian slouchy jacket inspired by the ’90s-era Peacekeeper Parka, as well as apparel, like an oversized graphic sweater and a thin, layerable turtleneck. Moving forward, Ackermann will drop seasonal collections twice a year under the Snow Goose name, which was the brand's heritage label back in the ’90s. Shop now at Canada Goose Canada Goose Rider Parka, $, available at Canada GooseMarc Jacobs x Wizard of OzThe arrival of Wicked on the big screen has us all reaching for emerald green attire or a fluffy pink ballgown, but Marc Jacobs is offering something a tad more sophisticated to coincide with the film’s release. Taking inspiration from the original Wizard of Oz, the collection includes totes, handbags and wallets with stills from the iconic movie, including imagery of the famed yellow brick road. For the biggest Dorothy fans around, the main event is a pair of diamanté-encrusted, crimson Mary Janes with a vertigo-inducing platform heel that makes the original ruby slippers look like running shoes.Shop now at Marc JacobsMarc Jacobs x The Wizard of Oz The Friends of Dorothy Leather Mini Compact Wallet, $, available at Marc JacobsLike what you see?
