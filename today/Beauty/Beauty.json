    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-uv-filters-spf-45-sunscreen?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Something’s been brewing at The Ordinary — and I’m not talking about the brand’s excellent GF 15% Solution, which has replaced my Botox obsession, or even the new Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum, which outperforms every vitamin C in my routine. The real news is a product we’ve all been patiently waiting for, and it’s one that no skincare routine is complete without. Enter The Ordinary’s new sunscreen: UV Filters SPF 45 Serum, $19. Longtime fans of The Ordinary will know this isn’t the brand’s first attempt at sunscreen. Some may remember the Mineral UV Filters SPF 30 with Antioxidants, packaged in its signature silver tube. But the thick texture and white cast, typical of many mineral formulas, left much to be desired. True to form, The Ordinary listened to customer feedback and discontinued the product, returning to the drawing board.  It took a few years to get right, but The Ordinary doesn’t do things by halves — and today, the new UV Filters SPF 45 Serum, $19, is finally here. Luckily, I was one of the first beauty directors to try a sample — and trust me, you’ll actually want to wear this one every day. The Ordinary UV Filters SPF 45 Serum, $19 Is The Ordinary’s new SPF mineral or chemical? Whether you’re a sunscreen devotee or only remember to apply it occasionally, the question on everyone’s lips is whether the new SPF is anything like its predecessor. Unlike the Mineral UV Filters, this formula is much thinner in texture. While The Ordinary calls it a “serum”, it’s more like a lightweight lotion — easy to apply and absorbed in moments, with no excessive rubbing or blotting required. The lighter texture is down to the type of UV filters used. The Ordinary has shelved its original mineral filters, opting instead for “chemical” filters — approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Chemical filters absorb harmful UV rays and convert them into less damaging heat that is then released from the skin before it can cause any adverse effects, like sunburn and eventually sun damage.   You’re probably wondering why the brand decided to pivot from its original mineral filters. In a press release, The Ordinary explained that it’s “harder to formulate a truly transparent, lightweight and accessibly priced sunscreen with mineral filters alone.” Using chemical filters, for example, octocrylene and homosalate, means that the product doesn’t leave behind the same white cast as the original. Even better, it’s a dream to apply (more on that later) and affordable at $19. Is there a difference between SPF 45 and SPF 50? The Ordinary’s UV Filters SPF 45 is a broad-spectrum sunscreen, meaning it protects your skin from both UVA (which can cause skin cancer and premature aging) and UVB (responsible for sunburn and skin cancer). Most sunscreens have an SPF (sun protection factor) of 30 or 50, which indicates how well they protect against UVB. For example, if you burn after 10 minutes in the sun without sunscreen, SPF 30 lets you stay in the sun about 30 times longer, assuming you’ve applied enough. So why did the brand settle on SPF 45 specifically?  “Contrary to popular belief, the UV filter number is not decided by the brand that formulates the sun-protectant but rather by the formula itself,” says the brand, adding, “When The Ordinary’s product underwent testing, the SPF value that it achieved was SPF 45, which is estimated to absorb only 0.2% less UVB radiation than SPF 50.” The difference between SPF 45 and 50 is only about 1%, so the most important thing is that you’re applying enough. Most dermatologists recommend two finger lengths’ worth of sunscreen for your face and neck.  Is The Ordinary’s SPF 45 any good? I apply sunscreen every morning, whether I’m leaving the house or not, so it’s fair to say that I have high expectations. Besides being broad-spectrum (UVA can pass through glass, and I work by a large window), my sunscreen has to work with, not against, my combination skin. I want it to be moisturising enough for my dry cheeks but not greasy, so it doesn’t exacerbate my oily T-zone. Happily, this one is just right. The texture is light yet hydrating, giving my skin a juicy, dewy finish similar to some Korean sunscreens I’ve tried — but at a fraction of the price. Even when I apply two finger lengths’ worth, it doesn’t feel like a chore. It absorbs quickly without feeling uncomfortable or sticky, nor does it sting my eyes. Even better, it’s non-comedogenic, which means it’s less likely to clog pores and cause zits. Most skincare breaks me out, but I’ve been using this for weeks without any issues whatsoever.  The Ordinary also claims it’s suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin. I actually gave away the mineral sunscreen I was using before because it made my delicate eyelids burn. Thankfully, UV Filters SPF 45 is gentle on my reactive skin; I don’t feel a thing.  While sun protection is the main goal, I love that it makes an excellent anchor for makeup. My foundation and concealer blend seamlessly over the top, and with my skin perfectly quenched, I’m convinced that the final result looks more flawless than before. I attribute this to the ultra-moisturising glycerin and phospholipids, which keep moisture under lock and key, and maintain the skin’s barrier.  A dermatologist once told me that the best sunscreen is the one you want to wear every day. For me, it has to be UV Filters SPF 45, and since it’s cheaper than the others in my bathroom currently, I can stock up.  The Ordinary’s UV Filters SPF 45, $19, is available at theordinary.com This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/maybelline-face-the-difference-campaign?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "I remember the first time I went shopping for concealer at the drugstore. I was probably 14, and was so excited to start trying makeup looks inspired by my favorite YouTube beauty gurus. I’m mixed-race Japanese-American, with olive skin that usually falls into the light-medium range. I looked at the darker shade options of a popular mass brand’s concealer, already bummed that the overwhelmingly peachy, cooler undertones made my olive skin look grey. I left the store with a serviceable option, but didn’t feel great about it.  In 2025, Maybelline is making sure no one has that experience again — and for Global Brand President of Maybelline New York Trisha Ayyagari, it’s a mission that hits home. “Growing up, I’ve always loved beauty,” she tells Refinery29. “I will never forget how I was unable to find a shade that matched my skin and how disappointing that was.” To celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, Maybelline (in partnership with Bustle Digital Group and Gold House) has unveiled a history-making campaign called Face the Difference, spotlighting its bestselling Fit Me foundation (which comes in 40 shades and has a 97% match success rate).  “From the start, the notion of Fit Me was to make people feel represented both in the shades and the products, but also in all of the campaigns and activations that we do,” Ayyagari says. Featuring 40 AAPIH creatives, athletes, business owners, and more, Face The Difference is spotlighting the diversity that exists in the Asian community. The impressive cast of Maybelline’s campaign includes Jenn Tran, the first-ever Asian-American Bachelorette, Jing Gao, founder and CEO of the popular (and delicious) Fly By Jing, Olympic figure skater Maia Shibutani, content creator Cynthia Victor, and Svetha Nallapaneni, professional dancer and Radio City Rockette.  “Maybelline has long championed the idea that beauty is for everyone,” said Alex Wang, Brand Marketing Director of Maybelline, who helped bring the campaign to life. “This campaign is a powerful extension of that legacy, celebrating the strength and richness of the Asian Pacific community through a modern, comprehensive lens with our wonderful partners at Bustle Digital Group and Gold House.” Teaming up with Gold House, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to amplifying and investing in Asian Pacific leadership and voices, Maybelline is making sure this initiative is much more than just another beauty campaign with pretty faces. In addition to the cast of talent, Maybelline enlisted a team of creatives (including makeup artists, hairstylists, photographers, and more) to ensure representation behind-the-scenes in addition to in front of the camera. “It was just an incredible day to celebrate our heritage,” says Ayyagari of bringing the campaign to life on set. “It’s not just the products matching, but it’s also being able to see yourself represented,” she says. “Confidence is often based on being able to identify with other people. And so ensuring that our campaigns represent as many different skin tones, backgrounds, genders as possible has been a big priority of mine, and is truly aligned with the values of the brand.” Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/button-nails-trend-49441468",
    "description": "Image Source: Taylor Hill/Getty Images Despite the fact that most 2025 Met Gala attendees decided to go the less-is-more route with their nails (save for some french manicures with a twist), a few stars celebrated the \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" theme through to their fingers. SNL's Ego Nwodim was one of them, with her unique but eye-catching button nails. The comedian, who was one of the red carpet hosts for the night, made her Met Gala debut in a Christopher John Rogers three-piece suit. The pristine tailoring was on full display, as the back of the suit featured a peplum-ruffled detail that brought the jacket to life. Her manicure pulled directly from the outfit itself, mirroring the eight rainbow fasteners on each of Nwodim's sleeves with the 3D buttons on her fingers. Believe it or not, this isn't the first time that buttons made their way onto a celebrity's nails. Pulling inspiration from fashion is quite common in the world of nails. Earlier this year, \"denim manicures\" began trending, with nail art made to mimic the look of the popular jean fabric. In April 2025, Doechii wore button nails that spun to a performance in California. This begs the question: are buttons this summer's hottest nail trend? Image Source: Michael Buckner/Penske Media via Getty Images If we have anything to say about it, the answer is yes. According to celebrity manicurist Betina Goldstein, who did Nwodim's manicure for the Met Gala, real buttons were glued directly onto each extension for this look. If that doesn't scream DIY nail party, we don't know what does. If you want to try it for yourself, we have the breakdown of exactly how Goldstein used, ahead.\"Christopher John Rodgers is known for his vibrant prints and colorful buttons, so I wanted Ego's nails to be an extension of her incredible peplum suit,\" Goldstein says in a press release. \"I really wanted to bring in this element of work and for it to pop.\" The base color is the CND Shellac Polish in Black Pool ($17) with the No-Wipe+ Top Coat ($17). To make the buttons stay secured all night, Goldstein sealed them in place with the CND Plexigel Builder ($27). Of course, if you're recreating a gel look at home, you'll need a gel curing light. Goldstein used the CND LED Lamp ($192). If you want a shortcut to this look without having to buy all the supplies, Goldstein recommends using stickers instead of actual buttons, but if you have a trusted nail tech up for the challenge, trying out this look will put you ahead of the curve for summer nail art. Maybe just BYOB (bring your own buttons) to the salon.",

    "description": "Welcome to Show the Receipts, a new series where we ask interesting people to share exactly how much it costs to get shit done. No matter the task, we're tracking every last dollar from start to finish. Up next: a Met Gala manicure. Julie Kandalec is one of New York City's top manicurists. With celebrity clients like Emily Blunt, Jessica Chastain, and Viola Davis, she's on the award-show circuit and regularly on call for fashion's biggest night of the year: the 2025 Met Gala. At this year's Met Gala, themed \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\" Kandalec was hired by a brand-new client: Isha Ambani, an Indian business leader from Mumbai. They were connected over Instagram in the days leading up to the Met Gala. \"Her team reached out to me directly on Instagram, proving that social media works,\" says Kandalec. The bespoke nail-design process followed shortly thereafter. \"Not including prepping or packing my kit, I spent about eight hours swatching colors and going over designs with Isha's creative team,\" Kandalec says. They landed on a gorgeous nude manicure with graphic black accents, which ended up being perfectly on-theme with the french manicures with a twist that were all over the red carpet. Here, Kandalec breaks down everything she packed in her Met Gala nail kit - and the associated costs. Keep reading to be shocked. Here's the full breakdown. Task: Met Gala manicure Occupation: Celebrity nail artist Location: New York, New York Timeline: Approximately three days of event prep (although this kit has been developed through Kandalec's many years of experience; it's not a starter pack) The Receipts The kit: $1,403 for a rolling suitcase, a backpack, and a stool to sit on Basics: $488 for toe separators, gel removal foils, acetone, buffers, towels, gloves, and one-time use files Nail tools: $720 for an e-file, e-file bits, diamond nail files, nippers, and nail clipper Skin care: $1,236 for lotions, hand oils, and cuticle oils Nail art supplies: $1,949 for nail art brushes, gems, crystals, and a palette Tech: $573 for an LED lamp, dust collector, light to see, and extension cord Nail polish: $3,348 for 150 gel polishes and between 75-100 of regular polish Enhancements: $638 for builder gels, prep products, lap table for gel lamp, and gel brushes Pedicure tools: $371 pedi bowl, pedi files, and scrubs Ubers: $333 Total Cost: $11,059 How I Did It A seasoned pro, Kandalec has been developing her kit for years and regularly restocks on her essentials. To prep for the 2025 Met Gala, she began shopping three days before the big night. PS: What does the day of the Met Gala look like for you? JK: The day of, we had a later call time of 2 pm, so I blew out my hair and packed my kit in the morning. My light, e-file, and dust collector need to be charged. I make sure my towels are washed. Plus, of course, I disinfect my tools and triple-check that I have everything I need. Nails are so highly chemistry-based that leaving one thing at home will throw off the whole service - and you don't have time to run to the store. This year, it was raining - plus they moved the call time up 30 minutes - so getting there on time was going to be close. But I made it right on time with hair and makeup. We set up in the hotel suite and began glam. I always start with a pedicure, so they have more time to dry before putting on shoes. After glam is done, it's time to get dressed and see the whole look put together. I was able to snag a BTS pic of her nails and jewelry. Then I rush home to watch the rest of the red carpet and see the rest of the looks, and of course, share the team's work on socials. PS: What is the most surprising expense incurred during the Met Gala manicure process? JK: Uber messengers. I am friends with many nail artists, and they know I have a gigantic arsenal: floor-to-ceiling cabinets plus an entire bedroom and my atelier. I'm happy to messenger supplies to anyone who forgot something in L.A. PS: Where do you cut costs and budget for a big event manicure like the Met Gala? JK: I'm not much of a cost-cutter, especially during awards season and Met. It's a huge event, and I want to be prepared and feel confident. I might do the opposite and splurge on a nice massage after, like I plan on doing in Bali this weekend, on a cliffside massage at Alila Villas in Uluwatu. PS: What is an expense that is absolutely worth the splurge when it comes to a Met Gala manicure? JK: My kit has gotten so heavy - 70 pounds, sometimes more - and lifting it in and out of Ubers and up stairs became so difficult that I needed to split the weight. Rolling around two suitcases is cumbersome and takes up too much space in tiny NYC hotel rooms. I had a gift card to TUMI and spotted this backpack ($750). It opens like a suitcase but looks like a backpack. I put most of my polish in here and carry it on my back now, or I can slide it over the handle of my suitcase and roll it. It's a huge splurge, but worth it to not have to lift a 70-pound suitcase anymore. PS: Any tips for a beginner nail artist building a kit for an event like the Met Gala and trying to stay on a budget? JK: Art gels - they're extra pigmented and come in a pot vs. a bottle - are amazing because you can mix so many colors without having to carry around a ton of bottles. Mia Secret ($9) makes nice ones. They're a staple in my kit. Final Thoughts Kandalec admits to being a \"maximalist\" when it comes to her nail kit. But it's a compilation of years of work experience, global travel, and personal curation. \"I just got back from Tokyo and brought back a ton of new gel colors and gems,\" she says. \"I just like to have options. So please don't look at the number and think that's what you must spend. This is a result of years of curating my kit.\" Related: \"Dollop\" Bangs Are the Celebrity-Loved Trend Taking Over Award Season Megan Decker is a freelance writer and editor based in New York City.
