    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kate-hudson-hair-routine-interview?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "To be in a room with Kate Hudson is to be filled with energy. Walking into our interview, I catch the tail end of a conversation she’s having about moon and rising signs (Hudson is a prototypical Aries). Repositioning herself on the white cloud sectional at the Baccarat Hotel in New York City, Hudson effortlessly bounces the conversation to basketball. Her new Netflix series, Running Point, streams on the flatscreen on the wall in front of us. “Oh, I love this scene,” she says gesturing to the TV. Even without sound, Hudson’s presence is magnetic—her white power suit, high heels, and signature blonde waves commanding the screen. Hudson, being a native Angeleno, felt equipped to take on the role of Isla (a character inspired by the president of the L.A. Lakers, Jeanie Buss). “When you grow up in L.A., you have to know about basketball and the Los Angeles Lakers,” she explains. “Also, my best friend from high school [Baron Davis] became a professional basketball player, so my whole life was going to his games.”  Of course, if you’ve seen the first few episodes, you know that Running Point is focused on the family-business side of the NBA (Succession-coded), which was new territory for Hudson. “I’m not a big follower of trading — like, who is going where — but when we started doing the show, that started to change,” she adds. “But also, the show is really about the family, their dysfunctional hilarity.” While I can’t wait to stream the entire Running Point series, I want to discuss her iconic hair. It’s just been announced that Hudson is the Global Celebrity Spokesperson for Joico, heading their new campaign, Find Your Joi. Ahead, Hudson speaks to Refinery29 about her love for extensions, hair maintenance, and how she finds joy. The following interview was edited for length and clarity. R29: Your hair is so long and blonde in this show, are you wearing extensions?Kate Hudson: Yes, I love extensions. My hair is super healthy but it’s probably there [gestures to shoulder]. I just change it with extensions when I want to or need to. R29: How would you describe your hair type? KH: I’ve had hair that was unruly and defiant my whole life so I’ve just learned to go with it. I either have to defuse my hair to make it curly, or blow it out to make it straight. Thank God for these [Joico] products, but it’s a lot of buns in my life. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kate Hudson (@katehudson) R29: What does wash-day look like to you? How often are you washing your hair and what are you using to style it? KH: I used to go four or five days and not wash my hair. But then I just [filmed] this movie where I had to wash my hair every day and my hair got so healthy. In the movie, I chose to use no extensions, nothing, it’s just my own hair. We used hot rollers and spray, and then I’d go home and wash my hair every night — and this was for like three months — and my hair got very healthy. I think it needs to be washed. For some reason, if I’m not washing my hair, it starts to break. I love the Defy Damage shampoo and conditioner. The mask is also good for anyone who colors their hair, which I do once a week. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kate Hudson (@katehudson) R29: What does a good hair day look like for you? KH: I strongly believe that when your hair looks good, it really does change the way you feel about everything. A good hair day is much more important than a good makeup day. But it’s hit or miss for me. If I have to do my hair myself and it didn’t dry nicely, I’m going to put it in a bun. If it’s really not great, I’ll do a slick thing: I’ll take something like this oil, that’s kind of weighted and moisturizes your hair. I usually do a ballerina-type of bun. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kate Hudson (@katehudson) R29: What do you use for your buns? Do you use a claw clip or scrunchie? KH: I like the big wig pins; they look like bobby pina. I just take my hair, twist it up, and pin it with that. Then I like my big silk scrunchies, and I have a ton of those clips that keep my bangs out of my face. R29: What do you ask for when you’re getting your hair colored? KH: I like a warmer blonde. I started going to Tracey [Cunningham] and she’s given me the most amazing warm blonde. I have so much red in my hair. My natural colors are a dirty red blonde. I have a lot of copper. Actually, we’re all red in my family. My grandma on my dad’s side, redhead. My grandma on my mom’s mom, redhead. My aunt, redhead. All my brother’s beards, red. [My soon] Ryder came out looking like Conan O’Brien, but then he went to caramel. But yeah all my brothers’ beards are red. R29: What about your hair cut? KH: Right now, my curtain bangs are grown out. But usually I like a little curtain bang, like a little wispy bang.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kate Hudson (@katehudson) R29: Because this campaign is about Finding Your Joi, what is something that has brought you joy recently? KH: My kids always bring me so much joy. It’s been a tough time. We live in the Palisades. It’s been one of those life-altering experiences for all of my children. We were lucky that our house survived. But it’s really something when you go through that type of traumatic experience with your community. I think the thing that has brought me the most joy in this moment that’s been challenging: seeing how strong communities can be when things are so profoundly sad. You find strength in each other. And being with the people from my show recently. This whole show experience. They all bring me joy: Mindy [Kaling], Ike [Barinholtz], Dave [Stassen], all my show bros.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/award-show-hairstylist-costs-receipts-49431657",
    "description": "Welcome to Show the Receipts, a series where we ask industry insiders to break down exactly how much it costs to get things done. From start to finish, we track every last dollar. Up next: what it takes to get a celebrity's hair Oscars-ready. Hollywood's biggest night means we all become beauty critics ready to judge A-listers' looks from our sweats in the comfort of our living rooms. When our favorite celebrity hits the Oscars red carpet with perfectly coiffed waves or a slicked-back bun, it's easy to assume their look came together effortlessly. Still, behind the scenes, teams of stylists prep for this occasion months in advance and budget for it even longer. For celebrity hairstylist Jerrod Roberts, who styled Hannah Einbinder for the \"Vanity Fair\" Oscars After Party, the prep is anything but effortless. \"Oscars bookings happen at least a month in advance. . . people don't always realize how much goes into styling hair for the Oscars,\" says Roberts. \"From the tools to the extensions, the costs add up fast.\" Some of the biggest hidden expenses include specialized hair pins and bungees only available in Paris and an extensive collection of high-end irons, brushes, and rollers. For an event like the Oscars, restocking hero products and acquiring any necessary hairpieces is essential. \"I always update my kit before awards season,\" Roberts says. \"Whether it's new products, extra extensions, or custom accessories, I like to be prepared for anything.\" Sometimes, beauty brands send him products to test on clients, but many of the high-quality tools he uses - like Mason Pearson brushes and specialized round brushes - are personal investments. Surprises are inevitable when working an event as high-profile as the Oscars. \"One time, a client decided last-minute that they wanted a short-hair moment but couldn't actually cut their hair for a project,\" Roberts says. \"I had to buy a wig for over $700 and style it the night before.\" Costs add up quickly, from restocking high-end products to investing in custom hairpieces, here's what it really takes - and costs - to create a picture-perfect Oscars look. Here's the full cost breakdown. Task: Styling Hair for the Oscars Job: Celebrity hairstylist Location: Los Angeles, CA Timeline: 1 month The Receipts Styling Fees \u0026 Essentials: $1,000 - $3,000 per client Hair Extensions \u0026 Accessories: $800 - $2,000 Specialized Tools \u0026 Maintenance: $6,125 (tools, french pins, full kit upkeep) Restocking \u0026 Custom Pieces: $1,350 - $2,150 (products, fake fringes, ponytails, custom wig) Brushes \u0026 Basics: $350 (Mason Pearson brush + round brush) Total Estimated Cost: $9,625 - $13,625 (varies by client/event needs) How I Did It PS: Can you walk us through the total cost of doing hair for a celebrity at the Oscars? From travel to products, what goes into it? Jerrod Roberts: For certain red carpet events, the cost can range from $1,000 to $3,000. If I need to buy extensions ($600-$1,000) or hair accessories ($200-$1,000), I usually cover those expenses myself. I'm fortunate to now live in LA, but when I was based in NYC, I had to purchase my plane tickets and pay for my hotel when coming out for the Oscars. PS: What are some of the biggest expenses that people might not realize come with styling an A-lister for a major event like the Oscars? JR: The biggest expenses are tools, pins, and hair extensions. I have a collection of irons, ranging from very small to very large, which cost hundreds of dollars ($800). I also use specialized hair pins and bungees that can only be found in France, so I restock every time I'm in Paris. My full hair kit, which includes extensions and ponytails in every shade from blond to black, costs upwards of $5,000 - plus priceless sets of hot rollers I've collected over the years that are no longer made. PS: What's an expense that is absolutely worth the splurge when prepping for an award show? JR: Brushes. I only use boar bristle hairbrushes, and my Mason Pearson brush costs $250. Each of my round brushes is priced between $75 and $100. PS: How do you financially prepare for the Oscars? Is it something you budget for months in advance? JR: I plan for the money going into awards season before it happens. At this point in my career, I feel like I've got most of what I need for an awards season, but I always plan on buying extra hair or accessories for clients. PS: What budgeting advice would you give aspiring hairstylists wanting to break into styling celebrities for the Oscars? JR: Learn to save your money and build your kit up over time. The nature of working as a celebrity hairdresser is that your money is always in flux. I've learned to save my money when I get paid for bigger jobs and keep it for when I need it for slower periods or unexpected expenses. I started building my kit when I was an assistant. I would buy a few things here and there, and eventually, I had a decent styling kit. As I became more successful, I started to upgrade the various parts of my kit, like my brushes, or add to my iron collection. Also, don't put all your eggs in one basket. Try to diversify the way you make your money. Whether social media, cutting hair in a salon, or working with product brands/education, having more than one way to get income will save you. The last five years hit the celebrity hairdresser industry hard. We had COVID and back-to-back strikes, which halted productions and red-carpet events, and many of us were forced to find other ways to keep the money coming in. Final Thoughts From custom wigs to top-tier tools, the price of creating a flawless Oscars look is anything but small. But in an industry where reputation is everything, the investment isn't just about one night - it's about staying at the top of the game. Styling a celebrity for the Oscars is as much an investment as it is an art. The costs add up quickly, but there's no cutting corners in an industry where every detail matters. For many stylists, the payoff isn't just in the paycheck - it's in seeing their work on one of the most-watched red carpets in the world. And when the cameras flash and the look goes viral, the expense feels like just another part of the job.

    "description": "Unless there's a special occasion, I don't usually reach for a full-coverage foundation. More often than not, I finish off my skin-care routine with a tinted SPF, cover any noticeable breakouts with some concealer, and call it a day. But recently, I've been dealing with lingering dark spots and redness - on top of the dryness that I've come to expect each winter. On the hunt for something that evens out my skin tone and brightens my complexion, I picked up the new Make Up For Ever Super Boost Skin Tint ($36). What stood out to me about the Super Boost Skin Tint is that it's a makeup product with skin-care benefits. The product is said to provide light-to-medium coverage - which definitely appealed to me, since I like to keep my makeup as lightweight as possible. But it doesn't hurt that the hydrating and plumping skin tint also has ingredients that can help improve the texture and appearance of your complexion right away (and over time). With all that in mind, I decided to put the skin tint to the test and see if it actually makes my skin look better immediately after application. Keep reading for my honest thoughts on the Make Up Forever Super Boost Skin Tint ahead. About the Make Up For Ever Super Boost Skin Tint According to the brand, the product is a lightweight, moisturizing skin tint with \"buildable, sheer to medium coverage\" that gives skin a long-lasting boost. The Super Boost Skin Tint's unique push-to-dispense tube offers customizable coverage with more control. It's formulated with hydrating and plumping ingredients like polyglutamic and hyaluronic acids, plus grapefruit extract that can help with skin texture and hyperpigmentation. The skin tint is available in 18 different shades. What I Like About the Make Up For Ever Super Boost Skin Tint One thing I noticed when I first used the skin tint was how unique the packaging was. The Super Boost Skin Tint is dispensed in a tube that looks like a syringe, so if you press lightly on the end, only a small amount comes out. If you press the button down with more force, you end up with more product. My biggest pet peeve is wasting product, which happens often with foundations that don't have a pump, so I love the level of control I have while using this. When it was finally time to apply the tint, it immediately melted into my skin and blended in seamlessly. It had a gel-like texture and barely-there feel. Admittedly, one layer of product felt too sheer on me but still managed to give my skin a more even look and lessen the appearance of dark spots and redness. I don't like covering my freckles, so I appreciated that they were still visible under the tint as well. For more coverage, I could add on another layer, but more often than not I found that one was enough to achieve that \"no makeup\" makeup look. When it comes to wear time, I found that this holds up pretty well on its own and lasts throughout the day. But I prefer to maximize the product's wear time by using it with a light finishing powder. (I use Glossier Wowder, which isn't heavy duty, so it's truly a testament to the tint's staying power.) The skin tint has a radiant finish that leaves skin looking fresh and glowy, but never oily. How to Use the Make Up For Ever Super Boost Skin Tint For sheer coverage, press down on the end of the tube once. For more coverage, press until you get the desired amount. The brand recommends using your fingers to apply the product to your face and neck. You can use a sponge, but I found that the fingers work better as the sponge soaks up more of the product than I'd like. What to Consider Before Trying the Make Up For Ever Super Boost Skin Tint The Super Boost Skin Tint is definitely on the lighter side when it comes to coverage, so if you prefer a full-coverage foundation, this probably won't be the best fit for you. Who the Make Up For Ever Super Boost Skin Tint Is Best For This skin tint is perfect for anyone who wants more coverage than, say, a tinted moisturizer or SPF, but not as much as a typical foundation. If you're also someone who likes seeing skin-loving ingredients in your makeup, the Super Boost Skin Tint may be right up your alley. Where Is the Make Up For Ever Super Boost Skin Tint Available? The Make Up For Ever Super Boost Skin Tint is available for purchase at Sephora and Make Up For Ever.
