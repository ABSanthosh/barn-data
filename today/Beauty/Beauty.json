If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. I don’t pretend to be particularly gifted at styling my own hair, so I’m constantly on the hunt for an all-in-one tool that is easy to use and achieves the result I’m looking for: smooth, soft waves with body and movement. Prior to releasing the FlexStyle, Shark was perhaps best known for vacuums and Shark Ninja kitchen gadgets. But now that the multi-functional hair tool (which is widely viewed as the biggest rival to the Dyson Airwrap) has amassed a legion of loyal fans, the brand is uniquely positioned to make some waves (literally) as it continues to build out its hair tool assortment.  It’s time to see if lightning can strike twice for Shark with its eagerly-awaited sophomore launch, the FlexFusion. The bar was set high, but if anyone can rise to the challenge, it’s Shark. Keep reading for our full review of the highly-anticipated new beauty tool. What’s new about the FlexFusion? We’ll get right into it: The biggest thing that sets the new FlexFusion from the beloved FlexStyle is that it’s a true wet-to-dry styler that takes your hair from post-shower to bouncy blowout (with the help of a few attachments, of course). Additionally, the new tool is more powerful, yet more compact and lighter than the FlexStyle, making it more travel-friendly (and easy on your muscles) than other stylers on the market. Shark FlexFusion Air \u0026 Ceramic System with Air Straightener, $399.99 What’s in the box? There are a couple versions of the tool to choose from, depending on your hair type and texture:  First, there’s the Wet-or-Dry FlexFusion Air \u0026 Ceramic System with Air Straightener, which comes with a flatiron-inspired attachment head to dry and smooth hair in a matter of passes. (For reference, it’s comparable to the Dyson Airstrait.) Next, there’s the Wet-or-Dry FlexFusion Air \u0026 Ceramic System, which adds volume and body while drying your hair. Both versions come with the Fusion brush attachment (a volumizing round brush that also dries and smooths), 1.25-inch curling barrels (which work similarly to the FlexStyle ones) plus a concentrator nozzle that you can add if you’re using the FlexFusion as a hair dryer. You can also customize your own bundle online so you can get exactly what you need in terms of styling attachments, and nothing you don’t. (BTW, the FlexStyle attachments are not compatible with the FlexFusion base, and vice versa.) What styles can you achieve with the FlexFusion? I have fine, thick hair with a slight wave pattern, and was able to achieve a wide range of looks with the FlexFusion. The first time I used it on freshly-washed hair by twisting the FlexFusion into its angled dryer shape and rough-drying to remove excess water. Then, I straightened the tool, popped the Fusion Brush on, and brushed from the underside of my length to dry while adding volume. The result was a smooth, natural-looking blowout with plenty of volume (but not like, “big Texas hair” volume.) If you’ve used a tool like the internet-famous Revlon heated brush, you will love Shark’s version. I have a ton of hair and could still do my whole head in less than 10 minutes. Even on the highest heat and air settings, it felt pretty gentle on my head. (There’s also a Scalp Shield mode that automatically adjusts temperature to protect your scalp from heat damage.) From there, I added a little bit of texture spray for some light hold, and boom: I looked like I left the salon.  The next time I washed my hair, I rough-dried and used the Straightener attachment to get a sleeker style. Again, as someone who usually waits hours for my hair to completely air-dry, the speed with which this works is pretty impressive. I am an Airstrait apologist, but even I had to admit that this one worked just as well, if not better, to smooth and dry damp hair in a matter of passes. Can it be used on dry hair? On dry hair, I refreshed a two-day blowout with the curl barrels. I’ll be totally honest: These are not my favorite. I’ve owned my Airwrap for years, and the curl attachments are starting to collect dust because I use them so infrequently. (I am team paddle or round brush attachment.) While they may be gentler on hair, I vastly prefer the ease and precision of a curling iron for achieving loose, beachy waves. (I also like to leave my ends out for more of a cool-girl vibe, and I find that hard to do with both my Airwrap and Shark.) If you’ve used the Airwrap or FlexStyle to curl your hair, it’s basically the same thing with the FlexFusion. If you haven’t, there’s a bit of a learning curve. Unlike the new Airwrap (which has multi-directional barrels), the Shark curlers go in one direction, meaning you’ll have to switch halfway through for each side of your head if you want your curls to sweep away from your face. From there, take small sections of hair and carefully feed it into the top-to-middle of the barrel, slowly moving the tool upwards to “catch” the remainder of the length as it wraps around the rest of the barrel. I used low heat and low air because the stronger the air was, the more I found that it would blow other sections of my hair around it while I was wielding the tool, resulting in a messy, bedhead look. DashDividers_1_500x100 Is the FlexFusion worth it? Depending on the bundle and attachments you choose, the Shark FlexFusion retails from $329.99 to $399.99. It’s still expensive, to be sure — but definitely more palatable than the $600 Dyson Airwrap from purely a cost perspective. I have to say, few tools work as well as this one in terms of versatility; whether you’re looking for straight and sleek or bouncy, Farrah Fawcett curls, the FlexFusion can get it done. All in all, I’m very impressed — and personally won’t be surprised if I see the nifty new gadget topping wish lists this holiday season. Like what you see?

    "description": "Every year, it's natural to look for new ways to add some excitement to your life. Instead of jumping out of a plane or traveling to the farthest country you can think of, what easier (and more low-stakes) way to inject some fun into your life than dusting off your \"haircut ideas\" board on Pinterest? Keeping up-to-date on the latest haircut styles allows you to keep tabs on what's new in the space, and over the next few months, it'll be all about having fun with your look. As Jae-Manuel Cardenas, a hairstylist at Sally Hershberger NoMad in New York City, put it: \"This year is all about texture and movement. I love to give hair a refresh by adding fresh, choppy layers. Hair [will] look sexy and undone.\" That's not all. There will be cool shorter cuts and haircut ideas for medium length (plus those in between lengths), but each one follows three common denominators: they are fresh, fun, and anything but boring - and isn't that what everybody wants when they go in for a makeover? From the bold \"jellyfish\" cut to the more subtly layered shag, there are enough hair ideas to fill an entire inspiration board. Don't just take our word for it. We've asked a handful of experts to break down the hottest looks you should know about, including haircuts for curly hair and all other hair types. Get loads of inspiration photos on how to wear them and learn insider techniques to level up your look - that you'll want to bring to your next salon appointment, so you can kick off the new season right.

    "title": "This Handy Makeup Stack Helped Declutter My Travel Bag",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/subtl-beauty-stak-review-49401881",
    "description": "I always try to pack minimally, and I can attribute this to one thing: a fateful (maybe traumatic?) pass through Heathrow security. I - plus a full-sized foundation and mini body lotion - fell victim to the airport's strictly enforced one clear-bag policy. And since that day, I've kept my eyes peeled for new ways to cut down on the number of liquids in my carry-on and declutter my makeup bag. One makeup product I came across that could seemingly address both of those concerns is Subtl Beauty's portable makeup Subtl Staks ($36). The makeup kit comes with almost everything you'd need to apply makeup on the go - a mirror flip-top, makeup compacts of your choice, and a brush base. Plus, all the makeup products are available in a cream or powder formula that can bypass that dreaded liquids policy. It seemed like the perfect way to keep my makeup routine in one place no matter where I was going - on a trip, to the gym, or just a night out. So, of course, when given the opportunity, I had to try it out. Check out my review of a Subtl Beauty Stak ahead and see why it's become one of my favorite products. About the Subtl Beauty Stak Subtl Beauty's custom and premade makeup Staks feature a variety of products and shades. Products include: cream concealers, lip and cheek duos, shine control pressed powders, cream highlighters, eyeshadow duos, bronzers, powder blushes, powder highlighters, and lip balms. Staks come in individually packaged, stackable layers. To assemble the tower, screw the mirror layer, makeup layers, and brush layers together. The makeup products are cruelty-free, vegan, gluten-free, fragrance-free, and paraben-free. What I Like About the Subtl Beauty Stak First and foremost, I was impressed by how pigmented the products in my Stak were. My premade Subtl Stak was part of the brand's Road Trip collection, which featured a powder highlighter in Golden Gimlet (a shimmery golden nude), a lip and cheek duo in Guava Getaway (a rosy brown), and powder blush in Apricot Avenue (a soft peachy pink) - and all the shades appeared on my skin with just a few light swipes from a brush or my fingertips. A little went a long way with each of these products, but especially that lip and cheek duo, which I layered under the powdered blush. This color combination made for a very glowy but naturally sunkissed look that I'd sport even in the winter. The quality of the makeup definitely stood up to my full-sized favorites, but what I loved most was how easy it was to throw in my carry-on, gym bag, or even a small shoulder bag. With my fingertips and the brush that came in the little tower, I felt like I could touch up or apply my makeup just about anywhere. I also went from toting eight separate products in my toiletry bag to five - which left only three liquid makeup products in my bag (a tinted moisturizer, mascara, and brow gel) and freed up space for other important liquids like SPF or body lotion. Overall, the Stak was the convenient, space-saving, and travel-friendly solution I was looking for. (Note: The Road Trip collection is sold out, but the individual shades listed above are still available to include in personalized Staks.) What to Consider Before Trying a Subtl Beauty Stak I went for a premade Stak, but personally found myself wanting to order more layers after using it a few times. For that reason, I recommend taking the quiz on Subtl Beauty's site to figure out what stack configuration makes the most sense for you. However, you can always add more products to your Stak later. I had a blush, highlighter, and cheek and lip duo in my original premade tower, but later decided to add a bronzer layer to better complete my face makeup routine. It's also worth noting that not every product can make it into your Stak. If you're like me, you'll probably find yourself packing a tinted moisturizer, brow gel, mascara, and an eyelash curler to complement it. But that's OK with me because the Stak helps to declutter my makeup bag considerably anyway. Who a Subtl Beauty Stak Is Best For Subtl Beauty's makeup Staks are great for anyone doing their makeup on the go. Instead of toting multiple products around, you can keep most everything in one little tower. It's also great for travelers, especially those who prefer to travel with a carry-on and need to cut down the number of liquids in their bag. Where Is the Subtl Beauty Stak Available? You can create a personalized Stak on the brand's site or shop premade staks on Amazon.
