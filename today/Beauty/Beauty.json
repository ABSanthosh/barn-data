    "title": "11 Double French Manicure Ideas That Are Cooler Than The Classic",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/double-french-manicure-trend?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "While nail art trends come and go faster than you can say “glazed donut”, there is one nail look that never dwindles in popularity: the French manicure. New interpretations of this classic nail style emerge each season, like the “deconstructed” French manicure, micro French tips and the chic French fade. There’s no denying that this timeless style has to be one of the most versatile manicures to opt for. It’s this latest iteration of the French manicure that has really got us excited for our next salon appointment, though. Enter: the double French manicure. Also known as “floating French tips”, the double French follows the same arched style as the classic French manicure, but with two strips of color at the tip instead of the single strip of white. It provides the perfect opportunity to play with different shades and widths and is pretty straightforward to achieve in a salon, or even at home if you have a small nail art brush. “I think floating French tips really resonate because of their versatility,” explains Kirsten White, nail technician and CEO and founder of London Grace. “The negative space created by the design can showcase the natural nail while also adding a touch of colur in an interesting way. It’s the perfect nail art if you want your nails to make a statement and still look elegant.” Ahead, we’ve pulled together 11 of our favorite double French manicure ideas to inspire your next nail appointment. Golden Touch View this post on Instagram A post shared by Emma (@nails.byemmaess) The sliver of gold at the tips of this irregular French manicure by Emma, aka @nails.byemmaess, adds a subtle hint of sparkle. It’s a chic nod to the double French trend and an undeniable winner for wedding season. Ruby Red View this post on Instagram A post shared by Iram Shelton (@iramshelton) A glossy red polish always looks good — and it looks even better when used to create these beautiful floating French tips by nail artist Iram Shelton. Get the look at home with Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Nail Polish in Rhapsody Red, $12.99. Pastel Pop View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Nail Gal (@thenailgaledinburgh) Pastel minimalism is dominating in this summer’s biggest nail trends. These candy-colored tips by Zara at The Nail Gal look so good paired with a more dialed-down nude base. Neon Glow View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sadie J Nails (@sadiejnails) Proving that negative space manicures aren’t just for minimalists, this vibrant orange double French style by nail artist and content creator Sadie Jordan is so playful and perfect for sunshine season. China Glaze Nail Lacquer in Orange Knockout, $6.19, will help you recreate the look at home. If you prefer shorter nails, take inspiration from this neon orange and pastel blue combo by Lois Samantha. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lois Samantha (@polishedbylolo) Electric Blue View this post on Instagram A post shared by Karma 💋 BRIGHTON NAIL ARTIST (@nailsby.karma) Floating French tips provide the perfect opportunity to experiment with nail polish shades that you might otherwise steer clear of. This ’80s-inspired cobalt blue nail art by Karma looks so crisp teamed with a simple nude base. Essie Butler Please, $10, is a great option if you want to try a similar color for yourself. Not sold on cobalt? The trend is equally as cute with baby blue, like these right angle tips by nail artist and educator Bryony Howell. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Bryony Howell (@gelsbybry) Technicolor Clash View this post on Instagram A post shared by Melanie Graves (@overglowedit) While a lot of the double French nail art looks leave some bare space between the lines, this one pairs a vibrant tip with a micro line of contrasting color for a kaleidoscopic effect. Look to Melanie Graves for inspiration. Monochrome Tips View this post on Instagram A post shared by Iram Shelton (@iramshelton) Why were French tips ever white when black looks this good? From the almond-shaped nails to the effortlessly sophisticated onyx double tips, this nail art by Iram Shelton is simple yet striking. For the perfect glossy black shade, try OPI Infinite Shine in Black Onyx, $11.99. Gilded Pine View this post on Instagram A post shared by Amy Le (@amyle.nails) This teeny-tiny line of gold would pair perfectly with basically any nail color, but these deep forest green tips are undeniably captivating. Take inspiration from nail artist Amy Le. Open Space View this post on Instagram A post shared by M e g (@gel.bymegan) Taking negative space to the extreme by bringing the second line of color down past the midpoint of the nail, these micro metallic lines by manicurist Megan prove that sometimes simple nail art can be the most impactful. Red Carpet Manicure Flash Glitter Special Effect Gel Polish, $10.99, will help you recreate this minimalist style at home. Rose Gold View this post on Instagram A post shared by Amy Le (@amyle.nails) There’s a cute preppiness to this double French look by Amy Le, where instead of leaving the floating gold lines blank, they’ve been filled with a pop of candy pink polish. Minimal Simplicity View this post on Instagram A post shared by KENZO NAIL STUDIO (@kenzonailstudio) Pared back and elegant, there’s no arguing with how stylish this simple take on floating French tips looks. Courtesy of Kenzo Nail Studio, it’s a graceful nod to the classic French manicure, but with a modern upgrade. All you need is a steady hand and an opaque white polish like Sally Hansen Insta Dry Nail Polish in White on Time, $5.99, to get the look on your own.
