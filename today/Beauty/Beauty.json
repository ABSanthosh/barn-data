    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/utah-curls-49348091",
    "description": "If your TikTok FYP is anything like mine, it's probably filled with beauty-centric posts. Any time I'm scrolling the app, I can guarantee I'll learn about a new skin-care product, a fun nail trend, or an easy hair hack (with the occasional tarot card reader telling me my ex-boyfriend is thinking of me sprinkled in). The app has helped me master how to create the perfect winged eyeliner on downturned eyes, how to get a voluminous ponytail, and how to nail the best \"my lips but better\" makeup combo. Recently, I've been seeing everyone on the app going bananas over \"Utah curls.\" At first glance, I didn't really see what the big deal was, but after seeing countless videos over the last month, and spending a few hours Googling, \"what are Utah curls?\" it was clear that I needed to try them out. The curls are loose, bouncy, and different from your run-of-the-mill beach wave. Keep scrolling to learn more about the hair trend, find out how you can do it at home, and see what my results were after trying it out for myself. What Are Utah Curls? @sydneyjcutler Since it pains me to see y’all restraightening your ends 😩 #hairtutorial #hairtok #utahhair #utahcurls #utah ♬ original sound - Syd So, what are Utah Curls? At first glance, they might just look like your average beachy wave, but they're actually a bit different. One key difference is that Utah curls have straight ends, whereas beachy waves don't. Also, beachy waves can usually be achieved using any kind of hot tool - such as a wand, a curling iron, or even a flat iron - but to get Utah curls right, you need a curling iron with a clamp. How to Get Utah Curls If you're a beginner to using a curling iron, it might take a bit to master. I'm pretty adept with mine, but this took even me a few tries to get right. To start, you want dry, preferably smooth hair that has been blown out. Next, I used the Drybar Hot Toddy Heat Protectant Mist ($29) all over my head. If you're using hot tools, you absolutely need a heat protectant. I love this one because you can use it on dry hair without getting that wet feeling. After dividing it into sections, I took the T3 SinglePass 1 in Curling Iron ($170) and began curling. I've tested a lot of curling irons over the years, but this is the one I always go back to. It's the best option for beachy waves, loose waves, and everything in between (and ultimately I think it's what made my Utah curls look their best). If you're trying to achieve the look at home, your best bet is looking for an instructional video. In my opinion, it's a lot easier to watch and try to replicate the movement than follow a written tutorial. I started by clamping my hair with the iron about mid-way down and then curled upward, away from my face. However, the key to Utah curls isn't how you curl, it's how you unravel. While unwrapping, I twisted the curling iron underneath and behind the strand of hair. When I got to the ends, I dragged down to make sure they were straight. Immediately after each curl, I made sure to let it cool in the shape it was in. Once my entire head was finished, I brushed through the ends with a wide-tooth comb. The tutorial I watched said to use a light-hold hairspray and even some hair paste, but I opted to forgo additional products entirely. My Utah Curls Results Overall, I liked my Utah curls, but they weren't my favorite hairstyle. I'm much more into a sleek, bouncy blowout achieved with my Dyson Airwrap, but this worked for me - especially for a second-day look. I think this hairstyle looks best on medium-length to super-long hair. I've seen it done on short hair, but in my opinion, it doesn't quite have the same effect, especially if the hair is layered.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/upside-down-hair-washing-editor-experiment-48941043",
    "description": "I've washed my hair countless times, but I've never considered changing the way that I did it. I've always rinsed, shampooed, rinsed, conditioned, and rinsed one last time. Why fix what's not broken, right? But TikTok has other ideas. One night, I stumbled across a video on upside-down hair washing, in which the creator shared her hair-care routine that included shampooing and conditioning her head in the shower upside down. When I told the rest of the beauty team about this strange hair-washing technique, all but one person - who regularly follows this hack, as well as the reverse hair-washing technique herself - were just as surprised as I was. The reasoning for doing this, so I'm told, is to help add volume and body to any hair type - especially if it's fine. And as someone who fits that description, I was game to try it. The next time I showered, instead of using my shampoo and conditioner the way I've done it for the past two-plus decades, I flipped my head upside down. First, I'll say this: in order to pull off upside-down hair washing, you absolutely need a detachable shower head with a hose. But even with that, it's no easy task. The entire practice felt very strange - water gets everywhere if you're not careful. I used my Balmain Homme Treatment Bodyfying Shampoo ($72) and Balmain Homme Treatment Bodyfying Conditioner ($87) for the process, which already boast volumizing ingredients. With my head upside down and the shower nozzle dangling quite frantically, I lathered the roots of my hair, concentrating the shampoo on my scalp and not really worrying about washing my ends. Once that step was done, still with my head upside down (water in my ears, and soap in my eyes. . .), I rinsed the shampoo out. Using my conditioner next, I focused on the ends of my hair this time, avoiding my roots - something I do when I wash my hair right side up, too, to keep from weighing my hair down. After giving my head one final rinse, I was finished with the entire upside-down hair-washing process. It definitely took me longer than usual to do, but my hair surprisingly already felt softer to the touch, which gave me hope. Out of the shower, I put my hair up in a towel to dry a little bit before putting in a styling cream and blasting it with some heat (also while upside down - are you sensing a theme?). Already, my hair looked fluffier and had more volume, especially at the roots, which usually lay flat against my head. Because at this point I looked a little bit like a poodle that just got blow-dried, I decided to curl my hair with my Mermade Waver to see how that'd look. This is where the magic really happened. My hair retained its volume and had so much more bounce than it usually does. Despite being chaotic to do, upside-down hair washing really did give my fine hair next-level body, and the result was long lasting. This is definitely a trick I'll keep up my sleeve for days when I plan on heat styling in the future.

    "title": "“Wellness” Nails To Navy Blue: 12 Nail Trends That Are Going To Reign In 2025",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-art-manicure-trends-2025?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "The year might not be over just yet but with my New Year’s Eve nails all booked, I’m looking ahead to 2025 to collect ideas for my January manicure. And while 2024 has more than delivered on amazing trends to take inspiration from (I’m talking glass nails, chrome manicures and fresh takes on French tips), I’m glad to report that next year looks even better when it comes to incredible nail looks. Whether you’re into a minimalist manicure or bedazzled nail art with all the trimmings, 2025 looks set to deliver on color, texture and nail health. But don’t take my word for it. I caught up with some of the best nail artists in the business to get their predictions on what lies ahead for our nails next year. Here’s all the inspiration you need. Wellness Nails View this post on Instagram A post shared by Harriet Westmoreland (@harrietwestmoreland) The “clean girl” nail aesthetic has been one of the most enduring nail trends of the last couple of years but in 2025 we’ll see it go one step further with a focus on nail health. “Nail care is evolving, with a focus on health-conscious products that support and protect natural nails,” says Juanita Huber-Millet, founder and creative director of Townhouse. “From breathable polishes to strengthening treatments, consumers are seeking out products designed to provide a nourishing, wellness-led experience that support natural nail growth.” Manucurist’s Active Glow in Raspberry, $19, is a 2-in-1 treatment polish that leaves nails with a rosy sheen while nourishing them with sweet almond oil and raspberry extract. Navy Blue View this post on Instagram A post shared by Julia Diogo (@paintedbyjools) All the nail experts are in agreement: Navy blue will be on everyone’s nails in 2025. “Blues in general will be popular but navy will continue to be a standout color for the upcoming seasons,” says session manicurist Ami Streets. “It’s a chic, deep hue that looks great as an edgier manicure color while still being softer and more elegant than black.” Julia Diogo’s perfectly executed navy nails are timeless. Try Chanel Le Vernis Nail Color in 127 Fugueuse, $32, for a luxurious at-home manicure. Milky Pastels View this post on Instagram A post shared by Julia Diogo (@paintedbyjools) There’s nothing new about pastels, especially in spring and summer, so it’s no surprise that all the experts I spoke to predicted they’ll make a resurgence next year. However, 2025’s iteration is going to be more pared-back than ever. “As we move into spring, I’m expecting milky shades that provide a fresh, [clean] aesthetic to be popular as they look effortlessly beautiful and put-together,” predicts international nail artist and one of Bio Sculpture’s top technicians, Julia Diogo. Her soft lavender manicure in Bio Sculpture Fluttering Lavender, $13, fits the aesthetic perfectly.  Marble Elements View this post on Instagram A post shared by San Sung Kim | 김산성 (@sansungnails) Streets has marbling pinned as a nail trend that’s set to take off in 2025. “Marbling inspired by natural events like the sunrise, skies or the ocean works really well interpreted into nail art looks, so I think this trend will be one to watch,” she says. This marbled take on a sunset by San Sung Kim is so beautiful that it might just be first on my new year manicure wish list.  Tiffany Blue View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jaz (@paintbyjaz) Call it Tiffany blue, turquoise or aqua, this holiday-ready cyan might just be the breakout shade of 2025. Diogo notes the influence of “Tiffany blue taking over recent catwalks” as an indicator of what’s to come, while Streets talks of “aqua blues and greens inspired by the ocean with opalescent or shimmering finishes” emerging as popular choices next year. OPI’s Nail Lacquer in My Dogsled is a Hybrid, $11.99, is a similar sea green to the one used in Jaz’s minimalist double French manicure. Velvet Shine View this post on Instagram A post shared by Queenie Nguyen | elevated nail artist (@nailartbyqueenie) Texture is going to be huge next year and velvet finishes look set to adorn everyone’s nails. “Texture is really going to take centre stage in 2025 and velvet delivers on both depth and dimension,” explains Huber-Millet. “It’s a subtle yet impactful design that will appeal to those who like more intricate details over ostentatious embellishments.” Queenie Nguyen’s cinnamon velvet nails make for the perfect cosy fall and winter look. Recreate it at home with Beauty Pie’s Wondercolor Nail Polish in Bright Bronze, $14. Micro French View this post on Instagram A post shared by CORRINNA BIANCA | LONDON (@corrinnabianca) Not all of 2025’s nail trends are going to be new; there are plenty of manicure looks that have proved popular this year that experts think will stick around for the long haul. “Minimalist nail art isn’t going anywhere,” declares pro nail artist and educator Jessica White. “Designs like micro French tips have become staples because they’re wearable and versatile.” Corrinna Bianca’s cold brew latte French tips are so delicately painted and chic. Try it yourself (with a steady hand!) using Essie Nail Polish in Odd Squad, $11.10. Three-Dimensional View this post on Instagram A post shared by Melanie Graves (@overglowedit) Diogo is unequivocal about one thing for 2025: It’s all about dimension. “3D nail art was one of the biggest trends of 2024 and I have no doubt that it will continue to dominate in 2025,” she says. “I’m absolutely loving 3D swirls and outlines right now. It’s a great option for anyone who wants to try something a little playful.” Melanie Graves has shared so many amazing multidimensional manicures this year, but this monochromatic look is particularly cool. Fine Embellishment View this post on Instagram A post shared by Wendy (@mydumbnails) While 3D texture and nail decorations will continue to trend, Streets predicts a shift towards a more minimalist approach to adornment in 2025. “Embellishments will still be super popular but I think that these will be toned down in favor of more refined adornments like pearls and crystals,” she explains. Wendy’s shimmering manicure is both pretty and pared back. Get your hands on Pueen Nail Charms Multi Shapes Nail Art Kit, $5.74, which contains so many beautiful pearls and gems, to create your own version at home. Rich Burgundy View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lauren ✨ (@lolo.nailedit) While linen pastels and milky hues will take off for spring, we can still expect to see deep, rich shades reign supreme in 2025. This year’s obsession with chocolate brown will continue but we’ll see a shift towards merlot and burgundy, as illustrated by Lauren’s sultry red manicure. “Burgundy is going to remain a favorite in 2025,” confirms Diogo. “I’m noticing a lot of buzz around Bio Sculpture’s new Ghost Noir polish [available to licensed professionals only] which is nearly black with deep red undertones for a mysterious yet sophisticated vibe.” Celestial Yellow View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sonia Sanchez | GelX Nail Artist | 818 San Fernando Valley (@klawsbysonia) As we move into summer, experts agree that oranges and yellows are going to be hugely popular for manicures. “Bold orange and energizing yellow colors will really liven up your manicure in 2025’s warmer months,” predicts Streets. But it’s “celestial yellow” that she thinks is going to be everywhere. “Inspired by otherworldly elements like the sun, moon and stars, it’s one to add vibrancy to your nail look,” she says. Try OPI Nail Lacquer in Exotic Birds Do Not Tweet, $11.99, to recreate Sonia Sanchez’s embellished citrus manicure at home. Subtle Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by @yo_keshh “Chrome nails have been everywhere this year but I think they may start to feel overdone as we move into 2025,” says White. She predicts that rather than a “full-coverage chrome finish”, we’ll see a shift towards more subtle chrome accents and softer detailing for a more understated take on the trend. Keshia’s abstract gold chrome tips are the perfect example. Like what you see?

From the “kicked” bob (an ultra-short crop with flicked out ends) to the “clavi” cut (a mid-length chop that skims the clavicle or collarbone), we weren’t short on haircut inspiration in 2024. But with a new year comes a fresh perspective — and countless more ways to wear our hair, too. If you’re keen to switch things up this January, look no further. Ahead, we asked a handful of London’s most sought-after hairstylists for their 2025 haircut predictions. There’s something for everyone, whatever your hair type or texture. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Snack-Size Bob View this post on Instagram A post shared by Cassidy Gurev (@hairbycassidy_) Anita Rice, cofounder of Buller and Rice, says that the bob will live on in 2025 but it’ll get even shorter. “The snack-size bob, also known as the ‘kick’ bob, sits at the jawline and flicks out at the bottom,” Rice explains. “It boasts blunt edges but there’s a lightly chopped texture [throughout] to add a little bit of versatility, so that you can flip around easily.” Rice suggests it works best with a side parting, slicked back with gel or mousse, or tucked behind the ears. The inspiration? Think musician Låpsley, says Rice, or this cut posted to Instagram by hairstylist Cassidy Gurev of The Hair Bros.  The Boxie View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rubi (@poseandrepeat) The “bixie”, a cross between a bob and a pixie cut, is getting something of an upgrade for 2025. Enter: the “boxie”, which is a little longer and less maintenance, says James Bickmore, art director at Neil Moodie Studio. “It’s perfect for those who are growing out a pixie but don’t want a bob,” he says. “It’s easy to manage and gets better as it grows out. It has a very ‘I woke up like this’ vibe — with a bit of an edge.” Take inspiration from content creator Rubi on Instagram. The Low Cut View this post on Instagram A post shared by barbie ™ (@loc._queen) Lorraine Dublin, a celebrity hairstylist, hair expert and educator, predicts that the “low” cut — as seen on Rihanna recently — is going to be a bold and beautiful hair statement in 2025. “This style showcases how to elevate your natural curls while keeping things low maintenance,” says Dublin. “To achieve this look, start by cutting your 4A curls to remove dead ends and any chemical treatments. Rihanna opts for a shorter length, but this style can also be customized with slightly longer layers for a softer look.” Keen to go even shorter? Look to model @loc._queen on Instagram. As for colou, Dublin says that golden tones add warmth and dimension, complementing the texture beautifully. “To style, I’d recommend starting with a hydrating shampoo and conditioner, followed by a deep-conditioning mask,” says Dublin. “Fenty Comeback Kid Leave-In Conditioner, $36, and Homecurl Curl Defining Cream, $28, are perfect for enhancing and shaping curls,” she adds. “Use your fingers or a wide-tooth comb to define the curls further, creating a polished yet effortless finish.” Bangs-Meets-Layers View this post on Instagram A post shared by G R A C E A M E L I A (@graceamelia___) If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it, suggests Zoe Adams, international artist at Taylor Taylor London. “[Bangs] paired with layers is making a strong comeback for 2025, offering a soft and romantic aesthetic,” she says. “The layered structure creates movement, while the bangs frame the face, adding definition and depth.” Even better, this style is ideal for most hair lengths, says Adams, but it works especially well for those with thicker hair looking to add lightness and shape. Anything goes, too. “Curtain bangs, wispy [bangs] or bold, blunt bangs can all complement layered cuts beautifully,” says Adams. This heavily layered cut by Grace Amelia hits the nail on the head. The Mixie ’25 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Hair by Andy Judd (@andy_doesyourhair) Cut by Andy Judd, this mullet-meets-pixie on Addie Jean Carroll is the cut of 2025. “The mixie is full of texture,” says Rice. “It’s essentially an outgrown pixie with soft edges around the hairline, but length at the back can be kept longer to create a wolf cut variation.” According to Rice, the less styling, the better. “Wear it natural for a ‘bedhead’ look,” she says. “Consider heavily texturized [bangs]; the length can be adjusted to your taste.” The Italian Bob 2.0 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Athisha Khan (@athishakhan) With both Bickmore and Adams singing its praises, the Italian bob is in no danger of becoming outdated, but thanks to the abundance of nifty hot brushes out there, we’re going to play around with the size. Take a cue from this cut on Athisha Khan. Try the ghd Rise Professional Hot Brush, $167. Characterized by soft, subtle layers that sit just above the shoulders, Bickmore says the Italian bob offers the perfect balance of volume and movement. “It’s effortlessly chic, low maintenance and works beautifully with natural textures, making it an ideal choice for those looking to combine style with ease,” he says. If your hair is on the fine side, Adams suggests asking your stylist for blunt ends to maximize the volume. “Whether styled sleek or with a soft wave, the Italian bob adds a touch of European elegance to any look,” she says. Triple XL Hair View this post on Instagram A post shared by Alyssa / curly hair friend ❀ (@alyssarxs) XL = extra long à la Charli xcx. “We’ve been seeing so much long long long hair (hence triple XL), and it’s mostly worn with natural texture,” says Rice, like this cut on digital creator Alyssa. “Achieving this look won’t happen overnight but as we’ve seen so many times on the catwalk or in editorials, you can opt for a little help from clip-in extensions.” And if your hair is naturally this long? Maintain it well, says Rice: “Get your hair cut regularly — every six to eight weeks — and invest in conditioning treatments.” Try Davines Nou Nou Hair Mask, $40. “If your hair is [naturally wavy or curly], let it air-dry or diffuse and use a hair wand for extra waves if needed,” adds Rice. Try ghd Creative Curl Wand, $209. The Short Pixie Wig View this post on Instagram A post shared by G R A C E A M E L I A (@graceamelia___) If you don’t want to brave the scissors, Dublin says that a short pixie wig is an excellent way to play with a new style and shade sans permanent change. “This protective style allows you to enjoy a bold, cropped look without cutting or coloring your natural hair,” she says, pinpointing Leomie Anderson as inspiration. “Wigs and extensions are also perfect for people who frequently change their hairstyles or need to protect their hair from damage,” she says. “If you’re looking for versatility and protection, this trend is a game-changer.” Look to digital creator Thai. Brow Bone Contouring View this post on Instagram A post shared by Q. (@callherrq) Bangs will become mini hairstyles in their own right, suggests hairstylist Tom Smith. “In 2025 we’ll see a variety of fusions of previously popular [bang] styles,” he tells R29. “Birkin bangs [inspired by the late Jane Birkin], bottleneck bangs [between curtain bangs and full bangs], curtain bangs, micro [bangs] and various other brow- and cheekbone-skimming lengths will be customized to frame the eyes with softly textured and choppy pieces.” “[Bangs] like these are great for those who want something low-commitment because they’re softer and grow out gently, meaning they don’t require regular trimming,” adds Smith. He suggests asking your stylist what would work best for your face shape: “[This is important because they’ll] consider the size of your forehead, whether you want to show off your eyebrows or cheekbones and make sure you’re willing to tweak the style every morning. You’ll need to reset this area of your hair every day, so while it can be done quickly, it does require some daily maintenance.” We love these face-framing bangs on digital creator Q. The Modern Curly Mullet View this post on Instagram A post shared by Tiff McColl 🐸🧚🏼‍♂️🍒 🐕🐕‍🦺 ✨FREE PALESTINE🍉 (@tiffmccoll) The mullet is making a major comeback, according to Dublin, and the modern iteration is made for those with curly hair. “[Women with curls] are reimagining this iconic cut with their natural textures,” says Dublin. “The look features shorter layers at the top and sides with longer, free-flowing curls at the back,” she adds, much like this style by hairstylist Tiff McColl. “The shape enhances volume and movement, and it’s perfect for those who want to push boundaries and pay homage to a style with rich cultural history while staying true to their natural hair pattern,” adds Dublin. She recommends adding a leave-in conditioner and a curl-enhancing cream to your hairstyling arsenal. Try Cantu Argan Oil Leave-In Conditioning Repair Cream, $6.48, and Living Proof Curl Enhancer, $51.50. Anti Bangs View this post on Instagram A post shared by ✧✧ 𝕽𝖄𝕰𝕹𝕹𝕰 𝕾𝕹𝕺𝖂 ✧✧ (@ryennesnow.hair) “Considering that we’ve had so much interest in [bang] shapes over the past few years, I predict that 2025 is going to invite in [the opposite] in the form of elongated face-framing — no distinguishable layers or shaping around the face, but lengths that sit longer than the chin,” says Smith. Ryenne Snow nails it with this cut. The key to maintaining [bangs] like these is being kind on your strands. “Avoid splitting by turning down the heat on your tools and using a product like Olaplex No.3,” says Smith, which reduces breakage. “Concentrate it around the weaker hairline areas and be gentle when brushing,” he adds. The Luxe Bob View this post on Instagram A post shared by B L O N D E HELSINKI🇫🇮 (@blondehelsinki) The classic lob, aka long bob, will get a sleek, luxurious upgrade for 2025, says Sam Burnett, owner and creative director of Hare \u0026 Bone salon. “This cut sits just above the shoulders, with seamless layers throughout the mid-lengths and ultra-blunt edges that create a polished, clean finish,” says Burnett, like this cut by Blonde Helsinki. “It’s modern, low-maintenance and perfect for anyone who wants versatility because it can be air-dried for an effortless vibe or styled for an ultra-refined look,” says Burnett.  The Midi Flick View this post on Instagram A post shared by Francesca Inverarity (@frankie_inv) Smith cites Florence Pugh and Kendall Jenner as celebrity inspiration but this chunky, flicky, mid-length cut on Sana, created by Francesca Inverarity of The Hair Bros, is by far our favorite look. “Thanks to the virality of 2024’s ‘bell bottom’ bob [a kicked-out bob haircut], we’re going to see flicky and textured mid-length shapes lead the way for [hair] trends in 2025,” says Smith. He suggests asking your stylist for a textured and layered shape that sits around your collarbone. “It’s best styled with soft, messy waves or natural curls if you have them,” says Smith. “Use a texture spray to modernize and add volume to the result.” Try Living Proof Full Dry Volume and Texture Spray, $49. The Layered Curtain Cut View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nataliia Bumford (@nata.boo.hair) “This medium-length cut combines the softness of ‘70s-inspired layers with a modern edge,” says Burnett. Those layers should frame the face and blend seamlessly into the lengths. “[This provides] an airy, weightless effect,” adds Burnett. “It’s perfect for adding movement and dimension to thicker hair while bringing body and life to finer textures.” This cut by London-based hairstylist Nataliia Bumford is beautiful.  The Micro Contour Crop View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kiyotaka Tsutsumi (@kiyo_meynewyork) This is the evolution of the pixie cut. “It features sharp, tailored edges and subtle texturing around the face to sculpt and enhance your features,” says Burnett, like this cut by New York hairstylist Kiyotaka Tsutsumi. “It’s bold yet soft, framing the jawline and cheekbones beautifully and offering a fresh, edgy alternative.  Like what you see?
