    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find the best things to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.Stepping into a new year can often feel like you’re a bear who’s woken up halfway through hibernation. Thankfully, 2025 has plenty of glamorous occasions to keep us entertained as we shake off the shock, dust off our laptops, and jump back into the grind. The Golden Globes kicked off awards season with a long list of fashion and beauty knockout moments. Our favorites of the night were Ayo Edebiri’s ‘90s Julia Roberts-inspired gray Loewe suit, Zendaya’s burnt orange satin Louis Vuitton gown, and Kylie Jenner’s direct homage to Elizabeth Hurley’s backless Versace number, which really got the people talking. While our gaze is fixed on the red carpet for more amazing looks as the season ramps up, we’re also keeping an eye on the exciting launches happening in the fashion and beauty space this month. From a new Fenty Skin cleanser to a Louis Vuitton collaboration, click through to see all the new goodies heading your way this January.H\u0026M Studio’s Pre-Spring CapsuleDesigned with transitional dressing and warmer days in mind, H\u0026M Studio’s Pre-Spring Capsule collection features tailored wardrobe essentials with flowing fabrics and voluminous silhouettes — think a long collarless coat, an oversized leather jacket, a sleek black trench made with a windbreaker-type fabric, a wrap-around miniskirt and more. Pieces are available in a black and midnight blue color palette, while a yellow and purple crocus — one of the first blooms of spring — print is also available on a pair of leggings and handkerchief-hem maxi dress. Shop at hm.com on January 30Marine Serre x RepettoBalletcore is lingering for a little bit longer, thanks to the  Marine Serre x Repetto collaboration. The partnership between the two French brands infuses the former’s modern aesthetics with the latter’s classic dance style. (Repetto was founded in 1947 as a ballet shoe company.) The result is two shoe styles: the leather Lilouh flat, embossed with Serre’s signature crescent moon on the toe, and the Camille ballerina, which features a 1-inch block heel and is available in denim, black, white, and fire red moon prints. “As a child, I was captivated by the elegant style of Repetto ballerinas,” Serre said, in a press release. “On top of that, they were crafted near my home in Saint Médard d’Excideuil. For my sister and I, it was magical to visit this factory, which introduced us to the world of craftsmanship.”Shop now at repetto.com Repetto x Marine Serre Lilouh Ballet Flats, $, available at RepettoLouis Vuitton x Murakami Re-Edition CollectionWith Zendaya fronting the campaign, Louis Vuitton is straight out of the gate with the collaboration of the year. Twenty years after its first collection with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, the French luxury house is back with an internet-breaking re-edition. Leaning into Y2K nostalgia in all the right ways (Paris and Britney were both OG fans), the assortment includes the iconic bright monogrammed Speedy Bandoulière 25 bag, slingback mules, patterned silk scarves, and even a skateboard complete with the Superflat Panda — because why not? Shop at Louis Vuitton nowLouis Vuitton x Takashi Murakami Speedy Bandoulière 25, $, available at Louis VuittonConverse Valentine’s Day Collection + Alex Cosani CampaignConverse is celebrating the season of love with Alex Consani. The model stars in the footwear brand’s Valentine’s Day campaign, called “Love Me, Love Me Not,” highlighting the edgy and feminine sides of self-love. It introduces its themed collection, which includes a pair of Chuck 70 high-tops covered in rosettes, black leather Chuck 70 De Luxe platform heels with a heart-studded strap, pink low-tops, patent leather Mary Janes, rose-adorned apparel, and more.  Shop now at converse.com Converse Chuck 70 Valentine's Day, $, available at ConverseConverse Chuck 70 De Luxe Heel Platform Valentine's Day, $, available at ConverseJ.Crew Teams Up With AraksBefore launching her luxury intimates line Araks, Araks Yeramyan was a member of J.Crew’s design team. Now, the two have reunited with a limited-edition collection of lingerie and loungewear. The Araks x J.Crew capsule features a range of underwear and sleepwear featuring bold colors and elegant design details — think ice blue cotton-silk embroidered pajamas, berry-tinted bralettes, and a color-blocked slip dress with scalloped trims. “The pieces are both effortless and considered, chic without trying too hard,” Yeramyan said of the collab. “These are the clothes you’ll reach for without thinking, yet always feel good in. They carry a quiet confidence, the kind of ease that makes them as much a gift to yourself as anyone else.” Shop now at J.Crew Araks x J.Crew Midi Slip Dress, $, available at J.CrewAraks x J.Crew Beatrice Bralette, $, available at J.CrewPHLUR Golden Rule EDPPHLUR, the brand behind the viral Missing Person fragrance, is back with a new hypnotic scent. Enter: Golden Rule. Encased in a shimmering gold bottle, the brand describes the eau de parfum as “sensual,” combining notes of juicy mandarin and pink pepper with smooth coconut milk, vanilla cream, and orange flower. Warm and feminine, the fragrance is perfect for imbuing a sprinkle of summer into cold winter nights.Shop now at PhlurPhlur Golden Rule Eau de Parfum, $, available at PhlurRixo x Stripe \u0026 StareRixo is known for its playful prints and feminine silhouettes; Stripe \u0026 Stare is recognized for its ultra-comfortable and consciously-made underwear. The only question we have is: How has it taken this long for the two London-based brands to join forces? The Rixo x Stripe \u0026 Stare features must-have essentials (different cuts of underwear, camisoles, bodysuits, and even baby tees) in covetable and cutesy patterns — such as heart- and leopard-prints and florals — and a pair of briefs with the phrase “forget me not” etched across them. Pieces are available in US sizes 2 to 22, and made with 95-percent biodegradable fabric.  Shop at Rixo and Stripe \u0026 Stare on January 16 Fenty Skin Cherry Dub CleanserWhile we start yet another year screaming “Where is the album?!” to the sky, Rihanna remains booked and busy, launching a new lightweight gel cleanser. The product is all about harnessing the Barbados cherry, which is rich in vitamin C. Here the brightening ingredient is combined with niacinamide to improve skin texture and aloe juice for soothing inflammation. Shop now at Fenty BeautyFenty Beauty Cherry Dub Pore Purify'r Gel Cleanser, $, available at Fenty BeautyLoewe x OnSwiss running shoe brand On is one of the fastest growing brands on the market, working with megawatt talent like Zendaya and collaborating with buzzy designers like Jonathan Anderson through Loewe.

Brazilian Bum Bum Cream creators Sol de Janeiro are stepping up to the plate this month with the launch of a lightweight body oil scented with pink dragon fruit and hibiscus. Cacay oil is said to boost collagen and elastin production, while squalane plumps and amaranthus flower seed extract moisturize deeply. Be sure to apply to damp skin for maximum hydration.Shop now at SephoraSol de Janeiro Beija Flor Body Oil, $, available at SephoraLevi's x UNDERCOVERIn honor of its 35th anniversary, Japanese luxury streetwear brand Undercover has once again teamed up with Levi’s. The second collaboration between the two brands fuses their rich heritages. The nine-piece collection includes pieces like a denim trucker jacket with detachable zip detailing (a reference to Undercover’s fall/winter 1998 collection), a pair of 501 jeans with an embroidered zigzag pattern, and apparel with archival Undercover graphics. Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea stars in the campaign to promote the new drop. Shop at Levi’s on January 18 Jenny Bird Love CollectionValentine’s Day is just around the corner, meaning we’re allowed to continue buying gifts for others (and ourselves). Toronto-based jewelry designer Jenny Bird is keeping things classic with an array of heart-shaped accessories including a padlock heart pendant necklace, heart button studs, and a gold ring adorned with a dangling heart charm. Our favorites have to be the subtle heart puff earrings, which appear sculptural from the front and more abstract from the side view — perfect for the lovergirls who like to keep things on the down-low. Shop at Jenny BirdXO, Kitty x Good Light CosmeticsFor the rom-com lovers among us, the return of To All The Boys spinoff XO, Kitty is a welcome distraction from the miserable January weather. Not only is the show coming back to Netflix for a second season (with Peter Kavinsky in tow), it’s also teaming up with Korean beauty brand Good Light to launch a limited-edition lip bundle. The kit’s main gem is the Multi-Peptide Lip Nectar, a non-sticky lip hydrator with ingredients including lychee, vitamin C, glycerin, and yuzu seed peptide. There’s even a collectable keychain included in the backpack-inspired packaging.Shop from 16th January at ULTA Beauty.Like what you see?

There was a point not too long ago where it seemed I couldn’t get away from blindingly bright, dramatically strobed cheekbones and nose bridges all over my feed. Becca Cosmetics’ Champagne Pop Shimmering Skin Perfector (IYKYK) had me in a chokehold between the years of 2014-2016, until one day…it didn’t. Slowly but surely, I asked myself if highlighter was, in fact, dead. (On one hand, if you have to ask…) But the thing is, even if highlighter had fallen out of favor, glowy skin had not — that much was certain. “The strobing and highlighter craze perfectly aligned with the early years of beauty on social media, offering a bold, hyper-glowy complexion,” makeup artist and Sephora Beauty Director David Razzano tells Refinery29. “In truth, most people couldn’t translate these harsh strobed effects into daily life – it looked too intense.” (He’s not wrong, but also I think that may have been the point.) “I think that highlighting has quieted down a bit on social because skincare has taken a front seat,” says MAC Cosmetics Senior Artist Michelle Clark. “It’s more about skin artistry now and seeing your natural skin shine through.” So, just as skincare has become so deeply ingrained into beauty routines and social media discourse, it seems that the consensus is Why fake glowy skin when you can have the real thing? “People will always use highlighter, but now it’s less about on top of the makeup and more about creating well-hydrated, dewy skin that radiates through,” Clark adds. DashDividers_1_500x100 So, what exactly does “highlighter 2.0” look like? “In my opinion, the key to modern highlighting is to ensure that the result resembles natural, glowy skin,” says Razzano. “You want your skin to take center stage, not the makeup.” (Preach!) In lieu of see-it-from-space pops of dazzling shimmer, the 2025 interpretation of a highlighted complexion calls for naturally glowy skin that looks lit from within. “Using the correct formulas and techniques for your skin type will allow you to create a natural-looking finish,” Razzano says. “My favorite way to highlight the skin now is by focusing on skin prep to create a glowy complexion,” explains Clark, who also recommends massaging the face during this step to boost circulation and revive your complexion before a drop of makeup hits your face. “When it comes to modern highlighting, I like to use serums, oils or cream products under and over complexion products to create a seamless highlight,” she says. DashDividers_1_500x100 What products work best for a modern highlight? According to Razzano, the most important thing to keep in mind when highlighting is actually your skin type — and here’s why: “This is often overlooked by many, but it is the key to success: If someone has dry to normal skin, I’ll use a deeply hydrating moisturizer like Tatcha’s Dewy Skin Cream to prep because I want to achieve radiant skin through quality, long-lasting hydration, followed by Saie Glowy Super Gel all over the face to give a beautiful glow and radiance.” For the combination or oily girlies, Razzano suggests a “strategic” approach to highlighting. “This skin type will get a natural glow from oil production, so targeting specific areas is better here, since ‘all over glow’ would likely end up with an excessively shiny T-zone,” he explains. “I would likely use a lightweight moisturizer like Glow Recipe Watermelon Pink Juice to prep the skin with hydration that won’t add additional oil or shine to the face, then create radiance on targeted areas using a soft luminizer like Milk Makeup’s Dewy Cream Highlighter Stick for a beautiful, natural look that melts into the skin.” Clark also leans heavily into skin prep, adding a mist to both prep and set skin. “I never start makeup with dry skin — I use MAC Fix + Magic Radiance to mist the skin with a nourishing dose of Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid,” says Clark. “With it still damp, I will go in with few pumps of MAC Hyper Real Serumizer. These steps work together to create a smooth, glowy canvas for foundation and concealer.” With a dewy base, Clark then recommends “MAC’s glow duo” (the brand’s Studio Radiance Foundation and Studio Radiance Luminous Lift Concealer) to create highlighted skin using not highlighter, but strategically placed foundation and concealer. “I start with a single pump of foundation and create a veil of coverage all over the skin, then I go in specific areas — like the under eyes, around the nose and chin — to give a bit more coverage and luminosity.” Last step? “The final piece to a modern highlighted complexion is to take a pump of Serumizer and tap it on top of the cheekbones, bridge of the nose and cupid’s bow.” And voilà, naturally luminous skin that doesn’t look like a full face of glam — because as it turns out, the best highlighter is the one you don’t even see.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/rhode-peptide-lip-shape-review-49424828",
    "description": "A few weeks ago, it was brought to my attention that the one and only Hailey Bieber was possibly launching a lip liner. I was working, minding my own business, when one of my girlfriends sent me a screenshot of her Instagram Story holding what looked to be a Rhode lip pencil. If you know me personally, then you know I practically peed my pants with excitement because I have been waiting for this day for what feels like forever. Bieber (Hailey, not Justin - sorry, but I don't care about him) is my style icon, my makeup inspiration, and my hair goddess. I've loved (almost) every product she's launched, and I was hoping that this one would be no exception. When I got the official word about the Rhode Peptide Lip Shape ($24), I couldn't wait to get my hands on the product. I was counting down the days until it finally landed in my mailbox. And yes, I know I sound like I simp for Hailey, and truth be told, I kinda do - but I was ready to judge this product just like any other lippie in my rotation. Which is to say harshly, if need be. So, here we are. Keep scrolling to read my full review and find out if the Rhode Peptide Lip Shape is worth the hype. About the Rhode Peptide Lip Shape This product is a contouring lip shaper with a creamy formula and easy-to-use twist-up applicator. It enhances the appearance and fullness of lips. The key ingredients include peptides to soften lips and fenugreek extract to enhance lip volume and firmness. It comes in 11 shades. It's fragrance-free, cruelty-free, gluten-free, and vegan. What I Like About the Rhode Peptide Lip Shape I tested three shades: Lift, Press, and Twist. Lift (a soft natural pink) and Press (a warm pinky mauve) are both similar to my natural lip color. Twist, on the other hand, is described as a warm taupe, and it looked fairly brown on my lips. All in all, I felt like all three shades that I tested were very natural and looked great. The actual product is a bit larger and has a more rounded shape than a traditional lip pencil. The texture is also a little creamier and thicker, which made applying it to my lips extremely easy. It reminded me more of a lip crayon than a pencil, but it still had great definition. It's a twist-up applicator, so you don't have to deal with sharpening it - a major bonus, in my opinion. How to Use the Rhode Peptide Lip Shape The brand recommends gliding the product along the outline of your lips and then taking the silicone smudger (built-in on the other end of the tube) to diffuse the shade or clean up the edges. I'm not a huge fan of over-lining my lips, so when I use this product, I opt to line my lips and then smudge it out with my finger. (I don't love the silicone smudger for blending because I think it removes too much product.) I like to follow it up with a little Aquaphor if I'm going for a more low-key look. Otherwise, I'll use a shiny gloss or my Rhode Peptide Lip Treatment directly on top. What to Consider Before Trying the Rhode Peptide Lip Shape The Rhode Peptide Lip Shape is one of the creamiest lip liner products I've tested. I love how smooth it goes on and how easy it is to blend. However, because it's so creamy, I do find that it doesn't last as long as I would like. My hack for fixing this is to make sure my lips are completely clean and free of product prior to applying, and then I like to take a tiny bit of translucent powder and dab it onto my mouth with a powder puff. From there, I apply my lip liner and then go over it with a lip gloss. Where the Rhode Peptide Lip Shape Is Available The Rhode Peptide Lip Shape is available directly on a brand's website.

    "title": "It's 2025, Why Are We Still Fighting For DEI in Beauty?",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/diversity-inclusion-beauty-important-49424628",
    "description": "As diverse as the beauty industry seems at face value, marginalized entrepreneurs and employees have always had to fight for a seat at the table. This reality is becoming even more apparent during the first weeks of the new presidential administration, during which Trump imposed an executive order to purge federal departments of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Since then, companies en masse have been emboldened to roll back or completely eliminate their DEI initiatives, including brands like Walmart, Amazon, and Target. On Jan. 24, days after the order, Target announced that it was concluding its three-year DEI goals and its Racial Equity Action and Change initiatives, while Amazon and Walmart dialed back their own efforts. Not only are these retailers host to a slew of BIPOC-owned brands like The Lip Bar, Fenty Beauty, and Black Girl Sunscreen, but they also have employees of all different backgrounds, from Black and Latine people to those in the LGBTQIA+ community. Since it's already been established that targeting more diverse consumers is good for business, it's disheartening to see companies make moves that directly hurt the businesses that serve them - especially as a Black woman. It's not all bad news. Amid the anti-DEI conversation, there are some brands standing firm on the commitment to equality. E.l.f. Cosmetics, for example, is one of only two publicly traded companies with an executive board of 78 percent women and 44 percent people of color. The brand recently doubled down on its inclusive \"So Many Dicks\" campaign that highlighted the gender disparity. \"There's nothing wrong with being Richard, Rick, or Dick, but we wanted to shine a light on 'let's give other people a chance' because we've seen the benefits in our own business,\" CEO Tarang Amin said in a press release. Other brands like Lush have expressed solidarity with DEI initiatives, even temporarily renaming its Thermal Waves, Sakura, and American Cream bath bombs to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. But in giving these brands their flowers, it's important to understand that their stances on DEI should be the industry standard, not a rarity. While it's gratifying to see support, minority business owners, workers, and creators are looking for these words to come to life regularly - and without an expiration date. That means putting your money where your mouth is, with diverse models, inclusive social media marketing, extensive shade ranges, and a lasting commitment to hiring (and promoting) all races and backgrounds in corporate beauty positions. I'm a Black woman in beauty, and I believe brands should be doing more - and I'm not just talking about creating \"extended\" shade ranges. (Fenty Beauty has been there, done that, and you really shouldn't expect anything less from a Black founder.) Companies should be amplifying my community, not just through a statement or social media post. What about campaigns that contain more than one Black model who's a size two and light-skinned? Or Black brands placed on every shelf rather than in just one section for the sake of Black History Month or Juneteenth? I want to see the different women in my family and friend groups shop for products that actually work for them, not ones they settle for because there are no other options. I want to be able to enter a Target beauty section or Sephora and finally see myself fully represented, not patronized. After all, according to the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility, Black women are responsible for 11.1 percent of total beauty spending, so representation is long overdue. Although the reality of brands surrendering to the call for less diversity has left many (myself included) feeling disheartened, it isn't exactly surprising. With the 2020 racial reckonings calling for more support of Black-owned businesses, many retailers took the Fifteen Percent Pledge - a commitment to dedicate 15 percent of shelf space to Black businesses. However, companies only took this stance to appease the social media backlash they were getting during that time, which means only one thing: being diverse wasn't a goal from the beginning. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mel B (@melissarbutler) The Lip Bar's founder, Melissa Butler, who has amassed major success by having Target as a stockist, shared her thoughts on Instagram in response to the recent news. \"I always thought the 2020 commitments were a farce, anything that is forced is a farce,\" she said. She also emphasized that many of the brands that launched as a result of these pledges didn't perform well, and it's a well-proven fact that money is a driving force in America. While countless pledges have been made to support smaller businesses, if corporations don't see a substantial profit, they're going to pull the plug, and it's a shame that many minority-owned companies pay the price. (We've reached out to Target for comment and will update this story when we hear back.) The point is: diversity, equity, and inclusion should not be a trend. Beauty is universal, and all skin colors, races, and backgrounds should be prioritized and valued. Although the new administration is pushing it, companies should assess their practices and not only commit but take substantive action. Achieving DEI in beauty isn't about quota fulfillment; it's about creating a safe environment where everyone can bask in their beauty without feeling forgotten or tokenized - and that shouldn't be taken away, especially at the hands of a Richard, Rick, or Dick.
