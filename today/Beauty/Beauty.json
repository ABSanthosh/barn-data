If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. When I met Jodie Turner-Smith under the MTV EMA’s red carpet lights back in November, the British-Jamaican actor, currently starring in thriller series, The Agency, was dressed in a striking royal blue, floor-length gown designed by Robert Wun, with dramatic long pointed nails and a circular wide-brimmed hat, which made her look ethereal. The Queen \u0026 Slim actor was, as many magazine and fashion police accounts confirmed at the time, one of the best-dressed celebrities of the evening. However, for me, as a long-time skincare obsessive, Jodie Turner-Smith’s skin — which gleamed in the way melanated skin does when it is highly moisturized and kissed by sunlight — played an important role in the outfit. Before I managed to point my mic in her direction, Turner-Smith already knew I was going to ask, “How? What is your skincare routine?” “This is serious,” the actor shared grinning. Without missing a beat, Turner gifted me the secrets of her rigorous and extensive shower routine with four clear achievable steps. I diligently took notes. The daily shower routine of exfoliating, oiling, airdrying, and moisturizing has now gone viral amongst Unbothered readers who also don’t play about their skin staying and looking hydrated. “This is the prime example of you can copy the recipe and not get the same sauce…cause Chile the secret is the melanin and that’s only sold by Jesus,” said one reader. True. But I was still willing to try. For the last month, I have been consistently trying Turner Smith’s routine daily to see if it would improve my skin’s texture and appearance. As someone who grew up knowing that leaving the house without lotion is a cardinal sin, I wondered how much this routine would change the appearance and feel of my skin — I already use a lot of products in and out of the shower and have a pretty solid morning and evening moisturizing ritual. Similarly, as a magazine editor, I have spent considerable time indulging in celebrity beauty and skincare and I am wary to compare my own routines and results to those with vastly more access and resources than I do. But I am not one to snub a bad-boy piece of information that is Turner-Smith’s skincare routine. I had to try it for myself. DashDividers_1_500x100 STEP 1: Exfoliating Gloves What I love about this routine is that it is relatively accessible and pretty easy for most people to recreate as far as price point. I already had many of these products in my bathroom cabinet. Having a shower is the real first step. Tick. On social media, shower routines have become a serious endeavor and I am not new to the world of “everything showers” — the internet’s favorite term for those all-encompassing showers where you buff, scrub, shave, and polish yourself until you reemerge hairless and slippery like a seal. Turner-Smith uses exfoliating gloves during the cleansing part of her shower routine — instead of just using a flannel or washcloth (depending on your preference). “You gotta put the gloves on, daily,” she emphasized. This I could get behind. I am committed to a shower tool. I use either a wash cloth or an African net sponge in the shower. For this trial, I used quite abrasive exfoliating gloves that I typically reserve for weekly exfoliating but as per Turner-Smith’s advice, for this experiment, I used them every single day for the last three weeks. I also went in with my razor afterward for an ultra-smooth result. I don’t have very sensitive skin but I did question whether using exfoliating gloves every day would be too harsh on my skin. “Your body can withstand a lot more than your face,” reassured London-based aesthetician Alicia Lartey. “So you can actually exfoliate every day. I think for some people it’s really beneficial.” Lartey explained that regular exfoliating could be beneficial for those with keratosis pilaris (the harmless skin condition that causes dry tiny bumps, often on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks or buttocks). View this post on Instagram A post shared by Unbothered (@r29unbothered) STEP 2: Almond Oil On Wet Skin Turner-Smith recommends using almond oil on wet skin. This is the key to the all-day-long shine. As one Unbothered reader responded on Instagram, “I can hear the price of almond oil rising.” I used L’Occitane’s Almond Shower Oil when in the shower which typically leaves my skin feeling soothed and smooth but I knew I would need to go in with another oil to get the red carpet glow. I had a few oils already on standby: Naturium’s Glow Getter Oil ($23.99) and Aveeno’s Skin Relief Spray ($9.55). I found Aveeno’s oil made with oats, was my favourite. Things get quite slippery “Shouldn’t it be the butter before oil? Oil is the sealant,” an Unbothered reader asked. I was also curious as I’ve long used body oil as the last step in my routine, after my lotions and/or butters — like the L.O.C method but for your skin and not for hair. Which should come first? “I personally would not use oil on wet skin unless I was doing a photo shoot,” explains Lartey. “You would want to put ingredients like ceramides, hyaluronic acid, glycerine, and all of that stuff on your skin [first]. And then you can put your creams and oils and stuff on top.” Lartey also reiterates that is really isn’t a rule and we shouldn’t be “super strict” about when to apply a product. “You can also just get body creams that have all of these oils and stuff.” STEP 3: Air Dry \u0026 Skincare  Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Turner-Smith’s shower routine is what happens after you get out of the shower, soaking wet. “I air dry, I don’t towel dry,” she told me, to my surprise, “then I do my face [while I air dry].” The thought of standing stark naked in my bathroom during a very cold British winter wasn’t fun. And, it has been below-freezing lately. But, I persisted. Standing on my bathmat in my steaming, small bathroom wasn’t quite the luxurious moment, I pictured it would be. But, getting my skincare done I found I could distract myself from my shivering. I wasn’t quite sure what air-drying covered in oil was supposed to achieve. A quick Google search suggests that air-drying helps avoid the roughness of a towel, allowing your skin, sensitive out of a hot shower, to absorb moisture. What do skin experts think? “I think air drying is actually quite ridiculous,” shares Lartey, “most people would need to get ready in some type of rush so it’s probably best if you towel dry, remember to change your towel frequently, wash it properly, then it’s all fine.” STEP 4: Shea Butter/Body Butters I learned very quickly during this process that you have to wait until you are at least 80 percent air-dry before applying lotion or else your shea butter curdles. Still, I loved the last step of Turner-Smith’s method — this is where the magic happens — and my skin looked, well, amazing. My skin was shining but not shiny and the texture was smooth and supple. I also smell incredible. “So shea butter has some occlusive properties which means that it just helps stop hydration, stops water leaving the skin so it prevents trans-epidermal water loss,” says Lartey. “If I was using shea butter I wouldn’t use an oil because it can feel quite thick.” Personally, I enjoyed the oil and shea butter combination. I used KOBA’s Get Whipped body balm $95 for my moisturizer. It’s incredibly expensive compared to other balms, however, the combination of shea butter, oils, and actives, made for a light formula, is not too sticky and thick, which seems to improve the texture of my skin. So… Did It Work? Yes. Sure the shower routine is long. But mine always have been. I’ve never truly got behind a 12-step skincare routine without a body care routine that isn’t just as thorough. Everyone has their rituals and mine has always begun in the shower. If you ask me, Black girl beauty routines have always been lengthy. If I can sit for eight hours to get my braids done, and spend an entire day washing and blow-drying my hair, I can spend an extra 20 minutes in the shower lathering myself up with various oils. I was under the illusion that I wasn’t high-maintenance, but as I applied my 8th skincare product, I knew that this wasn’t a low-lift sort of routine. I have truly enjoyed doing something that is Hollywood Actor-approved.  This article was originally published to Unbothered UK Like what you see?

    "description": "From red blush to the “cinnamon girl” aesthetic, TikTok was the driving force behind countless viral makeup trends in 2024. It was the year we ditched foundation in favor of using only concealer, embraced Eras Tour makeup, and saw the return of all things blue. That’s not to mention the hundreds of sell-out products. Refy’s Lash Sculpt and Rhode’s Pocket Blush were on everyone’s shopping lists, Rhode’s so much so that diehard fans stood in line for up to seven hours to enter the brand’s London pop-up to get their hands on one. So what can we expect from 2025? We asked some of the coolest makeup artists around to share their predictions for the upcoming year. From “cherry girl” to a continued fascination with blush, here are the most wearable makeup trends to get on board with in January and beyond. Introducing the “cherry girl” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Franny (@frannfyne) Moving on from the “tomato girl” aesthetic of 2023, and Hailey Bieber’s cinnamon roll-inspired palette that rounded out 2024, the new year will spotlight cherry — and its multiple tones — as the new hue du jour. Cherry red nails are here to stay, of course, but now it’s about lips and cheeks, too. “Cherry is versatile and wearable, ranging from bright cherry reds to deep burgundy tones,” says Chanel makeup artist Ninni Nummela. “It works beautifully as a matte [cheek] stain or a perfected lip with a juicy texture.” Take inspiration from digital creator Franny on Instagram. Hannah Murray, global artistic director at Bobbi Brown, agrees. “Cherry can be both glamorous and tough,” she says. “I think it’s an evolution of the ’90s trends we’ve seen for a while,” like latte and aubergine shades. Try combining a cherry lipstick like Merit Signature Lip in Fashion, $26, with a soft cream blush such as Refy Cream Blush in Cherry, $20, for a monochrome look. It’s all about the eyes View this post on Instagram A post shared by Clo (｡◕‿◕｡) (@chloeisabellah_) The focus for 2025 is mostly on the eyes, says Nummela, and it’s dealer’s choice how you dress them. For Nummela, it’s all about “soft washes of muted colors” in shades like baby blue and powder pink, which look especially cool swept haphazardly across the lids. That’s not all. We’ll be inspired by the spring/summer 2025 fashion shows, where we saw everything from colorful lashes, courtesy of Bottega Veneta and Dries Van Noten, to graphic liner. “The trend will lean towards easy-to-achieve, minimalist lines like a single, clean swipe of liner along the upper lash line, extended into a soft wing or a geometric shape [at the outer corner],” says Simone Otis, makeup artist for 19/99 Beauty. Try ONE/SIZE by Patrick Starrr Point Made Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner Pen, $26, with a felt-tip nib that makes light work of wings, and look to Chloe Isabellah for inspiration. Balance out bold liner with a black or brown mascara like Benefit Cosmetics Fan Fest Fanning \u0026 Volumizing Mascara, $39, or experiment with at-home extensions. Isamaya Ffrench’s collaboration with Lashify will help you achieve your dream lashes. The new no-makeup makeup View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rachael Alisedaghat (@rachaela_) There’s a new take on the no-makeup makeup trend most weeks but this year’s iteration presents something fresh: a more matte and blurred approach to skin, as opposed to an obvious glow. “This is more of a soft-focus effect with a sophisticated, velvety finish,” explains Nummela. “[Think] less shine and more subtle luminosity,” as seen on digital fashion, beauty and lifestyle creator Rachael Alisedaghat. Rather than enlisting shimmer-laden powder highlighter, the effect is achieved by strategically applying balm textures to the high points of the face, like cheekbones and the bridge of the nose, for a naturally radiant touch. For that perfect, “in-between” soft skin look, mix a little Saie Glowy Super Gel, $28, with Chanel Ultra Le Teint Velvet, $55, and apply all over. Blurred and bitten lips View this post on Instagram A post shared by NESSA (@vanessawhite) Speaking of blurred beauty, your new go-to lip will be all about undefined edges and a just-bitten look. At Carolina Herrera, lightly glossed plum lip stains took centre stage, while at Grace Ling, lips were dressed in an understated nude, blurred at the edges. But there’s more of a just-kissed feel in 2025. “[The new blurred lips] fit perfectly into the ongoing movement towards low-maintenance beauty while allowing for playful experimentation with color,” Otis says. “Whether you’re after a soft wash of color or a bold bitten lip, this look is all about embracing effortless beauty.” She recommends choosing your favorite lip stain (try Victoria Beckham Beauty Bitten Lip Tint in Cherie, $34, or Milk Makeup Cooling Water Jelly Tint in Splash, $24) and dabbing the product onto the centre of your lips using your finger or a lip brush. “[To blur] use your finger or a cotton [bud] to gently blend the color outwards, softening the edges so they fade into your natural lip line,” says Otis. Grungy greige View this post on Instagram A post shared by KATIE JANE HUGHES (@katiejanehughes) This year, Murray suggests that grey-meets-beige, aka greige, will be the new neutral. “[At fashion week] Rick Owens, Marni and Roksanda embraced all things greige, coloring the lips and eyes in this flattering, cool-toned neutral,” she says. It’s ideal for those who want to embrace the grunge aesthetic with a chic and modern twist. The easiest way to wear it is on your eyes à la makeup artist Katie Jane Hughes. Try Bobbi Brown Long-Wear Cream Shadow Stick in Stone, $34, or RMS Eyelights Cream Eyeshadow, $28, which offers more of a shimmery take. This looks super pretty with a neutral lipstick and NARS has an excellent selection for all skin tones. The return of shimmer View this post on Instagram A post shared by Alexandra French (@alexandraafrench) No longer the preserve of the ’00s, shimmer is set to make a comeback in 2025. This time around, it’s all grown up. Think tiny pops of metallic and subtle shimmer accents on eyes and atop cheekbones. At Alice + Olivia spring/summer 2025, hints of shimmer were placed at the inner corners and concentrated to the middle of the lids to brighten up eyes. Take a cue from makeup artist Alexandra French. “For 2025, the shimmer is more refined: delicate, pearlescent tones rather than chunky glitter,” explains Aimee Connolly, makeup artist and founder of Sculpted By Aimee. It’s pretty easy to achieve, adds Jorge Balzaretti, senior makeup artist for SUQQU. “You don’t need much to make an impact. Just a swipe of shimmer on your lids or a little dab of highlighter on your cheekbones instantly takes your look from everyday to effortlessly glowing.” For the most impressive shimmering eyes, there’s no brand better than Half Magic. Its Chromaddiction Shimmer Eye Paint \u0026 Liner, $25.50, offers dramatic yet refined sparkle in a number of beautiful colors. Modern blush View this post on Instagram A post shared by MYLA (@pradaolic) Thanks to brands like Rhode and Milk Makeup, blush had a main character moment in 2024 — and it’ll continue its reign in the new year. But pink could be out. Instead, natural red and burgundy tints (as seen on Myla aka @pradaolic on Instagram) as well as fall-inspired brown (yes, brown) will see us reinvent a natural-looking flush that works across all skin tones. “I love the sun-kissed look that you can get from using warmer blush tones, and I think this [year], the shift is in the placement, bringing the color higher up on the apples of the cheeks to almost under the eyes where you would naturally catch the sun,” says Murray. Balzaretti thinks that 2025 is going to push things even further color-wise. “I’m loving the rise of experimental shades like mauve and rust,” he says. “These colors add such beautiful depth and warmth to the skin without feeling too traditional.” After a warmer hue? Try Rhode Pocket Blush in Sleepy Girl, $24, or the viral Huda Beauty Icy Nude Blush Filter in Latte, $21. Above, Myla wears Milk Makeup Cooling Water Jelly Tint in Splash, $22. Like what you see?

    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Renee Rodriguez/ Product Image: Amazon / Photo Illustration: Aly Lim TikTok has no shortage of makeup and hair hacks for consumption, especially when it comes to claw clips. As someone who frequently scrolls the platform for beauty tips, I'm sure it comes as no surprise that I've already mastered the double-bun claw-clip hack, the half-up, half-down bun claw-clip hack, and the viral claw-clip hack for layered hair. I thought I had tested all the claw-clip hacks the app had to offer, but it turns out there was another hiding right under my nose that might just be my favorite yet. Officially named the \"flip and claw clip\" ponytail, I've seen a lot of influencers testing out the trend, but it was TikTok user Emilie Kiser's video that influenced me to test it out for myself. In the clip, which has 9.3 million views and counting, Kiser pulls her long blond hair into a slicked-back ponytail but adds tons of volume with the addition of the claw clip. The outcome looks like a full-on Ariana Grande ponytail, and I absolutely wanted to re-create the look for myself. @emiliekiser WHAT DO WE THINK?! I love it💗🫶🏼🧡✨ #hairtok #easyhairstyles #viralhairstyles #cleangirl #cleangirlaesthetic #trending #viral #dayinmylife #grwm #schoolhairstyles #viralponytail #clawcliphairstyles #amazonfinds #amazon #thatgirl #healthyhair #hairhack #longhair #hairinspo ♬ original sound - ALTÉGO Whenever I wear claw clips in my hair, I typically wear a faux french twist, and when I wear a ponytail, I don't do anything fancy other than wrap an elastic around my hair three times. I was interested to see whether the results would work on my hair, which isn't nearly as long or as thick as Kiser's. To test out the hack for myself, all I needed was my favorite claw clip and a hair tie. As previously mentioned, my hair is on the thin side, so I opted for the Goody Ouchless Hair Ties For Fine to Medium Hair ($8) rather than regular-size hair ties. Image Source: PS Photography / Renee Rodriguez I started by combing through my hair and making sure there were no knots or snags, and I also added in a few drops of hair oil to give me some shine. One thing all of the people in the tutorials I watched had in common was long, luscious hair, but mine is frizzy and fine, so I wanted to make sure I was giving it the proper treatment before I began. Then, I pulled my hair into a ponytail situated at the middle of my head and secured it with an elastic. From there, I made a hole in the upper half of the pony using my fingers, then I flipped the bottom half of the pony through the hole. To finish everything off, I placed the claw clip underneath at the base of my ponytail so my hair cascaded over the top. Although it sounds a bit complicated, it's easy to get the hang of once you watch the video. The end result looked even better than I thought it would - a voluminous ponytail with absolutely zero drooping. Also, the style lasted all day long without the need for touch-ups, which is a major plus for me because I'm always on the go. Image Source: PS Photography / Renee Rodriguez One important thing to note: after watching videos and testing it for myself, I've come to the conclusion that this ponytail hack looks the best on those with long and thick hair. It worked well on my medium-length fine hair as well, but if I wanted to see some extra fullness in the future, I would consider adding a few hair extensions to my pony.

    "description": "When it comes to choosing the tattoo placement for your next design, there are some areas that are naturally sexier than others. Your sternum, for example, can feel more sultry than your right bicep. Still, of all the locations, the best place has to be on your booty. That's right, sexy butt tattoos are back. So if you've been considering getting butt tattoos, you've come to the right place. You wouldn't be the only one interested in this particular tattoo trend: Halsey, Cardi B, and Teyana Taylor are among the many celebrities who've decided to embellish their bums with cheeky designs (yes, pun intended) - and it's easy to see why. For one, because it's in a relatively hidden spot that not everyone will get to see. This makes the tattoo your (and anyone else you choose to show) little secret. Not to mention, the sex appeal of a tattoo is generally in its placement; the right design may end up being the best permanent reminder of just how hot you truly are. Whether you're thinking of adorning your backside with a subtle and tiny design or turning your entire butt into a hyperrealistic work of art, we've rounded up a ton of inspiration that proves a butt tattoo can also be tasteful. To check out more bum tattoo ideas, keep scrolling. Related: What to Wear to a Tattoo Appointment: Side, Back, Butt, Chest, and Hip",
