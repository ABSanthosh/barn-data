    "description": "They say that winter is the most magical time of the year, though I'd have to argue differently. Besides slippery sidewalks and static hair, there's chapped lips, Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), crowded subway stations, and coming to terms with how bad you are at wrapping presents.But peel back all the heavy layers that make you sweat through your commute and take a moment to unwind, and maybe you'll start to feel some semblance of the cozy, festive vibes all those holiday movies promised. And if you ask us, reaching for the right fragrance definitely helps.From Maison Francis Kurkdjian to Kayali, the biggest fragrance houses have been busy whipping up perfumes that feel like the comforting hug we've been yearning for all season — and whether you can't get enough of cozy vanilla notes or cool winter florals are more your thing, there's something to suit every budget.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.For more can't-miss shopping stories delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our Most Wanted newsletter.Kayali Yum Boujee Marshmallow 81 Eau de Parfum Intense“A perfume with this name is a far cry from the musky, spicy scents I typically gravitate to. However, Kayali previously won me over with another sweet concoction, Burning Cherry, so I was intrigued to try this latest offering. Yum Boujee Marshmallow creates a first impression that’s nothing like its name. The scent is bright, zesty, and decidedly fruity and floral, relying heavily on its top notes of freesia, lemon, and apple. It’s almost a bit too intense for my nose, but, luckily, it has a gorgeous dry down. It’s warm and musky at the base, balanced with hints of sweetness that's really wearable. This is where it lives up to its marshmallow name, aided by notes of whipped cream and vanilla. This new launch reminds of the sweet body sprays from my teens, but a lot more elegant and refined (and a lot less cloying). I can still smell it on my clothes at the end of the day.” — Esther Newman, affiliate writerShop SephoraKayali Yum Boujee Marshmallow 81 Eau de Parfum Intense, $, available at SephoraD.S. \u0026 Durga Big Sur Eucalyptus Eau de Parfum“I’ve been sharing Big Sur Eucalyptus with my partner; it’s the ultimate genderless fragrance. Initially, it’s a burst of fresh, woody, green crunchiness thanks to eucalyptus, rosemary and wet wood, but as it settles into the skin, it takes on a warm and spicy feel with hints of cardamom and dry leaves. It’s the perfect balance between a breath of crisp winter air and cozying up in an oversized hoodie. I love the chic bottle, too, which takes pride of place on my bedside cabinet.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty directorShop NordstromD.S. \u0026 Durga Big Sur Eucalyptus Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromZara Shades Of Lust Eau de Parfum“This was my first time trying a Zara fragrance, and I have to say that I’m pleasantly surprised. Not only does Shades Of Lust come in an intricate glass bottle that looks way more expensive than it actually is (and bears a striking resemblance to Guerlain perfumes), the longevity and projection are both incredible for the $23 price tag. Just one spray on my wrists fills my nose — and my immediate surroundings — with a delicious aroma of white peach and orange blossom, which takes a good few hours to fade. Anyone who likes fruity floral scents will be absolutely on board, especially if you’re already a fan of peach-centered perfumes like Parfums de Marly Valaya or Kilian Paris Good Girl Gone Bad.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop ZaraZara Shades Of Lust Eau de Parfum, $, available at ZaraJo Malone Fir \u0026 Artemisia Cologne“To my nose, this perfume doesn’t lean feminine or masculine. The woodsy note of fir tree is the star here, and there’s a quiet dash of something minty and bitter in the background. I don’t normally love patchouli as I find it too masculine for my taste, but here it’s subtle. This scent reminds me of the holiday in that it’s warm, but not spicy. Don’t expect robust staying power, but I think that works perfectly here. It stays close to the skin, making it quite an intimate and cozy scent. If this did have intense projection, it would be too overbearing (off-putting, even). All in all, this scent reminds me of hugging someone you love while wearing a thick sweater.” — Tanyel Mustafa, senior writerShop Blue MercuryJo Malone Fir \u0026 Artemisia Cologne, $, available at Blue MercuryMerit Retrospect L'Extrait de Parfum“Upon first sniff, Retrospect does give the impression of a grandma scent, but hear me out: it’s chic,like you’ve just discovered her vintage Chanel jacket hiding in the back of the closet, and her perfume is still clinging to the fabric. It’s familiar and comforting. The pear top note hits you first, and while that initial blast is strong, it dries down and begins to smell more unique and skin-like. This is where it starts to shine. The florals (jasmine, orris, and rose) peek through, and aldehydes cut them with a sharp, clean zing. The notes of musk, jasmine, and moss then linger for hours, wrapping you in a warm, nostalgic hug. I love to wear this with knits — there’s just something so soothing about it on a chilly winter’s day.” — Humeara Mohamed, Contributing WriterShop MeritMerit Retrospect L’Extrait de Parfum, $, available at MeritMaison Francis Kurkdjian APOM Eau de Parfum“APOM, which stands for 'A Part of Me’, is the perfume I’ve been turning to whenever the winter blues have been getting to me. I like to think of it as a bottled up ray of sunshine that feels surprisingly appropriate for cold and gloomy days. The main characters are ylang-ylang and neroli, which are both notes that bring back some of my happiest memories traveling through Southeast Asia (as these types of scents are heavily featured in spa products out there). The two florals are elevated by orange blossom, which creates a scent profile that’s much more sophisticated than your average floral perfume. Notes of amber and white musk further ground the scent, making it a more warm and nostalgic experience. This perfume has The White Lotus season three (which just so happens to be set in Thailand) written all over it, and I’ve been reaching for my bottle whenever I need to channel my inner rich auntie.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop NordstromMaison Francis Kurkdjian APOM Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromBDK Parfums Rouge Smoking Eau de Parfum“From Kayali Burning Cherry to Zara Cherry Smoothie, I have an obsession with cherry perfumes. They’re often tart and syrupy in equal measure and therefore a lot more nuanced than your typical fruity fragrances, which can be overly saccharine. At first spritz, BDK’s Rouge Smoking is quite similar to Kayali’s offering, thanks to notes of cherry, almondy heliotrope flower and zingy bergamot, but the dry down is where it stands out and triumphs. It becomes clean and comforting (that’ll be the white musk, vanilla and cashmere wood) and I’ve never known a fragrance to cling to the skin and clothes quite like it. The staying power is incredible. It’s a sexy cherry scent for grown ups that transcends seasons but works particularly well in winter. I always look forward to spritzing it.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty directorShop Neiman MarcusBDK Parfums Rouge Smoking Eau de Parfum, $, available at Neiman MarcusChanel No.5 Limited-Edition Eau de Parfum“Despite the influx of tourists around the holiday season, I do appreciate seeing all the festive decorations around London. One of my favorite strolls has been via New Bond Street, which is currently decked out with glorious Christmas lights shaped like Chanel No.5 bottles. I’ve definitely developed a stronger love for this classic perfume since entering my 30s, especially with how the sharp and piercing aldehydes interact with my body chemistry to create a luxurious, soapy scent that doesn’t smell like anything else. For the holiday season, Chanel has released a special edition of No.5, featuring a bottle draped in handwoven silk to create a ‘snowfall’ effect. The fairytale packaging makes this an even more worthy collector’s item, if you ask me.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop ChanelChanel No.5 Limited-Edition Eau de Parfum, $, available at ChanelJo Loves Black Cashmeran and Tonka Parfum“This would make the perfect addition to any winter perfume wardrobe. With spicy cardamom, a heavy helping of ginger and a dash of rum, it’s like a warming masala chai with a slab of dark chocolate on the side — rich but never bitter thanks to vanilla-esque tonka bean, which lends a subtle sweetness. Whenever I wear this, I feel so powerful.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty directorShop Jo LovesJo Loves Black Cashmeran and Tonka Parfum, $, available at Jo LovesLike what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. It’s been a comeback year for hair accessories — but forget your trusty claw clip and shelve the chunky Alice band for a moment. It’s the humble bow that is currently taking over Instagram feeds and flooding TikTok hair tutorials. Of course, bows and ribbons are nothing new; they’ve adorned our hair for centuries. From the last queen of France, Marie Antoinette, whose hairdresser is said to have spent 20,000 francs on ribbons, to young women in the Victorian era, coquettish hair bows have proven enduringly popular. You know what they say, though: All beauty trends come full circle. Samantha Cusick, hairstylist, podcast host and owner of her eponymous London salon chain, puts this 21st century resurgence down to Gossip Girl character Blair Waldorf, not to mention the rise of the ‘quiet luxury’ aesthetic. “Using bows is the easiest way to look like you tried, without actually trying,” she says. It’s effortless. If you’re keen to try the trend but don’t know where to start, let TikTok’s beauty enthusiasts guide you. Here’s how to style the playful bow on all hair. How to style a bow on long hair @kylei.ann gaslighting myself into loving styling my hair #airwrap #hairbow #easyhairstyles #finehair #thinhairhairstyle ♬ original sound – kylei halbakken If your hair is on the straight side, make like TikToker Kylei Halbakken and give it a little texture and movement with a curling iron or hot tool. Halbakken uses the Dyson Airwrap, $599, to create tousles, but if you’d rather spend less, try the Shark FlexStyle Air Styling \u0026 Drying System, $249.99, or BaByliss Air Style 1000 Hot Air Multi Styler, $88. Run a brush through your lengths to loosen the curls into soft waves and pull a little hair oil through the mid-lengths and ends to add shine. Halbakken enlists Gisou Honey Infused Hair Oil, $46, but you can also try OGX Renewing+ Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil, $10.69. A half-up, half-down style is the easiest way to wear a bow on long lengths. Starting at your temples, use the tail end of a comb to gather half of your hair into a ponytail and fix in place with a small hair elastic, which will make tying your bow less of a chore. Halbakken ties a long piece of ribbon around the elastic, but you could fasten a bow-adorned barrette through the top section of your hair, just above the hair elastic.  If this style looks too princessy for you, then hair stylist Chlöe Swift Bow recommends teasing your roots to create a long and voluminous Brigitte Bardot-inspired pony, finishing with a ribbon or bow scrunchie tied around the base. How to style a bow on layered hair  @sanjureddyyyy bow hairstyles🎀 #bowhairstyles #easyhairstyletutorials #bowhairtutorial #mediumlengthhairstyles #hairstyleideasforyou #grwmhair #hairstyles ♬ original sound – EX7STENCE™ Take inspiration from TikToker Sanjana and section off the front of your hair on either side, so that it frames your face. Moving further inwards, Sanjana fashions a delicate braid on both sides, leaving around two inches of hair free at the end. Secure your plait with a hair elastic, like Kitsch No-Snag Clear Elastics, $3. Now for the ribbon, which you can find on Etsy or at your local craft store. The key is making sure it’s long enough to tie easily. Cut off a piece that is around seven inches long to begin with — you can always trim the ends to suit your preferences. Simply tie the ribbon around each hair elastic and pull tight so that it doesn’t unravel. A veil of strong-hold hairspray over the bow will keep it in place for longer.  How to style a bow on short hair @kylaleelee day 8 of the 10 days of short hairstyles series 💝 super easy \u0026 cutesy! #shorthairstyles #shorthair #easyhairstyles #bowhairstyles #shorthairstyleideas #hairinspo #shorthairinspo #shorthaircut #quickhairstyles #10daysofhairstyles #shorthaircut ♬ som original – chica TikToker Kyla Lee is proof that a hair bow looks just as good on a bob haircut. If you have face-framing bangs like Lee, give it some bounce with a roller, like Drybar High Tops Self-Grip Rollers, $12. Lee gathers small sections of their hair from either side, twists them and then ties them together at the back using a hair elastic. Finally, you’ll need a bow clip with a barrette fastening. Lee passes the open barrette clip just underneath the hair elastic and pins it into place. A chunky bow will complement a shorter cut like this. How to style a bow on natural hair @mochasburner Another day, another cute holiday hairstyle 🎀 #lowbun #sleeklowbun #slickbun #hairbows #bowhairclips #bowhairstyles #hairbowdiy #4chairtutorials #type4a4b #fallhairstyleideas #winterhairtrends #christmashairbow #blackgirlhairtutorial ♬ La belle vie – Sacha Distel Using Aunt Jackie’s Don’t Shrink Flaxseed Curling Gel, $8.99, hair and lifestyle TikToker, Mocha, creates two small braids on either side and plaits the remainder of their hair at the back, then secures this into a low bun. Enlist both a hair tie and bobby pins to keep it tight. You could tie a ribbon around the low bun, but a bow with a barrette clip or scrunchie requires less effort. Fasten yours just above the bun so that the bow tails tumble down over it.  How to style a bow on curly hair @curlyhairstylesandtips #curls #curlytiktok #curlyhairstyles #bowhairstyle #curlmagic #naturalcurls #curlyhairtutorial #curlyhairstyle #bowhairclips #cutehairstyles #easyhairstyles ♬ original sound – Curlswithlove “It’s all about letting the texture do its thing,” says Cusick. Look to TikToker @curlswithlove for inspiration, who makes a case for letting her natural curls shine in a half-up-half-down style. Use your thumbs to gather approximately half of your hair up, so that it resembles a ponytail. You can tie this up using a hair tie or hold this section in place with one hand and pass your barrette clip bow underneath with the other. Pull out some curly tendrils to frame your face and dial up the coquette effect.  @itsmikaylanicolee Hair Inspo 01| Pigtails with Ribbons🎀🫶🏽 #hairinspo #hairbowtutorial #fallhairstyles #curls ♬ Last Christmas (Pudding Mix) – Wham! If your hair is long, take cue from TikToker Mikayla Nicole: Part your hair in the middle, section the front into two ponytails, fix with a hair tie and grace with a bow on each side.  How to style a bow on medium-length hair @adelialaughs The bows 🎀🎀 #mediumhairstyles #slickbackhairstyle #bowhairstyle ♬ original sound – 𝑵𝑨𝑻𝑪𝑺𝑳𝑼𝑽𝑹❦ Mid-length haircuts are far from boring — but they’re even better with a bow. After a generous helping of hair cream (try Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream, $36, or Lee Stafford Grow Strong \u0026 Long Protein Treatment Styling Cream, $14.59), TikToker Adelia whips their hair up into a high ponytail, fashions a chunky braid and ties a short, black ribbon around the base and end for a look that’s sophisticated and playful in equal measure. If you think you might struggle to knot the perfect bow, use a bow-adorned hair tie to make this style easier to recreate at home.

Passing that big, bold barrette bow clip through your hair just above the base of the ponytail is the cherry on top.  How to style a bow on fine hair @alyssarayelee Step by step for this viral bow hairstyle!! #shorthairstyles #finehairstyles #hairstyleinspo #hairhack #hairtrends ♬ Maria Maria (feat. The Product G\u0026B) (sped up) – Santana \u0026 sped up + slowed TikToker Alyssa has a hack for styling fine hair. Using a fine tooth comb like Maison Pearson Tail Comb, $34, take a section of hair from the front and rake it back, then fasten in the middle with a clear hair elastic. Using your fingers, hollow out a section at the base, just above the elastic and loop the ends through the space. Repeat on the other side. This should create the illusion of four sections of hair. All you need now is a long ribbon to pass through the gaps and tie into a bow. If you find your hair is too fine and slippery to hold a bow, Chlöe suggests adding texture and grip with a dry shampoo or texture spray, like ARKIVE Headcare The Reset Dry Shampoo, $13.50, or Living Proof Full Dry Volume \u0026 Texture Spray, $24.61.   Like what you see?

    "description": "Experimenting with your hair color can be a fun way to change up your look or get through a stifled style period. (Finding the specific shade you want can also be a source of stress, but once you land on a decision you're happy with, it's pretty close to the best feeling.) While it's often much cheaper than shelling out for a new wardrobe, coloring your hair is still an investment, and you want to make sure it lasts as long as possible, which means knowing when to wash your hair after coloring, and if you should wash your hair before dyeing it. Proper maintenance is the number one way to ensure your color stays looking fresh, so it's important to know which color-safe products to buy, how often to go in for touch-ups, and the rules of washing your hair to prevent fading. That's right, washing your hair is often framed as a key cause of fading color, but as it turns out, the answer to your burning question, \"When can I wash my hair after dyeing it?\" is less about when and more about how. To help explain, we asked a colorist for everything you need to know. Experts Featured in This Article Sydney Palmer is a hair-color specialist at Estetica Salon \u0026 Spa in St. Paul, MN. Jade Kromer is a hair-color specialist at Juut Salon Spa in Minneapolis. How Long to Wait to Wash Hair After Coloring \"Lots of people believe that the color needs to set in your hair for a few days after coloring - that's actually just a myth,\" hair-color specialist Sydney Palmer tells PS. \"The hair color doesn't set in any more than it already has if you wait to wash it.\" So if you've ever wondered, \"Can I wash my hair 24 hours after dyeing it?\" you have your answer, once and for all. Hair-color specialist Jade Kromer adds that you can wash your hair as soon as you need to (although you likely won't need to that day if you're coming fresh from the salon). \"Washing your hair right after you color it really isn't the problem,\" she says. \"Focus more on what products you're using rather than time in between shampoos.\" You might be wondering, why do salons wash your hair after coloring? The answer is simple: they want to make sure all the dye is out of your hair before getting you styled. They might even double-wash your hair: once to get rid of the dye, and a second time to fully cleanse your hair. Why Is My Color Fading? When it comes to hair dye, it's much more important to prevent the dye from leaching out than it is to let it \"set\" in your hair initially. Each strand of hair is surrounded by the cuticle, which is what traps the color in. When you wash your hair, particularly in hot water, you risk opening up the cuticle and letting the color bleed out. Palmer recommended washing colored hair in cooler water: \"That makes your hair cuticle stay closed and keeps your hair color trapped inside the strands of hair. Warm water makes the cuticle more likely to open and let the color out, which is why color fades so fast.\" Then comes the question of how to keep your hair color vibrant. If a cold shower doesn't sound appealing to you, you can also wash your hair less frequently and try to avoid water that's steaming hot. If you choose what's known as a \"fashion color\" for your hair, such as bright pink, orange, or purple, Kromer recommends washing just once a week and using dry shampoo in the meantime, like the Divi Dry Shampoo Spray ($20, originally $26). These colors typically require bleaching the hair, which can make cuticles more porous and, therefore, more likely to leak color in the shower. If you just have highlights or lowlights instead of full hair color, you can be a little more lax about water temperature, Palmer says. Less pigment in the hair means that the temperature of the water matters less. In addition to how frequently you wash your hair and the temperature, what you wash it with can make a big difference in how long your color lasts. \"The type of shampoo, conditioner, and products you use at home are the ultimate reason why your color is going to last or fade,\" Kromer says. \"Drugstore shampoos may feel like they're getting your hair and scalp really clean, but they can have chemicals in them that are linked to fading of professional hair color. If you invest in your products, you'll realize how much more life you'll get from your color.\" Some drugstore brands of shampoo and conditioner can contain synthetic ingredients like sulfates, parabens, silicone, and other ingredients that can strip the hair of its color. When you invest in high-quality hair care, you're investing in your hair color and overall hair health. Palmer also recommends watching out for clarifying shampoos, which are \"great for getting your scalp clean, but more likely to strip hair of its color.\" As such, it's best to use those sparingly. Should You Wash Your Hair Before Dyeing It? The short answer: \"Yes, but there's really no need,\" Palmer says. Your colorist will have done that for you. If you head straight from the salon to the gym and need to wash your hair afterward, don't fret - just use cooler water and quality products for your hair type. Palmer recommended washing no more than three times per week with cooler water and the right products. Another tip for avoiding dullness is to regularly use a hair-color mask like the Olaplex No. 8 Bond Intense Moisture Hair Mask ($30) or Shu Uemura's Color Lustre Treatment Mask for Color Treated Hair ($73). Do You Need Shampoo to Rinse Out Hair Dye? If you're dyeing your hair at home, when it's time to rinse it out, simply use cold water. You should continue rinsing your hair until the water runs completely clear, which signifies that all the dye has been washed out. From there, feel free to shampoo with your typical product and then follow up with a conditioner. Some manufacturers' instructions require forgoing shampoo after dyeing your hair, so make sure to read the instructions on the product you're using.

    "description": "Oh to bottle up the way Sabrina Carpenter's \"Espresso\" made me feel this summer. The radio domination! The endless memes! Me neurotically murmuring the track's nonsense chorus all day: \"That's that me espresso.\" (I'm still trying to unpack whatever that line means.) Alas, as summer 2024's unofficial anthem, not only did the ballad top my Spotify Wrapped reports, it also accompanied some of my fondest memories of the year. And as 2024 comes to a close, Carpenter is helping nostalgia-starved fans tap into memories inspired by the hit song with a perfume that pays homage to its caffeine-infused roots. Scent Beauty's Me Espresso Eau de Parfum ($60) is the latest in a long line of fragrance collaborations between the pop star and perfume brand, though I'd argue this launch might be their most decadent to date. Much like her \"Espresso\" song, Carpenter's Espresso Perfume plays into a sweet yet sultry vibe, with rich notes like cocoa powder and espresso bean that are so evocative, they'll have you feeling like you were steeped in a pool of Italian dark roast. Ahead, I break down what this new Sabrina Carpenter perfume smells like, how it compares to other celebrity fragrances, and why the mocha mousse color trend might hint at it being 2025's hottest scent. About Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso Perfume This perfume features notes of espresso bean, cocoa powder, vanilla orchid, sugared amber, and jasmine, among others. It's available in one 2.5 ounce size. The perfume is one of several that have been created through Sabrina Carpenter's partnership with Scent Beauty; others include a Sweet Tooth Cherry Baby Perfume and Sweet Tooth Caramel Perfume. What I Like About Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso Perfume Given that my fragrance preferences tend to lean toward notes like smoky vanilla or sandalwood, I was admittedly skeptical before trying this Scent Beauty perfume. I've always found that caffeine- or food-scented fragrances bordered between being delicious and downright tacky; hence why I was so surprised to find that this pop star-approved perfume smells... rather delightful. While it's infused with decadent notes like cocoa powder and espresso bean, the scent is heavy on its jasmine fragrance (a welcome surprirse) while lighter fragrances like vanilla and amber help to balance the aroma out. Carpenter's perfume is sweet without being overwhelming, with a balminess that reminds me of a powdery, brown-sugar latte as opposed to a stark espresso scent. While I'm less of an expert on fragrance-layering, other shoppers - namely reviewers on Scent Beauty's site - also claim that it's a fantastic perfume to layer with other scents. One user even wrote: \"I love wearing it by itself but I sprayed a lavender vanilla body spray on top and it was heavenly! Like a vanilla lavender latte!\" Another thing that I really appreciate about this espresso perfume is its long-lasting scent. A little goes a long way: I usually only need a spritz or two on my wrists and neck in order to really lock in the fragrance, then I'm good for the rest of the day. I've also received endless compliments since I started wearing the perfume, many coming hours after I first sprayed it - another testament to its longevity. Plus, with the mocha mousse color trend predicted to dominate 2025, I'm convinced this espresso perfume might wind up being the year's hottest fragrance. What to Consider Before Trying Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso Perfume As far as celebrity perfumes go, this fragrance is pricier than some other market options (for example, Ariana Grande's Cloud Perfume and Kylie Jenner's Kylie Fragrance retail for about $48). But based off of its unique scent and long-lasting smell, I'd say that it's worth the price. If you're in the market for something more affordable, you can shop out other celebrity perfumes or fragrances with similar espresso scents. Where Is Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso Perfume Available? This celebrity perfume is available to shop at Scent Beauty.
