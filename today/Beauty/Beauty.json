If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. A personal trainer friend of mine has a mantra that she’ll never let me forget: “Anything is possible when you’re hydrated.” Consider me indolent, then, because my daily water intake is pretty shocking. I’ll take a big mug of tea over a glass of the clear stuff any day, and while that certainly keeps my tastebuds happy, I can imagine that my skin is less than impressed. In fact, I know that to be true. Besides obvious dehydration, the cold weather and central heating has zapped my skin of moisture. As such, I’ve navigated a persistent flaky forehead and noticed a handful of superficial lines cropping up underneath my eyes in the past few months. What does dehydrated skin look like? Don’t get me wrong. Skin texture is entirely normal and a totally usual part of aging (I just turned 32, in case you were wondering). But I know I’m not the only one to suspect that something else is up. “What does dehydrated skin look like” and “signs of dehydrated skin” are both commonly googled skincare queries.  While those new faint lines are somewhat self-inflicted, a recent appointment with a dermatologist taught me something new: Increasing your water intake can only do so much to minimize skin texture, dryness, dullness and the uncomfortable tight feeling. Rather, it’s what you put on your face that counts. Popular hydrating ingredients in topical skincare products include hyaluronic acid, which famously holds 1,000 times its weight in water, and polyglutamic acid, said to be even more hydrating than that. But another skincare ingredient has caught my eye lately, not least because it seems to promise a lot more. Enter: ectoin. What is ectoin and what are the skincare benefits? While it’s not entirely new, skincare brands are only just beginning to incorporate ectoin (pronounced ec-toe-in) into their serums and moisturizers. That now includes The Inkey List, which today launches its Ectoin Hydro-Barrier Serum, $15 — a product I had the privilege of trying before anyone else. The Inkey List Ectoin Hydro-Barrier Serum, $15 If you’re an R29 regular, you’ll know that I’m a big fan of The Inkey List, in particular its transformative Bio-Active Ceramide Moisturizer, $20, so I was excited to add the serum to my skincare rotation. But before I get into the nitty-gritty, a little science. Dr. Nava Greenfield, a New York-based, board-certified dermatologist with Schweiger Dermatology Group, says ectoin is part of a protein structure that comes from molecules found in certain bacteria which live in high-stress environments. “[Ectoin] protects the bacteria from the environmental stressors,” she says, “and it can help protect human cells in the skin barrier [the outermost layer of skin] by attracting numerous water molecules and creating an effective physical film layer.”  This film layer essentially traps water and prevents water loss; no dry, rough skin here. Dr. Greenfield adds that this helps strengthen the skin and its natural barrier function, which keeps in the good stuff (think moisture) and defends against the bad stuff (like bacteria). “In turn, it can create visible results when used in skincare,” she says.  Besides 2% ectoin, this serum also boasts 2.5% hyaluronic acid, 1% ceramide NP (a substance that occurs naturally in the skin and works like glue to keep skin cells intact) and 1% oat, which a handful of studies suggest alleviates dry and irritated skin. You’d think the texture would be thick or sticky but it’s the opposite: lightweight yet substantially moisturizing, and it absorbs in seconds. I knew that it would replace most of my skincare after the very first application. An honest review of The Inkey List’s Ectoin Hydro-Barrier Serum Unlike retinol, which takes weeks to yield results, ectoin and hyaluronic acid work almost instantly to boost hydration in the skin. (I like to apply this serum to a slightly damp face to maximize moisture.) You know the feeling that your face might crack into a hundred tiny pieces when you cleanse and don’t apply skincare immediately? I’m convinced that using this serum has mitigated that. It makes sense: The Inkey List reports that, when combined, ectoin and hyaluronic acid can hydrate the skin up to 10 surface layers deep. Most mornings I apply two pumps to freshly cleansed skin and follow with a high factor, broad spectrum sunscreen — no need for a moisturizer. In the evening, I double cleanse, apply the serum and follow with the aforementioned ceramide face cream. Super simple. While my 2025 New Year’s resolution is not to stand too close to the bathroom mirror, I can’t help but notice how those fine lines underneath my eyes — and the less deep ones on my forehead — have almost entirely filled out. It’s more obvious to me when I wear makeup because it no longer collects there. The flakes on my forehead have all but disappeared, too, and the serum does a better job of moisturizing my lips than any dedicated lip balm I own. Most notably, though, my skin is so much clearer. I think I know why: A dermatologist once told me that when skin is dehydrated, it won’t produce more water but it can produce more oil to compensate. Oil and dead skin cells are a recipe for breakouts, but seeing as my skin seems to be making less of the stuff while using this serum, it’s perhaps not as prone to clogged pores.  They say that the best skincare products are the ones you enjoy using. I look forward to applying this every morning and evening because it feels like a comfort blanket for my otherwise tight, parched skin. At $15, it’s the cheapest product in my skincare routine currently, but if you ask me — and the dermatologists who sing ectoin’s praises — it’s arguably the most hardworking for dry, dehydrated skin.  Just like the brand’s ceramide moisturizer, I have a feeling that Hydro-Barrier is going to become a staple in my skincare routine this winter and beyond.

    "description": "The year might not be over just yet but with my New Year’s Eve nails all booked, I’m looking ahead to 2025 to collect ideas for my January manicure. And while 2024 has more than delivered on amazing trends to take inspiration from (I’m talking glass nails, chrome manicures and fresh takes on French tips), I’m glad to report that next year looks even better when it comes to incredible nail looks. Whether you’re into a minimalist manicure or bedazzled nail art with all the trimmings, 2025 looks set to deliver on color, texture and nail health. But don’t take my word for it. I caught up with some of the best nail artists in the business to get their predictions on what lies ahead for our nails next year. Here’s all the inspiration you need. Wellness Nails View this post on Instagram A post shared by Harriet Westmoreland (@harrietwestmoreland) The “clean girl” nail aesthetic has been one of the most enduring nail trends of the last couple of years but in 2025 we’ll see it go one step further with a focus on nail health. “Nail care is evolving, with a focus on health-conscious products that support and protect natural nails,” says Juanita Huber-Millet, founder and creative director of Townhouse. “From breathable polishes to strengthening treatments, consumers are seeking out products designed to provide a nourishing, wellness-led experience that support natural nail growth.” Manucurist’s Active Glow in Raspberry, $19, is a 2-in-1 treatment polish that leaves nails with a rosy sheen while nourishing them with sweet almond oil and raspberry extract. Navy Blue View this post on Instagram A post shared by Julia Diogo (@paintedbyjools) All the nail experts are in agreement: Navy blue will be on everyone’s nails in 2025. “Blues in general will be popular but navy will continue to be a standout color for the upcoming seasons,” says session manicurist Ami Streets. “It’s a chic, deep hue that looks great as an edgier manicure color while still being softer and more elegant than black.” Julia Diogo’s perfectly executed navy nails are timeless. Try Chanel Le Vernis Nail Color in 127 Fugueuse, $32, for a luxurious at-home manicure. Milky Pastels View this post on Instagram A post shared by Julia Diogo (@paintedbyjools) There’s nothing new about pastels, especially in spring and summer, so it’s no surprise that all the experts I spoke to predicted they’ll make a resurgence next year. However, 2025’s iteration is going to be more pared-back than ever. “As we move into spring, I’m expecting milky shades that provide a fresh, [clean] aesthetic to be popular as they look effortlessly beautiful and put-together,” predicts international nail artist and one of Bio Sculpture’s top technicians, Julia Diogo. Her soft lavender manicure in Bio Sculpture Fluttering Lavender, $13, fits the aesthetic perfectly.  Marble Elements View this post on Instagram A post shared by San Sung Kim | 김산성 (@sansungnails) Streets has marbling pinned as a nail trend that’s set to take off in 2025. “Marbling inspired by natural events like the sunrise, skies or the ocean works really well interpreted into nail art looks, so I think this trend will be one to watch,” she says. This marbled take on a sunset by San Sung Kim is so beautiful that it might just be first on my new year manicure wish list.  Tiffany Blue View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jaz (@paintbyjaz) Call it Tiffany blue, turquoise or aqua, this holiday-ready cyan might just be the breakout shade of 2025. Diogo notes the influence of “Tiffany blue taking over recent catwalks” as an indicator of what’s to come, while Streets talks of “aqua blues and greens inspired by the ocean with opalescent or shimmering finishes” emerging as popular choices next year. OPI’s Nail Lacquer in My Dogsled is a Hybrid, $11.99, is a similar sea green to the one used in Jaz’s minimalist double French manicure. Velvet Shine View this post on Instagram A post shared by Queenie Nguyen | elevated nail artist (@nailartbyqueenie) Texture is going to be huge next year and velvet finishes look set to adorn everyone’s nails. “Texture is really going to take centre stage in 2025 and velvet delivers on both depth and dimension,” explains Huber-Millet. “It’s a subtle yet impactful design that will appeal to those who like more intricate details over ostentatious embellishments.” Queenie Nguyen’s cinnamon velvet nails make for the perfect cosy fall and winter look. Recreate it at home with Beauty Pie’s Wondercolor Nail Polish in Bright Bronze, $14. Micro French View this post on Instagram A post shared by CORRINNA BIANCA | LONDON (@corrinnabianca) Not all of 2025’s nail trends are going to be new; there are plenty of manicure looks that have proved popular this year that experts think will stick around for the long haul. “Minimalist nail art isn’t going anywhere,” declares pro nail artist and educator Jessica White. “Designs like micro French tips have become staples because they’re wearable and versatile.” Corrinna Bianca’s cold brew latte French tips are so delicately painted and chic. Try it yourself (with a steady hand!) using Essie Nail Polish in Odd Squad, $11.10. Three-Dimensional View this post on Instagram A post shared by Melanie Graves (@overglowedit) Diogo is unequivocal about one thing for 2025: It’s all about dimension. “3D nail art was one of the biggest trends of 2024 and I have no doubt that it will continue to dominate in 2025,” she says. “I’m absolutely loving 3D swirls and outlines right now. It’s a great option for anyone who wants to try something a little playful.” Melanie Graves has shared so many amazing multidimensional manicures this year, but this monochromatic look is particularly cool. Fine Embellishment View this post on Instagram A post shared by Wendy (@mydumbnails) While 3D texture and nail decorations will continue to trend, Streets predicts a shift towards a more minimalist approach to adornment in 2025. “Embellishments will still be super popular but I think that these will be toned down in favor of more refined adornments like pearls and crystals,” she explains. Wendy’s shimmering manicure is both pretty and pared back. Get your hands on Pueen Nail Charms Multi Shapes Nail Art Kit, $5.74, which contains so many beautiful pearls and gems, to create your own version at home. Rich Burgundy View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lauren ✨ (@lolo.nailedit) While linen pastels and milky hues will take off for spring, we can still expect to see deep, rich shades reign supreme in 2025. This year’s obsession with chocolate brown will continue but we’ll see a shift towards merlot and burgundy, as illustrated by Lauren’s sultry red manicure. “Burgundy is going to remain a favorite in 2025,” confirms Diogo. “I’m noticing a lot of buzz around Bio Sculpture’s new Ghost Noir polish [available to licensed professionals only] which is nearly black with deep red undertones for a mysterious yet sophisticated vibe.” Celestial Yellow View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sonia Sanchez | GelX Nail Artist | 818 San Fernando Valley (@klawsbysonia) As we move into summer, experts agree that oranges and yellows are going to be hugely popular for manicures. “Bold orange and energizing yellow colors will really liven up your manicure in 2025’s warmer months,” predicts Streets. But it’s “celestial yellow” that she thinks is going to be everywhere. “Inspired by otherworldly elements like the sun, moon and stars, it’s one to add vibrancy to your nail look,” she says. Try OPI Nail Lacquer in Exotic Birds Do Not Tweet, $11.99, to recreate Sonia Sanchez’s embellished citrus manicure at home. Subtle Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by @yo_keshh “Chrome nails have been everywhere this year but I think they may start to feel overdone as we move into 2025,” says White. She predicts that rather than a “full-coverage chrome finish”, we’ll see a shift towards more subtle chrome accents and softer detailing for a more understated take on the trend. Keshia’s abstract gold chrome tips are the perfect example. Like what you see?

    "description": "I'm not going to lie - I really put my hair through the ringer. I have been coloring it blond for the last 15 years, I use heat to style it, and I've never once taken a lukewarm shower to protect my hair follicles. Oops, I guess. So that means I really rely on quality, hard-working products to keep my hair from losing its luster. Hair masks, in particular, are my holy grail. I use them both in the shower and overnight in a treatment bun a couple of times a week to really squeeze in all of the hydration I can. I currently swear by the Sisley Paris Intense Nutrition Hair Care Mask ($135). Every time I use it, my hair looks like spun gold and feels absurdly silky. Read on to learn how the Sisley formula gets it done. About the Sisley Paris Intense Nutrition Hair Care Mask It adds softness and shine to hair in just five minutes. The formula contains five oils (coconut oil, meadowfoam oil, moringa oil, macadamia oil, and shea oil) and Kokum butter to hydrate hair. Ceramides and Baobab proteins surround hair in a protective barrier to prevent split ends. The ingredients are all plant-based. The hair mask has a subtle, fresh, floral fragrance. The mask is best suited to people with dry to very dry hair. What I Like About the Sisley Paris Intense Nutrition Hair Care Mask Just like I'm a fan of ultra-thick moisturizers for my face, I'm partial to thick, concentrated masks for my hair - and this Sisley mask delivers. The texture is slightly sticky and creamy, which really makes it feel like it's clinging to every strand of my hair. Despite that, it distributes over my length easily without having to use a comb to move it through to the ends. I also like that this is a relatively fast-acting mask; it only requires five minutes in the shower. When I am in the mood for an overnight treatment, this one works well on damp hair wrapped in a bun or braid. When I wash it out in my morning shower, my hair feels truly changed; it's always super lustrous and soft. The subtle scent is also a favorite of mine - it doesn't overpower my senses or skew too sweet. How to Use the Sisley Paris Intense Nutrition Hair Care Mask The brand recommends using the mask on damp hair for five minutes and then rinsing it out. I follow this method, but as I mentioned, I also like to leave it on overnight. If I'm using it in the shower, I'll shampoo my hair like normal and then use this treatment in place of my conditioner. I'll wring out as much water as I possibly can from my ends, apply the mask from mid-length down (never on my roots), and use a claw clip to keep it wrapped up and out of the water while I finish the rest of my shower. What to Consider Before Trying the Sisley Paris Intense Nutrition Hair Care Mask Everyone's hair texture is different, so you should consider your personal hair-care needs before trying this mask. If your scalp is on the oily side or your hair is super fine, this mask may be too heavy for you. TL;DR, this mask won't harm your hair - it might just be too rich. Where Is the Sisley Paris Intense Nutrition Hair Care Mask Available? The Sisley Paris Intense Nutrition Hair Care Mask is available at sisley-paris.com and at retailers such as Saks 5th Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Dermstore, Bloomingdales, and Bergdorf Goodman.

    "title": "Finally, Overnight Heatless Curls That Are Comfortable to Sleep In and Work",

    "description": "It's no secret that I'm a huge fan of hair hacks, especially of the heatless variety. I've been on a healthy hair journey for the last few months, and any activity that promises to make my hair look good with minimal damage is at the top of my list to test. One thing I've noticed about overnight hair hacks, however, is that they tend to be really freaking uncomfortable to sleep in. I'm not a great sleeper in general (despite my meticulous nighttime routine, which includes melatonin, a white noise machine, and red lights - just to name a few), so adding a funky contraption on my head really doesn't help matters. I get annoyed even sleeping with a silk bonnet, and sometimes I have to make a decision between getting a full eight hours and waking up with a frizzy mess. Recently, I came across a viral heatless curl hack on TikTok that users on the platform have confidently deemed \"extremely comfortable to sleep in.\" Rather than using a heatless hair rod, it made use of a silk scarf. Keep reading to hear how my experience went. Testing this hack came at the perfect time - I had a date the night before, so I washed and dried my hair. However, I needed my blowout to last me the next day until it was time to go out on a second date (I'm really trying to cram things in before the end of the year) because I didn't want to style my hair two days in a row. Once I got home from said first date, I quickly took a body shower, hopped out, grabbed the scarf I had on hand, and got to work. I won't lie - getting my hair set up with this method took a little finagling. Most people started out with damp hair, but mine was completely dry. I wrapped my scarf so it looked like a little taquito and placed it around the back of my head before securing it with a claw clip. I divided my hair into two sections split down the middle, and I started braiding the left side of my hair but subbed in the scarf as the third piece of hair. Once I finished braiding the first half, I secured it with a silk hair tie and I moved onto the other side. When both were finished, I twisted them up together and tied them using the ends of the scarf. A few tutorials showed people spritzing their hair with hairspray, but I opted to skip that step because I didn't want to add any product to my hair. Then, I headed to bed. I popped 10 mg of melatonin as I usually do and I only woke up once in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. The heatless hair method wasn't uncomfortable to sleep on whatsoever, and I could actually switch from lying on my back to my side easily without hesitation. The real test, though, was seeing how everything looked in the morning. When I got up and unwrapped my hair, I was shocked to see how much volume I had at the roots compared to other overnight heatless curls. The curls were the tiniest bit tighter than I wanted them to be, however, once I brushed them out, they looked amazing. It's safe to say this is going to be my new go-to hair hack. If you've been searching for one that's actually comfortable to sleep in, try this out. Renee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.
