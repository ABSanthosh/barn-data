    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/baby-rhinoplasty-editor-experiment-49304831",
    "description": "Statistics reveal rhinoplasties to be the most popular facial plastic surgery procedure, trending upward since 2020, according to the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (AAFPRS). In addition to its universal appeal across genders and ages, this is also due in part to its dual functional role in restoring nasal breathing. In fact, board-certified plastic surgeon Jason Roostaeian estimates that 75 percent of his surgeries include septum repair of a deviated septum, also known as a septoplasty. As a beauty editor, I have known for years that if I ever opted for a nose-related procedure, Dr. Roostaeian would be my chosen doctor. I love his natural results, which I call a \"tidy\" aesthetic: nose bridges are straight but never \"scooped,\" occasionally leaving hints of dorsal character on the bridge; nose tips are always refined and yet never pinched or upturned (once healed). Aesthetically, he takes the overall harmony of the face into consideration while the nose's reductive integrity is prioritized and even improved surgically. But it was debatable whether the ultra-subtle results I sought would be worth the stress, costs, and risks of surgery: why go through an invasive procedure when post-op swelling would presumably exacerbate my aesthetic concerns for months before resolving them? My exterior concern was that the tip lacked refinement, widening and turning downward when I smiled. Two trusted plastic surgeons, though not rhinoplasty experts, had mused that a \"baby rhino\" was probably not worth it. Yet as a bonafide wellness fanatic (a Virgo, with four major planets in the Zodiac's most health-minded house), I was also intrigued about the \"two birds, one stone\" efficiency of the septo-rhinoplasty, a combined rhinoplasty and septum repair from a deviated septum. I have always had a passion for complementary alternative modalities and integrative health - including a love of breathwork, from the Wim Hof technique to yogic practices. I did have a deviated septum that I now suspect is linked to complications I dealt with from my severe allergies. By my 30s, I had managed the worst of my symptoms by removing allergens from my life - namely, by giving up horseback riding and limiting exposure to my equine \"babies,\" Sunny and the now-deceased Hans - but after a miserable bout of COVID-19 while in Italy last August, I revisited the matter. I was again plagued with residual sinus pain and more frequent wake-ups in the night feeling that my nasal pathway was blocked and inflamed. My boyfriend and I had gotten into a fight while I was quarantined abroad in his childhood bedroom, and the rebellious ring of a \"revenge rhino\" propelled me to book my consultation. (Dr. Roostaeian did not love the term and was quick to lecture me that any surgical procedure should be done only for my own happiness.) Keep reading to learn about my experience getting my super-subtle, ultra-natural baby rhino procedure with Dr. Roostaeian. Experts Featured in This Article Jason Roostaeian is a board-certified plastic surgeon, rhinoplasty expert, and clinical professor at UCLA. The Process: Choosing Your Surgeon Opting for any surgery is a highly personal decision, and it is important to take your time researching the procedure and your preferred surgeon. I have had extensive professional opportunities to review surgeons' rhinoplasties for years. By helping my best friend in her search for a rhinoplasty surgeon (and even attending multiple consultations with her at some of the most renowned surgeons' offices in California), I had already long-selected Dr. Roostaeian as my preferred rhinoplasty expert. This removed a major stressor from the process. Understanding the ins and outs of the procedure helped me mentally prepare. Because he is a professor, he took the time to go in depth on its evolution - from the structural rhinoplasties of the 1980s/early 2000s (wherein cartilage was cut away but left the nose lacking in strength), to the structural rhinoplasties that use cartilage grafting to reinforce longevity and strength, to the minimally invasive preservation philosophy that salvages as much of the bridge, soft tissues/ligaments, and cartilages as possible. In my case, the end result would be more aligned with my aesthetic preferences but also structurally stronger than before, facilitating better breathing for the long-term. Photos are great, but it also really helps to see a surgeon's work in person. Before I even knew Dr. Roostaeian, I was introduced to a patient of his that was only one week out from surgery. I was so amazed by her beautiful, natural results, and her rapid healing time, that I asked for his information on the spot. Aside from his word-of-mouth repute within the industry, the other reasons I knew he was \"the one\" for the job were his demonstrated aesthetics, his surgical technique, the consistency of his results, and certain perks to having the surgery at UCLA Health. What Is a Baby Rhinoplasty? A baby rhinoplasty can look like many things, but it typically involves the surgeon making minimal changes for a more natural-looking nose job. As for the subtlety of my own procedure, I knew that Dr. Roostaeian's use of cutting-edge equipment like the ultrasonic piezotome (which minimizes damage to the surrounding tissues and reduces downtime) would afford him the precision needed in a surgery where \"every millimeter counts.\" I personally looked for his patient cases where he preserved degrees of the dorsal hump, because I like the character on the bridge of my nose. (Occasionally, he also does this to avoid feminizing the faces of men patients.) Most importantly, even when straight, his bridges are never \"scooped\" once healed. Not all baby rhinoplasties are combined with septoplasty, but they can be. You also don't need to go to a pricy plastic surgeon for the latter, but the benefit of having my surgery at UCLA meant that they submitted my septoplasty directly to my insurance. Though unseen, it plays an important medical role, while Dr. Roostaeian's subsequent aesthetic work protects the longevity of your repair. \"The nose is a better filtration system for your breathing, from your nasal hairs to all the mucosal surface area,\" he tells PS. My Baby Rhinoplasty Consultation At my consultation, we spoke about my concerns and my preferences, and he showed me past patients' before-and-afters whose cases compared most closely to mine. As mentioned, my concerns ultimately came down to the lack of refinement toward the tip of my nose, which turned downward and appeared to widen when I smiled. Dr. Roostaeian noted that this was caused by a lack of support in the tip creating a contour of light and dark that bothered me. By adding support to the tip with a piece of cartilage from my septum - what is technically a \"tipoplasty\" - he would be able to strengthen my nose, create a light-contour that created the refined aesthetic I craved, while fortifying the septum repair and ensuring better breathing over the long-term. My cartilage would be maintained, but subtly overlap, to yield symmetrical and result in improved structural integrity. He would perform this via an open surgery, and because of my deviated septum, a large portion of my surgery would be submitted to insurance. I also knew he would take his time \"tinkering\" while I was on the table to ensure that the end result met his perfectionistic standards. The main question was: why go through a lengthy healing time where my swollen nose would temporarily appear less refined than before, particularly when my \"before\" was not so dire? Well, because my baby rhino would be relatively minimal - my nose would not be broken; he referred to it as more of a \"finesse\" - his delicate technique was important to me. I felt confident in his demonstrated minimal downtime (thanks to his technique and things like creating his own nasal stents to facilitate drainage and lessen bruising and pressure), so I felt ready to commit. My Baby Rhino Prep Five days before surgery, Dr. Roostaeian had me begin applying antibacterial ointment to the insides of my nostrils. I had to discontinue certain supplements, like my fish oil, but incorporated others, like the HealFast Pre-Op Healing Optimization Formula and Post-Op \u0026 Injury Formula ($99, originally $140). As Dr. Roostaeian points out, the surgeon can only control what is happening on the surgical table. After that, the body takes over and the long-term healing process begins. It is up to your decisions to help or hinder this process - and I had every intention to help it. I booked an appointment with naturopathic doctor Nadia Musavvir to create a plan to optimize my recovery. After running everything by Dr. Roostaeian for approval, she helped me with healing supplements like liposomal vitamin C and enteric-coated Life Extension Specially-Coated Bromelain ($16), tips on tweaking my diet to reduce post-op inflammation, and recommended wellness practices to support my recovery. I stocked up my fridge with vegan broths and soups from Erewhon, organic berries to add to my InflammaCore smoothies, and special probiotics to take both while on antibiotics and after getting off of them. Day of Surgery On the morning of surgery, I dropped my dog off at her dog sitter and checked in to the L'Ermitage Hotel in Beverly Hills, where I would stay overnight. Then I headed over to UCLA Medical Center. I was a little nervous but felt better at the hospital. I found the professionalism of medical personnel, whose everyday exposure to these procedures makes them normalized, very comforting. Once in pre-op, a flurry of nurses and health experts took my vitals and asked me questions, running me through what to expect. Then I waited in the bed in my hospital gown under heated blankets, wishing I could drink water and have a snack. When Dr. Roostaeian arrived, he showed me the drawings he had prepared to plan out my surgery. Then the nurses gave me a sedative cocktail, and I was asleep before I even reached the surgical room. From what I've gathered, Dr. Roostaeian created an incision in my columella to get a better look at the inside of my nose (this is what makes it an \"open\" rhino). He was surprised by the extent of my deviated septum toward the top (or \"posterior\") of my nose, which helps to explain my years of improper drainage from my sinuses. As expected, he repaired my septum and used some of its cartilage to build structure behind the tip of my nose - creating a more contoured tip, but also providing the strength that would account for the longevity of my results and improved breathing. For overall harmony, the bridge was lowered a bit from the base, and some cartilage was made to overlap for strength and symmetry. A hint of my dorsal hump was also maintained. Baby Rhinoplasty Before and After When I woke up, I was in a hospital bed surrounded by Dr. Roostaeian and two of my friends. I had a cast on the outside of my nose with tape creating pressure beneath it. I felt no pain but was very drowsy and wondered if I had had an intense \"night sweat\" because my hair was wet. (I didn't - they washed it.) Dr. Roostaeian went over my prescriptions with me, answered a few of my questions, and showed me my before-and-after pictures from the operating table. Then it was time to go. When we got to the hotel, I had planned to order room service and watch a movie for a girl's night. No sooner had I changed into Clementine silk pajamas and propped myself up against the monogrammed pillowcase, that I fell asleep. I got up frequently throughout the night to go pee thanks to all the fluids during surgery, but I slept on and off for about 13 hours before checking out in the morning. Healing Week 1 The most jarring part of the entire process was that I could not focus my eyes when I woke up the next morning. Then Dr. Roostaeian let me know that my problems focusing were from an anti-nausea patch behind my ear. Once I removed it, things quickly went back to normal. When I got back home, an extensive regimen of antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and healing supplements kept me occupied. I had been told by surgeons in the past that rhinoplasty recovery was not painful, but I didn't believe them. The fact is, it wasn't. I was bruised and puffy, but I didn't even take Tylenol during my recovery. Only the unbearable congestion was uncomfortable; I didn't know it yet, but there were giant stents up the inside of my nose to support my septum while it healed. I kept all pressure off my nose, but I used my favorite at-home device, the Lyma Laser ($2,695) - which is editor-loved - to reduce inflammation and promote healing on the exposed tip. I knew the tip would take the longest to heal, and while inflamed, it would appear to be rotated upward, which I dreaded. This was my main concern, because when it is taped into its cast, it will also appear lifted. Aside from being worried that I would roll onto my face in my sleep, I felt fine. The hospital gave me gauze and tape to apply beneath my nose, and I figured out a way to tape it to the side of my cast, sparing my skin from the adhesive. The hospital had given me a NeilMed nasal rinse, but at times the blockage was so severe that the saltwater would shoot back out the same nostril. Still, I functioned like normal and even interviewed the actor Julia Garner, who thought I sounded like I had the flu. Cast Removal (1 Week Post-Op) One week later, with residual bruising that I could cover with concealer, it was time to have my cast removed. At the appointment, Dr. Roostaeian pulled gigantic nasal stents out of my nose that were covered in snot and dried blood. Then I could finally blow my nose, which was a moment I had been dreaming of for a week. I was given my first look - it was definitely swollen but looked cute - and I took my first set of \"after\" photos. He also taught me to tape my nose in case I wanted to minimize swelling, but he let me know taping is not necessary. I was nervous at that appointment and tried to delay seeing what was underneath. I heard from friends that seeing their faces in the mirror after surgery was jarring. To be honest, it looked like a normal nose - just not my nose. I was not upset the way they had described, but I definitely wanted the swelling to go down. Though I had been forewarned that while healing, the swollen tip would appear upturned, it still drove me crazy (and I felt like I had a \"bulb\" on the tip of my nose). Immediately after my appointment, and still very unsure of how it looked, I took my new nose to Erewhon for my favorite smoothie. Then I headed to a work event where no one could believe that I had just had a nose cast removed. Healing Week 2 With Dr. Roostaeian's approval, I also did cryotherapy to promote its healing at Pause Wellness and had a vitamin IV of vitamin C, magnesium, glutathione, and a push of NAD+. I focused a lot on lymphatic drainage massage by going to Lymphatic by Siane for regular massages and got his OK to use the oxygenating and cooling CO2Lift Pro Carboxy Therapy Mask ($300), which I did as often as my budget allowed. In addition to flooding the skin with oxygen to promote healing, the cooling effect of the gel is soothing and anti-inflammatory. By day 12, I thought my nose looked cute. It was the first time I had seen it in makeup, and it was shocking to me because the light/shadow contour truly was mimicking what I typically used makeup to create. I loved the way it looked straight-on when I smiled because the tip no longer dropped down and widened thanks to its new cartilage support behind it. From the side, the tip still bothered me; although it continues to refine by the day, the swelling is real and will be for four months. Healing Week 3 My friends tell me that it does not look like I had anything done; that my nose just looks good. But as its owner, I tend to scrutinize it. While I wait out the first four months of the most noticeable swelling, I am amazed by the degree to which its inflammation can fluctuate on a daily basis. I will also say that my nose looked amazing after receiving a Signature Facial by aesthetician Katie Sobelman, with gentle facial and buccal massage, microcurrent, PEMF, and more, topped off by my beloved CO2Lift mask. I run every modality by my surgeon, which is probably very annoying, but he has been a gracious ally in my rigorous healing journey. I did have a setback in healing at day 19, when I got injections of regenerative Nanofat and PRP in my face. Dr. Roostaeian had approved this procedure - so long as the doctor did not touch my nose - but warned that it might cause swelling due to the injectable delivery method. Suffice it to say, my entire face, including my nose, blew up. This gave me important perspective because the nanofat injections were a much more difficult procedure than my baby rhino. A little over two weeks later, the swelling subsided and the contours of my face started returning to their baseline. Baby Rhinoplasty Before and After Is Baby Rhinosplasty Worth It? For me, yes, but that does not mean it is worth it for everyone. Aesthetically, it resolved my main complaint with my nose when I smiled in photos, and I no longer worry about how it will age. (Board-certified plastic surgeon Marc Mani let me know that nose tips get droopier with age.) But remember that this is a regular stressor for me because of the nature of my job, which requires frequent headshots of makeup and skin care; it simply comes up more often for me than for the average baby rhino-seeker. As for the septum repair, I will say that arrived on the day of surgery with sinus pain, and I have not had it since. Aside from my first week of healing, I have not woken up unable to breathe through my nose the way I used to, so I have noticed a major improvement in my nasal breathing. I also had a remarkably easy recovery; so swift that some have suggested I'm a \"super-healer.\" I have friends that have had complex rhinoplasties, and I want to make it clear that their recoveries were not as easy as mine. My positive experience has to do with Dr. Roostaeian's skill and the subtlety of the baby rhinoplasty he performed. I am now at six weeks post-op. It took me less than two weeks to get used to my nose, even in its swollen state. I already like it more straight-on, although the side view of the healing tip still occasionally irks me six weeks later. Some days I experience worse swelling than others - most recently when my dog hit me in the nose with the surgical cone around her neck - but I have an extensive toolkit of healing modalities to draw from instead of fixating. Dr. Roostaeian tells me that around month four, my nose will be incredibly close to the end result. Then, for up to a year or even two, continued refinement will take place in the tip, making my result better and better. Now with the surgery behind me, I think it speaks to my confidence in my decision - and my surgeon - that I have referred several of my friends to his practice.

    "description": "Ariana Grande may not be the most tattooed celebrity in history, but her collection of ink is still pretty impressive. Over the years, the \"Wicked\" star has amassed more than 50 designs, and she doesn't appear to be slowing down anytime soon. In fact, she revealed in a recent interview on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" that she and costar Cynthia Erivo have gotten a bunch of new designs for the movie, including a few matching inks and an illustration of the original Glinda from the 1900s book. Grande's tattoos span her entire body, from her neck down to her feet, and each one is uniquely her. Many tell a story and hold sentimental value. She has a tattoo of the nickname her grandfather gave her, a few that reference her favorite movies, and various other culture–related designs (like a \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" quote). She also has a long list of designs that represent her career in music, like a \"Sweetener\" World Tour tattoo she got with her bandmates. But that's not to say that all of Grande's tattoos are meticulously thought out or always go as planned. There was that incident with the infamous \"7 Rings\" tattoo, and over the years, she's had to get quite a few old tattoos from past relationships covered up. Some of the star's designs are in not-so-obvious spots, like her ribcage, while others are on full display. By far, her easiest designs to spy are her many hand and finger tattoos. The star has also been slowly getting a handful of her older designs lasered off, including the Eevee \"Pokémon\" tattoo on her inner arm. But fear not: we rounded up her full collection ahead. To get a closer look at Grande's tattoos and learn about their meanings, read on.",

    "title": "Yes, You Can Wear Braids On Your Wedding Day. Here’s Why I Did",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/braids-natural-hair-wedding-day?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "The quest for the perfect wedding hairstyle is a rite of passage for any bride. It’s a journey that often involves navigating through a seemingly endless sea of inspiration, where trends and traditions collide. #Hair, in general, is an online world saturated with trends like “buss down wigs” and the allure of “what lace?” closures. Add in the words “wedding” or “bride,” and I found myself drowning in a tidal wave of what seemed like countless hair choices. Cascading curls, sleek updos adorned with delicate accessories, and the ever-present promise of a flawlessly installed set of extensions—the options are dizzying. Eurocentric beauty ideals so often dominate this landscape that I, as a Black woman preparing to marry the love of my life, found myself searching for something more. It wasn’t until the idea of bridal braids surfaced that I truly felt inspired. Throughout the initial stages of my 18-month engagement, I had several stylistic considerations. One minute, I pictured a sophisticated updo; the next, a romantic headband look captured my imagination. I even entertained the idea of a chic, straight bob. Yet, with each style, I felt a disconnection from my core identity. As I explored bridal inspiration online, the stark absence of Black brides sporting braids became undeniable. Even when I added “Black girl” to my search, I mostly found outdated representations, such as Brandy Norwood in her iconic role in Cinderella. This limited portrayal felt both frustrating and inadequate. The lack of representation of braided wedding hairstyles highlighted an ongoing underrepresentation of natural and protective styles in a space that should celebrate diverse expressions of beauty. This reality challenged prevailing beauty standards and deepened my desire to see myself genuinely reflected in my bridal look. On my wedding day, I wanted to feel completely present, free from the distractions of constant hair adjustments. The thought of my lace lifting, tracks showing, or worrying about my extensions while dancing filled me with unease. Confidence is essential for me, and braids promised just that—they’re effortless. Growing up in a predominantly white neighborhood and attending a PWI in college, I embraced my love for dancing, often whipping my hair around like I was in a Britney Spears video. The anxiety of managing a meticulously styled updo as I moved to “Back That Azz Up” was daunting. In contrast, braids offered me a liberating alternative, allowing me to enjoy my day without hair-related worries. Plus, thinking ahead to my honeymoon, just two days later, the convenience of needing only a scarf, shampoo, and conditioner instead of schlepping a full set of styling products overseas was incredibly appealing. It was about feeling like myself and embracing each moment without hesitation. However, the choice to wear braids at my wedding was more than just practical; it was deeply rooted in my identity. While I was embarking on a marriage with a wonderful man from a cultural background different from my own, my connection to my roots became deeply important. We knew we were going to incorporate some aspects from both of our cultures, like getting married under a traditional Chuppah, smashing the glass, jumping the broom, doing the Hora, and having a soul train line. We both wanted our wedding day to reflect our authentic selves.  I had a vision that on my walk down the aisle, I would feel not only beautiful but also deeply connected to my heritage. This desire echoed my experience when I competed in the Miss California USA pageant in 2020 as Miss Santa Monica USA. I chose to wear my hair in Passion twists for a similar reason. For me, I never want a day meant for feeling “beautiful” also to be a moment of feeling like I’m assimilating into Eurocentric beauty standards. I felt that braids help me feel aligned with my Blackness in a way that enhances my sense of beauty because I am being my authentic self. Braids have become a powerful symbol of self-acceptance, and they allow me to feel even more beautiful because, in this style, I am unapologetically myself. So “just wear braids,” I’m sure some people would say. However, interestingly enough, it was not a straightforward decision. When I raised the idea of braids to others, I encountered instances where elders were not entirely convinced that it was the right choice. There were subtle suggestions that more “traditional” styles might be more appropriate for such a significant occasion. My husband, then-fiancé, while supportive and well-intentioned, offered the classic but ultimately unhelpful sentiment that I looked pretty in every style while I weighed my decision. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciated his support, it just left the onus squarely on me to make a decision, and yet that made it feel even more deeply personal and meaningful. Months passed, and “I haven’t decided yet” became my standard response to the inevitable hair question. A reply that I soon learned was somewhat unusual for a bride. My decision to wear braids on my wedding day was driven by a multifaceted desire for authenticity, practicality, and a profound connection to my identity as a Black woman… Finally, approximately three months before the wedding, a moment of inspiration arrived. My clarity came from my intrigue with “Zoe Kravitz braids,” a style similar to one shared by “braid architect”, Brooke DeVard, on TikTok a year prior—a braided leave-out style. Its functionality for upcoming work travel appealed to me. It seemed like the perfect blend of chic and practical, a style that could effortlessly transition from a film set, business meeting, or date night. My braider executed the style beautifully: a nearly full head sew-in with the leave-out styled in intricate, small boho braids with human hair. Looking in the mirror, I felt an immediate sense of ease and confidence. It was then that I thought, “This will be my wedding hairstyle,” and I immediately scheduled a follow-up appointment for the week of the wedding.  When I make a decision, I make it quickly and ten toes down. However, the specific styling for the big day remained a game-time decision, a delightful mystery I chose to unravel in the moment. “It will find me,” I told my future mother-in-law, who surely thought her usually Type A future daughter-in-law was maybe unraveling.  On the morning of my wedding, my mission was simple: stay calm and soak in the joy. I wanted those precious hours before the ceremony to bubble with laughter and anticipation, not chaos. So, I opted out of professional hair and makeup, choosing instead to channel my inner artist. After all, having competed in the Miss USA/Miss Universe Organization, I was no stranger to styling my own hair and makeup. If my skills could land me second runner-up in Miss CA USA and shine on Hollywood’s red carpet, why not let them shine on my big day? For those willing to hand the reins over to a pro, no judgment here! But for me, this was about discovering my style in real time, embracing the creativity of the moment. Hair and makeup are art forms, and on this day, I was both the artist and the canvas. I set aside ample time (the beauty of being a DIY bride) and found a rhythm as I began braiding my hair, initially envisioning a bun. But then, the braid took on a life of its own—simple yet elegant, with tendrils framing my face. I added a stunning bridal headband that brought a touch of fairytale magic, blending classic bridal elegance with a contemporary twist. As a sweet detail, my bridesmaids repurposed pearls from our wedding décor, attaching them to bobby pins that adorned my braid. The transformation took just 20-30 minutes, and as I gazed at my reflection, I felt like a Disney princess ready to step into my new life.  Future brides, just know that this is all that matters: making it down the aisle to say your vows to your beloved in front of your people. As I walked down the aisle, my royal cathedral-length veil was the real showstopper, and it added so much drama to my Chosen By Kyha Arta gown, which had its own train. My hair, something I spent months contemplating yet only minutes styling, was not the main focus; it was me, the bride, walking down the aisle with both of my parents by my side as I beamed.  Future brides, just know that this is all that matters: making it down the aisle to say your vows to your beloved in front of your people. I arrived at the chuppah, my father unveiled me, and I stood next to my future husband. The simplicity of my hair allowed my beaming smile to be displayed without distractions. I felt so beautiful and was not thinking about my hair or makeup for one second. The reception and beyond only solidified my decision. Following the cocktail hour, I removed my veil, allowing my braided hairstyle to be more fully seen during our first dance. It was a moment of unveiling, not just of my hair, but of a deeper sense of self. As the reception transitioned into a lively party, I easily styled my hair into a half-updo, the braid creating natural and beautiful waves throughout my tresses. The bonus was the freedom to dance all night without any concern about my hair while being thrusted into the air during the hora, or nailing my Britney Spears choreography, or absolutely losing it to “Shake That Monkey.”  Ultimately, my braids proved to be the perfect hairstyle for my wedding day. They weren’t just a style; they were a statement. My decision to wear braids was driven by a multifaceted desire for authenticity, practicality, and a profound connection to my identity as a Black woman in a world that often elevates certain beauty standards. Choosing braids felt like a personal affirmation and a celebration of my heritage on a deeply significant day. God willing, my future grandchildren, maybe so far down the line I’ll never meet them, will look at these photos, the night our limbs on the family tree started, and they’ll see a grandmother who was boldly herself.   I am proud that I was able to honor my past, embrace my present, and step confidently into my future. For other Black brides navigating their wedding beauty choices, I hope my experience underscores the beauty and validity of embracing natural and protective styles, allowing you to feel completely and confidently yourself. Your most authentic self is your most beautiful self, and you deserve to celebrate that on your wedding day and every day.  Erin Jones-Wesley is a Los Angeles-based creative executive and co-host of the podcast Meghan: Like Us.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nordstrom-fragrance-perfume-sale?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Fragrance deals are quite hard to come by, so when we heard through the grapevine that Nordstrom will be offering 15% off across the majority of its fragrances from May 5 to 11, we knew we wanted to spread the good news far and wide. Whether you’re hoping to top up on your signature scent or expand your fragrance wardrobe, this Nordstrom beauty sale is a good one to engage in a little “blind” buying. For the uninitiated, “blind” buying means picking up a fragrance without ever having smelled it IRL. There are some levels of risk involved, but with Nordstrom’s stacked perfume roster, you’re in really good hands. Of course, you could always read the reviews to decide, but it’s certainly helpful to have an expert’s take. Ahead, we’ve tapped our network of beauty editors and fragrance enthusiasts to share their top Nordstrom perfume section picks that are worth the splurge. DashDividers_1_500x100 Le Monde Gourmand Fraise Fouettée Eau de Parfum, $25 $21.25 “I’ve tried a few fragrances from Le Monde Gourmand and have been very impressed. The brand has done an excellent job of bottling up delicious, dessert-like perfume notes all at a rather reasonable price point of $25. Chai Épicé in particular has been my go-to scent this past winter, as the medley of muguet musk and blonde woods evoke a steamy cup of masala chai. Ahead of the summer, I’m excited to give Fraise Fouettée a try. Strawberries are a trending ingredient in fragrance this year, and Le Monde Gourmand’s version combines juicy strawberries with refreshing coconut water and whipped sugar.” — Venus Wong, senior writer Rabanne Million Gold for Her Eau de Parfum, $135 $114.5 “Rabanne’s Million Gold For Her is easily my most complimented perfume — people always assume it’s a niche brand at first sniff. Heady white florals, skin-like musk, and leafy rose come together in a warm, sensual, all-encompassing scent. I reach for it before a night out when I’m really feeling myself, but it’s just as dreamy as a bedtime fragrance. Honestly, everything in Rabanne’s burgeoning perfume collection is a winner.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director Bvlgari Eau Parfumée Thé Vert Eau de Toilette, $164 $139.40 “This is such a classic green tea scent I always find myself reaching for on a warm spring day — it’s crisp and refreshing, but thanks to the eau de toilette formulation, the gorgeous blend of green tea, bergamot, and neroli petals lasts all day. Back in ’92, this blend was created exclusively for Bvlgari’s most elite clients, so I can’t help but feel very Mariah Carey every time I mist it on.” — Marianne Mychaskiw, beauty writer and TV host Creed Aventus Fragrance, $365 $310.25 “I love wearing this iconic fragrance. It’s the definition of beast mode, packed with pineapple, moss, and citrus. This combination makes you feel confident and adventurous. It’s unique because it combines traditional masculine wood and smoky notes with a confident and fresh juiciness from the pineapple. It quickly achieved iconic status when it launched in 2010. The fragrance saw a resurgence in the early 2020s thanks to social media, particularly TikTok where men were talking about ‘beast mode’ perfumes that last long. Aventus fits that profile.” — Kudzi Chikumbu (aka Sir Candle Man), fragrance expert Parfums de Marly Valaya Exclusif Eau de Parfum, $250 $212.5 “Whenever I’m feeling a bit shaky or upset, this is the scent I turn to for comfort. It envelops you in a lovely scent cloud of orange blossom, vanilla, and sandalwood, further amplified by a powdery almond top note, which leaves a velvety musk that lingers on the skin. It feels just like slipping into a plush bathrobe after a long day. In fact, I spritz this on my favorite fluffy robe.” — Venus Wong, senior writer Maison Francis Kurkdijan Baccarat Rouge 540 Eau de Parfum, $335 $284.75 “Baccarat Rouge is unmistakably unique. Its blend of warm saffron, creamy jasmine, spicy fir resin, and skin-like ambergris is almost impossible to replicate, at least not well. Every time I catch it on someone in the street, I’m reminded why it’s so beloved: the scent trail lingers for days, even weeks, clinging to clothes without ever feeling overpowering or cloying. Despite its grown-up composition, it’s the subtle sweetness that keeps me coming back for more. Baccarat Rouge rarely goes on sale, making this the perfect moment to snap up a luxury icon at a discount.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director DS \u0026 Durga Italian Citrus Eau de Parfum, $210 $178.50 “I love pulling this fragrance out in the spring and summer. As the name suggests, it’s a great daytime scent that is fresh, bright, and citrusy. If, like me, you’re someone who doesn’t prefer floral or sweet notes, this may do the trick!” — Kate Spencer, senior affiliate partnership manager Byredo Gypsy Water Eau de Parfum, $230 $195.50 “I have a tester vial of Gypsy Water and have been guarding it closely. I’ve been waiting for a sale to justify a full-bottle purchase, and the time is finally right. This is the scent I want to wear every day because it ticks every box. It’s a warm, woody, and smoky fragrance with a core of sandalwood, amber, pine needles, vanilla, and incense, freshened up by zesty lemon and bergamot notes. This means it works for both day and night — it’s seductive without being too heavy and cloying — and for both summer and winter. When I have a full bottle at my disposal, I want to spray it on my fresh laundry so I can smell it all the time.” — Esther Newman, affiliate writer Gucci Osmanthus Nectar Eau de Parfum, $270 $229.50 “This juicy and woody scent is perfect for the summer. Dripping in apricot and super elegant with the osmanthus and sandalwood, this is grown, sexy, and fun. Osmanthus is right on trend; it almost smells like apricot skin, with leather undertones similar to suede. It’s a soft, more wearable, juicy scent — not syrupy or juicy. I love it!” — Kudzi Chikumbu (aka Sir Candle Man), fragrance expert Jo Malone Velvet Rose \u0026 Oud Cologne Intense, $160 $136 “I thought long and hard about buying this scent before parting with my money, and it’s worth every penny. Despite it being a cologne, it projects and lasts well, so you only need one spritz at a time. My heavily used bottle still looks full. It’s a beautiful rose scent that, because of the oud, reads darker and more seductive than the rose you might associate with your grandmother. I love how it makes me both feel (confident) and smell (delicious). My friend has this fragrance, too, and whenever I notice it on her, it’s like a warm hug, so I can vouch for it being a pleasant experience for those close by, too!” — Tanyel Mustafa, senior writer Penhaligons The Dandy Eau de Parfum, $250 $212.50 “I’ve only ever finished a couple of perfumes — I’m usually that picky — and The Dandy is one of them. In fact, it’s become my new signature. Tart raspberry, rich oak, creamy cedarwood, and a hint of smoke (yes, really) might not make sense on paper, but together they create something powdery, comforting, and nostalgic. I can’t get enough. Recently, someone even chased me down a train platform to ask what I was wearing — and it wasn’t even their stop. It’s usually on the pricy side, so I’ll take any chance to snap up another at a discount.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director Hermès Barénia Eau de Parfum, $108 $91.80 “I haven’t stopped thinking about this scent ever since smelling it at an airport duty-free boutique, and I think Nordstrom’s sale is the time to make it mine. I don’t normally love floral scents, but this one has a warm, skin-like quality that’s so unique and sophisticated. Notes of lily, miracle berry, patchouli, and oakwood combine to create a sensual, intoxicating scent that I can’t wait to wear this summer and beyond.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer Phlur Golden Rule Eau de Parfum, $99 $84.15 “I’ve been on the hunt for a sweet-smelling fragrance that also feels grown-up for years. I have found that in Phlur’s Golden Rule. With its fruity, gently floral notes and sandalwood base. This perfume is sweet without being sickly. It’s feminine and bold, which is the aura I’d like to project! I get compliments every time I wear it. I was relatively unfamiliar with Phlur’s range, but Golden Rule is now my daily (and nightly) go-to.” — L’Oréal Blackett, Unbothered Editor Tom Ford Soleil Neige Eau de Parfum Travel Spray, $75 $63.75 “I’m getting married this month (!) and plan to wear Tom Ford Soleil Neige as my wedding day fragrance. (It’s described as a “citrus floral musk that mimics the serene shimmer of sun on snow,” — perfect for my ski mountain-side ceremony.) I have a full-size bottle already, but I’m planning on getting a travel spray as a gift for my mom, who has similar taste in perfume as I do. (BTW, Mother’s Day is coming up!) I hope she’ll love wearing it as much as I do — and thinks of my wedding day when she does.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer Creed Carmina Eau de Parfum, $300 $255 “Creed is always an investment, but if it’s on sale and you’re obsessed with how this smells, it might be worth that splurge. Carmina is more sophisticated than most amber-woody-florals out there, without smelling too intense or complicated. The floral notes balance the woody ones, so this floral doesn’t read as being super young or too masculine. You also don’t need to spritz it several times, as this punchy fragrance projects and lasts well on the skin even as it starts to fade. It’s a special treat that’ll last a long time.” — Tanyel Mustafa, senior writer Marc Jacobs Daisy Wild Eau So Intense, $125 $106.25 “Remember that tropical Barbie from the ’90s that came with a tiny bottle of perfume? This new drop by Marc Jacobs is very that, but all grown up. This scent opens with a fruity-floral burst of banana blossom and jasmine, while the amber at the base makes it feel extra luxurious. Plus, the bottle is almost like an art piece on its own.” — Marianne Mychaskiw, beauty writer and TV host Valentino Donna Born in Roma Extradose, $115 $97.75 “This fragrance always gets me compliments from the R29 team. I have it living on my desk and use it post early morning gym sessions before heading into work. It’s what I’d call an ‘easy scent’, in that it’s pleasant to plenty of noses, strikes the balance of being noticeable without verging on overbearing, and suits a variety of contexts. I often use fragrance to suit my mood or my agenda for the day, with some of my scents being reserved strictly for nights out or for casual coffee runs. This, to me, works no matter where I go. Coconut isn’t listed in the notes, but I can detect a subtle hint of it alongside the floral vanilla. It’s fun, fresh, and enjoyable to wear.” — Tanyel Mustafa, senior writer Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",
