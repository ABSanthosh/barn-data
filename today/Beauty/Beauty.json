If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. For most of my life, there were a few words I’d look out for when shopping for a moisturizer: ‘Light,’ ‘gel’ (including offshoots like ‘water-gel’ and ‘gel-cream’), and ‘weightless.’ Anything that promised rich, occlusive hydration had me running in the opposite direction. In hindsight, I was perhaps too cautious of products that would clog my pores and congest my skin because I had the breakouts to prove it. But if there’s one person who could solve this issue, it’s Sofie Pavitt. The NYC-based esthetician and founder of eponymous skincare brand Sofie Pavitt Face is among the most sought-after beauty pros when it comes to clearing complexions — and for good reason. Put simply, an acne breakout hates to see her coming.  Having launched her brand with the Mandelic Clearing Serum (which won a Beauty Innovator Award in 2023), she’s intentionally developed a comprehensive range of products inspired by — and for — her clients and their most pressing concerns. After a gel-to-foam cleanser, depuffing ice toner pods, micellar cleansing pads, and benzoyl peroxide mask followed suit, she’s gearing up for what may have been her most daunting launch yet: A decadent, intensely nourishing moisturizer that won’t break you out.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Best moisturizer for oily \u0026 acne-prone skin Omega Rich Moisturizer, $64 Pavitt says the Omega Rich Moisturizer is like a “love letter” to her clients’ complexions. Her clients frequently asked if they could start using rich moisturizers even if they were experiencing breakouts because oily skin and dry patches can often coexist. A white space was identified — the desire for a non-comedogenic (aka non-pore clogging) yet luxuriously rich hydrator — and Pavitt developed Omega Rich as a result. The name is a nod to the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in the formula, which moisturize deeply, smooth texture, and balance sebum. Other notable ingredients are a trifecta of jojoba, argan, and sunflower oils, plus squalane to lend additional replenishing benefits. I felt like this was a product truly made for my skin. I’m 31, but still get stubborn breakouts every so often. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve wanted to level up my moisturizer, but I admit that I’ve struggled to find one that my skin doesn’t reject. This one was truly love at first feel: The texture is utterly divine, and it absorbs into the skin quickly, bestowing an instant, healthy glow. It was richer than what I’d typically reach for, but I knew Pavitt would never do me dirty. Sure enough, after a week of nightly use, I already began to see a subtle difference in my skin; my face felt softer and more supple, and the barely perceptible lines of texture on my forehead (where I tend to get the driest) were less noticeable. There’s a fine line between dewy and greasy, and miraculously, this didn’t take me over the edge to oil slick territory. At $64, it’s a plush moisturizer at a plush price, but it’s worth every penny. I used to rob my skin of moisture in the hope of nixing my incessant breakouts, only to have inflamed, severely irritated skin as a result. In my experience, well-hydrated — and what I like to call “happy” — skin is the kind that ultimately clears up. I’m convinced that years of compromising my skin barrier only made my acne worse. If you feel the same, there’s now a barrier-repairing cream that will love your skin back. Like what you see?

    "description": "If you've ever had a reflective manicure - chrome nails, for instance - and you thought they were the epitome of bright and shiny, trust us when we say what you had going on was nothing compared to Jennifer Lopez's latest set. The star recently sported a manicure that makes us want to start a petition to have her change her name from J.Lo to J. Glow, because saying her nails \"shine bright like a diamond\" is an understatement. Lopez recently shared an Instagram post with the caption \"Business Trip,\" sporting a brown, oversized, two-piece suit. She paired the look with platform heels and sunglasses, but our eyes were drawn to her crystal manicure. The set included hand-drawn butterflies, crystals, and french tips, making it perfect for maximalists. Her recent nail look was created by celebrity nail artist Tom Bachik, who shared a breakdown on his Instagram. Bachik is responsible for some of our favorite celebrity manicures ever, and he frequently works with stars like Margot Robbie and Selena Gomez. To get Lopez's latest look, he started out with Gel-X tips and then drew butterflies on a few of the nails using the Mia Secret Gelux Black Gel Polish ($11). The real show-stopper, though, was the Swarovski crystals he used to adorn her nails. View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝙏𝙤𝙢 𝘽𝙖𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙠 Nails (@tombachik) This isn't the first time Lopez has had her fingers encrusted with jewels. Previously, in November 2024, Lopez performed at the Elie Saab show in Saudi Arabia wearing a feathered and sequined teal number, which was polished off with one of the most perfect manicures we've ever seen. The look, which was also created by Bachik, featured over 250 crystals. \"The nails had between 25 and 50 crystals per nail,\" Bachik says. \"I actually removed crystals from the sides to keep nails slender and to make key crystal placements the focus and more impactful.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝙏𝙤𝙢 𝘽𝙖𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙠 Nails (@tombachik) For that manicure, Bachik shared on Instagram that he started by prepping the nails using the Tweezerman x Tom Bachik Ultimate Nail Care Set ($59). From there, he applied the Aprés Gel-X Sculpted Coffin Tips ($17) in clear. Next, he used the Kokoist Platinum Filler Base ($25), which he followed with the Mia Secret Chrome Silver Gel Paint ($9). Bachik used a chrome powder that isn't available for purchase yet, and then covered the nails with Swarovski crystals. To top everything off, he added Mia Secret Metallic Flakes ($10). And to further prove that J.Lo. is the queen of crystal nails, Bachik did a similar look for Lopez's Super Bowl nails in 2020. Renee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.

    "description": "Minimalists, if you've been looking for a new nail trend to try, you're going to want to pay attention. The latest manicure taking over our social media feeds is called \"soap nails,\" and it's perfect for fans of \"rich-girl\" nails and \"bubble-bath\" nails. Plus, it's already celebrity-approved by none other than the queen of minimalist manicures herself, Hailey Bieber. Not only did she basically invent the glazed-doughnut manicure, but she's also been the cover girl of many other nail trends, including maple-syrup nails, cinnamon-roll nails, and plenty more. Typically, you can find Bieber with a long, almond-shaped nail, but recently, in a photo teasing her new Rhode lip liners, she opted for short nails in a square shape with a sheer, soapy-pink polish. Plus, Selena Gomez and Kylie Jenner were also seen testing out the popular manicure recently as well. We're predicting the soap nails trend is only going to get more popular in the coming months now that it's been given the stamp of approval by some of our favorite celebrities. Ahead, experts share how to get the look at home, and more. Experts Featured in This Article Elle Gerstein is a celebrity nail artist based in New York City. Olivia Van Iderstine is nail brand Olive and June's manicure trend expert. Thea Green is the founder of nail-care brand Nails Inc. What Are Soap Nails? \"Soap nails are a trend characterized by a soft, translucent, and glossy finish that mimics the smooth, slightly sheer look of a bar of soap,\" Thea Green says. \"Soap nails and milky nails are both trends featuring soft, semi-opaque, and glossy finishes, but they have subtle differences in their aesthetic.\" Another key aspect of soap nails is the shine. The point is to almost make the nail look wet, as though your hands have just come out of a bath. \"Because soap nails are so neutral, they truly work and look amazing on every nail shape and length,\" Olivia Van Iderstine says. \"For a super fresh and easy look, we love them on shorter nails, but you truly can't go wrong.\" How to Get Soap Nails If you're heading to the salon, the easiest thing to do is bring a reference photo with you. \"Ask for a neutral sheer polish without too much pink pigment in it,\" Van Iderstine says. \"The look is milky, so look for shades that have a touch of white. The rest is totally up to you - choose from milky peach, pink, white, or a touch of beige.\" If you want to re-create the look at home, nail prep is key. \"Ensure your nail plate is nice and clean to begin, with your cuticles pushed back and buffed away,\" Van Iderstine says. \"Smooth the nail plate with a soft buffer to ensure your surface is sleek.\" You'll want to start off with a long-lasting top coat, like the Nails Inc. Get Hard Nail Treatment ($9). From there, use a sheer or jelly-like polish, like the Olive and June The Queen Takes Her Tea With Milk ($10) or the OPI Nail Lacquer Nail Polish in Bubble Bath ($23). Top everything off with a cuticle oil or serum. To go the extra mile, make sure your hands look their best as well. The finishing touch on soap nails is plump skin that looks healthy and glowy without the grease. \"To get glowy skin, think of treating your hands and nails just like your face with skin care,\" celebrity manicurist Elle Gerstein says. Gerstein recommends using a hand cream with arnica, like the Seaweed Bath Co. Ultra Hydrating Hand Cream ($10).
