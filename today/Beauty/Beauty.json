    "description": "Welcome to Sun Blocked, Refinery29’s global call to action to wake up to the serious dangers of tanning. No lectures or shaming, we promise. Instead, our goal is to arm you with the facts you need to protect your skin to the best of your ability, because there’s no such thing as safe sun.  I watch, transfixed, as a cosmetic scientist proves that a sunscreen claiming to contain SPF 45 might actually have, if you can believe it, an SPF of 3.6. Not SPF 30 — not even SPF 15 — but SPF 3.6.  Posted on TikTok by Dr. Julian Sass, the video shows the staggering process he goes through to uncover that the sunscreen in question could contain almost no protection from ultraviolet damage. Dr. Sass shows the full extent of the alleged fraud: Firstly, a suspiciously transparent consistency. Secondly, the ingredients list, which is missing many of the usual ingredients that typically constitute mineral sunscreen, like zinc oxide, for example. Then, an inspection under ultraviolet light: Sunscreen should appear completely black under UV as it absorbs the light, but this sunscreen fails to do so. Eventually, Dr. Sass conducts in vitro lab testing. His findings are shocking. @drjuliansass This company may be selling a fake sunscreen… #skincare #spf #sunscreen #skincareproducts #skincarecommunity #beauty #sunscreenviral ♬ original sound – Dr. Julian Sass Compared with two genuine sunscreens, Dr. Sass reported that the supposed-fake SPF protected skin for a third of the time — and from UVB rays only. Dr. Sass proposes that, despite the claims printed on the tube, it is not broad spectrum (so it would not protect skin from UVA, also present in sunlight, and which causes premature aging and skin cancer). In fact, Dr. Sass purports that the product contained none of the sun-shielding ingredients stated on the label. Disturbingly, his experience is not unusual. Counterfeit skincare products abound online, with K-beauty products being some of the most regularly faked. Korean beauty, one of the world’s most innovative and lucrative cosmetic hubs, is often touted as the gold standard for sunscreen — how is it so convincingly ripped off? I had placed an order for Beauty of Joseon’s Relief Sun Rice and Probiotics SPF50 PA++++ when I spotted a listing for the same product at a much lower price. The seller even had the same brand photos. I had heard rumors of counterfeit products being sold online, but I told myself that they wouldn’t be able to do that with sunscreen, surely.Janine Falcon, freelance writer and beauty content creator How easy is it to accidentally buy fake sunscreen? Janine Falcon, a freelance writer and beauty content creator who goes by Beauty Geek online, unknowingly bought a counterfeit Korean sunscreen, ensnared by the cheaper price and convincing packaging. “I had just placed an order for Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Rice and Probiotics SPF50 PA++++ when I spotted a listing for the same product at a much lower price. The seller even had the same brand photos. I had heard rumors of counterfeit products being sold online, but I told myself that they wouldn’t be able to do that with sunscreen, surely,” she shares with Refinery29. “I’d never used the sunscreen before, so I had no reference point for the packaging or box when it arrived.” The reality of the situation dawned on Falcon when it came to applying the product to her face; the chalky, paste-like consistency refused to blend or absorb. What’s more, the tamper-proof foil cover slid off suspiciously easily, and alarm bells started to sound. @janinefalcon Excited to try Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun SPF 50+ PA++++, renowned for its elegant texture, hydrating formula and invisible finish…. That’s NOT aligning with this experience. But SO MANY PEOPLE, including some I know and trust, can’t ALL be wrong. Something is amiss. Stay tuned for PART 2. #SkinTok #SkinCare #koreanskincare #kbeauty #sunscreen #sunscreenviral #beautyofjoseon #counterfeit #korean_skincare #Beautygeeks ♬ X’s files parody _1 minute loop(1079525) – KeySets “I never cancelled the original order (from reputable seller stylekorean.com), so when it arrived, I was able to properly compare the products. There were multiple differences: The genuine Relief Sun Rice and Probiotics SPF50 PA++++ is a pale cream lotion with a light, silky texture that absorbs into the skin easily. The fake just sat on the surface of my face.” Echoing others who were duped into buying an alleged counterfeit version of the Relief Sun SPF, Falcon describes the packaging as feeling coated in aluminum rather than plastic. She details the depressions left on the tube after squeezing and the lack of a proper expiry date. The thing is, these differences are small and easy to overlook when sellers are using stolen brand images to market their sunscreen as genuine. Beyond positive seller reviews, which many of these counterfeit outfits have, there is little to alert buyers to a potentially fraudulent product. Due to the high number of imitations, Beauty of Joseon has since introduced a QR code printed onto its packaging that buyers can scan to confirm that the product they’ve bought is genuine.  Round Lab, a hugely popular K-beauty skincare brand, has repeatedly had its bestselling Birch Juice Moisturizing Sunscreen SPF50+PA++++ falsely duplicated, to the extent its website now includes an authenticity page, created to help buyers spot counterfeit versions. The differences between a fake and real Round Lab sunscreen include bolder, curvier font and a lack of spacing between letters. These are differences that consumers could easily miss. A slightly bolder letter or slanted writing could believably be attributed to a printing error or manufacturing mishap. But at what cost are we making these mistakes? @janinefalcon PART 4 in this fake Beauty of Joseon SPF 50 PA++++ saga… Yes, ANOTHER COUNTERFEIT from Amazon.ca, plus tips on buying legit @Beauty of Joseon skincare online safely. Refund for THIS fake via Amazon.ca was prompt and accompanied by “We are sorry we disappointed you.” 😑 Up next: how to get your refund from Amazon even if the third-party seller lies, becomes difficult – or the product page disappears before you realize you got a counterfeit… #SkinTok #SkinCare #koreanskincare #sunscreenviral #sunscreen #counterfeit #BuyerBeware #beautyofjoseon #Beautygeeks ♬ original sound – Beautygeeks SHE/HER What are the risks of using counterfeit sunscreen? The risk of wearing counterfeit sunscreen (with a provable lack of sun protection) is too serious to ignore. Skin cancer, an abnormal growth of skin cells, is caused by exposure to ultraviolet light; this includes sunlight and tanning beds. It occurs in three main types: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, and can differ in appearance based on skin tone.  Basal cell carcinoma, for instance, typically presents as a glossy black bump on brown and Black skin, while on white skin it usually appears as a semi-transparent bump. These distinctions are important. Squamous cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer, is the result of overexposure to ultraviolet radiation and can present on exposed skin (hands, scalp, face) but also on places that aren’t as exposed, like the inside of the mouth or around the genitalia. This is most common in people of color. Finally, melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, begins in the melanocytes (the pigment cells that give skin its color). Do not believe very low prices — they are often too good to be true — and don’t buy from unverified sellers. It’s a gamble that’s just not worth taking.Dr. Paul Banwell, skin cancer expert SPF, whether a gel, cream, stick, mist, or powder, is specifically designed to protect skin from ultraviolet light. When that barrier is compromised, whether by a lack of reapplication, insufficient protection factor, or, in the most sinister of instances, due to a counterfeit formulation, the consequences can be life-threatening. One in 41 women and one in 35 men will be diagnosed with melanoma in their lifetime. This isn’t meant to scare you. Skin cancer is preventable with regular use of SPF and living in a UV-conscious way. This can range from wearing a brimmed hat when you’re outside (in the sun or the shade) and sunglasses to protect the delicate area around your eyes (the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wrap-around styles that block UVA and UVB rays). Even wearing a pair of UV gloves for gel manicures can limit your amount of UV exposure. Crucially, it means nixing tanning beds, avoiding sunbathing, using a sunscreen that is at least SPF 30, and not forgetting to reapply. It also means ensuring the SPF you buy is legitimate. How do you spot fake sunscreen? Dr. Paul Banwell, a skin cancer expert who runs The Banwell Clinic and the previous head and founder of The Melanoma and Skin Cancer Unit, shares his advice on spotting fake SPF. “Do not believe very low prices — they are often too good to be true — and don’t buy from unverified sellers. It’s a gamble that’s just not worth taking. After that, look at the packaging for misspelt words or a lack of certification, and when it arrives, make sure the seal is intact, too.” The best practice is to stick to sellers you know and trust. Whether through brand websites, large-scale operations like Sephora, CVS, and Ult,a or smaller independent cosmetic retailers, an extra layer of protection is guaranteed. Purchasing from a third-party vendor can run the risk of a seller easily hiding behind anonymous accounts and stolen photographs. As Falcon shared, the point of these transactions is not to fool you into thinking the product you bought is authentic, it’s to collect your money and prove elusive when you have a negative review and refund request.  The cumulative effects of unprotected UV radiation can lead to the uncontrolled growth of damaged cells, forming tumors and increasing the likelihood of skin cancer, including melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma.Dr. Sophie Mormen, a consultant dermatologist at the Cadogan Clinic “Counterfeit SPF is fairly uncommon, but it’s prevalent in two kinds of places,” Dr. Sass shares, and alarmingly, it isn’t always online. “First, places like spas and dermatology offices.” This, says Dr. Sass, is because practice owners will often buy private, white-labelled products from companies, put their branding on them, and then sell these products on to their customers. The issue here, Dr. Sass explains, is that once the product has been bought, it isn’t checked again by a chemist to ensure that the product matches what’s printed on the label. It’s an easy win for shady sellers looking to dupe customers. When asked about the process that dermatology offices go through when procuring products, Dr. Ifeoma Ejikeme, a medical consultant, skin expert, and founder of the Adonia Medical Clinic, says that while she can’t speak for all clinics and medical professionals, her team has received specialized training in cosmeceuticals. “We collaborate directly with brands and are approved suppliers, purchasing products directly from manufacturers and distributors to guarantee authenticity,” says Dr. Ejikeme. For this reason, it pays to ensure that your chosen dermatology practitioner or doctor is properly qualified. Check that they are recognized on the General Medical Council (GMC) register. Another potential red flag is Amazon, says Dr. Sass. Of course, plenty of legitimate beauty brands have their own official Amazon Stores. Here, “Visit the store” links refer customers to verified pages with genuine products. But Dr. Sass notes that anyone can open a listing and start selling — the provenance of sold products is unclear. Sure enough, R29 research found that unauthorized sellers often adjust their names to imitate recognized brands. Refinery29 reached out to Amazon for a comment on counterfeit and fraudulent sunscreen potentially being sold on its website. We were told that “Amazon has a zero-tolerance policy for counterfeit products,” and that it has “proactive measures in place to prevent counterfeit products from being listed.” The statement notes that the online store is “continuously monitored” but makes no mention of which measures or what monitoring are actually in place. Amazon has since removed one of the fraudulent listings of the Beauty of Joseon SPF. A number remain active. What is the best sunscreen? When it comes to sunscreen, you can separate products into two categories: mineral (or physical) and chemical. This refers to the types of filters (the things that shield your skin from UV rays) that the formula contains. Dr. Ejikeme says, “Mineral sunscreens contain active mineral ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. These ingredients predominantly sit on top of the skin and work by reflecting and scattering UV rays away from the skin.” Chemical sunscreens, on the other hand, contain organic (carbon-based) compounds. “These include oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate, and octinoxate,” says Dr Ejikeme. “They predominantly absorb UV radiation and convert it into heat, which is then released from the skin.” People of color have long bemoaned mineral sunscreens for the white or purple cast they leave on the skin, a result of the titanium dioxide and zinc oxide that physically block the UV rays. However, a new generation is emerging, with brands such as Black Girl Sunscreen, iS Clinical, and Paula’s Choice creating formulations that protect without the tell-tale ghostly glow.  “Mineral sunscreens are more stable than chemical sunscreens, which means there are often fewer preservatives added to the formulations,” says Dr. Sophie Mormen, a consultant dermatologist at the Cadogan Clinic. “This can make them preferable to those with sensitive skin.” Chemical SPFs are more versatile and come in various formats, including transparent, gel-like consistencies (Supergoop! Unseen Suscreen is a prime example of this), plus tinted serums and traditional creams and mists. The most important thing is to wear sunscreen regularly, rain or shine, on holiday or at home. “The cumulative effects of unprotected UV radiation can lead to the uncontrolled growth of damaged cells, forming tumors and increasing the likelihood of skin cancer, including melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma,” warns Dr. Mormen. “Consistent sunscreen use helps to block or absorb these harmful rays, reducing the risk of DNA damage and ultimately lowering the risk of skin cancer.” If you’re unsure of the protection your SPF provides, Dr. Sass has an easy solution: “If you’re concerned about whether your sunscreen is real or not (or if it’s adequately protecting you from the sun), consider using UV stickers.” They are usually readily available from many retailers as well as verified Amazon storefronts. “These stickers turn purple when they’re exposed to the sun,” adds Dr. Sass. “If you put the sticker on your skin or even a piece of paper, put the sunscreen on top of the sticker, and then go outside, the sticker shouldn’t turn completely purple, since the sunscreen should block most of the UV from getting to the sticker. This should be enough to tell you whether or not your product is capable of providing sun protection.” While sun stickers can be beneficial, they shouldn’t be used as your only form of sun protection. It is recommended to reapply sunscreen every two to three hours if you’re out in direct sunlight. Dermatologists advise that the average adult should use 30ml of sunscreen for a head-to-toe application. That’s almost one-third of a 100ml bottle. Whatever you choose, Dr. Banwell, who performs mole checks, mole removal, skin cancer removal, and reconstructions daily, has some parting advice. Make sure that the formula you pick is a broad spectrum, meaning it’ll protect against UVB (which causes redness and sunburn, as well as skin cancer) and UVA rays, which also cause cancer and aging of the skin. Lastly, keeping an eye on your moles (changing or otherwise) is easier when you use the ABCDE protocol, which stands for Asymmetrical, Border, Color, Diameter and Evolving, a handy acronym for the following questions: Does the mole or spot have an irregular shape with two parts that look very different? Is the border irregular or jagged? Is the color uneven? Is the mole or spot larger than the size of a pea? Has the mole or spot changed during the last few weeks or months? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then it’s time to speak to a professional.  For more information on the signs of skin cancer, The Skin Cancer Foundation has a list of things to look out for. As always, if you are concerned, reach out to a medical professional promptly.  This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lenox-and-sixteenth-serum-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "It all started a couple of months ago at a beauty event during Art Basel. I was milling about the room when a beauty founder friend of mine told me I couldn’t leave without meeting Amy Peterson. I’d heard of her before — she’s a celebrity medical aesthetician with a confidential list of high-profile clients. As it turns out, she’s been working on launching her own line of products, inspired by the treatments she provides in her clinic located at the cross-streets of — you guessed it — Lenox and Sixteenth in Miami Beach. As someone who has had acne for nearly half her life (I’m 31), I loved the concept — and could see why it was the talk of the party. A quick intro later, and Peterson herself handed me lab samples of one of her soon-to-be hero products, The Laser Serum, right then and there as we sipped on our club sodas. The name is a nod to the product’s brightening, resurfacing benefits — not unlike the in-clinic laser treatments Peterson is known for. Powered by a trifecta of lactic, glycolic, and mandelic acids, The Laser Serum gently exfoliates skin for a visibly brighter, even-textured complexion. “I loved seeing patients’ skin change when I did a laser treatment or microneedling, but didn’t feel like there were products on the market that offered similar results without substantial downtime,” Peterson tells me. “For example, a lot of people have issues with retinol. So I felt like if I could create [something better]…” And so, Peterson’s dream product was born.” The Laser Serum, $219 After I got home, I took the tiny, nondescript sample from my purse and immediately added it to my nighttime routine. Plain bottle or not, the stuff inside was liquid gold. Within a week, I was noticing touchably smoother skin and fewer breakouts (“It’s amazing for acne as well,” she says). After I finished my second lab sample (she generously included two, so I had more than enough time to experience the product), I was convinced that this could be the next big name in luxury skincare — not something I throw around lightly. At $219, it’s expensive. But compared to other similarly priced serums, I have to say — it’s worth every penny. “In office treatments and at-home care go hand in hand,” Peterson explains. “And I actually think in-office treatments inspire better at-home care because you’re trying to protect your investment.” The serum’s texture is lightweight, but absorbs quickly,  with just a hint of tingle. After two months of nightly use, the stubborn texture around my chin and jawline had dramatically improved, and the acne hyperpigmentation on my cheeks was barely noticeable. Following The Laser Serum, Lenox and Sixteenth is also launching The Preservationist — a vitamin C serum-cream hybrid. “I wanted to create a one-stop shop vitamin C,” Peterson shares. “The texture and the glow you get is incredible.” Along with vitamin C, The Preservationist includes peptides and vegan exosomes to plump, firm, and strengthen the skin barrier. “I believe people come into the clinic and they’re either put in two different categories: corrective or maintenance,” Peterson says, adding that she’s noticed an uptick in clients looking to “pre-juvenate” — aka, get ahead of visible signs of aging with smart, savvy treatments and products that keep skin looking its best.At $249 (or bundled with The Laser Serum for $398), the decadent, creamy texture is a dream to use. I’ve been dabbing it on at night, since it’s a bit rich for my oily skin during the day. (The exception: using it as skin prep on makeup days, since it creates a glowy, hydrating base.) My skin has always tolerated vitamin C well — even in high concentrations — and I loved layering this after The Laser Serum as a moisturizer, then locking in all the goodness with an oil or additional cream, depending on how my skin was feeling. (BTW, the dark brown glass doesn’t just look luxe — it helps block sunlight and heat that can compromise the integrity of notoriously fickle vitamin C.) “I joke with my team [that] I wish they could package me in every bottle so I could show up at your house and see how you’re doing,” Peterson tells me. “The reason we have a successful practice is because I’m all over it. I want to make a difference. I want to see change. I want that to happen, and I care a lot.” Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes If you know me, you probably know I love being tan (maybe a little too much - especially when I was 15). Now that I'm nearly 30, I've learned a thing or two about sun exposure and the not-so-great effects of tanning. The result? A less tan version of me - but you'd never know it. I fake it 'til I make it. One brand I've been loving lately is Lux Unfiltered, created by digital creator Sivan Ayla (who I've followed for years). Her products are non-toxic, super hydrating, and - most importantly - they actually work. You've probably heard of the viral No. 32 Gradual Self-Tanning Cream (our editors are also fans of the No. 12 Bronzing Face Drops). But to give even more love to Lux Unfiltered's standout lineup, I'm here to say: the No. 18 Illuminating Beauty Balm Sticks ($34) are my secret weapon to a year-round glow. About Lux Unfiltered No.18 Illuminating Beauty Balm Sticks No.18 is fragrance-free and made with non-toxic ingredients. It comes in four shades: Chili (a spicy red), Salty (a glossy bronze), Sunset (a sun-kissed pink), and Tropics (a tan, bronzy hue). Each stick contains 0.5 oz of product. The key ingredient? Mango butter for a creamy, hydrating finish. What I Like About Lux Unfiltered No.18 Beauty Balm Sticks Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes I've owned the Chili and Tropics shades of these sticks for about three months now, and the difference in compliments I get is palpable. The combo gives me that lit-from-within, sun-kissed, bronzy glow - without any actual sun time. And it's so easy to wear. I use it on both makeup days and no-makeup days; it just makes me look healthy and alive. Even when my skin isn't feeling 100 percent in the dead of winter, it looks like it is. The formula is incredibly hydrating and practically melts into my skin. Honestly, I don't even need moisturizer when I use it - that's how glowy it is. And because it's so nourishing, it blends like a dream. I just use my fingers, and I love the result. At this point, I even keep a few in my purse (as you can tell from how beat up they are - I use them for everything). How to Use Lux Unfiltered No.18 Beauty Balm Sticks Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes The product is pretty versatile - the brand even notes on its website that you can use it on your cheekbones, temples, nose, or \"anywhere you wish to illuminate.\" I've even used it on my lips, and it worked beautifully, adding the perfect pop of color. Personally, I usually apply it to my cheeks, nose, and forehead for a natural wash of color, then blend it out with either my fingers or a blush brush. The formula is definitely pigmented, but once blended, it gives a soft, natural-looking flush. And if you want more intensity, it layers really well without looking cakey. What to Consider Before Trying Lux Unfiltered No.18 Beauty Balm Sticks One thing to note before purchasing this product is that it's quite creamy. If it's delivered in a warm environment, it's recommended that you pop it in the fridge before opening. This helps the product maintain its shape and prevents it from getting damaged in the process. I definitely made this mistake, and it affected the shape of my balm sticks - so take my advice and refrigerate it first, just in case!

    "description": "Since the 1800s, blue eyeshadow has walked a tightrope between tackiness and glamour, falling into one camp or the other depending on who you ask. The ruling class, who had controlled the writing of history for millennia, quite literally clutched their pearls at the ladies of the night and female impersonators painting their lids in shades of cerulean. But for those on the margins of society, blue eyeshadow has been a tried-and-true beauty staple for those who demand to be noticed. \"Blue eyeshadow has such a history in [the sex work] realm, going back even to the Victorian era,\" says makeup artist Annie Johnson. \"It's extreme femininity and all about representing who you are.\" Experts Featured in This Article Annie Johnson is a New York-based makeup artist whose work can be seen on Mikey Madison in the Oscar-winning film \"Anora.\" Meatball is a Los Angeles-based drag queen and host of the \"Sloppy Seconds\" podcast. The Painted Ladies Long before phrases like \"clean girl\" and \"old money\" populated our TikTok algorithm, we wielded the apparent absence of makeup to signify wealth, status, and class. The 19th-century equivalent of this was the rejection of makeup by upper-class women of the Victorian era to set themselves apart from the \"painted ladies,\" a term that referred to the brothel workers of this time. Natural beauty, wherein the goal was to appear pale and free of any facial blemishes, was the standard of \"good girls\" of this time period and drastically contrasted the \"painted look\" that was deemed provocative and promiscuous. \"The first rule in applying eye makeup, you can never have enough blue eyeshadow,\" Jamie Lee Curtis, \"My Girl\" (1992) Both sides aspired for extreme paleness, with the wealthier women abstaining from sunlight at all costs and applying chemicals such as arsenic, opium, ammonia, and mercury to their skin to achieve the desired looks. Prostitutes and performers instead opted to paint their skin with white enamels to cheat this aesthetic and used eye paints in colors like black, red, and blue to draw attention to themselves. Stealing From the Silver Screen An embrace of cosmetics would later come into the mainstream in the next century, as many women aspired to emulate the beauty of popular actresses of the time, and commercialized cosmetics became more readily accessible (lest we forget, less dangerous to apply). As time went on, on-screen looks became more theatrical and glamorous, culminating in one of the most iconic displays of blue shadow the world had ever seen: Elizabeth Taylor in 1963's \"Cleopatra.\" Image Source: Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images The film, which at the time was one of the most expensive movies ever made, mimicked the drama and excess of the storyline through the makeup on Taylor's Cleopatra. Not only was her eyeshadow blue, but it was highly pigmented, painted up to her eyebrows (today, we'd call this garage door eyeshadow), framed by thick black liner, and topped off with glitter. This look would not only prove to be influential to film history, it would also become inspirational to one of the foremothers of drag by extension, and the queer ecosystem as a whole. Divine's Inspiration For Drag Queens Divine - drag artist and muse of filmmaker John Waters - deeply admired Taylor's work and pulled inspiration from one of the actor's most famous looks into her own beauty mug, which included bold blue eyeshadow during her role in 1972's cult classic \"Pink Flamingos.\" And just like Divine was inspired by Liz, in turn, generations of drag queens have paid homage to Divine through their makeup. \"When I first started drag, I was majorly influenced by Mimi Bobeck from 'The Drew Carey Show,' and then I got really into Divine, I always wanted to be a blue garage door slut,\" says Meatball, a Los Angeles-based drag queen. Recalling a conversation she had with fellow drag queen Willam, Meatball continues, \"[Willam] was like, 'Oh yeah, you should try blue eyeshadow. Blue eyeshadow is for real hookers and whores.' That clicked and now it's the one color I go to.\" Image Source: Meatball, Photograph by Jordan Service Photography For Meatball, her choice of eyeshadow color not only paid homage to Divine and Bobeck (who was doing drag in her own right), but it stood out from every other color in her makeup palette. When using costume and stage makeup, which was a go-to for queens back in the day, blue was the easiest for Meatball to blend, and it proved to be the brightest and most pigmented. Not to mention, for queens who were doing multiple shows a week, it didn't stain the skin like a red, pink, or purple shade might. \"With blue, I can do it really fast and it'll stay on and bright for the whole day,\" says Meatball. \"Whereas with other colors, as you sweat, they get kind of muted or muddy. Blue is always gonna be blue.\" Forever Blue Nowadays, we not only see blue eyeshadow gain the mainstream appreciation it deserves, but its originators are finally given their flowers. Chappell Roan, who in 2025 needs no further introduction, has consistently emphasized her inspiration from drag and the painted ladies when asked about her avant-garde makeup. In Hulu's series \"Faces of Music,\" she recreates the look from her \"The Rise \u0026 Fall of a Midwest Princess\" cover and shares, \"Blue eyeshadow is so stigmatized with sex workers, drag artists, promiscuous behavior - and it's all connected to why I picked it. Everything I do is a 'f*ck you' to the box that I was so pressured to be put in and a reference to those who came before me.\" Image Source: Steve Eichner/WWD via Getty Images With every new blue liquid liner, shadow palette, or pressed glitter that comes across our Explore pages, remember that it's more than just a trend of today. Communities on the fringes laid the groundwork for it to be worn by your favorite TV characters (\"Euphoria\" anyone?) or content creator. It's an unapologetic statement of visibility, made possible by those whose contributions have largely gone unnoticed. \"Blue eyeshadow is cool because it can get reimagined every couple of years,\" says Johnson. \"It will come back sometimes as a metallic, a shimmer, or we just go back to a vintage baby blue. I hope that those over-the-top looks become a part of people wanting to be who they are and their most authentic selves walking down the street.\" Devon Preston is a social media administrator and PS Beauty contributor.
