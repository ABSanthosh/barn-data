    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. Following the last six months of industry musical chairs, another wave took place in March when it was announced that three major fashion houses were undergoing changes: Demna leaving Balenciaga to become Gucci’s new artistic director, Donatella Versace stepping down as creative director of her namesake legacy brand and Jonathan Anderson leaving Loewe after 11 years at its helm. But career changes weren’t the only headline-worthy fashion moments in March, with Paris Fashion Week providing plenty of moments that stopped the internet. Chappell Roan stepped straight from the 2025 Grammy Awards into the Rick Owens show wearing an alien-inspired, dotted face paint look complete with white contacts. Doechii made her fashion week debut with a gravity-defying blowdry at Schiaparelli, not to mention a frosted green eyeshadow look and black-lined lips for the Acne FROW. Plus, Gigi Hadid made a case for the “silver tequila” bob at the Le Grand Dîner du Louvre. For those on the hunt for even more fashion and beauty inspiration, you’ll be glad to know that April has a slew of exciting releases, launches, and products heading your way. Read ahead to take a look at all the best fashion and beauty bits coming this month.All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.Reformation x Devon Lee CarlsonFollowing drops with Laura Harrier and Camille Rowe, Reformation is back with another It Girl collaboration. This time, the brand tapped Devon Lee Carlson to design the new collection. The standout looks of the 20-piece collection include a chocolate polka dot mini dress, a '90s-inspired sky blue co-ord complete with a matching neck scarf, and a backless black lace knit dress — all made using materials like organic cotton and deadstock fabrics.Shop now at ReformationReformation x Devon Lee Carlson Cher Dress, $, available at ReformationJones Road Just Enough Tinted MoisturizerSummer is coming, and that means switching up our coverage in favor of something more warm-weather-appropriate. Jones Road (created by makeup artist Bobbi Brown) is on the case with the launch of the new Just Enough Tinted Moisturizer. Designed to conceal redness and even out the skin tone with light coverage, this product is ideal for those who don’t like to wear a lot of makeup. The silky formula minimizes the appearance of redness and hyperpigmentation without a mask-like finish and provides just enough tint for minimal makeup days. Shop now at Jones Road BeautyJones Road Just Enough Tinted Moisturizer, $, available at Jones Road\u0026 Other Stories’ Heart-filled Savoir CollectionWhen it comes to \u0026 Other Stories’ spring 2025 Savoir Collection, it’s all about love. The latest edition of the brand’s more luxurious, atelier-focused line is made up of cherry reds, blossom pinks, and pieces covered in whimsical heart, lip, and bow motifs. Find a cropped white button-front shirt with beaded detailing on the collar, wide-leg pleated trousers with delicate ties on the leg, a warm-weather-ready maxi dress with sequinned embellishments, and so much more. Shop on April 10 at \u0026 Other Stories The Ordinary Multi-Antioxidant Radiance SerumAntioxidants (think vitamin C) can offer a neutralizing and protective effect against free radicals like UV and pollution, keeping skin bright, bouncy, and smooth. But while one antioxidant is a great start, The Ordinary is now bringing eight key antioxidant ingredients together in its new Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum. Here’s why it’s beneficial: Our skin is consistently exposed to the aforementioned environmental aggressors, and these free radicals build up and lead to fine lines, dullness, and uneven skin tone. This serum works hard to prevent that from happening — and our beauty director is already a big fan.Shop now at The Ordinary and SephoraThe Ordinary Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum, $, available at SephoraBarbour x CrocsBarbour might be best known for being a favorite of the British Royal Family, but this spring, the heritage label is stepping into a more casual territory, announcing a collaboration with functional footwear brand Crocs. The limited-edition collection contains a wax jacket, two footwear styles in a tartan graphic print, and nine Jibbitz charms, bringing together the playfulness of Crocs and the practicality of Barbour. Festival season, here we come.Shop now at BarbourBarbour x Crocs Oversized Bedale Waxed Jacket, $, available at Barbour​​Dyson Supersonic r™ hair dryer in Ceramic PinkThe beauty world stood still in 2016 when Dyson brought out its first ergonomic hair dryer. Since then, the tech giant has dominated the hair space with the Coralle straightener and the highly coveted Airwrap multi-styler. Recently, the company announced that its professional Supersonic r™ hair dryer will soon be available to the public, having previously only been exclusive to salons and hairstylists. To mark the occasion, you can buy the curve-nozzled dryer in a pearly pink colorway (with a purple gemstone shade available in the summer). The Supersonic r™ is Dyson’s lightest and most powerful hairdryer, offering easier maneuverability in comparison to the original model, as well as specific attachments for straight, wavy, curly and coily hair types.Shop now at Dyson Dyson Supersonic r™ hair dryer, $, available at DysonNomasei Debuts First Stiletto HeelsParis-based footwear brand Nomasei is the label behind the fashion crowd’s favorite stylish (and comfy!) loafer, but it’s not stopping there. For the first time ever, the brand debuted stiletto heels: the Gattaca ($595), a streamlined slingback pump available in embossed white and black patent leathers, and the Before Sunrise ($651), an open-toed sandal with ankle straps also available in embossed black and white leather. According to the press release, Nomasei co-founder Paule Tenaillon was inspired by her years designing classic tango heels in Buenos Aires, where comfort and wearability were all-important. As a result, both styles (which were named for the cult ’90s films) also emphasize arch support and memory foam. Shop now at Nomasei Nomasei Gattaca Pumps, $, available at NomaseiSol de Janeiro Limited-Edition Perfume Mist CollectionIf you ask us, a new season calls for a new scent. Luckily, Sol de Janeiro is launching three fragrances this month, each with its own distinct Powerpuff Girl-esque personality. Flor Mística is spring in a bottle, thanks to notes of orange blossom, flamingo flower, and Brazilian gardenia. Água Mística is for fans of something fresh, with notes of neroli water, salty skin, and tangerine, while Dança Mística is made for the dance floor, with hints of purple fig, warm vanilla, sandalwood, and lily of the valley. Plus, the set comes with a Scent Menu —  tips on how to layer the fragrances to create your own unique combination. Shop now at Sol de JaneiroSol de Janeiro Limited Edition Perfume Mist Trio, $, available at Sol de JaneiroSANDRO x Louise BourgeoisFor the artistic among us, the announcement of Sandro’s latest collection will be joyous news to the ears. Taking inspiration from French-American artist Louise Bourgeois, the spring collection features geometric patterns. In particular, spirals feature heavily in the collection, inspired in part by the artist’s famous “Spider” sculpture. Boasting Mediterranean blues and oat milk neutrals, the collection features linen dresses, silky trousers, and cotton poplin pants — a perfect spring wardrobe.Shop on April 9 at SandroColorwow Texas Hold’em Big Hold Hairspray Colorwow's Texas Hold'em Hairspray is a perfect paradox — it delivers a strong hold yet feels like the lightest hairspray you've ever tried. It kept our beauty director’s waves intact throughout an entire day, an eight-hour night flight, and a lengthy layover in an airport, making it feel almost a shame to wash out. Even better? It offers additional heat and UV protection, shields against frizz-inducing humidity, and brushes out with ease, leaving hair feeling soft and silky, not crispy or chalky. Shop now at SephoraColorWow Texas Hold 'Em Big Hold Hairspray, $, available at SephoraMagda Butrym x H\u0026MEach H\u0026M designer collaboration is an anticipated event. Whether you’ve previously recurred a pair of Simone Rocha beaded drop earrings or a corseted Mugler dress, the collaborations offer a chance to enter the world of luxury at a much sweeter price point. For the latest collection, the Swedish giant has turned to Polish designer Magda Butrym, who has dubbed the 19-piece collection a “celebration of femininity in bloom.” From denim bustiers with 3D rose adornments to shimmering gowns with glittering floral embellishments, this collection is made for spring soirees.Shop on April 24 at H\u0026MLike what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. This isn’t a drill — Sephora’s Spring Savings Event is back, and we at R29 are buzzing with excitement. If you’re not familiar, here’s the lowdown: Depending on your Beauty Insider tier, you can score up to 20% off every purchase during the sale period. It’s the perfect chance to snag those pricey, rarely discounted products or try something new without paying full price. The sale is now open to all Beauty Insider tiers, meaning VIBs and Insiders can get 15% off and 10% off, respectively, until the sale ends. (Rouge members got first dibs on April 4 with a generous 20% off.) Plus, the retailer’s in-house label is getting some extra love with 30% off all Sephora Collection products, no matter your tier. Just use promo code SAVEMORE at checkout. Maybe the biggest note of all: There are no brand exclusions during this year’s sale, so gird your loins, prep your wishlists, and be prepared to go wild with your haul before the sale wraps on April 14. Since Sephora can sometimes feel like a dazzling maze of beauty treasures, we asked our savvy R29 editors to share the must-buys they’re adding to their carts during the event. Keep scrolling to shop them all. DashDividers_1_500x100 Shark FlexFusion™ Luxury Air \u0026 Ceramic Multi-Styler, $349 “Ever since I first reviewed the Shark FlexFusion, it’s been my ultimate hair tool obsession. It’s astonishingly user-friendly, delivers salon-quality blowouts, and dries hair in single-digit minutes. The brush attachment boosts natural bounce and volume, while the curling barrels effortlessly create soft waves (I sometimes brush through to loosen the curl a bit). There’s no better time to invest in one with a 10% discount that saves you over $30 is on the table.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Glossier You Doux Eau de Parfum, $78 “Glossier didn’t hold back with its expansion of the You cinematic universe, and I’m endlessly grateful for that bold move. This warm, woody scent has skyrocketed to the front of my fragrance collection, and I even have it in rollerball form to refresh during the day. It has subtle floral notes of violet, with sultry palo santo and ambrox (the hero ingredient in every You scent). Glossier rarely does discounts, so this Sephora sale is a rare, sneaky chance to knock a few bucks off.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Fara Homidi Smudge \u0026 Contour Lip Pencil, $36 “I’m not typically a lipstick or gloss girl, but I’m always on the hunt for the perfect everyday lip pencil to pair with a basic balm. Fara Homidi’s Smudge \u0026 Contour Lip Pencil in minky nails that natural pinky-brown nude that’s balanced and never too warm. The formula is soft, blendable, and comes in packaging that feels utterly luxe.” — Kate Spencer, Senior Affiliate Partnerships Manager Ilia Limitless Lash Lengthening Clean Mascara, $29 “ILIA’s mascara has always been a favorite of mine because it delivers a natural look without irritating my sensitive eyes. Now, with a newly-released brown shade in the mix, I’m using the Sephora sale as the perfect excuse to add it to cart.” — Kate Spencer, Senior Affiliate Partnerships Manager Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm, $24 “Every purse of mine is a graveyard for balms and glosses I’ve loved, used, and, sadly, forgotten about — except one. Summer Fridays’ Lip Butter Balm — it’s  the only product I’ve finished down to the last drop, and I keep coming back for more. I love the Iced Coffee and Hot Cocoa shades, both of which lend a wash of juicy nude that’s perfect for everyday wear. Cherry is the next hue on my list. It’s giving juicy, just-bitten glossy lips while nourishing with shea and murumuru seed butter — unbeatable!” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Luminous Powder Blush, $27 “Rare Beauty’s Soft Pinch Luminous Powder Blush brings a radiant, backlit glow to my complexion (it’s so convincingly natural, people always ask what’s my secret). It blends seamlessly (unlike most powders) and doesn’t budge until I’m ready to call it a day. I’m so smitten that I even gifted various shades to my mum and grandma. The airbrushed finish serves major smooth and plump. Plus, I love using a touch on my eyelids for a subtle, effortless glint.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Amika Reset Cleansing Oil, $30 “I’ve tried my fair share of clarifying hair products, but Amika’s Reset Range remains the gold standard for me. I started using this cleansing oil in college as a pre-shampoo treatment, and it still works wonders for banishing buildup and that greasy scalp feeling. The charcoal-infused formula transforms into oil and foams up beautifully. I go through it fast, so I’ve got my calendar marked for a discounted restock.” — Venus Wong, Senior Writer Milk Makeup Hydro Grip + Glow Illuminating Primer, $30 “I’m already an OG Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Primer stan — it locks in makeup all day, hydrates without greasiness, and creates a flawless base (sans pilling). For summer, I’m excited to give the Illuminating Grip + Glow Primer a go, which promises to prime, prep, and give my skin that lit-from-within glow.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate Writer Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, $24 “I swear by this lip sleeping mask! I keep two pots close by my side— one as the final step of my nighttime routine (waking up to baby-soft lips), and one on my desk for an on-the-go boost of softness and sticky-free shine. The Sephora Spring Sale is the time to stock up.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate Writer Chunks Medium Box Hair Claw Clip in Olive Check, $22 “If you’re hunting for a hair claw that won’t snap after a few uses, look no further — Chunks clips are elite. The AAPI-founded brand cracked the indestructible code with its FSC-certified cellulose acetate, a plant-based bio-plastic. I’m almost always rocking an updo, and these never hurt my head – this olive checkerboard print is calling my name for spring.” — Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director Ultra Violette Supreme Screen SPF Facial Sunscreen, $36 “Our beauty editors introduced me to this Australian sunscreen brand Ultra Violette, and I’ve been eager to test the Supreme Screen SPF 50 Facial Sunscreen Moisturizer and Primer for my daily SPF protection. With sun season fast approaching, I’m thrilled to add this non-greasy, no-pilling formula to my daily routine.” — Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director Merit Signature Lip Sheer Lip Liner, $24 “Lip liners are the moment, and I’m loving MERIT’s latest fleet of buttery-smooth, beginner-friendly blurring liners. They add just the right dimension without looking overdone. I’ve been defaulting to Brownstone to match my coffee-hued lip gloss for a ‘90s-inspired look, but I’m excited to get my hands on Coupé —  a soft pink that’s quite difficult to find in a shade.” — Venus Wong, Senior Writer Like what you see?

    "description": "Dove Cameron has never been one to hide her tiny tattoos. With ink dating back to when she was just 14 years old - she admitted on an episode of the \"The Drew Barrymore Show\" that she got it illegally and without parental permission - she has expanded and grown her collection of tattoos ever since and is an open book when it comes to the most intimate meanings behind each. Cameron has more than 20 known tattoos to date, including one that reads \"ride swift\" etched on the side of her hip, a design of a gun with a rose on her wrist in honor of her friend Cameron Boyce, who died at age 20 from epilepsy, and an arm tattoo in honor of her father, who passed away when she was 15. While most of her tattoos are on areas in plain sight, she has three that are usually hidden from the public eye - most of which are matching with people like her mom and sister and even past boyfriends. One is the sketch of a sunshine between her fingers that she got with her then-boyfriend, now ex, Thomas Doherty. She also has the Capricorn symbol on one hip (this is the tattoo from when she was 14) and the Gemini symbol, which is her ex Ryan McCartan's sign, on her other hip. One tattoo of Cameron's is so emotionally charged that it brought actor Dax Shepard to tears. Ahead, see the rest of Cameron's tattoos and learn what each one means.",

    "description": "Being a self-proclaimed skin-care connoisseur, I've tried my fair share of eye masks. From topicals to TikTok's favorite Grace \u0026 Stella patches, I can confidently say I know a thing or two about them. Being that beauty's entered this era of undereye patches, there's a new girl on the block who's gunning to be our favorite yet - The Summer Fridays Jet Lag Eye Patches ($24). The newest addition to the cult-favorite brand's hero line launched recently, and it's already approved by beauty lovers all over, so naturally I had to see what the hype was about.Since I've tried so many eye masks on the market, I've experienced everything from purchases that are absolutely worth it to results that brought utter disappointment (one even darkened my undereye area as opposed to brightening it). But after trying this one from Summer Fridays, I can assure you that it's one of those products that doesn't disappoint. Although I used it only once, within just 10 minutes, my eyes were super hydrated and brightened. Keep reading for my full review and find out why these masks are pushing me to retire my go-to concealer and mascara routine for a while. About the Summer Fridays Jet Lag Eye Patches They're made with ingredients like caffeine, cucumber extract, peptides, and a humectant blend of glycerin and hyaluronic acid to refresh, soothe, and de-puff the appearance of tired eyes. They're vegan, cruelty-free, and non-comedogenic. Each box comes with six pairs of patches. You typically see results within 10 to 15 minutes. You can subscribe to receive them monthly, bi-monthly, or tri-monthly, and save 15 percent each time. What I Like About the Summer Fridays Jet Lag Eye Patches What I love most about Summer Fridays's patches is that they don't slip off my face. I've experienced slipping within five minutes of applying other masks, but this product is made with nonslip hydrogel, allowing me to see real results because they actually stay on the whole time. When I first put them on, I felt a hydrating sensation that instantly absorbed into my skin, which was especially impressive being that my undereye area tends to get dry from time to time. And while wearing them didn't totally eliminate my dark circles, my eyes looked noticeably brighter and refreshed - even though I didn't get eight hours of sleep. I can tell that if I incorporated these into my daily regimen, I'd see even more of a significant difference with my undereyes. Plus, the patches are super chic and make you feel like you're getting the experience of a luxurious facial right at home. How to Use the Summer Fridays Jet Lag Eye Patches After washing your face, apply the Jet Lag patches and leave them on for 10 minutes (your undereyes must be dry first). When time is up, you can discard them and pat the remaining serum into the skin before completing your routine with your go-to moisturizer and sunscreen. In case your skin needs maximum hydration, follow up with the Jet Lag Soothing Hydration Mist ($21) and Deep Hydration Serum ($44) after using the masks. What to Consider Before Trying the Summer Fridays Jet Lag Eye Patches While these patches are a great addition to your routine, there are only six of them in each pack, so you might want to take the subscribe and save route. Also, if you have sensitive skin, it's best to do a patch test first. They contain harsh ingredients like caffeine that can cause skin irritation so it's best to be on the safe side. Where Are the Summer Fridays Jet Lag Eye Patches Available? The Jet Lag patches are available on the brand's website, at Sephora, and Revolve.
