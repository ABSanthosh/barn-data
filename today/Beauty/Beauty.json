If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. With a massive following of over 10 million on TikTok, Huda Beauty’s makeup collection is practically preordained to go viral. The latest range that has gotten the beauty community buzzing? The Huda Beauty Ube Obsession Kit, $71, featuring a setting powder, liquid blush, and lip gloss in an electric lilac shade. According to founder Huda Kattan, the lineup is inspired by her favorite tradition of indulging in ube-flavored cakes on her birthday. If you haven’t heard of ube before, here’s a quick breakdown: Ube, also known as purple yam, is a type of vegetable known for its natural violet hue and subtle sweet flavor. It’s most commonly used in pastries and desserts originating from the Philippines, like pandesal (a type of fluffy bread roll) and halo-halo (a delightful mish-mash of crushed ice, sweet beans, fruit, and ube ice cream — somewhat similar to a sundae). The ingredient has taken off in recent years as an Instagrammable food trend, and now the hype has seemingly extended across to the makeup category. The timing of this purple-hued collection feels well-considered: The term “lavender blush” blew up on TikTok last fall, and a stream of swatching videos — from creators of all skin tones — gained millions of views. People are definitely curious to know whether this pale purple color will work across the board, and that’s precisely why we’ve tapped our team of editors to put these products to the test. Ahead, we’re sharing our unfiltered thoughts on each item from Huda Beauty’s viral ube-inspired range, and whether they are actually wearable IRL. DashDividers_1_500x100 Huda Beauty Easy Bake Setting Powder in Ube Birthday Cake, $39 “Here’s the thing: I grew up thinking that purple is a color that’d never work for me. I came to this conclusion after much trial and error with purple prom dresses and lavender eye shadows, both of which added a yellow pallidness to my skin. So imagine my surprise when I dusted on a layer of the Easy Bake Setting Powder in Ube Birthday Cake, $39, and witnessed my skin become instantly brighter and more even. The powder had a slightly intimidating neon periwinkle color in the box, but on my cool-toned, light-medium skin, it added an almost imperceptible shade of icy pink. Kattan recommends applying this powder to the undereye area; doing so did fade away some of my discoloration and dullness. Packed with vitamin E and rice starch powder, the product took away my shine and set my makeup with a flattering, slightly blurred look all night. I’m so glad I gave this purple powder a chance. “I also loved the Ube Cream Blush Filter, $23, which came with a doe-foot applicator that disperses the perfectly sized tiny dot for blending. Though the blush looked lilac when I first applied it on my cheeks, it transformed into pale pink once I blended it with a brush. No complaints here, as the color looked so angelic and added a delicate flush to my cheeks. “It was by the time I swiped on the Faux Filler Gloss in UUU-Baby, $21, that I became more confused by the naming of this collection and its positioning. Don’t get me wrong: The gloss was hydrating and had an adorable milky-pink pigment, and looked so Y2K with my pale pink lip liner underneath (I used Saie’s Lip Liner 101 in French). But does it have a place in an ube-inspired collection? Not quite. “In fact, none of the products can really be categorized as ube-inspired, as they just turn into a cool pink once you’ve applied it on the skin. My friend Kristina Rodulfo — a Filipino-American beauty editor and content creator — sums it up brilliantly in Pearl, her Substack: ‘Ube in nature has more of a rich, violet hue instead of Huda’s light, pinky-pastel interpretation,’ she wrote. ‘The product description says it’s inspired by Huda’s tradition of celebrating her birthday with an ube cake every year, but it does not mention ube’s origins or the Philippines.’ In a separate Instagram video, Kattan does mention that she was first introduced to ube by the Filipino community in Dubai, but this information is not included in the press release. “Despite having good things to say about all three products, I’d personally love to see an ube collection that actually echoes the richer purple tones of the vegetable, and also gives the wider Filipino community the love they very much deserve — beyond a cute gimmick for the marketing.” — Venus Wong, senior writer DashDividers_1_500x100 Huda Beauty Blush Filter in Ube Cream, $23 “I hate how most blush shades look on my light olive skin. Pink makes me appear too ruddy-cheeked and peach tones just look off, so I have to admit that I had quite low expectations of Huda Beauty’s new Ube Cream Blush Filter. I mean, it’s lilac! In fact, I was convinced I’d try it once and relegate it to the bottom of my makeup bag. How wrong I was! This is probably the only blush shade I’ve ever truly loved on my skin. I think it makes my face look alive — and that’s no mean feat considering that it’s the height of winter, I haven’t seen the sun in months, and I have a vitamin D deficiency. Three little dots was all I needed to create this pretty pastel veil of color but you can dial it up or down depending on whether you’re feeling something subtle or bold that day. It blends like a dream, too: I used a flat foundation brush to pat it into my cheeks for a skin-like finish and it took all of a few seconds — no streaks, no craters in my foundation base. “Now on to the powder. I’m not — and never have been — a fan of baking under my eyes for fear of appearing dry and cakey, so I used this to mop up shine on my forehead and down my nose, and to set the blush in place. If your skin tone is similar to mine, don’t let the color put you off. It was like a subtle filter on my skin. It made me look matte without accentuating my parched patches and boosted the longevity of the cream blush. Don’t make the same mistake I did though: Peel the plastic cover back only half way to ensure you don’t lose any powder to the lid. “The Faux Filler Gloss is such a light pink (ube where?), it virtually swipes on clear, so it complemented my lip liner (Rhode Peptide Lip Shape in Bend, in case you were wondering) perfectly. My dry lips drank it up quickly, so it appeared more like a balm than a juicy gloss, but I’m not mad about that. Actually, I much prefer this kind of finish, and now, I’m using it in place of my lip salve.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director DashDividers_1_500x100 Huda Beauty Faux Filler Gloss in UUU-Baby, $21 “Huda Beauty is known for having some of the shiniest, longest-wearing lip glosses on the market, so it’s no surprise that my favorite out of the collection is the Faux Filler Gloss in UUU-Baby. The product didn’t feel sticky on my lips at all and left behind a beautiful sheen, but on its own, the shade looked too milky white on my medium-deep complexion for my liking. That being said, it makes the perfect lip combo when paired with a mocha brown lip liner. I typically gravitate towards wearing brown lip liners with a glossy center, as they work best with my skin tone and natural lip color, and this gloss definitely ticks that box for me. The staying power was impressive, too. While it doesn’t need constant reapplication, I like to keep it nearby in case I want an extra boost of shine. “My experience with the other Ube products was pretty mixed. I normally steer well clear of makeup in lilac hues. I’d seen rave reviews from people of various complexions, and I thought there might be a chance I’d fall in love with the products. The Ube Birthday Cake Setting Powder appeared pink on my skin tone, despite its lilac color. Some might call this brightening, but it simply looked too ashy for me — even after lots of blending. To be fair, Kattan herself does state that the powder ‘works best on medium to tan skin with golden undertones’. It’s not a product I’d reach for again; I’ll probably stick to a neutral loose powder to match my exact skin tone. “I had similar thoughts about the Blush Filter in Ube Cream, which I didn’t think worked with my medium-deep neutral skin tone. I noticed several creators mixing their Ube Cream blush with the brand’s highly popular Black Cherry shade, and it did look amazing. But personally, I believe a product should also work on its own, not just when it’s blended in with another shade!” — Vanese Maddix, freelance writer Shop the Huda Beauty Ube Collection Like what you see?

That’s how much the duo loves the Paris-based label. So, naturally, when they were ready to launch Casalina’s first fashion collaboration, they wanted it to be with Rowen Rose. Enter the new Rowen Rose x Casalina collection, which was inspired by the Amalfi Coast and the image Mize and McKinley held dear. The limited-edition capsule features five styles — all of which are red — that can be mixed and matched: a one-piece swimsuit with a keyhole cut-out, a bikini, a maxi skirt, and two vacation-ready dresses.

Essentially a type of peptide, or protein, growth factors can stimulate skin cell growth over time, boosting the collagen and elastin which naturally depletes as we age. When used in skincare, they can have promising results for fine lines, with some calling growth factors \"Botox in a bottle\" — hence why they feature in Medik8’s latest serum. Packed with Dual MiniProteins™, the serum aims to combine the \"deep penetration of peptides with the enhanced potency of proteins\" helping to support skin structure and bring back firmness to the face. Further enhanced by moisture-grabbing hyaluronic acid and a skin barrier-saving prebiotic complex, the serum is all about achieving smoother skin.Shop now at Medik8Medik8 Liquid Peptides Advanced Face Serum, $, available at Medik8RIMOWA x Rick Owens It just got even more exciting to travel with a Rimowa suitcase.

The result is a dark aged effect on the suitcases’ aluminum exterior, with each case having its own distinct finish. Plus, the interior has been upgraded to all-black leather and the suitcase is finished off with a cowhide luggage tag for a subtle touch of texture.Shop now at RIMOWARimowa x Rick Owens Cabin, $, available at RimowaCalvin Klein Returns to New York Fashion WeekCalvin Klein returned to New York Fashion Week for the first time in six and a half years!

    "title": "People Are Still Questioning If Kristen Bell's Tattoos Are Real",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/kristen-bell-tattoos-47696956",
    "description": "Image Source: Getty/Jon Kopaloff/WireImage More than a decade ago, images of Kristen Bell's tattoos began circling the internet. The ink that went viral on Twitter (now X) covered almost every area of her body, including her face. From the photos, you may have found yourself asking if the tattoos were real, and you wouldn't be alone. In fact, people are still left speculating on the matter to this day. Still, we want to be the ones to remind you that, no, they are not. We repeat: Kristen Bell's tattoo collection is nonexistent. (Although we can't say that some of those wouldn't be a good look on her.) The images in question were actually taken from an old skit that the \"Nobody Wants This\" star did with \"Funny or Die\" back in 2012, in which she reveals in a fake behind-the-scenes interview that she's actually covered with tattoos, and the reason none of her fans have ever seen them is because she uses a lot of makeup to cover them up. \"No one told me kristen bell had tattoos all over,\" one X user wrote back in December 2022. \"Is Kristen Bell the Most-Tattooed Actress?\" another headline read. Flash forward many years later, and the question came up again when the \"Nobody Wants This\" actor appeared in a \"Wired\" video to answer some of the internet's most-searched questions about her. Of course, whether Bell had any tattoos was one of them. In response, she answered that she did not but that she's always wanted to get one - much to the dismay of her husband, Dax Shepard, who is heavily tattooed himself. \"I've always wanted a tattoo, but my husband does not like girls with tattoos,\" she jokingly says in the clip. We're not sure if Bell will ever change her mind, but if her stance on tattoos does change anytime soon, there's no doubt in our minds she'll be quick to let us know. If social media is any indication, the world will be waiting. - Additional reporting by Jessica Harrington Danielle Jackson was a former assistant editor for PS Beauty.

    "description": "Curly hair comes with a unique experience than with any other hair type. Beyond the styles you can create, each curl and coil seemingly has a personality of its own, and regardless of what's been said in the past, even how you color your curls requires special care. Still, as much fun as curly hair can be, it hasn't always been as celebrated as it is today, so it's not uncommon to hear someone say that they're not exactly sure how to care for their natural texture. Like the rest of the hair-care space, there are curly hair rules that you should abide by for optimal results. The best shampoo to use based on your hair's porosity, how to properly detangle, and even what towels can disrupt your curl pattern are secrets that only a select few are privy to. Not to mention, the beauty commandments vary by curl type, too. Wavy hair is very different from coily textures. Thankfully, the landscape has started to change with the rise of natural-hair influencers and more curly-haired representation in the beauty industry. It's time for the veil of mystery to be completely lifted. We called in hair expert Eladia Lebron to create a beginner's guide of the best curly hair tips out there. Ahead, she shares how to take care of each curly hair type and explains everything from how to apply conditioner properly to how to plop your curls - no curling iron required. To learn how to style your hair once and for all, keep reading for all the best curly hair tips and tricks. - Additional reporting by Jessica Harrington Experts Featured in This Article Eladia Lebron is a master stylist and educator at Rëzo Salon in New York City.",
