If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Around the Refinery29 office, there’s one name that seems to be on everyone’s lips these days: Dr. Shereene Idriss. The board-certified dermatologist is known for her refreshingly real, unfiltered skincare advice (given occasionally from her bed, earning her the online moniker “#PillowtalkDerm,”) which she channeled into a targeted, solutions-oriented product range. (Her Major Fade Hyper Serum is a fan-favorite for showing dark spots the door.) And just in time for the dog days of winter, she’s here to diagnose your dry, chapped lips and offer the ultimate salve. (I mean, solve.) Meet the Dr. Idriss Barrier Baste Lip Basting Duo, a two-step miracle routine for your lips. The $44 duo consists of the Barrier Baste Lip Peel, a rinse-free exfoliating lip serum infused with glycerin and mandelic acid to slough off dead, crusty skin without compromising your lips’ barrier. (It’s for this reason that Dr. Idriss prefers a liquid peel over a physical scrub.) Rounding out the dynamic duo is the Barrier Baste Lip Baste, which locks in moisture and protects lips overnight thanks to ceramides, squalane, and shea butter. All in all, the concept is a bit like that scene in Ratatouille where Remy has his brother taste a piece of cheese, then a strawberry, and then combine them together for a mind-blowingly delicious result set to upbeat jazzy music. Ahead, we put the innovative new launch to the test — here’s what Refinery29 beauty editors had to say. DashDividers_1_500x100 Dr. Idriss Barrier Baste Lip Basting Duo, $44 “No matter how many lip butters, salves, and oils I hoard, nothing has been able to offer a long-lasting solution for my chronically dry lips. Balms felt nice on, sure, but I almost always felt as though the product was just sitting on top of my lips instead of being absorbed. Any hydrating or softening benefits tended to be fleeting at best, and it didn’t occur to me that the issue was that dead skin on my lips was literally getting in the way of moisturizing ingredients actually being able to do their thing. The two Barrier Baste tubes may look similar at first glance, but they are, in fact, very different formulas. The first step — the Barrier Baste Lip Peel — is not like anything I’ve ever seen. The tiny tube with a cooling rollerball applicator makes it so easy to apply a super thin layer with no mess. I let it dry for a few seconds before applying the Barrier Baste Lip Baste, which looks relatively no-frills but is easily one of the best lip balms I’ve ever tried. It’s silky and indulgent but not thick and waxy like other lip treatments I’ve tried. I applied this before bed and woke up to smoother, pillowier (I’m sorry for the non-word, it’s just the best way I can describe it!) lips the next morning. I have been repeating use about every other night since then to maintain. I can now say that my lips have their own nighttime skincare routine — and are so much happier for it.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer DashDividers_1_500x100 “When I tried Dr. Idriss’ “lip basting” hack a couple years ago (essentially treating lips with an exfoliating acid to buff away dry skin and following with a thick balm to seal it in) I was so impressed. I use glycolic acid on my face, scalp, and feet, so why didn’t I consider using it on my parched lips? After a few goes, my lips were softer and visibly smoother. Fast forward to this week and Dr. Idriss has taken her smart hack to new heights, creating a pocket-friendly lip exfoliator and lip balm duo to get the job done much more easily. I like that the Barrier Baste Lip Peel (which includes exfoliating mandelic acid) features a roller ball to take the chore out of application. Contrary to my initial thoughts, it didn’t sting (I’m prone to picking) or dry my lips out, and that’s all thanks to a heavy helping of moisturizing glycerin. Instead, it gently lifts away dry skin that I’d usually bite away. When you’ve slicked on the exfoliator, it’s time to use the balm, which is satisfyingly thick but never sticky. It feels more like a nourishing lip gloss. Happily, the balm can be used on its own, too. I’ve been carrying it inside my bag for the last few weeks as it’s freezing in London and my lips are the first to feel the cold. As you can see, there isn’t a single piece of dry skin. In fact, I’m pretty certain it’s working to plump my lips, too. Honestly? This is the second time that Dr. Idriss has saved my lips and I love her for it!” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director DashDividers_1_500x100 “As someone with perpetually flaky lips, I never go to bed without wearing at least two coats of lip balm, but they don’t always do much for my dehydrated skin. Getting rid of the little scales on my lips has become somewhat of a hyperfixation for me, and I’ve tried everything from physical lip scrubs (too harsh) to ripping them off one by one (super painful and bloody — would not recommend). This two-step treatment from Dr. Idriss therefore cannot come at a better time in my life. The Barrier Baste Lip Peel gently removes dead skin cells with mandelic acid, a chemical exfoliant also found in some of my favorite cleansers. I appreciate the minty sensation I get as I glide this across my lips, and that I don’t have to rinse anything off afterwards. Once the peel no longer feels sticky, it’s time to slather on the Lip Baste. Enriched with ceramides and squalane — both moisturizing ingredients I tend to gravitate towards in the winter — it feels like a nourishing (but not overly greasy) protective coat on the lips. I’d say that it’s far more efficient at locking in moisture and stays on the skin than your average lip mask, and I wake up with the softest, most pillowy lips. I’ve been turning to this combo the night before I’m due to wear lipstick to prep my lips, in order to make sure they have all the hydration they need.” — Venus Wong, Senior Writer Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/01/11847992/cowlick-bangs-hair-cut?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "If you were to text your best friend and ask if they have a cowlick, there is a high likelihood they would reply “Oh, let me tell you about it.” Even though most of us have learned how to hide them with a straightener or styling gel, cowlicks are everywhere — over 98 percent of the population has one. But for anyone unfamiliar, a cowlick is a small section of hair that grows differently than your other hairs, often taking on a swirl-like shape. “It can stick straight up or just lay in a completely different angle,” explains Nick Latham, one half of the London-based salon team The Hair Bros. Latham sees a lot of cowlicks in his line of work. His salon requests that clients come in with their natural hair (air-dried, not heat-styled), making it easier to identify those delightfully swirled or against-the-grain hairs. “Often, we can identify them visually, or a client will mention their cowlick,” Latham explains. Most will assume that their hairline cowlick prohibits certain hairstyles. For example, “There is a common myth that bangs and cowlicks cannot work,” says Latham. This assumption hinges on a narrow view of what a bang is and who it’s for. “In the past, where bangs were perfect — straight and very blunt — it is true, a cowlick would cause chaos,” says Latham. “But these days, where everything is softer, hair moves more, and a cowlick can work beautifully with your bangs.” According to Latham, the aspects of a cowlick that we often rage against — the texture or angling — can reinforce a bang and create a nice lift to the hair. For example, Latham references a recent client with a cowlick that “opened slightly” around her face. “We thought, why not really lean into the nuances and bends? In came this bang!” What are cowlick bangs? Every cowlick is different, thus a cowlick bang is personal. “A bang with a cowlick is actually more individual than any other,” explains Latham. What differentiates cowlick bangs from other styles — baby bangs, curtain bangs, ’70s bangs — is its movement and shape. “They are different in the sense that they will not lie flat,” adds Latham. “Instead, they have more volume and more of a bend, which can really open up an individual’s eyes and compliment features like cheekbones.” “They have more volume and more of a bend — which can really open up an individual’s eyes and compliment features like cheekbones.” To compare the cowlick bang to other bang styles, Latham says, “It is shorter, more the vibe of an actual bang as opposed to a longer, swoopier shape.” Whatever its length, a cowlick bang will often have a natural openness, exposing the forehead. “A cowlick bang can still part like a curtain bang,” Latham adds. “With a cowlick bang, we encourage embracing the nuances as opposed to wanting the hair to sit too perfectly.” How to ask for cowlick bangs The length of a cowlick bang can be tailored. But Latham’s pro tip: “Start a little longer and judge how your bang is behaving before going shorter.” As for specifics of the cowlick bangs, “We like to keep the middle of the bangs slightly blunter than normal,” explains Latham. “This adds extra weight, which will help control the bangs, and help with the day-to-day styling. Often we will keep a little more length past the corners of the eyebrows, which adds an element of versatility, especially if you want to brush the bangs back into a more 80’s-vibe blow-dry.” But what if you have curly hair? Textured hair specialist Luke Castillo says the same rules apply. “Due to the nature of the way the curly hair grows out of the scalp, curly and coily hair clients can be prone to cowlicks,” Castillo explains. “More so in curly hair, this acts as a huge advantage as it creates a natural root lift to the hair which, in turn, enhances the volume of hair.” For the cut, he uses a razor to “soften through the bangs so that the hair blends in with the cowlick,” he explains. “Another way to work with the cowlick, especially on curly hair, is to create a heavier bang or take the bang on the shorter side and make it a point of view rather than working against the cowlick.” How to style cowlick bangs This depends on your hair texture. But whatever you do, don’t be too precious with your styling. Latham recommends using a no-dent hair clip to flatten the middle of the bangs and then “bevel the edges” into a ’60s shape using a round brush. “Bear in mind that the cowlick may rise throughout the day, so don’t be too scared to go a little flatter,” he explains. “Remember also that bangs do not need to be parted in the middle, and that the beauty of a cowlick bang lays in some strands bending in slightly different directions.” “The beauty of a cowlick bang lays in some strands bending in slightly different directions.” Another great option for a fuller effect is to use a hair dryer and round brush (or a heated round brush, if you have one) and set the bangs forward and under “in three, fairly small sections,” Latham recommends. “After doing this you can brush the bangs back into an up-and-over type of movement (think Claudia Schiffer).” Before your appointment, Latham recommends looking up a few references. “Do your research with references, explain yourself and your hair thoroughly,” he advises. “But also don’t obsess too much when styling. Remember your bangs shouldn’t look the same every day.” Cowlicks are cute, let them do their thing. Like what you see?

    "description": "When it comes to sourcing new beauty inspiration, we can always count on the Grammys to introduce us to a new product or show-stopping trend. This year's ceremony not only saw the return of some old favorites - like Taylor Swift's trusted red lip and the controversial jellyfish haircut - but it also introduced us to a slew of new celeb-approved beauty products, including some affordable surprises (we're talking under $40!). While celebrity glam is more typically associated with high-end, luxury beauty products, many celebrities opted to use more budget-friendly products for their Grammys 2025 looks. Cynthia Erivo used a $5 eyeliner to create her decadent, mocha-hued eye contour; Charli XCX tamed her voluminous curls with the help of a $9 styling creme; and even Miley Cyrus relied on an $11 lip tint to perfect her award-show pout. Ahead, we rounded up the best affordable beauty products under $40 that music's biggest stars relied on for the 2025 Grammys. From drugstore favorites to hair-care staples and plenty of editor-approved skin-care products in between, these beauty must haves will make it easy to achieve an A-list glam - even if you're on a budget.

    "description": "Anyone who uses TikTok is most likely aware that the platform is home to some pretty wild claims. Whether it's users saying that showering with the toilet open causes acne or people recommending hemorrhoid cream to get rid of under-eye bags, out-of-the-box ideas are never hard to come by. I've made it my personal mission to mythbust as many of them as I possibly can, which usually involves chatting with dermatologists and other beauty experts in the industry. Last year, when I saw a few videos going viral on the platform claiming that Vaseline works better than mascara - with some pretty convincing video evidence to go with it - my first question was whether or not it was safe. After speaking with a handful of ophthalmologists who confirmed that using occlusives like Vaseline, Aquaphor, and petroleum jelly near the eyes was safe as long as they weren't getting directly in the eye, I decided I needed to try it out. Plus, \"ghost lashes\" are currently trending right now, which is a fancy way of saying eyelashes without mascara, and I figured this would be a great way to test out the pared down look all while using a fuck hack. @mar.hacks Invisible mascara hack!! #makeup #makeuptutorial #beauty #beautyhack #hacksbymar #makeupartist #makeuphacks #makeuplook #mascara #mascarahacks #eyelashes #beautytips #beautytok #AmazonMusicProudHeroes #MakeNightsEpic #CatchChobaniOatmilk #vaseline #vaselinehacks #beautytutorial ♬ Aesthetic - Tollan Kim I have short, stubby lashes. If you're staring at me head-on, chances are you won't even know my eyelashes exist. When I'm putting on makeup, I typically curl them and layer on mascara like my life depends on it. No matter what kind of product I use - I've even tried waterproof formulas - my lashes fall flat by the end of the day. Not to mention, I'm constantly dealing with fallout, flakes, and clumps from the thick coating I have on. When I first decided to try this hack for myself, I was a little nervous. I wasn't sure if the Aquaphor would be too heavy on my lashes, and to be honest, despite getting approval from a doctor, I was still a little freaked out that I was going to get an eye infection. Luckily, neither of those things happened. I've been using this hack for the last few months and it's completely changed the game for me. The only time I wear mascara is if I'm going out for the night, but otherwise, it's completely replaced my need for the product - especially in my day-to-day life. Doing the hack is easy. I start by taking my tube of Aquaphor ($6) and squeezing a tiny bit onto the back of my hand. (I always make sure to wash my hands first.) Then, I curl the eyelashes on both of my eyes with the Kevyn Aucoin Eyelash Curler ($26). From there, I take a clean spoolie (I use one from an eyebrow product that I've never used), dip it in the Aquaphor, and gently coat my lashes with a tiny bit of the formula. Then, I take a different spoolie to make sure everything is spread out evenly, and I go over my eyelashes with the curler one more time. Not only does this hack curl my lashes better than any other mascara or trick I've tried, but the curl actually lasts all day long - even when I rub my eyes. Honestly, the only thing that gets the curl to fall is when I use a cleanser to wash my face at the end of the night. This is hands down the best hack I've ever learned from TikTok because it's made my life so much easier. I can look put together in a minute flat just by doing this to my eyelashes, and I constantly have people asking me if I got a lash lift. Now, if only Aquaphor would make a version of this product with eyelash-conditioning ingredients, I'd be set for life.
