    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/noyz-body-mist-fragrance-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "ICYMI, body mists have very much re-entered the chat. What used to be a teenage beauty staple has emerged as one of the fastest-growing categories in fragrance. It’s not hard to see why body mists have received so much love on TikTok: they present a low-commitment and affordable way to trial a scent — something many perfumes don’t offer. You have your OG players like Bath \u0026 Body Works and Victoria’s Secret, while viral hits from the likes of Phlur and Sol de Janeiro have added even more momentum to the comeback. But among the sea of body sprays that will make you smell like tropical fruit punch and sugary desserts, there’s one editor-favorite brand that has unveiled something decidedly edgier and more grown-up. Enter: Noyz. Our love for Noyz perfumes is well-documented. (We recently coined its Detour Eau de Parfum as the scent for 2025’s festival season.) The indie fragrance brand’s latest launch is a trio of body mists created by famed French perfumer Jérôme Epinette, the nose behind many iconic scents from Byredo to Floral Street. They’re just as interesting and complex as the brand’s eaux de parfum — only breezier, more affordable, and far more wearable for summer. Ahead, three R29 beauty editors each picked their favorite from the lineup. DashDividers_1_500x100 Noyz Listen, Honey Hair \u0026 Body Fragrance Mist, $42 “I am not speaking from personal experience here, but I can only imagine that Listen, Honey smells like what it felt like to be popular in high school. It reminds me of an elevated version of the beloved Victoria’s Secret body mists, which is to say that it’s sexy, feminine, but also a little unexpected. Personally, I find that gourmand scents can go from delicious to overpowering very quickly, but Noyz has really nailed the blend of honey, caramelly notes with amber, jasmine, and cardamom for a hint of spice. It lingers beautifully on my skin, hair, and clothes all day, and lasts longer than most other body sprays I’ve tried. It’s warm and sensual, but not heady whatsoever. Plus, the 8.1 fluid ounce bottle will last me ages before having to repurchase.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer Noyz Salty Hair \u0026 Body Fragrance Mist, $42 “The office erupted in compliments when Venus sprayed this last week, and I think that tells you everything you need to know about this body mist. I was thrilled to be the one taking it home to test. Beachy fragrances are my go-to; anything that smells like sipping a piña colada while wrapped in a sun-warmed towel after a dip in the ocean gets my vote. This one’s fresh, thanks to pink sea salt and marine accord — like sea spray in the air — but golden waterlily and pineapple add a lusher, lightly floral edge. Salty reminds me so much of Floral Street’s Arizona Bloom, but it’s a touch more wearable — lighter, airier, and perfect for hot, humid days when you want to feel (and smell) clean but not soapy. While the staying power isn’t as impressive as the brand’s eau de parfum range, it sticks around much longer than most mists I’ve tried. I can’t get enough.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director Noyz Juicy Chaos Hair \u0026 Body Fragrance Mist, $42 “I normally steer clear of citrus scents since I find the smell too similar to cleaning products, but Juicy Chaos surprised me in the best way. By injecting spicy ginger extract and earthy vetiver into the mix, perfumer Jérôme Epinette has managed to capture the energizing aspects of Spanish orange and mandarins while giving it dimension. There’s a slightly bitter zestiness to the scent — like biting on an orange rind straight from the fridge — which makes it refreshing without being too basic or saccharine. After the juicy top notes fade, the grounding moss and warm amber keep you company for the rest of the day. The dry-down unfolds with the nuance of a high-end eau de parfum, which makes this an absolute steal at $42. If you’re the type of sophisticated adult that stocks your bathroom with hand wash from Aesop or Malin + Goetz, this one is very much up your street.” — Venus Wong, senior writer Shop Noyz’s body mist collection Like what you see?

    "description": "Call it the Labubu-fication of beauty, but it seems like the most covetable bag charm might already be sitting at the bottom of your purse. Lip balms-turned-keychains are everywhere right now  — and show no signs of trending down. From clever add-ons that transform your favorite tube into an accessory to teeny-tiny charms made just for your go-to products, we’re collectively living quite the charmed life these days.  But it’s not just about squeezy tubes. Logo keychains — including the “bootleg” kind found on Amazon and Etsy — for brands like Bubble, Dior, and Glossier have become modern-day collectibles. Repping your favorite sports team or designer label? That’s cute. But we’ll take a plush Tatcha fob, thank you very much. With everyone from drugstore to prestige brands getting in on the beauty charm game, scroll on to see which ones R29 editors are adding to their purses, keychains, belt loops, and beyond. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Ordinary The Lip \u0026 Lash Set, $17 “When The Ordinary announced it was entering the lip category with the Squalane + Amino Acids Lip Balm, I was positively giddy. I knew whatever they launched would have that signature The Ordinary focus on ingredients and innovation. Sure enough, this has become one of my favorite balms — especially now that she lives on my keys! The texture is lighter than some of the others I use, which I actually prefer for daytime. (My husband also loves it.) It’s teeny enough to fit in the palm of my hand, and the little tear drop shape pops in a sea of squeezy tubes.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer  Bubble Tell All Lip Balm, $9 “This adorable pill-shaped balm is so cute I almost didn’t want to use it. It lives on my work backpack, so whether I’m at the office or a coffee shop, I know I’ve got a balm on hand. I’m partial to the mint flavor —  it’s refreshing and cooling, especially on a hot day. Unlike some of the other lippies in this bunch, it’s not tinted and doesn’t have a glossy finish; it’s just a lip balm — but a really good one.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer  Dior Addict Lip Glow Butter, $42 “Whenever I pull this balm out of my bag, people flock — and I think the dainty Dior charm has something to do with it. A friend of mine even attached hers to her car keys, and I’m obsessed. But it’s not just about looks. The formula is packed with skin-strengthening peptides and moisturizing ceramides, plus cherry oil for a glossy, non-sticky finish. My favorite shade is Black Cherry — a muted merlot that looks amazing with a darker lip liner. It’s replaced my Rhode Peptide Lip Tint in Raspberry Jelly (which says a lot).” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Glossier Balm Dot Com Keychain, $18  “I’ve never had Magnolia Bakery’s famous banana pudding, but do I need to? This is the tastiest lip balm I own — I can’t get enough. Dry lips? Don’t know them (that’s the magic of castor oil, beeswax, and lanolin). The keychain, complete with a bunch of bananas and a screw-on metal cap, makes it even better. It’s cutesy, kitsch, and exactly the kind of fun my bag was missing.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Fenty Beauty Smurfette Effect Gloss Bomb + Keychain, $22 “This gloss is giving major nostalgia in the cutest way. The formula is everything you’d expect from Fenty—juicy, non-sticky, and super flattering—but it’s the Smurfette keychain charm that sealed the deal for me. It’s playful, collectible, and perfect for tossing on your bag or keys so you’re never without a little gloss (and a lot of cuteness).” — Sara Tan, Global Beauty Director tarte x Dunkin’ Maracuja Juicy Shimmer Glass Lip Plump + Free Charm, $27 “I love Dunkin’, and I love Tarte — so this collab felt like it was made just for me. (It wasn’t.) Like the rest of TikTok, I count the Maracuja Lip Plump as one of my most-used lip products for its hydrating, glossy, and subtle plumping properties. This rosy mauve looks great on everyone —  alone for a hint of tint or layered over liner for a lip combo moment. I didn’t think the formula could be improved… and then they added a tiny golden Dunkin’ cup charm. Now it’s a collector’s item. ” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer  Cocokind Ceramide Lip Blur Balm Hydrating \u0026 Smoothing Lip Treatment, $11.99 “I recently wrote a story about “blurred” makeup, which led me to try this balm. The tint payoff is spot on, the shades are universally pretty, and it feels plush and hydrating — there’s truly not a meh one in the bunch. It’s also one of the more affordable ones I’ve tried. I clip it onto a carabiner or my jumbo Baggu key chain.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/twist-clip-hair-editor-experiment-48908792",
    "description": "I am a minimalist at heart. I love simple outfits, easy makeup, and hairstyles that take little to no effort. While I occasionally find myself going all out with my looks, more often than not, you can find me doing the bare minimum, especially when it comes to my hair. I only wash it twice a week at most, which means I only style it twice a week as well. I typically give myself a blowout, but in the summer months when the weather is warmer, I try to give my hair a break from heat as much as possible, which often leaves me searching for different heatless hair methods. I recently stumbled across a video of Dianna Cohen, the founder of hair-care brand Crown Affair, showcasing her \"twist and clip\" method for air-drying her hair. In the video, Cohen utilizes two hair clips to give herself heatless waves that look incredible. When I heard her describing her method as the \"no-makeup-makeup vibe for hair,\" I knew I needed to test it out for myself. @crownaffairhq Our Founder, @Dianna Cohen, shares her technique for heatless waves using our haircare favorites as well as our newest launch, The Clips. #clawclip ♬ original sound - Crown Affair To test the hack, the only things I needed were two small clips. Then, after washing my hair and hopping out of the shower, I wrapped it in a microfiber towel to soak up some of the moisture. After about 20 minutes, once my hair was damp but mostly dry, I took it out of the towel and applied my favorite leave-in conditioner, the Gisou Honey Infused Leave-In Conditioner ($34). I also applied the Gisou Honey Infused Hair Oil ($25). After combing everything through with a wide-tooth comb and dividing my hair into my normal middle part, it was time to test out Cohen's hack. I started by dividing my hair into two sections, the top half being one section and the bottom half being the other. From there, I took the top half and began twisting small sections on either side back into tiny rope-like hair twists. I then clipped them together. The final step was to take the bottom half of my hair and divide it into two sections, and then twist them in a backward motion the same way I did with the top. I ended by clipping the bottom sections together just as I did with the top half. While it might sound confusing, trust me: it's easy to master. It wasn't until I tested it out for myself after watching Cohen do it in her TikTok videos that I realized just how simple it was. After letting my hair sit for about 30 minutes, I took out the clips and released my hair. The twist-and-clip method left me with soft waves that gave me tons of bounce - my curtain bangs even had a perfect swoop to them. I've tested this hack quite a few times since my initial run, and I've found there are a few key things that help my hair look its best. To start, I add in a wave spray or a beach spray after my leave-in conditioner. I've found that it gives my hair more texture and helps the style stay in place for a longer period of time. I like to finish things off with the Crown Affair Finishing Hair Spray ($38), which is a previous Popsugar Beauty Award winner. I have fine hair that falls between straight and wavy, so this hack would probably work best for people with similar textures that need a little help enhancing a curl. It definitely achieved that for me - it was easy to do and made my hair look cute with minimal effort. Ever since stumbling upon Cohen's video, I've been utilizing this method a lot, and I don't plan to stop anytime soon. Renee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/nano-brows-before-after-49400175",
    "description": "There was once a time when I had glorious eyebrows. Dark, full, glossy - really, my only complaint was that they had a bit of a Frida Kahlo vibe toward the middle. It was nothing some strategic tweezing couldn't handle. I'd also clean up the strays below the browline, but I was never one to overpluck. And yet one day in my 30s I looked at a photo of myself and realized my brows had sort of . . . disappeared. No longer dark or bushy, they were now just sparse and gappy. I had no idea what had happened. I got my thyroid checked. (Healthy, whew.) My derm prescribed Latisse. (It did nothing.) My friends and family reassured me that the brow loss was hardly noticeable. I appreciated their kind words, but my sad, sparse brows were all I saw when I looked in the mirror. So I learned to fill them in with brow products like powders and pencils and fiber gels. Every day, I'd wake up and draw on my brows; it didn't matter if I was going to the gym, the beach, on a hike. It felt very high maintenance, but I refused to be seen without made-up arches. I considered microblading, but it seemed so permanent. What if I hated the shape? What if the color faded from dark brown to a weird purple color over time (like an old black T-shirt)? Also, I heard it hurts, and I'm allergic to pain. Plus, everyone had an opinion: \"It's like a bad tattoo on your face, why would you do that?\" \"Penciling in your brows is cheaper!\" And then there were my doom searches for \"microblading gone wrong\" - the results didn't exactly inspire confidence. But then I heard about the nano brow technique, or nanoblading. As I quickly learned, there is no blade involved, and I was immediately intrigued. Keep reading to hear about my experience. Experts Featured in This Article Michelle Wu is a master therapist at Evertrue Microblading Salon. Nano Brow vs. Microblading The treatment is similar to microblading, in that pigment is deposited and absorbed into the top layer of your skin (the epidermis) in brush-like strokes. However, where a microblading specialist uses a tool with 14 tiny blades to manually apply the pigment, nano brow is done with an electric pen that holds a single needle. Because of this, there's less pain, less bleeding, more accuracy, and shorter downtime. Like microblading, nano brow treatments can be done on any skin color and in a shade that blends with any brow color. The single-needle accuracy also makes nano brows the treatment of choice for people who are prone to bleeding or have sensitive skin, or specific skin conditions such as oily skin, large pores, or laxity. The results look more \"crisp\" than microbladed brows, explains Michelle Wu, master therapist at Evertrue Microblading Salon (where I ended up). Crisp was fine, but I was really looking for \"no pain\" and \"accuracy,\" so this all seemed very promising. Results for both treatments are expected to last six to 18 months, but I was told nano brows could last as long as 24 months. (Fun tip: don't use retinoids on treated brows, as topicals that increase cell turnover can make the pigment disappear faster.) How Much Do Nano Brows Cost? It's certainly not cheap. The treatment starts at $1,050, as compared to $650 for microblading. The time commitment aligns with the cost: nano brows can take two-and-a-half to three hours, while microblading takes one-and-a-half to two hours. The single blade may be more precise, but that means the process is slower. There's also a common optional add-on for both treatments called \"microshading\" (roughly $200), which is a stipple-like process that adds definition and looks more like brow powder than individual hairs. For some people, adding on microshading is more of an aesthetic preference. But, for example, if you have dark brow hairs in some places but not others, it can help even things out visually. Ultimately, nano brows felt like they could be for me and I decided to try them. My Nanoblading Eyebrow Consultation I booked my consultation at Evertrue Microblading Salon in NYC and met with a senior specialist named May. She listened as I shared my tale of brow woes, paying close attention as I showed her photos from a few years back when my brows were still living their best Italian-American life, along with a pic from high school before I ever picked up a tweezer. She took a few \"before\" photos, then had me lie down so she could use a fine brow pencil to sketch out what my nano brows would look like. She drew tiny, hair-like strokes over the few brow hairs I had left, explaining what she was doing as she went. We agreed that my new brows should be closer together over my nose than they currently were, and that overall the shape should also be thicker (especially based on my old pictures). She suggested the tapered ends be just a bit higher than they naturally are; when I took a look at her finished results in the mirror, I agreed. Nano Brows Before and After Photos My brows looked great: dark, full, clean. And true to their natural state, they were not fully symmetrical. I've always known my brows were sisters, not twins, and May honored that while making sure they still framed my face. She suggested that I also get microshading as an add-on in order to better integrate the bald (ugh) parts of my brows with the hairier areas. I was ready. I booked my three-hour nano brow appointment followed by a one-hour microshading chaser, and left happy and hopeful. The Nano Brow Treatment Four hours is a long time to lay on your back while someone messes with your face. I wasn't sure how I would tolerate it. But I dressed comfortably and brought a protein bar and water since May promised we could take breaks. She applied numbing gel to both brows, waited 20 minutes, then got to work. Since my eyes were closed the whole time, I can only tell you what I felt and heard. The nano brow pen sounded like a dentist's drill, high-pitched and annoying at first, but it quickly became neutral background noise. Thanks to the numbing gel, the electric needle pen carving hair-shaped slices over my brow bone felt like nothing more than a fingernail gently (yet repeatedly) dragging across my skin. The biggest sensation I felt during the entire session was the periodic pressure of May's gloved fingers wiping away excess ink. (Confession: at the moment, I totally feared it was blood and got a little panicky. Since I'm a people pleaser, I said nothing. But I emailed the salon after the fact and was told nope, just ink.) I couldn't even tell you when the nano brow work ended and the microshading began - that's how painless the whole thing was. When I was finally done, May handed me the mirror . . . and I had eyebrows. They were a little thicker than we discussed, but she had already told me that they'd shrink as they healed. Likewise, at first, they were darker than they would eventually turn out to be. My Nano Brow Recovery Experience I left with a bunch of easy-to-follow instructions: don't get brows wet (rain, tears, sweat - nothing) for 24 hours; don't get makeup or sunscreen near them for the next week (the chemicals and minerals could alter the color of the pigment until the skin is fully healed); and avoid facials, retinols, and other intensive skincare products for two weeks. That was a Wednesday. My brows looked amazing. The next few days I rolled out of bed and went straight to the mirror, admiring my full, dark brows. Then I packed and left on a vacation to Ireland, where I woke up shocked on day five: my brows were peeling, but not at all in the way I expected them to. You see, when May told me to expect peeling as the traumatized skin shed and new skin grew beneath it (basically like a scab), I expected something like retinoid or sunburn peeling - white, flaky, dry skin. I figured it would be annoying but manageable and not too noticeable, especially with the tiny pot of healing balm she gave me. Instead, I was peeling in dark-pigmented flakes - and the skin left behind was quite obviously lighter. I looked like I was molting. Cute, right? It took everything in me not to take a clean spoolie brush and scrub at my flaking brows. May had warned that rushing the process could result in uneven pigment saturation, and I definitely didn't want that. Instead, I gently splashed water and mild cleanser on my brows when I washed my face, and made peace with what I called my zebra arches. Happily, after a few days, the shedding was over, and I was rewarded with beautiful, natural-looking brows. Why I Love My Nano Brows After four weeks, I booked a microshading touch-up since there were a few spots that didn't look perfectly blended. This time I was only at Evertrue for two hours, and when I hopped off the table, I gave May a big hug. I was so happy with my brows. I went home and dramatically threw all my brow makeup in the trash. May told me the salon would automatically follow up in six months for a touch-up appointment but that I probably wouldn't need it for a year or more. Honestly, every single day has been a big, beautiful brow gift. I'll take it as long as it lasts. For me, the result is perfect. My brows look natural, with a subtle lightness at the insides that gets darker toward the outer tips. Even better, I had to remind my partner and friends that I'd even had the treatment done - they didn't notice anything different about me. All they saw was me, and now when I look in the mirror, that's all I see too.
