Made by just a two person team, developer Pounce Light has crafted a simple and charming gameplay loop: make, create, and arrange castles, villas, or cottages to your liking using the game's flexible building system. It may be cozycore on the surface, but there's plenty of bespoke stuff driving its warm pastel aesthetic, including ray-traced global illumination (RTGI), ray-traced reflections and loads of procedural tech. Impressively, it all runs really well on near-decade-old GPUs too. RT on a GTX 1060? Believe it. Read more",

    "description": "Better strap in folks, this killer thriller has a few twists in the tale. Shadows of Doubt is, on paper, my dream game, a detective simulator where you solve procedurally generated crimes through a combination of Obra Dinn-esque deduction and Deus Ex style infiltrations.

The problem? Hadea is a hermit state. The only reason why Rémi lives outside of its borders is thanks to his mother, who smuggled him out when he was five. Unfortunately, she was caught by the Hadea border control, leaving him alone and eventually entering the Canadian foster system. Her capture, and the fact that his father was a blacksmith in a village called Jova, are the only things he truly remembers from his short time in Hadea. It's due to this that Rémi, despite understanding the rationality behind his parents actions, wants to reunite with them and learn exactly why they got him out. Read more",

    "description": "A new DF Direct Weekly lands - as usual - today, with the team's thoughts on the recent State of Play, reaction to the most recent RTX 5080/5090 leaks and, perhaps inevitably, more PlayStation 5 Pro. However, it's actually a point raised in last week's Direct that I want to tackle in this week's blog. Many believe - with some justification - that the PS5 Pro is a step too far and that such a console isn't needed. In fact, we've made the argument ourselves. Looking back at that piece, I warned about higher costs of a Pro console, but also looked at the potential improvements it could bring - all of which have come to pass with PS5 Pro. Microsoft declined the opportunity to follow likewise, but now we have some idea of why Sony has taken a different route and perhaps more of the strategy is now understandable. Read more",

Of course, that's by no means cheap, and it's a lot more than previous Grado models I've looked at, such as the lovely SR325x. I've been using the Hemps for the last few weeks to see if they're worth that higher price. Read more",

Preorders weren't supposed to start until October 3, but the PS5 controller went live earlier tonight at Amazon and Walmart. Amazon, at least for now, is sold out of units. The Fortnite-themed PlayStation controller launches November 7, but it'll probably be sold out at all major retailers long before then. Fortnite Limited-Edition PS5 DualSense Wireless Controller $85 | Releases November 7 It has a blue color scheme and graffiti-style decals inspired by the game. The Fortnite controller certainly stands out with a chaotic design that's the complete opposite of the recently released Astro Bot DualSense.Aside from the Fortnite theming, the controller is otherwise the same as other standard DualSense controllers, complete with features like haptic feedback, dynamic triggers, touchpad, and gyro controls. PlayStation recently raised the price of DualSense controllers by five bucks, and the Fortnite controller reflects this change with an $85 list price. The Astro Bot controller only costs $80 (if you can find it), probably because preorders were already available when the increase went into effect. Going forward, limited-edition DualSense controllers will likely cost $85. Preorder at Walmart Preorder at Amazon Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "October Is Thankfully Stacked With New Horror Games",
    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/october-is-thankfully-stacked-with-new-horror-games/2900-5825/",
    "description": "Halloween has stretched to become a month-long celebration for many people, with many seeking to play new horror games, discover the best horror movies, and eat pumpkin-flavored treats. We already have a list of the best horror games to play in 2024, and it's loaded with a few-dozen timeless classics, newer hits, and everything in between. But if you're like me, and your horror backlog is painfully short because you're all caught up on the genre, don't worry. October 2024 is going to be a good, busy month for new horror games. We've rounded up all the major releases you can expect in the genre this month, which is a scarier sibling gallery to our broader list of October 2024 new video game releases in general.The horror games you see below are listed in order of release date, so if you're really diligent, you can keep up day by day, week by week. If you're in need of even more horror content, don't miss the best horror games on Game Pass and the best zombie games. On the movie side, we have a list of the best vampire movies, the best movies set on Halloween, and a list of horror movies that, for some reason, went to outer space. If you don't mind Scream spoilers, we've even ranked every Ghostface. Moving Houses - October 1Platforms: PCDon't let the cheerful imagery fool you. Moving Houses may look like a happy home redecorator sim, but it hides a much more somber side to it that comes to the surface the deeper you go. That twist is both teased in trailers and alluded to in the developer's tweets, so we're comfortable saying it here. Plus, we find such a rug-pull to be especially effective in the horror genre. If you agree, this one is out on Steam now with positive reviews. See on Steam Predator: Hunting Grounds - October 1Platforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5Illfonic is no stranger to licensed horror and horror-adjacent games, having previously worked on other games like Friday The 13th, Ghostbusters, and Killer Klowns from Outer Space. Predator predates all of those, and it's recently been given renewed life on modern consoles. The 4v1 multiplayer game casts the titular hunter extraordinaire against a pack of soldiers meant to kill the being. How that turns out is up to you and your friends. See on Steam Until Dawn - October 4Platforms: PC, PS5The re-release of Supermassive's best cinematic horror story is being labeled a remake despite seeming to be more like a remaster, but whatever you call it, it should make for a great Halloween-season game whether you've played it before or not. These choose-your-own-adventure style games are great in small groups where different players can be assigned caretaking duties for different characters. Can you get your ward out of this story alive? See on Amazon Silent Hill 2 Remake - October 8Platforms: PC, PS5Perhaps the biggest game on this list, Silent Hill 2 follows a run of horror remakes like Resident Evil 2, 3, 4, and Dead Space, that have set a high bar, and the world is waiting to see if Bloober Team can keep the winning streak alive. It'll be no easy feat, as the original game is often considered among the best in the genre's storied history, but with some of the original team assisting on the project, we remain hopeful. See on Steam Amanda The Adventurer (Xbox and PlayStation Launch) - October 10Platforms: Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Xbox One, PS4 PC and Switch gamers may have already experienced the unique horrors of this twisted take on a children's TV show, but if you're waiting to play it on other platforms, your wait is almost over. The game blends bits of first-person exploration and puzzle-solving with point-and-click mechanics when you're inside the titular learning program. Think of it as Dora The Explorer… only with murder. See on Steam DayZ Frostline Expansion - October 15Platforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5DayZ is expanding again; this time it's getting chillier with the winter-themed map, Sakhal, an archipelago that succumbed to the same zombie plague that the rest of the DayZ universe has suffered. The winner-takes-all ruthlessness of DayZ seems well-suited for a snowy region where keeping warm is likely to be a greater concern. Bundle up! See on Steam A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead - October 17Platforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5There hasn't been much talk of this one despite it being just a few weeks out at the time of writing this, but if you like the movies, this first-person shush-or-die horror game could be a fun companion piece, offering a new storyline featuring new characters not seen in the movies. See on Amazon RetroRealms Halloween and Ash vs. Evil Dead - October 18Platforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Xbox One, PS4, SwitchBoss Team Games is teaming with WayForward, one of the best 2D game developers going right now, for this unexpected series of horror platformers. Halloween and Ash vs. Evil Dead are the first two of at least four IP to be represented in this horror museum of a sort, with the next two still to be revealed. If these first entries do well commercially, Boss Team has plans to continue bringing in more iconic horror characters, leading perhaps to an eventual Scary Smash Bros. vibe. See on Steam No More Room In Hell 2 - October 22Platforms: PCLeft 4 Dead-likes are bountiful, especially on PC, but this sequel to a somewhat under-heralded game inspired by L4D ups the ante in a few ways. For one, if it's like the original, it's much harder than typical Left 4 Dead. It's also played in eight-player co-op rather than four, which seems to reinforce that earlier claim about difficulty. If I need seven allies to fend off zombies, things seem to have really gotten out of hand. See on Steam Forest Hills: The Last YearPlatforms: PCThe next asymmetrical horror PvP game is on the way. Forest Hills: The Last Year is sort of a reboot of an arguably cursed game that first launched exclusively in the short-lived Discord games store, before later being moved to Steam after its momentum had vanished. Now, rebuilt in a new engine with a team that feels it's ready to bring the game into the limelight of a competitive genre, the third time may be the charm. See on Steam The Axis Unseen - October 22Platforms: PCDeveloped by a former Bethesda dev, The Axis Unseen is a first-person survival-horror and hunting game in which you track and kill strange mythical beasts. It's also inspired by the heavy metal genre, and it seems like there's a lot of overlap between the horror and metal fandoms, so this one is sure to become some people's whole personality for a while after it launches. See on Steam Post Trauma - October 29Platforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Xbox One, PS4Post Trauma is an interesting blend of old and new ideas from the horror genre. Its gameplay is presented by way of fixed camera angles akin to classic PS1 and PS2 horror games, but its visuals reject the popular retro aesthetic in favor of a high-fidelity modern look. Like a lot of games of this sort, success will ultimately come down to how scary it is and how rewarding its exploration feels, but a new game going for that classic approach with a fresh coat of paint is an intriguing starting point. See on Steam Clock Tower Rewind - October 29Platforms: PS5, PS4, Switch, MobileThe Clock Tower series has been dormant for a long time, but now its return will be marked with a reset, in a sense. Clock Tower Rewind is a re-release and somewhat modernized version of the very first game in the series. The 2D horror game predates basically every other horror series you may know by name, so even if the 2D style isn't your thing, there's a historical case for checking this one out. See on Steam Alan Wake 2 - The Lake House Expansion - October TBDPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5Nearly a year to the day since the game launched, Alan Wake 2's second (and presumed final) expansion is coming this month, though no release date has yet been specifically circled on the calendar. In The Lake House, it seems players will take on the role of yet another new playable protagonist, with Special Agent Estevez filling that role after the base game and first expansion combined for five playable characters. For Remedy Connected Universe devotees, expect this to be another must-play chapter with as many questions as it has answers. See on Amazon",

    "description": "Lego Super Mario: NES and CRT TV Set $255 (was $270) See at Amazon See at Target The Lego Nintendo Entertainment System set is a lot of fun to build and looks great as a retro display piece, but it's also quite pricey. The $270 set released over four years ago, but like many Nintendo games, you wouldn't know it based on its stagnant price at major retailers. Plus, even at full price, the NES and CRT TV model set is often sold out. But if you've been waiting for an excuse to finally pick up the 2,646-piece set, you can save a bit of cash at Amazon and Target ahead of Prime Big Deal Days and Circle Week. The Lego NES is on sale for $255 at both retailers, which is only 15 bucks off, but it's something at least. You can also take advantage of rare (and better) discounts on the Piranha Plant and Mighty Bowser Lego sets.Lego Nintendo Entertainment System (2,646 Pieces)Lego Nintendo Entertainment System with CRT TV, NES controller, and Super Mario Bros. cartridgeLego's take on Nintendo's iconic console doesn't just include a buildable version of the machine, it also throws in all the pieces you'll need to build an old-school CRT TV and stand, NES controller, and a Super Mario Bros. NES cartridge as well. The end result is an intricate display piece., full of interactive elements like a working cartridge slot, rotating dials on the CRT TV, and a crank-operated screen that emulates a Super Mario level. It also has a very charming secret that will delight long-time fans.If you thought this Lego set could be purchased for less than $270 at one point, you'd be correct. Released in 2020 with a launch price of $230, the Lego NES was one of many sets that received substantial price hikes in 2022. For the past two years, the Lego NES has remained at its $270 price--when it's available to purchase at all. Major retailers--sometimes all of them--are constantly sold out of the Lego NES.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

That film was one of Smith's first blockbusters as a leading man, but he left another impression on director Barry Sonnenfeld. According to Sonnenfeld, one fart from Smith was enough to make the entire crew temporarily evacuate the Men in Black set.Sonnenfeld shared the anecdote while he was a guest on Kelly Rippa's SirusXM podcast, Let's Talk Off Camera. During the scene where Smith's Agent J and Jones' Agent K were driving upside down the Midtown tunnel, they had to be hermetically sealed into the fake car on set. That's when Smith accidentally let a fart rip while he and Jones were stuck inside.\"I hear Will Smith go, 'Oh, Jesus, so sorry. Tommy, so sorry. Baz, get the ladder,'\" recalled Sonnenfeld. \"And you hear Tommy saying, 'That's fine, Will. No worries, Will. Don't worry, Will.'\"Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Inspired by Avengers: Age of Ultron, this set originally retailed for $550, but you can add the Lego Hulkbuster to your collection for only $300 ahead of Prime Big Deal Days. It's worth noting that the set has consistently sold for around $400 throughout 2024, so the $250 overall savings isn't reflective of recent trends. Still, you're getting one of the largest Lego Marvel sets for $85 less than you would at the Lego Store and other retailers.Before Lego released the staggering 5,201-piece Avengers Tower last holiday, the Hulkbuster owned the distinction of being the largest Marvel Lego set by piece count. .

    "description": "In 2007, Blizzard Entertainment began working on Titan, a MMO that the company hoped could replicate the success of its earlier title, World of Warcraft. Seven years later, Blizzard acknowledged that Titan had been canceled. Now, details are emerging that apparently shed new light on what Titan could have been and how it ultimately fell apart.Polygon has shared an extended excerpt from Jason Schreier's upcoming book, Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment. In the selected passages, Schreier relates that Titan was essentially two games in one. It was a superhero action title where players could fight bad guys in one part of the game, while also living out their secret identities in a Sims-like environment. That entailed the playable characters getting jobs, places to live, and even letting them cook food. However, the challenge that couldn't be overcome was melding these vastly different experiences into a single cohesive game.Rob Pardo--Blizzard's vice president of game design during Titan's development--was reportedly blamed internally for many of the issues that came up. Pardo was said to be largely hands-off on Titan while overseeing other games at Blizzard, only to come back and disrupt its progress by rejecting things that the team had already begun working on. For all of the time and effort that was put into Titan, the development team had little to show for it when the plug was finally pulled.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

I started by buffing the matte beige shade (Vanilla’d Velvet) all over my lids as a base so the subsequent colors would pop a little more. I was a wee bit nervous about using the shimmery gold all over my lids and the shimmery dark purple on the outer corner because…I’m in my 40s now, and shine doesn’t always play well with my 40-something skin, particularly in the crease. Some may even say that I’m “overly picky about shimmery finishes,” *ahem*. Can you blame me though? One false move and you see every fine line! Buuuut, I decided to go for it anyway, hoping[Continue reading...] The post Classic Smokey Eyes: Honest Beauty Get It Together Eyeshadow Palette appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. A good book you’ve read recently? I really enjoyed “Killers of a Certain Age” by Deanna Raybourn. I’ve been needing a fast, fun read and it hit the spot! Next time you need a book for a plane ride or a vacation, grab it. 2. If you could move anywhere in the world without having to put any effort into it at all (assume someone takes care of the packing, logistics, paperwork, finances, etc.), where would you go? I’d move us to the Manoa neighborhood on Oahu in a heartbeat. 3. What’s a weird breakfast that you like to eat? I don’t know if it’s super weird, but I do love a toasted frozen waffle slathered with peanut butter and sprinkled with raisins.

    "description": "Hiya. So, I’ve seen Harris sneaking around the neighborhood a few times lately — once, a couple days ago when he was chilling under a car out front. I was walking Marnie Mae around the circle when she started barking like mad woman at something. I crouched down to get a better look, and who do you suppose was sitting there totally chillin’ like a villain a few feet away? Yup, Harris, the neighborhood cat lothario (and, incidentally, Tabs’ former foil). Anywho, I also spotted him darting across the main street at the base of our hill (I think he was chasing a squirrel), and then again yesterday skulking through the dry grasses, presumably hunting something else. This post is a reprint in Harris’ honor. He’s still around. I believe he’s about 10 now, still doing what boy cats are apt to do (causing trouble). What’s up with these damn cat stalkers?! Every week there’s a new one trying to dominate the common area, which sucks because that’s where Tabs likes to do his morning[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 831 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

I am overjoyed to be sitting here, just happily typing away about whatever I wanna gab on about, and to not have to deal with a myriad of last-minute, pseudo work emergencies that could’ve been avoided by taking care of one’s administrative tasks early on, OMG! Side note, my day job has been kicking my butt lately. I really do wish more people understood that 1) getting things done early makes everything easier, and 2) you get more bees with honey. Anywho, I’m overjoyed that it’s Saturday, the sun is out and that we have a good chunk of the weekend ahead of us. 🙂 Before I sat down to write, I was thinking about how sometimes, I fall into a mode where everything I want to do feels so daunting that I get overwhelmed before I even start.

    "description": "One blemish on Throne and Liberty’s barnstorming release – one day in and it’s so far up the Steam charts it’s only visible by telescope – has been some unexpected Steam Deck trouble. Despite the fantasy MMORPG having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began trickling in of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: Easy Anti-Cheat, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error. Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many. Read more",

This rowdy band of roustabouts I've collected in the Crusader Kings 3's Roads To Power expansion has the feeling of a found family, each fellow wanderer sporting their own ambitions and quirks. They won't all make it. Many of the people I'm looking at in the glow of these embers will fall on the road, victims of robbery, landslides, and animal attacks.

And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes.

The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a \"cursed\" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees. Read more",

    "description": "Something feels off. I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first. That is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.

A newer, shinier journey to a similar setting sounded like just the ticket. After spending a few hours with the preview build, I do have at least one bit of very positive news to share: I’m definitely going to play Arcanum now, because despite some fetching environments and potentially interesting social systems, New Arc Line just isn’t doing it for me.

In fact, the game’s demo managed to make me go “oooh” then “ah!” in three different ways before I’d even exited the starting elevator. It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep. Read more",

Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

The result is a high-performing, satisfyingly clicky pad that, yes, works wonderfully on PC – albeit one that rinses you for four times(!) as much as a standard Xbox controller. Read more",

    "description": "As befits the “very normal gardening game” that puzzly mystery box Grunn winkingly bills itself as, the first tool I obtained was a pair of shears. The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects. I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?

Speaking as both a news editor and a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza.

You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city.

It's fun to write about Spiders, because you get to frighten people for a moment, before they realise you're talking about the game development studio, Spiders. They have just released GreedFall 2: The Dying Land into early access. For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the \"old world\". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks. Read more",

    "description": "For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant.

Yes! I’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out \"It’s just a demo\" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.

    "description": "Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts. And no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M\u0026K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too. Read more",

Writing of the frigid framing of Clockwork Orange’s atrocities, the film critic Pauline Kael asked: “is there anything sadder - and ultimately more repellent - than a clean-minded pornographer?” The lavishly directed and animated universe of God Of War Ragnarok is far from repellent, but it also feels spiritually squeegeed; a world of pulpy violence so chirpy and chaste as to strain belief that the scars that haunt its reformed anti-hero could have ever been inflicted there.

Reported by Bloomberg as a disagreement over attempts to \"spin off the video-game division as an independent entity,\" the details were nonetheless somewhat scant. A new report from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.

You can do that anywhere.” A QA tester with Zenimax currently on union leave, Mitchell joined the Communications Workers Of America (CWA) as a full-time organiser after she and her colleagues formed what was, at the time, the biggest union in videogames - ZeniMax Workers United. Now she helps the CWA do what they did for her and her colleagues at Zenimax: provide support, training, resources and guidance for workers in the videogame industry who have decided, for whatever reason, that they want to unionise.

    "link": "https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-performance-best-settings",
    "description": "Fifteen months on from its PS5 release, Final Fantasy XVI – that actiony RPG of emo-fringed hack ‘n’ slashing and disquietingly sexy Ralph Ineson characters – is now on PC. Enough time, you’d think, to do a proper job of rejigging it with Windows spanners, especially after Final Fantasy XV’s port got so much stick for its lack of features and performance issues. FFVXI does make some improvements, adopting a full set of DLSS and FSR upscalers and frame generators, and its mouse and keyboard integration feels generally slicker than XV. Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums. Cutting the quality settings can help, as per the guide down below, but overall performance is so up-and-down than you’ll likely never achieve a perfectly smooth ride. Read more",

Cheers then, The Bird Of A Thousand Voices, for showing up in my inbox and giving me a second reference point next to Sugar. This one’s a simple though very striking platformer, inspired by folk legends and scored by composer Tigran Hamasyan. It’s part of a multimedia project based Armenian folk tale Hazaran Blbul (Firebird). It’s completely free, and you can find it here. Read more",
