It's a game of striking jump cuts and slick transitions, of rich diegetic soundscapes underscored by threatening synthetic thrums. Even its protagonist's ever-present narration crackles and whispers as if broadcast through a transistor radio picking up a signal from another realm. Read more",

    "description": "One of the strange, hard-to-grasp questions that quietly haunts a lot of games is whether we are the people we are controlling. Whether we are meant to be those people, anyway. Are we Mario, or are we his custodian for the hours in which we play? Is there one of us involved in these jumps and dashes and Goomba stomps, or two of us, and where are the boundaries to be found? Sometimes the controls in a game are so intuitive that it really feels like it's us on the other side of the screen. We're in sync. And then something will happen - a glitch, a funny movement, a cut-scene - and the gap between avatar and player becomes jarringly visible. It's odd stuff and tricky to think about for long stretches of time without starting to feel a bit weird. Read more",

    "description": "Developer Bloober Team faces a challenging balancing act in bringing a cherished 2001 classic like Silent Hill 2 to a new generation. The good news is that the Silent Hill 2 Remake - released on PlayStation 5 and PC - does capture the essence, the atmosphere of Konami's survival horror, all while making smart upgrades to its design. Despite rebuilding the game on Unreal Engine 5, you'll still recognise its iconic, foggy view over Toluca Lake at the game's start. The cutscenes are now acted out with new motion capture and voice overs and while in control, you'll explore Silent Hill's woodland trails and apartment blocks with an updated control scheme - complete with newly devised puzzles. Likewise, its soundtrack is re-arranged by legendary composer Akira Yamaoka, and even the world layout, the ordering of events, is remixed at points to keep fans, old and new alike, on their toes. Even through all these twists though, at its core, Bloober still successfully takes apart and puts back together the beating heart of what made the 2001 original work. Read more",

    "description": "For a new game studio, there are few genres as difficult to break into as that of the tactical shooter. With the space dominated by behemoths Valorant and Counter-Strike, newcomers are up against established games with deep tactical gameplay, distinctive world designs, and dedicated communities. Newbies face a demanding set of player expectations, with a checklist that includes immaculate gunplay, perfect pacing and ultra-clear level design as the bare minimum. And only when you get beyond that do things get really interesting. What have you got that's fresh, and can encourage new forms of tactical thinking? Can you provide enough of a hook that players will want to stick around to master the mechanics? Is your game simply different enough to stand out? Read more",

Packing a reasonable 1440p60 and 4K30 performance split on base PS5 consoles, the game was already delivering a good visual experience on Sony's 2020 hardware - but there is a compromise between image fluidity and image clarity.

How does PSSR fare in our first extended look at the technology? Is this a good replacement for native 4K, or does it fall short of that lofty target? Read more",

    "description": "Tiny Glade is the sort of indie game we love to be surprised by at Digital Foundry: one that uses seriously impressive custom tech to create something unique. Made by just a two person team, developer Pounce Light has crafted a simple and charming gameplay loop: make, create, and arrange castles, villas, or cottages to your liking using the game's flexible building system. It may be cozycore on the surface, but there's plenty of bespoke stuff driving its warm pastel aesthetic, including ray-traced global illumination (RTGI), ray-traced reflections and loads of procedural tech. Impressively, it all runs really well on near-decade-old GPUs too. RT on a GTX 1060? Believe it. Read more",

    "description": "The second of Destiny 2's new content episodes, Revenant, has arrived, bringing a whole new season pass and a bunch of new rewards spread out over its three Acts. With the replacement of the old seasonal model with the new episodic approach, Destiny 2 has also changed its paid battle passes, expanding to a total of 200 levels where once there were only 100.With the release of Revenant Act 1, you can access the first 100 premium-track levels, with 40 more premium unlockables launched with Act 2 on November 9, and the last 60 rewards coming with Act 3 on January 7. There are also a bunch of rewards on the free track if you opt not to purchase the battle pass, but of course, you'll get significantly fewer rewards.On either track, you can earn this season's new Exotic grenade launcher, Alethonym, which brings a whole new ability to Destiny 2 to allow you to support your fireteam. As you rack up kills with the grenade launcher and charge it up, you can generate ammo for your team; one special ammo brick when the gun is half-charged, or one heavy ammo brick when it's fully charged.The battle pass also includes the new Shadestalker armor set--although it's not available on the battle pass until Act 2, so until then, you'll have to earn it by completing Revenant activities and decrypting Revenant engrams. It's a mix of Eliksni and vampire-hunting aesthetics, giving it a techno-Bloodborne vibe. Equipping a piece of Shadestalker armor gives you one Reputation point with the episode's vendor, Apothecary Eido, for each Reclaimed Vitality, a currency for the new tonic-crafting system, that you earn. Reclaimed Vitality comes from killing enemies anywhere in the system, so it's easy to get, and you earn more points for each additional piece of Shadestalker armor you're wearing up to a total of four per Reclaimed Vitality.If it's been a bit since you popped into Destiny 2, make sure to check out our Final Shape guides hub for more info on everything you can do in the game.

One of the company's classic arcade games, Shinobi, is also heading to theaters with an adaptation at Universal Pictures. And the project has already lined up a director.Via The Hollywood Reporter, Sam Hargrave has signed on to direct the Shinobi movie. Hargrave is a former stuntman and stunt coordinator who directed both Extraction movies on Netflix starring Chris Hemsworth. Hargrave is also slated to direct Extraction 3 for the streamer. Ken Kobayashi will write the script for Shinobi.The original Shinobi hit arcades in 1987, and placed gamers in control of Joe Musashi, a heroic Ninja who is forced to avenge his clan against a ninja crime syndicate called Zeed. Shinobi--which is the original Japanese word for ninja--spawned an additional 13 titles spanning the arcade and home consoles. The most recent game in the series was Shinobi 3D for the Nintendo 3DS in 2011.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Diablo 4 Vessel of Hatred has arrived, bringing a new campaign, area, and class to the dungeon crawling action-RPG. Alongside the expansion is the latest season, Season 6, also known as the Season of Hatred. The new season not only features the new class, Spiritborn, but also features a new difficulty system, new activities like the Realmwalker, and overall improvements to the progression of Diablo 4.The battle pass features 90 tiers of both free and premium rewards, with the Season 6 battle pass featuring some free pirate-themed cosmetic items and the premium cosmetic set called the Soul Drinker's set. The battle pass costs 1,000 Silver (about $10 USD), and the accelerated version, which comes with 20 tier skips and a special emote for each class, costs 2,800 Silver (about $25 USD.) The premium version includes 700 Silver throughout the 90 tiers, so you can earn back most of the cost, assuming you play enough Diablo 4 to finish the battle pass.There are also emotes for each class, special town portal cosmetics, and Smoldering Ashes, which are included in the free tier and let you invest in special Season Blessings, like increased monster XP. While Diablo 4 did recently introduce pets to the game, there aren't any pet cosmetics in the battle pass, but there are two premium sets of horse armor. While you earn battle pass XP just from playing Diablo 4, you earn a larger amount of XP for completing Seasonal Journey objectives. Below, you can find every cosmetic, both free and premium, included in the Diablo 4 Season 6 battle pass.",

I've got the beginning of a very good footprint,\" said Scott via Total Film. \"If there's a Gladiator 3, I don't think you'd ever go back into the arena.

    "description": "8BitDo makes some of the best third-party peripherals for consoles and PC, including a burgeoning series of mechanical keyboards. Just like many of its controllers, 8BitDo's Retro Mechanical Keyboards are inspired by classic video game hardware. Keyboards with NES and Famicom designs came first, but the most recent release is arguably the coolest, and it also happens to be on sale for its lowest price ever for Prime Big Deal Days at Amazon. The C64 Edition is discounted from $110 all the way down to $74.89. Based on the Commodore 64, the keyboard comes with a detachable arcade stick as well as the Super Buttons (two big microswitch buttons). The Super Stick is unique to the C64 Edition. See at Amazon The Famicom, NES, and the M Edition--the most recent addition to the lineup, based on the old IBM keyboard--are also on sale for similar prices during Amazon's sale. The C64 Edition, despite normally costing $10 more than the other three, is actually on sale for the lowest price. But if you don't care about the arcade stick and simply want a solid mechanical keyboard with a color scheme inspired by the original Nintendo, the price difference between these keyboards is small.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The Silent Hill 2 remake reimagines the somber story with modern technology, and the tech in place goes beyond providing a new look for environments and monsters. In a dev diary by developer Bloober Team, the designers explained the work involved in recreating the look of protagonist James Sunderland, including features that showcase him becoming dirtier and more tired as you make progress into the story.\"We wanted to stay true to the original design, but we also wanted to use modern technology to expand on the concept of an ordinary man pushed into extraordinary situations,\" creative director and lead designer Mateusz Lenart said in the dev diary. \"Our version of James has three-day facial hair, you will see his clothes getting dirtier and his face more tired as he progresses through the game.\" Over on X (formerly known as Twitter), a player noticed this visual transformation in James' own fingernails, gaining noticeable dirt over time. Lead character artist Pablo Poliakov added that, while it's easy to get carried away and come up with more flashy designs, it was important for Bloober to retain James' \"not too cool, not too good looking\" aspect. This philosophy carried over to the way the character moves with a hunched posture, as well as his actions in combat or traversal, such as vaulting over windows.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Demon's Souls celebrated its 15-year anniversary on October 6, 2024. Below, we examine how the progenitor of the Soulslike genre forged an uncompromising path for others to follow.Die-hard From Software fans who've dodge-rolled their way through the fiery crucibles of Elden Ring and the Dark Souls series certainly know a thing or two about the origins of the so-called souls-like genre. Defined by a number of discrete pillars--\"bonfire\"-style checkpoints that restore a set number of heals, stamina meters, and menacing bosses--this style of game has become increasingly popular in the past 10 years. Moreover, these design tropes have crystallized into hard-and-fast principles that notable games like Lies of P seem to embrace wholeheartedly.However, if you look at the first entry in the Souls series, the wildly innovative Demon's Souls, you'll find a game that bucks many notions that these newer games take for granted. Instead, it employs many byzantine and downright hostile design ideas that not only chafe against traditional notions of \"fun,\" but the ideals of frictionless gameplay and player empowerment that have increasingly crept into the souls-like space in recent years. The sharp edges of Demon's Souls (and, to a lesser extent, Dark Souls) are as much a part of the series' success as its satisfying combat and intriguing lore, and it'll be interesting to see if From Soft ever returns to that mindset in the coming years.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "If you read more than a few ebooks a year, the Kindle Paperwhite is a smart investment. Not only does it hold thousands of ebooks, but its small footprint makes it easier to travel with than a paperback or hardcover. It’s currently discounted to one of its best prices of the year for Prime Big Deal Days, and you’ll now find it for just $125 (was $150). See Kindle Paperwhite at Amazon See Kindle Scribe at Amazon This is the newest version of the ereader, offering a larger 6.8-inch display, thinner borders, an adjustable light, and up to a staggering 10 weeks of battery life. It’s also waterproof, so you can bring it to the pool without worrying about splashes. Alternatively, there’s a Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle that pairs the Kindle paperwhite with a fabric cover and a power adapter for $135 (was $205). Both versions are ad-supported--expect to drop an extra $15 to buy the ad-free versions.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last person who complimented you on your makeup? My coworker last week. I was wearing a little more coverage than usual, so I think the overall look was more polished than the bare bones FOTDs I’ve been wearing for months now. Amazing what a difference a little bit of concealer makes! 2. Last dream you can remember? Marnie and I were like the Scooby Doo detectives in our neighborhood, ha ha ha! We were working a case to unveil who had stolen all the tuna sandwiches in our circle. 3. Today the temperature in my neighborhood is/was ____. The Bay Area is experiencing a heat wave, ugh! It’s supposed to hit 94. I’m so over it. 4. Your cookie of choice? Lately I’ve been obsessed with snickerdoodles.[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 851 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Rosie soaked up the last bits of summery weather today. She enjoyed basking underneath the trees, which still have leaves on them (but not for long). Among the many things she contemplated were cold fusion, a better way to produce nutritionally dense cat treats, how Marnie the dog is slowly ruining her life, and most importantly, what she’ll wear for Halloween. Unlike Tabs, who loved elaborate costumes, Rosie likes to keep it simple and chic. I asked if she needed any help brainstorming, but all I got were slow blinks and a tum flash in return. When it got too hot to be outside, Rosie made her way back indoors. I couldn’t help but notice her ignoring Marnie… I suspect Rosie’s afraid of Marnie rocking a costume that will steal Rosie’s thunder. Marnie, on the other hand, hasn’t even begun to think about Halloween. She started Marathoning Gilmore Girls this weekend, and she’s currently obsessed.

    "description": "1. It does so much makeup heavy lifting. I swear, I can get away with wearing so much less makeup when I’m wearing a bright lip. I can feel completely put together with just a bright lipstick, mascara and concealer. 2. Bright lipstick shouts however you’re feeling out loud to the world. A smile is that much bigger and brighter with a bright lip. 3. It’s a classic. Red lipstick never goes out of style! 4. The long-wearing matte formulas have improved so much. They last through water, coffee, cat kisses… 5. They’re just so fun to collect! You can never have enough. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post 5 Reasons to Love Bright Lipstick appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

I forgot how beautiful it looks in pictures! The Honest Beauty eyeshadow palette comes with a card with four looks you can do with the palette. I followed the one called “Classic Smoky Eye” for this post, although with one tweak. I started by buffing the matte beige shade (Vanilla’d Velvet) all over my lids as a base so the subsequent colors would pop a little more. I was a wee bit nervous about using the shimmery gold all over my lids and the shimmery dark purple on the outer corner because…I’m in my 40s now, and shine doesn’t always play well with my 40-something skin, particularly in the crease. Some may even say that I’m “overly picky about shimmery finishes,” *ahem*. Can you blame me though? One false move and you see every fine line! Buuuut, I decided to go for it anyway, hoping[Continue reading...] The post Classic Smokey Eyes: Honest Beauty Get It Together Eyeshadow Palette appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

I really enjoyed “Killers of a Certain Age” by Deanna Raybourn. I’ve been needing a fast, fun read and it hit the spot! Next time you need a book for a plane ride or a vacation, grab it. 2. If you could move anywhere in the world without having to put any effort into it at all (assume someone takes care of the packing, logistics, paperwork, finances, etc.), where would you go? I’d move us to the Manoa neighborhood on Oahu in a heartbeat. 3. What’s a weird breakfast that you like to eat?

The result is a very sprightly processor that’s available for relative chump change, especially now that Prime Big Deal Days has sliced it down to £161 in the UK. Read more",

    "description": "Paradox Interactive have not had a rosy couple of years. While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall liked, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it launched with severe bugs and performance issues. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been delayed indefinitely, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently delayed for the umpteenth time into 2025. And then there's the abrupt cancellation of Life By You, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You cost Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023. Read more",

    "link": "https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-2-review",
    "description": "No game protagonist is more willing to stick his hand down a toilet than James Sunderland. Why is he doing this? You would have to ask him or the psychiatrist he badly requires. And it's unlikely he'd explain himself. This isn't the type of story in which the protagonist has difficulty accepting the existence of horrors, nor struggles with the surreality of what he needs to do to get through a locked door. In the opening minutes, James finds a well with a glowing red square floating inside, stares into it (it saves your game), then makes a calm remark about the odd sensation he feels, and moves on. The human corpses that pepper the town of Silent Hill are noticeably that of James himself, his head bludgeoned and bloodied beyond recognition but his jacket and boots unmistakable. He makes no remark on this. It's probably nothing. Read more",

They've also abandoned the proprietary Slipspace game engine used by Halo Infinite in favour of Epic's Unreal Engine 5, which will be the basis for \"multiple new games\". To celebrate the occasion, Halo Studios have released some footage of Project Foundry, an expansive Unreal Engine 5 prototype and spawning vat for actual Halo games, which is billed by the Xbox Newswire as a kind of ur-Halo - \"a true reflection of what would be required for a new Halo game using Unreal, and a training tool for how to get there\".

    "description": "Graham asked me if I'd discovered what the metaphor in Metaphor: ReFantazio might be, and I replied, \"I don't know haha\", or something along those lines. Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect. Metaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed. Read more",

    "description": "There’s a genre of lesser fun that only makes itself known to me once I’ve completely given up on enjoying a game in any traditional sense, lurking under the surface like a silly icon on a losing scratchcard. I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you. At the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat - it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl. Mostly, though, I can only give you advance warning to avoid it.

    "description": "My default movement mode in horror games that actually scare me is: meandering. I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts. Lurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art. Read more",

Its visuals are stark and foreboding, its dialogue delivered in riddles, and its haunting choral music sounds like it's been recorded in a wind tunnel. It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary. What begins as a standard detective game - chatting to strangers, rummaging through junk, finding addresses found on the net - soon spirals into something else entirely. I’ve finished it twice and I’m still not sure I totally understand what it all means. Read more",

    "description": "Windblown is an action roguelite much like Dead Cells, the previous game from developer Motion Twin, but it trades sidescrolling 'vania vibes for a 3D and more colourful world, and adds co-op for up to three pals. That sounds plenty appealing, and it now has a release date: October 24th. Better still, on October 14th, it's getting a singleplayer demo as part of the Steam Next Fest. Read more",

I’ve seen, read, heard, intuited and telepathically detected a lot of complaints about Outlaws stealth, ranging from “it doesn’t look realistic when she punches out stormtroopers through their blaster-resistant hats” to “please remove the hide-and-seek entirely, I wishly merely to pew-pew”. Seems likely that the patch won’t lay all these grievances to rest, to say nothing of the other problems people have with Outlaws. But I’m always interested in how developers Find The Fun in stealth mechanics, given that they are very easily unfun. Read more",

While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do after remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going \"boo!\" Read more",

I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer. Read more",

    "description": "One blemish on Throne and Liberty’s barnstorming release – one day in and it’s so far up the Steam charts it’s only visible by telescope – has been some unexpected Steam Deck trouble. Despite the fantasy MMORPG having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began trickling in of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: Easy Anti-Cheat, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error. Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many. Read more",

This rowdy band of roustabouts I've collected in the Crusader Kings 3's Roads To Power expansion has the feeling of a found family, each fellow wanderer sporting their own ambitions and quirks. They won't all make it. Many of the people I'm looking at in the glow of these embers will fall on the road, victims of robbery, landslides, and animal attacks. One of them will sacrifice their life to save the rest of us. All will bring me a step closer to my goal: I am walking from Ireland to China. Read more",

And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes.

The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a \"cursed\" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees. Read more",

A world of social and economic calamity that looks, nonetheless, rather pleasant. I like the art deco retro-future vibe. Read more",

    "description": "Something feels off. I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first. That is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.

A newer, shinier journey to a similar setting sounded like just the ticket. After spending a few hours with the preview build, I do have at least one bit of very positive news to share: I’m definitely going to play Arcanum now, because despite some fetching environments and potentially interesting social systems, New Arc Line just isn’t doing it for me.

In fact, the game’s demo managed to make me go “oooh” then “ah!” in three different ways before I’d even exited the starting elevator. It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep. Read more",

Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects. I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?

Speaking as both a news editor and a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza. This, at least, is the condensed analysis offered by Food Boy, which launched this week on Steam. Read more",

You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have \"consequential dialogue choices\" and a \"Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads\".
