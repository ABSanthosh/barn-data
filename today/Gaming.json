Made by just a two person team, developer Pounce Light has crafted a simple and charming gameplay loop: make, create, and arrange castles, villas, or cottages to your liking using the game's flexible building system. It may be cozycore on the surface, but there's plenty of bespoke stuff driving its warm pastel aesthetic, including ray-traced global illumination (RTGI), ray-traced reflections and loads of procedural tech. Impressively, it all runs really well on near-decade-old GPUs too. RT on a GTX 1060? Believe it. Read more",

The problem? Hadea is a hermit state. The only reason why Rémi lives outside of its borders is thanks to his mother, who smuggled him out when he was five. Unfortunately, she was caught by the Hadea border control, leaving him alone and eventually entering the Canadian foster system. Her capture, and the fact that his father was a blacksmith in a village called Jova, are the only things he truly remembers from his short time in Hadea. It's due to this that Rémi, despite understanding the rationality behind his parents actions, wants to reunite with them and learn exactly why they got him out. Read more",

    "description": "A new DF Direct Weekly lands - as usual - today, with the team's thoughts on the recent State of Play, reaction to the most recent RTX 5080/5090 leaks and, perhaps inevitably, more PlayStation 5 Pro. However, it's actually a point raised in last week's Direct that I want to tackle in this week's blog. Many believe - with some justification - that the PS5 Pro is a step too far and that such a console isn't needed. In fact, we've made the argument ourselves. Looking back at that piece, I warned about higher costs of a Pro console, but also looked at the potential improvements it could bring - all of which have come to pass with PS5 Pro. Microsoft declined the opportunity to follow likewise, but now we have some idea of why Sony has taken a different route and perhaps more of the strategy is now understandable. Read more",

Instead, this change results in a dramatically different kind of experience that demands creativity and experimentation from the player. Read more",

    "description": "Halo: Flashpoint Spartan Edition $125 | Releases October 25 Preorder at Amazon The epic sci-fi combat of the Halo video game series is getting adapted to official tabletop form with the upcoming Halo: Flashpoint. The skirmish game sees players assemble teams of Halo Spartans or Banished Elites and send them into tactical turn-based battles. Those who have played similar wargames like Warhammer 40,000--especially the smaller-scale Killteam format--will find Halo: Flashpoint's premise and gameplay familiar, but the game's creator, Mantic Entertainment, says it'll be easy to learn for newcomers to the genre.If you want to get started with the new tabletop wargame, you can preorder the Halo: Flashpoint Spartan Edition box that includes enough minis and terrain for two players to engage in epic Spartan versus Banished skirmishes, plus all the necessary rulebooks, playing cards, and other gameplay pieces to learn to play the game. You can preorder Halo: Flashpoint Spartan Edition for $125 at Amazon ahead of its October 25 release.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Ubisoft hasn't been shy about admitting that Star Wars Outlaws didn't have the strong launch that the company was hoping for. Some reports have stated that Star Wars Outlaws only sold 1 million copies to date. Regardless, Ubisoft hasn't abandoned its efforts to improve the game, and the latest patch may go a long way towards fixing many of the game's issues.The new Star Wars Outlaws - Title Update 2 is out now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, via the official Ubisoft site. Some of the most notable changes are related to Outlaws' stealth sequences. AI detection has been tweaked and and other elements like the number of NPCs and their patrols have also been modified. The speeder experience was also changed to improve the camera position and the collision was reduced to keep players from being knocked off their speeders so easily.If there's an upside to Ubisoft's Star Wars Outlaws experience it may be that the company appears to have taken the lessons it's learned to heart. Assassin's Creed Shadows was pushed back to early 2025 to give the developers more time to work out any significant bugs before launch. The hope is that Shadows will launch with far fewer gameplay issues than Outlaws had at the start.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Last year, during the run up to the release of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Disney brought the first four films--Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull--to Disney+. But as of this month, Dial of Destiny is the last Indiana Jones movie streaming on Disney+.This shouldn't be too surprising for fans of the franchise. Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012 gave the studio full ownership of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Willow, and all of the other intellectual properties that were created under George Lucas. However, that deal did not retroactively give Disney the rights to any of the movies produced before 2012. That's why the distribution rights for the first four Indiana Jones movies remain with Paramount. There was a similar situation with the first six Star Wars films, but that was resolved in 2019 when Disney purchased all of Fox's entertainment assets. While Paramount+ is the natural destination for the first four Indiana Jones films, it isn't their next stop. All four movies are now streaming on Amazon's Prime Video service. But it's likely that they will return to Paramount+ at some point, and they may even show up on Peacock or Netflix. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred and its 2.0 update bring huge changes to the ARPG, ranging from a complete difficulty revamp, massive class adjustments, the return of features like Mercenaries and Runewords, and a brand-new class, the Spiritborn, defenders of the jungle who channel powerful animal spirits to decimate their foes. But most importantly, it adds new loot.There's plenty of that coming in Vessel of Hatred. In total, Blizzard has confirmed there are 24 new Unique items coming in the expansion, one for each base game class and 16 for the newly introduced Spiritborn. Unique items are far more powerful following Diablo 4 Season 5, and in Vessel of Hatred, they're getting even stronger.All Ancestral items now roll with a guaranteed Greater Affix (with a chance for more) making Ancestral Uniques better than ever. This list includes four new game-changing Mythic Unique items--one for the Spiritborn and three useable by any class. As you're reading through the list, keep in mind that the affixes and stats shown in the images may have been adjusted after the Vessel of Hatred public test realm period.Each item's updated effects and stats, as listed in the official patch 2.0.1 patch notes, will be provided in the text beneath each image, and remember that items in the game have randomly generated rolls within each item's range and an assigned Greater Affix roll that might not exactly match the ones listed here.

    "description": "When times are tough, one of the best things you can have on hand is a Squishmallow. They're as soft as a cat, and they aren't equipped with murder mittens, making them ideal emotional support pillows. You can grab a few Squishmallows that sport a Pokemon-influenced design, capturing the cuddliness of several of these pocket monsters. The star of this new range is the holiday-themed Pikachu, an incredibly huggable replica of the world's most famous Pokemon, but with an adorable beanie. He'll be available starting November 3 and will be priced at $25. Preorder at Target Gotta hug 'em all!Along with the new Pikachu, the 14-inch Fuecoco, 14-inch Belibolt, and 20-inch Belibolt Squishmallows are all back in stock at Amazon.

    "description": "In 2018, God of War introduced players to Atreus, the son of Kratos. And while gamers were largely charmed by the father and son bond that they forged, Atreus was a little overly chatty. That trend continued in the 2022 sequel, God of War Ragnarok. But now, a new mod has been created for the recently released PC port that keeps Atreus and other companions from stepping all over the game's puzzles.Via IGN, a NexusMods user, Mophead01, has released the Please Shut Up mod. This expands on Sony's previously released option to decrease the frequency of hints for the puzzles that Kratos has to solve throughout the game. Mophead01 felt that did little to address the actual problem, including recurring instances where Atreus reminds gamers how to perform basic actions. Thus the mod has taken the drastic step of removing over 1,500 lines of dialogue from the game.\"Tired of companions telling you things you already know? Tired of the game treating you like a child if you don't instantly solve every puzzle? This mod removes over 1,500 pointless, [patronizing] voice lines from the game,\" wrote Mophead01.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

In a LinkedIn post by the former head of production at XR Games, it's claimed that 72 people from the studio's 84-person workforce were let go.\"This goes beyond restructuring,\" the former staff member wrote (via Road to VR and Eurogamer). \"I'll keep my thoughts and observations to myself. Today, my focus is on helping those affected.\"Multiple roles have reportedly been affected across the studio, although XR Games has not officially confirmed that it has carried out this round of layoffs.

I forgot how beautiful it looks in pictures! The Honest Beauty eyeshadow palette comes with a card with four looks you can do with the palette. I followed the one called “Classic Smoky Eye” for this post, although with one tweak. I started by buffing the matte beige shade (Vanilla’d Velvet) all over my lids as a base so the subsequent colors would pop a little more. I was a wee bit nervous about using the shimmery gold all over my lids and the shimmery dark purple on the outer corner because…I’m in my 40s now, and shine doesn’t always play well with my 40-something skin, particularly in the crease. Some may even say that I’m “overly picky about shimmery finishes,” *ahem*. Can you blame me though? One false move and you see every fine line!

I really enjoyed “Killers of a Certain Age” by Deanna Raybourn. I’ve been needing a fast, fun read and it hit the spot! Next time you need a book for a plane ride or a vacation, grab it. 2. If you could move anywhere in the world without having to put any effort into it at all (assume someone takes care of the packing, logistics, paperwork, finances, etc.), where would you go? I’d move us to the Manoa neighborhood on Oahu in a heartbeat. 3. What’s a weird breakfast that you like to eat? I don’t know if it’s super weird, but I do love a toasted frozen waffle slathered with peanut butter and sprinkled with raisins.

I was walking Marnie Mae around the circle when she started barking like mad woman at something. I crouched down to get a better look, and who do you suppose was sitting there totally chillin’ like a villain a few feet away? Yup, Harris, the neighborhood cat lothario (and, incidentally, Tabs’ former foil). Anywho, I also spotted him darting across the main street at the base of our hill (I think he was chasing a squirrel), and then again yesterday skulking through the dry grasses, presumably hunting something else. This post is a reprint in Harris’ honor. He’s still around. I believe he’s about 10 now, still doing what boy cats are apt to do (causing trouble). What’s up with these damn cat stalkers?! Every week there’s a new one trying to dominate the common area, which sucks because that’s where Tabs likes to do his morning[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 831 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

Have you not seen the Rocky Horror Show? It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer. Read more",

Despite the fantasy MMORPG having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began trickling in of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: Easy Anti-Cheat, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error. Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many. Read more",

This rowdy band of roustabouts I've collected in the Crusader Kings 3's Roads To Power expansion has the feeling of a found family, each fellow wanderer sporting their own ambitions and quirks.

The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes.

The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a \"cursed\" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees. Read more",

I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first. That is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.

It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep. Read more",

    "title": "Breachway early access review: a graceful reinvention of starship combat as a question of taut deckbuilding",
    "link": "https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/breachway-early-access-review",
    "description": "The beauty of cards is that they can be anything. You can slap together a working game with them in a couple of minutes. Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

    "description": "We’ve known for years that consoles have simply become preboxed PCs, and now look: we’re getting into their controllers as well. The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro (and its wired cousin, the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition) has looked to desktop peripherals in search of superior button-bashing, cannibalising the rather good Razer Viper gaming mouse series for its switches. The result is a high-performing, satisfyingly clicky pad that, yes, works wonderfully on PC – albeit one that rinses you for four times(!) as much as a standard Xbox controller. Read more",

    "description": "As befits the “very normal gardening game” that puzzly mystery box Grunn winkingly bills itself as, the first tool I obtained was a pair of shears. The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects. I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?

Speaking as both a news editor and a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza.

    "description": "Indie developers love making retro-styled games that look like PlayStation games you rented from Blockbuster and blitzed through in a feverish winter weekend. I'm glad, so here's another. Cold And Afraid is a murder mystery that aims to channel the 1990s with chunky characters and lots of lovely dithering.

    "description": "A week ago, while belabouring the nuances of Arco, I expressed a wish to play more bullet hell games with time freeze mechanics, the better to savour the intricacy of their projectile patterning. Now here's Moon Watch, a Vampire Survivors-ish pixelart shooter in which you have a watch that stops time when you stand still. Snug within that frozen instant, you're free to laugh in the gurning faces of the living dead while you idly choose and aim garlic grenades, stake launchers and bouncy ice comets. Read more",

Darkest Dungeon is a horror game like DBD, so I guess the acquisition chimes from that perspective. All the same, my snap judgement is \"yikes\". Read more",

For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the \"old world\". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks. Read more",

    "description": "For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant.

I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out \"It’s just a demo\" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.

    "description": "Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts. And no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M\u0026K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too. Read more",

    "description": "Shirley Curry, aka the \"Skyrim Grandma\", is no longer posting gaming videos, she's told her viewers. An upcoming eye surgery is going to leave her recovering for some weeks and (more importantly to her) she is simply tired of playing games for an audience. \"It isn't fun anymore,\" she says in a video. \"I'm tired of it. I'm bored with it, bored to death with it. So I am making the decision now - totally, finally - I am not going to be making any more gaming videos and uploading them.\" Read more",

    "description": "Spoilers throughout. TLDR: fun, generous, beautiful animation and cinematography. Worked mostly fine on my PC. I would not have given it the best narrative award if it were up against Gran Turismo 7. Writing of the frigid framing of Clockwork Orange’s atrocities, the film critic Pauline Kael asked: “is there anything sadder - and ultimately more repellent - than a clean-minded pornographer?” The lavishly directed and animated universe of God Of War Ragnarok is far from repellent, but it also feels spiritually squeegeed; a world of pulpy violence so chirpy and chaste as to strain belief that the scars that haunt its reformed anti-hero could have ever been inflicted there.

Reported by Bloomberg as a disagreement over attempts to \"spin off the video-game division as an independent entity,\" the details were nonetheless somewhat scant. A new report from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.

You couldn’t injure yourself on those scythes if you tried. It’s polearm-ical correctness gone mad! Well, good news if you’re nostalgic for a simpler time, where tiny scythes could maim you for life, and binary digits came in lots of eight and not a binary digit more. RPG Beyond Shadowgate is a vastly-expanded, modernised sequel to the classic NES adventure, created by the original’s designers, and it just released last week. Read more",
