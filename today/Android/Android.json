    "description": "Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip7 is expected to launch in early July alongside the Galaxy Z Fold7, and we've recently heard that the Flip7 would be using Samsung's long-delayed Exynos 2500 chipset.

The issues with Samsung's LSI (the chip design arm) run so deep that reports suggest a merger between Samsung LSI and another division, most likely Foundry.
