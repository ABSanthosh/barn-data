    "description": "Oppo's Reno13 and Reno13 Pro went official in China last month, and now it seems like their international launch is imminent. That's because they are in the process of receiving various certifications left and right. The Reno13 has been certified by Taiwan's NCC, India's BIS, Thailand's NBTC, as well as the FCC. So it's pretty clear that it will be available across the world.
