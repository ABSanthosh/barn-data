The source says the phone will be offered in a total of four colorways, of which three have been outed today: Pantone Black Oyster, Pantone Dazzling Blue, and Pantone Dill (Pantone Grey Mist remains a mist-ery for now).

Then, we got word that there was a chance of Samsung going with the Dimensity 9400 instead. Today, it seems like neither of those rumors were true. A Galaxy S25 FE prototype has seemingly run Geekbench, and as always this has revealed its chipset, which is the Exynos 2400. Not the 2400e found in the S24 FE, but the 2400, which has a prime CPU core clocked 100 MHz higher. Samsung Galaxy S25 FE SM-S731U confirmed to feature Exynos 2400 chipset.Specifications🔳 Exynos 2400 SoC🎮...",
