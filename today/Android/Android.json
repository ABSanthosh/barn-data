That said, we were sitting on the … Continued Read the original post: July Pixel Update Brings Two Fixes Says Verizon",

    "description": "The vivo X200 FE has a big presence for such a small phone – looking at the results from last week’s poll, this could be the best mini flagship out there. And yes, it’s a mini flagship, less than 5% of voters had issues with the size. Many still haven’t made up their minds and are waiting for a review (ours is coming soon).

    "description": "The hotly anticipated Nothing flagship is here – and everyone is talking about it. Unfortunately for Nothing, most of the discussion is about the price and the design and let’s just say that people aren’t heaping praise on the Phone (3). We can’t do anything about the design, but we can help with the price. The Nothing Phone (3), the 512GB model specifically, is already discounted by $100. You can think of this as a free storage upgrade. Note that the phone is still on pre-order and will only start shipping on July 15. The Phone (3) features a 6.67” 1260p+ 120Hz OLED display, not an...",
