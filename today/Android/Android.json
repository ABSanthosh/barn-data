    "description": "T-Mobile today announced the general availability of T-Satellite, its satellite communications service, to everyone, following months of testing with up to 30,000 daily active users.

So it's easy to assume that the Galaxy S25 Edge is almost identical to the S25+ with some minor improvements to the chassis that bring down the overall weight. However, a recent side-by-side teardown video reveals much more. It turns out that Samsung was able to shave off a few grams from every component, not just...",
