    "description": "According to a new rumor from the usual reliable Digital Chat Station over on Weibo, all four iPhone 17 models will sport 12GB of RAM, and the A19 Pro chip used for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will be made on TSMC's 3nm process with significantly improved performance versus the A18 Pro.

This normally costs €10 to ride, but from May 3 until May 18, it will be free as Samsung is apparently paying for everyone's tickets. As you can see from the image above, Samsung's Galaxy AI will feature prominently on the wheel itself.
