    "description": "OnePlus has its new mid-range killer on the market now, the OnePlus 13R. Priced at only $599, the spec sheet on this phone is pretty nuts for the price, offering things you might normally find on much more expensive devices. Available in Black (Nebula Noir) or White (Astral Trail), the phone features a large 6.78-inch … Continued Read the original post: OnePlus 13R Now Available, Insane Specs for $599",

    "description": "Another day, another Galaxy S25 image leak. This time around we have a couple of shots showing the Galaxy S25 or the S25+ (they look exactly the same, the only difference is the size) on one hand, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra on the other. There's an interesting detail in this first image, namely that the outer part of the camera 'rings' matches the color of the phone's back, at least in this rather dark blue hue. As you can see, the frame is flat, the screen is flat, and the bezels are insanely thin (and thinner than last year). Moving on to the Ultra, the color matching of the camera...",

    "description": "Samsung is announcing the Galaxy S25 family on January 22, and ahead of that the company has started a full-on teaser campaign, which made its debut yesterday involving Bixby (yes, really). Today's chapter is all about Sketch to Image, the AI feature that launched last year. With the Galaxy S25 series (and presumably the One UI 7 update for older flagship models), this will get even better. Sketch to Image will be integrated into Drawing Assist and will be able to use more than one input. So you can still sketch, either with the S Pen or your finger, but you can also describe the...",
