  "text": "Alongside the global launch of the Redmi Watch 5 as well as its new smartphones, Xiaomi unveiled two new wireless earbud models with the Redmi Buds 6 and 6 Pro, both of which are priced well below what most competitors are charging. Available at around 40 EUR, the Redmi Buds 6 come with a wide array of features including active noise cancellation (ANC) with a depth of up to 49dB and 2kHz bandwidth, as well as a dual-driver system that works in tandem with multiple ANC modes and adaptive transparency settings. There’s also dual-mic AI noise reduction for reduced ambient noise during calls, and immersive sound with 360-degree audio. The Redmi Buds 6 come in Cloud White, Night Black, and Coral Green, and can last for 10 hours with each charge with a maximum of 42 hours with the charging case. Meanwhile, the Redmi Buds 6 Pro are a bit more expensive at around 75 EUR, although they step up in the hardware department. Xiaomi says that the Buds 6 Pro are equipped with coaxial triple drivers that are Hi-Res Audio Wireless Certified, as well as PZT dual tweeters that work in tandem with an 11mm driver with a titanium diaphragm for better-sounding bass and high tones. There’s also built-in dimensional audio that supports head-tracking, as well as 55dB ANC with 4kHz coverage. For battery, the earbuds can last for up to 9.5 hours on a single charge, with a total of 36 hours using the charging case and ANC enabled. They’re available in black, white, and lavender.",
