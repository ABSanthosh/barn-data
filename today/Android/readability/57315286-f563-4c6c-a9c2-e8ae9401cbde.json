It was supposed to be the GTA VI of space. A sprawling, endlessly ambitious sci-fi MMO, crowdfunded by fans and sculpted by dreamers. But nearly 14 years after it began development, Star Citizen finds itself at a curious crossroads: swimming in money, still in alpha, and grappling with a problem that no amount of cash seems able to solve. A Dream Funded by Millions Launched in 2011 and backed by a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign in 2012, Star Citizen has become one of the most talked-about and divisive games in development history. With more than $850 million raised to date—yes, you read that correctly—it’s closing in on the kind of production budget usually reserved for Hollywood blockbusters or Rockstar’s upcoming GTA VI. Players can already access the alpha build, available for a price ranging from €64 to €102, depending on the edition. And if you fancy an upgrade, there’s always the in-game shop offering premium spacecraft for real-world cash. It’s a model that’s fuelled Cloud Imperium Games’ coffers with tens of millions—$25.5 million in the first quarter of 2025 alone. Proof, if ever it were needed, that the fanbase is as devoted as it is deep-pocketed. But with all this money, you’d expect the game to be rock-solid by now. Instead, Star Citizen finds itself battling a very old enemy: cheaters. Cheaters in the Void It’s one thing to be in a state of perpetual development. It’s quite another to let your alpha test environment become a playground for players who simply refuse to play fair. According to reports flooding Reddit, Star Citizen has seen a rise in baffling, infuriating incidents. Players are being killed out of nowhere—no combat, no weapons, no chance to react: just sudden death, likely courtesy of external software or exploits. Frustration has grown to the point where Cloud Imperium Games has had to publicly step in. In a recent statement on the game’s official forum, the developers addressed the elephant in the cockpit: “We understand that some users may be experimenting or acting out of curiosity… but these actions can be disruptive and damaging. Such behaviour can result in severe consequences, including permanent account bans.” Strong words, and arguably long overdue. For a game that promises such depth and immersion, fundamental fairness and security should be a given. Yet here we are, more than a decade in, and Star Citizen is still fighting to keep its virtual world balanced. Money Can’t Buy Everything What’s striking is how Star Citizen has achieved so much in terms of ambition—hundreds of ships, planets, features—yet still lacks some of the fundamentals. Cheating isn’t just an annoyance; it undermines the entire premise of player-driven space exploration and conflict. When you can be taken out without warning or reason, the stakes vanish. So does the fun. Yes, Star Citizen continues to evolve. Yes, its community remains loyal (and vocal). But unless it gets a handle on its cheating problem—and ideally, progresses beyond alpha—questions about where all that money’s going will only get louder. After 14 years and $800 million, people aren’t just asking for polish. They’re asking for progress. And above all, they’re asking for a game that plays fair. Previous Post",
