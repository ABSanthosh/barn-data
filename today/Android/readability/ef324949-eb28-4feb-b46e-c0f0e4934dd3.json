  "text": "(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central) Page 1 of 5: Best Meta Quest games overall Picking the best Meta Quest games has become harder than ever! VR devs target the Meta Quest store first because it has the most users, so aside from a few rare PC VR or PSVR 2 exclusives, all of the best VR games period are available for the Quest 3, 3S, and 2. Plus, Meta now shows indie App Lab games on its storefront, so search results are flooded now with Gorilla Tag clones.No one wants to spend money on junk games or experiences with low value, but it's hard sifting through thousands of games. That's where our team of VR fanatics comes in!We spend a lot of leisure time blocking out reality with the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S, as we did with the Quest 2, and every pick on our list comes personally played or recommended by our two resident VR fanatics, Nick Sutrich and Michael Hicks, as well as our freelance team of VR writers.Our picks below are our favorite 25 Meta Quest games across all genres. But keeping the list that short was too painful, as it left out many of our other favorites (and fan faves). So we've included four other pages, accessible via the drop-down menu above or the links below, with five great games in each of these categories:Page 2: Best Meta Quest shooters, multiplayer shooters, and social multiplayer Page 3: Best Meta Quest music/rhythm, exercise, and sports games Page 4: Best Meta Quest action and horror games Page 5: Best Meta Quest puzzle, strategy, and games for kids/ teensIf you've already played our favorites, check out or bookmark our list of upcoming Meta Quest 3 games! We update it every month so you're sure to find plenty of fresh titles coming soon that'll scratch that itch.Best Meta Quest gamesNote: We've organized our best Meta Quest games picks in alphabetical order, rather than try to rank games like Beat Saber, Supernatural, or Asgard's Wrath 2 with very different strengths and hooks.Asgard's Wrath 2Why you can trust Android Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.THE best Meta Quest game, hands downSometimes, a game is so good you can hardly believe it exists. Asgard's Wrath 2 is one such game, and while it's not a recognizable IP to non-VR fans, Quest owners who jump into this world will never forget it.Simply put, Asgard's Wrath 2 is the best VR game ever made. It's a massive 100+ hour-long RPG stuffed with combat, loot, exploration, puzzles, mini-games, and even a roguelike game-within-a-game. Big-name voice actors fill the game with superb dialog, and the score is both epic and memorable in a way seldom seen in VR.Developer Sanzaru Games spent the first game — which is excellent but designed for Oculus Rift only — in Northern Europe. This time, you follow protagonist Loki to ancient Egypt, where the gods are big and the lands are even bigger.You'll explore a total of four different realms, each of which introduces a new playable character. Each character can traverse through the realms, helping to add some Metroidvania-like exploration qualities to the already massive game. During your travels, you'll also meet five companions, each with a unique move set and transformation into a helper or mount.As you progress through the game, you'll earn experience points that can be spent on massive skill trees for upgrades. But it's not just each character that has a skill tree. Each companion has its own skill tree, as well, encouraging players to explore the procedurally-generated Uncharted Rifts regularly, or just scour the landscape in search of monster dens and Loki anomalies to pillage.There's nothing bigger or more robust in VR than Asgard's Wrath 2. — Nick SutrichAssassin's Creed Nexus VRA return to Assassin's Creed roots, with a 30-hour campaign and full freedom of movementIf you told me a few years ago that we would have a full and proper Assassin's Creed VR game on the Meta Quest platform, I would have said you were a liar. Fast-forward a few years to the Meta Quest 3's debut and, somehow, here we are.Assassin's Creed Nexus VR is the return to roots the series has needed after straying so far from the original formula for the past several entries. The game focuses on climbing, parkour, stealth, and, of course, assassination, all while wrapping the action around a compelling storyline.You'll jump in the shoes of a hacker helping the Templars retrieve pieces of an ancient computer from memories stored in Abstergo's cloud. But a computer that can tell the future and give the Templars full control is too much for the Assassins, and you get hired on as a double agent bent on deleting the key components of the memories to hide this computer forever.Play as Conor, Ezio, and Kassandra as you make your way through 2,500 years of human history in over 15 memories, each of which takes place in a different location. The first tie you climb up a Venetian building and parkour off its roof to the adjacent building, you'll immediately feel at home. This is the game we wanted, a proper game instead of a spin-off or on-rails experience. —Nick SutrichBeat SaberA VR icon that's only gotten more massiveI still remember the original Beat Saber trailer blowing me away. Holding lightsabers laser swords and slicing blocks to the beat of a song, all in VR? Talk about a dream come true! Little did I know what simply looked like a ton of fun would become the defining reason that so many people would jump into VR. Beat Saber is for anyone and everyone, with skill levels and songs to please all sorts. Beat Saber hardly needs my introduction. It's become a pop culture icon the way no other VR game can even claim, boasting over $100 million in sales on the Quest in 2021 — and probably much more since. Since Meta acquired it, Beat Saber has added dozens of DLC packs from Imagine Dragons, BTS, Skrillex, Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish, Lizzo, Linkin Park, The Weeknd, Queen, The Rolling Stones, and even Daft Punk, plus medley packs themed around genres like hip-hop, rock, and electronic.The addictive block-slicing gameplay will have you coming back again and again until you, quite literally, can't move your arms. If this one isn't already in your library, fix that mistake this instant. —Nick SutrichBlade \u0026 Sorcery: NomadMedieval duels backed by a realistic physics engineOne of the most popular PC VR games, Blade \u0026 Sorcery is a giant sandbox where you fight foes with swords, bows and arrows, or magical attacks. Its popularity stems from the realistic physics engine, which lets you parry or deflect attacks and ensures your weapons don't just teleport through foes.Now it is available untethered on the Quest 2 \u0026 3 with Blade \u0026 Sorcery: Nomad, so your duels to the death can become fully roomscale. Plus, it adds a new procedurally generated Dungeons mode in which you traverse through different environments, vanquishing foes, collecting loot, and leveling up your skills. This port will even allow you to use mods, which creative gamers have used to add foes from Star Wars, Marvel, and other popular brands.Nick described B\u0026S combat as \"a balanced mix of \"video gamey\" and semi-realistic that feels just right. The Goldilocks of VR weapon handling, if you will,\" in his hands-on. He encouraged me to try it, and I loved the hack-and-slash gameplay too. It's impressive that developer Warpfrog managed to make the game work with the Quest's limited hardware at all, and it's been a blast to play so far. —Michael HicksBreachersSerious shooter fans, start hereAs I said in our review, Breachers is the best multiplayer game I've yet played on Quest. Given the general quality of games on this very list, that's saying quite a bit, but it also highlights one of the things missing from a lot of VR games — yes, even the best ones. Polish.Breachers is polished in a way that makes it feel like it was developed by a AAA studio including a distinct lack of bugs and \"jank,\" as people like to call it. It's also got some of the very best graphics and 3D audio of any Quest game I've played, and I've played a lot of Quest games.Breachers is a 5v5 multiplayer shooter that channels the best parts of games like Rainbow Six: Siege. One side plays SWAT (Enforcers), the other side plays terrorists (Revolters). Revolters begin inside a building and have already planted a bomb. Meanwhile, Enforcers are charged with breaching the compound and disarming the bomb before it detonates.Each round begins with a minute-or-so-long period where players can buy new gear and plan their attack or defense. Revolters have access to traps that can be set up in the building to ward off the Enforcers while the bomb's timer ticks down.Meanwhile, Enforcers have access to gadgets like cloaking devices and drones that will help them infiltrate the building successfully. Plus, enforcers can rappel up and down walls and use breaching foam to detonate specific walls that can be used in a surprise attack.It's a ton of fun that involves teamwork and skill, and there's always the team deathmatch mode if you just want to shoot it out for a few rounds. My only request is that the developers add in a squad mode so you can travel with your crew of friends. Otherwise, you're looking at the most polished, impressive game launch we've seen in VR since Half-Life: Alyx. — Nick SutrichContractors ShowdownThe VR battle royale you've been waiting forContractors earns two spots on our best Quest games list: You'll find Contractors under Multiplayer Shooters on the next page as a traditional FPS experience, but Contractors Showdown is for Battle Royale fans, and it excels at it.Contractors Showdown lets you play with triple the number of players as Population: One. It has the traditional BR start with you dropping down onto a massive map with some impressive realism and plenty of weapons and support items scattered throughout. You also wear a wrist-based computer where you can control kill-streak perks like drones or air raids.If you're familiar with battle royales, then you'll feel right at home with Showdown. You'll get used to different weapon types and builds and learn on the fly against other players. It's a great way to get your Warzone-esque fix without the less grounded gameplay of Pop: One. —Nick SutrichDemeoFar over the Misty Mountains cold, to dungeons deep and caverns oldTake to the dungeons and complete thrilling campaigns alongside three other friends (or random folks) in this Dungeons \u0026 Dragons-like experience. Players choose a character — each of which has a unique class and set of skills — that will be used to traverse through each campaign. Those campaigns are made up of multi-level dungeons filled with treasures and trials alike. Aside from the standard move-by-grid gameplay, players can look to their hands for special moves played with cards.Demeo is as much a great multiplayer game as it is an excellent strategy game. Sure, you could delve into the dungeons on your own, but you'll quickly find that Demeo is a bit too challenging for just one player. Thankfully, if you don't have any friends with the game, matchmaking will pair you up with the strategy experts and avid D\u0026D fans that make up the Demeo community. There's even a hangout area the developer calls the Tinyverse where folks can meet up and plan games together.Demeo launched with a single campaign and received a second just a few months after release. Since then, it's added several new campaigns and playable characters, complete with new spell cards, bosses, and exciting new modes to come. You can even use the Quest's mixed reality features to play the virtual game on a real table. Then Demeo Battles launched in 2023 as a separate PvP mode, letting you become the Dungeon Master you've always wanted to be! —Nick SutrichDungeons of EternityDungeon-crawling excellenceIf you're a gamer who loves fantasy, chances are high that you've imagined what it would be like to actually live out a Dungeons \u0026 Dragons adventure. To say Dungeons of Eternity offers that experience would be selling it short. Dungeons of Eternity is all that and so much more.It's a co-op dungeon crawler for up to three players (though solo play is fully supported) with a robust combat system that combines ranged, magic, and physical attacks. You can alternate between heavy axe swings, parrying with your sword, and then unloading your crossbow mid-battle with a wide variety of vicious monsters, all with other players fighting alongside you. Android Central's Nick Sutritch said it best in his hands-on impressions: \"I'm not sure I can think of another VR game that made me feel as badass as Dungeons of Eternity.\" The combat alone is enough to be excited about, but when you factor in that this is a roguelike with randomization between runs and a near-endless amount of randomly generated loot, it's clear that Dungeons of Eternity is offering a truly next-level VR experience. —Nick RansbottomA Fisherman's Tale seriesA dream within a dream within a dreamThere's really just no comparison to how perspective can be used in VR, and A Fisherman's Tale is the perfect example of a game that thrives on the aspect of perspective and scale that VR can bring. What starts as a tale of a simple fisherman who mans a lighthouse quickly evolves into a tale of psychological wonder.Players will interact with every object in the lighthouse, but beware: you may not be controlling who you think you're controlling. Are you the fisherman himself or the puppet in the model lighthouse? Are these stories real, or are they tall tales from a sailor who has seen too many days lost at sea?Riddles, mind-bending mysteries, tricky puzzles, and bizarre situations await you in one of the most unique puzzle games you'll likely ever play. This one isn't just about matching shapes up to complete a goal. It's also about living through an adventure story and adapting to the realities you begin to uncover.When you're done with that, A Fisherman's Tale 2 completely changes things up by introducing brand new mechanics including larger, free-roam areas. Your days as a fisherman haven't just given you tall tales to tell, they've also imbued you with special powers that can only be called by the sea.Whether you're tossing your hand and controlling it remotely like Thing from The Addam's Family or even popping off your own head to rest in a bird nest, Another Fisherman's Tale is filled to the brim with creativity and a surprisingly touching narrative that's sure to bring you to tears when it's all done. —Nick SutrichFive Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 1 \u0026 2Chuck E. Cheese animatronics weren't even close to being this scaryThere are two types of Five Nights at Freddy's (FNaF) fans out there: those who obsessively watch theory videos about the Bite of '87 and those who just enjoy watching their favorite YouTuber scream over animatronic jumpscares. The Quest ports appeal to both types. You can revisit scenes from old entries and get to interpret obscure lore moments, but it also lets casual fans enjoy jumpscares without worrying about the details.As someone who saw the original games as kind of cheesy and too repetitive, let me assure you that the gameplay is so much more frightening and tense in VR. Unlike other horror games with stories that ease you into scary scenarios, FNaF:HW has nearly nonstop moments of tension. Plus, the mix of different gameplay mechanics from different games ensures that things feel more varied, and the Halloween DLC pack is excellent.Help Wanted 2 is a step up because they focused more on making an original VR game working at the Pizzaplex Salon, while still adding VR minigames from the mainline series like Sister Location. It feels like you can immerse yourself more in the world, instead of just lore cameos of other games' worlds. —Michael HicksGenotypeA Metroid Prime-esque experienceOne of our favorite Quest 3 launch games, Genotype is an FPS Metroidvania shooter set on an abandoned Arctic research base swarming with monsters. You're overtaken by deadly spores, but before you die, you can wield these invading organisms as unique weapons, fighting fire with fire.Each weapon operates very differently, and all can be swapped at will with a clever string mechanic — pull the string on your wrist and stop when the weapon you want pops up. It's similar to how character-switching works in Bonelab if you've had the opportunity to play that. And a February 2024 update added a bunch of new weaponized creatures, enemies, difficulty settings, and upgrades to increase replayability.Genotype has more polish than your typical VR game, from the voice acting and compelling story to the mechanics. And it looks fantastic on the Quest 3 thanks to its unique graphical update. If you're looking for a game to sink plenty of time into, start here! —Nick SutrichGorilla TagJoin the biggest party on the QuestRecapture the magic of chasing friends around on the playground, except as a low-resolution gorilla swinging from branches or leaping from buildings. The straightforward gameplay and free download have turned Gorilla Tag into one of the most popular games on the platform, especially among younger gamers.New game modes like Infection, Hunt, and Paintbrawl, the addition of six levels for variety, and monthly updates keep things fun on the regular. Plus, you can always find players looking to try custom minigames and make friends.You'll also collect \"shiny rocks\" to buy customizations and give your monkey a unique look. Don't be surprised if you end up sinking a ton of time into this free game, so long as you aren't scared off by voice chat.As the game's tagline says, it's time to \"become monke.\" —Michael HicksI Expect You to Die 1–3James Bond meets MacGuyverI'll always love 2016's I Expect You to Die, one of the first VR games I ever played. While it's still worth playing, its sequel I Expect You to Die 2 steps things up in terms of better graphics, more fun escape-the-room set pieces, amazing voice acting, and a blast of a story.Named after Goldfinger's iconic line to James Bond, IEYTD 2 makes the homage obvious with an amazing psychedelic intro complete with a ballad by Puddles Pity Party. You play as a secret agent who must navigate a series of escape room-like traps and scenarios, facing off against a nefarious foe voiced by Wil Wheaton. The sandbox-esque levels are full of objects you can pick up telekinetically and pull to you, and you never know what random item will save you from death.Be prepared to die a lot — the game does warn you — as you try to find unorthodox solutions to deadly situations by trial and error. At times frustrating and illogical, I Expect You to Die 2 feels triumphant when you finally find solutions — and if you keep a sense of humor, your deaths are frequently hilarious. The game is relatively short, but you can replay levels to find trophies and alternate solutions to puzzles that give you achievements.Then, of course, you have the trilogy bookend, I Expect You to Die 3, which keeps the same escape-room formula and excellent voice acting, but also the same seated gameplay instead of letting you explore deadly rooms yourself. I'd like to see Schell Games keep the aesthetics and quality but switch things up for future games. For now, though, this trilogy is a must-buy for puzzler fans. —Michael HicksKeep Talking and Nobody ExplodesA bomb in the living room? Defuse it, now!You're alone in a room with an elaborately armed bomb. Your colleagues off-site have acquired the codes used by the bomb-maker, but there's a ticking clock and no time for them to reach you and disarm it themselves. You have no choice: you must relay the complex mechanics of the bomb to them exactly, so they can tell you how to dismantle it in time. Make too many mistakes, or take too long to find the solution, and it's game over!Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a local couch co-op game. It's been around since the original Oculus Rift and since then has ported to Android, iOS, PC, Switch, Playstation, Xbox, PSVR, and Quest. The core gameplay hasn't changed, and you don't need to play this in VR; all you need is the free bomb manual, and to make sure that the one disarming the bomb can't see it from where they play. But this is a case where VR's natural isolation works in your favor: it makes you feel trapped with no escape, making the bomb's countdown that much more stressful.Gameplay is fairly straightforward. Each bomb has different modules with traps that can't be solved without the manual. One example: you see a module with five wires and tell your friends. They check the manual and ask you questions. Depending on the color and number of the wires, you'll need to cut a specific wire. Get it wrong, and you get a strike (three strikes equals BOOM).If you're trying to get your reluctant family members or roommates to try VR — and they find Beat Saber too intimidating — Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a great starting point. The gameplay is accessible and compelling, and the cartoonish vibes make it fun instead of overly serious. —Michael HicksLittle CitiesRelax as you build and expand cities in your virtual toyboxYour goal in Little Cities is simple: Build municipal districts on six different islands, unlocking new buildings and expanded real estate if you keep your little citizens happy with proper city structure. While there's \"strategy\" you need to follow to succeed as a city-builder, the stakes are much lower than in other stressful experiences. If a city isn't shaping up like you hoped, you can always take things apart and start over. This game doesn't have complex, game-changing mechanics. However, compared to Cities: VR, a city-building sim that struggled to translate its complex mechanics so they'd work well with Touch controllers, Little Cities' gameplay is comfortingly simple and works well with hand tracking alone. As our reviewer described the game, it's \"unabashedly joyful,\" with \"vibrant colors\" and cheerful mechanics like fireworks that go off whenever you level up. If you need a \"sugary, candy-coated piece of escapism,\" this is your game. Plus, it's already seen its first paid DLC, Snowy Islands, which adds new islands, buildings, attractions, and natural disasters so your little cities stay fresh and fittingly seasonal. —Michael HicksMedieval DynastyMany PC gamers love the 2020 release Medieval Dynasty which managed to carve out a popular niche for itself by combining a first-person action game and a strategy game into one holistic package. The VR release on the Meta Quest platform doesn't just attempt to port this experience into a VR perspective, it totally rebuilds the experience in a way that is built-for-VR.Like the flatscreen version, Medieval Dynasty New Settlement tasks players with surviving the harsh lifestyle of a medieval peasant. The game begins with you finding a new town to settle down in. You'll scavenge for food and water, harvest and hunt the land's resources, and make friends with people in the village. Once you build your first house, things greatly expand and the strategy aspect of the game really comes into play.Unlike most other strategy games on the platform, Medieval Dynasty New Settlement sees you walking around and doing everything with your hands. From chopping the wood to building the house, cooking the bricks, chopping the food, bartering with townsfolk, etc. It's very hands-on.Eventually, you'll grow your town into a city and then a \"medieval hub,\" as the description puts it, creating a true dynasty as the name of the game suggests. Co-op modes and other improvements like better fast travel systems are coming soon, too, and the game's developers have shown that they're committed to the Quest release for the foreseeable future. —Nick SutrichPistol WhipFor all the John Wicks out thereFrom the moment the first trailer dropped for Pistol Whip, I was fully on board. John Wick in VR? What's not to love about that?It's a simple concept, really: pull the trigger in time to the beat. Of course, problems arise when the bad guys shoot back, and pillars block your way, so the game fast becomes an aerobic exercise of side lunges, squats, and other shenanigans as you fight to stay alive. When you first start playing, the rhythm part of the game is hard to get into, but as you get used to the enemies' movement, you will start to hit some big scores.Since launch, we've seen two new campaign expansions: the futuristic Pistol Whip 2089 and the Old West Pistol Whip: Smoke and Thunder. Both are rather short story-wise but add new guns and varied challenges. The new Styles mode adds a massive amount of variety with challenging modifiers to old missions, like beating all the enemies without guns. Most recently, the Encore update added new modifiers and songs, along with a multiplayer Party Mode for competing with friends' scores under specific conditions.All in all, Pistol Whip is a fantastic game that truly shines on the Quest. The freedom to duck and weave without the constant concern for wires is very freeing, and the art style suits the power limitations of the Quest perfectly. I never feel sick playing, and there is never any frame rate slowdown, no matter how hectic it gets. If I could only play one game on the Meta Quest for the rest of time, it would be Pistol Whip. —James BricknellRacket ClubClubbing on a Friday night has a whole new meaningNever been to a real racket club? I haven't either, but I feel like I have after putting several hours into Racket Club, the made-for-VR social game that makes it easy to find other players and get an amazing social experience at the same time.Racket Club's gameplay is a fascinating mix between Pickleball and Racquetball, giving it a unique feel among other similar types of games. The game also supports passthrough, giving you full confidence that you won't smack something in your room on accident when you're really getting in on the action.In Racket Club, you can opt to play through a robust single-player campaign or join a truly compelling multiplayer experience. The single-player mode is great for outfitting your character with fresh gear, but it's the multiplayer club that's the meat of this experience.When you step out of the double doors of the clubhouse and into the courtyard, you'll find players roaming around looking for partners and opponents, alike. Each area has several Racket Club courts mixed between 1v1 and 2v2 sizes. You can walk right up to a court and jump in for practice, or just walk around chatting with people already playing a game.The social experience Racket Club creates is nothing short of magic, and it's downright cathartic to see and hear everyone else playing and having a good time while you attempt to defeat your opponent. I always say VR is best when it's social, and this is the perfect VR social experience! — Nick SutrichResident Evil 4 VRSomehow, this third-person game plays better ported to first-personYou can categorize this game as action, horror, or shooter, because it does well at all three. Resident Evil 4 masterfully converted the franchise from survival horror to a more action-packed experience (before 5 and 6 took things too far). Resident Evil 4 VR puts you in Leon's shoes, so when Ganados charge you with tentacles and chainsaws, it feels much more frightening than ever before. In the end, it's thanks to the new motion-control combat that shooting waves of foes feels incredibly satisfying, making VR the definitive way to play the classic game.Whatever genre it fits, Resident Evil remains a blast to play all these years later. Armature Studios converted it to first-person, so you can grab weapons, healing herbs, grenades, or your combat knife without having to pull up a menu, making the gameplay more seamless than ever. New spatial audio warns you when enemies are approaching from out of sight. You pick up loot and ammo yourself, as well as reload your weapons as quickly as possible while enemies bear down on you. Even your companion, Ashley, received an AI upgrade for this revamped VR port.Its graphics look a bit dated, but this benefits the game because it doesn't take up too much hard drive space while offering dozens of hours of gameplay. Plus, Mercenaries Mode — a horde mode in which you challenge waves of zombies as fan faves like Ada, Hunk, and Wesker — arrived as a free update with new tweaks and challenges. Whether you're a fan of the classic game or haven't experienced it before, Resident Evil 4 works impressively well in virtual reality. —Michael HicksThe Room VR: A Dark MatterAn excellent puzzle mystery that challenges and intrigues.I unfairly ignored The Room VR for years, assuming from the name that it would be a run-of-the-mill horror game. Referencing the escape room genre and coming from a popular franchise of 2D puzzle games, The Room VR turned out to be a fascinating, graphically impressive experience that strikes a good balance between making its puzzles challenging and intuitive.I could go into more detail about the game, but quite honestly, it's one that is best experienced without any spoilers and needs little introduction. It'll only last you about 5 hours or so, depending on how quickly you solve the puzzles, but don't let that dissuade you: it's short but very sweet. Plus, you can play several other The Room ports on Steam — though they're not available in VR, unfortunately.— Michael HicksSUPERHOTIt's like the first time you saw The Matrix, but you're NeoSUPERHOT isn't just some ordinary shooter in VR; it's a game that's been redesigned from the ground up with VR in mind, all while utilizing a concept that's wholly unique to SUPERHOT.SUPERHOT VR takes place in the dungeon-like computer room of a hacker — you — who utilizes floppies and a VR headset to hack into some obfuscated system. While it's not directly explained, the story looks to be a direct extension of what you'll experience in other SUPERHOT games like SUPERHOT: Mind Control Delete. It has a main campaign and various challenge modes.When you play it, you immediately understand what physical presence can lend to a concept like SUPERHOT. Sure, the base mechanics are the same — time moves when you move, so choose your movements wisely — but extending this concept to your actual body is what makes all the difference. When an enemy shoots at you, you can simply stop moving your arms to freeze time to a crawl and ponder how to escape the wave of bullets approaching you.SUPERHOT VR doesn't just make you feel like Neo from The Matrix; it makes you feel utterly invincible. —Nick SutrichSupernaturalThe best serious workout option on QuestThe biggest question most people have (once they realize Supernatural isn't a horror game) is whether it's worth the subscription cost after the 14-day free trial. It used to cost $179/year, so the current price of $9.99/month or $99/year is comparatively cheap...but still expensive compared to Apple Fitness+ or Fitbit Premium (both $79/year).What are you paying for? For starters, you get access to recorded coach-led daily workouts that give you advice and encouragement during each new routine. Different workouts target specific muscle groups and have different intensity levels or different types of music to encourage you. Unless the vague electronica soundtracks or paid DLC you get with most games, all content is available with the subscription.The gameplay is extremely similar to Beat Saber, but the app tracks specific metrics, like the force and extension of your arm thrusts or the depth of your squats, as a way to track your progress. You can connect your fitness tracker, so your heart rate is associated with the workout. And during my Quest fitness testing, Supernatural burned more calories than any other Quest game, making it extremely effective. In more recent years, Supernatural added a mixed-reality mode for Quest 3 users who want to keep their eye on kids or pets while working out. And if you have friends with Quests and want to hold each other accountable, you can play the Supernatural Together mode and perform the same workout simultaneously, knowing people will see your swipes and scores at the end to keep you motivated. Overall, if you're at all interested in VR exercise, I'd say Supernatural is worth the cost. —Michael HicksVacation Simulator \u0026 Job SimulatorGreat humor, tons of varied minigames, and brain-teasing puzzlesWe decided to group these two, not because they didn't deserve their own spots individually but because anyone who enjoys one will immediately want to invest in the other. Both games are set in a near-future dystopia where most of humanity has been replaced by robots who are now trying to recreate \"jobs\" and \"vacations\" to make the remaining humans happy — but are pretty bad at figuring out the specifics.Like a smart Pixar movie, these games have bright, cartoonish visuals and easy-to-grasp tasks that kids will enjoy while also employing smart jokes that'll get the biggest laughs out of adults. Some games have you complete tasks, solve puzzles, or design silly creations with the tools around you. Kids are encouraged to get creative, while anyone can hunt down secrets or waste hours on minigames. And the writing plays off of real-life in truly hilarious ways, especially in the free Vacation Simulator: Back to Job expansion.If you're looking for a game to start with, Vacation Simulator is a more complete and technically advanced experience. For the kids, Vacation Simulator has multiple saves and a \"small human\" mode that ensures the gameplay happens at the proper height for them. It also adds hand tracking, where Job Simulator relies on the Touch controllers to be your hands. And while Job Simulator keeps its gameplay focused on the arc directly in front of you, Vacation Simulator takes full advantage of wireless VR and encourages you to look in any direction. Still, Job Simulator is a great introduction to VR and a fun experience in its own right. —Michael HicksWalkabout Mini GolfFantastical mini golf courses like you imagined in your dreamsMini golf is all about fantastical themes, crazy course designs, and a whole lot of bantering. You'll find all of these things in Walkabout Mini Golf, the mini-golf game from mini-golf enthusiasts. Dozens of courses can be played by you and up to seven other friends. It's amazing what a round of golf can do to spur on a good conversation!Realistic physics makes the fascinating mix of realistic and wholly unrealistic courses even more fun than you might imagine, and challenging your friends only gets crazier when you unlock night mode. Along the way, you can find hundreds of missing balls to add to your collection, unlock new putters after beating the hard courses, solve puzzles, and find treasure. You can even play mini-golf in space!Coolest of all, Walkabout Mini Golf regularly adds new courses to freshen up the gameplay, including a Myst course with puzzles to solve, a Labyrinth course based on the classic film, and a Mars Gardens course with a low-gravity mode. There's nothing mini about this experience! And your non-VR friends can buy Walkabout Minigolf: Pocket Edition for mobile and play alongside you.If you really want to get into the game, pick up a HelloReal putter that's made specifically for Walkabout Mini-Golf and works with all the most popular VR golf games. It adds realistic weight to your swing, and I hate playing without it! —Nick SutrichWalking Dead: Saints and SinnersPost-apocalyptic New Orleans is a veritable hellscapeThe original Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners was a marvel of a game. Chapter 2 takes everything that was good about the original and turns it up to 11, giving you free rein of a post-apocalyptic New Orleans day and night — that’s an improvement over the original in which you could only traverse the streets during the day. Not only that, but your humble school bus abode has been expanded into the nearby crypts with shelves upon shelves filled to the brim with weapons, usable scraps, food, and just about anything you could want to get a good adventure started.TWD S\u0026S Ch 2 launched in November 2022 with a bevy of bugs that made it literally impossible to play. We even delayed our full review until the developer could iron things out since we couldn’t progress beyond a game-breaking bug early on in the game. But, after a month of patches and updates, the game is better than ever and even more impressive than the first entry, utilizing the power of the Quest 2 to bring about more detailed environments and brand-new gibbing mechanics that’ll have you satisfyingly slicing through zombies in different ways each time just to see what happens.Ch 2 takes the story portion of this action RPG to new heights. You’ll find more detailed dialog trees to choose from, multiple branching paths to explore, and what feels like a million new things to craft and find. It’s still got a bit of that weird physics jank that games like Bonelab suffer from but, so long as the occasional glitch or oddity doesn’t bug you too much, it’s a rewarding experience that’ll have you wondering why more VR games aren’t so in-depth.If you’re a Walking Dead superfan and absolutely must experience every last drop of the universe, the original Walking Dead: Saints \u0026 Sinners is still well worth playing. Otherwise, don’t worry too much about jumping headfirst into Ch 2. You’ll get a quick recap of the first game’s story at the beginning — including a lovely boat ride detailing the history of what happened in New Orleans after the zombies took over — and the game takes all the areas from the first and adds to them rather than fully replacing them. —Nick Sutrich Current page: Best Meta Quest games overall Next Page Best shooters and multiplayer Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Michael is Android Central's resident expert on wearables and fitness.

One side plays SWAT (Enforcers), the other side plays terrorists (Revolters). Revolters begin inside a building and have already planted a bomb. Meanwhile, Enforcers are charged with breaching the compound and disarming the bomb before it detonates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach round begins with a minute-or-so-long period where players can buy new gear and plan their attack or defense. Revolters have access to traps that can be set up in the building to ward off the Enforcers while the bomb\u0026#39;s timer ticks down.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Enforcers have access to gadgets like cloaking devices and drones that will help them infiltrate the building successfully. Plus, enforcers can rappel up and down walls and use breaching foam to detonate specific walls that can be used in a surprise attack.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s a ton of fun that involves teamwork and skill, and there\u0026#39;s always the team deathmatch mode if you just want to shoot it out for a few rounds. My only request is that the developers add in a squad mode so you can travel with your crew of friends. Otherwise, you\u0026#39;re looking at the most polished, impressive game launch we\u0026#39;ve seen in VR since Half-Life: Alyx. — \u003cem\u003eNick Sutrich\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"contractors-showdown-3\"\u003eContractors Showdown\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe VR battle royale you\u0026#39;ve been waiting for\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eContractors earns two spots on our best Quest games list: You\u0026#39;ll find Contractors under Multiplayer Shooters on the next page as a traditional FPS experience, but \u003ca data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/contractors-showdown-meta-quest-3\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/contractors-showdown-meta-quest-3\"\u003eContractors Showdown\u003c/a\u003e is for Battle Royale fans, and it excels at it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eContractors Showdown lets you play with triple the number of players as Population: One.

The Quest ports appeal to both types.

Unlike other horror games with stories that ease you into scary scenarios, FNaF:HW has nearly nonstop moments of tension. Plus, the mix of different gameplay mechanics from different games ensures that things feel more varied, and the Halloween DLC pack is excellent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHelp Wanted 2 is a step up because they focused more on making an original VR game working at the Pizzaplex Salon, while still adding VR minigames from the mainline series like Sister Location.

Once you build your first house, things greatly expand and the strategy aspect of the game really comes into play.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike most other strategy games on the platform, Medieval Dynasty New Settlement sees you walking around and doing everything with your hands. From chopping the wood to building the house, cooking the bricks, chopping the food, bartering with townsfolk, etc. It\u0026#39;s very hands-on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEventually, you\u0026#39;ll grow your town into a city and then a \u0026#34;medieval hub,\u0026#34; as the description puts it, creating a true dynasty as the name of the game suggests. Co-op modes and other improvements like better fast travel systems are coming soon, too, and the game\u0026#39;s developers have shown that they\u0026#39;re committed to the Quest release for the foreseeable future. —\u003cem\u003eNick Sutrich\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"pistol-whip-3\"\u003ePistol Whip\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor all the John Wicks out there\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom the moment the first trailer dropped for Pistol Whip, I was fully on board.

Armature Studios converted it to first-person, so you can grab weapons, healing herbs, grenades, or your combat knife without having to pull up a menu, making the gameplay more seamless than ever. New spatial audio warns you when enemies are approaching from out of sight. You pick up loot and ammo yourself, as well as reload your weapons as quickly as possible while enemies bear down on you.

Unless the vague electronica soundtracks or paid DLC you get with most games, all content is available with the subscription.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe gameplay is extremely similar to Beat Saber, but the app tracks specific metrics, like the force and extension of your arm thrusts or the depth of your squats, as a way to track your progress.
