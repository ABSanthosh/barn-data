  "text": "OnePlus recently unveiled its newest expansion to its Android phone lineup with the OnePlus Ace 5 Pro, a rather impressive handset that manages to check all the right boxes. It’s not exactly the OnePlus 13, but carries a lot of the same specs which make its flagship sibling a terrific choice for Android fans. READ: OnePlus 11R starts receiving the Android 15 update Upfront you’ll find a 6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED display, which also features a  120Hz refresh rate, a 2780×1264 pixel resolution, and up to 4,500 nits of peak brightness. The phone also comes with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, a flagship-tier SoC that’s accompanied with up to 1TB of internal storage, as well as 16GB of RAM. Android 15 runs the show here, although it’s injected with a heavy dose of ColorOS 15, in lieu of OxygenOS. There’s also a capable cooling system inside that OnePlus refers to as the “double ice core VC” system. There’s a 6,100 mAh battery with support for bypass charging as well as 100W charging speeds. Finally, the OnePlus Ace 5 Pro features a triple camera system with a 50MP main sensor, an 8MP ultrawide camera, and a 2MP macro sensor as well. Other details include support for WiFi 7, IP65 dust and water resistance, and three color variants including black, white, and purple. It’s priced starting at around $465 for the base model, although there’s no word yet of global availability.",
