  "text": "When Samsung announced its Galaxy AI, one of the AI features was Circle to Search. For non-Samsung smartphone owners who want that feature too, you’re in luck, especially if you own an Honor phone. This is because Honor has announced that some of its phones will be getting the Circle to Search feature as well. The feature will be arriving for devices like the Honor Magic V3, the Honor 200, and the Honor 200 Pro. For those unfamiliar, Circle to Search is basically like Google Lens, except it has been supercharged with AI capabilities. It allows users to circle any part of their phone’s display and it will use AI to help find the object in the video. This is useful if there’s something interesting on the screen, like a video you’re watching or a photo, and you want to know more about it. It’s actually a feature developed by Google as part of its Gemini AI. It was previously exclusive to Samsung phones and Google’s own Pixel devices. It later made its way onto Xiaomi’s smartphones, and now Honor is next in line to get Circle to Search. The update should be making its way to the select Honor devices as we speak, so if you own any of the Honor phones mentioned above, you should be able to access the feature soon.",
