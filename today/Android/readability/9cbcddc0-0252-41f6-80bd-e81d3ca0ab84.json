  "text": "3 rumors that make me excited for AMD's Radeon RX 90 series launch GPU Sign in to your XDA account AMD is gearing up to launch the Radeon RX 90 series graphics cards on February 28. This launch will be hot on the wheels of both Intel and Nvidia. The former is looking to penetrate the market with new affordable GPUs while Nvidia is doing what Nvidia does best ... rave on about AI and pack as much tech into expensive graphics cards as possible. Still, although the RTX 50 series launch left much to be desired, there's no doubt Nvidia has some beefy cards out and AMD needs to hit a home run to remain relevant. 3 A 32 GB GPU isn't coming ... or is it? AI and ever-increasing game workloads The rumor mill was churning away with a leak discussion surrounding a 32 GB AMD Radeon RX 90 series GPU. This would be an absolute unit for 4K (and higher-res) gaming, but AMD's Consumer and Gaming Marketing head Frank Azor shot the rumors down spectacularly on X. Does this mean AMD won't release a GPU with 32 GB of VRAM? Not quite. The company is clearly focusing on mid-range gaming cards and 32 GB of memory simply doesn't work within the segment. Where this additional VRAM can come in handy is with AI development and workstations, something AMD could tap into with RDNA 4. It may not be arriving for launch, but I wouldn't be surprised if an RDNA 4 AMD RX 90 series GPU comes out with plenty of RAM to handle advanced workloads. 2 Greatly improved FSR to compete with DLSS It'll be worth using FSR 4 in games AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution technology has been mixed at best. The company took a different approach to Nvidia, focusing more on software than machine learning and AI. It all sounded good at first but the limitations of software alone were apparent. AMD has worked magic with FSR 2 and FSR 3, but it needed to switch to machine learning and leverage the hardware of its graphics cards if it had any hope of keeping up with DLSS. Regardless of what you think of frame generation tech from Nvidia, there's no questioning how much of an impact DLSS has had on the gaming industry. AMD having an equivalent on its own cards will be great for fans. Throw in rock-solid driver support and AMD's renowned software improvements over the lifetime of a product and you've got a winning formula. 1 AMD Radeon RX 9070 for $649 would be great Although an accurate MSRP is still pending One thing AMD has been suspiciously quiet about is pricing. We have no idea how much the company's upcoming RX 90 series GPUs will cost. Some rumors have surfaced on the RX 9070 costing $649 though we have seen other reports on a $899 price tag. AMD's own Frank Azor shot down some MSRP rumors on X, so we should expect to see a price lower than $900 at least. Nvidia is holding out for AMD to launch its Geforce RTX 5070 and AMD delayed its RX 90 series launch due to a few reasons, one likely being Nvidia's pricing for its new generation of GeForce RTX 50 series. It's one giant mess, which is almost expected with the discrete graphics card market. Thankfully, Intel is putting both feet well and truly in with the excellently positioned Arc B series. February 28 couldn't come soon enough I'm excited about AMD's next generation of graphics cards for competition. Nvidia needs serious competition for its RTX 50 series and I believe a combination of AMD and Intel could provide precisely that for 2025. RDNA 4 and FSR 4 could be huge for the company's 9070 range of GPUs and depending on how they're priced against Nvidia, we could see quite the undercut. Related 5 reasons I'm excited about AMD's next GPUs AMD might be targeting the mid-range with its next-gen Radeon GPUs but that's okay by me",

The company took a different approach to Nvidia, focusing more on software than machine learning and AI. It all sounded good at first but the limitations of software alone were apparent. AMD has worked magic with FSR 2 and FSR 3, but it needed to switch to machine learning and leverage the hardware of its graphics cards if it had any hope of keeping up with DLSS.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of what you think of frame generation tech from Nvidia, there\u0026#39;s no questioning how much of an impact DLSS has had on the gaming industry.

We have no idea how much the company\u0026#39;s upcoming RX 90 series GPUs will cost. Some rumors have surfaced on the RX 9070 costing $649 though we have seen other reports on a $899 price tag. AMD\u0026#39;s own Frank Azor shot down some MSRP rumors on X, so we should expect to see a price lower than $900 at least.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eNvidia is holding out for AMD to launch its Geforce RTX 5070 and AMD delayed its RX 90 series launch due to a few reasons, one likely being Nvidia\u0026#39;s pricing for its new generation of GeForce RTX 50 series. It\u0026#39;s one giant mess, which is almost expected with the discrete graphics card market. Thankfully, Intel is putting both feet well and truly in with the excellently positioned Arc B series.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"february-28-couldn-39-t-come-soon-enough\"\u003e\n            February 28 couldn\u0026#39;t come soon enough\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m excited about AMD\u0026#39;s next generation of graphics cards for competition. Nvidia needs serious competition for its RTX 50 series and I believe a combination of AMD and Intel could provide precisely that for 2025. RDNA 4 and FSR 4 could be huge for the company\u0026#39;s 9070 range of GPUs and depending on how they\u0026#39;re priced against Nvidia, we could see quite the undercut.\u003c/p\u003e            \n
