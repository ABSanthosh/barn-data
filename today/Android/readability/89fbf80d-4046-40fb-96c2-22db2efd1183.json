Everyone likes to save money, because economically, most folks would opine that things aren't getting better for them. Savings and deals aren't always around for the taking, though, so the least anyone can hope for is that the prices of products they pay for don't climb unnecessarily. Unfortunately, things aren't as sweet in the real world as they are in our dreams. Digital services keep getting more expensive, and it looks like T-Mobile wants to be part of that little-desired club. Many of its plans used to have prices inclusive of taxes and fees, but that era is about to come to an abrupt end. That means paying more for cellular service. T-Mobile's Tablet, Smartwatch, and Hotspot Plans Will Now Have Taxes and Fees as an Added Cost Image: T-Mobile Back in April, T-Mobile introduced a new set of cellular plans under the Experience name. While the actual provisions of the plan weren't intrinsically bad, there was one thing that soured the taste, especially when compared to the company's previous Go5G offerings. That was that the stated price for the plans no longer had taxes and fees included, meaning that the final price you pay monthly ends up being higher than what you see. In regular people's parlance, you might refer to that as a “hidden fee”, and no one likes those—especially T-Mobile users who have had taxes and fees bundled since 2017. Unfortunately, T-Mobile is telling you to get used to the new normal, since it plans to expand its separate taxes and fees crusade to some of the few plans that managed to escape. This includes plans for: Tablet Smartwatch Hotspot These changes haven't taken effect just yet, but are expected to kick into action before the end of this week, according to The Mobile Report. Some of the site's sources say that it will kick in today, while others say after today. As of now, there's no change in the terms online, at least for the smartwatch and tablet plans. Existing Subscribers on These Plans Will Be Grandfathered In Image: T-Mobile If you happen to already be on any of the carrier's smartwatch, tablet, or hotspot plans, you won't need to worry about this change just yet. You will continue to be tax-free, which is cool. However, with most of these “grandfather” situations, things will eventually change. Best-case scenario, that could be in over a year, so at least there's that. T-Mobile's Home Internet Seems to Be the Only One to Escape Image: Peter Holden/TalkAndroid Out of all the plans and services that T-Mobile offers, it seems that the only one that will seem to escape the punishment of having taxes and fees paid as an extra charge is its home internet plan. In a few days, that could make it the only major T-Mobile service with your taxes and fees included in the advertised price. T-MobileAT\u0026TVerizonCheapest Unlimited Plan$55$65.99$65Taxes and Fees Included?NoNoNo Verizon and AT\u0026T have taxes and fees as an extra charge on top of what is advertised, so it isn't as if T-Mobile is the only offender. However, as the last one out of the stables, T-Mobile's move shifts the postpaid carrier space into a rather unfriendly position.
