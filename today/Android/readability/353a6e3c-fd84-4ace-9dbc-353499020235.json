Here is the latest report from TechManiacs. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 will be significantly thinner than its 2024 predecessor. How much thinner? Previous info suggests 4.5mm unfolded and 9.5mm folded. This latest report claims it will be even thinner – only 8.2mm folded! Take this with a grain of salt as it would mean that Samsung would leapfrog the competition – the Oppo Find N5 is 8.9mm folded for example. The Korean company would have to significantly improve on its current best attempt, the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition, which is 10.6mm. Anyway, the Z Fold7 will have a 200MP main camera like the Special Edition, but the telephoto (3x 10MP) and ultra-wide (12MP) will not be improved. The inner display is expected to grow to 8”, up from 7.6” on the Z Fold6. The cover display will go from 6.3” to 6.5”. These dimensions match the Special Edition. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 will have a larger cover display – growing from a folder-shaped 3.4” panel to an almost rectangular 4” panel. The Z Flip will also be thinner than its predecessor, but there are no concrete numbers in this report. It will have a larger battery, though, growing from 4,000mAh to 4,300mAh (no, charge speeds will not be increased). The camera system isn’t getting a 200MP upgrade – in fact, it sounds like Samsung will reuse the 50+12MP setup from the Z Flip6. Both phones will be powered by Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy (the Z Flip SE or whatever it is called will get an Exynos 2400e). Finally, the report has some bad news – the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 is expected to get a €100 price hike compared to its predecessor. For reference, the Z Fold6 launched at €2,000. No news is good news regarding the Z Flip7 price, we suppose. Source (in Greek)",
