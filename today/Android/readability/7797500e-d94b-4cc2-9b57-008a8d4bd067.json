Earlier in January, CES 2025 showed us the best of Anker as they focused on high-power laptop chargers, smart energy solutions under Anker Solix, and mobile charging tech from their high-power lineup. We saw versatile power banks, multi-port chargers, and real-time smart displays. Some of these new products are currently on sale at an early bird offer and are worth checking out. Shop the 25K Anker Powerbank and 140W Charger for less For a limited time, Anker is offering great discounts to allow you to cop the 25,000mAh (25K) 165W power bank for £69.99 (~ $72) instead of £89.99 (~ $94). Meanwhile, the 140W, 4-Port charger is available for £74.99 (~ $78), reduced from £89.99 (~$94). If you’re entirely new to Anker, you can get 12% off your first purchase if you sign up for their emails on the official website. So, the power bank would drop to £61.59 (≈ $64), and the charger would go down to £65.99 (≈ $69). It's quite the save for a few clicks. Image: Anker The power bank has a higher power output, with enough wattage to charge your laptops, phones, and more. The 165W total output is also enough speed to deliver fast charging to multiple devices simultaneously. Again, it's bigger and heavier, weighing around 595g. The charger is more compact and lighter at 295g. Both devices have physical buttons, three USB-A and one USB-C port, and support ActiveShield 2.0 technology, which Anker says is to help monitor temperature to prevent overheating. They also share screens that show temperature and charging levels, so you don't obsessively check your phone to see the information. Related: CES 2025 Brings Exciting Anker Smart Home Devices \u0026 Speakers Should you buy Anker's high-charging solutions? Anker’s 25K power bank and 140W charger are impressive products. Having a charger with four ports is nice, and you won't need to struggle for multiple outlets wherever you are. The power bank's sheet specifications are also convincing enough, especially considering how hard it is to find a good laptop power bank. Image: Anker Most power banks aren’t strong enough to charge laptops as they need much higher wattage. Some laptops also need USB-C PD 3.1 or other specific charging standards, which not all power banks support. If the power bank isn’t a good match, it might charge too slowly or not at all. Anker has broken past the usual limitations and even given you a modern design. The retractable cables are a significant plus to keep your cables neat and free from tangles. One of them even doubles as a lanyard you can grab to make carrying the power bank easier. Anker promises it can withstand up to 20,000 retractions and stretch to 70cm. That's about the length between your knee and your waist if you’re standing, enough to use your phone while charging from a distance. Overall, the pros outweigh the cons of charging solutions and make them worth the purchase. You can get them directly from Anker's website.
