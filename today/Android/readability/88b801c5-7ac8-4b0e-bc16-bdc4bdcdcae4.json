The Honor Magic V5 is thus billed as incredibly tough despite being a foldable. It comes with a 7.95-inch 2172x2352 LTPO AMOLED folding screen, a 6.43-inch 1060x2376 cover display, the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, 12/16GB of RAM, 256GB/512GB/1TB of storage, and a 5,820 mAh battery with support for 66W wired and 50W wireless charging. It has a 50 MP main camera with OIS, a 64 MP periscope telephoto with 3x optical zoom, a 50 MP ultrawide with autofocus, and a couple of 20 MP selfie cameras.",
