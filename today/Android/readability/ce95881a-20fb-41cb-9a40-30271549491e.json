The stars of the show will be on the back, however. The device is allegedly going to have a 200 MP main camera using Samsung's ISOCELL HP5 sensor, a 50 MP ultrawide, and a 50 MP telephoto with 3.5x optical zoom - both of these using the same ISOCELL JN5 sensor. As rumored before, the Galaxy S25 Slim is once again said not to be releasing alongside the rest of the Galaxy S25 family. While it may very well be showcased at their launch event in late January, the Slim will allegedly join them in stores in the second quarter of next year, so sometime between April and June.",
