The console is among the highest-selling home consoles of all-time, and much of that is due to the fantastic games that were available for it. But not every game in the PS2 library gets enough credit for being good compared to some of the more iconic and popular games that were released during its lifespan. Some cult hits find their audience a long time after they are initially released, with positive word of mouth exposing them to more people. Those kinds of games shouldn't be forgotten and deserve to have a modern remaster on newer consoles. But which games were often ignored back then, yet good enough for everyone to revisit later on? Gamers might have totally overlooked these games at first glance, but may have also come back to appreciate what experiences they offered years later. That's what makes the PS2 library so interesting to explore, with its diverse lineup of titles that defined a beloved era of gaming. Here are 4 PlayStation 2 games that were overlooked but deserve to have a modern remaster on current generation consoles. Related The 5 rarest PlayStation 2 games you may never own These PlayStation 2 games are so rare and expensive that you may never get a chance to own them. Here's why they're so elusive! 4 The Bouncer A brawler with Square's unique fashion One of the first PlayStation 2 games to come out following the console's release, The Bouncer is a unique game. It was developed at a time when Squaresoft, now known as Square Enix, was mostly known for their epic role-playing games like Final Fantasy, which dominated the original PlayStation library for RPGs. However, The Bouncer was a brawler-style action game that had a similar presentation to a Final Fantasy title, with eccentric characters and a dramatic plot. Players control one of three characters: Scion, Vol, and Kou, as they progress through stages populated by enemies. Fighting and defeating them would yield points to spend on upgrades like new moves, attack boosts, and more. The Bouncer had a lukewarm reception upon its release, with many praising its cutscenes and presentation over the gameplay. Square at the time had a heavy focus on cinematic storytelling, trying to blend gameplay visuals with movie-like scenes in an attempt to give a unique experience to players. And while the technology of the time was limited, the development team made a good effort to accomplish that goal. Since then, The Bouncer has not gotten a remastered version for new consoles, despite many Square Enix fans wanting to see the game be re-released. With some quality-of-life tweaks to the gameplay, and a few touchups to the visuals, The Bouncer could have a good return to the spotlight for long-time fans of Square Enix games. 3 NBA Street An ode to street-style basketball Source: Electronic Arts During the 90s and early 2000s, arcade sports games were a big crazy for many gamers. Even those who weren't into playing real sports, or watching them on television, often played sports games. NBA Street was one of the few arcade-style titles that drew a lot of attention for its unique approach to the game of basketball. Instead of going the simulation route like other major NBA titles have done before, NBA Street takes on the theme of street basketball and meshes it with easy arcade controls, with an emphasis on style and flair on the court. Style points for dribbling and passing with finesse reward players with a game-breaking shot that can clinch the game. The combination of street culture and basketball goes back a long time, so it was an attractive new direction for fans looking to play a basketball game on PlayStation 2. Although NBA Street helped jumpstart the series of \"street sports\" games that were made under the EA BIG label, the game itself never saw a remaster beyond that. Basketball fans over the years, including those who love NBA Live and NBA 2K titles, have wanted to see NBA Street make some sort of comeback in the modern era. Some fan projects have attempted to keep the love for the game alive with mods through emulation on PC, but Electronic Arts has yet to revisit the games from the EA BIG era. If there's one game from back then that deserves an HD remaster on current consoles, it's most definitely NBA Street.

That is the feeling one gets when playing The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction on the PS2, with its sandbox approach to the title character. The game was released in 2005 by Radical Entertainment, putting the Hulk in an open world setting with destructible environments and telling an original story. The plot involves Bruce Banner trying to put together a device to fix his damaged mind and prevent the change to his aggressive alter-ego. Like the Hulk, players can traverse long distances and undertake missions to advance the story, while also taking time in-between to just \"hulk out\" whenever they like. Buildings, vehicles, and other structures are completely destructible, which can draw the attention of the military, which will chase Hulk relentlessly with heavy firepower. The game has a lot of similarities to other open world titles of the time, which are often inspired by the Grand Theft Auto series. For fans of Marvel Comics, it's a quintessential game for the character, embodying nearly every aspect that fans love about Hulk. Unfortunately, it has not been released on digital storefronts or received an HD remaster of any kind. The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction is also notable for not being a movie tie-in game, as it was released around the same time as the film The Incredible Hulk from 2008. While the movie had a separate tie-in game, many fans feel that Radical Entertainment's Hulk game was far better overall. 1 Castlevania: Lament of Innocence The first Belmont without a remaster The Castlevania franchise has been getting a lot of attention after the release of the Netflix animated series. But while the original Castlevania on the NES is the first game of the series, it's not the canonical start of the timeline for the franchise. The very start of the clash between Dracula and the Belmont clan goes back further, and is told in Castlevania: Lament of Innocence for the PlayStation 2 in 2003. The game follows the story of Leon Belmont, the first Belmont to wield the Vampire Killer whip and face Dracula to save his fiancé. Lament of Innocence is a 3D action game, but it has many similar elements to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night with its exploration, character leveling through combat, and more. There's a lot of backtracking through areas to advance the story, but also a variety of enemies to slay as Leon makes his way to his confrontation with Dracula. Upon release, Castlevania: Lament of Innocence was received well by fans and critics. In different entries of the Castlevania series, the game is often referenced as part of the history and backstory of the franchise, with Leon being brought up from time to time. The Castlevania Netflix animated series does the same thing during its first season. While Castlevania: Lament of Innocence was re-released once for Japan, it has not been remastered by Konami in other territories since then. The company has been remastering a variety of Castlevania titles since the Netflix series became popular, but has yet to revisit Castlevania: Lament of Innocence or its sequel Castlevania: Curse of Darkness. But with so many entries in the series being revisited as of late, it may be only a matter of time before Castlevania: Lament of Innocence is given the same kind of treatment. PS2 games getting their due There are many more games within the PlayStation 2 library that deserve more credit for being good. The number of games developed for the console was staggering because of the large base of players in that era. However, not every game is going to warrant a remaster or re-release on newer consoles, mostly due to the lack of notoriety among players today. But certain parts of the PS2 library will eventually get reintroduced to newer gamers as more people continue to discuss them over the years. At some point, those overlooked PlayStation 2 games will get their due and the credit they really deserve.

It didn't just change gaming, but how people engaged with all media.",

It was developed at a time when Squaresoft, now known as Square Enix, was mostly known for their epic \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/final-fantasy-games-newcomers-need-play/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erole-playing games like \u003cem\u003eFinal Fantasy\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, which dominated the original PlayStation library for RPGs. However, \u003cem\u003eThe Bouncer\u003c/em\u003e was a brawler-style action game that had a similar presentation to a \u003cem\u003eFinal Fantasy\u003c/em\u003e title, with eccentric characters and a dramatic plot. Players control one of three characters: Scion, Vol, and Kou, as they progress through stages populated by enemies. Fighting and defeating them would yield points to spend on upgrades like new moves, attack boosts, and more.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Bouncer\u003c/em\u003e had a lukewarm reception upon its release, with many praising its cutscenes and presentation over the gameplay. Square at the time had a heavy focus on cinematic storytelling, trying to blend gameplay visuals with movie-like scenes in an attempt to give a unique experience to players. And while the technology of the time was limited, the development team made a good effort to accomplish that goal. Since then, \u003cem\u003eThe Bouncer\u003c/em\u003e has not gotten a remastered version for new consoles, despite many Square Enix fans wanting to see the game be re-released. With some quality-of-life tweaks to the gameplay, and a few touchups to the visuals, \u003cem\u003eThe Bouncer\u003c/em\u003e could have a good return to the spotlight for long-time fans of Square

During the 90s and early 2000s, arcade sports games were a big crazy for many gamers. Even those who weren\u0026#39;t into playing real sports, or watching them on television, often played \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/greatest-snes-sports-games-for-every-sport-on-super-nintendo/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esports games\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cem\u003eNBA Street\u003c/em\u003e was one of the few arcade-style titles that drew a lot of attention for its unique approach to the game of basketball. Instead of going the simulation route like other major NBA titles have done before, \u003cem\u003eNBA Street\u003c/em\u003e takes on the theme of street basketball and meshes it with easy arcade controls, with an emphasis on style and flair on the court. Style points for dribbling and passing with finesse reward players with a game-breaking shot that can clinch the game. The combination of street culture and basketball goes back a long time, so it was an attractive new direction for fans looking to play a basketball game on PlayStation 2.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eAlthough \u003cem\u003eNBA Street\u003c/em\u003e helped jumpstart the series of \u0026#34;street sports\u0026#34; games that were made under the EA BIG label, the game itself never saw a remaster beyond that. Basketball fans over the years, including those who love \u003cem\u003eNBA Live\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eNBA 2K\u003c/em\u003e titles, have wanted to see \u003cem\u003eNBA Street\u003c/em\u003e make some sort of comeback in the modern era. Some fan projects have attempted to keep the love for the game alive with mods through emulation on PC, but Electronic Arts has yet to revisit the games from the EA BIG era. If there\u0026#39;s one game from back then that deserves an HD remaster on current consoles, it\u0026#39;s most definitely \u003cem\u003eNBA Street\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n

\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Just two words can resonate with every comic book fan around: HULK SMASH. That is the feeling one gets when playing \u003cem\u003eThe Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction\u003c/em\u003e on the PS2, with its sandbox approach to the title character. The game was released in 2005 by Radical Entertainment, putting the Hulk in an open world setting with destructible environments and telling an original story. The plot involves Bruce Banner trying to put together a device to fix his damaged mind and prevent the change to his aggressive alter-ego. Like the Hulk, players can traverse long distances and undertake missions to advance the story, while also taking time in-between to just \u0026#34;hulk out\u0026#34; whenever they like. Buildings, vehicles, and other structures are completely destructible, which can draw the attention of the military, which will chase Hulk relentlessly with heavy firepower.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe game has a lot of similarities to other open world titles of the time, which are often inspired by the \u003cem\u003eGrand Theft Auto\u003c/em\u003e series. For fans of \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/ways-marvel-rivals-real-overwatch-successor/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMarvel Comics\u003c/a\u003e, it\u0026#39;s a quintessential game for the character, embodying nearly every aspect that fans love about Hulk. Unfortunately, it has not been released on digital storefronts or received an HD remaster of any kind. \u003cem\u003eThe Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction\u003c/em\u003e is also notable for not being a movie tie-in game, as it was released around the same time as the film \u003cem\u003eThe Incredible Hulk\u003c/em\u003e from 2008. While the movie had a separate tie-in game, many fans feel that Radical Entertainment\u0026#39;s Hulk game was far better overall.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"castlevania-lament-of-innocence\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e1 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Castlevania: Lament of Innocence\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"the-first-belmont-without-a-remaster\"\u003e\n            The first Belmont without a remaster\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eCastlevania\u003c/em\u003e franchise has been getting a lot of attention after the release of the Netflix animated series. But while the original \u003cem\u003eCastlevania\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/best-nes-games-of-all-time/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon the NES\u003c/a\u003e is the first game of the series, it\u0026#39;s not the canonical start of the timeline for the franchise. The very start of the clash between Dracula and the Belmont clan goes back further, and is told in \u003cem\u003eCastlevania: Lament of Innocence\u003c/em\u003e for the PlayStation 2 in 2003. The game follows the story of Leon Belmont, the first Belmont to wield the Vampire Killer whip and face Dracula to save his fiancé. \u003cem\u003eLament of Innocence\u003c/em\u003e is a 3D action game, but it has many similar elements to \u003cem\u003eCastlevania: Symphony of the Night\u003c/em\u003e with its exploration, character leveling through combat, and more. There\u0026#39;s a lot of backtracking through areas to advance the story, but also a variety of enemies to slay as Leon makes his way to his confrontation with Dracula.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eUpon release, \u003cem\u003eCastlevania: Lament of Innocence\u003c/em\u003e was received well by fans and critics. In different entries of the \u003cem\u003eCastlevania\u003c/em\u003e series, the game is often referenced as part of the history and backstory of the franchise, with Leon being brought up from time to time. The \u003cem\u003eCastlevania\u003c/em\u003e Netflix animated series does the same thing during its first season. While \u003cem\u003eCastlevania: Lament of Innocence\u003c/em\u003e was re-released once for Japan, it has not been remastered by Konami in other territories since then. The company has been remastering a variety of \u003cem\u003eCastlevania\u003c/em\u003e titles since the Netflix series became popular, but has yet to revisit \u003cem\u003eCastlevania: Lament of Innocence\u003c/em\u003e or its sequel \u003cem\u003eCastlevania: Curse of Darkness\u003c/em\u003e. But with so many entries in the series being revisited as of late, it may be only a matter of time before \u003cem\u003eCastlevania: Lament of Innocence\u003c/em\u003e is given the same kind of treatment.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"ps2-games-getting-their-due\"\u003e\n            PS2 games getting their due\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many more games within the PlayStation 2 library that deserve more credit for being good. The number of games developed for the console was staggering because of the large base of players in that era. However, not every game is going to warrant a remaster or re-release on newer consoles, mostly due to the lack of notoriety among players today. But certain parts of the PS2 library will eventually get reintroduced to newer gamers as more people continue to discuss them over the years.
