It was quietly launched by the brand in Thailand, where it's available to purchase for THB 29,990, which at the current exchange rates translates into $890 or €857. For that amount of cash, you're getting a single Phantom Black colorway. The device measures 163.8 x 76.8 x 8.9 mm and weighs 225g. The dimensions are identical to those of the ROG Phone 9 and ROG Phone 9 Pro, but the FE is 2g lighter. The ROG Phone 9 FE is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, paired with 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage. It has a 6.78-inch 1080x2400 LTPO AMOLED touchscreen with 2,500-nit peak brightness and 185 Hz refresh rate in Game Genie, 165 Hz in system settings, and 120 Hz everywhere else. On top there's Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2. The rear camera system comprises a 50 MP main snapper with Sony's IMX890 1/1.56\" type sensor with gimbal OIS, a 13 MP ultrawide with 120° field-of-view, and a 5 MP macro camera. Selfies are taken care of by a 32 MP shooter. The ROG Phone 9 FE has dual stereo speakers, an in-display fingerprint sensor, IP68 certification for dust and water resistance, and a 5,500 mAh battery with support for 65W wired charging. There's also support for wireless charging and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. The phone runs Android 15 with ROG UI. Now that it's been launched in one country, we expect it to quickly make its way to many others. As the FE suffix implies, this is meant to be a cheaper alternative to the ROG Phone 9 and ROG Phone 9 Pro, while still being part of the same family. Source (in Thai) | Via",
