  "text": "If you use a Mac, you’ve likely seen the little Time Machine icon in your menu bar and ignored it until disaster struck. For years, I relied on external drives or my primary server for backups, but I wanted something more flexible, inexpensive, and energy-efficient. That’s when I turned to a Raspberry Pi. With a bit of setup and the right software, I created a network Time Machine backup solution that just works quietly in the background. Setting this up not only saved me from purchasing additional proprietary storage options, but it also gave me peace of mind without adding another bulky device to my setup. And the best part? It didn’t require any complicated hardware or obscure configuration hacks. If you’ve got a Raspberry Pi and a Mac, you’re already halfway there. Related Why I chose a Raspberry Pi Affordable, flexible, and always on Unlike my MacBook, the Pi can stay on 24/7 without running up the electricity bill The Raspberry Pi makes an ideal candidate for a Time Machine backup target because it’s low-power and unobtrusive. I used a Pi 4 with 4GB of RAM, but even the 2GB model would work fine for this purpose. Its USB 3.0 ports allow me to connect a fast external drive without worrying about sluggish backups. And unlike my MacBook, the Pi can stay on 24/7 without running up the electricity bill. Flexibility is another big win. I didn’t need to reconfigure my whole network or buy a new NAS. With Samba and a little tuning, the Pi can broadcast itself as a Time Machine-compatible share over SMB. Since it runs Linux, I can also install other utilities, such as rsync, or integrate it with my existing Home Assistant setup if I want to monitor backup status. This approach also aligns well with my overall philosophy of minimizing vendor lock-in. I’m not stuck with a specific model of backup disk, and I’m not relying on iCloud or an expensive Time Capsule. My backups are local, recoverable, and independent of Apple’s whims. Setting up the Time Machine server Installing Samba and configuring SMB shares I started with a clean Raspberry Pi OS installation and ensured my system was fully updated. The key package for this project is Samba, which allows Linux machines to share folders over a network in a way that macOS can recognize. After installing it with a quick sudo apt install samba samba-common, I created a dedicated backup folder on my attached external drive and adjusted permissions accordingly. Next came the critical part: editing the smb.conf file to add a Time Machine-compatible share. This required setting the right flags, specifically fruit:time machine = yes and vfs objects = catia fruit streams_xattr, to mimic the behavior of Apple’s proprietary sharing protocol. It’s a little finicky, but there are great resources available with sample configurations that make it easier to get it right the first time. Once Samba was restarted, my Mac could see the Pi’s backup share by clicking the + icon in System Settings -\u003e General -\u003e Time Machine. After connecting and authenticating, I pointed Time Machine to the drive, and it started backing up without complaint. It really is that simple, provided you take the time to fine-tune the settings. Performance and reliability over time What surprised me after weeks of use Once I had everything running, I was curious how well this little DIY solution would hold up over time. I’ve now been using it for a couple of months, and I’m pleasantly surprised. Backups happen reliably in the background, even over Wi-Fi. The Pi hasn’t crashed once, and I can check on disk usage or performance remotely via SSH if needed. The first backup took some time, but subsequent incremental backups are much quicker. I also appreciate being able to automate snapshots and syncs using cron jobs or other command-line tools. It’s easy to integrate with my wider network and doesn’t feel like a hack or compromise, which is more than I can say for some of the third-party NAS solutions I’ve tested before. One minor downside is that Time Machine over SMB doesn’t support encryption unless you format the external disk with APFS and handle encryption from the Mac side. That wasn’t a dealbreaker for me, but it’s worth keeping in mind if you’re handling sensitive data. What could go wrong (and how to fix it) Common issues and how I solved them The most common problem people hit is macOS failing to recognize the Time Machine target. In my case, it happened once when I updated the Pi, and Samba got reset. I just double-checked the smb.conf settings and made sure the backup share was still available. Restarting Samba usually does the trick. The most common issue you might run into when setting up your Raspberry Pi as a Time Machine backup server is macOS failing to recognize the Time Machine target. Fixing this usually requires nothing more than confirming your smb.conf file is correct. Another hiccup involved permissions. macOS is particular about ownership and file access, so it’s essential to ensure the user account on the Pi has proper access to the backup folder. Running chown and chmod correctly will save you a ton of frustration. Also, don’t forget to set a reasonable size limit on the backup share to prevent it from swallowing your whole disk. Finally, don’t skimp on the power supply or cooling. If your Pi browns out or overheats during a backup, you could end up with corrupt data. A decent USB-C power brick and a small heatsink or fan go a long way toward maintaining stability. Why this still beats other options Time Capsule nostalgia, but better and cheaper Some folks might wonder why you’d go to this trouble when you can buy a used Time Capsule or set up iCloud backups. I get it, but for me, the Pi offers more flexibility and control. I can choose the exact drive I want, manage retention policies, and even use the same Pi for other services, such as Pi-hole or WireGuard VPN. I also don’t love being tied to Apple’s ecosystem more than I need to be. With this setup, I can migrate the disk, change hardware, or even switch to an entirely different backup method later without having to go through a bunch of hoops. It’s my data, and I want to be the one managing it. Best of all, this setup didn’t cost me more than $60 in total, including the Pi and the case. That’s a lot less than a new NAS or Apple’s official offerings—and it’s already paid for itself in peace of mind and flexibility. It’s easy to build your own You don’t need a background in Linux to set this up. The guides available are clear, and most of the work involves copying and pasting a few well-documented configuration files. The Raspberry Pi is more than capable, and once you’ve got it running, it just works. If you already own a Raspberry Pi and a spare external hard drive, you’re almost ready to go. For Mac users seeking an affordable, flexible, and local backup solution, this approach makes a great deal of sense. I’d do it again in a heartbeat. Raspberry Pi 5",

This required setting the right flags, specifically \u003ccode\u003efruit:time machine = yes\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003evfs objects = catia fruit streams_xattr\u003c/code\u003e, to mimic the behavior of Apple’s proprietary sharing protocol. It’s a little finicky, but there are great resources available with sample configurations that make it easier to get it right the first time.\u003c/p\u003e    \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                                        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/viewing-raspberry-pi-samba-shares.png\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\"\u003e\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n        \u003cpicture\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n                        \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/viewing-raspberry-pi-samba-shares.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/viewing-raspberry-pi-samba-shares.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n                        \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/viewing-raspberry-pi-samba-shares.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/viewing-raspberry-pi-samba-shares.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n                        \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/viewing-raspberry-pi-samba-shares.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/viewing-raspberry-pi-samba-shares.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n                        \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/viewing-raspberry-pi-samba-shares.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/viewing-raspberry-pi-samba-shares.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n                \u003cimg width=\"1974\" height=\"1134\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"viewing Raspberry Pi Samba shares\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/viewing-raspberry-pi-samba-shares.png\" src=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/viewing-raspberry-pi-samba-shares.png\"/\u003e\n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n                                    \n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce Samba was restarted, my Mac could see the Pi’s backup share by clicking the \u003cstrong\u003e+\u003c/strong\u003e icon in \u003cstrong\u003eSystem Settings -\u0026gt; General -\u0026gt; Time Machine\u003c/strong\u003e.

I’ve now been using it for a couple of months, and I’m pleasantly surprised. Backups happen reliably in the background, even over Wi-Fi. The Pi hasn’t crashed once, and I can check on disk usage or performance remotely via SSH if needed.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe first backup took some time, but subsequent incremental backups are much quicker. I also appreciate being able to automate snapshots and syncs using cron jobs or other command-line tools. It’s easy to integrate with my wider network and doesn’t feel like a hack or compromise, which is more than I can say for some of the third-party NAS solutions I’ve tested before.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOne minor downside is that Time Machine over SMB doesn’t support encryption unless you format the external disk with APFS and handle encryption from the Mac side.

In my case, it happened once when I updated the Pi, and Samba got reset.

Fixing this usually requires nothing more than confirming your \u003ccode\u003esmb.conf \u003c/code\u003efile is correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \n        \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother hiccup involved permissions. macOS is particular about ownership and file access, so it’s essential to ensure the user account on the Pi has proper access to the backup folder. Running \u003ccode\u003echown\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003echmod\u003c/code\u003e correctly will save you a ton of frustration. Also, don’t forget to set a reasonable size limit on the backup share to prevent it from swallowing your whole disk.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFinally, don’t skimp on the power supply or cooling. If your Pi browns out or overheats during a backup, you could end up with corrupt data.
