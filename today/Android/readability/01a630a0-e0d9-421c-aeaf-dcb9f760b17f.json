These phones feature a major focus on cameras, including the selfie, inside a premium overall package that is very solid, even if sometimes short on flagship features, and topped off by an eye-catching design. The vivo V40 is no different. It has plenty in common with its predecessor V30, but it also manages to upgrade most key areas iteratively. The camera remains the main focus of the experience with a new 50MP main snapper, now infused with Zeiss optics. It is accompanied by a familiar autofocusing 50MP ultrawide and a third autofocusing 50MP selfie camera. vivo V40 specs at a glance: Body: 164.2x75.0x7.6mm, 190g; Glass front, plastic frame, glass back; IP68/IP69 dust/water resistant (up to 1.5m for 30 min). Display: 6.78\" AMOLED, HDR10+, 120Hz, 4500 nits (peak), 1260x2800px resolution, 20:9 aspect ratio, 453ppi. Chipset: Qualcomm SM7550-AB Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 (4 nm): Octa-core (1x2.63 GHz Cortex-A715 \u0026 3x2.4 GHz Cortex-A715 \u0026 4x1.8 GHz Cortex-A510); Adreno 720. Memory: 128GB 8GB RAM, 256GB 8GB RAM, 256GB 12GB RAM, 512GB 12GB RAM; UFS 2.2. OS/Software: Android 14, Funtouch 14. Rear camera: Wide (main): 50 MP, f/1.9, 24mm, 1/1.56\", 1.0µm, PDAF, OIS; Ultra wide angle: 50 MP, f/2.0, 15mm, 119-degree, 1/2.76\", 0.64µm, AF. Front camera: 50 MP, f/2.0, 21mm (wide), 1/2.76\", 0.64µm, AF. Video capture: Rear camera: 4K@30fps, 1080p@30fps, gyro-EIS, OIS; Front camera: 4K@30fps, 1080p@30fps. Battery: 5500mAh; 80W wired, PD, Reverse wired. Connectivity: 5G; eSIM; Dual SIM; Wi-Fi 5; BT 5.4; NFC. Misc: Fingerprint reader (under display, optical); stereo speakers. The vivo V40 sure is a looker. Its back is bound to be polarizing with its new camera island design and a finish that feels like velvety sandpaper. Up front, we still get a gorgeous 6.78-inch, aggressively curved, 120Hz AMOLED display - not that common now that flatter designs are all the rage. Comparing the V40 with its predecessor, we also can't fail to notice the bigger 5,500 mAh battery, the improved IP68/69 ingress protection and the newfound stereo speaker setup. All very useful additions in their own right. Other than that, the V40 is still based on the familiar Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipset with either 8GB or 12GB of RAM and 128GB, 256GB or 512GB of UFS 2.2 storage. We will still test its performance just as well. Before we delve into any device specifics, let's do a quick unboxing. Unboxing The vivo V40 comes in a pretty simple two-piece cardboard box. It is black with a colorful ring on top, making it quite eye-catching. The box itself is decently sturdy. There is a plastic cradle on the inside to house the phone itself, which might not be very eco-friendly but should help keep it safe in transit. Our box also contains a very nice, thick, soft plastic case color-matched with the phone itself. Besides that, we only got a Type-C to Type-C cable. There was no charger, which is is something new for vivo phones. A slight consolation is that some regions will get a bundled charger so do check with your retailer. By the way, the vivo V40 Pro, which we received for review as as well, still comes with a charger.",
