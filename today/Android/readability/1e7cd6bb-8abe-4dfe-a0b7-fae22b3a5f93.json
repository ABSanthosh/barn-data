  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account It wasn't that long ago that Samsung teased its first foldable phone during the launch of the Galaxy 10. While it would provide just a glimpse of what's to come, the actual retail release for the phone wouldn't happen until way later. We saw Samsung use this same play at the beginning of the year with the Galaxy 25 Edge, and we're now getting word that it might do the same for its upcoming trifold phone. Related We know that the trifold phone is something the brand has been working on, and while the details have been scarce, we could end up getting our first look at the handset during its upcoming Unpacked event. However, this doesn't come to us through official channels, but instead, through a post on Weibo (via 9to5Google). As far as other details, according to the leaker, Samsung will announce its upcoming trifold phone at the upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event in July, but it won't actually be available that same day. Instead, it will have a delayed release, with the information stating that it could be made official sometime in October. For the most part, this could be an interesting strategy, considering that most people could be more interested in the trifold than the new Galaxy Z Fold 7. While we have seen a trifold phone launch, it has not been made available inside the US, which would make Samsung the sole company to make a trifold available in markets outside of Asia. With that said, this trifold phone could be quite expensive, as the technology is still in its infancy. While it's hard to speculate on just how much it will cost, but we have to imagine that it will cost more than the current foldables out, which could have the price balloon over $2,000. In addition to that, we've also heard rumors that Samsung is working on foldable phone that's an Ultra variant. Regardless of what gets announced, the event will be quite stacked when it comes to product announcements, with rumors indicating that the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 will make an appearance, along with new Galaxy Watch 8 wearables. For the most part, this could be the most exciting Samsung event in years. And just in case you're interested, you can currently score a free $50 credit ahead of the Galaxy Unpacked event by registering to purchase whatever foldables are announced. The good news is there's no commitment to buy, so if you don't really see anything interesting, you can just ignore the credit. So if you're even the least bit interested in what's to come, we recommend registering. Samsung Register and score a free $50 credit with the purchase of a Galaxy Z Fold 7 or Galaxy Z Flip 7.",

While it\u0026#39;s hard to speculate on just how much it will cost, but we have to imagine that it will cost more than the current foldables out, which could have the price balloon over $2,000.
