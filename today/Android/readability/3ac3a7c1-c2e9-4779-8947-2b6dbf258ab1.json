Comcast, that massive corporation that owns Universal Studios, DreamWorks, NBC, Sky, and a ridiculous number more, also owns Xfinity, the mobile carrier and internet provider. You don't need to worry about all the others, since Xfinity Internet is the focus for today. If it happens to be your ISP, then this might be good news for you. We're living in times where subscriptions and digital services are constantly having their prices hiked higher and higher, and to give you some peace of mind against that, Xfinity Internet has just introduced a five-year price guarantee. If you ask me, it seems to be pretty good value, but I'll let you decide for yourself. Let's talk about it. Xfinity Internet's New Five-Year Price Guarantee Is Here Until June Image: Comcast It's 2025. Who can live without the internet? The answer is very few of us. You don't need to be addicted before you realize how hard it is for modern lifestyles to adapt to a day completely off the network. One of the most important places to have internet is your home. Think about it, your smart TV, video game console, computer, smartphone, and other smart home devices reside there, and staying connected is important. If you have Xfinity Internet or you're considering switching over, then you're going to like what the brand has to offer you. For the first time ever, you're going to have the option for a five-year price guarantee, at as little as $55 every month. That means for the next five years, you won't have to worry about your pricing stepping up even a dollar. The best part is that this doesn't even require you to be on an annual contract. Keep paying monthly. Image: Xfinity The only problem is, if you want this deal, you're going to have to jump on it soon. This is a limited time offer and the promotion will end on June 23rd, so it is important to make sure that you move fast. Xfinity Will Give You More Perks Than Just a Locked Price The best part about this new promo from Comcast is that it isn't just limited to having your pricing locked for the next half of a decade. I mean, that's good enough on its own, but it isn't everything. Xfinity wants to make sure you take this deal, so it is adding quite a bit to sweeten the deal even further. For one, if you're a new customer, you're going to be getting Xfinity's latest Wi-Fi gateway, paired with unlimited data, so every single device in your home will be able to enjoy the perks of Xfinity Internet with zero compromises. With the gateway, you'll also be getting Xfinity Advanced Security to keep all connected devices safe from the threats of the dangerous online terrain. Image: Xfinity And hey, if you're searching for a new carrier to put your Android smartphone on, you'll be getting an Xfinity Mobile line with a free year of service. That's not something most people will turn down. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast.
