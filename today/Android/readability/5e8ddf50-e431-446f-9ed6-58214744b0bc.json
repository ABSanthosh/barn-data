These new sizes have been first rumored to arrive within a few weeks all the way back in September, so it's certainly taken Samsung a long time to get these to market - provided, of course, that the company had initially planned to launch them in September. Anyway, they're supposedly almost here now, so if the only reason you haven't yet bought a Galaxy Ring is that you needed a size 14 or 15, it's probably time to start saving up.
