  "text": "Networking Sign in to your XDA account While Amazon has never said exactly how many customers it has, a lot of people use Eero routers in their homes — and many people are still using the default, out-of-the-box settings. You could be missing out on speed or dealing with minor annoyances that a few quick tweaks could correct. All you need to do is take the time to customize your router's settings within the Eero app. And here's the best part: you don't need an extensive understanding of networking to do it. Working with your router and changing network settings can feel intimidating, but it doesn't have to be. These step-by-step instructions will help you get better speeds and a more stable connection and improve the security of your home network. 7 Enable client steering It will prioritize traffic Client steering will automatically connect a given device to the strongest (and usually closest) access point to a network. For example, if you have a mesh router with one transmitter in the living room and one in the bedroom, your phone will connect to the one in your bedroom at night and the other one during the day when you're closer to it. 1. Open the Eero app. 2. Tap Settings -\u003e Network settings. 3. Scroll down to the Wireless subheading, tap Client steering, and turn on the toggle. 6 Enable Smart Queue Management (SQM) Give bandwidth where it's needed If you live with someone else, turning on queue management can help optimize performance. Certain types of web traffic like online gaming , video calls, and voice calls, demand a minimum level of bandwidth, and enabling SQM will allow your Eero system to automatically prioritize traffic. 1. Open the Eero app. 2. Tap Settings -\u003e Network settings. 3. Scroll to the Network services subheading and tap SQM. 4. Tap the toggle to flip it On. Related 4 reasons you should upgrade your router before your internet plan If you want faster speeds and better performance, a new router might be all you need. 5 Disable local DNS caching Old configurations can slow things down Your router stores Domain Name System (DNS) records temporarily to improve its speeds, but many of the most common glitches — like never-ending load screens or login loops — can be avoided by disabling this setting. 1. Open the Eero app. 2. Tap Settings -\u003e Network settings. 3. Scroll down to the Network services subheading and tap Local DNS caching. 4. Make sure the toggle is turned Off. 4 Enable WPA3 Protect your home network WPA3, or Wi-Fi Protected Access 3, is a type of security certification that will make your network more secure. Although turning it on could cause connectivity issues for devices that aren't compatible, most devices released after 2018 should work without a problem. 1. Open the Eero app. 2. Tap Settings -\u003e Network settings. 3. Scroll down to the Wireless subheading and tap WPA3. 4. Turn the toggle to On. 3 Disable UPNP Safe connections only Your router has an option called UPnP or Universal Plug-n-Play. It allows your console and other devices to open a direct connection to other devices on the internet. While this can help in specific instances, such as playing against someone with a much less compatible NAT type, it can also open your system and network to numerous vulnerabilities. Most security experts recommend disabling this feature as soon as possible. 1. Open the Eero app. 2. Tap Settings -\u003e Network settings. 3. Scroll down to the Network services subheading and tap UPnP. 4. Make sure the toggle is turned Off. Related 2 Enable IPv6 IPv6 is the more secure choice IPv6 is an acronym for Internet Protocol Version 6. For the most part, you won't see improved speeds from this, but it will enable your system to take advantage of the latest connection technology. 1. Open the Eero app. 2. Tap Settings -\u003e Network settings. 3. Tap IPv6. 4. Flip the toggle On. 1 Enable the guest network And make the password easy to remember If you frequently have guests asking for your Wi-Fi password , creating a guest network can be an easy way to grant internet access while limiting their overall access to your network. 1. Open the Eero app. 2. Tap Settings -\u003e Guest network. 3. Tap the toggle On. 4. Tap the Wifi network name field and rename your guest network. 5. Tap the Wifi network password field and give it a secure, easy-to-remember password. Better Internet, better speeds For many people, the thought of mucking around in their network settings is enough to freeze them in place. Amazon limits the amount of damage you can do with the Eero app, although removing the primary device or deleting your network name will cause problems. If you have encountered problems with devices disconnecting, swapping networks, or just general poor performance, then try making a few of these changes. They won't take long and could result in a much better Internet experience. Amazon eero mesh WiFi router This Eero router covers up to 1,500 square feet on its own with AC1300 speeds. It can be paired with any other Eero brand router (and some Amazon Echo products) to form a reliable whole-home mesh Wi-Fi network.",
