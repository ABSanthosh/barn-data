  "text": "Google Photos and Dropbox are good cloud-based options for photo and file storage and management, but using an open-source management tool like DigiKam is a better choice. Not only is DigiKam totally free — unlike the upgrades you’ll undoubtedly need with proprietary options — but its open-source development means you’ve got more control, privacy, and security options, too. Available on many platforms with many customization options, DigiKam should be your new photo manager of choice. Related Free professional photo management You don’t have to pay for good quality DigiKam is a great open-source tool for photo management. It receives regular updates, with 8.5.0 released in November 2024, consisting of 64 language options for localization requirements. It has a native Apple Silicone package offering to increase who can use the free software. While there are tons of open-source photo management tools available, DigiKam makes the top of the list and shouldn’t pass you by using it. DigiKam is available cross-platform, from Mac, Windows, Linux, and more, meaning you can access it from anywhere. Open-source software gives you so much more control and privacy than tools like Google Photos. You can choose who can access your account and images, and it’s stored entirely locally, so there’s no cloud hacking as a risk to your images. DigiKam releases weekly pre-release snapshots which are compiled versions of the tool provided by the DigiKam team for testing purposes. The pre-release snapshots let you try the current implementation, which has yet to be released, allowing you to see how it works with your system before installing the full version. Great photo collections and tools For any photo collection, you’ll have post-processing, editing, assembling, and transforming options for your images. All photo collections are scanned within DigiKam, which populates databases with important information for your image files. This includes camera settings, geolocation, lens information, copyright credentials, image captions, and other metadata. You can easily organize your collections and search within them using DigiKam’s native search tools. DigiKam’s collections can be easily set up and organized. The search tools utilize the metadata options, allowing you to browse your collections easily. You can compare images to one another in the viewer, too. It also has face tagging and search options, so you don’t need to rely solely on words to search. DigiKam makes it easy to share or publish your photos online, saving time when sending photos to different platforms to share in more complex ways. Related 7 tips to efficiently organize your drive space Keeping your drive clean and neatly organized will help you find your files faster and improve the PC performance. RAW development and editing features Edit your photos natively Editing RAW format images is a difficult feature to find in many photo development software. You could pay for Adobe Lightroom to edit your RAW images or develop and process them in DigiKam for free. Not only are there RAW processing tools and features, but DigiKam also has a host of other editing tools for your photos. Simple tools like rotating, cropping, and adjusting colors and more intensive editing tools like adding filters and effects to your images are available. DigiKam is primarily focused on photo management, not photo editing, so it might not be your go-to option for editing with a comprehensive workflow. But for basic edits and batch processing, then DigiKam is a good option. Related Digikam Choose DigiKam for your open-source photo management With so many choices available for paying for photo management tools or using various open-source options, it can be hard to decide. DigiKam has excellent features and a helpful online community. It’s free to use on Mac, Windows, and Linux machines for easy local storage. Although its editing tools aren’t complex, it features RAW processing, which is handy to have for free, letting you process high-quality photos from all possible sources.",
