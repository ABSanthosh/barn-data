Don’t let its price fool you however, as the handset comes with a large 7,000 mAh battery capacity, something that’s rarely seen on a lot of smartphones. READ: The Honor Power is Official, and it Comes with a Massive Battery As such, the Oppo K13 features a design with flat sides and a notch-less screen with IP65 dust and water protection. In front is a 6.67-inch AMOLED display with a 1080×2400 resolution, a 120Hz refresh rate, and up to 1,200 nits of peak brightness. Inside, the phone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 chipset, paired with 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of internal storage. It runs Android 15 with Oppo’s software features and is set to receive two major Android updates. The 7,000 mAh battery inside also supports 80W fast charging. For photography, the Oppo K13 packs a dual rear camera system consisting of a 50MP main camera and a 2MP depth sensor, along with a 16MP front-facing camera. The phone joins the likes of the recently-announced Honor Power, which comes with a slightly-larger 8,000 mAh battery.",
