Spicetify, which is a command-line interface tool for the desktop Spotify client, has posted multiple images on its social media account that have mentions of this upcoming feature within the latest v1.2.66 update. â€” spicetify (@spicetifyapp) June 19, 2025 For starters, the most obvious giveaway is the presence of a new option within the Audio quality setting dropdown, which includes a Lossless setting that can provide up to 24-bit/44.1kHz audio in FLAC. The onboarding for the app also includes mentions of lossless audio for Premium subscribers. Aside from lossless, it seems Spotify also has some new audio features up its sleeve, which, when paired with a compatible pair of headphones, claims to offer \"cleaner, more natural sound\". Digging further into the code also revealed mentions of spatial audio without further elaboration. What's not visible in these screenshots is what technology is being used for spatial audio, as there is no mention of specific codecs such as Dolby Atmos. It's possible the aforementioned cleaner, natural sound feature could be using Spotify's proprietary spatial audio tech that only works with select headphones. Moreover, there is also no mention of high resolution audio, as sampling rates seem to top out at a decidedly CD-quality 44.1kHz. Spatial Audio is mentioned in the code, however, I don't think it's Dolby Atmos. I don't see any UI or feature regarding Spatial Audio either, just that it exists in code interacting with the player so, don't expect it anytime soon pic.twitter.com/EtwM7m1lbwâ€” spicetify (@spicetifyapp) June 19, 2025 Of course, this was all dug out with the help of the override product state feature in the Spicetify tool and none of it is accessible in the current app. Even with the tool, you can only see mentions of the new features and not actually use them. Spotify announced its lossless HiFi feature all the way back in early 2021. While the company didn't provide a date, it was clear that the feature was imminent and most likely coming at a higher pricing tier than regular Premium. Then, Apple decided to rain on Spotify's parade and launched its own lossless audio feature, complete with high resolution audio and Dolby Atmos, for no additional cost. This likely took the wind out of Spotify's sails as the company immediately dropped all talks of the HiFi feature and adopted radio silence. It seems it was completely caught off guard and since then has been trying to formulate a viable plan to finally launch the service. It's possible the company might still end up charging more for the HiFi plan but we have heard over the years that there will be additional content included to justify it and the company has been building quite the content library outside of just music. As for now, we still don't have an exact date, so this feature could either drop tomorrow, two months later, or never. Source",
