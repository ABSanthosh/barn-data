  "text": "If you’re after a modern fitness tracker with just enough features to keep it wallet-friendly, the Fitbit Inspire 3 might be an ideal choice for you. Fitbit’s (or should we say Google instead) rather-affordable fitness band is currently at its lowest price right now, and this deal on Amazon brings it down to around 80 bucks. That said, the Inspire 3 is more of a basic fitness tracker, which comes with a slimmer and lighter design, although it does offer longer battery endurance. It comes with all the features you’d expect from a fitness tracker including heart rate monitoring, SPO2 and sleep tracking, and more than 20 different exercise modes.
