General summary Android is getting a major upgrade with Gemini, an AI system deeply integrated into the operating system. Gemini understands natural language, can complete complex tasks, and even generate images. It's secure, with your data never leaving your phone for sensitive use cases. Gemini is available on hundreds of phone models from dozens of device makers and will continue to get better over time. Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental. Bullet points Android is reimagining your phone with Gemini, an AI assistant deeply integrated into the operating system. Speak naturally to Gemini, and it will understand your intent, follow your train of thought, and complete complex tasks. Gemini can generate images directly from the overlay and drag and drop them into apps like Gmail and Google Messages. Gemini Live offers a mobile conversational experience where you can chat with Gemini about anything. Gemini is the most widely available AI assistant, supported in 45 languages and available on hundreds of phone models. Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental. Explore other styles: We’re infusing AI into everything we do, across every layer of our full tech stack — from data center infrastructure to the operating system to devices. In order for AI to be truly helpful, it should naturally fit into our everyday lives, and the best place to experience that is on your Android device.With Gemini deeply integrated into Android, we're rebuilding the operating system with AI at the core, and redefining what phones can do. Read on to learn how we’re working with partners to bring the power of Gemini to billions of Android users while protecting people’s privacy.New ways to use Gemini on Android We’ve completely rebuilt the assistant experience with Gemini, so you can speak to it naturally the way you would with another person. It can understand your intent, follow your train of thought and complete complex tasks. By deeply integrating into the operating system, Gemini1 on Android is even more powerful.Starting today, you can bring up Gemini’s overlay on top of the app you’re using to ask questions about what’s on your screen. For example, you can find specific information about a YouTube video you’re watching. You can also generate images directly from the overlay and drag and drop them into apps like Gmail and Google Messages.In addition to these integrated experiences, we're also bringing other updates to Gemini, including Gemini Live. Gemini Live offers a mobile conversational experience that lets you chat with Gemini about whatever’s on your mind. Ask complex questions, explore new ideas or even brainstorm potential jobs well-suited for your skillset or degree. Gemini Live begins rolling out today in English to our Gemini Advanced subscribers on Android phones, and in the coming weeks will expand to more languages.2Secure with Google Video format not supported No matter the task, it’s critical that your personal information is protected and private. With your permission, Gemini can help you connect your relevant personal data with all the valuable knowledge that Google has organized and made accessible to provide just the right help you need. For example, Gemini can help create a daily workout routine based on your personal trainer’s email, or use your resume in Google Drive to write a work bio.3 Only Gemini can do all of this with a secure, all-in-one approach that doesn’t require hand-off to a third-party AI provider you may not know or trust.And because Android is the first mobile operating system with a large, on-device multimodal AI model — called Gemini Nano — your data never leaves your phone for some of the most sensitive use cases. With Gemini Nano on Pixel 9, you can use Call Notes to summarize audio from a phone call or Pixel Screenshots to save and organize your images.So whether your data is being processed in the cloud or on device, it lives within Google’s secure end-to-end architecture, keeping your information safe and private.Built for Android’s scaleGemini is the most widely available AI assistant — supported in 45 languages, in more than 200 countries and territories, and we’re continuing to add more.It’s available on hundreds of phone models from dozens of device makers, and has been tailored for the many form factors of Android — from phones to foldables. On Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold6, you can bring Gemini into a multi-window, split-screen experience for multitasking. And on the motorola razr+, you can bring up Gemini directly from the external display to quickly summarize your recent emails without ever having to open your phone. Beyond the latest flagship devices, Gemini is already supported on existing devices, which means your Android phone keeps getting better over time. Video format not supported Wherever you are and whatever you’re doing on your Android phone, Gemini is just a touch away. On supported Samsung devices, you can just swipe up from the corner of the screen to bring up Gemini. And on supported Pixel and other devices, just hold down the power button to activate Gemini.These updates and more AI-powered capabilities, like Circle to Search’s new share feature that allows you to circle a selection and instantly share with others, will be available in the next month on your supported Android devices. And you can do even more with the newest Pixel 9 series — check out our blog post to find out what’s new. Made by Google 2024 Here’s everything we announced across Gemini and Android — plus, how we’re bringing these new capabilities to our latest Pixel devices.
