  "text": "Nintendo has a long history with the Star Wars franchise. There have been many different games set within a galaxy far, far away across multiple Nintendo consoles, some of which went on to become iconic releases of their time. But while some classic Star Wars video games have gotten the remaster treatment and have been re-released on newer platforms, not all the popular games people want to see have made their way to current consoles. At the same time, a few newly released Star Wars have also been missing from the Nintendo ecosystem, despite finding big success on nearly every platform to date. Luckily for Star Wars fans, the Force is shifting things around and opening up the opportunity for more great Star Wars games to be where Nintendo fans are playing their games. The release of the Nintendo Switch 2 will allow Star Wars games that have eluded Nintendo for quite some time to finally get released on their platform, allowing more people to play them. We're going to see new games like Star Wars Outlaws ported over to the Switch 2, but even more games could be brought over to the console in the coming years. There is no conflict this time, and no reason why some of the biggest and most beloved Star Wars games can't be on the console at this point. Here are 5 classic and newer Star Wars games that I want to see on the Nintendo Switch 2 sooner rather than later. Related The golden age of Star Wars video games There was a time when Star Wars games were creative and exciting. For many Star Wars fans, it was a golden age of video game releases. 5 Star Wars Squadrons Regroup with the squad Source: Electronic Arts One recent Star Wars title that never made its way to the Nintendo Switch was EA's Star Wars Squadrons. The game takes a lot of inspiration from the classic X-Wing and TIE Fighter series of PC games, putting players in the cockpit of a starfighter. Instead of the arcade style of action that one would find in the Rogue Squadron games, Star Wars Squadrons is closer to simulating what it's like to pilot a starfighter. While there are still dogfights and tense moments within the game's story, which is set in the aftermath of the events of Return of the Jedi, the simulation-like approach feels more authentic to what it would be like to pilot something within the Star Wars universe. A game like this being on the Switch 2 could be interesting because of the console's portable mode. Similar to what was done with games like Star Fox Zero, Star Wars Squadrons could take advantage of things like motion controls, allowing players to shift their direction or look around their cockpit. While this isn't a necessity, it could be something unique for a port like this for the Nintendo Switch 2. At the same time, re-releasing the game on the console could give an opportunity to add more starships to control within the game, including something exclusive to make this version stand out. For some, this style of flying game might not be their cup of tea, but there's no reason not to have Star Wars Squadrons on the console when it has been available on every other one. 4 Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Remastering the lost story Source: LucasArts One of the most popular Star Wars games on the Nintendo 64 has yet to receive any kind of remaster or re-release on consoles. Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire is an important game to Star Wars fans, as it told a story set in-between the events of the original trilogy and was part of a major digital event back in the 90s. The overall story was told through the release of a novel, comic books, and the video game that all bore the same name, but many are most familiar with the N64 game. Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire was later ported to PC with additions like full cutscenes and voice acting, but the original game on Nintendo 64 is remembered very fondly. With many classic Star Wars games getting remastered and released on newer hardware, this is one game that has surprisingly been ignored. It would be great to see a definitive edition of Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire that blends together the content and features of both the PC and Nintendo 64 versions. This could be done in the same way as what was done by Nightdive Studios and the Turok: Dinosaur Hunter games, where the best aspects of gameplay and other features from both versions were merged together into one ultimate release. Fans want to revisit the adventures of Dash Rendar, the schemes of Prince Xizor, and the time where the galaxy was within the shadows of the Empire. 3 Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Cal Kestis on Nintendo consoles Both Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor from Respawn Entertainment have not appeared on Nintendo consoles. The games were very well-received by Star Wars fans, critically and commercially, for their interesting stories and Souls-like gameplay. While you can make the argument for both games to be brought over to the Nintendo Switch 2, it would make sense if EA brought over just Jedi Survivor to the new console. This is mainly due to a lot of the gameplay tweaks that were added in to the sequel, as well as the newer story that is more relevant. The same kind of thing happened with The Witcher 3 and the original Nintendo Switch, where only that game was ported over and not its two predecessors. But why is Star Wars Jedi: Survivor a must-play game that Nintendo fans have missed out on? Much of it comes down to the character of Cal Kestis and his place within the galaxy after the events of Order 66. While the Empire continues its rain after the fall of The Republic, a series of events will bring a surviving Jedi Knight together again with his old friends as things continue to change for everyone in the galaxy. Cal himself is a relatable hero who has a great supporting cast, which is complimented by the wide environments players get to explore in the game. If EA wants to bring more of their games to the Nintendo Switch 2, this should be one of the first ones they should consider. Related Nintendo Switch 2: What I wanted vs what we're getting The Nintendo Switch 2 is almost here. But is it less than what it really needed to be for everyone? 2 Star Wars Rogue Squadron Rogue Five standing by Source: LucasArts The one classic Star Wars game from Nintendo platforms that should have been remastered already is Star Wars Rogue Squadron. Originally released on the Nintendo 64, the game was an arcade flying shooter that let players pilot a number of starships and undertake missions during events set around the time of the original trilogy. While players controlled Luke Skywalker in their own ship, other members of Rogue Squadron would communicate as mission objectives opened up. Unlike the X-Wing series and Star Wars Squadrons, the action was much more streamlined and fast-paced. Flying classic starships like Y-wings and even the famous Millennium Falcon were great fun, as were taking down squads of enemy fighters and ground units on different planets. The game was so popular that it spawned two sequels on the Nintendo GameCube that also became very popular. It would be great to see a remastered collection with the whole trilogy on Nintendo Switch 2, especially now that GameCube games are beginning to appear on the Switch Online Expansion service. But the Rogue Squadron series deserves more than a quick port to the console, since it's one of the most beloved series of Star Wars games released on Nintendo consoles. But even if we have to settle with just the first game getting remastered, it would be a great thing to see that is long overdue. 1 EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2 Capturing a new command post With the resurgence of EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2 on all platforms, the only ones not getting in on the fun are Switch owners. EA's Star Wars Battlefront games never appeared on the original Nintendo Switch, mostly due to the console not being powerful enough to support them. However, the Nintendo Switch 2 is more powerful than its predecessor and able to support more resource-intensive and detailed video games. Now is the right time to bring the game over to Nintendo's console and allow players to experience some of the big battles that have been going on for years without them. Despite a very rocky launch and many changes, EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2 has become one of the most popular Star Wars games that is currently played online. The PC version has a large community that continually offers mods to the experience, while console players rage on in large-scale battles set on a variety of planets with multiple heroes and villains. Battlefront 2 is a Star Wars game that definitely climbed a steep hill to find the audience that would heavily support it, even if Electronic Arts stopped doing so a long time ago. However, it's worth bringing the game over to Nintendo Switch 2 and letting people jump into this experience that may not have done so, especially when part of the appeal could be bringing the game with them wherever they go. There are still plenty of command posts for players to capture, especially when none of them have been taken on Nintendo's newest console. The Force on the Switch 2 The release of the Nintendo Switch 2 opens up a lot of opportunities for more games to be brought over, especially when they weren't on the original Switch before. People are looking for more games to play on their new console, even if it means getting ones that were previously available on other platforms. While some games that haven't been remastered yet should eventually get the attention they deserve, there are plenty of new Star Wars games that can be ported to the Switch 2 and reach new players. It's just going to take companies finally realizing that people want to play these games on the latest Nintendo console. Related EA won't make Star Wars Battlefront 3 because it doesn't have to now Many players are calling for Star Wars Battlefront 3 to be developed now. But EA won't make it, and it doesn't need to do so now. Here's why!",

Squadrons\u003c/em\u003e. The game takes a lot of inspiration from the classic X-Wing and TIE Fighter series of PC games, putting players in the cockpit of a starfighter. Instead of the arcade style of action that one would find in the \u003cem\u003eRogue Squadron\u003c/em\u003e games, \u003cem\u003eStar Wars Squadrons\u003c/em\u003e is closer to simulating what it\u0026#39;s like to pilot a starfighter. While there are still dogfights and tense moments within the game\u0026#39;s story, which is set in the aftermath of the events of \u003cem\u003eReturn of the Jedi\u003c/em\u003e, the simulation-like approach feels more authentic to what it would be like to pilot something within the \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e universe.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eA game like this being on \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/switch-games-run-better-switch-2/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe Switch 2\u003c/a\u003e could be interesting because of the console\u0026#39;s portable mode. Similar to what was done with games like \u003cem\u003eStar Fox Zero\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eStar Wars Squadrons\u003c/em\u003e could take advantage of things like motion controls, allowing players to shift their direction or look around their cockpit. While this isn\u0026#39;t a necessity, it could be something unique for a port like this for the Nintendo Switch 2. At the same time, re-releasing the game on the console could give an opportunity to add more starships to control within the game, including something exclusive to make this version stand out. For some, this style of flying game might not be their cup of tea, but there\u0026#39;s no reason not to have \u003cem\u003eStar Wars Squadrons\u003c/em\u003e on the console when it has been available

\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e One of the most popular \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e games on the Nintendo 64 has yet to receive any kind of remaster or re-release on consoles. \u003cem\u003eStar Wars: Shadows of the Empire\u003c/em\u003e is an important game to \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e fans, as it told a story set in-between the events of the original trilogy and was part of a major digital event back in the 90s. The overall story was told through the release of a novel, comic books, and the video game that all bore the same name, but many are most familiar with the N64 game. \u003cem\u003eStar Wars: Shadows of the Empire\u003c/em\u003e was later \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/5-star-wars-pc-games-that-need-to-be-remastered-now/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eported to PC\u003c/a\u003e with additions like full cutscenes and voice acting, but the original game on Nintendo 64 is remembered very fondly.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eWith many classic \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e games getting remastered and released on newer hardware, this is one game that has surprisingly been ignored. It would be great to see a definitive edition of \u003cem\u003eStar Wars: Shadows of the Empire\u003c/em\u003e that blends together the content and features of both the PC and Nintendo 64 versions. This could be done in the same way as what was done by Nightdive Studios and the \u003cem\u003eTurok: Dinosaur Hunter\u003c/em\u003e games, where the best aspects of gameplay and other features from both versions were merged together into one ultimate release. Fans want to revisit the adventures of Dash Rendar, the schemes of Prince Xizor, and the time where the galaxy was within the shadows of the Empire.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"star-wars-jedi-survivor\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e3 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            \u003cem\u003eStar Wars Jedi: Survivor\u003c/em\u003e\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"cal-kestis-on-nintendo-consoles\"\u003e\n            Cal Kestis on Nintendo consoles\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\u003cp\u003eBoth \u003cem\u003eStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eStar Wars Jedi: Survivor\u003c/em\u003e from Respawn Entertainment have not appeared on Nintendo consoles. The games were very \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/the-golden-age-of-star-wars-video-games/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewell-received by Star Wars fans\u003c/a\u003e, critically and commercially, for their interesting stories and Souls-like gameplay. While you can make the argument for both games to be brought over to the Nintendo Switch 2, it would make sense if EA brought over just \u003cem\u003eJedi Survivor\u003c/em\u003e to the new console. This is mainly due to a lot of the gameplay tweaks that were added in to the sequel, as well as the newer story that is more relevant. The same kind of thing happened with \u003cem\u003eThe Witcher 3\u003c/em\u003e and the original Nintendo Switch, where only that game was ported over and not its two predecessors.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eBut why is \u003cem\u003eStar Wars Jedi: Survivor\u003c/em\u003e a must-play game that Nintendo fans have missed out on? Much of it comes down to the character of Cal Kestis and his place within the galaxy after the events of Order 66. While the Empire continues its rain after the fall of The Republic, a series of events will bring a surviving Jedi Knight together again with his old friends as things continue to change for everyone in the galaxy. Cal himself is a relatable hero who has a great supporting cast, which is complimented by the wide environments players get to explore in the game. If EA wants to bring more of their games to the Nintendo Switch 2, this should be one of the first ones they should consider.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n

The one classic \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e game from Nintendo platforms that should have been remastered already is \u003cem\u003eStar Wars Rogue Squadron\u003c/em\u003e. Originally released on the Nintendo 64, the game was an arcade flying shooter that let players pilot a number of starships and undertake missions during events set around the time of the original trilogy. While players controlled Luke Skywalker in their own ship, other members of Rogue Squadron would communicate as mission objectives opened up. Unlike the \u003cem\u003eX-Wing\u003c/em\u003e series and \u003cem\u003eStar Wars Squadrons\u003c/em\u003e, the action was much more streamlined and fast-paced. Flying classic starships like Y-wings and even the famous Millennium Falcon were great fun, as were taking down squads of enemy fighters and ground units on different planets.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe game was so popular that it spawned two sequels on the Nintendo GameCube that also became very popular. It would be great to see a remastered collection with the whole trilogy \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/nintendo-switch-games-need-free-switch-2-upgrade/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon Nintendo Switch 2\u003c/a\u003e, especially now that GameCube games are beginning to appear on the Switch Online Expansion service. But the Rogue Squadron series deserves more than a quick port to the console, since it\u0026#39;s one of the most beloved series of \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e games released on Nintendo consoles. But even if we have to settle with just the first game getting remastered, it would be a great thing to see that is long overdue.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"ea-39-s-star-wars-battlefront-2\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e1 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            \u003cem\u003eEA\u0026#39;s Star Wars Battlefront 2\u003c/em\u003e\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"capturing-a-new-command-post\"\u003e\n            Capturing a new command post\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\u003cp\u003eWith the resurgence of EA\u0026#39;s \u003cem\u003eStar Wars Battlefront 2\u003c/em\u003e on all platforms, the only ones not getting in on the fun are Switch owners.
