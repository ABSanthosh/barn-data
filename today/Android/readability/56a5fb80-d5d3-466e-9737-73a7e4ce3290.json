Itâ€™s down to $784.99 from $1,099.99, giving you a rare $315 discount on one of Samsungâ€™s sleekest flagships. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Review (SAVE $400!) âœ… Act fast. This deal ends July 11 and is exclusive to Prime members. The S25 Edge stands out for its design. At just 5.8mm thin and 163 grams, itâ€™s the lightest Galaxy S25 model available. It features a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, a powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor, and 12GB of RAM. Despite its slim frame, the phone handles gaming and multitasking with ease and stays cool during heavy use. On the back, you get a 200MP main camera and a 12MP ultrawide, both capable of sharp shots with Samsungâ€™s signature color tuning. Itâ€™s not a camera king like the Ultra, but for most users it nails the basics and still delivers excellent portraits and everyday photos. ðŸ›’ Reminder: At $784.99, this is the best price yet on the S25 Edge. Battery life is decent with a 3,900mAh battery, and charging is capped at 25W wired and 15W wireless. Itâ€™s not the fastest, but itâ€™s enough to get through a typical day if you arenâ€™t pushing it too hard. And with 7 years of Android and security updates, the S25 Edge is built to last. ðŸ’¡ Want the deal? Get Prime access now This Galaxy S25 Edge deal is exclusively for Amazon Prime members.
