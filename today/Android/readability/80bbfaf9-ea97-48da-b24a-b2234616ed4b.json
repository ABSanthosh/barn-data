According to UniverseIce, Samsung is considering a new strategy. The Z Fold and Z Flip models may receive One UI updates that align directly with Android versions. So, One UI 8 would launch with Android 16 on foldables. Meanwhile, the S-series phones could get a slightly delayed One UI 9.5 update, still based on the same Android version. This change wouldn’t leave the Galaxy S lineup behind. In fact, Samsung could give S-series phones more features. These would include updated UI designs, new AI tools, and other experience upgrades. Still, this move raises questions. People who buy Galaxy S flagships often expect to get software updates first. If Samsung shifts that benefit to foldables, some loyal users might feel sidelined. There’s also the issue of timing. If foldables get their update first, when will they receive the extra features in the S-range release? Will they wait for the next major version, or get those features later in the same cycle? It’s hard to believe Samsung would hold back features from its most expensive phones. Nothing is official yet. Samsung hasn’t confirmed any of this, and the company has started cracking down on leaks. But if the leak is accurate, the Samsung One UI update process might soon look very different. A graphic novelist wannabe. Amateur chef. Mechanical keyboard enthusiast. Writer of tech with over a decade of experience. Juggles between using a Mac and Windows PC, switches between iOS and Android, believes in the best of both worlds.
