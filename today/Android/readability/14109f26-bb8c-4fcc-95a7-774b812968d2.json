Android flagships have only gotten more competitive in the last few years, and Samsung certainly has its work cut out if it wants to stay ahead of the game. With that in mind, here are a few things that we would like to see on the Samsung Galaxy S25 – let’s get started! READ: Samsung is going all-in on foldables this year Faster Charging Speeds Perhaps one of the biggest drawbacks of owning a Samsung Galaxy S phone is the limited charging speed. Given its flagship status, the Galaxy S24’s 25W charging is simply unacceptable these days, even more when you consider that rival brands such as OnePlus and Xiaomi for example offer much faster wired and wireless charging. If there’s ever one improvement we’re hoping to see on the Galaxy S25, it’s on this front. Granted, the S24 Plus comes with faster 45W charging, but hey, it’s Samsung – the BIGGEST selling Android brand – surely the folks at South Korea can pack a better charging experience here? More RAM Options The Galaxy S24’s base version launched with 8GB of RAM, a memory configuration found on much more affordable devices from rival brands like the Pixel 8a and 7a, both of which cost just above half the S24’s price. While the more expensive S24 variant came with 12GB of RAM, it would be nice to see the base model Galaxy S25 come with a 16GB RAM version. We can probably expect Samsung to release the base model with 12GB of memory, although again we’re crossing our fingers for a 16GB RAM variant which should be more than enough for top-tier performance, especially when paired with the Snapdragon 8 Elite. READ: HONOR’s New Porsche-styled Magic7 RSR Adds a bit of “Oomph” to its Design Camera Performance As for cameras, we’re not asking for a total overhaul – there’s no doubt that Samsung’s flagship smartphone cameras are among the best performers on the market, being able to keep up with the likes of the Pixel series and Apple’s iPhone flagships. However, one additional improvement that we’d like to see is increased shutter speed for moving objects – Samsung says that it’s reduced the S24’s shutter lag, although some users are still seeing less-than-stellar results on their smartphones, which leads us to think that there’s still room for considerable improvement. Improved Biometrics Options As far as facial recognition biometrics are concerned, Apple’s Face ID technology is one of the more impressive features on the market, rivalled only by a handful of Android devices – this includes the Pixel 8 and 9 series phones, which feature “Class 3 Face Unlock.” This essentially means that Pixel phones can use facial recognition to authorize secure transactions without the need for fingerprint recognition. While the S24 series phones have relatively speedy face unlock capabilities, they lack Class 3 certification – this is another much-welcome feature should Samsung introduce it with the Galaxy S25. Call this wishful thinking if you must, but at this point in time there’s a lot of hype riding on the Galaxy S25. After the somewhat minute differences between the Galaxy S23 and S24 series, we’re hoping that Samsung blows the competition out of the water once its new flagship phones launch, and to see newer hardware features (such as the ones listed here) would no doubt be much appreciated.
