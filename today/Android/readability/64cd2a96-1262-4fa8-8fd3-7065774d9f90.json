This tiny computer can do so much more than just basic tasks. You can set up a home media center, build robots, or even create your own software. Its adaptability makes it a superb choice for any project you have in mind. It’s also affordable and small, so you can build anything you want without breaking the bank or spending too much time on setup. Your changes have been saved Raspberry Pi 5 Your changes have been saved Raspberry Pi 4 However, the Raspberry Pi is not just good for everyday use. It’s also an excellent tool for keeping your network safe. It can filter out malicious traffic and keep your data safe from hackers. Using the Raspberry Pi as a network firewall or intrusion detection system, you can protect your network and ensure everything runs smoothly. Whether you have a small home network or a big business, the Raspberry Pi is a great way to keep your data safe and sound. Related 3 reasons you don't need to build your own firewall with pfSense or OPNsense It goes against my very being, but here are some reasons you don't need to build your own router. 8 Small form factor for effortless placement Fitting into limited spaces with no compromise The Raspberry Pi is known for its tiny size. It’s about the size of a deck of playing cards, or even smaller if you opt for the Compute Module. This means that it can fit in places where a regular desktop computer or server can’t. It’s excellent for small home offices or tech closets already cluttered with cables and routers. The Pi’s enclosure keeps it hidden, so you don’t have to worry about clutter. But it also has good network filtering capabilities, so you can keep your network safe. You can put it next to or behind your router, and it’s easy to wire up. The Raspberry Pi is also very portable. If you need to move your filtering setup to a different place or if you need to change your home or office layout, the Pi is easy to carry and move. This makes it a great choice for people who want to experiment with network filters or for professionals who need a quick setup. 7 Low cost with significant budgeting benefits Saving money while keeping vital features The Raspberry Pi is a budget-friendly option for both hobbyists and IT professionals. You can get entry-level models for a fraction of the cost of high-end firewalls or dedicated filtering appliances. This way, you can experiment without breaking the bank. Even though it’s cheap, the Pi can run powerful open-source tools like Pi-hole, Dnsmasq, and an Iptables firewall. These tools can block domains, change DNS routing, and do other cool stuff that some of the more expensive commercial solutions can’t. For the ultimate protection, OPNSense runs well on even the entry-level Raspberry Pi 4B or 5. So, you can stretch your budget and add more stuff to your network without spending a fortune. The Pi is also really long-lasting. If you decide to get a newer model in the future, you can use the old one for something else, like a VPN server or a secondary DNS node. This way, you’re not wasting money and always learning and experimenting with your network. 6 Low power usage keeps costs down Operating efficiently for 24/7 traffic filtering The Raspberry Pi is a power-saving miser compared to traditional servers or even many desktop PCs. It’s perfect for running non-stop, and you won’t even notice a dent in your electricity bill. If you’ve got multiple Pi units or need to keep filtering active all the time, this is your ticket. The Pi can be your reliable sidekick in any situation thanks to its incredible power efficiency. Whether you’re blocking ads for a busy family or monitoring network traffic in a small office, the Pi’s low power consumption means you won’t have to worry about high overhead costs or noisy cooling systems. Its quiet performance makes it perfect for shared spaces, creating a comfortable environment while keeping your network safe and sound. 5 Steady reliability for continuous performance Maintaining essential uptime in your network The Raspberry Pi may not look fancy, but it’s a reliable little computer. Once you set it up, it can run for a long time without rebooting. Just make sure you keep its software and firmware up to date. This is especially important for network filtering, as interruptions can compromise convenience and security. The Raspberry Pi’s simple design makes it less likely to break down. Unlike bigger computers with many moving parts, the Pi uses an SD or microSD card for storage. While you should still back up your data, the Pi’s few parts and stable operating system make it much less likely to crash. Whether you’re a home user or someone who manages a network, you can trust the Raspberry Pi to keep your network safe and running smoothly. You can use it to limit bandwidth, block bad websites, or control what people can see on your network. Just know that it’ll be there for you 24/7. 4 Easy setup for user-friendly deployment Installing robust filters with less complexity Setting up a Raspberry Pi is a breeze, even for those with only basic networking skills. You’ll need a microSD card, an operating system image, and basic commands. And in just a few minutes, you’ll be online. Tons of Pi-focused guides walk you through the whole process step-by-step. To make your network filters even easier to set up, tools like Pi-hole and OpenVPN have special scripts that greatly simplify installation and configuration. They take care of the tricky stuff, so you can focus on setting up your filter lists, DNS settings, or VPN parameters — no more complicated command-line stuff. The Pi’s ecosystem is intuitive, so you’ll pick it up quickly. If you run into any trouble, tons of forums, articles, and videos can help you out. No need to be a tech genius — just a curious mind and a willingness to follow instructions will do the trick. 3 Flexible customization for tailored configurations Adapting to unique security and filtering needs Unlike pre-packaged appliances that limit your options, the Raspberry Pi gives you complete freedom to customize your setup. It runs on a Linux-based operating system, so you’re not stuck with a single software package. For example, you can easily combine intrusion detection with web filtering by installing the right packages, setting them up, and getting the desired results. This flexibility goes beyond basic DNS blocking. You can easily mix and match Pi-hole with other tools like Suricata, Snort, or fail2ban to build a strong defense against spam, brute-force attacks, and other cyber threats. Even better, the Pi’s modular design lets you perform more advanced tasks, like setting up specific traffic routes or creating virtual local area networks (VLANs). One of the most incredible things about the Raspberry Pi is that you can choose exactly what features you need. This means you don’t have to deal with unnecessary bloat or slow performance. As your needs change, whether you add more users, tighten content restrictions, or manage your bandwidth better, the Pi’s modular design lets you grow and adapt without having to rewrite everything from scratch. 2 Broad software support for varied requirements Accessing a wide range of open-source solutions The Raspberry Pi is a true chameleon when it comes to software compatibility. With a vast array of Linux distributions and specialized images designed for the Pi’s unique architecture, users have many choices to create the perfect filtering environment. Many open-source projects have been tailored specifically for the Pi’s hardware, making installing and optimizing performance a breeze. Whether you prefer a graphical user interface or complete command-line control, there’s a project out there that’s got you covered. This robust software support means you can keep up with the latest network filtering strategies as new threats emerge or your organization’s needs change. New filtering tools often lead to the discovery of Pi-friendly builds or easy installation guides, giving you the flexibility to stay ahead of the curve without being tied to proprietary hardware or software ecosystems. 1 A thriving community and widespread documentation Finding guidance and ongoing improvement together Source: Unplash One of the best reasons to pick a Raspberry Pi for network filtering is the fantastic community that supports it.

It’s about the size of a deck of playing cards, or even smaller if you opt for the Compute Module. This means that it can fit in places where a regular desktop computer or server can’t. It’s excellent for small home offices or tech closets already cluttered with cables and routers.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe Pi’s enclosure keeps it hidden, so you don’t have to worry about clutter. But it also has good network filtering capabilities, so you can keep your network safe. You can put it next to or behind your router, and it’s easy to wire up.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe Raspberry Pi is also very portable. If you need to move your filtering setup to a different place or if you need to change your home or office layout, the Pi is easy to carry and move. This makes it a great choice for people who want to experiment with network filters or for professionals who need a quick setup.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"low-cost-with-significant-budgeting-benefits\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e7 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Low cost with significant budgeting benefits\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"saving-money-while-keeping-vital-features\"\u003e\n            Saving money while keeping vital features\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                        \n    \n    \n    \u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inexpensive-sbcs.jpg\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\"\u003e\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n        \u003cpicture\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inexpensive-sbcs.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inexpensive-sbcs.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inexpensive-sbcs.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inexpensive-sbcs.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inexpensive-sbcs.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inexpensive-sbcs.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inexpensive-sbcs.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inexpensive-sbcs.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n                \u003cimg width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"hand extended with a bag of money hovering above\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inexpensive-sbcs.jpg\" src=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inexpensive-sbcs.jpg\"/\u003e\n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n                                    \n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Raspberry Pi is a budget-friendly option for both hobbyists and IT professionals.
