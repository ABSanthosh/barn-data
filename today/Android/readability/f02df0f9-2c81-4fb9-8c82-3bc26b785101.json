The foldable market is exciting. It reminds me of the good old days of smartphones, when each year brought drastic new improvements, whether it was a bigger screen, a higher-resolution camera, or a bigger battery. Unlike modern smartphones, foldables are actually allowed to tout how thin they are. The thinnest foldable in the world is coming in ten days. The Oppo Find N5 should redefine what foldable smartphones should look like, and it is particularly exciting because it will likely serve as a template for the OnePlus Open 2 that will follow it. Oh, and it is launching globally on February 20th. Oppo's New Foldable Is Gearing Up for Launch Image: Abhishek Yadav I'm not one of the people who'd line up for a new foldable. The devices still have a few weak points that I'm not quite comfortable with. However, I do enjoy watching as that market segment develops because I'm still a tech lover at any hour of the day. The Oppo Find N5 is the foldable of the moment, thanks to record-breaking thinness and its tight relationship to the OnePlus Open 2, and the device isn't even out yet. It's going to be out soon, though. Oppo has just announced that its upcoming Find N5 smartphone will be launching on February 20th. I'd have expected it to be a launch limited to China, but it's quite nice that it will be finding its way to global markets as well (though North America will likely be kept safe for the OnePlus Open 2's release). A Leaked Image of the Oppo Find N5's About Screen Confirms Some Specs Foldables are expected to be thin, but at their price points, they're also expected to pack in flagship specs. I didn't have any doubt that the Find N5 would be able to do both of those, but a screenshot from the device's software confirms that there's nothing to worry about. We know that the Oppo Find N5 will have a 512GB storage option (though almost certainly not the only one), as well as 16GB of RAM. It will also come with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite, which is great, considering it is established as a powerhouse chip. That should do a good job powering the tasks that you enjoy on the 8.12-inch inner display (with an almost invisible crease!) The battery will be a 5,600mAh cell, which is even more impressive considering its slim build—that's the magic of silicon-carbon batteries. You'll get 80W fast wired charging with 50W wireless charging. All of that confirms a killer foldable in the works. Samsung better have something good set for its next iteration. Several Images of the Oppo Find N5 Have Leaked One of the most exciting things about a new device is seeing what it is going to look like. Numerous images of the Oppo Find N5 have leaked, courtesy of Abhishek Yadav, and it is nice to get an early look at renders and hands-on images of the upcoming smartphone. Personally, I'm a big fan of the new design, and I think this foldable is certainly going to be one to consider for the rest of 2025. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
