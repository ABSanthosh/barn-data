  "description": "WhatsApp has begun testing new audio and video call options for its Android users. This revelation comes from WABetaInfo, who spotted these features in WhatsApp for Android's beta version 2.25.10.16. The first one is the mute button for an incoming voice call. It appears in the notification panel and allows users to answer the call while muting the microphone. We are not sure how exactly this will be useful. In noisy environments, perhaps?

Tell us in the comments below how you'd use this feature. The second feature is for incoming video calls. It allows you to turn off the camera before answering the video call. This is useful for users who need a few seconds to get ready before appearing in front of the camera or don't want to appear on the camera in the first place. It also adds a layer of privacy when receiving calls from unknown numbers since you won't immediately appear on the screen after answering the video call. The third feature is emoji reactions for video calls. This will allow participants in the video call to react with emojis in real-time. These features are available to some beta testers of WhatsApp for Android and will expand to more users in the coming weeks. Source",
