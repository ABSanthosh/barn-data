There's no real definitive answer as to which tools you need, and in most cases you can get by with a decent screwdriver. However, the more tools you have, the easier things will be and the better your PC will look when it is done. Building a PC is considered an art form by some. There are a lot of decisions, from picking the components to putting them all together and making sure everything matches up and looks nice. The tools you use to get the job done will make a big difference in the process and outcome. Some tools are used for testing, while others are directly used to build the PC, all of which are equally important in your quest to craft the best PC you can. Related 4 must-have tools to optimize your PC performance for gaming in 2025 Optimizing your PC for better gaming performance is quite easy - if you're using the right programs 6 PSU tester A cheap PSU tester can be a lifesaver and is something I swear by. Even just using one of the cheap $10 ones will let you know if your power supply is DOA or faulty before starting the PC build. Powering on a faulty PSU inside a newly built PC can also cause issues and fry components. You could lose your CPU or even GPU if a faulty power supply is connected and turned on. For only $10, it can save you a lot of hassle down the road. 5 Thermal paste While most CPUs and GPUs will come with thermal paste already applied, it is always helpful to have some extra as a back-up. You may want to change the pre-applied paste to a premium brand of your liking. It also comes in handy should you need to remove the CPU heatsink for any reason, leading to reapplication. Again, this is another cheap tool to keep in your toolkit which, in most cases, a small tube can be purchased for under $10. One tube can normally give you several applications as well, so when it comes time for preventative maintenance to ensure your PC doesn't overheat, you'll be all set. Related 4 Needle nose and cutting pliers A couple of pairs of pliers can really help leave you with a more aesthetically pleasing build when all is said and done. The needle nose pliers can be used to help pull zip ties and other cable management options tighter, while the cutting pliers can cut off the excess at the end. Needle nose pliers can also be used to hold screws if you can't quite fit your fingers into a tight space or pick up screws that you've dropped. While most needle nose pliers have cable cutting abilities, they can sometimes be in an odd position, so it is best to just get a pair of cutting pliers as well. 3 Cable ties While not a necessity, cable ties absolutely come in handy when building a PC. In fact, most cases these days have special spots designed for cable ties so you can tie all of your PC wires out of the way. Not only does this leave you with a better looking build, but it can help make sure airflow doesn't get restricted from wires being in the way, and will also reduce the amount of dust that builds up in the PC. A lot of times, manufacturers will include these with new components such as cases, PSUs, and motherboards. However, it is best not to chance it and get some for yourself before you start your build. Related 2 Anti-static work area While still a great safety precaution, it's not the issue it once was. Many years ago, if you built a PC without an anti-static wrist strap of sorts, everyone would lose their minds. These days, as long as you're not building your PC on a carpet or the couch, you should be fine. Using a wooden desk is more than suitable, but if you want that extra sense of protection, you can get ESD-safe desk mats or an anti-static wrist strap for added safety. A good extendable screwdriver can be an absolute lifesaver, especially if it has multiple bits included. Being able to extend the length will allow you to get into those hard-to-reach spots without having to shove your hand in there. The extra bits are going to ensure you have what you need for any screw you may come across inside the case. For instance, the bit you'll need for M.2 drives isn't going to be overly helpful for the PSU and case screws, so it is best to have an assortment on hand. Do I really need all of these to build my PC? No, you can get by with just the bare essentials if you choose. The only thing you will 100% need is a screwdriver. The rest of the items will be of great help, but aren't required to build a PC. Most people also don't just build one PC. A lot of the time they build a few, even if it is years down the line when it's time for an upgrade. Having these tools in your toolkit will come in handy and, should you ever face any issues or decide it is time for an upgrade, you will be more than prepared to complete the task with ease.",

While most needle nose pliers have cable cutting abilities, they can sometimes be in an odd position, so it is best to just get a pair of cutting pliers as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"cable-ties\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e3 \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Cable ties \u003c/span\u003e \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/pxl_20241206_131127310-mp.jpg\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/pxl_20241206_131127310-mp.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/pxl_20241206_131127310-mp.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/pxl_20241206_131127310-mp.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/pxl_20241206_131127310-mp.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/pxl_20241206_131127310-mp.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/pxl_20241206_131127310-mp.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/pxl_20241206_131127310-mp.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/pxl_20241206_131127310-mp.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003cimg width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"an image showing multiple black cable ties on a white background\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/pxl_20241206_131127310-mp.jpg\" src=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/pxl_20241206_131127310-mp.jpg\"/\u003e \u003c/picture\u003e \u003c/figure\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e While not a necessity, cable ties absolutely come in handy when building a PC. In fact, most cases these days have special spots designed for cable ties so you can tie all of your PC wires out of the way. Not only does this leave you with a better looking build, but it can help make sure airflow doesn\u0026#39;t get restricted from wires being in the way, and will also reduce the amount of dust that builds up in the PC. A lot of times, manufacturers will include these with new components such as cases, PSUs, and motherboards. However, it is best not to chance it and get some for yourself before you start your build.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv data-include-community-rating=\"false\" id=\"4d2a-4568-8469a2557f42\"

still a great safety precaution, it\u0026#39;s not the issue it once was. Many years ago, if you built a PC without an anti-static wrist strap of sorts, everyone would lose their minds. These days, as long as you\u0026#39;re not building your PC on a carpet or the couch, you should be fine. Using a wooden desk is more than suitable, but if you want that extra sense of protection, you can get ESD-safe desk mats or an anti-static wrist strap for added safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA good extendable screwdriver can be an absolute lifesaver, especially if it has multiple bits included. Being able to extend the length will allow you to get into those hard-to-reach spots without having to shove your hand in there. The extra bits are going to ensure you have what you need for any screw you may come across inside the case. For instance, the bit you\u0026#39;ll need for M.2 drives isn\u0026#39;t going to be overly helpful for the PSU and case screws, so it is best to have an assortment on hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"do-i-really-need-all-of-these-to-build-my-pc\"\u003e Do I really need all of these to build my PC? \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, you can get by with just the bare essentials if you choose. The only thing you will 100% need is a screwdriver. The rest of the items will be of great help, but aren\u0026#39;t required to build a PC. Most people also don\u0026#39;t just build one PC. A lot of the time they build a few, even if it is years down the line when it\u0026#39;s time for an upgrade. Having these tools in your toolkit will come in handy and, should you ever face any issues or decide it is time for an upgrade, you will be more than prepared to complete the task with ease. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
