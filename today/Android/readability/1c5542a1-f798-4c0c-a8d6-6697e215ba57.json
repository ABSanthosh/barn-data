  "text": "YouTube Sign in to your Android Police account Summary A new Live Caption update is rolling out to Pixel phones. Live Caption now adds the ability to have transparent backgrounds. This will allow users to have an option to see behind the generated captions. Google's Pixel series handsets have consistently topped our charts when it comes to the best Android phones that you can buy. And while there are a lot of good reasons to own a Pixel, the software features found on these devices are really a cut above what you can find from other brands. Related How to use Android Live Caption Keep your phone on silent and without missing a word Over time, accessibility features have grown, allowing more users to really enjoy and harness the power provided by smartphones. The Pixel's Live Caption feature is one that really elevates the experience, adding subtitles to all media that is played on the phone. And while it was good, it's now getting even better, giving users the ability to activate a small tweak that can make a world of difference. A small change that will make a huge difference The change was first spotted by 9to5Google, with users now having the ability to turn on background transparency in the Live Caption feature. Previously, users only had the choice of choosing two solid colored backgrounds, and while this was good, it did make it harder to see what was behind the captions when they were onscreen. Users can now experience this change by activating Live Caption, and then heading to the three-dot menu located in the lower right corner. In this section, there should be an option to activate Background transparency mode. Once activated, you should see the change applied to all captions that are on the screen. 9to5Google reports that Android System Intelligence needs to be on version 16 in order for this feature to show up. So just make sure that everything on your Pixel is updated before giving this feature a try. If you haven't tried the feature before, we have a complete Live Caption guide on how to use the feature on your Pixel phone.",
