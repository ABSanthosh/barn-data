The folks at WABetaInfo report that WhatsApp is testing multi-account support for iPhone, which should allow iPhone users to use WhatsApp on their phones with two different numbers at the same time. The feature should work on iPhones similarly to Android smartphones. The source says they discovered this development in version 25.2.10.70 of WhatsApp for iOS' beta app, but the feature is still unavailable for beta users, so they will have to wait for future updates on the beta channel to start using WhatsApp with two different numbers on iPhone at the same time. And once the development is complete, the multi-account support should roll out to all WhatsApp users on iOS worldwide, which could take a few months. Source",
