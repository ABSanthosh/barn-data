If you've been looking for a new smartwatch and want something a little different from the usual, we think the Mobvoi TicWatch Atlas is going to be just the thing. Not only does it run on Wear OS, but it also has a secondary lower power display that can extend its battery life by up to 45 days. While it has a retail price of $350, it can now be had for much less, with a discount that knocks over $100 off. This is the lowest price we've seen for this watch, so get it while you can. Related What's great about the Mobvoi TicWatch Atlas? Mobvoi may not be a brand that you're familiar with, but it has been around for some years, and has continuously offered better and better products with each new release. The TicWatch Atlas is one of the brand's latest wearables to hit the market, featuring just one design and size. It features a 1.43-inch OLED screen and, as mentioned before, there's also a secondary display that really allows the watch to push the limits of its large 628mAh battery. The watch is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1 processor that's paired with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. It's also quite durable, with the brand stating that the watch is Military Standard 810H certified. That means the watch will be able to handle less than optimal conditions and will be protected from dust, water, bumps, and drops. Since this watch runs Wear OS, you'll have access to some of the best apps available on a wearable. The TicWatch Atlas is also packed with a variety of sensors that can track your heart rate, sleep, stress, and physical activities. It also has a wealth of location tracking sensors as well, which is great if you want to log your run or just maintain your location during hikes. And just in case something happens while you're out, the watch does offer support for Fall Detection and Emergency SOS, ensuring you'll be able to contact people when you aren't able to directly make a call. Overall, you're getting quite a bit here and something pretty unique compared to other smartwatches on the market. The best part is that this watch is now on sale, coming in at just $245.

Not only does it run on Wear OS, but it also has a secondary lower power display that can extend its battery life by up to 45 days. While it has a retail price of $350, it can now be had for much less, with a discount that knocks over $100 off.

may not be a brand that you\u0026#39;re familiar with, but it has been around for some years, and has continuously offered better and better products with each new release. The TicWatch Atlas is one of the brand\u0026#39;s latest wearables to hit the market, featuring just one design and size. It features a 1.43-inch OLED screen and, as mentioned before, there\u0026#39;s also a secondary display that really allows the watch to push the limits of its large 628mAh battery.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe watch is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1 processor that\u0026#39;s paired with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. It\u0026#39;s also quite durable, with the brand stating that the watch is Military Standard 810H certified. That means the watch will be able to handle less than optimal conditions and will be protected from dust, water, bumps, and drops. Since this watch runs Wear OS, you\u0026#39;ll have access to some of the best apps available on a wearable. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe TicWatch Atlas is also packed with a variety of sensors that can track your heart rate, sleep, stress, and physical activities. It also has a wealth of location tracking sensors as well, which is great if you want to log your run or just maintain your location during hikes. And just in case something happens while you\u0026#39;re out, the watch does offer support for Fall Detection and Emergency SOS, ensuring you\u0026#39;ll be able to contact people when you aren\u0026#39;t able to directly make a call. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOverall, you\u0026#39;re getting quite a bit here and something pretty unique compared to other smartwatches on the market.
