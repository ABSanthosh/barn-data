Demand for the base 16 models remains lackluster, while shipments of the 16 Pro models are comparable to the iPhone 15 Pro orders from last year. The report revealed suppliers had been asked to continue producing both Pro models during China's National Day week-long holiday, meaning demand for the duo has generally met expectations for this year's phones. Still, Kuo pointed out that the current shipping times for the 16 Pro are shorter than those of the iPhone 15 Pro.

However, this remains a mostly American issue, as AI will not soon reach Europe or China. iPhone 16 • iPhone 16 Pro • iPhone 16 Pro Max • iPhone 16 PlusThe production estimate for iPhone 16 devices in Q4 2024 is 88-89 million units, which is slightly lower than last year's 90-91 million devices.
