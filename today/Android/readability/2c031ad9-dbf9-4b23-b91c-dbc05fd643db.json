Now it’s time to have a closer look at the other half of the 14 Pro series, namely the Realme 14 Pro. Both Pro and Pro+ are launching in Europe and the company featured both models prominently at its booth at the MWC. The regular Pro model is €100 cheaper than the Pro+ – the base 12/256GB models for each go for €430 and €530, respectively, with a €50 early bird discount. The MSRPs are actually €480 and €580. Despite their outward similarities, they are actually quite different. Realme 14 Pro (left) and Realme 14 Pro+ (right)For starters, the Realme 14 Pro has a dual-curved (left/right) instead of a quad-curved display. It’s a comparable 6.77” OLED panel (120Hz, 10-bit) but with a lower 1,080 x 2,392px resolution (388ppi, down from 1,272 x 2,800px and 450ppi). Also, the screen glass has no brand name. That said, the Pro is rated IP68/IP69, just like the Pro+, and is MIL-STD-810H compliant too. Dual-curved instead of quad-curved displayWhile we’re looking at the front, we will note that the punch hole holds a less capable selfie camera – a 16MP sensor combined with a fixed-focus 24mm lens, compared to a 32MP sensor with an autofocus 21mm lens on the Pro+. The video resolution is lower as well as it is capped at 1080p @ 30fps instead of 4K. We flip over to the back and the circular camera island looks just as busy as it is on the Pro+, but it has fewer inhabitants. The important difference is that there is no telephoto camera (the Pro+ has a 50MP 73mm periscope) and not even an ultra-wide module (vs. 8MP UW on the Pro+), just a 2MP depth sensor. Even the 50MP main camera has been downgraded to a smaller sensor (1/1.95” 0.8µm vs. 1/1.56” 1.0µm), but it does keep its Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) and the ability to record 4K @ 30fps video. 50MP main camera and triple LED flashWe have both phones on hand and the Realme 14 Pro is noticeably thinner and lighter – 7.6/7.8mm and 179/182g compared to 8.0/8.3mm and 194/196g on the Pro+ (note: the different colorways have different measurements). This will be less noticeable when you can’t do a direct comparison, but we appreciate the less bulky build. Even better, this doesn’t come at the cost of the battery – both have 6,000mAh Si/C power cells. That said, charging is slower at 45W compared to 80W, so 1-50% charge finishes 12 minutes slower (36 min vs. 24 min) than the Pro+. The Realme 14 Pro also uses a different chipset, a Dimensity 7300 Energy, instead of the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 found inside the Pro+. We haven’t had the opportunity to benchmark this variant of the 7300 yet, but it should be fairly close to its Snapdragon counterpart in CPU and GPU tests. The Realme 14 Pro is powered by the Dimensity 7300 EnergyThe particular version we have in our hands is the model with 12GB of RAM and 512GB storage. That’s the top of the line model, though, the base has 8GB of RAM and 128GB storage with 8/256GB and 12/256GB variants in between (note that some variants may not be available in all markets). Both 14 Pro models are available in Gray and the Unique Pearl Design, which is officially known simply as “White”. It really is unique and it really is pearl – the powdered seashell, which is mixed but not uniformly. This forms patterns of swirly lines that are unique to each phone. Realme 14 Pro in Gray and White (pearl) Realme also mixes in thermochromic pigments, which are white at room temperature but develop a vibrant blue hue once the thermometer dips below 16°C (61°F). Note that this effect will fade over time, lasting maybe about a year. Anyway, notice that while the Pro+ phone has a smooth and shiny frame, the frame on the Pro has a matte finish and flatter sides. Different finish on the frames for both phones The Realme 14 Pro and 14 Pro+ were originally unveiled in China, then launched in India and are now available in parts of Europe. Again, they start at €430 and €530, respectively, while the early bird promo lasts (after that they go up by €50). You will receive a 67W charger with the Pro and a 120W one with the Pro+, which is rare to see these days – especially in Europe. Realme 14 Pro These are the best offers from our affiliate partners.
