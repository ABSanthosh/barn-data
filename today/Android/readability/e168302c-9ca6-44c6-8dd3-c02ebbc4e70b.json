So if you've been wondering when to expect the Find X8 Ultra to become official, a new rumor gives us a rough time frame, and it's the first quarter of next year. That means Oppo's absolute flagship device will arrive between January and March. During the same period, Oppo is also said to unveil the Find N5 foldable, the successor to the Find N3 from 2023 (the \"4\" is apparently being skipped due to tetraphobia).

Interestingly, the source of today's rumor says Oppo is testing the Find N5 with the same camera setup as the Find X8 Ultra, but is likely to ditch it and continue with a tri-cam setup. This tells us that the Find X8 Ultra will unsurprisingly rock four cameras on the rear. But it's also disappointing to hear that the Find N5's camera game won't be on par. Then again, all foldables are at least a bit behind their slab-style counterparts in that regard, so this wouldn't be anything new. Source",
