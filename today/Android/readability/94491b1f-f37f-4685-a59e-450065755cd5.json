The Google Pixel 9 Pro is a rare small-ish Android with high-end cameras – a 1/1.31” 50MP main, 48MP 113mm periscope and 48MP 123° ultra-wide. Its 6.3” display is an LTPO panel with 1280p+ resolution and a 42MP ultra-wide (17mm) selfie camera. The battery is fairly large at 4,700mAh, but charging is slow – 27W wired and 21W wireless.

The Google Pixel 9 Pro is a rare small-ish Android with high-end cameras – a 1/1.31” 50MP main, 48MP 113mm periscope and 48MP 123° ultra-wide. Its 6.3” display is an LTPO panel with 1280p+ resolution and a 42MP ultra-wide (17mm) selfie camera. The battery is fairly large at 4,700mAh, but charging is slow – 27W wired and 21W wireless. The same hardware is available in a larger form-factor with the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and its 6.8” display (LTPO, 1344p+). The battery is larger too, 5,060mAh, with slightly faster charging at 37W/23W. Check out our Pixel 9 Pro vs. 9 Pro XL article for an in-depth comparison. Or, if we stick with the same size, the Google Pixel 9 is $200 cheaper, but you get the same Tensor G4 chipset (with less RAM, 12GB vs. 16GB), same main and ultra-wide cameras. There is no telephoto module, however, and the selfie camera only has a 10.5MP sensor. Also, the 6.3” display is not an LTPO panel and has a lower resolution of 1080p+. Here’s an in-depth look at how the Pixel 9 compares with the Pixel 9 Pro. If you’re more concerned with price than size, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is $100 less than the Pixel 9. The Exynos 2400e is faster than the Tensor G4 across the board, though it is saddled with less RAM – only 8GB. On the plus side, you do get a dedicated telephoto camera (an 8MP 75mm module, 3x). The S24 FE is larger with a 6.7” 1080p+ display, but the battery is essentially the same – 4,700mAh with 25W wired and 15W wireless charging. The Pixel achieved a slightly higher Active Use score, however (13:05h vs. 11:48h). Google has a cheaper series of phones too, like the Google Pixel 8a. The older Tensor G3 offers even less performance than the G4 and you only get 8GB of RAM with this one. On the plus side, it’s a good deal cheaper at $400 and it is small with a 6.1” 90Hz OLED display (1080p+). The 4,492mAh battery supports 18W wired and 7.5W wireless charging and scored 11:25h on our Active Use test. The Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet is on sale right now, specifically the 128GB variant without lockscreen ads. The 10.9” 2,000 x 1,200px display makes this a great streaming and light gaming tablet. There’s a microSD slot too, if you prefer local content. Also, the aluminum body makes this slate feel more premium than its price tag suggests. Amazon also has a choice of cheaper tablets – the Fire HD 10, Fire HD 8 and Fire 7 at $95, $85 and $45, respectively. These are fairly limited, but offer solid value-for-money given their price tags. Nintendo teased the Switch 2 earlier this week and some were disappointed that it isn’t a wacky new design. If you’re itching to try a new form of gaming, check out the Meta Quest 3S, the cheaper variant of the Quest 3. It uses the old display and optics (from the Quest 2), but features the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip like the pricier Quest 3. It’s a good middle ground if you’re not sure whether VR is right for you. We may get a commission from qualifying sales.",
