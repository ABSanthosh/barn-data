Here’s a list of common mistakes you can make when using a browser, and how to avoid them. Related 10 Not clearing cache and cookies regularly The browser will gradually slow down If you don’t clear your browser's cache and cookies regularly, that will slow the browser's performance. Its storage will eventually get bloated, and you might even have some potential privacy risks on your hands. Cached files and cookies can store sensitive data, track your activity, or cause websites to load outdated content. That’s another reason to clear the cache and cookies from your browser. Most browsers have an option to clear the cache and cookies under Settings -\u003e Privacy. Most people don’t do this because, in the basic mode, you also get logged out of all online accounts. However, in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and other popular browsers, you have an advanced mode where you can choose exactly what to delete. We have a dedicated guide on how to clear the browser cache and cookies for most navigators if you need step-by-step information. Another tip is to use private/incognito mode for sensitive browsing sessions. When you close that tab, it won’t store any data from the session, and this way, you are in the clear. 9 Ignoring browser updates Updates keep your browser secure Using an outdated browser version exposes you to security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues with modern websites. Updates often include critical security patches and performance improvements, so you should update the browser as often as possible. Nowadays, all browsers have automatic updates, but it doesn’t check them manually either. You will usually find that option in the Settings -\u003e About menu. Once you reach that menu, the update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Just remember to restart the browser after a new update. 8 Using weak or reused passwords This is a clear recipe for disaster Using the same password for different websites and services is one of the biggest mistakes you can make while using a browser. It should be obvious why you shouldn’t be doing this, although I used to do it myself. If one site is compromised, attackers can access other accounts with the same credentials. The next day, if not after a few minutes after the breach, you can get notifications from different websites that you’re attempting to change the password. That’s a bad sign, and you should go through all the passwords to change them and prevent a disaster. Chrome has a password manager; you should use the strong password suggestion whenever you sign up on a website. Also, it’s a great idea to use 2FA authentication, at least on the most important services, if possible. That way, even if the attacker has your credentials, they will also need your phone or biometrics to log in and change your password. 7 Installing too many extensions or add-ons Some extensions might even be dangerous Browser extensions might be useful, but not all of them are secure, and some of them might actually be harmful or invasive. First, when installing an extension, ensure it comes from a trusted developer. Look for some reviews online and check their credibility. The ones from Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons are usually safe, but even those can be poorly coded and hide vulnerabilities. Even if you install trusted extensions, don’t overdo it. Too many extensions might create conflicts or slow down your browser. I advise disabling the extensions or add-ons you’re not using at a particular moment. Also, check the extension list regularly and uninstall the ones you haven’t used in a while. 6 Clicking on suspicious links Phishing and malware are right around the corner Nowadays, all the most popular browsers have anti-phishing so-called protection. I am saying so-called because the protection is limited to warning you when you reach a potentially harmful website. However, the system is based on databases of known harmful websites. If a website was breached recently and it’s posting links of phishing or other harmful websites, the browser will not warn you about anything. The only solution here, besides common sense, is to hover over the links to preview the URL. Even if you reach a legitimate website, inspect it for any telltale signs of potential scams. Remember one golden rule: Nothing is really for free! Don’t rush to log onto a website before being sure it’s official. Let’s say you click on a link that takes you to an Amazon login page. It looks almost the same, but a letter inside the link is probably different, and you are actually on a phishing website. When you log into your account, you just send your credentials to the attacker. This is an example, but it can happen to any other service. The solution is simple. Instead of using that link, go to the official page or app. 5 Leaving multiple tabs open Every single tab consumes a chunk of the PC memory Keeping dozens of tabs open simultaneously consumes system resources, slows down your browser, and makes navigation cluttered. I always have around 20 tabs open in my main browser. That’s because I regularly use a lot of web tools for work. However, I should actually have 50, but I keep them organized into spaces and bookmarks and I only open them when needed. Then, I close them down to avoid unnecessary memory usage. The main browsers disable the tabs you haven’t used in a certain time period, but if you click them by mistake, you revive them. The solution is to use tab management techniques to group or suspend inactive tabs. Also, bookmark important pages and close tabs you don’t need immediately. Ads are not only disruptive, but they also take up memory If you’re browsing without ad blockers or privacy-enhancing tools, you can be exposed to intrusive ads, trackers, and potential malware. But primarily, ads and trackers will slow down your browsing and invade your privacy. Most browsers have built-in tracking blockers, and they are usually turned on by default. However, you will need an extension, such as uBlock Origin or Adblock Plus to block ads. Opera GX has a built-in ad blocker that is pretty good. Some privacy-focused tools like Privacy Badger or Ghostery can also block trackers. On the other hand, you may also consider switching to a privacy-focused browser like Brave, Firefox Focus, or Libre Wolf. Now, this whole ad-blocking business also depends on what websites you’re visiting. Most legitimate and useful websites use ads responsibly and don’t cover their whole pages with invasive ads. That’s also a sensible sign to differentiate the helpful ones from the others. Remember that ads also help the website stay alive, so if you don’t need an ad blocker, don’t use it on your favorite websites. Related 3 Not checking website security HTTP websites are not secure I mentioned above about inspecting a URL before clicking on it. If the URL starts with an HTTP prefix instead of a HTTPS one, it’s unsafe to visit. An HTTP page may not encrypt your data, making it vulnerable to interception. It might be an old page that hasn’t been updated in years, but it may also be a harmful website that might intercept your information. I recommend avoiding HTTP websites and only landing on them if you are absolutely sure they are not harmful. So, just look for the padlock icon in the address bar and ensure the URL starts with \"https://\". 2 Ignoring browser permissions Why does this website demand camera permission? Most websites ask for cookie permissions, but others require location, camera, microphone, or notification permissions. If you rush and click Yes without reviewing these permissions, you may get into trouble. As you may imagine, granting excessive permissions can lead to privacy invasions, unwanted notifications, or even unauthorized access to your device. That’s why you have to review these permissions carefully and only grant them to trusted websites. If something looks odd, just deny permission and walk away to greener website pastures. It’s not worth the risk. If you’ve made a mistake, you can also review and manage permissions in your browser. Most browsers will have these in the Settings -\u003e Privacy \u0026 Security -\u003e Site Settings menu. 1 Not backing up bookmarks Exporting bookmarks may be the best thing to do You’ve organized your browser with bookmarks for every website you need, and everything is neat. But what if you accidentally delete them, or the browser or device crashes, and you lose them? If you’re using Chrome, and you’re logged into your Google account, those will be stored in your account. On the other hand, if you don’t want to log in or use a different browser that doesn't have that option, you might use the bookmarks instantly. The safe way to go is to export your bookmarks into an HTML file and keep it somewhere safe. Of course, you should do that regularly as you add more bookmarks. Remember, it’s better to be safe than sorry By avoiding these common browser mistakes, you can enhance your online security, improve your browsing experience, and protect your personal data. Whether it’s clearing your cache, managing extensions, or staying vigilant about website security, small changes can make a big difference in how you use your browser. Stay proactive, and enjoy a smoother, safer browsing experience!",

First, when installing an extension, ensure it comes from a trusted developer. Look for some reviews online and check their credibility.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe ones from Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons are usually safe, but even those can be poorly coded and hide vulnerabilities.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eEven if you install trusted extensions, don’t overdo it. Too many extensions might create conflicts or slow down your browser. I advise disabling the extensions or add-ons you’re not using at a particular moment.

I am saying \u003cem\u003eso-called\u003c/em\u003e because the protection is limited to warning you when you reach a potentially harmful website. However, the system is based on databases of known harmful websites. If a website was breached recently and it’s posting links of phishing or other harmful websites, the browser will not warn you about anything.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe only solution here, besides common sense, is to hover over the links to preview the URL.

Let’s say you click on a link that takes you to an Amazon login page. It looks almost the same, but a letter inside the link is probably different, and you are actually on a phishing website. When you log into your account, you just send your credentials to the attacker. This is an example, but it can happen to any other service. The solution is simple. Instead of using that link, go to the official page or app.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"leaving-multiple-tabs-open\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e5 \u003c/span\u003e\n

I always have around 20 tabs open in my main browser. That’s because I regularly use a lot of web tools for work.

But primarily, ads and trackers will slow down your browsing and invade your privacy.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eMost browsers have built-in tracking blockers, and they are usually turned on by default.

Most legitimate and useful websites use ads responsibly and don’t cover their whole pages with invasive ads. That’s also a sensible sign to differentiate the helpful ones from the others.

But what if you accidentally delete them, or the browser or device crashes, and you lose them? If you’re using Chrome, and you’re logged into your Google account, those will be stored in your account.
