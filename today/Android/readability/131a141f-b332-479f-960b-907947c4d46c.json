Smart rings have existed for quite some time at this point, but despite that, there wasn't a single household name involved in that market segment—despite a lot of them being more than willing to jump into another form of wearables: smartwatches. However, that all changed when Samsung released the Galaxy Ring back in July. It hasn't been that long since then, so I can't say whether it has been the big hit that the company hoped for, but it doesn't seem discouraged. It seems Samsung is planning to tease the Galaxy Ring 2 at Samsung Unpacked next month. Samsung Could Commit To The Galaxy Ring 2 At Unpacked In Less Than A Month Image: Samsung Samsung Unpacked is happening on January 22nd and will be our first opportunity to see what Samsung has cooked up for its S25 series, including the new S25 Slim that's expected to join the foray. However, Samsung will likely be teasing other projects, as it did at Unpacked at the start of 2024. Not only might we see Project Moohan, its Android XR headset, but according to DigiTimes, the Galaxy Ring 2 will be teased. This shouldn't be mistaken with Samsung planning to launch the Galaxy Ring 2 in January, as that would have given its pioneering smart ring only half a year to ply its trade. Instead, just like early this year, it will just be a teaser to confirm its existence, not to detail its specs or anything. However, in January, Samsung is expected to announce two new sizes for its existing Galaxy Ring: size 14 and size 15. That comes according to Max Jambor on X. The Galaxy Ring 2 Is Expected To Bring Several Substantial Upgrades Image: Samsung Even without Samsung deciding to let us in on any aspects of the Galaxy Ring 2's spec sheet, there have been a lot of whispers that give us a good idea of what could potentially be coming in the form of upgrades. First off, the smart ring is expected to get thinner than it currently is, which would be nice for those who want it to have as much of a low profile as an actual ring. Even despite that, the battery life is expected to get better, though bigger sizes will be able to accommodate bigger batteries, so that could make a pretty noticeable difference. Of course, you can't forget about the magic of AI. Samsung is expected to improve the AI that the ring uses for a lot of its insights as well as upgrading the sensors, which in theory, should make for more accurate health tracking. Has Samsung Made The Wave That It Expects With The Galaxy Ring? Image: Samsung It's early, but as the first big name in the smart ring segment, I expected a lot of other manufacturers to jump at the chance to follow suit. However, six months in, there hasn't been buzz from Xiaomi, Apple, OnePlus, or any of the usual culprits regarding a smart ring of their own. I also don't know a single person who owns a Galaxy Ring, which makes me wonder: did the Galaxy Ring really hit the way Samsung wanted it to? Samsung initially ordered 400,000 units, but initial sales led them to produce 600,000 more. Based on the numbers alone, that's a good reception. The Galaxy Ring 2 will serve as a really good chance to see whether that was a fluke or not. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
