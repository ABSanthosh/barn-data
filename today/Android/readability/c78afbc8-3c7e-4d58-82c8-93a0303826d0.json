  "text": "For many gamers, their gaming PC is perhaps one of their most prized possessions. They spend an enormous amount of time in the pre-build phase, lovingly build their PC themselves, and freak out at the slightest frame drop or temperature increase. Another thing that PC gamers daydream about is upgrading their rigs to the latest and greatest hardware on the market. It won't come as a surprise to anyone that gamers are not too keen on frequent PC upgrades anymore. You are probably one of the people who feel PC gaming has become too expensive, unexciting, or even unsustainable. Alternative gaming platforms are no longer just a second thought as more and more gamers are spending less time on their PC due to systemic issues plaguing the PC hardware and gaming industries. Related How long should you wait between PC upgrades? Let's (try to) answer the age-old question: how many years should you wait before upgrading your gaming PC? 5 Gen-on-gen improvements aren't what they used to be Complacency has claimed PC hardware manufacturers Most users upgrade with the intention of jumping to a new performance tier by paying roughly the same amount they paid for their existing hardware a few years ago. Gen-on-gen improvements on several budget and mid-range graphics cards and even CPUs, of late, have been non-existent, with new components sometimes lagging behind old ones. With truly generational uplifts restricted to premium components, it's a tough time to be a mainstream PC gamer. If you compare the performance of Nvidia's 60-series GPUs, such as the RTX 3060 and RTX 4060, you'll only see a 15% increase on the newer card. The RTX 4060 Ti is worse, performing barely faster than the previous gen RTX 3060 Ti, suffering due to the reduced 128-bit memory bus and low 8GB VRAM. It's worth focusing on these affordable GPUs since they represent most of the consumer GPUs in the wild. Mid-range 70-series or premium 80-series cards might deliver substantial gen-on-gen gains, but these benefits rarely trickle down to the lower-tier offerings. This trend can also be seen in the latest CPUs from both AMD and Intel, as the Ryzen 9000 series was barely faster than the Ryzen 7000 in gaming, and Intel's Arrow Lake was actually slower than the 14th Gen Intel Core series. Thanks to such terrible products, gamers are increasingly getting less for their money, forcing them to retain their older hardware for longer than they would like to. Top-notch gaming GPUs and CPUs are available. Yes, but how many gamers are willing to shell out the premium for even the RTX 4070 Ti Super or the Ryzen 7 9800X3D? Related Light your money on fire instead of buying these 7 graphics cards If you're considering any of these GPUs, think again before you flush your money down the drain. 4 Prices have reached a new normal after the pandemic And they're anything but \"normal\" The GPU crisis that lasted from 2020 to mid-2022 might be connected to a variety of factors, but it gave rise to a new era in GPU pricing. Manufacturers readily embraced this new normal of significantly more expensive graphics cards compared to just a few years ago. Nvidia and AMD realized that a significant number of gamers were ready to pay anything for gaming GPUs, and we haven't seen prices return to digestible levels ever since. The dire situation has virtually eradicated the erstwhile budget GPU segment. Whereas, earlier, a gamer could grab a decently powerful card such as the GTX 1660 Super for only around $200, but they can only expect an entry-level GPU for that price today. Nvidia did not even launch a 50-series card this generation, and their most affordable offering, the RTX 4060, costs $300 — for an 8GB VRAM card that isn't much faster than its predecessor. Intel's new $250 Arc B580 for 1440p gaming is a step in the right direction, but we'll need to wait and watch what we get next year from Nvidia and AMD. Flagship GPUs offer top-of-the-line performance and a significant upgrade over the previous generation. Still, even their prices have been skyrocketing, with the RTX 4090 usually selling for much higher than its MSRP. The RTX 4080 was launched at $1,200 and later fixed as the RTX 4080 Super for $1,000. Nvidia even \"unlaunched\" the RTX 4080 12GB due to its misleading name, bringing it back as the RTX 4070 Ti. Such practices further illustrate manufacturers' view of the new GPU market, where they try to get away with terribly priced products unless there is a major backlash. Related Beware! That high-end PC upgrade might cost you more than you ever imagined PC builders often don't anticipate the extra costs associated with upgrading to high-end PC hardware 3 Consoles are pretty powerful now Gamers are feeling let down by PCs Consoles might still be technically inferior to a powerful gaming PC, but the current-gen consoles represent one of the most significant leaps we have seen on the platform. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X currently offer an impressive combination of hardware specs and value for money. Even if you disregard the PS5 Pro's much-improved ray tracing and upscaling capabilities, many gamers feel that having the PS5 in addition to their gaming PC is worth it. Despite the somewhat limited game library on the PS5, gamers are willing to invest in the console to enjoy more convenience, plug-and-play gaming, and time away from their PC, which is often a dual-purpose gaming and work machine. The money that could have gone to a GPU or CPU upgrade is going toward a new console, and many gamers are content with enjoying the best of both worlds — some exclusive titles and the relative ease of use on their console with other story-based, multiplayer, and indie games on their PC. It's easy to see that many PC gamers are realizing that they can get much more out of a $500 console rather than investing it in upgrading their PC. Instead of constantly dealing with crashes, diagnosing performance issues, and worrying about CPU temperatures, gamers can carve out some of their time for a no-nonsense gaming session on their console. 5:21 Related 7 things a console does better than a gaming PC There are things to like about console and PC gaming, but the former has a lot going for it 2 Handheld gaming has grown considerably Taking your Steam library with you feels special Another trend contributing to delayed PC upgrades is the rise of handheld PC gaming. What started with the Steam Deck has now exploded into a gigantic market populated by devices like the Asus Rog Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, MSI Claw, Ayaneo Kun, and others. These PC gaming handhelds have been around for a while now, and their specs are genuinely impressive, considering you can experience many AAA PC games on compact 11-inch devices. Handheld consoles bring something new to the table and offer things that neither a gaming PC nor a PlayStation 5 can — serious gaming on the go. With carefully engineered specs, comfortable controls, and a decent battery life, handheld consoles can even prove better than gaming laptops, depending on the kind of user you are. Using a handheld console on planes or bus rides will be much more convenient than somehow managing your gaming laptop and mouse on a cramped seat. Again, gamers who enjoy the immersion and performance of their desktop PCs aren't trading it for a handheld console but rather adding it as a complementary device to fit into their lifestyle. This, however, means that they might not be as willing to put up with increasingly expensive PC upgrades as much as they used to, spending that money on a handheld console that they can enjoy as much at home as on their travels. Related 1 The PC gaming industry is also to blame PC games are pushing PC gamers away The state of PC hardware might be one thing, but the gaming industry isn't doing us any favors either. You would be lying if you said you don't feel that popular game franchises have become more money-minded than ever before, intent on squeezing every last dollar out of the community. Innovation and new IPs have mostly been replaced by sequels, remakes, and remasters. The games that do bring something new to the table launch unfinished and unoptimized, with studios hoping to get things to acceptable levels weeks or months down the line. You only need to look at titles like Hogwarts Legacy, The Last of Us Part 1, Starfield, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Redfall, and many others to realize that this has been happening time and again. Combine this with games like Concord that are forced to shut down before they can even register a presence and scams like The Day Before that knowingly oversell and under-deliver, and it isn't hard to see why the general sentiment around big-budget games has been less than exuberant. It's not all doom and gloom for PC gamers, as 2024 gave us excellent games like Black Myth: Wukong, Tekken 8, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, among others. However, for every exceptional title, ten disappointments manage to overshadow everything else. Related If you hadn't noticed, these 5 disturbing trends prove we're in the dark age of PC gaming We might be living in the dark age of PC gaming, and I don't have high hopes of things improving anytime soon Will 2025 make gaming PCs great again? I wouldn't bet on it, considering GPU prices don't seem to be going down anytime soon, and the PC gaming industry's problems surrounding crunch culture, lack of innovation, and appeasing shareholders, above all else, will not disappear overnight. A variety of factors have led to PC gamers not upgrading their PCs as much anymore, but that might be a good thing. Maybe this will put pressure on manufacturers to offer better value products with genuine generational improvements. What this could also do is allow a large section of PC gamers to experience gaming on consoles and handheld consoles in addition to their regular fare. Things aren't so bad in the other camps; you only need to venture out and give them a try.

Gen-on-gen improvements on several budget and mid-range graphics cards and even CPUs, of late, have been non-existent, with new components sometimes lagging behind old ones. With truly generational uplifts restricted to premium components, it\u0026#39;s a tough time to be a mainstream PC gamer.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf you compare the performance of Nvidia\u0026#39;s 60-series GPUs, such as the RTX 3060 and RTX 4060, you\u0026#39;ll only see a 15% increase on the newer card.

It\u0026#39;s worth focusing on these affordable GPUs since they represent most of the consumer GPUs in the wild. Mid-range 70-series or premium 80-series cards might deliver substantial gen-on-gen gains, but these benefits rarely trickle down to the lower-tier offerings.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThis trend can also be seen in the latest CPUs from both AMD and Intel, as the Ryzen 9000 series was barely faster than the Ryzen 7000 in gaming, and Intel\u0026#39;s Arrow Lake was actually slower than the 14th Gen Intel Core series. Thanks to such terrible products, gamers are increasingly getting less for their money, forcing them to retain their older hardware for longer than they would like to. Top-notch gaming GPUs and CPUs are available.

The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X currently offer an impressive combination of hardware specs and value for money. Even if you disregard the PS5 Pro\u0026#39;s much-improved ray tracing and upscaling capabilities, many gamers feel that having the PS5 in addition to their gaming PC is worth it.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eDespite the somewhat limited game library on the PS5, gamers are willing to invest in the console to enjoy more convenience, plug-and-play gaming, and time away from their PC, which is often a dual-purpose gaming and work machine.

These \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/best-pc-gaming-handhelds/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePC gaming handhelds\u003c/a\u003e have been around for a while now, and their specs are genuinely impressive, considering you can experience many AAA PC games on compact 11-inch devices.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eHandheld consoles bring something new to the table and offer things that neither a gaming PC nor a PlayStation 5 can — serious gaming on the go. With carefully engineered specs, comfortable controls, and a decent battery life, handheld consoles can even prove better than gaming laptops, depending on the kind of user you are.
