OnePlus 13It's been a long time coming, this, and at least this year's 6,000+ mAh cells did not come with any penalty in terms of phone thickness thanks to the new silicon tech used, and we assume the same will be true next year - or, at the worst, we'll see marginal increases in thickness that can easily be lived with because of the improvement in longevity. Unfortunately the source of this rumor hasn't detailed which devices from Redmi and OnePlus will go to 7,000 on the mAh scale, but we assume the Redmi K90 series and the OnePlus 14 are prime contenders. We'll let you know when we find out more. Source (in Chinese)",
