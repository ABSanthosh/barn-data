  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Google I/O 2025 to focus on AI, Android 16, web, and cloud. Android XR could see more of the spotlight as it is set to power next-gen products. The event will take place on May 20 and May 21, 2025. Google I/O is a pretty big deal if you're someone that's in the tech space. Even as someone that is just mildly interested, there's a lot of great information that's shared at the event, giving a preview of what's to come with all of Google's products and services. For the past couple of years, Google has really been focusing on enhancing its AI efforts, adding Gemini to as many products and services that will accept it. Related Of course, you can't blame Google. AI has been a hot topic for many companies, which makes it an absolute priority. And while we will certainly hear about AI at Google I/O 2025, the company is also set to shed light on the future of Android, the web, and the cloud. No doubt, the opening keynote will garner the most attention, but there's also quite a bit to unpack looking at the full schedule. Expect to see a lot of exciting things at I/O 2025 Perhaps one of the most anticipated segments for this year is going to have to do with Android 16. The brand is doing something unusual this year, releasing its Android update early, which is set to become a reality in just a few months' time. We've already had our hands on the developer preview, but Google will most likely share some more details of what's to come. While Android will be available on smartphones by Google and other brands, it will be interesting to see just how versatile it is, since it will be powering the next generation of tablets, wearables, TV, auto products, and perhaps most importantly, Android XR products that will arrive sometime in 2025. Android XR has been teased for quite some time, and even made its informal hardware debut back in May. But the real products for businesses and consumers have yet to arrive, although Google does share that it will be coming sometime this year. Android XR is expected to see a huge push going forward, as it will become the software that will power the next generation of headsets. In addition, it looks like Google will also share the next evolution of its design UI with Material 3 Expressive. Of course, these are just some of the topics that will be discussed during this year's I/O event. And if you want to check out more of the sessions, we recommend giving the full schedule a look so you can register for the things you want to learn about. And just in case you can't do a deep dive into all the things announced, be sure to come back, because we'll have some great content highlighting some of the best news of the day. With that said, Google I/O 2025 is set to take place on May 20 and May 21.",
