The news marks a potential resolution to Apple’s ongoing iPhone 16 and Watch 10 ban in Indonesia. Cupertino’s products were banned due to unmet investment commitments. As per Indonesian law, foreign companies must provide 40% local content to operate in the country as part of the Domestic Component Level (TKDN) certification. Companies can fulfill those requirements by either manufacturing products locally, developing software locally or setting up R\u0026D centers. Indonesia is Southeast Asia’s largest economy, and Apple has reportedly considered expanding its production of accessories and components locally. If the new investment figure is confirmed, Apple could be looking at a long-term manufacturing commitment in Indonesia.. Source",
