  "text": "Last year, Razer launched its very impressive (and pretty expensive) Wolverine V3 series controllers, which includes the V3 Pro and V3 Tournament Edition. Priced at $199.99, the controllers do pack a ton of much-appreciated features especially for the “hardcore” gaming crowd, although they were a bit limited in terms of looks. Previously only available in black, Razer has finally updated the controller’s design with a new white model, available for both the Pro and Tournament Edition. Don’t go expecting any changes to functionality though, as the white model comes with the same specs and features. This includes the standard controller layout which mimics the Xbox’s controller, and comes with functions such as user customizability, updated ergonomics, a set of mouse click back paddles, two claw grip bumpers, as well as Razer’s Pro HyperTriggers, and Hall Effect thumbsticks. In the case of the TE variant, there’s wired connectivity via USB-C should you opt for even less latency during your gaming sessions. Source: Razer",
