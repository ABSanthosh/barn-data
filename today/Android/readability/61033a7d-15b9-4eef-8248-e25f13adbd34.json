So, the phone is said to come with a 6.7-inch internal folding screen of the LTPO Super AMOLED 2X variety, with a 120 Hz refresh rate.

Today a new leak brings us the Flip7 FE's specs along with its projected pricing. So, the phone is said to come with a 6.7-inch internal folding screen of the LTPO Super AMOLED 2X variety, with a 120 Hz refresh rate. The cover display is identical to that of the Galaxy Z Flip6, measuring 3.4\" diagonally. The Flip7 FE is allegedly powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, paired with 12GB of RAM. Camera-wise we're getting a 50 MP main shooter and a 12 MP ultrawide, along with a 10 MP selfie snapper. All three cameras will support 4K60 recording. Keeping the lights on will be a 4,000 mAh battery with support for 25W wired and 15W wireless charging. The phone has an IP48 certification for dust and water resistance. The Flip7 FE will be sold for under €1,000. If all of these specs seem familiar, it's because they are identical to those of the Flip6 released last year. So, if this rumor is accurate, it feels like the Flip7 FE will just be a Flip6 under a different name, which is a baffling strategy on Samsung's part. We have to assume that the Flip6 itself will be discontinued, otherwise with all the offers available for it already it will obviously be the better buy compared to the Flip7 FE, unless you really, really need the extra year of software support that the \"new\" device will be getting.
