This is according to a post on the OnePlus Community page where the company revealed that the phone will not be launching this year. According to Product Manager Vale G, “At OnePlus, our core strength and passion lie in setting new benchmarks and challenging the status quo across all product categories. With that in mind, we’ve carefully considered the timing and our next steps in foldable devices, and we have made the decision not to release a foldable this year. While this may come as a surprise, we believe this is the right approach for us at this time.” As the post says, this announcement comes as a surprise. Many were looking forward to the OnePlus Open 2. Oppo recently teased its upcoming Find N5 smartphone. This is the phone that the OnePlus Open 2 is supposed to be based on. However, that will no longer be the case. OnePlus reassures its customers that they are not stepping away from the foldables category. However, the company does not mention when we can expect to see the phone. Instead, the post says that OnePlus is committed to “developing products that will redefine multiple categories”. Either way, if you were hoping to see the OnePlus Open 2 this year, you’re out of luck. A graphic novelist wannabe. Amateur chef. Mechanical keyboard enthusiast.
