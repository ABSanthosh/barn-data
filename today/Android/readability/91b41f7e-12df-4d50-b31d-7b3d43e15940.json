Depending on whether one gets the Expansion Pass or not, there is a large selection of retro games to play that people have loved over the years. While the Nintendo GameCube classics section recently started alongside the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, the company has plans to add more GameCube titles to the service for subscribers to have access to. But for Nintendo fans to really take advantage of the service, and for more people to join, Nintendo needs to add more multiplayer GameCube titles to the library of Switch Online classics. But out of all the Nintendo GameCube games to add to the collection, which ones should we see on there? The GameCube has many beloved multiplayer titles that have a heavy emphasis on cooperative and competitive multiplayer. It was a defining aspect of the Nintendo GameCube when it was at the height of its popularity. Here are three multiplayer Nintendo GameCube games that should be added to the Nintendo Switch Online classics. Related 5 rarest Nintendo GameCube games you may never own These GameCube games are so rare and expensive that you may never get to own them. Here's why they're so valuable! 3 Kirby Air Ride Prepping up the riders Source: Nintendo With the upcoming release of Kirby Air Riders for the Nintendo Switch 2, it would make total sense to have the original game available for everyone to play. Kirby Air Ride was a racing game for the Nintendo GameCube, released in 2003, and stars everyone's favorite pink puffball. The game is similar to the Mario Kart series in that it takes multiple characters from a given franchise and pits them against each other in a kart racer. However, here, Kirby and his friends drive vehicles inspired by various Kirby games. The game was the first GameCube title to have LAN multiplayer, allowing for multiple systems to link to one another for multiplayer races. While Kirby Air Ride is much less content-filled compared to other racing games for the GameCube, it's one of the few racing games to become popular that didn't feature characters from the Mario series. Upon release, the game received a mixed reception, but it still became popular among Nintendo fans who enjoy Kirby games. Now that a sequel is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2, it's the perfect time to reintroduce Kirby Air Ride to those who may have missed out on it during the GameCube days. 2 Mario Kart: Double Dash Double the fun up The Nintendo GameCube had plenty of racing games for people to enjoy. But the one that most people felt was the best of the bunch was Mario Kart: Double Dash in 2003. The game took the formula of the Mario Kart series and added a few extra layers to the gameplay to make everything feel new. Players could control two characters on a vehicle instead of just one, with each character taking a role during a race. While the main character drives the vehicle, the other one will use items on competitors. It was a fun twist on the series that people really enjoyed, making it one of the biggest games for the Nintendo GameCube at the time. Mario Kart: Double Dash has a variety of multiplayer modes that are fun. They were great to experience on the GameCube back in the day, and would still be a lot of fun to play now. Between the Grand Prix mode, Versus, and Battle modes, this seldom got boring when it came to multiplayer. Up to four players can race against one another via split-screen, or battle against each other on various tracks. Balloon Battle, Bob-omb Blast, and Shine Thief were the three game types for multiplayer battles, all of which had players vying to complete a goal before the others. Friendships are definitely tested whenever Mario Kart: Double Dash is being played, making it a perfect addition to have for the Switch Online service. 1 Super Smash Bros. Melee Biggest reason for having a GameCube The biggest multiplayer game in the GameCube's library is, without a doubt, Super Smash Bros. Melee. It's the most requested game to be added to the Switch Online classics, and arguably the biggest game to be released for the Nintendo GameCube. To this day, many Super Smash Bros. players swear that this is the best entry in the series to date, even with the incredible roster of characters from later entries. There's nothing more exciting or hype-inducing than having four players duke it out in a multiplayer battle royal of Super Smash Bros. Melee. It was the game that made nearly everyone buy a Nintendo GameCube back in the day, even if they weren't a big Nintendo fan to begin with. It was also the game that introduced players to a variety of new faces in Nintendo's pantheon of characters, with some becoming noticed for the first time in a big way, despite being in games that were released previously in Japan. This is the sequel that took Super Smash Bros. from being a casual series into the stratosphere of competitive multiplayer, despite the creator of the series stating that it's a party game for everyone. For some players, Super Smash Bros. Melee can be insanely competitive, with tournament matches often showcasing feats that seem nearly impossible to casual players. But while the Nintendo community has been very vocal about seeing a return of Melee in a big way, it feels like Nintendo has largely ignored it. Whether that's because the company wants a focus on their newer Super Smash Bros. titles or not, there's a very strong desire to see Super Smash Bros. Melee added to Switch Online. Hopefully, in the coming months, this will become a reality to the delight of many Smash players as more games are added to the service. More classics for Switch owners Although it's going to take time, the number of GameCube games available for the Nintendo Switch Online service will grow. Much like the classics for the Nintendo 64, Super Nintendo, and Sega Genesis sections, the GameCube classics will become a more prominent part of the subscription service. Nintendo Switch 2 owners who have joined Switch Online will expect to see more support for it, especially as they wait for more new releases on the console following its release. If Nintendo wants Switch Online to be a bigger point of discussion among players, they're going to need to add more games they want to play through the service. A big part of that will involve having multiplayer games that people love to play on the Nintendo GameCube. Adding the titles they have been clamoring for will definitely get a lot of attention.

everyone to play. \u003cem\u003eKirby Air Ride\u003c/em\u003e was a racing game for the Nintendo GameCube, released in 2003, and stars everyone\u0026#39;s favorite pink puffball. The game is similar to the \u003cem\u003eMario Kart\u003c/em\u003e series in that it takes multiple characters from a given franchise and pits them against each other in a kart racer. However, here, Kirby and his friends drive vehicles inspired by various \u003cem\u003eKirby\u003c/em\u003e games. The game was the first GameCube title to have LAN multiplayer, allowing for multiple systems to link to one another for multiplayer races.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eWhile \u003cem\u003eKirby Air Ride\u003c/em\u003e is much less content-filled compared to other racing games for the GameCube, it\u0026#39;s one of the few racing games to become popular that didn\u0026#39;t feature characters from the \u003cem\u003eMario\u003c/em\u003e series. Upon release, the game received a mixed reception, but it still became \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/gamecube-games-need-switch-online/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epopular among Nintendo fans\u003c/a\u003e who enjoy Kirby games. Now that a sequel is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2, it\u0026#39;s the perfect time to reintroduce \u003cem\u003eKirby Air Ride\u003c/em\u003e to those who may have missed out on it during the GameCube days.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"mario-kart-double-dash\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e2 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Mario Kart: Double Dash\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"double-the-fun-up\"\u003e\n            Double the fun up\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\u003cp\u003eThe Nintendo GameCube had plenty of racing games for people to enjoy. But the one that most people felt was the best of the bunch was \u003cem\u003eMario Kart: Double Dash\u003c/em\u003e in 2003. The game took the formula of \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/review-mario-kart-world/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe \u003cem\u003eMario Kart\u003c/em\u003e series\u003c/a\u003e and added a few extra layers to the gameplay to make everything feel new. Players could control two characters on a vehicle instead of just one, with each character taking a role during a race. While the main character drives the vehicle, the other one will use items on competitors. It was a fun twist on the series that people really enjoyed, making it one of the biggest games for the Nintendo GameCube at the time.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMario Kart: Double Dash\u003c/em\u003e has a variety of multiplayer modes that are fun. They were great to experience on the GameCube back in the day, and would still be a lot of fun to play now. Between the Grand Prix mode, Versus, and Battle modes, this seldom got boring when it came to multiplayer. Up to four players can race against one another via split-screen, or battle against each other on various tracks. Balloon Battle, Bob-omb Blast, and Shine Thief were the three game types for multiplayer battles, all of which had players vying to complete a goal before the others. Friendships are definitely tested whenever \u003cem\u003eMario Kart: Double Dash\u003c/em\u003e is being played, making it a perfect addition to have for the Switch Online service.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"super-smash-bros-melee\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e1 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Super Smash Bros.

Melee\u003c/em\u003e. It\u0026#39;s the most requested game to be added to the Switch Online classics, and arguably the biggest game to be released for the Nintendo GameCube. To this day, many \u003cem\u003eSuper Smash Bros.\u003c/em\u003e players swear that this is \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/ranking-every-super-smash-bros-game-released-by-nintendo/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe best entry in the series\u003c/a\u003e to date, even with the incredible roster of characters from later entries. There\u0026#39;s nothing more exciting or hype-inducing than having four players duke it out in a multiplayer battle royal of \u003cem\u003eSuper Smash Bros. Melee\u003c/em\u003e. It was the game that made nearly everyone buy a Nintendo GameCube back in the day, even if they weren\u0026#39;t a big Nintendo fan to begin with. It was also the game that introduced players to a variety of new faces in Nintendo\u0026#39;s pantheon of characters, with some becoming noticed for the first time in a big way, despite being in games that were released previously in Japan.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThis is the sequel that took \u003cem\u003eSuper Smash Bros.\u003c/em\u003e from being a casual series into the stratosphere of competitive multiplayer, despite the creator of the series stating that it\u0026#39;s a party game for everyone. For some players, \u003cem\u003eSuper Smash Bros. Melee\u003c/em\u003e can be insanely competitive, with tournament matches often showcasing feats that seem nearly impossible to casual players. But while the Nintendo community has been very vocal about seeing a return of \u003cem\u003eMelee\u003c/em\u003e in a big way, it feels like Nintendo has largely ignored it. Whether that\u0026#39;s because the company wants a focus on their newer \u003cem\u003eSuper Smash Bros. \u003c/em\u003etitles or not, there\u0026#39;s a very strong desire to see \u003cem\u003eSuper Smash Bros.

Nintendo Switch 2 owners who have joined Switch Online will expect to see more support for it, especially as they wait for more new releases on the console following its release. If Nintendo wants Switch Online to be a bigger point of discussion among players, they\u0026#39;re going to need to add more games they want to play through the service.
