  "text": "Google Pixel 9 Pro $849 $1099 Save $250 The Google Pixel 9 Pro is the best phone you can buy right now. Not only does it look good, but it also packs tons of power and features as well. Best of all, you're getting excellent software features you won't find anywhere else and updates for years to come. Get it now for $250 less. You really can't go wrong with the Pixel 9 Pro. Google really refined this phone to its limit, delivering an overall experience that can't be beat. Of course, the phone doesn't come cheap, with this particular model coming in with a retail price of $1,099. Now, there are plenty of great deals out there, but most of them come from wireless carriers that keep you locked into a contract for years. Related If you're not really about that, we think this discount from Amazon is going to be more to your liking, with the retailer knocking $250 off the 256GB model, bringing it down to just $849 for a limited time. The great part is that you don't have to commit to any contracts, you just get a discount on the phone, use it with your existing carrier, and you're good to go. What's great about the Pixel 9 Pro? Google's worked hard over the past few years to really make its Pixel devices better than the competition. The Pixel 9 Pro delivers on all points, featuring an excellent design, a fantastic display, great battery life, and software that continues to evolve with every update. Not to mention, you also get a bunch of AI tools that actually come in handy. As far as the hardware goes, the Pixel 9 Pro features a Google Tensor G4 SoC, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of internal storage. It also features a 6.3-inch LTPO OLED screen, a 4,700mAh battery, and wired and wireless charging. When it comes to the cameras, you get a triple setup on the rear that consists of a 50MP main shooter, 48MP ultrawide, and 48MP telephoto. There's also a 42MP front-facing camera as well. The phone can shoot great photos and videos, and the photo-editing software is also top-tier. When it comes to durability, the device has an IP68 rating, which means it's protected from dust and moisture. For the most part, it really does deliver a fantastic experience that's hard to hate. So if this sounds like the phone you've been looking for and want to save, get it now from Amazon while it's $250 off. This is for the 256GB model of the Pixel 9 Pro. You have color options as well, with Obsidian, Porcelain, and Hazel.",

$250 off the 256GB model, bringing it down to just $849 for a limited time. The great part is that you don\u0026#39;t have to commit to any contracts, you just get a discount on the phone, use it with your existing carrier, and you\u0026#39;re good to go.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"what-39-s-great-about-the-pixel-9-pro\"\u003e\n                        What\u0026#39;s great about the Pixel 9 Pro?\n               \u003c/h2\u003e    \n\n\u003cp\u003e Google\u0026#39;s worked hard over the past few years to really make its Pixel devices better than the competition. The Pixel 9 Pro delivers on all points, featuring an excellent design, a fantastic display, great battery life, and software that continues to evolve with every update. Not to mention, you also get a bunch of AI tools that actually come in handy.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAs far as the hardware goes, the Pixel 9 Pro features a Google Tensor G4 SoC, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of internal storage. It also features a 6.3-inch LTPO OLED screen, a 4,700mAh battery, and wired and wireless charging. When it comes to the cameras, you get a triple setup on the rear that consists of a 50MP main shooter, 48MP ultrawide, and 48MP telephoto.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s also a 42MP front-facing camera as well. The phone can shoot great photos and videos, and the photo-editing software is also top-tier. When it comes to durability, the device has an IP68 rating, which means it\u0026#39;s protected from dust and moisture. For the most part, it really does deliver a fantastic experience that\u0026#39;s hard to hate.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSo if this sounds like the phone you\u0026#39;ve been looking for and want to save, get it now from Amazon while it\u0026#39;s $250 off. This is for the 256GB model of the Pixel 9 Pro. You have color options as well, with Obsidian, Porcelain, and Hazel.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
