The patent relates to how the LTE modem in Pixel phones communicates with the cell towers. The patent, however, wasn't licensed under fair and reasonable conditions. As a result, the Tokyo court ruled that Pixel 7 phones should be removed from the shelves since Google refused to cooperate. The company refused to pay a reasonable royalty fee and also refused to provide data on the number of Pixel 7 phones sold in Japan. The Japanese market is very important for Google because it is the second-largest smartphone vendor in the country after Apple, surpassing the likes of Samsung and Xiaomi. Pantech is now filing another lawsuit against Google, targeting the more recent Pixel 8 and Pixel 9 series, so unless the two companies reach a compromise these two might face the same fate.
