According to a report from Android Authority, Google Photos could soon help users identify images that might have been generated by AI. According to the latest version of Google Photos, they have discovered new code that suggests that the app will display credits for the image. For example, if the image was made using Gemini, it will show “Made with Google AI” credit tag, or “AI-Generated with Google” if used with features like the Magic Editor. Basically it will help users identify images that have been generated or maybe edited using AI capabilities. This isn’t a new feature per se. Other companies like Instagram have actually introduced similar “Made with AI” labels to help users identify content that might have been generated by AI. This is important because sometimes AI generated images can look very real to an undiscerning eye. It can be used to create misinformation or spread fake news, so being able to identify potential AI generated or edited images will help.
