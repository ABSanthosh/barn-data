Projectors used to be such a burden back in the day. They had bulky designs, blurry visuals, and brought so much frustration on anyone trying to align them with a wall. It was enough to just make you want to skip movie night altogether. Thankfully, companies like TCL are pushing technological boundaries and refining such devices. The brand has revealed their first-ever mobile projector, the TCL Projector AI. It was officially launched on November 25, 2024, with so many features to love. It's compact, versatile, and ready to transform any wall into a true cinema experience. Big screen support, great sound, and modern design TCL’s Projector A1 comes with 360 ISO Lumens of brightness and Full HD 1080p resolution. The brightness is on the lower side for projectors, and it works fine in a dark, cozy room or at night. But in a space with even a little bit of light, the image can start to look washed out. Usually, such environments are better for projectors with higher brightness ratings around 1,000 or more ISO Lumens. Image: TCL On the bright side, the projector is auto-adjustable and capable of producing clear images on screens or walls as small as 45 inches or as big as 120 inches. TCL has over 40 years of experience making displays, so they’ve made sure the colors look real and the details stand out.  Our amazing ultra large TVs offer the best solution for fixed screen entertainment but we recognize the different needs of consumers, so TCL is dedicated to bringing that superior viewing experience in new ways. Projector A1 is the perfect extension to our lineup as it meets consumers in the places they want to watch, no matter where that is. It represents the convergence of TCL's innovative technology, combining reliable Wi-Fi and streaming entertainment with award-winning visual and audio capabilities. Chris Hamdorf, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing, TCL. Image: TCL Besides visuals, the Projector A1 delivers impressive sound with two 8W speakers and Dolby Audio processing to make sure you hear everything the way it was meant to sound. Plus, it can switch to being a high-quality Bluetooth speaker with a light show, setting the mood for any occasion. Portable design to take the cinema anywhere The Projector A1 has the Google TV operating system preinstalled, so the projector collects all your movies, shows, live TV, and streaming services into one place, and you don't have to search through different apps. It also gives you recommendations based on what you like to watch and lets you use Google’s search to find content across over 10,000 apps, 800+ free live TV channels, and thousands of free movies. You can also create personalized profiles, so each person using the projector gets their own experience. Image: TCL The Google Assistant makes it possible to use your voice in finding shows, playing music, and controlling smart home devices. If you're not sure what to watch, simply ask Assistant to search across all your apps for the show you want, or help control the lights and thermostats in your home. If you're a klutz, the VersaGrip handle will let you easily carry the projector without worrying about dropping it. You can even push it down to adjust the angle for the best view. The TCL Projector A1 is available for the manufacturer’s recommended price of $499.99. The actual price you’ll pay may be different depending on where you buy it. Retailers might offer discounts or promotions that lower the price, or increase it. Image: TCL Irene is an experienced writer with four years in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.
