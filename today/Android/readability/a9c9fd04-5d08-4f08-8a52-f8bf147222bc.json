Not to be outdone, Samsung is teasing something pretty big, and while the company wasn’t exactly clear about what it’s revealing, you can bet that it has something to do with the Galaxy S series. READ: Galaxy S25 could come with more advanced AI features for free Given that the Samsung Galaxy S25 phones are due to arrive early this year, there’s speculation that Samsung might give us more details about its upcoming handsets soon. Also expected are updates to its Galaxy AI software features, something that the company has been marketing pretty heavily lately. Samsung US will also start opening reservation offers for folks who pre-order the new Galaxy devices early, and buyers can reserve a $50 credit toward a new Galaxy device during the pre-order period in addition to a chance to win a $5,000 Samsung gift card. Buyers can also receive up to an additional $900 credit if you trade in an eligible device, and an additional $300 instant credit for a total of up to $1,250 in total savings for pre-orders. The promo runs until January 22. Samsung’s event will be livestreamed on the Samsung Newsroom, Samsung.com and Samsung YouTube channel beginning at 10:00 AM PT on January 22nd.
