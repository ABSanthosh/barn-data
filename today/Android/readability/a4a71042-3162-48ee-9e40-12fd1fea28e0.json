In recent months, T-Mobile has been embracing a number of unpopular changes that favor their business but don't put customers in the best spot. For one, the pricing for all of its plans is rumored to have taxes and fees added as a separate cost. On top of that, there was that whole mess with the T-Life app recording your device screen. The newest change that T-Mobile is reported to be introducing will make some people happy, but others might be opposed to it. As the last carrier with a default 24-month installment plan, it seems T-Mobile plans to join the rest with 36-month plans. While that means lower monthly payments, it also means being locked onto the carrier for longer. T-Mobile Reportedly Considering 36-Month Financing for Devices Image: T-Mobile In countries with solid credit systems in place, financing can make life considerably easier. You don't have to have $1,000 upfront to be able to buy a phone that you really have your eye on. Instead, you can finance and pay the value of the device little by little, until it is fully paid off. This is one of the perks that you can expect when you go for carriers with postpaid plans. T-Mobile offers such financing, known as Equipment Installment Plans (EIPs). The carrier offers these installments split over a 24-month period, making devices a lot more affordable. However, out of the big three carriers in the US, T-Mobile is the only one still offering a 24-month term. CarrierEquipment Installment Plan DurationT-Mobile24 monthsVerizon36 monthsAT\u0026T36 months Image: The Mobile Report If a report from The Mobile Report turns out to be true, though, T-Mobile could finally ditch its current structure and join the other carriers with a 36-month term on device payments. This seems to be the case not only because of an internal document The Mobile Report got its hands on, but also because, for a brief time, certain smartwatches on T-Mobile's website showed a 36-month payment term. There Are Pros and Cons to Longer Installment Plans Image: Talk Android Now, you might be thinking: why exactly is a longer installment plan a bad thing? The truth is, depending on who you are, it's not always a bad thing. Let's paint a picture. Imagine a device that costs $360 that is being financed at 0% interest: Under a 24-month plan, you'd pay $15 a month. That's affordable, right? However, a 36-month term would mean paying just $10 a month, which is a lot easier to swallow. While that's great, it's not all upside. Carriers are trying to keep you onboard their ship for as long as possible, and with a 36-month installment plan, you're basically committing to stay with that carrier for three years. That's a long time, and if their service starts to lose its value to you, it's a lot harder to jump off. If this change ends up taking effect, there's no point moving to another postpaid carrier, as T-Mobile is simply catching up with the others. There's no escaping 36-month EIPs, at least with the big three. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast.
