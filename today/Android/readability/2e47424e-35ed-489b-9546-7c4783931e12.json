Designed for use with smartphones, the Kishi V2 Pro packs all the controls you need for your mobile games and streaming services, so it’s able to work with platforms such as Xbox Cloud gaming. It features built-in haptics, 3.5mm audio support, analog triggers, and programmable buttons as well. It also works with a ton of differently-sized devices, and even comes with support for pass-through charging.
