  "text": "Audio Bose Ultra Open Earbuds $229 $299 Save $70 The Bose Ultra Open Earbuds are non-noise-cancelling earbuds that are designed to hook over the ears. Leaving both canals open, youâ€™ll be able to hear environmental sounds while still listening to music and podcasts, or taking phone calls. The Ultra Open buds should last for up to 7.5 hours on a full charge, and an extra 11.5 hours can be stored on the charging case. Bose makes some of the best earbuds and headphones available right now. But if you're looking for something a little different, a pair of open earbuds might just be the thing. Now, if you've never heard of or tried open earbuds, they work a bit differently from conventional earbuds, in that they sit outside your ear canal, allowing you to naturally hear what's happening around you. Related Bose Ultra Open Earbuds review: Niche appeal These 'open' buds are great, but not for every situation Of course, these types of earbuds aren't going to be for everyone, but if you need a pair of earbuds that allows you to be more aware of your surroundings, while still being able to enjoy your tunes, then open earbuds might be a good option. Now, Bose makes a pretty good pair with its Ultra Open earbuds, and you can now get a serious discount on them if you're quick, as they fall to one of their lowest prices yet. What makes the Bose Ultra Open earbuds great? When it comes to the top things that we loved about these earbuds from our review, it was that the Ultra Open earbuds were comfortable to wear, they still managed to produce great sound, and they didn't block out the audio coming from around you. Now, in addition to the above, you also get durability from the elements with an IPX4 rating, and good battery life with the earbuds lasting up to 7.5 hours per use and an additional 19.5 hours with the charging case. As far as looks go, these do look a little bit out of the ordinary, as they clip onto your ear. The good news is that they fit securely, and more importantly, they are comfortable to wear, providing little to no stress with hours of use. So how do these differ from what you might expect from a normal pair of earbuds? Well, since they are open, you'll always hear what's around, which can be both a good and bad thing. Overall, these earbuds provide a niche experience that'll work for some people. Most modern earbuds offer audio pass through, which delivers the best of both worlds when ANC is also involved. But, if these sound like something you're looking for, we recommend at least giving them a try. They aren't cheap, but this recent deal at least brings them down way below their original price.",

But if you\u0026#39;re looking for something a little different, a pair of open earbuds might just be the thing. Now, if you\u0026#39;ve never heard of or tried open earbuds, they work a bit differently from conventional earbuds, in that they sit outside your ear canal, allowing you to naturally hear what\u0026#39;s happening around you.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n                        \n                \n    \n                                        \n    \n

The good news is that they fit securely, and more importantly, they are comfortable to wear, providing little to no stress with hours of use.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSo how do these differ from what you might expect from a normal pair of earbuds? Well, since they are open, you\u0026#39;ll always hear what\u0026#39;s around, which can be both a good and bad thing.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOverall, these earbuds provide a niche experience that\u0026#39;ll work for some people. Most modern earbuds offer audio pass through, which delivers the best of both worlds when ANC is also involved.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eBut, if these sound like something you\u0026#39;re looking for, we recommend at least giving them a try. They aren\u0026#39;t cheap, but this recent deal at least brings them down way below their original price.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
