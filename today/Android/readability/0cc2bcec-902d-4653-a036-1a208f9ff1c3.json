  "text": "If you’re after a new smartphone without breaking the bank, then you might want to check out what OnePlus offers with its Nord line of phones, which is relatively more affordable versus its flagship line. With that in mind, the OnePlus Nord N30 5G is certainly a tempting offer at the moment, with up to $50 off from its usual retail price via Amazon. While the N30 is an entry-level device, it does pack a decent set of features for the a relatively low price tag. The phone comes with a large 6.7-inch display with a smooth 120Hz refresh rate which makes it ideal for web browsing, movie streaming and games, a 108-megapixel main camera with additional sensors, a large 5,000 mAh battery with 50W fast-charging support, and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 695 chipset. You can grab the phone using the link below. Note: this article may contain affiliate links that help support our authors and keep the Phandroid servers running.",
