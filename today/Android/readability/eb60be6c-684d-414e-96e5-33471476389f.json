Priced at $129, the Edifier NeoDots come with a wide set of features that according to the company promise good sound quality. The NeoDots pack Hi-Res Audio Wireless certification, and come with balanced armature and 10mm dynamic drivers that work in tandem with advanced digital signal processing. There’s support for LDAC, AAC, and SBC codecs as well. Of course, active noise cancellation is likewise present, and the earbuds are capable of -48dB noise reduction. Users can also get up to 17 hours of playtime on a single charge (longer than most earbuds out there), with a total of 56 hours when using the charging case. A 15-minute top-up can also get you an additional 5 hours of use. Other features include built-in game mode with 80ms low latency, Bluetooth v5.4 compatibility, touch controls and wear detection.
