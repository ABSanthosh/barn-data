  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account YouTube Music is one of the best music streaming services available, thanks to its impressive catalog of music, along with delivering excellent recommendations thanks to its fantastic algorithm. It even manages to leverage YouTube videos, with the ability to convert them to audio on the fly, further expanding its library of content. So you can see why some prefer it over juggernauts like Spotify and Apple Music. Related 6 things YouTube Music does better than Spotify YouTube Music is a better choice than you think Of course, YouTube Music isn't perfect by any means, missing must-have features that you'll find on competitor services. With that said, the brand has been trying to close the gap, making small updates here and there to further improve the experience. Back in April, we reported that lyric-sharing was making its way to YouTube Music. And while we couldn't get it to work then, it's now seeing a wider roll-out, making it available to all Android and iOS users. The feature was covered by 9to5Google, and if you're a YouTube Music user, you should try and head into the lyrics section to see if sharing is now available. When playing whatever song you like, you can head into the Lyrics section, where you should see a Share button. Once you tap this button, you'll be taken to an alternate screen where the lyric you selected will be highlighted. If you want to highlight more lyrics, you can also do that on this screen as well. When you're done with the lyrics, you can hit Next, and you'll be shown the lyrics, along with the song and artist name on a card. You can then make this an image to share, or share it via your favorite social app. For the most part, it's not a vital feature to have, but it's something fun that could come in handy at some point. And it's important to note that this is not a paid feature, so if you're using YouTube Music for free, you should also see this available.",

features that you\u0026#39;ll find on competitor services. With that said, the brand has been trying to close the gap, making small updates here and there to further improve the experience. Back in April, we reported that \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-music-lyrics-sharing-android/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elyric-sharing was making its way to YouTube Music\u003c/a\u003e. And while we couldn\u0026#39;t get it to work then, it\u0026#39;s now seeing a wider roll-out, making it available to all Android and iOS users. \u003c/p\u003e        \n\u003cp\u003e The feature was \u003ca href=\"https://9to5google.com/2025/06/17/youtube-music-lyrics-sharing-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecovered by 9to5Google\u003c/a\u003e, and if you\u0026#39;re a YouTube Music user, you should try and head into the lyrics section to see if sharing is now available. When playing whatever song you like, you can head into the Lyrics section, where you should see a Share button.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eOnce you tap this button, you\u0026#39;ll be taken to an alternate screen where the lyric you selected will be highlighted. If you want to highlight more lyrics, you can also do that on this screen as well. When you\u0026#39;re done with the lyrics, you can hit Next, and you\u0026#39;ll be shown the lyrics, along with the song and artist name on a card.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eYou can then make this an image to share, or share it via your favorite social app. For the most part, it\u0026#39;s not a vital feature to have, but it\u0026#39;s something fun that could come in handy at some point. And it\u0026#39;s important to note that this is not a paid feature, so if you\u0026#39;re using YouTube Music for free, you should also see this available. \u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
