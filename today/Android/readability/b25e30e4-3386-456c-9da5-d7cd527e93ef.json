  "text": "Garmin Quatix 7X Solar Edition $600 $1100 Save $500 This is the smartwatch to get if you want one that can really do it all. Not only do you get an abundance of features, but this watch also looks quite good, making it perfect for all occasions. Perhaps what makes it unique, though, is its ability to connect and control your boat, if that sort of thing interests you. Regardless, this a fantastic watch to own, and is now $500 less. We've seen some pretty impressive deals on Garmin smartwatches over the past few weeks, but this promotion has to top them all, with a steep $500 discount that knocks the Garmin Quatix 7X Solar Edition to its lowest price ever. Now, the Quatix 7X Solar Edition is aimed at people who live a nautical lifestyle, but that doesn't mean Garmin skimped on the health and fitness tracking features on this model. In addition to all of the above, you also get an impressive design that looks great for any occasion. So, if you've been looking into upgrading from your current smartwatch, the Garmin Quatix 7X Solar Edition might be just the thing to go with. And while Prime Day is just around the corner, we wouldn't wait to pick this item up because the discount won't be around for long. What's great about the Garmin Quatix 7X Solar Edition? Let's get this out of the way. This is one of the best-looking watches from Garmin. Not only are you getting a large 1.4-inch touchscreen that's protected with sapphire, but the watch is also quite rugged and durable as well, with its fiber-reinforced polymer shell and titanium case. And battery life is also fantastic here, thanks to solar charging, which stretches normal use for up to 37 days. If you want to really push this watch to its limits, you can always extend the watch's battery life for up to one year. In addition to the touchscreen, you also get physical buttons that can be used to navigate the menu system. Plus, like other Garmin smartwatches, you're getting impressive health and fitness tracking through a variety of sensors, along with the ability to see stress level and sleep quality. You can also track your runs and map your hikes. And Garmin takes things a step further with thousands of maps for golf courses and ski resorts that are preloaded, along with preloaded topographic maps as well. And yes, since it's a smartwatch, you can get notifications to your wrist from a connected device, and also pay at supported checkout terminals using Garmin Pay. Now, what makes this watch a little more unique is its ability to connect to a boat, if you own one, and control it. That's right, if you have compatible hardware on your vessel, this watch will allow you to control it seamlessly without being at the wheel. You can also get data from your boat straight to your wrist and there are even maps available for salt and fresh water navigation. This really is a watch that can do it all, and the best part is that it's now on sale for a great price. Grab it from Amazon for $500 off while you can. Again, this is the best price we've seen on this watch, and we don't think a deal like this is coming back any time soon.",

Not only do you get an abundance of features, but this watch also looks quite good, making it perfect for all occasions. Perhaps what makes it unique, though, is its ability to connect and control your boat, if that sort of thing interests you. Regardless, this a fantastic watch to own, and is now $500 less.\u003c/p\u003e\n            \n            \n            \n\n            \n            \n            \n                            \n            \n            \n            \n\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026#39;ve seen some \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/garmin-epix-pro-gen-2-sapphire-edition-665-deal/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epretty impressive deals on Garmin smartwatches\u003c/a\u003e over the past few weeks, but this promotion has to top them all, with a steep $500 discount that knocks the Garmin Quatix 7X Solar Edition to its lowest price ever.

This is one of the best-looking watches from Garmin. Not only are you getting a large 1.4-inch touchscreen that\u0026#39;s protected with sapphire, but the watch is also quite rugged and durable as well, with its fiber-reinforced polymer shell and titanium case. And battery life is also fantastic here, thanks to solar charging, which stretches normal use for up to 37 days.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eIf you want to really push this watch to its limits, you can always extend the watch\u0026#39;s battery life for up to one year. In addition to the touchscreen, you also get physical buttons that can be used to navigate the menu system. Plus, like other Garmin smartwatches, you\u0026#39;re getting impressive health and fitness tracking through a variety of sensors, along with the ability to see stress level and sleep quality.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eYou can also track your runs and map your hikes. And Garmin takes things a step further with thousands of maps for golf courses and ski resorts that are preloaded, along with preloaded topographic maps as well. And yes, since it\u0026#39;s a smartwatch, you can get notifications to your wrist from a connected device, and also pay at supported checkout terminals using Garmin Pay.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eNow, what makes this watch a little more unique is its ability to connect to a boat, if you own one, and control it. That\u0026#39;s right, if you have compatible hardware on your vessel, this watch will allow you to control it seamlessly without being at the wheel. You can also get data from your boat straight to your wrist and there are even maps available for salt and fresh water navigation.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThis really is a watch that can do it all, and the best part is that it\u0026#39;s now on sale for a great price. Grab it from Amazon for $500 off while you can. Again, this is the best price we\u0026#39;ve seen on this watch, and we don\u0026#39;t think a deal like this is coming back any time soon.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
