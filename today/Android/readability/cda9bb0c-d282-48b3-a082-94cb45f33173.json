The release of the FreeArc mostly flew under the radar as it came alongside the Mate XT Ultimate global unveiling. It’s easy to see why people would be more interested in a tri-fold smartphone than a pair of relatively simple earphones. Still, we took our time to review them and found out they shined in certain scenarios. Table of Contents: Design Features Sound quality Battery life Verdict Design The FreeArc is ergonomically designed to provide a secure fit, featuring a hook that wraps around the ear. Since they have open-ear design, they offer excellent comfort and breathability. Huawei calls this the \"C-bridge Design\" — it essentially consists of three elements: the audio hardware next to the ear, the battery positioned behind the ear, and a thin wire that connects the two. Each earbud is made from a 0.7 mm high-performance Ni-Ti alloy, which is both flexible and durable, allowing it to adapt to any ear shape easily. The entire set is finished in soft silicone, and we received two color options: basic Black and the more striking Green. Thanks to the material’s grip and the overall shape, which Huawei calls the \"140-degree Optimal Triangle Design,\" the buds stay in place for hours and are comfortable to wear for long periods. Features The open-ear design lets you stay aware of your surroundings. The earpiece doesn't enter the ear canal, which can be both a blessing and a curse. On the positive side, you can listen to music and podcasts without blocking outside noise. However, while the sound quality is decent, the FreeArc wasn't designed to deliver a premium listening experience, so the audio can't be fully appreciated in the way some might hope. So, who are the FreeArc designed for? After putting them through multiple tests, we found that they excel in a few specific situations. One of these is running on a track. With its dual-resonator antenna, the FreeArc can maintain an uninterrupted Bluetooth connection at up to 400 meters per the company's claims. This makes it ideal for leaving your phone in your bag at the track while you run laps, though it's not as useful for a run around the park. Another scenario where the FreeArc shines is when making calls at home. You can forget about holding your phone, roaming around freely while talking without losing audio clarity. The microphones are well aimed at your mouth, ensuring clear communication. They also work well for casual walks in busy urban environments, where it's important to hear your surroundings. Because the FreeArc doesn't block the ear canal, it allows for the clear passage of external sounds while you enjoy your audio, making it a good choice for walking through unpredictable environments like crowded streets or public transport. However, there are some limitations. The FreeArc isn't suitable for use in noisy environments like gyms, where loud music could interfere with what you are trying to listen to. They also are far from ideal for road cycling — whether earbuds should be worn while cycling is debatable — but the FreeArc’s fit can obstruct things like sunglasses, helmets, or other headgear that wraps around the ear. Despite being IP57 rated for water and dust resistance, you shouldn't take the FreeArc to the pool. They’re uncomfortable with a swim cap, and they would likely fall off without one. Sound Quality The sound quality of the Huawei FreeArc is surprisingly solid given the price point. Equipped with a 17 mm x 12 mm driver, the earbuds deliver punchy bass and clear, balanced sound, making them suitable for a variety of audio content, from music to podcasts. However, because of the open-ear design, the audio experience isn't as immersive as in traditional in-ear or over-ear headphones. While the sound is clear and crisp, it's not intended to provide a high-end listening experience. The FreeArc excels in environments where you need to stay aware of your surroundings, but audiophiles should probably stay away from it. The dual-microphone layout, powered by AI noise filtering, ensures that calls are clear and uninterrupted, even in slightly noisy conditions. Battery Life Huawei doesn't typically quote battery capacity for its wearables, but during a conversation with journalists, we were told each bud contains a 55 mAh battery, and the case has a 510 mAh battery. It takes under an hour to charge the earbuds fully in the case, which only charges via USB-C; wireless charging was skipped on this model. On a full charge, we found the FreeArc lasts for over 6 hours of use at 75% volume, with some sessions extending to 6 hours and 30 minutes. The battery life is impressive, and with intermittent use throughout the day, they should last through a workweek without issue. Verdict All in all, Huawei has created a solid set of earbuds. The sound is clear and punchy, especially for the price, and they’re comfortable and lightweight. The battery life is excellent, making them a reliable option for daily use. That said, they’re best suited for quieter environments. Another downside is Huawei's wearables still struggle with Apple devices, even though both companies have made progress in improving battery performance and third-party integration. The FreeArc is priced at £99 in the UK and €99 in Europe (discounted from €119), and Huawei offers bundles on its website, such as a Band 9 or Watch Fit at half price in France or a second pair of FreeArc for an even lower price. Considering these deals, the FreeArc is definitely worth considering.",
