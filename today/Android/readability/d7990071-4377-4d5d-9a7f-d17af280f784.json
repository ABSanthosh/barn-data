Posting via his social media page over on Weibo, Oppo Product Manager Zhou Yibao confirmed that the X8 Ultra will make its debut later in April, although no specific launch date or event has been mentioned at this point in time. Unsurprisingly, no information regarding the phone’s specifications were given, although it’s highly expected that the Find X8 Ultra will pack some formidable camera hardware components, in addition to this year’s flagship chipset of choice, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite. READ: The Oppo Watch X2 Makes its Debut, and it Looks Really Familiar Interestingly, Oppo is also predicted to unveil several flagship phones under the X8 series, which will include the Dimensity-powered Find X8s as well as the Find X8 Next, a compact and thin handset which sounds like it’s designed to compete with the Galaxy S25 Edge and the rumored iPhone 17 “Air.” With all that being said, the next several weeks are about to get interesting especially for Oppo and Android fans.
