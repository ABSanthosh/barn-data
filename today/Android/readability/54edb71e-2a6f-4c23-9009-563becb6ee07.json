One UI 7 has been frustratingly late, and that’s a huge disappointment for Galaxy users. The last major update, One UI 6, came out just around late 2023. Its successor has somehow managed to drag into 2025 with delays, rollout pauses, and only a small number of devices actually getting it. What makes it even worse is that there are already serious talks about One UI 8 launching alongside Android 16. So before you even touch One UI 7, Samsung may have already moved on. In an interesting turn of events, we’re starting to see updates land for the Galaxy S23 series across Europe. They're only for beta users at the moment, and regular users still have to wait a little longer. In other words, a flagship from 2023 is only now getting last year’s software, five months into the new year. One UI 7 is set to rollout again if you still care Samsung’s most anticipated update is months late. The Android 15 based One UI 7 software is delayed because of serious problems right out of the gate. When the brand first pushed the update to Galaxy S24 users in South Korea, a bug appeared and locked people out of their phones if they were using SwiftKey as their keyboard. On top of that, there was another major privacy issue where private photos stored in the Secure Folder could accidentally show up in the Gallery app’s auto-generated Stories. If you saved anything you didn't want anyone to see, you most likely opened the app for a casual scroll, and suddenly saw your private photos stitched into a highlight reel. Image; Samsung Between the lockout bug and the privacy concerns, the brand had no choice but to stop the rollout and go back to the drawing board. Fortunately, the Galaxy S23 series is now getting One UI 7, following the revised schedule. The Galaxy S23, S23+, S23 Ultra, and S23 FE phones are receiving it in France and the UK. You'll get it if you were part of the One UI 7 beta program, so it’s technically still not a full public launch yet.  Related: Is Your Google Pixel Getting The Android 15 Update? More Galaxy phones to upgrade in May 2025 The latest One UI 7 update is 900MB large with the firmware number S91xBXXU8DYD9. This same version rolled out in South Korea last week for the S23 series. If you didn’t join the beta, your phone is still sitting on the older One UI 6 firmware. Expect a much larger 5GB+ update is expected to drop soon to unlock the full stable experience.  If you live within the UK and France, you should see the update notification immediately when the update is ready for installation on your phone. But you should also check in case you missed it. Go to Settings \u003e Software update \u003e Download and install.

They include the Galaxy S24 FE, the Galaxy Z Flip 5, the Galaxy Z Fold 5, and the Galaxy Tab S9 series. Irene is an experienced writer with four years in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.
