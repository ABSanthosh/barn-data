Right behind it we have one of the first smartphones to be announced in 2025 - the Redmi Turbo 4. We strongly suspect its international version dubbed Poco X7 Pro that will be introduced on January 9 will do at least as well next week. In third and fourth we have the 2024 popularity champions - the Galaxy A55 and the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Samsung Galaxy A55 Redmi Note 13 Pro took fifth, ahead of the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max and its stablemate, the vanilla Redmi Note 13. Samsung Galaxy A16 is back down to eight, while the Honor X9c enters the chart in ninth. That phone just got introduced for the European market, but under a different name - the Magic7 Lite. The final spot goes to the Redmi Note 14 Pro+, concluding our week 1 chart. There are already a few exciting announcements lined up for the next few weeks so it will be interesting to follow which ones will manage to make the top 10. Keep watching this space!",
