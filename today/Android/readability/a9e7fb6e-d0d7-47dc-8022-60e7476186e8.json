The TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra does pack some nifty features, in addition to pretty good battery life. As for what you can expect in terms of hardware, the TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra comes with a rugged design, and is powered by Google’s Wear OS platform. The watch also comes with 100+ professional sports modes, with built-in GPS, speaker and microphone, in addition to the usual array of health-tracking features. The watch also comes with pretty impressive battery life, which Mobvoi says can last up to 72 hours on standby and up to 45 days in Essential mode.
