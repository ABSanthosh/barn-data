Shipments will begin on June 12. IS a Galaxy Z Fold7 Ultra incoming? Well, an official Samsung teaser seemed to suggest as much, slipping the capitalized Ultra buzzword in a few places, but tipster Max Jambor suggested that there is no Ultra, just the Galaxy Z Fold7, which will supposedly be Ultra-quality. Ultra or just Fold7, we expect Samsung to bring out its next foldabls as early as July. While we can't share all the details yet, we can show off the exterior and talk about some of the features of this upcoming device. The Nothing Phone (3) and Nothing Headphone (1) are coming on July 1. The Nothing Phone (3) will come in black and white, and will start at $799 with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It will go up to $899 with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The Headphone (1) is an over-ear headphone that's should go on sale on September 30. Google's Pixel 10 series is coming. But when? At first, we heard that Google will honor the same August 13 unveil date as the Pixel 9 series. However, a later bit of info suggest that the launch event will be on August 20. We'll just have to wait and see. Huawei revealed the design of the upcoming Pura 80 Pro+, and it looks very much like its predecessor. The Pura 80 series is coming on June 11.",
