  "text": "AI and XR are coming together. See how glasses running Android XR are making AI even easier to use and creating new experiences. Last week, we shared how Gemini and Android work together to help you get things done on your phone, your watch, your TV and your car’s display. Now, we're thinking about where it can help you next. What if your AI assistant could see the world from your perspective and offer hands-free help?That’s the vision driving our latest advancements in Android XR. It’s the first Android platform built in the Gemini era, and it powers an ecosystem of headsets, glasses and everything in between.With Gemini on these devices, you can have an assistant that’s right there with you, sharing your vantage point, ready to help whenever you start the conversation. This frees up your hands so you can stay present and engaged with the world around you, whether it's real or virtual.When we introduced Android XR alongside Samsung and Qualcomm, we shared how headsets, like Samsung’s Project Moohan (coming later this year!), will offer immersive experiences on an infinite screen. Gemini makes Android XR headsets easier to use and more powerful by understanding what you're seeing and taking actions on your behalf. Ask about what you’re seeing with Gemini on Android XR headsets. Experiencing AI naturally with Android XR glassesToday on the Google I/O stage, we gave a deeper look at glasses with Android XR.For over a decade, we’ve been working on the concept of smart glasses. With Android XR, we’re taking a giant leap forward.Equipped with a camera, microphones and speakers, these glasses work in tandem with your phone, giving you access to your apps without ever having to reach in your pocket. And an optional in-lens display privately provides helpful information right when you need it. Pairing these glasses with Gemini means they see and hear what you do, so they understand your context, remember what's important to you and can help you throughout your day.Today's sneak peek showed how Android XR glasses will work in real-world scenarios, including messaging friends, making appointments, asking for turn-by-turn directions, taking photos and more. We even demoed live language translation between two people, showing the potential for these glasses to break down language barriers — giving you subtitles for the real world. See translations in real time to help you in new places. Get information and send messages while on-the-go. Find nearby points of interest and get heads-up directions. Capture the moment without reaching for your phone. Building glasses you’ll want to wearWe’re working with brands and partners to bring this technology to life.We know that glasses can only truly be helpful if you want to wear them all day. Today, we announced that we’re partnering with innovative eyewear brands, starting with Gentle Monster and Warby Parker, to create stylish glasses with Android XR. And in the future, we look forward to working with more partners, like Kering Eyewear, to bring even more options to users.As part of this work, we're also advancing our partnership with Samsung to go beyond headsets and extend Android XR to glasses. Together, we’re creating a software and reference hardware platform that will enable the ecosystem to make great glasses. Developers will be able to start building for this platform later this year.To help make sure we're building a truly assistive product that respects privacy for you and those around you, we've begun gathering feedback on our prototypes with trusted testers.
