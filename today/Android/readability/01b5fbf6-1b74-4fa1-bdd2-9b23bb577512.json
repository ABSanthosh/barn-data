While the global flip phone market is fairly rich, the options in the US are limited and Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip6 is basically counting down the days to retirement. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is equipped with a Snapdragon 8 Elite, so it’s ready to take on the next Z Flip. It is rated IP48 for particulate and water protection and has a fairly large 4,700mAh battery with fast 68W wired and 30W wireless charging. The Razr has a 7” inner and a 4” cover display, the latter is fully usable out of the box. The dual 50MP camera on the back has a main (with a small 1/1.95” sensor and OIS) and a 122° ultra-wide. The selfie camera on the inner display also has a 50MP sensor. The Motorola Razr+ 2025 is the middle option – a re-release of the Razr+ 2024 with an updated IP48 rating (up from IPX8) and a newer Android out of the box, version 15. This one is powered by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3, has a 6.9” inner and a 4” cover display and a 4,000mAh battery with 45W/15W charging. The dual 50MP camera has a different setup with a 2x/47mm telephoto lens instead of an ultra-wide. The main camera has a small 1/1.95” sensor (and OIS). The cheapest model of the family, the Motorola Razr 2025, is still at MSRP, but even now it is at $200 less than the Razr+ 2025. This one has just about the same inner display (6.9”, 1080p+, LTPO), though the cover display is smaller at 3.6”. The vanilla model is powered by a low-to-mid-range Dimensity 7400X chipset. It does have a bigger battery, 4,500mAh, with 30W wired and 15W wireless charging. The cameras are a 50MP main (1/1.95”, OIS) and a 13MP ultra-wide. Like the rest of the family, the Razr 2025 is rated IP48 for ingress protection. The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE price keeps fluctuating and is currently in the lower end of the range. While the Exynos 2400e is not the fastest chip in town, it’s still faster than the Tensor G4 found inside pricey phones like the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Of course, the 50+8+12MP camera can’t match the Pixels, but it does have the versatility of an 8MP 3x/75mm telephoto lens. And the phone will get six more OS updates (Android 15 is already here). The phone is rated IP68 and has a 4,700mAh battery with 25W wired and 15W wireless charging. Whatever happened to the Galaxy A56? It’s coming soon, but it may have a tough time justifying its price against the S24 FE. The cheaper alternative is the Galaxy A36 with a plastic frame and a Snapdragon 6 Gen 3. It has its limitations (IP67, macro camera instead of tele), but it will receive 6 OS updates – meaning this $300 phone has you covered until 2031. The A56 and the S24 FE will have to contend with the Motorola Edge (2025), which launched earlier this month. The Dimensity 7400 Ultra is rather weak – it’s behind A56’s Exynos 1580 and well behind the Exynos 2400e. However, the phone boasts an IP69 rating, a sharper 6.7” 1220p+ display and a 5,200mAh battery with 68W wired and 15W wireless charging. And the triple camera features not just a good 50MP 1/1.56” main sensor (OIS), but a 10MP 3x/73mm (OIS) telephoto and 50MP ultra-wide cameras. The price of the refreshed Apple iPad (2025) has been falling gradually and now sits at $300. As Apple seems to have turned away from AI features, the Apple A16 chipset doesn’t look so bad (its main flaw is that it doesn’t support Apple Intelligence). Samsung’s answer to the iPad is the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024), which costs about the same for a 128GB model, but has expandable storage. The Galaxy has a 10.4” LCD, compared to the iPad’s 11” IPS LCD, both run at 60Hz and both support a stylus (Samsung includes it for free). With basic DeX support, the Tab S6 Lite is better at multitasking. Next up, the Apple iPad Air 11 (2025) and Air 13 (2025) bring more performance with Apple M3 chips. These two models also have 60Hz IPS LCDs and with USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 and DisplayPort, they can multitask on an external monitor with Stage Manager. Even so, iPadOS is not as good as macOS for serious work. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE and Tab S10 FE+ offer similar sizes of display, 10.9” and 13.1”, respectively. Samsung at least had the decency to equip them with 90Hz IPS LCDs. These are powered by the Exynos 1580, which is much slower than an M3, but Android is more capable than iPadOS. DeX is supported, though the USB-C 2.0 port limits it only to the tablet’s own screen. We may get a commission from qualifying sales.",
