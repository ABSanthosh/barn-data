  "text": "Auto industry veteran Hyundai recently unveiled new teaser photos of the IONIQ 6 N, a full-electric vehicle which the company is marketing as a “high-performance electric sedan.” The company says that it’s designed the car with an emphasis on high-speed stability and aerodynamic efficiency. READ: The New Dolphin Surf is BYD’s Most Affordable EV Yet Not a lot can be seen from the initial teaser images, but Hyundai says that the car’s chassis is styled with flared fenders, a wider stance, as well as lightweight wheels and a large wing spoiler. It also continues the N series’ three core performance pillars which the company refers to as ‘Corner Rascal’, ’Racetrack Capability’ and ‘Everyday Sports Car’—big promises from Hyundai, but the manufacturer seems very confident that it will be able to successfully take over from the IONIQ 5 N. Joon Park, Vice President and Head of N Management Group comments: IONIQ 6 N will once again disrupt the high-performance EV segment to deliver exciting driving experiences to our fans… We chose to debut the IONIQ 6 N at Goodwood Festival of Speed to be as close to our fans as possible.
