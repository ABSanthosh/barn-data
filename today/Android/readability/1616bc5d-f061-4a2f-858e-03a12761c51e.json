The light blue will be \"very light\" according to one leaker, barely blue at all and more white in a lot of lighting scenarios. The subtlety theme continues with the light gold version, which is muted and not at all an in-your-face shade of gold. It seems like the overarching theme of this device will be lightness and thinness, and Apple doesn't want its colors to get in the way of that.

The iPhone 17 Air is now rumored to sport the A19 Pro chip, though a lesser version than the one featured in the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. Still, it's a step up from what the iPhone 16 Plus had to work with, and let's not forget that the iPhone 17 Air is replacing the iPhone 16 Plus. It will also get the same RAM amount as the Pros. So its only downsides will be the laughable battery capacity and the fact that it only has one rear camera. Perhaps a lot of people will be willing to overlook those in the name of thinness (5.5mm to 5.65mm) and lightness (145g). Via",
