  "text": "Summary PowerToys v0.92 stops Edge from hijacking web searches, now respects default browser choice. New features include custom Color Picker mouse actions \u0026 hidden system tray icon toggle. Command Palette updates for improved performance, hotkeys, stability, and better context items. I think one of my biggest pet peeves when getting into Windows 10 and 11 is how it always uses Edge, even when you have another browser set up as the default. These days, it's a lot easier to change that, but in the early days, it was a huge problem for me. PowerToys users got a nasty reminder of these times when the PowerToys Command Palette tool kept opening Edge instead of their default browser of choice when using Web Search. It seemingly only affected people who were using Windows 11 24H2, but it was still very annoying. Fortunately, the newest PowerToys release has squashed that bug, plus added a ton more additional fixes and features for you to try out. Related PowerToys version v0.92 stops Edge from hogging your web searches In the patch notes for PowerToys v0.92, Microsoft breaks down everything that was added to the new update. The change that's likely the most relieving for PowerToys Command Palette users on Windows 11 24H2 or newer is a tweak to how the Web Search feature works. Beforehand, using PowerToys Command Palette to perform a Web Search would force it through Edge, but now, it will respect your default browser choice. That's far from the only addition, though. If you're a big fan of using the PowerToys Color Picker, you can now customize the left, right, and middle mouse buttons to perform different tasks. If you're a PowerRename user, you can now use the $YY-$MM-$DD format in ModificationTime and AccessTime for better control over how your files are named. And while it's a small change, the new ability to hide the PowerToys system tray icon is very welcome. The Command Palette in particular had a big wave of updates. It now has better performance, more consistent hotkeys, a better presentation of \"critical context items,\" and better stability when handling thumbnails. If you want to grab this update, head over to the GitHub page linked above to download it, or open up PowerToys and fetch it that way. And if you've never given PowerToys a try, check out our articles on Adam becoming a PowerToys convert and why you should be using PowerToys on your Windows PC. If you want the full patch notes for version v0.92, here they are: Highlights PowerToys settings now has a toggle for the system tray icon, giving users control over its visibility based on personal preference. Thanks @BLM16! Command Palette now has Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compatibility for all first-party extensions, improved extensibility, and core UX fixes, resulting in better performance and stability across commands. Color Picker now has customizable mouse button actions, enabling more personalized workflows by assigning functions to left, right, and middle clicks. Thanks @PesBandi! Bug Report Tool now has a faster and clearer reporting process, with progress indicators, improved compression, auto-cleanup of old trace logs, and inclusion of MSIX installer logs for more efficient diagnostics. File Explorer add-ons now have improved rendering stability, resolving issues with PDF previews, blank thumbnails, and text file crashes during file browsing. Color Picker Added mouse button actions so you can choose what left, right, or middle click does. Thanks @PesBandi! Crop \u0026 Lock Aligned window styling with current Windows theme for a cleaner look. Thanks @sadirano! Command Palette Enhanced performance by resolving a regression in page loading. Applied consistent hotkey handling across all Command Palette commands for a smoother user experience. Improved graceful closing of Command Palette. Thanks @davidegiacometti! Fixed consistency issue for extensions' alias with \"Direct\" setting and enabled localization for \"Direct\" and \"Indirect\" for better user understanding. Thanks @davidegiacometti! Improved visual clarity by styling critical context items correctly. Automatically focused the field when only one is present on the content page. Improved stability and efficiency when loading file icons in SDK ThumbnailHelper.cs by removing unnecessary operations. Thanks @OldUser101! Enhanced details view with commands implementation. (See Extension sample) Command Palette extensions Added \"Copy Path\" command to App search results for convenience. Thanks @PesBandi! Improved Calculator input experience by ignoring leading equal signs. Thanks @PesBandi! Corrected input handling in the Calculator extension to avoid showing errors for input with only leading whitespace. Improved New Extension wizard by validating names to prevent namespace errors. Ensured consistent context items display for the Run extension between fallback and top-level results. Fixed missing Time \u0026 Date commands in fallback results. Thanks @htcfreek! Fixed outdated results in the Time \u0026 Date extension. Thanks @htcfreek! Fixed an issue where Web Search always opened Microsoft Edge instead of the user's default browser on Windows 11 24H2 and later. Thanks @RuggMatt! Improved ordering of Windows Settings extension search results from alphabetical to relevance-based for quicker access. Added \"Restart Windows Explorer\" command to the Windows System Commands provider for gracefully terminate and relaunch explorer.exe. Thanks @jiripolasek! Command Palette Ahead-of-Time (AOT) readiness We’ve made foundational changes to prepare the Command Palette for future Ahead-of-Time (AOT) publishing. This includes replacing the calculator library with ExprTk, improving COM object handling, refining Win32 interop, and correcting trimming behavior—all to ensure compatibility, performance, and reliability under AOT constraints. All first-party extensions are now AOT-compatible. These improvements lay the groundwork for publishing Command Palette as an AOT application in the next release. Special thanks to @Sergio0694 for guidance on making COM APIs AOT-compatible, @jtschuster for fixing COM object handling, @ArashPartow from ExprTk for integration suggestions, and @tian-lt from the Windows Calculator team for valuable suggestion throughout the migration journey and review. As part of the upcoming release, we’re also enabling AOT compatibility for key dependencies, including markdown rendering, Adaptive Cards, internal logging and telemetry library, and the core Command Palette UX. FancyZones Fixed DPI-scaling issues to ensure FancyZones Editor displays crisply on high-resolution monitors. Thanks @HO-COOH! This inspired us a broader review across other PowerToys modules, leading to DPI display optimizations in Awake, Color Picker, PowerAccent, and more. File Explorer add-ons Fixed potential failures in PDF previewer and thumbnail generation, improving reliability when browsing PDF files. Thanks @mohiuddin-khan-shiam! Prevented Monaco Preview Handler crash when opening UTF-8-BOM text files. Hosts File Editor Added an in-app “Learn more” link to warning dialogs for quick guidance. Thanks @PesBandi! Mouse Without Borders Fixed firewall rule so MWB now accepts connections from IPs outside your local subnet. Cleaned legacy logs to reduce disk usage and noise. Peek Updated QOI reader so 3-channel QOI images preview correctly in Peek and File Explorer. Thanks @mbartlett21! Added codec detection with a clear warning when a video can’t be previewed, along with a link to the Microsoft Store to download the required codec. PowerRename Added support for $YY-$MM-$DD in ModificationTime and AccessTime to enable flexible date-based renaming. PowerToys Run Suppressed error UI for known WPF-related crashes to reduce user confusion, while retaining diagnostic logging for analysis. This targets COMException 0xD0000701 and 0x80263001 caused by temporary DWM unavailability. Registry Preview Added \"Extended data preview\" via magnifier icon and context menu in the Data Grid, enabled easier inspection of complex registry types like REG_BINARY, REG_EXPAND_SZ, and REG_MULTI_SZ, etc. Thanks @htcfreek! Improved file-saving experience in Registry Preview by aligning with Notepad-like behavior, enhancing user prompts, error handling, and preventing crashes during unsaved or interrupted actions. Thanks @htcfreek! Settings Added an option to hide or show the PowerToys system tray icon. Thanks @BLM16! Improved settings to show progress while a bug report package is being generated. Workspaces Stored Workspaces icons in user AppData to ensure profile portability and prevent loss during temporary folder cleanup. Enabled capture and launch of PWAs on non-default Edge or Chrome profiles, ensuring consistent behavior during creation and execution. Documentation Added SpeedTest and Dictionary Definition to the third-party plugins documentation for PowerToys Run. Thanks @ruslanlap! Corrected sample links and typo in Command Palette documentation. Thanks @daverayment and @roycewilliams! Development Updated .NET libraries to 9.0.6 for performance and security. Thanks @snickler! Updated WinAppSDK to 1.7.2 for better stability and Windows support. Introduced a one-step local build script that generates a signed installer, enhancing developer productivity. Generated portable PDBs so cross-platform debuggers can read symbol files, improving debugging experience in VSCode and other tools. Simplified WinGet configuration files by using the Microsoft.Windows.Settings module to enable Developer Mode. Thanks @mdanish-kh! Adjusted build scripts for the latest Az.Accounts module to keep CI green. Streamlined release pipeline by removing hard-coded telemetry version numbers, and unified Command Palette versioning with Windows Terminal's versioning method for consistent updates. Enhanced the build validation step to show detailed differences between NOTICE.md and actual package dependencies and versions. Improved spell-checking accuracy across the repo. Thanks @rovercoder! Upgraded CI to TouchdownBuild v5 for faster pipelines. Added context comments to Resources.resw to help translators. Expanded fuzz testing coverage to include FancyZones. Integrated all unit tests into the CI pipeline, increasing from ~3,000 to ~5,000 tests. Enabled daily UI test automation on the main branch, now covering over 370 UI tests for end-to-end validation. Newly added unit tests for WorkspacesLib to improve reliability and maintainability. General Updated bug report compression library (cziplib 0.3.3) for faster and more reliable package creation.

nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePowerToys v0.92\u003c/a\u003e, Microsoft breaks down everything that was added to the new update. The change that\u0026#39;s likely the most relieving for PowerToys Command Palette users on Windows 11 24H2 or newer is a tweak to how the Web Search feature works. Beforehand, using PowerToys Command Palette to perform a Web Search would force it through Edge, but now, it will respect your default browser choice. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#39;s far from the only addition, though. If you\u0026#39;re a big fan of using the PowerToys Color Picker, you can now customize the left, right, and middle mouse buttons to perform different tasks. If you\u0026#39;re a PowerRename user, you can now use the $YY-$MM-$DD format in ModificationTime and AccessTime for better control over how your files are named. And while it\u0026#39;s a small change, the new ability to hide the PowerToys system tray icon is very welcome.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe Command Palette in particular had a big wave of updates. It now has better performance, more consistent hotkeys, a better presentation of \u0026#34;critical context items,\u0026#34; and better stability when handling thumbnails.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eIf you want to grab this update, head over to the GitHub page linked above to download it, or open up PowerToys and fetch it that way.
