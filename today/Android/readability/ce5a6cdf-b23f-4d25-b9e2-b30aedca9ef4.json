Part of Google’s official announcement reads: Over the coming months, we’re upgrading more users on mobile devices from Google Assistant to Gemini; and later this year, the classic Google Assistant will no longer be accessible on most mobile devices or available for new downloads on mobile app stores. Google adds that it will upgrade other devices such as tablets, smart auto systems and other compatible IoT hardware to Gemini in the coming months. Until then though, Google says that users will be able to keep using Google Assistant on their devices. READ: Gemini Users can now Add Events to their Calendar from Gmail While Gemini’s initial launch as an Assistant on Android devices was somewhat rocky especially when it came to device commands, Google has since improved the user experience by offloading certain commands to Google Assistant from Gemini. With this upcoming change however, we’re still yet to see how seamless the transition will be. A writer and content creator with a love for tech and music, Mike is also an avid gamer as well.
