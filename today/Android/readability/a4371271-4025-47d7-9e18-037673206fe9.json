Whether it's going to be announced alongside the Galaxy Z Fold7 and Galaxy Z Flip7 at its next Unpacked event in New York in early July remains to be seen. Regardless, the device is currently engaged in the global certifications dance, specifically it's been spotted in China's 3C database. This certification has revealed that the phone will only support 25W wired charging. Of course, a certification in China also confirms that the handset will launch over there. The tri-fold smartphone has the model number SM-F9680, where the \"0\" suffix signifies a phone intended for the Chinese market. Across the world, it will be SM-F968x, with the last character changing depending on market. SM-F968 has previously been associated with the tri-fold device. Unsurprisingly, the 3C certification also reveals the fact that Samsung will ship the tri-fold smartphone without a charger in the box. According to past leaks, the device will have a 9.96\" folding screen and a 6.54\" cover display, and will weigh 298g. Its release might be very geographically limited. Via",
