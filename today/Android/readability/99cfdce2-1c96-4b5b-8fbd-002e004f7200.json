  "text": "BitmoLab has announced an upgraded version of its GAMEBABY case. This is a case that transforms the iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPhone 16 Pro Max into a retro gaming console. The GAMEBABY isn’t a new accessory, but the latest iteration of the GAMEBABY sports a sleeker design. It is made with metal and silicone for a more premium feel, replacing the plastic-silicone blend of the previous model. While still offering reliable protection for your iPhone, it also functions as a detachable game controller that mimics the iconic layouts of 16-bit consoles from the 90s. If you’re learning about the GAMEBABY for the first time, it appears to be a standard protective case on the surface. However, its bottom half detaches and snaps onto the front of the phone. It instantly transforms into a physical game controller that enhances the retro game experience. Once you’re done gaming, reattach the controller to the back, and it seamlessly becomes a full-fledged case again. The GAMEBABY replicates the feel of classic 16-bit controllers, offering tactile buttons that enhance gameplay. The dual-purpose design ensures your iPhone remains protected while doubling as a retro gaming console whenever you want. It supports popular emulators like Delta, giving players access to thousands of classic games. If you’re interested, the early bird price for the new GAMEBABY is $24.99, with shipments expected to begin mid-to-late March.",
