  "text": "Samsung 9100 Pro SSD $270 $300 Save $30 An impressive Gen5 SSD that delivers excellent performance at an even better price. Score $30 off right now as this 2TB model drops to its best price yet. Despite it being introduced some years ago, the Samsung 990 Pro is still one of the best SSDs that you can buy right now. So it only makes sense that the brand would come out with something better when going to Gen5, and the 9100 Pro delivers. With blazing-fast performance that can reach up to 14,800MB/s, this SSD is a no-brainer if you're looking for one of the best PCIe 5.0 SSDs. Related The best part is that this SSD is now seeing a discount that brings it down to its best price yet. For a limited time, you can score $30 off the retail price on the 2TB model, which brings it down to $270. While this isn't the steepest discount, as mentioned before, this is the lowest price we've seen on this model to date. So get it while you can. What's great about the Samsung 9100 Pro SSD? This is one of those SSDs you buy if you're looking to get the best performance possible. When it comes down to it, you're getting impressive numbers, with sequential read speeds that can reach up to 14,800MB/s, and sequential write speeds that can top out at 13,400MB/s. For the most part, this SSD is going to be right at home no matter what you throw at it, making it a versatile storage solution. This Gen5 SSD can be used in desktops and laptops. Furthermore, you can also use it on Gen4 devices as well, but you shouldn't expect to see the best performance numbers here since the device itself will be limited. Naturally, this SSD also comes with impressive thermal management to keep it cool when running at peak, which makes it perfect for use even in tight spaces. Of course, if you need the extra cooling, Samsung does sell a model that comes with a heatsink attached. For the most part, you can't go wrong here, as this drive delivers excellent performance. Just be sure to grab it while it's still on sale, because the $30 you save can make a huge difference if you're buying multiple or just even buying one for a fresh PC build.",
