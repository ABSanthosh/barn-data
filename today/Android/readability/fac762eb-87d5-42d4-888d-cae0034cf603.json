This was the era when cover systems were optional, objectives weren't hand-held, and healing was done through medkits instead of just standing still. Many games in this era helped shape the DNA of the modern shooter, pushing hardware and game design forward. Sadly, they're nowhere to be found today — not on storefronts, not in remasters, and not even the conversations younger players have. Once the backbone of the genre, these fantastic FPS titles from our childhoods are now ghosts.

Rough around the edges, but the I.G.I. series found a cult following \"Where's my guy?\", I'd asked my brother when he showed me Project I.G.I. somewhere in the early 2000s. That's right, Project I.G.I. was the very first FPS game I ever saw, and I was amazed at the concept of a first-person perspective in-game. The series spawned two sequels, and it did manage to build up a cult following over the years. However, plans for a follow-up just never went anywhere. That was until 2022, when, after nineteen years, a new I.G.I. game was announced. I.G.I. Origins, a third game, was announced with a cinematic trailer, and would be made on Unreal Engine 5. Project I.G.I. itself was a technical pioneer, and the second game was lauded for its graphics, which were better than the standard at the time. So, it made perfect sense that I.G.I. Origins would be using Unreal Engine 5's capabilities. Now, for all those who grew up playing the two I.G.I. games in the 2000s, this was great news, and I myself joined the official Discord server for the devs for any and all updates. Sadly, the studio was shut down just a year after the announcement, and the parent company said in their statement that I.G.I. Origins' development hadn't \"produced sufficient traction\". Today, the third I.G.I. game's Steam page is a desolate place to visit, with no gameplay or release date information — just the announcement trailer and a bunch of screenshots. Project I.G.I.: I'm Going In Systems Released December 8, 2000 Developer(s) Innerloop Studios Publisher(s) Eidos Interactive Set in post-Soviet Russia in a time of corruption and blackmail. You take on the role of David Llewelyn Jones, an ex SAS soldier who has been sent on a black Ops mission to capture a stolen US nuclear weapon and prevent a second Chernobyl disaster.

While a technical powerhouse, DOOM 3 felt rather different from the first two games that had made the game such a staple of the FPS genre. As such, the studio decided to work on an all-new IP, and Rage was born. This franchise would have Doom's signature crunchy gunplay, but also open-world exploration and vehicular combat — two ideas the company had always wanted to work on. The first Rage game was actually received well because it got a lot of things right, even though its world felt just a little bit hollow. Then, out of nowhere, Rage 2 showed up, almost a decade later in 2019. This time around, the game had a more grim vibe, but also more powers, madness, and color. Sadly, Rage 2 came and went without leaving much of a dent, which is something I will always be mad about. The combat was fantastic, yes, but everything else around it was so half-baked that the wasted potential alone drove me up the wall. Thanks to the misstep that was Rage 2, the series never found its rhythm, and today, it's remembered more for its potential than its actual legacy. Props to the Rage franchise, though — not many games manage to fade into obscurity twice.

My first brush with it was probably Allied Assault, although truth be told, I can't even remember (which is the whole point of this). Medal of Honor had everything going for it — the series gave us heart, cinematic flair, and missions in war that felt so human — something rare for shooters at the time. However, once Infinity Ward was formed and former Medal of Honor devs went over, Call of Duty started eating Medal of Honor's lunch. From there, the decline of this decorated franchise was quick and brutal. EA even tried to rejuvenate and revive the series in 2010, but it was clear that they had gone the \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\" route, and 2010's Medal of Honor lacked any sort of identity. The sequel, Warfighter, tanked even harder, which became the final nail in the coffin. Credit where it's due, though — they still attempted a revival in 2020 with a VR title, but everyone and their dog had moved on by then. Medal of Honor didn't just fade — it was outclassed by the very people who once made it great.

To this day, no game has combined traditional, tactical FPS action with psychological horror quite like F.E.A.R. did. I still remember the first time Alma showed up — I must've been eight or nine years old, wondering why I was feeling afraid while holding an assault rifle, of all things. The F.E.A.R. series is known as a true masterpiece — well, at least some of it. The game leveraged a remarkably intelligent A.I. for its time, which was so clever that enemies would flank, flush, and corner you, instead of just ducking into cover and waiting to eat a bullet. F.E.A.R. 2 and 3 tried expanding Alma's lore, but in doing so, they failed to balance terror and tactics quite like the first game. The series itself went through a lot of hoops to get where it did — publishers kept changing, and the rights of the IP became messier than Alma's retconned story. F.E.A.R. 3 was much like Dead Space 3 — solid gameplay, but the horror elements were just not there. So, the game received mixed reviews, and the franchise just... fizzled out. The remarkable F.E.A.R. games will always have the bones of a brilliant series, but they have become a relic of a time when FPS games could still innovate, but not just for the sake of innovation.

Within the first half hour, I'd seen more limbs fly than in any war movie. Soldier of Fortune made you feel every bullet, which, as I later found out, was thanks to its remarkable GHOUL damage system. It was brutal, it was gory, and it was gloriously over-the-top. But underneath the carnage was actually a pretty solid tactical shooter with great weaponry. Then came Soldier of Fortune II, built on the id Tech engine, and it made everything better. The gunplay was tighter, and the mercenary fantasy kept players like me hooked. However, in the PS3/Xbox360 era, when the third game, Payback, came out, it was pretty much a nothingburger. It looked like one of the hundreds of shooters out there at the time, and felt like a straight-to-DVD sequel — soulless. And this was because it was never a Soldier of Fortune game — it was just another shooter that Activision slapped the Soldier of Fortune name-tag on at the last minute to sell it for full price. From then on, it was radio silence — this could very well have been a long-standing FPS series known for its tactical depth and adult tone, but instead, it got buried under a pile of forgettable imitators. I truly believe that Soldier of Fortune could actually thrive today, since we're back in the age of gritty realism and visceral combat, but I'm not quite sure the publishers would have the guts for it.

Publisher Activision Related 10 games that were so bad they killed their franchises A lot of game franchises have bad releases, but these 10 sunk their entire franchise all together These FPS titles helped build the tactical-FPS foundation Once the backbone of the genre, these games are now ghosts. These memorable FPS titles were never just one-hit wonders — they were building blocks that defined an entire era. Sure, time hasn't been kind to them, but I would be the first in line for a proper comeback. It hurts to see how casually these franchises were discarded or left to obscurity. In a genre where \"innovation\" is now just done for innovation's sake with a \"make FPS great again\" hat on top of it, maybe it's time we finally started listening to the titles we left behind.

That\u0026#39;s right, \u003cem\u003eProject I.G.I.\u003c/em\u003e was the very first FPS game I ever saw, and I was amazed at the concept of a first-person perspective in-game. The series spawned two sequels, and it did manage to build up a cult following over the years. However, plans for a follow-up just never went anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThat was until 2022, when, after nineteen years, a new \u003cem\u003eI.G.I.\u003c/em\u003e game was announced. \u003cem\u003eI.G.I. Origins\u003c/em\u003e, a third game, was announced with a cinematic trailer, and would be \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/tired-of-broken-pc-ports-heres-how-unreal-engine-is-fixing-the-problem/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emade on Unreal Engine 5\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cem\u003eProject I.G.I.\u003c/em\u003e itself was a technical pioneer, and the second game was lauded for its graphics, which were better than the standard at the time. So, it made perfect sense that \u003cem\u003eI.G.I. Origins\u003c/em\u003e would be using Unreal Engine 5\u0026#39;s capabilities. Now, for all those who grew up playing the two \u003cem\u003eI.G.I. \u003c/em\u003egames in the 2000s, this was great news, and I myself joined the official Discord server for the devs for any and all updates.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eSadly, \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/great-game-studios-that-shut-down/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe studio was shut down\u003c/a\u003e just a year after the announcement, and the parent company \u003ca href=\"https://www.enadglobal7.com/press-releases/enad-global-7-initiates-the-process-to-wind-down-antimatter-games-in-the-uk/#:~:text=However%2C%20these%20efforts%20have%20not%20produced%20sufficient%20traction%20within%20the%20Group%E2%80%99s%20target%20timeline.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esaid in their statement\u003c/a\u003e that \u003cem\u003eI.G.I.

While a technical powerhouse, \u003cem\u003eDOOM 3\u003c/em\u003e felt rather different from the first two games that had made the game such a staple of the FPS genre. As such, the studio decided to work on an all-new IP, and \u003cem\u003eRage \u003c/em\u003ewas born. This franchise would have \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/doom-the-dark-ages-reminded-me-how-fun-old-school-archetypes-can-be/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eDoom\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#39;s signature crunchy gunplay\u003c/a\u003e, but also open-world exploration and vehicular combat — two ideas the company had always wanted to work on. The first \u003cem\u003eRage \u003c/em\u003egame was actually received well because it got a lot of things right, even though its world felt just a little bit hollow.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThen, out of nowhere, \u003cem\u003eRage 2\u003c/em\u003e showed up, almost a decade later in 2019. This time around, the game had a more grim vibe, but also more powers, madness, and color. Sadly, \u003cem\u003eRage 2 \u003c/em\u003ecame and went without leaving much of a dent, which is something I will always be mad about. The combat was fantastic, yes, but everything else around it was so half-baked that the wasted potential alone drove me up the wall. Thanks to the misstep that was \u003cem\u003eRage 2\u003c/em\u003e, the series never found its rhythm, and today, it\u0026#39;s remembered more for its potential than its actual legacy.

shooter in everyone\u0026#39;s libraries, \u003cem\u003eMedal of Honor\u003c/em\u003e was the crown jewel. My first brush with it was probably \u003cem\u003eAllied Assault\u003c/em\u003e, although truth be told, I can\u0026#39;t even remember (which is the whole point of this). \u003cem\u003eMedal of Honor\u003c/em\u003e had everything going for it — the series gave us heart, cinematic flair, and missions in war that felt so \u003cem\u003ehuman\u003c/em\u003e — something rare for shooters at the time.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eHowever, once Infinity Ward was formed and former \u003cem\u003eMedal of Honor\u003c/em\u003e devs went over,\u003cem\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/activision-vs-call-of-duty-cheaters/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCall of Duty\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e started eating \u003cem\u003eMedal of Honor\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#39;s lunch. From there, the decline of this decorated franchise was quick and brutal. EA even tried to rejuvenate and revive the series in 2010, but it was clear that they had gone the \u0026#34;if you can\u0026#39;t beat \u0026#39;em, join \u0026#39;em\u0026#34; route, and 2010\u0026#39;s \u003cem\u003eMedal of Honor \u003c/em\u003elacked any sort of identity. The sequel, \u003cem\u003eWarfighter\u003c/em\u003e, tanked even harder, which became the final nail in the coffin. Credit where it\u0026#39;s due, though — they still attempted a revival in 2020 with a VR title, but everyone and their dog had moved on by then. \u003cem\u003eMedal of Honor\u003c/em\u003e

To this day, no game has combined traditional, tactical FPS action with psychological horror quite like \u003cem\u003eF.E.A.R.\u003c/em\u003e did. I still remember the first time Alma showed up — I must\u0026#39;ve been eight or nine years old, wondering why \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/horror-games-my-teenage-self-was-too-scared-to-finish/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI was feeling \u003cem\u003eafraid\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e while holding an assault rifle, of all things. The \u003cem\u003eF.E.A.R.\u003c/em\u003e series is known as a true masterpiece — well, at least some of it. The game leveraged a remarkably intelligent A.I. for its time, which was so clever that enemies would flank, flush, and corner you, instead of just ducking into cover and waiting to eat a bullet.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eF.E.A.R. 2 \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003e3\u003c/em\u003e tried expanding Alma\u0026#39;s lore, but in doing so, they failed to balance terror and tactics quite like the first game. The series itself went through a lot of hoops to get where it did — publishers kept changing, and the rights of the IP became messier than Alma\u0026#39;s retconned story. \u003cem\u003eF.E.A.R. 3\u003c/em\u003e was \u003ca href=\"https://screenrant.com/dead-space-4-sequel-unlikely-ea-op-ed/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emuch like \u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://screenrant.com/dead-space-4-sequel-unlikely-ea-op-ed/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDead Space 3\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003e— solid gameplay, but the horror elements were just not there. So, the game received mixed reviews, and the franchise just... fizzled out. The remarkable \u003cem\u003eF.E.A.R. \u003c/em\u003egames will always have the bones of a brilliant series, but they have become a relic of a time when FPS games could still innovate, but not just

was at an Internet café, where I went to get some printouts done. Within the first half hour, I\u0026#39;d seen more limbs fly than in any war movie. \u003cem\u003eSoldier of Fortune\u003c/em\u003e made you \u003cem\u003efeel\u003c/em\u003e every bullet, which, as I later found out, was thanks to its remarkable GHOUL damage system. It was brutal, it was gory, and it was gloriously over-the-top. But underneath the carnage was actually a pretty solid tactical shooter with great weaponry.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThen came \u003cem\u003eSoldier of Fortune II\u003c/em\u003e, built on \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/doom-dark-ages-id-tech-hands-on/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe id Tech engine\u003c/a\u003e, and it made everything better. The gunplay was tighter, and the mercenary fantasy kept players like me hooked. However, in the PS3/Xbox360 era, when the third game, \u003cem\u003ePayback\u003c/em\u003e, came out, it was pretty much a nothingburger. It looked like one of the hundreds of shooters out there at the time, and felt like a straight-to-DVD sequel — soulless.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eAnd this was because it was never a \u003cem\u003eSoldier of Fortune\u003c/em\u003e game — it was just another shooter that Activision slapped the \u003cem\u003eSoldier of Fortune \u003c/em\u003ename-tag on at the last minute to sell it for full price. From then on, it was radio silence — this could very well have been a \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/ea-scared-gta-6s-release-window/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elong-standing FPS series\u003c/a\u003e known for its tactical depth and adult tone, but instead, it got buried under a pile of forgettable imitators.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eI truly believe that\u003cem\u003e Soldier of Fortune \u003c/em\u003ecould actually thrive today, since we\u0026#39;re back in the age of gritty realism and visceral combat, but I\u0026#39;m not quite sure the publishers would have the
