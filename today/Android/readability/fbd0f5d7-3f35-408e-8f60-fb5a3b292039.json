That said, earphones are just more practical when I’m on the go. That’s why I keep a pair of AirPods Pro for travel and working outside. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Review (SAVE $400!) They’re decent in the gym, but once I start sweating, they slip out. And I hate how completely cut off I feel when they’re on. The noise cancellation is too good. Even with transparency mode, it’s not quite enough. I still feel disconnected from my surroundings. So when AceFast sent over their AceFit Pro open-ear earphones, I was intrigued. Design \u0026 Fit The AceFit Pro has a much larger footprint than my AirPods, but surprisingly, they’re not heavier. The hook design is a nice touch, and it’s way more secure than the typical in-ear fit, especially for workouts. They come with a charging case, which is standard these days. But there’s a glowing battery display on the top that feels a bit over the top. I would’ve preferred simple LEDs. The glowing AceFit logos on the earbuds themselves? Also unnecessary. It feels like branding for branding’s sake. The case charges via USB-C, but the port is on the bottom. So yeah, just like Apple’s Magic Mouse, you can’t charge and use it at the same time. Not a dealbreaker, but definitely annoying. No physical buttons here. You’ll have to swipe to control playback, volume, and more. There’s an app that lets you remap gestures and tweak the EQ with a few presets. It works, but it’s nothing special. Sound Quality Sound-wise, they’re…fine. Not great, not terrible. If your playlist leans acoustic or vocal-heavy, you’ll actually get some decent separation. Clean guitars and vocals sound pretty clear. But don’t expect any real bass. On tracks like John Mayer’s Why Georgia, the bass and drums felt anemic. Trance and EDM tracks lacked punch, especially during the drop. If you’re into bass-heavy music, you’ll be disappointed. As a daily driver? I’d pass. But for workouts? They’re serviceable. You won’t be blown away, but you won’t hate them either. Open-Ear Comfort The open-ear design means these sit just outside your ear canal. If you hate the feeling of earbuds jammed in your ears, this is a win. It also means you can hear what’s happening around you, which is great if you’re running outside or just like being aware of your surroundings. In this regard, I really liked the AceFit Pro. They don’t completely block out the world, which I appreciate, especially at the gym. And because of the hook design, they stayed in place through a full workout—weights, cardio, and all. My AirPods tend to slip out once I’m sweaty, even when I’m standing still. So this was a major plus. Battery Life This is where things start to fall apart. Battery life isn’t great. AceFast claims 8 hours on a single charge, and 32 hours with the case, but only at 60% volume. Let’s be real: with open-ear buds, you’re probably listening louder than that. I was getting around 6 hours per charge, which is close to spec, but it felt shorter in real-world use. It’s fine for a workout or two, but not much more. Final Verdict So, should you buy them? Honestly, not at $125. The sound is just okay, the battery life is average at best, and the glowing branding feels unnecessary. You could spend a bit more and get something better. Or spend less and get something similar. The AceFit Pro’s biggest selling point is comfort and security during workouts. That’s about it. If that’s your main concern, they might be worth a look. But for everyone else, there are better options out there. Note: this article may contain affiliate links that help support our authors and keep the Phandroid servers running.",
