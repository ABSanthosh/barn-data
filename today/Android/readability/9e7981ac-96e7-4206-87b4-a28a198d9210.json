  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account One UI 7 is shaping up to be one of the most in-demand software updates of 2025. While Galaxy S25 devices have had it since launch, it's been a few months, and we're now just finally seeing it arrive on a handful older devices. And while some might be disappointed with the roll-out, it looks like things are going to be moving along a little faster than first anticipated. Related The latest news comes from Sammy Fans, reporting that Samsung Vietnam has shared a schedule of when the One UI 7 update will arrive for other devices. While this doesn't reflect when the US will get these updates, we have to imagine that the timing is going to be pretty close for other regions, so it gives eager Samsung fans something to look forward to. An avalanche of updates As far as the dates, starting next week, Samsung reports that the update will be rolling out to the Galaxy S24 and S23 series, along with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 series as well. Furthermore, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5 series should also see the update as well. Starting on April 23, Galaxy S24 FE owners should see the update, followed by the Galaxy S23 FE, Galaxy S21 series, and Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Z Flip 4 devices on April 24. After that, on April 28, the update should roll out to the Galaxy S22 series, along with the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3. For the most part, it seems like One UI 7 is seeing a pretty widespread release in April, which should make device owners happy. Of course, it remains to be seen whether all of this comes to fruition. And again, these are dates set by Samsung Vietnam, so the timeline could be different for other regions. With that said, we're hoping that the update rolls out fairly smoothly to other regions, and the One UI 7 will be on the majority of modern Samsung devices by the end of April. While the delayed roll-out of One UI 7 was a bit of a mess, Samsung could make it up by releasing One UI 8 early. And while there isn't anything concrete yet, some early rumors are suggesting that we could first see the update go live as early as this summer with the release of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7. Of course, we'll probably hear more about that the closer we get to the release window of those phones.",

While this doesn\u0026#39;t reflect when the US will get these updates, we have to imagine that the timing is going to be pretty close for other regions, so it gives eager Samsung fans something to look forward to. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"an-avalanche-of-updates\"\u003e\n                        An avalanche of updates\n               \u003c/h2\u003e    \n\n\u003cp\u003e As far as the dates, starting next week, Samsung reports that the update will be rolling out to the Galaxy S24 and S23 series, along with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 series as well.
