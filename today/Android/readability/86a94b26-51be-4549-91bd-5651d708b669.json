Currently, the service will only be available for US subscribers, who will be able to check out Apple’s entertainment offerings (if they haven’t yet). Amazon Prime Video members who choose to add Apple TV+ to their content subscriptions will have access to exclusive programming with series and films including Severance, Slow Horses, The Morning Show, as well as Major League Soccer and Major League Baseball sporting events. Mike Hopkins, Senior Vice President and Head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios comments: Prime Video is a first-stop entertainment destination offering a wide selection of premium programming including Amazon MGM Studios Originals, live sports, licensed movies and series, the industry’s largest catalog of titles to rent or buy, and over 100 additional streaming subscriptions… As we continue to expand our offering and make it easy for customers to personalize their streaming experience directly in one app, we are proud to welcome Apple TV+ and its popular and critically-acclaimed shows, films and events to Prime Video.
