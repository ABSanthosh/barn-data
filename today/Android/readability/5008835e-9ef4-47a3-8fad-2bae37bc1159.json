  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account With summer just around the corner, we know that Samsung's next foldables are on the way, which means the brand has now started its promotional campaign by teasing possible technology we might see in its upcoming phones. And while we don't have all the details quite yet, we do have some credible leaks that indicate the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be quite thin, while also sporting a huge camera bump. Related It remains to be seen whether Samsung's foldables will deliver when it comes to camera features and quality, but the brand seems to think so with its upcoming AI-powered features. While it was deliberately vague in its own press release, we're getting news that the brand could possibly debut something called GalaxyAI Pro-Visual Engine (via Android Headlines). Will Samsung's AI tech make its cameras better? Of course, it's important we take this information with a bit of skepticism, since we haven't seen anything confirming this detail as of now. According to PandaFlashX, the new AI tech will bring some notable camera improvements when it comes to Samsung's upcoming foldables. If the news we're seeing today pans out, you can expect the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 to get improved image quality with better digital zoom and enhanced stability when taking videos. For the most part, this all seems quite reasonable, considering we've seen other brands make these types of improvements using software as well. The big news here is that this AI technology could be implemented in some of Samsung's other phones as well. Although we don't expect it to find its way to the brand's older phones immediately, PandaFlashX shares that it could make its way to the Galaxy S25 series at the very least. Samsung's done some pretty great things when it comes to implementing AI in its devices, debuting Circle to Search, which has become one of the biggest features to come to Android devices in quite some time. For that reason, we have some big expectations when it comes to its upcoming AI tech that will be featured in its new foldable phones. Of course, we've seen some bad implementations of AI as well, with some feeling that Galaxy AI leaves more to be desired. Luckily, we won't have to wait long to find out how Samsung will take its foldables and Galaxy AI to the next level. While we don't know when the new phones are coming, we do expect them to be here within the next couple of months.",

new AI tech will bring some notable camera improvements when it comes to Samsung\u0026#39;s upcoming foldables. If the news we\u0026#39;re seeing today pans out, you can expect the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 to get improved image quality with better digital zoom and enhanced stability when taking videos.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eFor the most part, this all seems quite reasonable, considering we\u0026#39;ve seen other brands make these types of improvements using software as well. The big news here is that this AI technology could be implemented in some of Samsung\u0026#39;s other phones as well. Although we don\u0026#39;t expect it to find its way to the brand\u0026#39;s older phones immediately, PandaFlashX shares that it could make its way to the Galaxy S25 series at the very least.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eSamsung\u0026#39;s done some pretty great things when it comes to implementing AI in its devices, debuting \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/circle-to-search-song-history-translation-access-easier/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCircle to Search\u003c/a\u003e, which has become one of the biggest features to come to Android devices in quite some time. For that reason, we have some big expectations when it comes to its upcoming AI tech that will be featured in its new foldable phones. Of course, we\u0026#39;ve seen some bad implementations of AI as well, with some feeling that \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/galaxy-ai-replaces-innovation/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGalaxy AI leaves more to be desired\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eLuckily, we won\u0026#39;t have to wait long to find out how Samsung will take its foldables and Galaxy AI to the next level.
