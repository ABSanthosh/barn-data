If you want, you can also upgrade to the 32GB version for $339.99, or the 64GB model for $364.99. The latter is also available in Metallic Jade. All models are available in Tungsten.Amazon Kindle ScribeAmazon Kindle ScribeE-reader with premium stylusE-readers are great for consuming books, an e-reader with a stylus becomes a powerful tool for classes or meetings. The Amazon Kindle Scribe 2024 is just that, a 10.2-inch anti-glare tablet with the Amazon Premium Pen stylus. Highlight your textbook, take notes, or just doodle for fun with up to 12 weeks of battery life.It seems a bit wild to spend this much on an e-reader. Even after today’s discount, this is an expensive specialized device. In fact, you can get pretty good regular tablets for about the same price, and you can do much more than read with those. Not only that, but there are some great E-Ink tablets available, and some of them run the Android OS. We know some of you take your reading seriously, though, and a high-end e-reader like this one may seem like a dream come true. Not to mention, having access to Amazon’s ecosystem is pretty convenient.The Kindle Scribe with redesigned display from 2024 brings the full experience. It has a large 10.2-inch display with a 300 ppi pixel density. One of the main upgrades with this version is that it has a flush front design, giving it a much sleeker form factor.Thanks to the auto-adjusting light, which has a maximum brightness of 94 nits, you can read in the dark. Battery life is also impressive, at up to 12 weeks per charge.C. Scott Brown / Android AuthorityYou’re not paying this much for the Amazon Kindle Scribe for those specs, though. It’s the extra features that differentiate it. It comes with a stylus, and the Scribe has notebook functionality. You can take notes as if it were a regular notebook, and AI tools come in handy. Additionally, you can write on books and documents.If you are really into reading and would like a notebook replacement, the Amazon Kindle Scribe with redesigned display has never been cheaper. This is still a record-low price, and the device isn’t on sale very often. This is the third time it has been discounted since its launch. Go get yours now, while you can!",
