  "text": "The Pixel 9 Memorial Day sale is one of those deals you just donâ€™t see every day. Right now, Amazonâ€™s slashing the price of the 256GB unlocked Pixel 9 down to $649. Thatâ€™s a full $250 off retail! Thatâ€™s not just a good price, itâ€™s the lowest weâ€™ve seen for the high-capacity model in months, and itâ€™s only available for Memorial Day. Seriously, if you want a phone that nails every flagship featureâ€”top-shelf camera, AI smarts, all-day battery, gorgeous 6.3-inch displayâ€”this is it. Youâ€™re getting features like Gemini AI baked right in. So, voice typing, photo magic, and live translation are just a swipe away. And this isnâ€™t some carrier-locked headache. Itâ€™s unlocked, ready for any SIM, with the pure Android experience that Pixel fans swear by. ðŸ›’ Donâ€™t sleep on this dealâ€”grab the Pixel 9 Memorial Day sale while it lasts.
