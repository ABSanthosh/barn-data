  "description": "The Google Pixel 4 is a fairly controversial phone. It’s got so much great going for it, but it also falls short in a few key areas. Our review calls it the “but” phone, because it has an amazing camera, but it lacks an ultrawide lens. It has remarkable performance, but the battery life is not great. It’s really good, but here’s a reason why it’s not so great. We have both reviewers of the phone - Kris Carlon and David Imel to talk about the Pixel 4 and the Pixel 4 XL!
