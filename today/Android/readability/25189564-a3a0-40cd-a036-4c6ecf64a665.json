Amidst all the ways that mobile carriers find to get you to pay more money, there are a lot of perks to be enjoyed if you pitch your tent with the right network. T-Mobile subscribers get plenty of bonuses through the T-Mobile Tuesdays scheme which has been going on for several years now. For the baseball fans in the building, today's Tuesday perk is bound to put a smile on your face. Ahead of the upcoming MLB season, T-Mobile is offering eligible subscribers the chance to get a free subscription to MLB.TV, lasting the entire season. However, the deal won't be available to claim for long. For a Week, T-Mobile Is Giving You the Chance to Claim a Free MLB.TV Subscription Image: T-Mobile If you're a massive fan of baseball, then you're probably really excited ahead of the season that will commence in a few days. The only problem you might have is that you're going to need to find a place to watch matches, and that will typically involve a subscription. That costs money, though it is unlikely to stop diehard MLB fans. But wouldn't it be great if you didn't need to worry about the financial impact? T-Mobile will take away that worry. Thanks to T-Mobile Tuesdays, eligible subscribers can claim an entire free season of MLB TV. We talked about it before, but the day is here. From today, March 25th, to March 31st, users will be able to snag a subscription if they're eligible. T-Mobile isn't too clear on who qualifies, but apparently, it includes a lot of people on T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, Home Internet, and Small Business plans. Image: T-Mobile You're going to have to claim this deal via the T-Life app, as expected, and you're definitely going to want to do that as soon as possible. This is a $149.99 subscription that we're talking about, so your pocket will thank you if you strike swiftly. T-Mobile Partners with the MLB to Deliver an Automated Ball Strike System The free MLB.TV offer isn't the only thing that T-Mobile and the MLB are shaking hands on, though. The carrier is in partnership with the league, using its 5G expertise to enable a new Automated Ball-Strike System (ABS) for games in the league this year. It's already been used in some of the spring training games, which have been on since February 21st. Image: MLB This is the first time that such a system will be used at the major league level. It has been tested in some minor league games in the last two years, so it has gotten plenty of testing. This makes it incredibly easy for the location of a pitch to be detected, in the event that it is hit outside the strike zone. That means a whole lot fewer arguments need to be had (though some might say that's part of the experience). T-Mobile's 5G network in the stadium will also be used for the MLB officials' laptops and for the tablets and other devices that MLB staff use to analyze the game. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
