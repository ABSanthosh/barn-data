It’s no flagship device judging by its hardware, but is rather aimed at budget-conscious buyers who want a capable device without spending too much. READ: AYANEO Makes its Android Tablet Debut Thanks to Qualcomm’s New Chip The The Honor Pad X9a packs an 11.5-inch LCD display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and is powered by the Snapdragon 685 chipset, coupled with a substantial 16GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. For software, the tablet runs on MagicOS 9 based on Android 15, so you’re getting a blend of Google-powered Android and AI apps, in addition to Honor’s own software features. A big (and we mean literally) highlight of the Pad X9a is its beefy 8,300 mAh battery, which supports 35W charging. This is wrapped in an aluminum unibody design, which does add a much-welcome premium feel. For photography, you’re getting an 8MP rear camera and a 5MP front-facing camera – a simple setup, but one that will come in handy for video calls and meetings, nonetheless. READ: The Honor Watch 5 Ultra looks amazing—but there’s a catch Honor adds that the Pad X9a supports other input methods including styluses and external keyboards, and even comes with software add-ons such as Google Kids mode, parental controls, and your usual suite of AI features from both Honor and Google.",
