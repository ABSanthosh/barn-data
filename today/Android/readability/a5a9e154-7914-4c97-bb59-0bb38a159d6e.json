I find myself in a unique position regarding my phone and physically protecting it. I love the feel of a naked phone and don't consider myself a klutz, so I occasionally forgo a case and I don't mind it. However, when my phone is case-less, I get a little peculiar about the surface I place it on—that glass back panel can get scratched. That's why the first time I used a dbrand skin, I realized I had found my niche. A skin lets you drastically change up the look of your smartphone while offering very basic protection, particularly against scratches. Dbrand has just launched its Circuit Board skin in collaboration with Linus, the tech YouTuber, and they look pretty awesome. Dbrand And LinusTechTip's Collaboration Is A Circuit Board Skin With A Colorway That Glows In The Dark Image: dbrand Smartphone skins are cool. They add only a negligible amount of bulk to your smartphone, offer basic protection against scratches, and provide a way to instantly change up the look of your smartphone—in ways manufacturers would never consider. This can make skins one of the quickest ways to make your smartphone look unique. I think most people would agree that dbrand is the most popular name in device skins. We've just gotten a brand-new skin from dbrand, and it's a collaboration with YouTuber Linus from LinusTechTips. The new drop revolves around printed circuit board (PCB) designs, with multiple colorways, one of which has a pretty big trick up its sleeve. Dbrand actually worked with PCB engineers to ensure that the components and schematic of the design were accurate, which is a lot more attention to detail than most would consider. It's also cool that using “three-dimensional UV printing”, the PCB components are printed in a way that makes them textured—so you can actually feel them on the skin. The Glow Circuit Colorway Uses Glow-In-The-Dark Vinyl; Comes With A Free UV Light To “Charge” It Image: brand The star of the new Circuit Board skin design has to be the Glow Circuit colorway. Sure, in the daytime, it won't be anything astounding, but in the dark or the nighttime, that's when it is bound to come out to play. It's made on “ultra high-performance photoluminescent vinyl”, so expect that glow-in-the-dark green that we all love. The coolest part is that dbrand will be shipping a free UV light with orders, giving you the power to charge up the pigment instantly. However, that freebie will only be available for as long as the supplies last. Short Circuit And Dark Circuit Are For Those Who Don't Want The Glowing Image: dbrand I think it is easy to understand that not everyone might want their phone lighting up like a beacon in the middle of the night. In such cases, you can go for the orange (with white accents) Short Circuit colorway. Image: dbrand If you like things even more muted than that, then the Dark Circuit colorway might be the right one for you. Everyone likes matte black after all, right? If you have a Google Pixel or a flagship Samsung device from the last several years, you'll be able to get the Circuit Board skin. Select OnePlus smartphones are also going to be in line. Dbrand's skins are also available for laptops and gaming consoles too. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
