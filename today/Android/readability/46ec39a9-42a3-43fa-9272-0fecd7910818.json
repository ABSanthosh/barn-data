Today we have the charts for October, with a bonus one at the end. The flagship smartphone chart shows the first entrants using the latest top of the line chipsets from both Qualcomm and MediaTek, and the former is clearly winning. The OnePlus 13 took the AnTuTu crown in October with an average score of 2,926,644, followed by the iQOO 13 with 2,906,489. Both of these are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC.

Today we have the charts for October, with a bonus one at the end. The flagship smartphone chart shows the first entrants using the latest top of the line chipsets from both Qualcomm and MediaTek, and the former is clearly winning. The OnePlus 13 took the AnTuTu crown in October with an average score of 2,926,644, followed by the iQOO 13 with 2,906,489. Both of these are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC. The first Dimensity 9400 phone is in third, the vivo X200 Pro, followed by the Oppo Find X8 Pro and Find X8, both also using MediaTek's latest and greatest. The sixth-place vivo X200 is part of team MediaTek too. Then we have the Xiaomi 15 in seventh, vivo X200 Pro mini, Xiaomi 15 Pro, and the iQOO Neo9S Pro+, which is the only device in the top ten to use last year's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC. Its average score of 2,097,853 is actually great for that chipset, but also a testament to how much performance has improved in the Snapdragon 8 Elite and Dimensity 9400 compared to their predecessors. The upper-midrange chart is ruled by the OnePlus Ace 3V (so for October OnePlus actually wins both contests) with its Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 SoC, followed by the Realme GT Neo6 SE using the same chip. Then we have the Redmi K70E with the Dimensity 8300-Ultra, the Realme GT Neo5 SE and Redmi Note 12 Turbo (both powered by the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 2), the iQOO Z8 and iQOO Neo7 SE (both featuring the Dimensity 8200), the original OnePlus Ace with its Dimensity 8100-Max, the Redmi Note 12T Pro (Dimensity 8200), and the Oppo K10 5G rounds up the top ten using the Dimensity 8100-Max. So it's a very interesting situation here - the top spots are dominated by Qualcomm, but MediaTek rules the bottom two thirds or so. But wait, there's more! Starting today, AnTuTu will also publish a monthly performance chart for Android tablets. The first winner is the Red Magic Nova, followed by the Oppo Pad 3 Pro, both using the overclocked version of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC. In third is the iQOO Pad2 Pro (Dimensity 9300+), followed by the vivo Pad3 Pro (Dimensity 9300), the OnePlus Pad Pro and the Lenovo Legion Y700 (2025) both with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the Xiaomi Pad 6S Pro 12.4 (Snapdragon 8 Gen 2), and finally we have the vivo Pad3, iQOO Pad2, and Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro, all using the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3.
