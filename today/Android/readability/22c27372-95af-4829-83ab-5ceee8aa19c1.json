See, on paper, the Honor Magic V5 in one specific colorway (called Ivory White) is advertised by the brand to be 8.8mm thick when folded. Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold7, on the other hand, is 8.9mm thick when folded. So there's a clear winner here, right? A clear \"world's thinnest book-style foldable', as it were. Well, not so fast.

Well, it's all about the pre-applied screen protector on the Magic V5, which is not part of the official thickness measurement, but is, well, pre-applied, when you buy the phone, whereas the Samsung doesn't have such a perk. This just goes to show how irrelevant a 0.1mm thickness difference is in real life, despite brands loving to claim things like \"world's thinnest\" and \"world's lightest\". So please keep this in mind - you won't feel 0.1mm and you won't feel 1g in real life, thus it only makes sense to make your choice for buying a device based on claims like \"world's thinnest\" and \"world's lightest\" if you then want to brag to your friends about your device wearing such a (sometimes very short-lived) crown. In this day and age, a lot of foldables are already thin enough and light enough to be very comfortable to use even when folded, so we'd advise you to make your pick based on other traits they have which you require. What do you think, though? Is all of this too much hype or are even minute differences like these important to you? Let us know in the comments.
