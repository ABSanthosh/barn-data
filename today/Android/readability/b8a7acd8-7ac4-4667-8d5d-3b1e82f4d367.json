It's great having internet on your phone when you're on the go, but it's even better having internet at home since that's probably where your network demands are the most intense. Whether you're streaming, downloading and playing games online, or making video calls, home internet is essentially necessary for the average person. The major carriers in the US offer home internet plans, but you might not be happy with the one that you're on, and that's exactly what T-Mobile plans to take advantage of. If you switch over to T-Mobile's home internet plan from another, the brand is ready to give you as much as $300 and even cover the other carrier's early termination charges. T-Mobile Is Giving Out Prepaid Cards If You Switch Over To Its Home Internet Image: Peter Holden/TalkAndroid T-Mobile wants you to know that they've got the best home internet offering on the market, and the carrier is ready to do everything it can to get you to switch over from those other carriers that it hopes aren't making you happy. If you're good where you are, then you should probably ignore this deal, but if you're actually looking for a new carrier, then this one is going to be perfect for you. For a limited amount of time, starting today, if you switch over to T-Mobile's All-In Internet plan, it will give you a virtual prepaid $300 Mastercard. Yep, free money, just like that. And if you choose the Amplified Internet plan instead, you'll get a virtual prepaid $200 Mastercard—it's less, but it is definitely nothing to scoff at. I think that's an offer that a lot of people should consider. There's no word on when this deal will end. Image: T-Mobile You won't get the Mastercards right away though, as they'll only be activated after you've been on the internet plan for at least 60 continuous days. Also, you need to keep in mind is that the All-In Internet plan will set you back by $70 every month, and Amplified will cost $60 per month. These plans come with a whole bunch of extra perks like a price lock guarantee, unlimited data, T-Mobile Tuesdays, and more. The Carrier Is Also Covering Up to $750 Worth of Early Termination Charges Switching from your previous carrier to a new one isn't always super straightforward. Sometimes, your contract isn't over yet, and that means that you will potentially have to pay early termination charges, and that's not something anyone wants to do for the sake of prepaid Mastercards. T-Mobile has already thought that far, though. Image: T-Mobile The company has committed to covering any early termination fees that you might be saddled with, up to a value of $750. That definitely removes one of the major hurdles for people who actually do want to switch over but don't want to deal with unnecessary charges. What that means is that T-Mobile wants you on its service so bad that it is willing to offer a total value of up to $1,050 to get you to switch over. It's definitely worth considering.
