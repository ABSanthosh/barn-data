Oppo is integrating Google’s advanced AI technologies into ColorOS 15. Soon, we'll see Google Gemini and Circle to Search in action on the latest version of the custom operating system. You'll be able to use AI to polish documents in seconds or summarize meeting recordings into clear notes.  The Gemini app will act as your personal AI assistant, and Circle to Search will help you find anything on your screen without leaving your current app. All these changes will all be available on the upcoming Find X8 series set to launch out-of-the-box with the OS. ColorOS 15 brings smart AI with a touch of Gemini ColorOS 15, which is based on Android 15, comes with its own smart assistant, Xiaobu, alongside Google’s AI features. Xiaobu provides continuous, content-aware assistance, meaning it can understand and respond to ongoing tasks or queries naturally. It can pop up on any screen to help with tasks, as it's deeply built into the system.  Image: Oppo It does seem more like Oppo is borrowing the concepts from Google's AI features, like Circle to Search and visual search, with their own version, “One Circle Question” and “Photo Q\u0026A”. But Xiaobu will complement Google’s Gemini and Circle to Search features to deliver Oppo’s in-house AI innovations and Google’s advanced capabilities. With ColorOS, our goal has always been to create an easy-to-use, harmonious, powerful experience through intelligence and collaboration. By incorporating Google Gemini 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash across language, assistance, and search, ColorOS 15 is turbo-charged by AI to boost productivity and creativity, exceeding customers’ needs like never before. Nicole Zhang, General Manager of AI Product, Oppo. AI features will also extend to image editing within Oppo’s Photos app, where you can remove people or reflections from images with a single tap, fix blurry portraits, and improve the resolution of low-quality pictures using smart upscaling. Live photos also get better stability with Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS), reducing shakiness for smoother and clearer results.  Anticipate AirDrop-like file sharing and more  ColorOS 15 also introduces several other new features, including an AirDrop-like file-sharing feature that mimics how Apple’s AirDrop works. Although there's not much information surrounding it, it's exciting as Apple’s seamless file-sharing system has set a high standard for how devices should quickly exchange files. Hopefully, we'll see something better than Quick Share. Image: Talk Android The international version of ColorOS 15 is expected to be very similar to the Chinese version, so all users should get the same features and design. The upcoming Oppo Find X8 series, featuring the new Dimensity 9400 chip, will be the first phone collection to come out with the OS. The OnePlus 13 follows closely with its own version, OxygenOS 15, with its release already completed in China. It's expected to come out in December or early in 2025. Image: Pete Lau on X The phones also mark the first time in two years since Oppo’s flagship Find series has been released in Europe since the Find X5. Both the Find X8 and Find X8 Pro will debut at the global event taking place in Indonesia on November 21, 2024.
