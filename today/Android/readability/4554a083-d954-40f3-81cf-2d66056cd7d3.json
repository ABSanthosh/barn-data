  "text": "Sign in to your XDA account It's easy to get wrapped up in the specs of a new PC build, so much so that you can lose sight of what's important -- your performance. One area that's especially true is memory speed, where faster DIMMs can represent a costly upgrade. Faster memory has its place, but if you aren't careful, you might spend extra money without any performance benefit. Related 5 Faster isn't always faster \"Slower\" RAM is sometimes faster, actually Wait, you're telling me that faster memory isn't actually faster? If you know a thing or two about memory speeds and timings, you already know where this is going. When you pick up a kit of \"fast\" memory, you're looking at the transfer rate, measured in MT/s but colloquially referred to by MHz. There's DDR4-3200, DDR5-4800, and DDR5-6000, and you'd assume that the highest speed equals the fastest memory, but that isn't always the case. The speed only determines part of the overall latency of the memory, so seemingly faster memory can actually have higher latency. Beyond the transfer rate, there's a string of numbers that accompany each kit of memory that represent the timings. For instance, you may see DDR5-6400 CS36-48-48-104. Here's what those numbers mean, in the order that they appear: CAS Latency (CL) -- The number of cycles it takes for data to be ready after a request. Row-to-Column Delay (tRCD) -- The number of cycles it takes to access a column of data after opening a row. Row Precharge Time (tRP) -- The number of cycles it takes to close a row of data and open another. Row Active Time (tRAS) -- Minimum time for a row to be active before data can be read. If that's all gibberish, don't worry. The main thing to pay attention to is the CAS Latency, which is almost always the first number when looking at timings. Depending on the CAS latency, memory with a higher transfer rate can actually have higher latency. For example, you'll commonly find DDR5-6000 memory with CL36. Faster DIMMs, such as DDR5-6400, can come with CL40. Doing the math, the DDR5-6400 has higher latency than the DDR5-6000, despite being \"faster\" on paper. In this situation, the higher transfer rate isn't enough to overcome the additional CAS latency. This really comes up when looking at two kits of memory that have a relatively close transfer rate, and it's a reason why there's a sweet spot for memory speed in each generation. For instance, you largely saw DDR4-3200 kits in the previous generation, and today, you largely see DDR5-6000. Faster DIMMs can make a difference, particularly with something like a DDR5-8000 kit with low CAS latency. But spending a few dollars more for a slightly higher transfer rate won't always net you a performance gain. And in fact, it can sometimes result in memory that's slightly slower overall. TeamGroup T-FORCE XTREEM ARGB DDR5-7200 Related Sure, your RAM speed does matter, but how much? Bigger numbers go faster, right? Well, when it comes to RAM specifications, it's not quite that simple. 4 Your CPU makes a massive difference You call a PC a \"system\" for a reason It's helpful to think of RAM as part of your CPU rather than a separate component. It's not literally part of your CPU, but your memory works to support the work your CPU is doing. Because of that, your CPU makes a huge difference when you buy faster memory. Some chips scale up well with faster memory, others see little benefit, and more still can see a drop-off in performance with memory that's too slow. These are usually minor differences, granted, but you should never buy faster memory without taking your CPU into consideration first. We're seeing that in action right now. For years, the traditional wisdom has been that AMD CPUs favor faster memory over Intel CPUs, but that's not the case anymore. Recent Zen 5 CPUs like the Ryzen 9 9950X3D don't see a huge benefit from faster memory, while Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K shows some large performance gains with DDR5-8000 versus DDR5-6000. This isn't just a battle between AMD and Intel, either. Different architectures respond to faster memory in different ways, and even CPUs within the same generation can see performance differences. You'll usually find that lower-end CPUs scale better with faster memory than flagships due to sporting less cache, for example. Intel Core Ultra 5 245K One of the most affordable Arrow Lake processors is the Intel Core Ultra 5 245K. Although it is an entry-level chip, it has 6 P-cores and 8 E-cores, making it a powerful CPU for both work and play. Related 4 reasons you don't need to upgrade to a DDR5 gaming PC yet Don't rush into upgrading your DDR4 gaming PC just yet. You can comfortably make it last for a few more years 3 Capacity is sometimes more important than speed Save some money with the slower memory, but get more of it Speed isn't everything, and that's especially true if you're spending up on fast memory while sacrificing capacity. If you plan on self-hosting applications or running VMs, for example, you probably want to favor capacity over speed. Sure, faster memory will help in these situations, too, but if you're on a fixed budget and have to choose between a faster, low-capacity kit or a slower, high-capacity kit, the latter might be the better option for you if you plan on running several applications on your PC at once, especially if they're self-hosted apps. Thankfully, this is an issue that largely solves itself. As capacity needs rise across apps like browsers and games, memory brands release higher-capacity kits and sideline lower-capacity options. With DDR4, for example, you'd find dozens (if not hundreds) of 2x8GB kits. Now, you'll find the bulk of kits in a 2x16GB configuration. Crucial Pro DDR5 64GB Kit (2x32GB) Related 2 Your resolution makes a big difference for games Think of your RAM as part of your CPU CS2 on a 4K monitor It's time to revisit the idea of thinking of your RAM as part of your CPU, particularly if you're a PC gamer. As we've established, your memory assists your CPU in the work it needs to do, so faster memory will play a bigger role in gaming performance if your CPU already plays a big role. You'll generally see a larger performance uplift at 1080p, for example, when your CPU is a larger factor in your overall gaming performance. On the other hand, you'll usually see a much smaller difference at 4K, where the bottleneck becomes your GPU. Especially in games, your CPU, memory, and GPU all work as a system, and the goal to get optimal gaming performance is to have your GPU be the bottleneck in your performance. This delicate balance doesn't just depend on your hardware, either; it also depends on what games you're playing. But, as a general rule of thumb, you don't need to invest in ultra-fast memory if you're playing at a higher resolution because your GPU is a much larger factor in your overall system performance. As a practical example, think of an APU. Fast memory almost directly translates to higher gaming performance with an APU because both the CPU and GPU share access to your system memory. If you have a standalone graphics card, however, it has its own pool of memory that's orders of magnitude faster than your system memory, so speedier RAM will play a less significant role in gaming performance. Related 7 things that could be causing your PC to bottleneck Nothing is more annoying than losing performance, especially when it can be avoided. Here are some things to check if you're having issues. 1 The performance improvements are sometimes invisible Temper your expectations When you upgrade your CPU, GPU, or even your SSD, it's easy to see the performance difference right away. Your PC boots up faster, or maybe you have faster frame rates in games. Maybe you're able to cut down on the export time in Premiere Pro, or the preview window in Blender is much smoother. Getting faster RAM doesn't always show a clear performance benefit, however. As an assistant to the actual computation happening on your system, the margins can be extremely thin with faster RAM depending on the applications you use. For instance, faster memory will usually speed up multitasking, but you might not notice the benefit. If you have 15 browser tabs open and opening another application takes 5 seconds instead of 7, that's not something that you'll notice in your day-to-day use. In a gaming context, faster RAM usually has an outsized performance benefit to the consistency of your frame rate and a smaller benefit to your average frame rate. You may not even notice the extra legwork your fast memory is putting in, even if it's technically improving your performance. That's not to say faster memory isn't inherently worth it, but you should keep your expectations in check. Other major components in your system have a direct impact on performance, while the performance benefit of faster memory is largely ancillary outside certain applications. Related 4 reasons your RAM speed matters With new hardware, RAM speeds are less necessary, but there are still a few cases where it matters. Faster memory isn't bad, but you might not need it I'm not saying faster memory isn't worth it, because it certainly can be. However, it probably won't revolutionize your PC's performance, and if you aren't careful with timings, you might end up spending extra money without any performance benefit whatsoever. The biggest takeaway here, however, is to think about your entire system in context. If you have a flagship CPU with a ton of cache like the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, and you're playing games at 4K, faster memory isn't going to do much for you. If you have something like a Core i5-12600K with a relatively small pool of cache, however, investing in some faster memory will provide a boost, even if it isn't universal across applications.",

actually faster? If you know a thing or two about memory speeds and timings, you already know where this is going. When you pick up a kit of \u0026#34;fast\u0026#34; memory, you\u0026#39;re looking at the transfer rate, measured in MT/s but colloquially referred to by MHz. There\u0026#39;s DDR4-3200, DDR5-4800, and DDR5-6000, and you\u0026#39;d assume that the highest speed equals the fastest memory, but that isn\u0026#39;t always the case. The speed only determines part of the overall latency of the memory, so seemingly faster memory can actually have higher latency. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the transfer rate, there\u0026#39;s a string of numbers that accompany each kit of memory that represent the timings. For instance, you may see DDR5-6400 CS36-48-48-104. Here\u0026#39;s what those numbers mean, in the order that they appear: \u003c/p\u003e        \u003cul\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003e\n                                        \u003cstrong\u003eCAS Latency (CL) \u003c/strong\u003e-- The number of cycles it takes for data to be ready after a request. \n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003e\n                                        \u003cstrong\u003eRow-to-Column Delay \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e(tRCD) \u003c/strong\u003e-- The number of cycles it takes to access a column of data after opening a row. \n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003e\n                                        \u003cstrong\u003eRow Precharge Time (tRP) \u003c/strong\u003e-- The number of cycles it takes to close a row of data and open another. \n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003e\n                                        \u003cstrong\u003eRow Active Time (tRAS) \u003c/strong\u003e-- Minimum time for a row to be active before data can be read. \n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n            \u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf that\u0026#39;s all gibberish, don\u0026#39;t worry. The main thing to pay attention to is the CAS Latency, which is almost always the first number when looking at timings. Depending on the CAS latency, memory with a higher transfer rate can actually have higher latency. For example, you\u0026#39;ll commonly find DDR5-6000 memory with CL36. Faster DIMMs, such as DDR5-6400, can come with CL40. Doing the math, the DDR5-6400 has higher latency than the DDR5-6000, despite being \u0026#34;faster\u0026#34; on paper. In this situation, the higher transfer rate isn\u0026#39;t enough to overcome the additional CAS latency. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThis really comes up when looking at two kits of memory that have a relatively close transfer rate, and it\u0026#39;s a reason why there\u0026#39;s a sweet spot for memory speed in each generation. For instance, you largely saw DDR4-3200 kits in the previous generation, and today, you largely see DDR5-6000. Faster DIMMs can make a difference, particularly with something like a DDR5-8000 kit with low CAS latency. But spending a few dollars more for a slightly higher transfer rate won\u0026#39;t always net you a performance gain. And in fact, it can sometimes result in memory that\u0026#39;s slightly slower overall. \u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                                \n        \n                            \n

It\u0026#39;s not literally part of your CPU, but your memory works to support the work your CPU is doing. Because of that, your CPU makes a huge difference when you buy faster memory. Some chips scale up well with faster memory, others see little benefit, and more still can see a drop-off in performance with memory that\u0026#39;s too slow. These are usually minor differences, granted, but you should never buy faster memory without taking your CPU into consideration first. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026#39;re seeing that in action right now. For years, the traditional wisdom has been that AMD CPUs favor faster memory over Intel CPUs, but that\u0026#39;s not the case anymore. Recent Zen 5 CPUs like the \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/amd-ryzen-9-9950x3d-review/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRyzen 9 9950X3D\u003c/a\u003e don\u0026#39;t see a huge benefit from faster memory, while \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/intel-core-ultra-9-285k-review/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIntel\u0026#39;s Core Ultra 9 285K\u003c/a\u003e shows some large performance gains with DDR5-8000 versus DDR5-6000. This isn\u0026#39;t just a battle between AMD and Intel, either. Different architectures respond to faster memory in different ways, and even CPUs within the same generation can see performance differences. You\u0026#39;ll usually find that lower-end CPUs scale better with faster memory than flagships due to sporting less cache, for example. \u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n

If you plan on self-hosting applications or running VMs, for example, you probably want to favor capacity over speed. Sure, faster memory will help in these situations, too, but if you\u0026#39;re on a fixed budget and have to choose between a faster, low-capacity kit or a slower, high-capacity kit, the latter might be the better option for you if you plan on running several applications on your PC at once, especially if they\u0026#39;re self-hosted apps. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, this is an issue that largely solves itself. As capacity needs rise across apps like browsers and games, memory brands release higher-capacity kits and sideline lower-capacity options. With DDR4, for example, you\u0026#39;d find dozens (if not hundreds) of 2x8GB kits. Now, you\u0026#39;ll find the bulk of kits in a 2x16GB configuration. \u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                                \n        \n                            \n

thinking of your RAM as part of your CPU, particularly if you\u0026#39;re a PC gamer. As we\u0026#39;ve established, your memory assists your CPU in the work it needs to do, so faster memory will play a bigger role in gaming performance if your CPU already plays a big role. You\u0026#39;ll generally see a larger performance uplift at 1080p, for example, when your CPU is a larger factor in your overall gaming performance. On the other hand, you\u0026#39;ll usually see a much smaller difference at 4K, where the bottleneck becomes your GPU. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eEspecially in games, your CPU, memory, and GPU all work as a system, and the goal to get optimal gaming performance is to have your GPU be the bottleneck in your performance. This delicate balance doesn\u0026#39;t just depend on your hardware, either; it also depends on what games you\u0026#39;re playing. But, as a general rule of thumb, you don\u0026#39;t need to invest in ultra-fast memory if you\u0026#39;re playing at a higher resolution because your GPU is a much larger factor in your overall system performance. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAs a practical example, think of an APU. Fast memory almost directly translates to higher gaming performance with an APU because both the CPU and GPU share access to your system memory. If you have a standalone graphics card, however, it has its own pool of memory that\u0026#39;s orders of magnitude faster than your system memory, so speedier RAM will play a less significant role in gaming performance. \u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n                                        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n

Your PC boots up faster, or maybe you have faster frame rates in games. Maybe you\u0026#39;re able to cut down on the export time in Premiere Pro, or the preview window in Blender is much smoother. Getting faster RAM doesn\u0026#39;t always show a clear performance benefit, however. As an assistant to the actual computation happening on your system, the margins can be extremely thin with faster RAM depending on the applications you use. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, faster memory will usually speed up multitasking, but you might not notice the benefit. If you have 15 browser tabs open and opening another application takes 5 seconds instead of 7, that\u0026#39;s not something that you\u0026#39;ll notice in your day-to-day use. In a gaming context, faster RAM usually has an outsized performance benefit to the consistency of your frame rate and a smaller benefit to your average frame rate. You may not even notice the extra legwork your fast memory is putting in, even if it\u0026#39;s technically improving your performance. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#39;s not to say faster memory isn\u0026#39;t inherently worth it, but you should keep your expectations in check. Other major components in your system have a direct impact on performance, while the performance benefit of faster memory is largely ancillary outside certain applications. \u003c/p\u003e

\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m not saying faster memory isn\u0026#39;t worth it, because it certainly can be. However, it probably won\u0026#39;t revolutionize your PC\u0026#39;s performance, and if you aren\u0026#39;t careful with timings, you might end up spending extra money without any performance benefit whatsoever.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe biggest takeaway here, however, is to think about your entire system in context. If you have a flagship CPU with a ton of cache like the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, and you\u0026#39;re playing games at 4K, faster memory isn\u0026#39;t going to do much for you. If you have something like a Core i5-12600K with a relatively small pool of cache, however, investing in some faster memory will provide a boost, even if it isn\u0026#39;t universal across applications. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
