You could also rely on video doorbells to see who’s at your door. But another way of protecting your home is by getting yourself a good and reliable smoke detector. This is because fires can start when you least expect it. It can happen because someone left the stove on and forgot about it. Or it can be caused by a faulty electrical appliance. Research shows that fifty years ago, it took 20 to 30 minutes for a house to be fully engulfed in flames in the event of a fire. Today, that time has been reduced to just 5 to 10 minutes due to changes in building materials and the widespread use of electrical appliances. According to the US Fire Administration, residents may have less than 2 minutes to escape once the smoke alarm sounds during a home fire. In preventing disaster and saving lives, every second counts. But what if residents had 15 seconds more?  The Siterwell A8612B model provides an alarm 15 seconds faster than the UL9 standard (based on tests conducted in Siterwell’s labs), giving everyone extra time to evacuate safely. Fast, life-saving alerts In case it wasn’t obvious, smoke detectors work when it detects smoke. But it isn’t as simple as that. Depending on the smoke detector brand and model, some can be more or less sensitive compared to others. Obviously the faster a smoke detector can detect smoke, the quicker it can sound the alarm and give you more time to call for help or get out of the house. With the Siterwell smoke detector, the company claims that it can actually alert users a good 15 seconds earlier compared to the UL9 standard. 15 seconds might not seem like a lot, but in some cases, it could be the difference between life or death or serious injury. In the event of a fire, every second counts, and being able to be alerted earlier means you have more time to evacuate yourself and your family to safety. The system also uses smart voice alerts in two languages (English and French). Having specific voice alerts gives you a better understanding of the situation so that you can take the appropriate action as quickly as possible. Below are a few examples of the smart voice alerts: Smoke alarm English: “Fire” Frenchz: “Incendie” High concentration smoke alarm English: “Too much smoke, cannot be silenced French: “Trop de fumée, mode silencieux impossible” CO alarm English: “Warning,carbon monoxide” French: “Attention! monoxyde de carbone” Smoke sensor failure English: “Smoke sensor error” French: “Erreur du capteur de fumée” CO sensor failure English: “CO sensor error” French: “Erreur du capteur de CO” Low false alarms We’re sure that many of us have found ourselves in the annoying situation where when you’re cooking, the smoke detector goes off. Nobody likes it when they’re busy rushing around the kitchen only to have to deal with the smoke detector just because it was too sensitive. That won’t be the case with Siterwell’s smoke detector. The company claims that their smoke detector can actually detect smoke precisely. This is thanks to the use of the latest maze core technology that relies on dual-wavelength light. This actually helps to accurately detect smoke from sources that are fast-burning and smoldering. It also uses mechanical creep simulation, mechanical impact simulation, air fluid dynamics simulation, and optical modeling. In short, this means that the Siterwell smoke detector will actually detect smoke from fires that are actually dangerous, not smoke from when you’re searing that steak on your cast iron pan, or the steam from your pots while you’re boiling something. High durability, low maintenance In the unfortunate event of a fire, things will burn and gadgets can melt. With the Siterwell smoke detector, it is made with high-grade flame retardant materials. For DC alarms, it uses US V0 flame retardant certified materials, while AC alarms are made using US 5VA flame retardant certified materials. It is made up to 2mm thick and during the course of a fire, can help protect the internal components which will allow the alarm to continue to sound to alert you of the fire. The Siterwell smoke detector isn’t just durable in terms of flame retardancy either. It is durable in the sense that it can last quite a long time. Alarms with limited battery life need frequent battery changes, increasing the cost of maintenance. In contrast, this 10-year battery alarm will offer long-lasting and worry-free protection for your home, and minimize battery waste for the environment. It also sports a micro-mesh design which helps to block things like insects and debris. You might not realize this, but sometimes insects and debris can have an impact on the accuracy of smoke detectors. By utilizing a dual-layer protection with a metal maze dust filter and insect guard, it helps to keep insects larger than 2mm out. It will come in handy if you’re placing the smoke detector in areas that might have a lot of debris flying around, like in a workshop, for example. Perfect for anywhere One of the more common places a fire can start would be in the kitchen. This is because there is usually a lot of heat generated in the area, like the stove, the oven, and so on. But this doesn’t mean that fires can’t start elsewhere. If you thought that the Siterwell smoke detector is only good for the kitchen, think again. The company has designed their smoke detectors to be perfect for pretty much anywhere. It can cover any area of the home where you want to cover. It has been extensively tested for a variety of climates. In addition to the kitchen, it can also be installed in the living room, bedroom, and hallway. However, it’s not recommended for basements or storage rooms. Adaptive CO Monitoring Frequent alarms for low, harmless CO levels can undermine users’ confidence in a CO alarm. The intelligent CO detection system in this alarm tailors its responses to varying CO levels by continuously monitoring low levels, and issuing timely alerts for high levels. Pricing This new combo detector is priced from $37.99, available with a 20% discount for a limited period now. Customers are invited to purchase directly from Siterwell’s official store or through Siterwell’s Amazon store. By choosing Siterwell’s latest innovations, protect your home and family with more than just dual coverage—but with a vital 15-second head start for greater security!
