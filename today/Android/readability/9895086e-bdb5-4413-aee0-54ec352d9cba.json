Here are the best smartphone, tablet and wearable deals from both. Smartphone The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is at its lowest price yet on Amazon yet, starting at $1,000 for the base 256GB model, the 512GB version is $1,120. Samsung.com offers a free storage update, but even with that the 512GB model is $1,300. That said, Samsung offers trade-in credit up to $630, so that’s something to consider if you have an old phone you want to get rid of. The new Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge also has a free storage upgrade and up to $630 trade-in credit. With no trade-in, the base price for the 512GB model is $1,100. Wouldn’t you be better off with an S25 Ultra? Check out our detailed S25 Edge vs. S25 Ultra comparison for more details. The rest of the S25 family, the Galaxy S25 and S25+, has a similar deal from Samsung.com – a free storage upgrade and up to $500/$530 trade-in credit. Samsung is gearing up to launch its next generation of foldables, which means that the old models have to go. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6 has a $400 discount if you’re not using a trade-in offer or up to $1,000 if you are. For example, a Z Fold5 is valued at exactly $1,000, a Z Fold4 or S24 Ultra will fetch $900 (if they are in good condition, of course). Tablets The flagship Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra has a $400 straight discount. Alternatively, the trade-in offer gets a smaller $200 discount plus up to $710 credit from sending in an old device. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ is available from both Amazon and Samsung. Amazon only offers a straight discount, while Samsung only offers a trade-in offer. There was no vanilla model this generation, so the smaller high-end tablet is the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9. Samsung also has mid-range slates, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE and Tab S10 FE+. These feature LCDs instead of OLED displays and the Exynos 1580 chipset (compared to Dimensity 9300+ for the Tab S10 series and Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for the Tab S9). Wearables The outdoorsy Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is available from Amazon at a lower base price and with a free 25W charger. However, if you want to trade-in an old device, you can potentially get a lower price from Samsung. Samsung also has the Galaxy Watch7 on offer – with slightly lower prices than Amazon had earlier this week. Amazon has adjusted its prices to match. The Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro have great sound quality, better ANC than before and the stems do make for easier controls. Alternatively, the Samsung Galaxy Buds FE are pretty cheap while still offering ANC (it’s just not on the level of the Buds3 Pro). These don’t have stems, but they have wings that keep them stable in the ear. We may get a commission from qualifying sales.",
