The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge was teased at the end of Samsung Unpacked exactly a week ago. It was nice to get a little glimpse into the device, as it disproved a lot of the earlier renders we had seen, and even the rumored name—S25 Slim might have still been a lot less confusing for a company that made “Edge” synonymous with curved displays. While there's a very strong idea of what the smartphone is going to look like, there's very little information regarding the hardware that's going to reside inside it. Well, a rumor has now landed, giving details on the camera setup, and it looks like Samsung might have neglected an S25 and S25+ camera upgrade to save the good stuff for the S25 Edge. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Might Come with an Impressive 200MP Camera Image: GSMArena The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge has had its physical design exposed in full, thanks to the hands-on session that the South Korean OEM held after the S25 launch event. Sure, it wasn't quite “hands-on” in a literal sense since the press wasn't allowed to handle the phone, but they did get to see it from all angles, and that's a lot more than the teaser at the end of Unpacked showed. Besides the design, tech enthusiasts are craving info on how the device will stack up on the spec sheet, and a new rumor from PandaFlashPro on X gives us some info on the cameras. The device will have only two cameras. One will be a 12MP ultrawide, just like we have on the Galaxy S25 and S25+. However, the main module is rumored to be a 200MP sensor, which could be identical to the unit in the S25 Ultra. Image: Samsung That should theoretically mean much better camera performance on this new model, and that's cool. The leaker did designate the rumor as coming from “Internal Prototype Information”, so there's a chance it could change before launch. However, if it does turn out true, it is quite frustrating that Samsung didn't think it pertinent to give its S25 and S25+ a hardware boost in the camera department. Returning to a Dual-Camera Setup for the S25 Edge Is an Interesting Move Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge It all seemed like the S25 Edge was going to adopt the same design as its siblings, but that's clearly not the case after its design was made public. It'll be the first Samsung flagship in a long time to come with less than three rear cameras (excluding the Z Flip phones). I think that's an interesting choice, especially as it is probably one Samsung didn't want to make. Image: GSMArena The third camera would have likely been a telephoto, and I believe the form factor of the new phone, with a heavy priority on thinness, made that a tough ask. I don't think that's a bad thing since it at least makes it almost unrecognizable as a Samsung device—the company has played it way too safe with designs in recent years, so I think this is a nice little touch. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
