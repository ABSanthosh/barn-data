  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Google Play Store purged nearly half its apps in the past year to enhance the platform. Android users are unlikely to complain about the removal of low-quality apps. Check out recommended apps to avoid clutter in the Google Play Store. The Google Play Store used to be celebrated. A place where budding developers could launch apps and tools without much intervention from the platform itself. And while this has spawned a variety of fun and useful creations over the years, there's a certain level of standard that is expected. But at some point, this point was lost, as the Play Store became overrun with ads and meaningless apps. Related Of course, Google has been working on improving on these problems, going as far as issuing warnings on low-quality apps. But it now appears that the platform has been taking some extreme measures, with new data showing that it has been purging apps from the platform over the past year, removing nearly half of the apps that used to be available. A welcome purge for many The news comes from the folks at TechCrunch, sharing data that was released by Appfigures. According to the news outlet, the Google Play Store hosted roughly 3.4 million apps at its height, and is now down to around 1.8 million apps, which is a drop of nearly 47%. As you can imagine, this is a huge drop, which could signify a new direction for Google and its app platform. For the most part, we don't think that any Android users will be complaining about the changes. As mentioned before, the platform has been suffering for quite some time with apps that just weren't up to par, so removing apps that were causing problems would only enhance the Play Store experience going forward. Of course, if you're still not interested in taking a look at the Google Play Store and want to cut through the clutter, we recommend checking out some of the best apps we recommend. This list features a variety of categories, and there's going to be something for everyone. So if you're trying to get your Android device to be at its peak, again, check out the list to get some of the best apps out.",

As mentioned before, the platform has been suffering for quite some time with apps that just weren\u0026#39;t up to par, so removing apps that were causing problems would only enhance the Play Store experience going forward. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, if you\u0026#39;re still not interested in taking a look at the Google Play Store and want to cut through the clutter, we recommend checking out some of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/best-android-apps/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebest apps we recommend\u003c/a\u003e.
