  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account After a pretty long wait, the Galaxy S25 Edge is finally hitting retail shelves this month, set to launch at retailers and wireless carriers on May 30. While we got a small tease of the phone back in January, we're now getting the full details, along with an avalanche of promotions centered around the device. Related With that said, AT\u0026T is going all out, offering a tempting discount on the phone that will make it available for free for those that sign up for service and trade in an older device. This promotion will be available through the AT\u0026T website, the myAT\u0026T app, and through physical stores as well. What makes this deal great? Perhaps what makes this deal even sweeter is that you can trade in any eligible phone, from any year, in any condition to get the discount. So if you have an old Motorola or Samsung phone lying around that you haven't used in ages, well, it's time to put that phone to good use and get the Galaxy S25 Edge for free. Of course, you will still need to sign a contract with AT\u0026T which will last 36 months. Furthermore, the carrier will issue a monthly credit during this time that will allow you to get the phone for free after the three-year term. This is pretty standard for how these promotions work, but it's worth noting that you will be locked into a contract in order for you to get this phone for free. When it comes to the phone, this is going to be one of the slimmest Samsung handsets we've seen to date, coming in at just 5.8mm. In addition, you get a large 6.7-inch AMOLED screen, along with excellent durability with a titanium frame and Corning's Gorilla Armor 2. There's also a 200MP main camera sensor, along with the usual software features that Samsung likes to pack into its phones. For the most part, not a bad deal if you're looking to trade in something. Again, the phone will be available for preorder over the next couple of weeks and will be available starting on May 30. This might be the phone to get if you're looking for something svelte, sleek, and powerful. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Samsung's latest smartphone combines the best elements of the mainline Galaxy S25 trio with an all new slim chassis. But will the smaller battery and reduced sensor count be enough to win over enthusiasts?",

Furthermore, the carrier will issue a monthly credit during this time that will allow you to get the phone for free after the three-year term. This is pretty standard for how these promotions work, but it\u0026#39;s worth noting that you will be locked into a contract in order for you to get this phone for free.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to the phone, this is going to be one of the slimmest Samsung handsets we\u0026#39;ve seen to date, coming in at just 5.8mm.

For the most part, not a bad deal if you\u0026#39;re looking to trade in something. Again, the phone will be available for preorder over the next couple of weeks and will be available starting on May 30.
