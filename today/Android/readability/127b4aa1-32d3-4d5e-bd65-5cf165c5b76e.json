  "description": "Oppo has been rumored to be working on the Find X8 Mini, to launch alongside the Find X8 Ultra and complement the already available Find X8 and Find X8 Pro in the brand's portfolio. Now it seems like OnePlus also wants a piece of the growing smaller-screen smartphone pie. So, according to a new rumor from Digital Chat Station, OnePlus will basically release its own interpretation of Oppo's Find X8 Mini.

Now it seems like OnePlus also wants a piece of the growing smaller-screen smartphone pie. So, according to a new rumor from Digital Chat Station, OnePlus will basically release its own interpretation of Oppo's Find X8 Mini. It will have the same 6.31-inch \"1.5K\" resolution LTPO OLED screen with narrow bezels on all sides, the same optical in-display fingerprint sensor, and the same metal frame and glass body. However, the OnePlus device will use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, whereas the Find X8 Mini is said to go with the MediaTek Dimensity 9400 instead. The OnePlus handset in question may be called 13T or 13 mini. It will have a 50 MP main camera using Sony's IMX906 sensor, an 8 MP ultrawide, and a 50 MP periscope telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. So the OnePlus interpretation will come with a different chipset and a different camera setup compared to the Find X8 Mini, but may otherwise be very close to the Oppo model. Digital Chat Station says this won't be a very affordable device, with its market positioning being quite high. We'd assume it would be priced at least at the level of the upcoming OnePlus 13R, but maybe even higher - though not as high as the OnePlus 13. Via",
