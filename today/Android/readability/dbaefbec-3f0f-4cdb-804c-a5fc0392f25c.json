With PC manufacturers once again making a return to the smartphone landscape, we’re also seeing smartphone brands trying their hand at making Windows hardware, as seen with the likes of the new Tecno MEGABOOK S14. READ: Phone Link for Windows update makes transferring files from Android easier Powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chip, the MEGABOOK S14 takes after a lot of other modern laptops, with a sleek chassis that Tecno says is made from “premium magnesium alloy.” It’s also light at 898 grams, and the 14-inch OLED display inside features a 2.8K resolution with a 120Hz refresh rate. Going back to the X Elite chip inside, the 12-core chip can run at either 3.4GHz with multiple cores in action, or up to 4.0GHz with just two cores. it’s also accompanied by an Adreno GPU that offers up to 3.8 TFLOPS of performance, and a Hexagon NPU can go up to 45 TOPS to run AI-based tasks and software. READ: Meet the Windows 365 Link, a Cloud-based Corporate Computer Alternatively, Tecno also offers a version of the laptops with Intel processors, specifically the Intel Core Ultra 5 and 7 series. There’s also Windows 11 onboard, in addition to AI software features baked into the software. Other specs include a 50Wh battery with 65W charging via USB-C, up to 512GB SSD configuration, and Nvidia hardware for graphics capabilities. Source: GSMArena",
