Samsung has released two new devices built for the frontline. The Galaxy XCover7 Pro and the Galaxy Tab Active5 Pro are for people who work in tough environments where the forces of nature are part of your job description. That is, if you're in construction sites, warehouses, or field operations where you're more prone to accidents than the average user. While there's ordinarily little appeal in carrying around rugged technology when users are screaming for lighter devices, Samsung’s products are packed with features that make sense in high-pressure, real-world environments. Samsung’s Galaxy Tab Active5 Pro has a replaceable battery  The Galaxy Tab Active5 Pro is a chunky tablet with a 10.1-inch screen and support for 600 nits of brightness. It runs on the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip and offers many AI-powered tools, including Circle to Search and Object Eraser. It has two memory configurations of 6GB + 128GB storage and 8GB + 256GB storage. The highlight of the device is a hot-swappable 10,100mAh battery that you can replace without rebooting the device.  If you're halfway through a long shift and the tablet's battery runs low, you can pop in another fully charged spare without closing your apps or forcing a restart. Of course, you do need to buy the extra battery separately. There’s also a No Battery Mode for setups where you might have the tablet plugged in for a long time.  Image: Samsung The included S Pen is also IP68 rated and can handle rain or grime. If you're familiar with Samsung's Ultra and foldable phone models, there's a lot here that will feel familiar and prove useful. On the back is a 50MP wide camera with an f/1.8 aperture paired with an 8MP ultra-wide sensor with an f/2.2 aperture. The selfie camera is 13MP. Related: Samsung Tab S10 FE Series Brings Premium Tablet Goodness for Less The XCover7 Pro may be Samsung's toughest phone yet The Galaxy XCover7 Pro is a smartphone with 6.6-inch 120Hz LCD display protected with Corning’s Gorilla Glass Victus material. It's also powered by the same Snapdragon processor and comes with a 4,350mAh replaceable battery.  It features a 12MP rear camera with an f/1.8 aperture and a flash. On the front, it has an 8MP camera with an f/2.0 aperture. Other features include stereo speakers with anti-feedback tech, customizable buttons for emergency alerts, and IP68-rating.  Image: Samsung It's even MIL-STD-810H certified, and can handle nature's elements on an extreme level. Although it's limited to 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, you can use microSD cards up to 2TB to compensate for the shortage. An April launch is set Both the Galaxy XCover7 Pro and the Galaxy Tab Active5 Pro will launch with Android 15. That's One UI 7 straight out of the box. Automatically, they join the expanded list of supported devices and cut out the torturous wait Samsung has put us through for the software. as well as support 5G, Wi-Fi 6E, and dual SIMs including eSIM. The tablet adds front-facing Near-Field Communication (NFC) where you can turn it into a mobile point-of-sale system or ID scanner. They’re also DeX-enabled if you care about testing Samsung's infamous desktop-like experience.
