Priced at around $180, what can you expect from these? Let’s take a look. READ: The New HD 505 Headphones are Sennheiser’s Take on Budget-friendly Audio One of the first things you’ll notice about the Edifier M60 speakers is their minimalist and compact design, which allows them to fit seamlessly into most desktop setups. We have the white version to try out, and we were pleasantly surprised to find that they include a pair of aluminum stands, allowing for a slight angled positioning. One thing to consider is that the speakers forgo physical buttons in favor of touch controls, contributing to a clean, high-tech aesthetic. It’s a design element which I personally like, although other users might still prefer physical buttons and knobs especially for situations where you might need to quickly adjust output volume or pause the music altogether. In front, you’ll find a 1-inch silk dome tweeter and a 3-inch aluminum mid-low driver. The back houses connection ports for AUX input, USB-C connectivity, the power cable, and the line connecting the two speakers. The speakers are also bundled with a 3.5mm-AUX cable, a USB Type-C cable, the speaker connection line, and a power cable. There’s also wireless audio via Bluetooth 5.3, providing flexibility, though wireless connections can introduce latency and impact sound clarity. Edifier markets the M60s’ high-quality audio processing, which includes a high-performance analog audio front end, support for SBC and LDAC codecs, as well as 24-bit and 96kHz operation. As a casual listener, I found the sound to be quite pleasing, with balanced bass, clear mids, and good highs.

Overall, the strength of the Edifier M60 speakers lies with their powerful sound and compact size, and I particularly appreciate the touch controls (again, a subjective matter), and straightforward connectivity via Bluetooth and USB-C.",
