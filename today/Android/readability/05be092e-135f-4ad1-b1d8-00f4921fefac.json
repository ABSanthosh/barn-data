The latest is the Unihertz Titan 2, which is up on Kickstarter for a crowdfunding campaign. Well, it’s more of a pre-order – the $100,000 goal was unrealistically low and it has already been surpassed over 8 times, anyway. The Titan 2 has a square 4.5” display with 1,440 x 1,440px resolution – just like the Passport.

The latest is the Unihertz Titan 2, which is up on Kickstarter for a crowdfunding campaign. Well, it’s more of a pre-order – the $100,000 goal was unrealistically low and it has already been surpassed over 8 times, anyway. The Titan 2 has a square 4.5” display with 1,440 x 1,440px resolution – just like the Passport. There’s actually a second display on the back too, a 2” 410 x 50px panel, although the utility of that is questionable beyond using it for main camera selfies. The star of the show is the 3-row QWERTY keyboard with a function row above that. It’s touch sensitive, so you can use it to scroll and to move the text cursor (including selecting text). The keyboard is backlit and supports multiple languages. You can also assign apps to be launched when long-pressing certain keys for instant access. The company worked with carriers around the world to make sure the Unihertz Titan 2 is supported – it’s in the process of getting approval from AT\u0026T, which will allow the phone to work on the AT\u0026T and Cricket networks. Do note that the US version is separate with support for additional bands. Supported carriersThis is a dual-SIM phone, by the way. It also has Wi-Fi 6 (ax), Bluetooth 5.4 and NFC connectivity, plus an IR blaster and an FM radio receiver (but no 3.5mm headphone jack). The new model launches with Android 15 and claims massive performance improvements over the original Titan, up 240% overall, according to Unihertz. The Dimensity 7300 chipset has a faster CPU (+202%) and the GPU (+341%). The chipset is paired with 12GB of RAM and 512GB storage. The Titan 2 is powered by a 5,050mAh battery with 33W charging. A full charge can be achieved in an hour and a half. All this while making the phone thinner (10.8mm) and lighter (235g) than its predecessor. The phone has a 50MP main camera on the back alongside an 8MP 3.4x telephoto module. The front camera has a 32MP sensor. The two early bird price tiers are sold out, but you can still grab an Unihertz Titan 2 with a 33% discount – that is $270 (MSRP is $400). The Kickstarter campaign has a few combos and bundles too. Shipping is expected to start in October 2025. Unihertz Titan 2 specsHere’s the promo video for the Unihertz Titan 2 – if you’re jealous of that leather cellphone holster, soon you will be able to get one too. It’s an add-on that will be available in the post-campaign survey period. Source",
