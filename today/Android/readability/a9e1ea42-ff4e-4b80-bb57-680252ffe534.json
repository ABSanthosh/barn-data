The SE model features just two differences from the standard model, a bundled Bluetooth adapter and colored highlights.

This device is meant to ease the process of pairing Bluetooth headphones with your PC or Mac for those who somehow can't figure it out and improve audio quality over the computer's built-in Bluetooth functionality. It supports aptX and aptX Adaptive and Sennheiser claims it's low enough latency to avoid lip-sync issues. An adapter is provided to plug the USB-A dongle into USB-C ports. And that's pretty much it. The Accentum Wireless SE are otherwise identical to standard model (aside from the copper-colored accents on the outside). This means they also work as normal Bluetooth headphones without the adapter. Sennheiser is selling the Accentum Wireless SE in India for INR 13,990. The BTD 600 dongle can also be purchased on its own for INR 5,990.",
