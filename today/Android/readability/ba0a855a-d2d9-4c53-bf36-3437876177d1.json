Have you ever dreamed of channeling your inner Wario and hearing nothing but coins as soon as you stretch? You can do that now. Or maybe you prefer the pew sounds from Splatoon waking you up? You could do that too! Do you yearn for applause as soon as you get your feet out of bed? A fan fair can play for you as soon as you do that. What a way to start your day! It’s not all fun and games though. Fancy hitting the snooze? Too busy jamming out to the tunes of your Alarmo while lying in bed? Well, the alarm gets more intense the longer you ignore it so you’re better off getting up as soon as you can! Not all fun and games It’s not just fun Nintendo sounds from your favourite games that you can look forward to. But thanks to the Alarmos’ movement tracking it can track your sleep, letting you know how well you have slept so you can start your day off right. When it comes to winding down at the end of the day you can use the Wind Down function to hear soft sounds to help you drift into sleep. You can also use the Alarmos hourly chime feature that signals the top of every hour! But what if you get tired of hearing the same old tunes? Don’t worry! Connecting your Alarmo to the internet will allow you to get updates to get more of your favorite games as they become available on the Alarmo. While we don’t have specifics on this yet, you can expect these updates as regularly as any other Nintendo update. Excited? Well, hold your horses. Right now, the Alarmo is only available at Nintendo.com, costs $99.99, and is only available for those with a paid Nintendo Switch Online Account. This means you need an active subscription to use this alarm clock. The price and a subscription are going to make this a hard sell for a lot of people.
