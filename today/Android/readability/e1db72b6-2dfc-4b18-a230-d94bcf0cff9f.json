  "text": "Perplexity has been gaining serious ground in the AI assistant and chatbot market. The tool offers real-time web search, citations for what it shares, deep research capabilities, alongside the option to switch between several different models for queries and image generation. Sonar, Claude 4.0 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and Gemini 2.5 Pro 06-05 are just some of the models that users can switch between for regular queries, while DALL-E 3, GPT Image 1, and FLUX.1 carry the image generation burden on the platform. Related Similarly to Gemini, Perplexity, too, offers paid and free tiers. The latter gives you access to your search history, unlimited basic searches, three Pro searches and Research uses per day, limited file uploads, and no access to advanced AI models, image generation, or premium support. The paid model ($20/mo), on the other hand, offers unlimited Pro searches, access to all advanced models, image generation, and access to exclusive support channels in addition to all the free perks. The company explains that the free plan is perfect for light users that are just exploring or need occasional answers. The paid plan is appropriate for users that want advanced AI, frequent research, file analysis, or image generation. If you've already given Perplexity a try, or would like to in the near future, you'd be glad to know that the AI assistant's Pro tier is currently free-to-claim for one-year for some users. Related This isn't the first time Perplexity has been found to be running a free Pro plan promotion. I spotted a promo for the Pro plan in the Uber Eats app (Canada) in September 2024. This time around, the scope of the promotion is even more focused, exclusively targeting Samsung Galaxy users in the US. This doesn't come as a major surprise, especially since the South Korean tech giant has reportedly been in talks with Perplexity to integrate the AI assistant into Galaxy devices. It's worth noting, though, that neither Perplexity nor Samsung have officially announced the free promo. It was spotted by Reddit user TheACwarriors five days ago, and we can confirm that it is still available to claim. The promotion is limited to users in the US, and seems to be available to all 'Galaxy' devices â€” even on mid-range A-series devices. Uninstall the Perplexity app if you already have it installed on your device. Head to the Samsung Galaxy Store and download a fresh version of the Perplexity app. Open the app and create a free account. If you already have a free account, simply log in. That's all. You should automatically be upgraded to Perplexity Pro. You should receive an email shortly after to confirm the upgrade. \"You've been upgraded to Perplexity Pro,\" will be the email's subject. The email's body says \"Welcome to Perplexity Pro, your gateway to limitless knowledge. We're excited to explore with you.\" Surprisingly, though, there's nothing about about Samsung and no explanation why users are getting the free upgrade. We're not complaining though.",
