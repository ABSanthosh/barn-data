  "text": "(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central) We may have officially entered the new year, but Mint Mobile has decided to extend 2024's best Google Pixel 9 deal a little while longer. Head to Mint's website right now and you can get a whopping $400 off the Pixel 9, plus 12 months of the popular Unlimited plan for just $180 (that's a 50% discount). In other words, you're looking at a full year of Android Central's favorite wireless plan AND a top-rated flagship phone for only $579 (or $25 if you pay using affirm). If this deal sounds familiar, it's because I've been mentioning it pretty much every chance I get. There is no other Google Pixel deal that came even close to matching this value in 2024, the only catch is that you have to be willing to switch wireless carriers to receive the savings. But seriously, look at your most recent phone bill then look at this deal — it probably doesn't even come close. Score 50% OFF Google's latest masterpiece at Mint MobileMint Mobile's Unlimited plan gives you unlimited talk, text, and data (capped at 40GB before speeds slow) on T-Mobile's historic 5G/4G LTE network. You also get free calls to Mexico and Canada and a mobile hotspot. There's no contract or confusing fine print to worry about, and you're free to leave Mint after the year is up with zero hassle. Even if you do decide to switch carriers at that time, the Pixel 9 is yours to keep. Speaking of which, as we detailed in our 4/5-star review, the Google Pixel 9 ranks among our favorite flagship phones released this year, coming complete with seven years of guaranteed software support, a ton of useful AI features, and some of the best cameras found on any Pixel to date. Just imagine: you can make a single payment right now and not think about your phone bill until 2026 — and that's not even considering the value of the Pixel 9. Yeah, it's that good.  Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android After almost a decade of working in the e-commerce space, Patrick Farmer (he/him) began his career at Android Central as a Deals and Commerce Writer before moving into a new role as AC's eCommerce Editor in 2023.
