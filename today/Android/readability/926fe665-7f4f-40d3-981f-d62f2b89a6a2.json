The Honor X60 series will bring a massive 6,600mAh battery It’s quite an increase from the main X50 trio from last year, the Honor X50, X50 GT and X50 Pro, all of which had 5,800mAh batteries with 35W charging. Now, Honor is yet to confirm the charge speed of the new series. And note that leaked hands-on photos of the Honor X60 detailed a phone with a 5,800mAh battery and 35W charging, just like its predecessor. This suggests that the 6,600mAh battery will be available only on the X60 Pro. The company did reveal more, but not about the power system. The Honor X60 series (or at least one phone in it) will support satellite communication. Also, the displays will use 3,840Hz high frequency PWM dimming. Honor X60 series teasers: Satellite communication • 3,840Hz high frequency PWM dimming We expect to see more teasers before the Honor X60 launch next week. And there might be more to it than just the phones too. Recently, the Honor X60 and an Honor Tablet GT Pro were spotted in official listings, so a new 12.3” tablet may be unveiled on Wednesday as well. Source (in Chinese)",
