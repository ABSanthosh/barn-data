  "text": "Valentine's Day is just around the corner, and you might be planning a nice date, a fancy meal, or you might just plan to spend it indoors with your partner. If you're opting for the latter option, you might be trying to think up ideas of how the tech you have can help you make it even better. With a NAS, there are a few things you can do to make it extra romantic! A walk down memory lane If you want to build a memories folder filled with pictures, videos, voice messages, and more, then you can work together to create one using a NAS. If you already use Nextcloud and don't want to keep this vault in the same place as your other files, you can deploy another NextCloud instance on another port that just the two of you can use. This can be a fun activity to do together, going back and looking at the history of your relationship and adding files together to build up a timeline of your relationship. If there are a lot of photos, you could even then turn them into a slideshow that you can show on a digital photo frame or stream to your TV! You could even pair it with PhotoPrism to make those images searchable. Cook something you both like If you like to cook with your partner and want to make something special for the day, you can use something like Mealie to collect recipes and come up with something special. Mealie is a great tool for tracking recipes and food, and even outside of Valentine's Day, it can be a great aid in your home when you want to make something but you aren't sure what. The beauty of Mealie is that it's so easy to use, and there are a ton of different apps out there that can make it even better. There are apps that will share webpages to your Mealie instance for processing and turning into recipes automatically, for example. You could look up some nice recipes, share them to Mealie, and then decide between the two of you which to make! 3 Build a playlist of your favorite songs A playlist between the two of you If you want to host your own music on a NAS, you can do that pretty easily. You can build a jukebox with a Raspberry Pi, for example, or you could do something a little more basic with something like Navidrome. It does require you to add your own music files, but Navidrome supports multiple audio formats and provides access to your music library from any device. This is great for songs that may not necessarily be on Spotify or they may be songs that you've got on your computer already. Think of it like a mixtape, except it's digital, stored in your NAS, and accessible from anywhere. 2 Make a Valentine's Day time capsule A fun way to spend an evening Like using Nextcloud for shared photos and videos, you can also create another Nextcloud instance or a restricted folder to act as a time capsule. This can contain anything you want to put in it, and you could commit to opening it in a year, two years, a special occasion, or anything else. Write some notes, record some messages, even film a video together to say to your future selves! This kind of project can be a lot of fun, and you can put literally anything in it. You're restricted to digital media specifically, but that means you can keep it safe and back it up in multiple places to ensure you never lose it. 1 Stream your own movies and TV shows For a chill night indoors If you want to watch a bunch of movies or TV shows together, your NAS can be perfect for that. With tools like Jellyfin or Plex, you can stream to pretty much any device. All you need to do is put your files on the NAS in an accessible way to the container, and you can stream it to a myriad of devices including a Chromecast. If you just want to have a chill Valentine's Day indoors, then this is one of the best and simplest options out there. With countless plugins available for Jellyfin too, you can customize the experience and really make it your own. Related",
