If you’re after the most affordable out of all the S25 models, then you might want to check out the base-model Galaxy S25, which is 20% cheaper right now with this deal. As for what you’re getting, the Samsung Galaxy S25 comes with the all-powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chip from Qualcomm, up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage, a triple camera setup, as well as a design that resembles the rest of Samsung’s smartphone lineup. The Galaxy S25 also features a 6.2-inch AMOLED screen and a 4,000 mAh battery. Note: this article may contain affiliate links that help support our authors and keep the Phandroid servers running.",
