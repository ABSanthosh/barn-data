It will also introduce its own image brand for the first time. This may as well be Oppo's Lumo, by the way. Thus, it's unclear what will happen with the Hasselblad co-branding, a staple of OnePlus flagships for the past few years. Either it continues and we'll have three brands on the back of the phone - OnePlus, Hasselblad, and the new OnePlus imaging brand - or it doesn't. That remains to be seen. In case the screen resolution downgrade made you think there will be a OnePlus 15 Pro as well, think again - the source of this leak claims that won't be the case, the 15 is all we're getting.
