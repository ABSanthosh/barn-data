For those who prioritize the software experience of a smartphone over every other aspect, the Google Pixel 9 smartphones were unarguably excellent. Generally speaking, it is hard to say that any OEM does software better than Google, though the company does have the advantage of having the tightest relationship with Android. For those who were big fans of the Google Pixel 9 series, the Google Pixel 10 series is coming soon, and thanks to the folks over at Android Headlines, we know the exact date that the phone will arrive. The best part is that it really isn't that far off. Let's talk about it. The Google Pixel 10 Family Will Land on the Scene in August Image: OnLeaks x Android Headlines The Google Pixel 9 series was made official on August 13th last year, shaking up the usual lineup. Last year, we saw a base model, a small Pro model, a big Pro model, and a foldable. There's no reason to think that the new system is going to change this year, so we expect to see the same four models show up. Thanks to the people over at Android Headlines, we know when the Pixel 10 family will be announced. Rather amusingly, the answer is that Google's next set of flagships will also be announced on August 13th. That'll put the launch on a Wednesday, as opposed to a Tuesday last year. We expect to see the next iteration of the Pixel Watch as well, though that aspect isn't confirmed by Android Headlines' source. Here's More Info on the Dates that Pre-orders Will Start and Arrive Image: OnLeaks x Android Headlines So, the Pixel 10 series is going to arrive on August 13th, during the Made in Google event, but when will you be able to pre-order the phone or buy it without pre-ordering? That's a good question, and thankfully, it is one that we also now have the answers to. Thankfully, you're not going to have to wait too long to get the device in your hands. DateGoogle Pixel 10 series announcedAugust 13thPre-orders commenceAugust 13thPre-ordered devices arriveAugust 20thGeneral availabilityAugust 20th That means there are only two dates that you really need to take note of. You'll be able to pre-order on August 13th, when the phones are announced, and just a week later, on August 20th, is the earliest that consumers will get their hands on the phone. Here's What We Know About the Google Pixel 10 So Far Image: Android Headlines Since we're already talking about the Pixel 10 series, it is a good time to talk about the things we know regarding the upcoming Google phones. There isn't too much that is confirmed at this point, but at least we know this much: With last year's model being the first set with the new design language, it is no surprise that no changes will be made to it this year. The Tensor G5 chips inside will switch from Samsung to TSMC for manufacturing, and could mean better thermals and efficiency. The base model will have Obsidian, Blue, Iris, and Limoncello colorways. Pro models (excluding Fold) will have Obsidian, Porcelain, Green, and Sterling options. A Google-made imaging chip could potentially mean better camera performance. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
