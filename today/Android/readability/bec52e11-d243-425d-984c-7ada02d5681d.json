  "text": "Lexar 1TB Professional Go Portable SSD $130 $200 Save $70 One of the sleekest portable SSDs you can buy, making it a great way to add storage to your mobile devices. The best part is that it comes with a hub for creators, and is now available for just $130 for a limited time. It's not easy to add storage to phones nowadays, as most top-end devices don't offer support for microSD cards. The good news is that cloud storage is a thing, and the USB-C port can also support a wide range of storage accessories as well. Now, it's never going to be convenient to have something sticking out of your phone while you're on the go, but if you have to, we think this Lexar SSD is going to be the best option. Not only are you getting 1TB of storage in a sleek package, but this bundle also includes a hub, which will allow you to connect more accessories to your device as well, while also having an additional USB-C port for power. This is great if you're doing something that requires the SSD to be constantly plugged in. The best part is that this SSD is not just for phones, and can be used with a variety of other devices as well. So if you've been looking for an easy way to add storage to your devices, this Lexar SSD is going to be it. While it's usually priced at $200, it can now be had at a pretty steep discount during Amazon's Prime Day sales event, which drops the price to just $130. This is the best discount we've seen for this device, so get it while you still can. What's great about the Lexar Professional Go Portable SSD? Source: Lexar This is a tiny portable SSD that measures in at roughly 1.71 inches by 2.71 inches, and weighs just 39 grams. The best part is, even though it's small, you're not sacrificing any performance, with the drive reaching speeds of up to 1,050MB/s. Now what takes this SSD to another level is that it also comes with a special hub, which allows you to plug it into a device, and still have USB-C connections available for other accessories and also power. While this might not be necessary on something like a laptop or desktop, it's plenty helpful on a single USB-C port device like a phone or tablet. This can be handy if you're using your device to record video, and need to record to an external source. Plus, the SSD is also quite durable, with an IP65 rating that protects it against dust and moisture. Overall, this is a very good portable SSD to own if you're looking for something compact, durable and versatile. Grab it for its best price from Amazon as it drops to just $130 for a very limited time.",
