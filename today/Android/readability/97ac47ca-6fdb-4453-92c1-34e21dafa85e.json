Nanoleaf brings music to your ears – or, well, light to your walls – as they announce a permanent price cut. It’s not every day a brand lowers costs when competition demands they push for more profit. But this one is taking a different route with its SmarterLife Pricing Initiative. After two years of optimizing its supply chain and manufacturing processes, the company now applies this decision across its Shapes, Lines, Elements, and Blocks light series.  Savings that light up your world  Nanoleaf is a smart lighting company that makes modular Light Emitting Diode (LED) panels you can arrange into different shapes and control from an app, voice assistants, or automation. Per their latest SmarterLife Pricing Initiative, products are now more affordable than ever.  The economic climate has made affordability a key concern for many consumers. At Nanoleaf, we believe that lighting should be an extraordinary everyday experience, not just a luxury. We’ve had to completely reoptimize our company structures as a whole the past two years, but with our team’s dedication and commitment to achieving this goal, we’re proud to introduce SmarterLife Pricing—making Nanoleaf products more accessible for everyone in our community. Nanoleaf’s CEO and co-founder, Gimmy Ch. Source: The Verge Image: Nanoleaf Starting now, the Elements Smarter Kit of seven light pieces now costs $199.99 instead of $249.99. The Shapes Triangle Smarter Kit of 13 pieces drops from $339.97 to $249.97. Bigger bundles see even steeper cuts, with the Invaders Bundle now $431.94 and the Immersion Bundle at $647.99. All products are currently available on the brand's official website. The changes may take time to reflect on Amazon and other retail sites. Art, ambience, and automation in one  Nanoleaf’s price cut couldn’t have come at a better time. Although their designs are some of the most visually striking on the market, they’ve also been pricey. Not everyone wants to drop hundreds of dollars on decorative lighting, no matter how cool it looks. Thankfully, the brand has come down to earth a bit. Image: Nanoleaf Their products have a modern, artistic, and customizable design in triangles, hexagons, and squares. They also appear in vibrant RGB colors, so that you can create dynamic lighting effects, sync with music, or match on-screen visuals if you want. Some models even have a woodgrain finish that's more natural than others.  You can control it all from the dedicated Nanoleaf App available on Android, iOS, and desktop. Think of it as the Google Home of illumination. It connects to your lights via Wi-Fi. You can also use the app to group multiple Nanoleaf products and set up automation schedules. Just set the time and they’ll dim or increase however you want them. Image: Nanoleaf If you're clueless on how to arrange your setup, Nanoleaf isn't short of inspiration. Their app’s Layout Assistant gives you previews and suggestions to help you own your space. The app also works with major smart home platforms, including Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and Samsung SmartThings. If touch control isn't your thing, you can always rely on your voice to manipulate the lights. Irene is an experienced writer with four years in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.
