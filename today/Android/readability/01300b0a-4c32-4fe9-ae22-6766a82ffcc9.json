They're also extremely lightweight, which means you can wear them for hours, and they also work extremely well for workouts and runs.

earbuds, they wrap around your ears, offering a tight fit that\u0026#39;s also quite comfortable. They\u0026#39;re also extremely lightweight, which means you can wear them for hours, and they also work extremely well for workouts and runs. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the most important thing, though, is that you\u0026#39;re getting elite protection with an IPX7 rating that protects against water and sweat. And, of course, you also get pretty good sound too, which means you can easily enjoy all your favorite music. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, you\u0026#39;ll want to be aware of your surroundings when you have these on, and Anker provides a simple solution thanks to its open-ear design. Call quality is also quite good here with four microphones to keep your voice clarity at its peak during calls. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to battery life, you\u0026#39;re looking at around 11 hours of use on a single charge, and up to 42 hours more from the included charging case. A quick 10-minute top-up will get four hours of use just in case you forgot to charge the night before. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eYou also get multipoint connectivity, which makes it easy to swap from one device to another without having to pair and repair. Overall, these earbuds are the ones to go with if you need something that can stay in your ears during challenging moments.
