In the US mobile carrier space, things are going to start getting a little tougher for the biggest corporations. Growth this quarter is expected to drop 12% compared to last year, possibly indicating a shrinking customer base for these carriers to make sales in. They'll need to work hard to entice prospects to come over to them instead of competitors. T-Mobile is ready to take up that opportunity and show you exactly how much it can deliver to make sure that you choose it over the others, introducing two new plans. Plus, in addition to that, T-Mobile's sub-brand Metro will be bringing four new plans. There's a lot to talk about, so let's get into it. T-Mobile Introduces the New Experience More and Experience Beyond Mobile Plans Image: T-Mobile The economic climate might already be tough for someone, but it might get a little tougher as inflation has been climbing since 2020, and newly introduced tariffs are bound to lead to price increases across a number of industries. With things bound to get a little tougher, it's not a bad thing to search out value where you can get it. It seems that T-Mobile gets that, so it has just introduced two new mobile plans. The carrier has introduced two new plans, Experience More and Experience Beyond, which will both be available starting tomorrow, April 23rd. The question is, what do they bring to the table that current plans don't? Let's break that down: Experience More is based on Go5G Plus and comes with all of its benefits, but adds a little extra: More hotspot data, though the exact number isn't clear T-Satellite with Starlink included through to the end of the year Costs $5 less per line Experience Beyond is based on Go5G Next and comes with all of its benefits, but just like the other plan, it adds some more on top: Higher data allowance, though no exact number yet T-Satellite included as well Image: T-Mobile Also, it's a major perk that both plans will come with a 5-year price guarantee, so the prices you get now in 2025 will be the exact same ones you'll be paying in 2030. Metro by T-Mobile Launches Four New Plans for More Choices Image: T-Mobile At the same time, you'll be able to enjoy new plans if you're a Metro subscriber. The T-Mobile sub-brand is bringing Metro Starter, Metro Starter Plus, Metro Flex Unlimited, and the mouthful that is Metro Flex Unlimited Plus. Each of these plans also comes with a 5-year price guarantee, but besides that, what else do you get? Metro Starter: With this plan, prices drop as low as $25 per line for a family of four with AutoPay enabled. Plus, a 5G phone for each member of the family is a nice bonus. Metro Starter Plus: On this plan, Metro's $40 PERIOD plan comes back, letting you bring a number over, get a new phone, and enjoy unlimited talk, text, and 5G data for $40. On Metro Starter Plus, you can get unlimited 5G on two lines and two Samsung Galaxy A15s for $65 a month. Metro says that's the cheapest deal in prepaid plans. Metro Flex Unlimited: With four people and AutoPay, prices drop to $30 per line, and with that, you get unlimited talk, text, and data. Plus, you can get a new phone from the first day. Plus, with any Flex plan, you get the perk of annual device upgrades. Metro Flex Unlimited Plus: On this, you get extra perks on top of Metro Flex Unlimited, including Amazon Prime for free and the ability to connect a smartwatch or tablet for just an extra $5 every month.
