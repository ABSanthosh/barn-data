  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Google is simplifying how users share excerpts of text from Gemini responses in the Google app, moving towards a more intuitive drag-and-select method. Currently, sharing a portion of a Gemini reply involves a four-step process, which the update aims to streamline significantly. The new implementation has a limitation: it doesn't currently allow seamless selection of text across bulleted or numbered lists, though this may be addressed before the public release. Google's Gemini is getting smarter with every passing month. What started out as Bard in 2023 has rapidly evolved into a capable AI model, powered by dedicated models for all-around help, deep research, and even reasoning, math, and code. Even though the assistant can do a lot more than answer simple queries — it can generate videos, connect with frequently-used apps, see what's on your screen, and more, text-based answers to queries remain a core aspect of the AI tool's functionality. Related Recognizing the importance, Google now seems to be taking steps to make text-based answers easier to share. Sharing Gemini replies is a seamless process, but only when you want to share the response in its entirety. You simply long tap the text and tap Copy text in the subsequent overflow menu. You're then free to paste the reply wherever needed. Alternatively, you also have the option to Export to Docs, or share the conversation via a public link. However, if you only want to copy and share an excerpt from the reply, you have to go through a four-step process. Long tap the text (or tap the three-dot icon). Tap Select text. Select the text in a new page. Share and/or Copy. The image above highlights what the current excerpt-sharing procedure looks like. However, Google seems to be planning a change to make excerpt-sharing a lot more intuitive and seamless. As highlighted by folks over at Andorid Authority after looking into a new Google app beta build (version 16.20.48.sa.arm64 beta), copying Gemini's reply to your query could soon be as simple as copying text from a webpage. If and when the simplification goes live, users will be able to long press text and begin dragging their finger to highlight text, with the familiar Copy and Share chips appearing as soon as you stop dragging your finger. For what it's worth, the new implementation, although much more intuitive, still has one flaw. The drag-and-select gesture can not continue highlighting text if it encounters a list and bullet points. The limitation could very well be fixed by the time Google is ready to roll out the intuitive sharing feature. When that happens, though, is currently unclear.",
