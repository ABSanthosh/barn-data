  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Pebble is making a comeback with Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 smartwatches. Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky chose to share new details about the progress with a new video. It appears there's still a lot of work to be done, but the first watch is set to release in July. There are a ton of smartwatches already on the market right now. So it came as a bit of a surprise when it was announced that Pebble would be coming back, in the form of two new devices, the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2. While the original idea for these smartwatches was pretty good when they were first released back in 2013, they are, to be frank, quite dated by today's standards. Related Despite this, the reception has been quite positive, with many people voicing that they want devices that are much simpler. With the Core 2 Duo set to make its retail debut in July, it's just a matter of months before folks will have a brand-new Pebble wrapped around their wrists. If you're a Pebble fan, this is a must watch However, there's still a lot of work to be done, and Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky has shared new details in a video showcasing the watch, while also answering some important questions as well. Migicovsky has been pretty transparent about the build process from the jump, sharing insights about the process of building a new Pebble watch on his own blog. And while reading these updates has been great, being able to see and hear these updates is going to be even better. Now, this isn't some high-level production, so you'll want to temper your expectations. But it gets the information across, and should provide anyone interested in Pebble with a new way to intake information. What comes as a bit of a surprise and what was shown in the video is that PebbleOS isn't completely working on the new watch yet. For the most part, it looks like things are pretty barebones for now, with a majority of the functions of the watch not being operational. However, you do get to see the watch in action with Migicovsky loading up a variety of watch faces, and there's also the new charging dongle, which will be able to connect to a standard USB-C plug. Migicovsky also discusses how tariffs will affect orders coming into the US, potentially adding $10 to $20 on top of the original retail price. Those in other parts of the world won't see this, but each country could charge its own VAT, so that's just something to be aware of. As far as the software, it doesn't look like all that much will be added when the device launches. Migicovsky seems fairly content with how Pebble works and worked on his wrist over the past decade, but did share that widgets is something that would be nice to have. He also wished that there would be some Beeper integration, and highlighted some other improvements he'd like to see. Surely this will all come along as more and more Pebble watches get into the hands of new consumers. PebbleOS is now open source, which means that anyone can take a swing at making it better. So things could progress fairly quickly if enough developers get on board and dedicate enough time to making the OS better than it was. For the most part, it's good to see this type of progress on the device out in the open. If you're a Pebble fan, it's probably a good idea to subscribe to get the latest news.",

href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/pebble-watch-rebirth/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethey want devices that are much simpler\u003c/a\u003e. With the Core 2 Duo set to make its retail debut in July, it\u0026#39;s just a matter of months before folks will have a brand-new Pebble wrapped around their wrists. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"if-you-39-re-a-pebble-fan-this-is-a-must-watch\"\u003e\n                        If you\u0026#39;re a Pebble fan, this is a must watch\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there\u0026#39;s still a lot of work to be done, and Pebble founder \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/UCI7N70tNRE?si=UmR8KGIWaBFVkoFE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEric Migicovsky has shared new details in a video\u003c/a\u003e showcasing the watch, while also answering some important questions as well. Migicovsky has been pretty transparent about the build process from the jump, sharing insights about the process of building a new Pebble watch on his \u003ca href=\"https://ericmigi.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eown blog\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAnd while reading these updates has been great, being able to see and hear these updates is going to be even better. Now, this isn\u0026#39;t some high-level production, so you\u0026#39;ll want to temper your expectations. But it gets the information across, and should provide anyone interested in Pebble with a new way to intake information.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhat comes as a bit of a surprise and what was shown in the video is that PebbleOS isn\u0026#39;t completely working on the new watch yet. For the most part, it looks like things are pretty barebones for now, with a majority of the functions of the watch not being operational.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, you do get to see the watch in action with Migicovsky loading up a variety of watch faces, and there\u0026#39;s also the new charging dongle, which will be able to connect to a standard USB-C plug. Migicovsky also discusses how tariffs will affect orders coming into the US, potentially adding $10 to $20 on top of the original retail price.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThose in other parts of the world won\u0026#39;t see this, but each country could charge its own VAT, so that\u0026#39;s just something to be aware of. As far as the software, it doesn\u0026#39;t look like all that much will be added when the device launches. Migicovsky seems fairly content with how Pebble works and worked on his wrist over the past decade, but did share that widgets is something that would be nice to have.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eHe also wished that there would be some Beeper integration, and highlighted some other improvements he\u0026#39;d like to see. Surely this will all come along as more and more Pebble watches get into the hands of new consumers. \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/new-pebble-smartwatch-google-releases-source-code/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePebbleOS is now open source\u003c/a\u003e, which means that anyone can take a swing at making it better.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSo things could progress fairly quickly if enough developers get on board and dedicate enough time to making the OS better than it was. For the most part, it\u0026#39;s good to see this type of progress on the device out in the open. If you\u0026#39;re a Pebble fan, it\u0026#39;s probably a good idea to subscribe to get the latest news. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
