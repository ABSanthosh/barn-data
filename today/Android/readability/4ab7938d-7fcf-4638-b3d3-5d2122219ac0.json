It’s been years since we’ve brought up Keeper (a password manager app), but this week they announced big changes for its Wear OS and Android app. For Wear OS users, the app is getting a makeover, one that has a “fresh, modern UI.” This redesign will result in improved usability and navigation, which all sounds good. In addition to just looks, Keeper details instant access to credentials and 2FA codes on your watch, as well as the ability to quickly access your most-used logins without the need for your phone. The app is also getting some love. Keeper details a simplified account setup process, an enhanced Offline Mode, as well as a decoupling of Offline Mode and 2FA for better management of your security. Check out the full list of details below. Key features of the updated Keeper WearOS app for Android: Redesigned Interface: A fresh, modern UI improves usability and navigation, featuring a rotating carousel on the vault page with dynamic content and key security insights at a glance. Instant Access to Credentials and 2FA Codes: View and retrieve passwords and authentication codes with a tap. Watch Favorites: Quickly access your most-used logins without reaching for your phone. The release also includes offline functionality for the Keeper Android app: Simplified Account Setup: A streamlined onboarding process makes it easy to create an account and import passwords in just a few steps. Enhanced Offline Mode: Now with improved controls, users can configure vault access for one, seven or 30 days, making security more flexible for travel and remote work. Enterprise users receive explicit alerts when offline access is restricted based on company policies. Decoupled Offline Mode and 2FA: Manage offline access and 2FA settings separately for more control over security preferences. You can snag the update by following the link below.
