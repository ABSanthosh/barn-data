If you've never dabbled in overclocking your CPU, there are enough reasons to consider it. Besides the performance benefits, overclocking your CPU can extend the relevance of your aging hardware, and can also be an interesting side project for some users. Related Overclocking vs undervolting: Which one do you prefer? Overclocking is one of the most common ways to extract some more performance out of your CPU, though it does have some inherent risks. Pushing your CPU's clock speed past the normal level will require you to increase the core voltage, which, in turn, will make your processor more toasty. If your system lacks adequate cooling provisions, overclocking could reduce your processor's lifespan.Meanwhile, undervolting is the act of lowering the amount of the voltage supplied to the processor. While this may sound detrimental to performance, undervolting can help you mitigate the issue of thermal throttling. Heck, thermally-challenged systems might even see a boost in the FPS after a successful undervolt.Personally, I'm a part of the overclocking faction, though I use Auto OC inside the BIOS to avoid spending hours fine-tuning the clock frequency and voltage. But what about you? Are you a fan of overclocking, or do you prefer the superior thermals provided by a stable 5 Improved gaming performance in some titles Some games benefit more than others Better gaming performance is a big motivator for overclockers. Despite the fact that any gains on most modern processors are minimal, enthusiasts and casual users alike are always enticed by the prospect of pushing a CPU to its limits. Overclocking, in general, can increase not only your average FPS, but also the 1% and 0.1% lows, resulting in smoother gameplay, maybe even helping you jump from sub-60 FPS to 60+ FPS. Depending on the kind of game you are playing, a small overclock can also result in disproportionate gains. Some games are more CPU-bound than others, especially at 1080p. Take, for example, RTS games or simulation games like Sid Meier's Civilization series, Cities: Skylines series, or even single-player games like Cyberpunk 2077. Any game which needs to render a large number of NPCs, objects, or other elements needs healthy CPU horsepower. Overclocking your CPU, in such cases, can often lead to more than minimal performance improvement, which makes the process worth a shot. Of course, your mileage may vary depending on your CPU model and the silicon lottery. However, almost every user can achieve a stable overclock with some trial and error. Plus, there are enough and more overclocking guides available on the internet. As long as you are careful with dialing in your frequency and voltage settings, you should be able to safely extract some extra gaming performance out of your CPU. Related How to overclock your GPU: A beginner's guide Overclocking has been going out of style recently, but it's still a good way to get some extra performance out of your GPU. Here's how you do it. 4 Faster productivity performance in many applications Supercharge those all-core workloads Outside a few genres, overclocking for gaming is not game-changing (pun not intended), especially considering the factory performance of modern Intel and AMD processors. However, the same is not true for productivity workloads like photo editing, video editing, rendering, and 3D simulation. If you are majorly running these workloads, CPU overclocking can actually net you significant gains in programs like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, Blender, and others. Unlike games, where performance is often GPU-bound, productivity applications can make better use of enhanced CPU performance. Multi-core workloads can make full use of a successful all-core overclock, helping you save time and increase efficiency. Although more cores are always preferred for productivity applications, you can try to maximize the performance of your existing CPU. That said, if your computer is part of your professional setup, you might be comfortable spending more on a CPU with more cores instead of overclocking one with fewer cores. This is because even if you get a highly overclockable CPU, the time and effort spent to achieve a worthwhile overclock might be better spent on your work, then simply get a more expensive but more powerful processor. Gamers don't always need high-end CPUs to get a premium gaming experience, but professionals need all the CPU horsepower they can get. Hence, the importance of buying \"more CPU\" makes sense for the latter kind of user. Related How to make your CPU perform better Is your CPU not performing at its best? Here are some fixes you should try out. 3 Simple overclocking methods are accessible to everyone Precision Boost Overdrive and Intel Performance Maximizer Despite the promise of extra performance, overclocking is not for everyone. It requires patience, know-how, and the ability to deal with stability issues without panicking. Automatic overclocking mechanisms, however, make overclocking more accessible to a larger number of users. For instance, AMD's PBO can tweak your processor's power and current settings to grant you a one-click performance boost on your Ryzen CPU. You don't need to mess with BIOS settings as you can use Ryzen Master to enable PBO within the Windows environment. The gains you get from PBO might not be as great in gaming as they are in productivity apps, but it's a quicker and easier method to get those extra percentage points of performance from your CPU. Intel Performance Maximizer works similarly on Intel CPUs by finding the maximum overclock possible on your chip and applying them like a one-click auto tuner. It isn't as dynamic as AMD's PBO, as it doesn't adjust the overclock based on the thermal and power conditions, but is still helpful for beginners. Modern Intel and AMD processors already have other automated boost mechanisms like AMD's Precision Boost and Intel's Turbo Boost that work in the background without user input, but features like PBO and Intel Performance Maximizer can offer more control and performance to users who are willing to experiment a bit more with their chip. Related How to use AMD Ryzen Master Ryzen Master allows easy, BIOS-free overclocking for your Ryzen CPUs. Here's a complete rundown of everything you can do with it. 2 Delaying a CPU upgrade by pushing your existing CPU Get more life out of your old CPU The latest AMD and Intel CPUs might already run close to their performance limits out of the factory, but previous-gen products used to yield significant gains from overclocking. It was, in fact, common advice to buy a chip one tier below than what you really needed and overclock it to achieve the performance level of the next-tier model. Buying the Ryzen 5 5600 instead of the Ryzen 5 5600X, or the Ryzen 7 7700 instead of the Ryzen 7 7700X is still a worthy trade-off. So, if you are rocking an older CPU and don't want to upgrade your system right now, you should definitely give overclocking a shot. You might be able to get a few more FPS or shave a few seconds off of your rendering time, allowing your setup to stay relevant till the next CPU generation, at least. Most users don't upgrade their CPU as often as their graphics card or other components, so you might already have a pretty old chip ready to be overclocked. A majority of gamers still use 1080p as their primary resolution. This group of users can benefit the most from a CPU overclock, especially if playing more CPU-dependent titles. If you are a budget user and don't want to upgrade as often as others, overclocking your existing processor can help you maximize the value of your setup over the course of its lifecycle.

Hold your horses, as overclocking your DDR4 RAM might save you money and get you what you need. 1 Overclocking can be an exciting DIY project Learn a few new tricks Lastly, overclocking can be a fun hobby to sink your time into. If you are bored with your Steam library and don't have anything else on your radar, you can try messing around with your CPU to test your DIY skills. Overclocking requires curiosity, hit and trial, and initiative from every user, so it's bound to be an enriching experience. Overclocking isn't a rigid science, since every user needs to discover the optimal settings for their chip themselves. So if you are a beginner, that's no reason to skip overclocking completely. Based on reliable tutorials from reputed publications and fellow users on Reddit, you can always start with a minimal overclock that doesn't hamper your system stability. Once you are confident enough, you can proceed to the next level, push your CPU further, and see how far you can take it. Of course, you need a capable cooling setup to handle the increased heat output from your processor, but as long as you don't go reckless, you can safely push your CPU and gain valuable experience along the way. Related Grant a second life to your old PC with these 8 fun projects If you have an outdated PC that's gathering dust, now's the time to put it to good use To overclock or not to overclock, that is the question Overclocking might not be as relevant as it used to be, but it still promises extra performance from your hardware that would otherwise be left untapped. Of course, deciding whether the thermal and power trade-off is worth it is on you. Overclocking your CPU needs some time, effort, and patience, and the results might not seem worthwhile, depending on what you're running. However, I recommend everyone to try CPU overclocking at least once. If nothing else, it'll familiarize you with your processor, a few overclocking and monitoring programs, and open you up to new computing experiences.

Hence, the importance of buying \u0026#34;more CPU\u0026#34; makes sense for the latter kind of user.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv data-include-community-rating=\"false\" id=\"0d2f-4b60-9ca80cbde378\" data-nosnippet=\"\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-make-your-cpu-perform-better/\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/amd-ryzen-7-7700-cpu-next-to-its-cooler.jpg\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/amd-ryzen-7-7700-cpu-next-to-its-cooler.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=422\u0026amp;h=268\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/amd-ryzen-7-7700-cpu-next-to-its-cooler.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=422\u0026amp;h=268\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/amd-ryzen-7-7700-cpu-next-to-its-cooler.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=310\u0026amp;h=220\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/amd-ryzen-7-7700-cpu-next-to-its-cooler.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=310\u0026amp;h=220\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/amd-ryzen-7-7700-cpu-next-to-its-cooler.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=720\u0026amp;h=400\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/amd-ryzen-7-7700-cpu-next-to-its-cooler.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=720\u0026amp;h=400\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/amd-ryzen-7-7700-cpu-next-to-its-cooler.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=432\u0026amp;h=260\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/amd-ryzen-7-7700-cpu-next-to-its-cooler.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=432\u0026amp;h=260\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003cimg width=\"2100\" height=\"1400\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"An image showing the AMD Ryzen 7 7700 CPU next to its cooler.\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/amd-ryzen-7-7700-cpu-next-to-its-cooler.jpg\" src=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/amd-ryzen-7-7700-cpu-next-to-its-cooler.jpg\"/\u003e \u003c/picture\u003e \u003c/figure\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan data-field=\"label\"\u003eRelated\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch5\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-make-your-cpu-perform-better/\" title=\"How to make your CPU perform better\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e How to make your CPU perform better \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs your CPU not performing at its best?

It was, in fact, common advice to buy a chip one tier below than what you really needed and overclock it to achieve the performance level of the next-tier model. Buying the Ryzen 5 5600 instead of the Ryzen 5 5600X, or the Ryzen 7 7700 instead of the Ryzen 7 7700X is still a worthy trade-off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, if you are rocking an older CPU and don\u0026#39;t want to upgrade your system right now, you should definitely give overclocking a shot. You might be able to get a few more FPS or shave a few seconds off of your rendering time, allowing your setup to stay relevant till the next CPU generation, at least. Most users don\u0026#39;t upgrade their CPU as often as their graphics card or other components, so you might already have a pretty old chip ready to be overclocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA majority of gamers still use 1080p as their primary resolution. This group of users can benefit the most from a CPU overclock, especially if playing more CPU-dependent titles. If you are a budget user and don\u0026#39;t want to upgrade as often as others, overclocking your existing processor can help you maximize the value of your setup over the course of its lifecycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv data-include-community-rating=\"false\" id=\"0011-47f8-91e325d66265\" data-nosnippet=\"\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/overclock-ddr4-instead-of-buying-ddr5/\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/pxl_20240731_074618246-portrait-original.jpg\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/pxl_20240731_074618246-portrait-original.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=422\u0026amp;h=268\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/pxl_20240731_074618246-portrait-original.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=422\u0026amp;h=268\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/pxl_20240731_074618246-portrait-original.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=310\u0026amp;h=220\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/pxl_20240731_074618246-portrait-original.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=310\u0026amp;h=220\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/pxl_20240731_074618246-portrait-original.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=720\u0026amp;h=400\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/pxl_20240731_074618246-portrait-original.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=720\u0026amp;h=400\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/pxl_20240731_074618246-portrait-original.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=432\u0026amp;h=260\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/pxl_20240731_074618246-portrait-original.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=432\u0026amp;h=260\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003cimg width=\"4080\" height=\"2295\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Two red sticks of G.Skill Ripjaws DDR4 RAM on a desk mat\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/pxl_20240731_074618246-portrait-original.jpg\" src=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/pxl_20240731_074618246-portrait-original.jpg\"/\u003e \u003c/picture\u003e \u003c/figure\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan data-field=\"label\"\u003eRelated\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch5\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/overclock-ddr4-instead-of-buying-ddr5/\" title=\"Save your money by overclocking your DDR4 RAM instead of upgrading to DDR5\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Save your money by overclocking your DDR4 RAM instead of upgrading to DDR5 \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eRunning a DDR4 system and itching for a DDR5 upgrade?
