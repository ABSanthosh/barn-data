We'll get to the specs, but the compact size of the Astra Gaming Tablet is what truly defines this machine. RedMagic, naturally, bills it as a gaming tablet, but it could be an excellent travel companion for multimedia consumption and staying connected!

It's running a Snapdragon 8 Elite that has an advanced cooling system to rely on. There's a Liquid Metal layer on top of the SoC to move heat away from it and onto a complex vapor chamber. Then there's an active cooling fan that spins quietly to move heat out of the tablet.

Compact tablet doubters will say that you should just buy a foldable phone instead of a portable tablet. But there's definitely a place and suitable use cases for a high-end small tablet. It's superb for on-the-go multimedia enjoyment - videos simply are nicer on this than on your phone! And of course, the RedMagic Astra Gaming Tablet will excel at gaming in a way a phone wouldn't, thanks to its bigger canvas, its potent (and properly cooled) hardware, and its bigger battery!",
