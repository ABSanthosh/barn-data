  "text": "Whoop 5.0 $169 $199 Save $30 A simple but powerful wearable that tracks your health and activity metrics. The best part is that it's distraction-free, and can now be had for its best price. Even with its fifth iteration, there isn't much out there like Whoop. The brand has created something that people actually want, a distraction-free way of tracking your health and fitness metrics. Despite not having a screen, the Whoop 5.0 is a powerful device, and now for a limited time, it's on sale, coming in at just $169. This is the lowest price we've seen on this device, so get it while you can. What's great about the Whoop 5.0? As far as what the Whoop 5.0 offers, you get training, sleep, and recovery scores that give you a better idea of how your body works as a whole throughout your entire day. In addition, there's a step and activity monitor, along with data to show your VO2 max and heart rate zones. The Whoop 5.0 also comes with a haptic alarm system, along with a little over 14 days of battery life. The best part, though, is going to be the app. The Whoop app features an intuitive design that gives you all the important data at a glance. You can also deep dive into the details if you want. This is one of those unique experiences that really is different from what you get with a smartwatch or a fitness band. It's not for everyone, but those that go with Whoop tend to swear by it. Of course, you can always use it as a supplement to your current wearable setup as well. The only drawback is that Whoop does charge a monthly fee for its service, which means you'll be paying indefinitely so long as you use the device, which is quite different from say a Galaxy or Pixel Watch. With that said, the Whoop 5.0 is now on sale from Best Buy, with a discount that knocks it down to just $169. This is the best price we've seen on this model, and it also comes with 12 months of service as well. So you'll be able to enjoy the Whoop for a year with this purchase without having to do anything else. Of course, there are other membership tiers, so that might be something to look into if the base tier doesn't provide what you need.",

You can also deep dive into the details if you want.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThis is one of those unique experiences that really is different from what you get with a smartwatch or a fitness band. It\u0026#39;s not for everyone, but those that go with Whoop tend to swear by it. Of course, you can always use it as a supplement to your current wearable setup as well.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe only drawback is that Whoop does charge a monthly fee for its service, which means you\u0026#39;ll be paying indefinitely so long as you use the device, which is quite different from say a Galaxy or Pixel Watch. With that said, the Whoop 5.0 is now on sale from Best Buy, with a discount that knocks it down to just $169.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThis is the best price we\u0026#39;ve seen on this model, and it also comes with 12 months of service as well. So you\u0026#39;ll be able to enjoy the Whoop for a year with this purchase without having to do anything else. Of course, there are other membership tiers, so that might be something to look into if the base tier doesn\u0026#39;t provide what you need.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
