This new design is also optimized for video with a dedicated livestream button, a recording button on the front of the camera, and a tripod screw hole on the side for portrait recording. The R50V uses the RF-mount and is compatible with all Canon RF lenses, including the newly launched RF-S14-30mm F4-6.3 IS STM PZ, which is the first RF-S lens with power zoom functionality. The camera uses a 24MP APS-C sensor with Dual Pixel CMOS AF II and DIGIC X processor. It can shoot videos up to 4K in 60fps with a crop and YCC 4:2:2 10-bit. It also supports Canon Log 3 so you can match it with Canon's Cinema EOS line. The Canon PowerShot V1 is priced at $900. The EOS R50 V is priced at $650 for the body-only and $850 with the RF-S14-30mm F4-6.3 IS STM PZ lens. Both cameras will be available in April. Source",
