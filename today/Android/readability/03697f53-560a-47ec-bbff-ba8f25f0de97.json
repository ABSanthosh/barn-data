  "text": "Summary Some Android auto users are experiencing missing alternate routes on Google Maps. There doesn't appear to be any acknowledgement of the issue from Google. The usual temporary fixes don't work. The alternate routes function on Google Maps is one of its most useful functions. It's a feature that suggests slightly slower or faster routes in real time. It offers drivers flexibility when they account for traffic or construction. But for many, those suggestions have seemingly vanished. Related Some users have noticed a frustrating issue where alternate routes have stopped appearing on the Maps app for Android and Android Auto (via 9to5Google). It appears to be a glitch, and has been going on for a few weeks. No fix in sight for this weird glitch People have been reporting the issue all over Reddit and Google's official forums. Complaints are coming from both Android Auto users and people using the mobile app directly. The feature has been a core part of the Google Maps experience for years, which makes it more noticeable when it suddenly isn't available. The issue appears to be a glitch introduced in recent app versions or server-side updates. It doesn't seem to be affecting Apple's CarPlay version of Google Maps. Google hasn't confirmed or commented on the issue. This isn't the first time Google Maps has been hit by a bug affecting core features. A bug caused havoc with users' timelines earlier this year, and the app was constantly crashing for people after an Android 14 update last year. Alternate route glitches have also occurred from time to time, usually as a result of regional server rollouts, but never at the volume we're seeing right now. The usual temporary workarounds don't seem to fix it There is no reliable workaround right now. You can attempt to restart the app, clear the cache, or even reboot your phone, but users report none of these methods have worked. Some people have resorted to previewing routes before they start driving, as if it were 2005 or something. They might as well blare Gwen Stefani and The Killers from their car while they're at it. This might be what you're stuck with, however, at least until Google rolls out a fix or even acknowledges the issue. Maps is such an essential tool for millions that any degradation in its navigation makes waves fast. In the meantime, you can try out a solid alternative .",
