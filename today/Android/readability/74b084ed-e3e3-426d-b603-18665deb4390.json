The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is a proper flagship with a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. It and its 2025 siblings are the first non-Samsung foldables with an IP48 rating – meaning protection against particles, not just water. The phone has a 7” internal display (165Hz LTPO, 1224p+, 10-bit Dolby Vision) and a 4” cover display (165Hz LTPO). The dual 50MP cameras are a main (1/1.56”, OIS) and ultra-wide this time and there is a third 50MP unit, the selfie camera. The 4,700mAh battery supports 68W wired and 30W wireless charging. The vanilla Motorola Razr 2025 runs on the much less powerful Dimensity 7400X chipset. The internal display is a 6.9” LTPO panel (120Hz, lower 1080p+ resolution, 10-bit color), while the cover display is a smaller 3.6” 90Hz panel. The cameras have a smaller 50MP sensor in the main (1/1.95”, OIS) and a lower resolution 13MP in the ultra-wide. The selfie camera has a 32MP sensor. The 4,500mAh battery does both 30W wired and 15W wireless charging. For $100 less you can have the previous model, the Motorola Razr 2024. It has basically the same chipset (Dimensity 7300X), the same displays and cameras too. The key differences are no particle protection (water resistance is still at IPX8) and a slightly smaller 4,200mAh battery (30W/15W charging). Both generations are slated for 3 OS updates, but the older model is at a disadvantage, of course. An interesting alternative is the Motorola Razr+ 2025. It’s a re-release of the 2024 Razr+ but now with IP48 rating (up from IPX8). And it starts at Android 15, so those 3 OS updates will go further. While not as powerful as the Ultra, the Razr+ 2025 still handily beats the vanilla models – it has a Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, a 6.9” 165Hz LTPO inner display (10-bit Dolby Vision) and a 4” cover display. The 50+50MP cameras on the back are a main (1/1.95”, OIS) and 2x telephoto, the selfie has a 32MP sensor. This model has a smaller 4,000mAh battery with 45W wired and 15W wireless charging. The revamped Razr+ is $300 less than the Razr Ultra, but it also has less memory (12/256GB vs. 16/512GB), which should be taken into consideration. You may be better off with a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip6 – it’s due to be replaced in a few months, but with 6 OS updates left to go (One UI 7 just came through), it will outlast the Motorolas. It’s powered by an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite and has an IP48 rating – Samsung was a pioneer in that respect. The displays aren’t as good with a 6.7” 120Hz LTPO panel inside (1080p+, HDR10+) and a 3.4” cover display. The battery has 4,000mAh capacity and 25W/15W charging. We move on to a quick overview of Samsung tablet deals. The Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ is from a couple of years ago and is a mid-range slate with a 12.4” 90Hz IPS LCD. It is powered by the Exynos 1380 chipset and still will be updated to Android 17. DeX is supported but only on the tablet’s own screen (due to the USB-C 2.0 port). The 256GB variant sells for $500 right now (note that there is a microSD slot for more storage). The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ is from the same vintage, so it’s update path should end at Android 17 as well. However, this one has a much more powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset and the 12.4” display is a 120Hz OLED panel. DeX is supported on external screens too (USB-C 3.2). The batteries on both slates are the same, 10,090mAh capacity and 45W wired charging. The current generation model is the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+. This one features a MediaTek chipset, the Dimensity 9300+ and is eligible for six more OS updates (it already received One UI 7). Chipset and support aside, the two tablets are fairly similar. You can have Windows on a similar-sized tablet too – the new Microsoft Surface Pro 12 features a 12” 90Hz LCD and is powered by the Snapdragon X Plus (8 cores). Unlike its Android competitors, this one has better connectivity with two USB-C ports with DP 1.4a support. An optional keyboard is available if you’re going to be dealing with a lot of text, a stylus is an option too. The Microsoft Surface Laptop 13 provides a better typing experience and since it doesn’t rely on a kickstand, you can actually use it on your lap. This one has a 13” 3:2 60Hz LCD and is powered by the Snapdragon X Plus. It is heavier than the tablet, 2.7lbs vs. 1.5lbs, but it promises longer battery life too, up to 23 hours vs. up to 16 hours. The Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro went for a stemmed design this generation. They offer great audio, better ANC and are quite comfortable – the stems enable easier controls. CMF launched a group of four TWS buds recently. In the meantime, the CMF Buds Pro 2 (which are from last year) have fallen in price and are currently cheaper than the CMF Buds 2 Plus. That makes them an easy pick for the dual-drivers. The CMF Buds 2 Plus support high-quality audio with LDAC (just like the Pro) and offer better battery life (up to 14 hours for the buds and a total of around 61 hours with the case). They only feature a single driver, though. The CMF Buds 2 have noise cancellation that is almost as good as on the 2 Plus and Pro 2. They have Dirac Opteo tuning but no LDAC support. All three CMF buds so far are rated IP55. The CMF Buds 2a are the cheapest of the family, but they still have some ANC (42dB vs. 48dB on the Buds 2 and 50dB on the Plus and Pro) and Dirac Tuning. These are rated IP54. We may get a commission from qualifying sales.",
