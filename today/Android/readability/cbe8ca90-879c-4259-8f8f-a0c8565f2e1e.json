These models would normally launch in September 2026, and one differentiating factor between them and the other two iPhone 18 models would be this under-display 3D face scanning tech, which would allow the duo to only have a single hole-punch for the selfie camera - no more notch.

Of course, the fact that Apple is testing the technology doesn't mean it will be happy with the results of the testing, but this is still promising. Being able to move the Face ID scanning tech under the display would give these iPhones a much more seamless look on the front, just like their Android-powered counterparts have had for years - but in that case at the expense of not actually having 3D face scanning and relying solely on the camera for unlocking, which is a much less secure way of doing things. The notch would be gone if this rumor pans outSo with under-display Face ID, we'd get the best of both worlds - no more unsightly notches, but with the security we've come to expect from Apple's solution. Interestingly, the first folding iPhone is also being tested with under-display Face ID. The iPhone 18 and iPhone 18 Air will rely on the traditional notch, at least for the time being.
