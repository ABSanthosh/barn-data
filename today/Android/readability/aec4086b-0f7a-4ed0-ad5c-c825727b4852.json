But a lot of that requires manual input, which is why Google’s rumored Project Jarvis sounds like it could take AI to the next level. According to a report from The Information (paywall), Google is apparently working on a new AI model codenamed Project Jarvis. It is an AI that can carry out tasks and do things for users, such as do research, purchase a product, make a booking for a flight, and so on. It is designed to be used with browsers and will help users automate day-to-day web-based tasks. Whether or not it will work with all browsers remains to be seen. The report does suggest that it is tuned specifically for Chrome. That doesn’t really come as a surprise since we imagine Google will use it as a way to get more users to use Chrome. The concept of Project Jarvis isn’t completely new. Google had previously shown off features that could help users make bookings, stay on the line for them, and so on, but this could take things further. The report claims that Google could show off their new AI model in December, but that could be subject to change so we’ll just have to wait and see. A graphic novelist wannabe. Amateur chef.
