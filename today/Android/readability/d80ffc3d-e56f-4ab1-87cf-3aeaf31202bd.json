  "text": "Building a PC can be a complicated endeavor, particularly for a first-timer. Even when it comes down to cooling, it can be hard to decide on picking up an air cooler or an all-in-one (AIO) water cooling system. If you go for the latter and start to hook everything up, you'll notice that there may be multiple SYS_FAN headers, a CPU_FAN header, and an AIO_PUMP header on your motherboard. There's a difference between all of these, but it's somewhat complicated, and you may need to hop into your BIOS depending on your configuration. Breaking down the difference between CPU_FAN, SYS_FAN, and PUMP They may all seem the same, but they're not Motherboard headers control different components in your PC, and as the name suggests, anything with \"_FAN\" is for a standard fan. The CPU_FAN specifically refers to the fan that attaches to the heatsink of your CPU, whereas SYS_FAN is typically used for case fans. On some older motherboards, CPU_FAN might be the only controllable fan header where an RPM can be specified. This is because it's keyed to your CPU's temperature, meaning that when your CPU temperature goes up, your computer can increase power to the fan. AIO_PUMP, however, can be used in different ways, and some all-in-one coolers neglect to use them entirely. It's used to power the pump in the cooler so that the coolant can flow consistently. They typically run at full power, meaning that if you put another fan into that slot, chances are it will run at full speed consistently. There are some exceptions; some motherboards will allow you to adjust the power, but there's not really much point in using a PUMP header for a fan. Depending on your cooling, you might plug the AIO's pump into the AIO_PUMP header and the fan attached to the radiator into CPU_FAN. However, even in my case, I use the Corsair H100i Elite Capellix. This comes with a separate fan controller, and the only cable that plugs into a header on my motherboard connects to CPU_FAN and is used to monitor the pump. Some motherboards will fail to boot if CPU_FAN is empty, and others may require you to enter the BIOS and disable a CPU_FAN check to ensure that your computer can boot. The method Corsair uses avoids both of these problems. In other words, your FAN headers are all used for airflow purposes. Just because the connectors are interchangeable doesn't mean you should just plug in your cables in random places, as they still have a specified purpose. The PUMP header is specifically for cooling pumps, and you shouldn't use it for a case fan unless you're completely out of options, as it will run at full speed. Related 3 ways to improve your PC's airflow without buying more fans Not a fan of more fans? Here's how to make the most of the ones you have. If you need more fans, get a fan controller Most people don't need one, though If you're running out of FAN headers in your motherboard and you need more, then your likely best bet is to get a fan controller. This is a separate piece of hardware that will manage all of your PC's fans for you, and there will typically be a piece of software you can install to modify those controls. I have the Corsair iCUE Commander Core, but there are plenty of alternative options out there supporting a wide range of hardware. A fan controller isn't typically necessary for most people, but in the event that you have no more fan headers, it can be a worthwhile investment. In general, I wouldn't recommend investing in a fan controller unless it's completely necessary. They add an additional layer of complexity to your build and will require rewiring your existing fans to plug into it instead. It has an advantage in that it undoubtedly gives you significantly more control over your PC's cooling, but most people simply don't need it. The first step is knowing where everything needs to be plugged in on your motherboard, and you can decide once everything is connected if you need to make that additional investment or not. If you want more granular control over your fans, Fan Control is a great application to give you just that.",

This is a separate piece of hardware that will manage all of your PC\u0026#39;s fans for you, and there will typically be a piece of software you can install to modify those controls. I have the Corsair iCUE Commander Core, but there are plenty of alternative options out there supporting a wide range of hardware. A fan controller isn\u0026#39;t typically necessary for most people, but in the event that you have no more fan headers, it can be a worthwhile investment.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIn general, I wouldn\u0026#39;t recommend investing in a fan controller unless it\u0026#39;s completely necessary. They add an additional layer of complexity to your build and will require rewiring your existing fans to plug into it instead. It has an advantage in that it undoubtedly gives you significantly more control over your PC\u0026#39;s cooling, but most people simply don\u0026#39;t need it. The first step is knowing where everything needs to be plugged in on your motherboard, and you can decide once everything is connected if you need to make that additional investment or not. If you want more granular control over your fans, \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/fan-control-guide/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFan Control\u003c/a\u003e is a great application to give you just that.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
