  "text": "A while back, Xiaomi unveiled its new budget-friendly Redmi Watch 5 smart wearable, and while the device was initially exclusive for Chinese markets it looks like it’s now available for more regions worldwide, following the debut of the new POCO X7 series phones and the Redmi Note 14 Pro. Priced starting at 109 EUR (or around 110 USD when converted), the Redmi Watch 5 features an aluminum frame with a 2-inch AMOLED display, which comes with a peak brightness of 1,500 nits. It’s also powered by a 550 mAh battery, which Xiaomi claims is enough to last a maximum of 36 days with power saving, or 12 days with AOD enabled. READ: Redmi Note 14 Pro Review: Almost Pro? For software, there’s HyperOS onboard which means users will get the usual suite of Xiaomi-centric apps and services. There’s a new heartrate sensor that provides better accuracy this time around, in addition to other usual features like sleep tracking, stress and blood oxygen measurements, as well as sports and fitness tracking.",
