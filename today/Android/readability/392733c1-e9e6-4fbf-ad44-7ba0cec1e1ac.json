You can see all three of these next to each other in the image below. Pantone Dazzling Blue is also shown in a bunch of different angles, but not the other two. The phone has a 6.72-inch 1080x2400 LCD touchscreen with 120 Hz refresh rate, 1,000-nit peak brightness, and Gorilla Glass 7i on top, a 50 MP main camera with f/1.8 aperture that uses Sony's Lytia LYT-600 sensor, an 8 MP f/2.2 ultrawide, and a 32 MP f/2.2 selfie snapper. At the helm sits MediaTek's Dimensity 7060 SoC, paired with 4/8GB of RAM and 128/256GB of storage. The battery capacity is 5,200 mAh, and it supports 33W wired charging. The G56 also has stereo speakers, microSD card support, and it's IP68 and IP69 certified for dust and water resistance as well as MIL-STD-810H certified for ruggedness and durability. It measures 165.75 x 76.26 x 8.35 mm and weighs 200g. It will run Android 15 when it launches and is promised to receive one OS upgrade for the entry-level version and two for the level-up iteration, with three/four years of security patches respectively. According to a leak from March, the G56 will cost €250 with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Source (in Dutch)",
