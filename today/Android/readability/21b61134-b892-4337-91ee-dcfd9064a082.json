  "text": "While the Galaxy Watch 7 series is Samsung’s current range of flagship wearable devices, that’s not to say that its other models are “obsolete” – one good example of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6, which is currently on sale at the moment. Launched a while back, Samsung’s previous-gen smartwatch still packs a punch. In addition to a minimalist design (that’s also water resistant), the Galaxy Watch 6 runs on Wear OS which means that you get access to a ton of different apps including those from Samsung and third parties as well, such as Google Wallet, Google Maps and more. It also features a range of tracking functionality, including sleep tracking, step count, a wealth of exercise modes, and more. You can check out the deal using the link below.
