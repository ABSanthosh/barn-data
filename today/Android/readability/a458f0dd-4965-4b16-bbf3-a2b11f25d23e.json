Take for example the Steam Deck OLED, which will soon be available in a white model. Valve recently announced that the limited edition – yes, you read that right – white model will be available worldwide on November 18th, 2024 at 3PM PST. Priced at $679, the console will come with pretty much all of the same internal hardware specifications, except in a different color. It will also be available in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong (via Komodo) and Australia. The white version of the Steam Deck OLED will be bundles with an exclusive white carrying case as well as a white microfiber cleaning cloth. Valve says that customers are limited to one purchase per account, and users must have made a Steam purchase before November 2024 and be in good standing to be eligible. Given that it’s a limited edition release, Valve says that it will not be manufacturing additional units once the console sells out. Limited-edition console launches are nothing new, although they can be cumbersome at times especially with few quantities – just a while back, scalpers scooped up a ton of Sony’s 30th Anniversary PS5 Pro units, resulting in some rather frustrated buyers and fans.
