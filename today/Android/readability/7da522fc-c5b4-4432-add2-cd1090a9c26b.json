  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Proton Mail is revamping its Android \u0026 iOS apps for faster performance, offline mode, \u0026 advanced search. The new Proton Mail app will include features like category view and better stability. The Proton ecosystem updates include a rebuilt Calendar app with a focus on search, tasks, offline access \u0026 team setup. Proton Mail is getting one of its biggest overhauls yet. The Swiss privacy-focused email will soon have a completely rebuilt Android app, set to arrive this summer. Related What is Proton Mail? The privacy-first email service explained The company announced today that it is rebuilding both its Android and iOS apps using a new architecture. Proton says this will enable faster performance, better stability, and major features like offline mode and advanced search. Internal testing of the new app is already underway. Here's everything coming to the new Proton Mail app The newly rebuilt Proton Mail app will come with many new features, some of which users have been asking for. Full offline mode is one those features. Users can finally read and write emails without needing to stay connected to the internet. This has been one of the most frequently requested features by the Proton community, especially for those travelling or in low-signal areas. Proton says it is also implementing a new and improved advanced search tool that will make it easier to find emails, attachments, and even entire threads. There are also stability improvements and an overall speed boost as part of the rewrite. One of the more exciting additions to the new app is the Category View that is coming. This is like Gmail's categories. It automatically sorts emails into categories by message type and includes new tools to unsubscribe from newsletters and automate inbox cleanup. There will also be a new view to browse all received attachments in one place. The entire Proton ecosystem is getting updated Proton has an entire suite of privacy-focused apps. The Proton Calendar is arguably the most popular app, after Proton Mail, and it is getting a similar architecture rewrite. The new Calendar will come with a focus on search, task support, and offline access. Businesses will be able to set up small teams without needing their own domain, while implementing retention rules for compliance. This is all part of an ambitious roadmap the company set for 2025 in its push to become a full privacy-first alternative to the major data-stealing tech ecosystems. Everything from Proton Drive to Proton Pass is getting an update. The company says it relies heavily on feedback from its large community of Proton fans to drive development.",

Full offline mode is one those features. Users can finally read and write emails without needing to stay connected to the internet. This has been one of the most frequently requested features by the Proton community, especially for those travelling or in low-signal areas.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eProton says it is also implementing a new and improved advanced search tool that will make it easier to find emails, attachments, and even entire threads.

This is like Gmail\u0026#39;s categories. It automatically sorts emails into categories by message type and includes new tools to unsubscribe from newsletters and automate inbox cleanup. There will also be a new view to browse all received attachments in one place.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"the-entire-proton-ecosystem-is-getting-updated\"\u003e\n            The entire Proton ecosystem is getting updated\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProton has an entire suite of privacy-focused apps. The Proton Calendar is arguably the most popular app, after Proton Mail, and it is getting a similar architecture rewrite. The new Calendar will come with a focus on search, task support, and offline access. Businesses will be able to set up small teams without needing their own domain, while implementing retention rules for compliance. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003e\nThis is all part of an ambitious roadmap the company set for 2025 in its push to become a full privacy-first alternative to the major data-stealing tech ecosystems.
