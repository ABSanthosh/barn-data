In addition to a lot of modern smartphone feature, the two are notably among the first few Android phones to offer users a taste of Google’s Veo 2 functionality via the built-in Photos app. READ: The Honor 400 Lite Comes with a Dedicated AI Camera Button For those unfamiliar, Google’s Veo 2 is an AI tool of sorts that lets users create videos, although in this case it’s used with the rather-impressive AI Image to Video feature, which is built into Android and Magic OS. This lets users upload a photo to the app and then generate a five-second moving clip from the original image—think of those moving pictures from the Harry Potter movies. (check out the clips below) https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VID_20250519_191708.mp4 https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VID_20250519_215155.mp4 Other AI-based photo editing tools include ‘AI Eraser’, ‘AI Outpainting’, ‘AI Erase passers-by’, and ‘AI Remove Reflection’ which work using some of Google’s backend magic, so you’ll need to be online to use these features. Honor is also hyping up the camera capabilities on the Pro model, which includes a 200MP “AI Super Zoom” camera that can enhance greatly-zoomed photos for better clarity. As for hardware, the camera features a 1/1.4-inch large sensor, f/1.9 aperture, OIS + EIS dual stabilization, and 50X Zoom as well. You’ll also find a 12MP 112° Ultra-Wide and Macro Camera setup in addition to a 50MP Portrait Selfie Camera with f/2.0 aperture. The 400 Pro also comes with a 6.7-inch AMOLED display that peaks a 5,000 nits of brightness, with a 2800 x 1280 pixel resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. There’s also a 6,000 mAh silicon-carbon battery inside, along with 12GB of RAM and up to six years of Android software updates. Meanwhile, the “standard” Honor 400 model also comes with the same AI editing tools, although it’s a bit on the smaller side. The 400 packs a 6.55-inch AMOLED display (with the same brightness levels), although it does have a slightly smaller 5,300 battery and loses the third lens found on its larger sibling. It also takes a step down in the processor department, with a Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipset alongside 8GB of RAM. READ: HONOR Steps up its Software Support for the 400 Series The Honor 400 Pro 5G is available from £699.99 in Lunar Grey and Midnight Black, while the Honor 400 5G starts at £399.99 for the 256GB storage model and £449 for the 512GB storage model, and is available in Desert Gold, Lunar Grey, and Midnight Black.",
