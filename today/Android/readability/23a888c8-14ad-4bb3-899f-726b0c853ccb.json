Poco C75 leaked images On the rear there's a 50 MP main camera and a 0.08 MP decorative lens. Selfies are going to be taken care of by a 13 MP camera. The phone also boasts a side-mounted fingerprint sensor embedded in the power button, NFC, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, and a 5,160 mAh battery with support for 18W wired charging. Compared to the C65 which launched last year, the new model comes with a larger screen with a higher refresh rate, a higher-res selfie camera, and a slightly bigger battery. The Poco C75 measures 171.9 x 77.8 x 8.2 mm and weighs 204g. That makes it marginally taller, less wide, thicker, and heavier than its predecessor. Source",
