  "text": "There’s a lot of talk going on at the moment about Samsung’s recent developments surrounding wireless charging technology, including Qi2 hardware. More specifically, the company’s new S2MIW06 power management chip holds a lot of promise, at least as far as wireless charging tech is concerned. As such, the S2MIW06 can handle wireless charging speeds at a maximum of 50W, whereas most devices currently come with a standard 15W wireless charging speeds. The S2MIW06 also supports different Qi charging profiles including Magnetic Power Profile (MPP), which is required for Qi2 charging certification. READ: Anker unveils new Qi2 compatible wireless charging solutions at IFA 2024 It should be noted that MPP works with 25W charging, although it’s speculated that Samsung’s new S2MIW06 chip might be able to push this further. Additionally, there’s talk that the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S25 devices might come with Qi2 support, which if true will be a big win for the industry. While Qi2 wireless charging has a lot of benefits, most manufacturers have yet to adopt the standard or integrate it into their products, and as such this has been the subject of much debate over recent years. In any case, it should be interesting to see if Samsung is capable of pushing the industry forward in this aspect. Source: Android Authority",
