For example, while the Pixel 9 has looked vastly different from the Pixel 8 and 7 for example, it’s kept the signature camera bar design that’s come to define the Pixel smartphone series. READ: Pixel 9a Leaks Continue with Marketing Materials And while this might not be the case with the upcoming Pixel 9a, it looks like the company is sticking to last year’s design principles with the upcoming Pixel 10 series phones. Newly-leaked renders from the folks over at Android Headlines (in collaboration with @Onleaks) show how the Pixel 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and the regular 10 will look, and it looks like Google will be reusing the design language that it introduced with the Pixel 9 series. The phones are expected to come with pretty much the same exact design as seen with the Pixel 9 series, albeit with one key exception – this time around, it’s expected that the “standard” Pixel 10 model will now come with an additional third lens, versus the dual setup that was seen on previous base-level Pixel flagships. The rest of the lineup will feature similar dimensions, as well as the same camera design, and flat sides.
