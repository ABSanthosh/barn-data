READ: Here’s How to Use the Spotify Extension for Gemini on Android Currently, Spotify offers several versions of its Premium subscription tiers in the US, which include Premium Individual ($11.99/month), Premium Duo ($16.99/month), Premium Family ($19.99/month), and Premium Student for $5.99/month. It’s expected that the Pro-tier subscription will cost 6 bucks more than Spotify’s current plans, although it will include features such as higher-quality audio, access to concert tickets, and even “song-editing” tools. No other specifics regarding the Pro plan are known at the moment, although Spotify is reportedly testing the new subscription tier and its features at the moment; it’s also unclear when exactly the Pro plan will roll out for users.
