There are a few differences between the Camon 40 Pro 5G and its 4G counterpart - the 5G model has a 4nm Dimensity 7300 chipset to the 4G model's 6nm Helio G100. The 5G model also has a faster 144Hz display. The Tecno Camon 40 Pro 5G ships with a nice design-matching case, a 45W charger, and a USB-A to USB-C cable.

There are a few differences between the Camon 40 Pro 5G and its 4G counterpart - the 5G model has a 4nm Dimensity 7300 chipset to the 4G model's 6nm Helio G100. The 5G model also has a faster 144Hz display. The Tecno Camon 40 Pro 5G ships with a nice design-matching case, a 45W charger, and a USB-A to USB-C cable. Tecno is embracing the whole AI buzz - the new Camon 40 Pro 5G has a dedicated AI button on the upper left side. It's orange-coated and has a knurled surface. Holding the button summons Tecno's Ella voice assistant, which uses the DeepSeek R1 language model. A double press will open up the camera for what Tecno has dubbed FastSnap mode. The display of the Tecno Camon 40 Pro cascades at the edges. It's a very curved panel, which some of us here at HQ love - there's a place in life for pretty curved glass, not everything needs to be flat and sharp. Tecno has continued its classy design for yet another Camon series - the 40 Pro looks very similar to its predecessor, including the Swan Neck line running through the back of the phone. Because of it, the phone doesn't sit flat on a table but that's easily fixable if you use the case supplied in the box. Our unit comes in Galaxy Black and has a lovely textured surface. Tecno has once again included the tally light - a little red dot that blinks when you're recording video to let your subject know. It's a nice little touch even if it hardly contributes much to usability. Off we go to run a few tests on this bad boy and we'll report back!",
