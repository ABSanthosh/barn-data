  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account T-Mobile is going to be one of the more generous carriers when it comes to freebies. T-Mobile Tuesdays have been going on for nearly a decade, with the brand offering food, branded merchandise, and access to popular services and events for free. The offerings change from week to week, but it appears that the Apple TV+ perk is back for a limited time, giving those with a qualifying plan a free six-month subscription. Related While customers on the Experience Beyond or Experience More plan will have access to Apple TV+ on a permanent basis, Magenta, Go5G, and ONE subscribers do not. That's where this new limited-time perk comes in handy, with The Mobile Report reporting that those who normally don't have access will now get a chance to enjoy the latest shows and movies that are available on Apple TV+ for free (via TmoNews). A popular perk that's come back around Now, if this seems like déjà vu, it's because T-Mobile has offered this perk in the past. The good news is that those that took advantage of this promotion before will still be eligible to get it for free this time around as well. While Apple TV+ doesn't have the deepest library of content, it does have some high-quality shows like Ted Lasso, Severance, Silo, and many more. So if this sounds like something you'd be interested in, you'll want to head into the T-Life app, and claim this reward while it's still available. T-Mobile shares that this perk will be available to all that qualify until July 28, or while supplies last. It's important to grab this promotion while you can because some of the perks offered by T-Mobile tend to be more popular than others, which results in a short window of time when you can claim them.",

The good news is that those that took advantage of this promotion before will still be eligible to get it for free this time around as well. While Apple TV+ doesn\u0026#39;t have the deepest library of content, it does have some high-quality shows like Ted Lasso, Severance, Silo, and many more.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eSo if this sounds like something you\u0026#39;d be interested in, you\u0026#39;ll want to head into the T-Life app, and claim this reward while it\u0026#39;s still available. T-Mobile shares that this perk will be available to all that qualify until July 28, or while supplies last. It\u0026#39;s important to grab this promotion while you can because some of the perks offered by T-Mobile tend to be more popular than others, which results in a short window of time when you can claim them.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
