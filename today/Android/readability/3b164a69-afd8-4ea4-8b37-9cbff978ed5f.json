The extra subscription is monthly, meaning it can be canceled at any time with no extra charges. Mike Hopkins, Senior Vice President and Head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios said the partnership will give viewers “an incredible breadth of viewing options.” An official press release pointed out that Apple Original films, documentaries, and series have earned 516 wins and 2,308 award nominations, including the multi-Emmy Award-winning comedy Ted Lasso. The subscription is not limited to Apple owners and users. Everyone in the United States can enjoy the content on virtually any device Prime Video is available on. While the report did say \"additional territories to follow,\" we don't have a timeline for that. Source",
