However, this expansion has been marred with plenty of confusion since Xiaomi decided to use identical names for slightly different devices. Thankfully, the Redmi Note 14 Pro 4G, which we have for review today, seems to be available only in one version and only in global markets. At least for now, that is. As its name suggests, the Redmi Note 14 Pro 4G aims to deliver the \"Pro\" Redmi experience on a budget by cutting down some aspects. Notably the 5G connectivity and the chipset. The MediaTek Helio G100 is a modest part that is quite similar to the popular Helio G99, but it still offers pretty modern connectivity and additional options. Don't expect chart-topping performance from it, but it should be quite efficient. Plus, Xiaomi is making use of the upgraded ISP here by including a high-resolution 200MP main camera. Xiaomi Redmi Note 14 Pro 4G (Global) specs at a glance: Body: 162.2x74.9x8.2mm, 180g; Glass front (Gorilla Glass Victus 2), plastic frame, plastic back; IP64 dust and splash resistant. Display: 6.67\" AMOLED, 1B colors, 120Hz, 1800 nits (peak), 1080x2400px resolution, 20:9 aspect ratio, 395ppi. Chipset: Mediatek Helio G100 Ultra (6 nm): Octa-core (2x2.2 GHz Cortex-A76 \u0026 6x2.0 GHz Cortex-A55); Mali-G57 MC2. Memory: 128GB 8GB RAM, 256GB 8GB RAM, 256GB 12GB RAM, 512GB 12GB RAM; UFS 2.2; microSDXC (uses shared SIM slot). OS/Software: Android 14, HyperOS. Rear camera: Wide (main): 200 MP, f/1.7, 23mm, 1/1.4\", 0.56µm, multi-directional PDAF, OIS; Ultra wide angle: 8 MP, f/2.2, 15mm, 120-degree, 1/4.4\", 1.0µm; Macro: 2 MP, f/2.4. Front camera: 32 MP, f/2.2, (wide). Video capture: Rear camera: 4K@24/30fps, 1080p@30/60/120fps, gyro-EIS, OIS; Front camera: 1080p@30/60fps. Battery: 5500mAh; 45W wired. Connectivity: LTE; Wi-Fi; BT 5.3; NFC; Infrared port. Misc: Fingerprint reader (under display, optical); dual speakers; Virtual proximity sensing. Other than that, the Redmi Note 14 Pro 4G looks pretty solid hardware-wise. Its display isn't quite on the level of the Pro 5G model, but it is still quite impressive with its 120Hz refresh rate and OLED tech. Xiaomi has a good track record of delivering in the display department. The phone also has a stereo speaker system, a microSD memory expansion slot, an IR blaster and NFC in some markets. It is well-made with a Gorilla Glass Victus 2 front glass and an IP64 ingress protection rating. The onboard battery is a hefty 5,500 one with decent 45W fast charging. Unboxing The Redmi Note 14 Pro 4G comes in a rather unassuming white, two-piece cardboard box. It is quite thick and offers plenty of protection. There seems to be no plastic anywhere, which is pretty eco-friendly. The retail package will vary based on region. Our review unit came bundled with a 45W Xiaomi HyperCharge charger, but we see most EU regions don't get one in the box. The charger comes with a USB Type-A port, which is not ideal, especially considering that the charger appears to use an additional pin. That effectively makes the included USB Type-A to Type-C cable proprietary. You should keep track of it alongside the charger. Beyond that, the box also has a nice thick, soft, black TPU case.",
