The screen sizes have shrunk ever so slightly compared to the previous prototype, but their resolutions and aspect ratios have remained the same. Undoubtedly, Apple still has a lot of time to nail the exact specifications it wants for the iPhone Fold, so a lot of this can (and probably will) change in the future. But it's interesting to see the company going the under-display camera route nevertheless. A previous rumor told us that Apple is focusing on minimizing the folding screen's crease, as well as equipping the iPhone Fold with a much higher-quality hinge than any of its competitors.
