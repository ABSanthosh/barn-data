  "description": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to arrive on January 22, so it's right around the corner. We already have plenty of details and leaks on the upcoming flagship, including some covering its camera setup. However, this new source appears to bring a very concrete and comprehensive list of camera sensors for the first time ever. Based on the files I obtained, here are the confirmed cameras of S25 Ultra. Confirms previous leaks about cameras. https://t.co/qrylnSnXt4 pic.twitter.com/vgj3r8ISL7— AssembleDebug (Shiv) (@AssembleDebug) December 27, 2024 Of course, this is still a leak...",

However, this new source appears to bring a very concrete and comprehensive list of camera sensors for the first time ever. — AssembleDebug (Shiv) (@AssembleDebug) December 27, 2024 Of course, this is still a leak and should be taken with a grain of salt, but if the source is correct, we are looking at an S25 Ultra camera setup that is almost identical to the current S24 Ultra. This includes a 200MP Samsung ISOCELL HP2 (1/1.3\", 0.6µm-2.4µm), f/1.7, 23mm sensor for the main camera, a 12MP Sony IMX754 (1/3.52\", 1.12µm), f/2.4, 67mm 3x telephoto, a 50MP Sony IMX854 (1/2.52\", 0.7-1.4µm), f/3.4, 111mm 5x telephoto and a 12MP Samsung ISOCELL S5K3LU (1/3.2\", 1.12µm), f/2.2, 26mm selfie camera. It seems that only the ultrawide uses new hardware based on a Samsung ISOCELL S5KJN3 sensor, commonly known as the GN3. It is a 50MP sensor with a 1/1.57\" optical size and 1.0 µm individual pixels. We are still holding out at least some hope that the S25 Ultra will see the debut of Samsung's new, more compact and advanced ALoP (All Lenses on Prism) telephoto design. Source",
