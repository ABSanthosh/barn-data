According to a new post by tech leaker Digital Chat Station, an overclocked version of the 9400 – which will likely be called the 9400 Plus – will be capable of maximum speeds of up to 3.7GHz, a bit faster than the 9400’s current 3.63GHz limit. His post adds that a couple of smartphone brands are already working on devices built around the 9400 Plus, although he did not specify which companies these are. READ: The MediaTek Dimensity 9400 just smoked Apple’s A18 Pro With that in mind however, it’s speculated by some that these phones might be the upcoming Oppo Find X8S and the Vivo X200S. Other brands predicted to use the 9400 Plus are Redmi and IQOO. The MediaTek Dimensity 9400 was originally launched back in October of 2024. A 3nm chip, the Dimensity 9400 features an “All Big Core” design built on Arm’s v9.2 CPU architecture, and integrates one Arm Cortex-X925 core operating over 3.62GHz with 3x Cortex-X4 and 4x Cortex-A720 cores.",
