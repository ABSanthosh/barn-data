Finally, on April 16, the Pixel 9a will go on sale in Australia, India, Singapore, Taiwan, and Malaysia. The phone will eventually also be available in Japan but with no confirmed launch date right now. The Pixel 9a was first announced earlier this month with a $499 starting price and no firm dates other than a vague April availability window. Since then we have learned that the company faced a component quality issue with the device that caused it to push back the release window as well as review embargoes. This was done as a precaution even though the issue seemingly only affected a small number of units. In the meantime, we have been working on the review and will be back around the release period with a fully functional unit in hand.",
