  "text": "After several years of trying to make it work in the foldable market, Microsoft has finally called it quits stopping their support of the Surface Duo 2 only 3 years after the phone’s release. Microsoft will end support for the Surface Duo 2 on the 21st of October 2024 after disappointing sales and adaptation of the $1500 foldable. The decision to end support for the Surface Duo 2 follows a pattern similar to the original Surface Duo, which was discontinued after seeing limited success. Despite its innovative form factor aimed at productivity users, the Duo 2 struggled due to software glitches and hardware limitations. Due to this and its prohibitive price tag meant the writing was on the wall for the Surface Duo 2. Android Central reported that Microsoft’s decision to pull the plug on support suggests that the company is shifting away from Android-based hardware ventures. This shift aligns with Microsoft’s broader focus on cloud services and artificial intelligence, rather than continuing in the competitive smartphone market. Microsoft’s official support page confirms that both the Surface Duo and Duo 2 will no longer receive software updates, leaving users to rely on third-party solutions if they wish to keep the devices secure and functional. With other OS’s appearing for discontinued phones like the original Fairphone, if there is enough enthusiasm we can hope that there will be support like /e/OS or Lineage OS. The end of the Surface Duo line, though brief, serves as a reminder of the hurdles companies face when trying to innovate in a crowded and fast-paced market. It seems like the same playbook played out with Microsoft where they were just on the cusp of getting on a trend and just missing out. This is a pity, and also a comment on the sheer pace of technology where so much can change in this space in such a short amount of time.
