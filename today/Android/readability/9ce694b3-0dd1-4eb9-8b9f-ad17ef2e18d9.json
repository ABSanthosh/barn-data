Galaxy Buds Core batteries have leaked• Case: 500mah battery • Buds: 100mah battery (each)Buds have 34mah larger batteries and 21mah larger case battery than the Buds FE pic.twitter.com/y0Bo4UogMe— Anthony (@TheGalox_) May 23, 2025 In a new development, an industry rumor has surfaced regarding the battery capacity of the buds and their respective charging case. As per the source, each bud will have a 100 mAh capacity, whereas the case will have a 500 mAh capacity. If this turns out to be true, it constitutes a pretty major increase over the 60 mAh batteries inside the Buds FE and the 479 mAh typical capacity of their charging case. We aren't sure whether the Buds Core will inherit the new stem design debuted by the Buds3 and Buds3 Pro. Such a massive battery increase in the buds sure points in that direction, but it remains to be seen. By the way, the accompanying render is not confirmed or official in any capacity. Source",
