Back in the day, vacuums were simple. They sucked up dirt and that was it. You had to push them around, move furniture, and do all the work yourself. Now, vacuums like the eufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1 E20 don’t just clean. They map your home, avoid obstacles, and handle sweeping, vacuuming, and mopping all in one go.  Anker’s latest eufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1 E20 follows the success of last year's X10 Pro Omni. It was unveiled in CES 2025, where it won the Best of Innovation award. It’s the first robot vacuum to win this award in recent years, showing just how innovative and advanced it is. Here's every reason why you need it. Use one vacuum in three ways The Anker eufy E20 vacuum comes with a FlexiONE design that allows it to transform into three different cleaning tools: a robot vacuum, a handheld vacuum, and a cordless stick vacuum. As a robot vacuum, it moves around your home, cleaning floors and carpets without you needing to do anything.  Image: Anker It uses sensors to navigate and avoid obstacles, ensuring thorough cleaning while you focus on other things. There's a millimeter-level triple-laser technology that makes this part possible from as small as 15mm of space. If you have toys, a charger cable on the floor, and other items, the eufy E20 will consider them obstacles. When you need to clean furniture, stairs, or tight spots, you can detach the vacuum module to use it as a handheld vacuum. This makes it easier to reach places that the robot vacuum can’t, like your couch or car seats.  Image: Anker As a cordless stick, you can use the vacuum for larger areas, hard-to-reach spots, and even walls or ceilings. In these modes, the product reaches up to 30,000Pa suction power, which is way above typical vacuums ranging from 2,000Pa to 5,000Pa. Related: Eufy S1 Pro Robot Vac \u0026 Mop Review: A Deep Cleaning Monster Say goodbye to hair tangles Tangled hair of all kinds is usually a common problem for many vacuums. Over time, strands can wrap around the brush roll, reducing suction. It would need manual cleaning or maintenance. The eufy 3-in-1 E20 addresses this issue with its auto-detangling brush, which combines rubber and bristle bristles along with anti-tangle comb teeth to stop hair from getting stuck.  More impressive is the five-stage filtration system. For vacuums, that means each stage targets a different particle size. Typically, there's a pre-filter that handles larger debris, a primary filter that catches smaller particles, a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter that traps fine dust and allergens, an activated carbon filter absorbing odors, and a fine dust filter for the tiniest particles. Image: Anker The vacuum also has an Auto-Empty Station that empties dust and debris into a sealed filter by itself, storing the waste for up to 75 days with a 350mL capacity. It also charges 40% faster than other models, going from 0% to 100% in approximately three hours. A presale will run from January 6 to February 9, 2025 where you can buy the vacuum. It'll be available on the official product page, and you'll get $50 off with a 100-day free return if you buy it early. The brand has also hinted at a giveaway on their Instagram page. There's a chance you can get the vacuum without any costs. The main launch will happen on February 10, and we should see the product on third-party platforms like Amazon, Best Buy, and Kohl’s with a starting price of $549.99.  Image: Anker Irene is an experienced writer with four years in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.

It\u0026#39;ll be available on the official product page, and you\u0026#39;ll get $50 off with a 100-day free return if you buy it early. The brand has also hinted at a giveaway on their Instagram page. There\u0026#39;s a chance you can get the vacuum without any costs. The main launch will happen on February 10, and we should see the product on third-party platforms like Amazon, Best Buy, and Kohl’s with a starting price of $549.99. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/?attachment_id=497684\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" width=\"653\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eufy-robot-vacuum-3in1-E20-product-653x640.png\" alt=\"eufy robot vacuum 3in1 E20 product design\" srcset=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eufy-robot-vacuum-3in1-E20-product-653x640.png 653w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eufy-robot-vacuum-3in1-E20-product-648x635.png 648w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eufy-robot-vacuum-3in1-E20-product-380x372.png 380w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eufy-robot-vacuum-3in1-E20-product-550x539.png 550w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eufy-robot-vacuum-3in1-E20-product-800x784.png 800w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eufy-robot-vacuum-3in1-E20-product-1160x1136.png 1160w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eufy-robot-vacuum-3in1-E20-product.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20width=\u0026#39;653\u0026#39;%20height=\u0026#39;640\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%20653%20640\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-src=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eufy-robot-vacuum-3in1-E20-product-653x640.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eufy-robot-vacuum-3in1-E20-product-653x640.png 653w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eufy-robot-vacuum-3in1-E20-product-648x635.png 648w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eufy-robot-vacuum-3in1-E20-product-380x372.png 380w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eufy-robot-vacuum-3in1-E20-product-550x539.png 550w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eufy-robot-vacuum-3in1-E20-product-800x784.png 800w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eufy-robot-vacuum-3in1-E20-product-1160x1136.png 1160w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eufy-robot-vacuum-3in1-E20-product.png 1280w\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eImage: Anker\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eIrene is an experienced writer with four years in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.
