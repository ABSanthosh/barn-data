  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Early rumors suggest Samsung may skip the release of One UI Watch 7. Instead, the brand may skip from One UI Watch 6, and go straight to One UI Watch 8. It's unclear what type of improvements the update will bring at this time. It may have taken some time, but the Samsung One UI 7 update has finally managed to roll out to all flagship devices in the US. With that said, all eyes are already on the future, with early rumors indicating that One UI 8 could make an early appearance, arriving sometime in the summer. Related And while many Samsung fans are looking forward to seeing what's next, some are wondering when the One UI Watch update will arrive to Samsung wearables. We know that the brand struggled to release its One UI 7 update for phones and tablets, which is why we might not even see an update for its smartwatches. A leap forward but not in the way you might expect While this might be a bit of a shocker to some, IposDev, the one that leaked the news through X, shares that Samsung could make a huge leap instead, skipping over One UI 7 and going straight to One UI 8 (via SamMobile). This would make sense if what we've been hearing about One UI 8 is true, with the update set to make a release in July with its new foldables. There's even some saying that a One UI 8 beta could arrive as early as June, which is just around the corner. When it comes to wearables, a major update doesn't really have the same impact since the devices are simpler than a smartphone or tablet. Of course, that doesn't mean it's not worth having, as the last release from Samsung brought some notable changes to the platform. With that said, it's always good to take this news with an open mind since Samsung hasn't officially chimed in with any concrete details about this change. There's always the potential that things could change in the future, or a small detail could be missing from this bit of extracted information. Regardless, One UI 8 from Samsung is set to arrive and, although it won't be a huge change from what we're seeing now, it will be a way for Samsung to solidify confidence in its brand, showing the world, and most importantly, people purchasing Samsung devices, that it still knows how to keep things on track, despite a huge miss with the release of One UI 7.",

When it comes to wearables, a major update doesn\u0026#39;t really have the same impact since the devices are simpler than a smartphone or tablet. Of course, that doesn\u0026#39;t mean it\u0026#39;s not worth having, as the last release from Samsung \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/stable-one-ui-6-watch-update-starts-rolling-out-to-samsung-galaxy-watches/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebrought some notable changes to the platform\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWith that said, it\u0026#39;s always good to take this news with an open mind since Samsung hasn\u0026#39;t officially chimed in with any concrete details about this change.
