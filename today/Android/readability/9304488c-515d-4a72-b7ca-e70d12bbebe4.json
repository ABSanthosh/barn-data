You can use your Pi to monitor your printer remotely, set up automated tasks, and even add some cool features to improve your printing setup. Whether you have just one printer or a lot of them, a Pi-based project can help you streamline your workflow. Let’s look at a few ideas for integrating a Raspberry Pi with a 3D printer, along with some tips on how each approach can improve your printing experience. Related 15 Set up OctoPrint on Raspberry Pi Enjoy remote control and real-time monitoring for smoother 3D printing OctoPrint is a popular tool that lets you control your 3D printer remotely using a Raspberry Pi. You can access your printer remotely through a simple web interface. You can start and stop prints, load G-code files, and watch your creations come to life. You can even add a camera to your printer to monitor its performance. If something goes wrong, you can control the print remotely from anywhere. OctoPrint also offers many customizable plugins that can improve your printing experience. If you want to use OctoPrint, you’ll need a Raspberry Pi. OctoPi is a pre-configured disk image that makes it easy to set up. You can install plugins to make your printing workflow even better. 14 Use a time-lapse and monitoring camera Record print progress and spot potential problems early Want to watch your 3D printer while you’re busy with other things? You can set up a Raspberry Pi-connected camera to do just that! You can even stream live or make time-lapse videos to see how your prints come together in a flash. Regularly checking your prints will help you catch problems early on, such as warping, clogged nozzles, or “spaghetti” issues. If you have remote access to the printer, you can monitor it even when you’re not there, and simply pause the print when necessary. Time-lapse videos are a cool way to show off your work. They show you how your printer builds layers and how detailed your prints are. Having a camera in place to capture this will offer you a home movie of your 3D printing process! 13 Build a 3D-printed Pi enclosure Create a compact housing with added touchscreen features A 3D printer is the perfect tool to make a custom case that keeps your Raspberry Pi and a small touchscreen display safe and sound. You can create a dedicated control panel by designing an enclosure that fits snugly on or near your printer. A touchscreen can work with OctoPrint or another interface, so you can access print jobs, check temperatures, and stop or start tasks without needing a separate computer. With the Raspberry Pi safely inside a printed enclosure, all the parts stay organized and protected from dust or bumps. You can go further by designing the enclosure to look stylish and sleek. You could even design it according to a special theme, like the LCARS from Star Trek. This project is both useful and fun to make. 12 Manage a 3D printer farm Oversee multiple machines and coordinate print tasks at scale Source: Unsplash If you have multiple 3D printers, a Raspberry Pi can be your central control center. With the right software, you can keep an eye on each printer, schedule print jobs in a queue, and collect data on what’s been completed. Managing a network of printers is excellent for small-scale production runs, educational labs, or maker spaces. You can cut down on manual work by having all your monitoring from a single dashboard. If you prefer a more distributed approach, you can also set up different Raspberry Pi units for each printer. This setup works well for big projects that involve multiple models. By controlling everything through the Pi, you can easily switch between printers and handle maintenance issues. 11 Automate filament runout detection Use sensors to pause prints and send immediate alerts Source: 3djpco/Thingiverse An OctoPrint filament sensor that connects to the Raspberry Pi GPIO header. Instructions for build available at Thingiverse. Want to know when your printer’s filament is running low or if it breaks mid-print? You can use a sensor that sends a signal to your Raspberry Pi, immediately stopping the print. That way, you can grab the new filament and return it to printing. You can also get notifications on your phone or via email so you know when the printer needs some TLC. This way, you don’t waste time or filament and can stop the printer before it even starts printing without any material. It’s pretty easy to set up and can save you a lot of hassle. Plus, it’ll help you track how much filament you’re using so you know when you need to order more. 10 Create a Raspberry Pi-based 3D scanner Capture objects in digital form for easier replication Thanks to the Raspberry Pi, building a DIY 3D scanner is now easier than ever. You can mount one or more cameras or use structured light or laser modules connected to the Pi. Then, special software processes the data and creates a 3D model of the scanned object. You can make this project as simple or complex as you want. Start with a turntable and a single camera, then move on to more advanced setups with multiple cameras around the subject. Once you have your 3D scan, you can use it to make copies or changes to the object. This is especially helpful for things that are hard to model from scratch. 9 Add environmental monitoring and control Maintain temperature and humidity for consistent printing results A Raspberry Pi can monitor temperature, humidity, and other essential details inside a printer. You can install sensors to send data to the Pi so you can log everything that happens. This way, you can see how the environment changes during printing. If you set things up right, the Pi can control fans, heaters, or dehumidifiers to keep things nice and consistent. This is especially important for materials like ABS or nylon, which can warp if the air isn’t stable. Regularly checking the enclosure conditions can help ensure things are going well. By tweaking the settings, you can find the perfect balance for each type of filament. 8 Create a custom control panel Add physical buttons and knobs for efficient adjustments Source: Makestreme/YouTube The GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi let you connect physical controls like buttons, switches, and rotary encoders. This means you can build a super compact panel to securely attach to a printer or enclosure. With just a knob, you can change settings like print speed and nozzle temperature without even looking at a screen. You can also wire buttons to pause, resume, or cancel a print job so that you don’t need a touchscreen or computer interface. You can enjoy a more tactile experience when printing 3D models. It’s especially great for people who want to make quick changes and don’t like getting lost in menus on a touchscreen or computer. 7 Implement AI-based print monitoring Let machine learning detect and address print failures With the help of lightweight machine learning models on the Raspberry Pi, you can give it the power to spot printing problems. It uses image recognition algorithms to find unusual patterns, such as spaghetti-like filament or significant differences in layer alignment. If the Pi spots a potential problem, it can stop or even shut down the printer. It can also send a message to your phone so you can decide what to do next. This way, you don’t waste too much material and don’t damage the printer. At first, setting up the AI models might take some time, but the extra assurances make it worth it. As you get more data from failed prints, you can improve your 3D printing setup. 6 Set up a network-based G-code repository Centralize your files and simplify printer access Setting up a small file server on your Raspberry Pi is a great way to organize your G-code files. You can use Samba or an FTP server to make sharing files with others on the network easy. This means you can stop manually transferring files using an SD card. Instead, you can keep all your design files in one place and easily track changes. You can even connect it to OctoPrint to start printing with just a click. Keeping all your G-code files in one place will make your workflow much smoother. You’ll know exactly where to find your files and avoid printing out old versions. 5 Monitor filament with a smart dry box Track humidity and protect materials for better prints Source: werner_rh/Printables.com Materials like nylon and PVA can soak up moisture, making your prints look bad. Even PLA can get this way, with the extra humidity causing stringing and pockmarks. To fix this, you can use a dry box with a Raspberry Pi and humidity sensors. The Pi can show or record the humidity levels and even control a small dehumidifier. Keeping your filament dry is a simple way to ensure your prints come out perfectly. You can also use a load cell or scale to track how much filament you have left, ensuring you have enough to finish your job. A dry box with sensors can also help you keep your materials fresh for longer. It reduces the chances of clogs, makes the layers stick better, and keeps your prints from failing. By adding load cells or scales, you’ll also be better able to track how much filament is left on the spool to help avoid running out. 4 Coordinate multi-material printing Manage multiple extruders and more complex designs A Raspberry Pi can be your handy sidekick if your printer has two or more extruders or a tool-changing setup. It can send commands to each extruder, monitor temperatures, and even wait for color changes. You can also write your own scripts to handle retraction or priming sequences. And if your printer supports advanced mixing features, you can use the Pi to make those happen. This makes multi-material printing a breeze, as the Pi handles all the complexity. Managing extruders through a Pi can also help you calibrate your printer. You can adjust each nozzle’s offset and make sure that layers are aligned perfectly during color or material changes. 3 Automate print removal Free up the build plate for continuous production Source: Zhenyu Luo / Unplash Imagine a Raspberry Pi-powered system that can sweep prints off the bed or conveyor belt. After a print job, the Pi moves the part to a collection area and starts the next job in line. This automation makes batch production or small business applications a breeze. It can also be a fun project for hobbyists who want to experiment with continuous 3D printing. One cool thing about this system is that it can sync bed cooling or movement with the ejection mechanism. This means you can print multiple parts without any interruptions. 2 Enable voice-activated printing commands Integrate simple speech controls for added convenience Want to control your 3D printer with your voice? You can do this by plugging in a microphone or integrating with a digital assistant. Then, you can give commands like preheating the nozzle, starting a print, or checking on the progress. This is handy when working with tools, as it frees up your hands. It also showcases the versatility of the Raspberry Pi and adds a modern touch to your maker space. You can use basic voice commands for everyday tasks, but you can develop more advanced setups if you want more control. Bear in mind that this kind of Pi integration will be a more advanced project. You might need to learn some coding to program the smart assistant to do what you want. 1 Build a Pi-powered post-processing station Simplify curing or smoothing steps with automation and safety Source: Greedy3D/YouTube A Raspberry Pi can handle the electronics for a UV curing chamber, resin cleaning station, or vapor smoothing setup. You can add timers, safety interlocks, and sensors to ensure the chamber is sealed before starting any operations. This automation allows you to control the post-processing steps precisely. For example, the Pi can control the UV exposure cycles when curing resin prints. It can also control the airflow and heating when smoothing ABS prints. Using a Pi gives you better control and allows you to monitor the time it takes. This is especially helpful when working with delicate or time-sensitive post-processing steps. Why these Pi-based ideas can empower 3D printing Each project here combines Raspberry Pi’s power with the unique needs of 3D printing. Whether you need remote control, automated tasks, or advanced monitoring, the Raspberry Pi can be a valuable, trusted assistant. By boosting your printer’s capabilities, you can focus on more creative aspects of the job and reduce tedious, repetitive tasks.",
