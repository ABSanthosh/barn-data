  "description": "Oppo's A5 line is soon going to add another member - the A5m. Despite not having been made official yet, this has been prematurely listed by a Polish retailer, and the listing has outed some of the phone's specs, along with its pricing in Poland. Let's start with that - it will go for PLN 899, which right now translates into approximately $239 or €211. For that amount of cash, you're getting a 6.67-inch 720x1604 LCD screen with 90 Hz refresh rate, the Snapdragon 6s Gen 1 chipset, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, a 50 MP main camera with a 2 MP decorative sensor next to it, a 5 MP selfie...",

The handset runs Android 15 and comes with Oppo AI, because of course it does. It has a 3.5mm headphone jack, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor embedded into the power button, and an IP65 rating for dust and splash resistance. It measures 165.71 x 76.24 x 7.99 mm and weighs 193g. If all of these specs sound familiar, it's because they are identical to those of the recently unveiled Oppo A5 4G, so the A5m is clearly a rebranded version of that model for specific markets. Via",
