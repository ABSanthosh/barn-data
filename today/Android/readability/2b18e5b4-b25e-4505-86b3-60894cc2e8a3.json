We’re not sure how long the deal will stand.I still want one of those giant curved monitors from Samsung, but they are usually prohibitively expensive. Some great deals come from time to time, though, and here’s a really nice one. The Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 (G91SD) 49-Inch Curved Gaming Monitor is usually $1,299.99, but today Sammy is offering some really nice incentives to sign up for it. For starters, it has a $300 discount. On top of that, the brand is throwing in a free JBL Quantum ONE headset valued at $299.95.While not Samsung’s best monitor in this category, this is a very capable screen for your gaming sessions. It measures in at 49 inches, so it is pretty huge. Additionally, it comes with a nice Dual QHD resolution of 5,120 x 1,440. This means it is essentially like putting two QHD monitors side by side. It’s an OLED panel, so it will also look gorgeous, making colors more vibrant and blacks deeper.You’ll get really nice specs, such as a 144Hz refresh rate, a 0.03ms response time, and a 1,800R curvature. Not to mention, the monitor will support plenty of standards gamers love. These include AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, adaptive brightness, VESA DisplayHDR True Black 400, and more.It also comes with plenty of ports, including HDMI, Micro-HDMI, Display Port, and USB-C.
