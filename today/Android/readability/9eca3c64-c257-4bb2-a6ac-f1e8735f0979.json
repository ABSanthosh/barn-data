Anker has built a reputation as the go-to brand for people who care less about flashy branding and more about performance that doesn’t fail. The company recently launched four new portable charging products under its Nano Series. The products target users who want compact, fast, and travel-friendly power solutions. The announcement was made today on June 10, 2025. All four Anker Nano products are now available in the UK, and surprisingly, three of them share the same price tag. The 5K power bank, 10K retractable cable model, and the 130W 6-port charging station each retail for £49.99 (≈ $68). The odd one out is the 45W wall charger, which is more affordable at £24.99 (≈ $34). You can get them on the brand's official website. Reliable power banks for everyone Anker Nano 5K power bank Image: Anker Anker’s latest Nano Power Bank is a slim wireless power bank designed specifically for the iPhone 12 to 16 series. It uses the new Qi2 wireless standard, offering up to 15W wireless charging with the 5,000mAh battery, which is on par with Apple’s MagSafe speed. It’s about the size of a credit card at just 8.6mm thick and has a flat, rectangular slab design with rounded edges and a matte black finish.  Its surface has a Qi2 wireless charging coil visibly etched into the center. There’s a subtle indicator light and a USB-C port located at the bottom edge, along with a row of LED lights showing battery status. The charger snaps magnetically onto the back of your iPhone and automatically for optimal charging. The 9N magnetic strength keeps it locked securely during use, even while you're moving around. You can also charge your phone with a USB-C cable through the wired 20W output port at the bottom if you prefer.

It has a glossy rectangular body with soft curves. The retractable USB-C cable wraps neatly into the side of the device, eliminating the need to carry an extra cable around. There's a small smart display on the front that shows the charging percentage and power status in real time. It delivers up to 45W fast charging with a 10,000mAh battery that’s enough to charge most smartphones at least twice. You can also use its extra USB-C and USB-A ports to charge two devices simultaneously. Plus, it supports pass-through charging, so you can recharge the power bank while it’s charging your phone. It’s smart enough to adjust power output and has 24/7 protection monitoring built in.

The new Anker Nano Charging Station in particular is a futuristic example of their innovation. It looks like an ultra-compact desktop hub designed to power up everything from laptops to earbuds without taking over your desk. It offers a total output of 130W with support for up to six devices at the same time. That includes four USB-C ports and two USB-A ports, with one USB-C port capable of pushing out up to 100W enough to fast-charge most laptops. It's merely 19mm thick and weighs 320g. Also, it uses Anker’s ActiveShield smart temperature control to protect multiple high-powered devices. Related: Anker 140W USB-C Charger Review Anker Nano 45W charger Image: Anker The Anker Nano 45W charger brings a more familiar design to Anker’s new Nano lineup. It looks like your typical wall adapter with a cubed frame. It's a 45W GaN fast charger that can power up a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra to 50% in 20 minutes with a foldable plug and a USB-C to USB-C cable. It supports a wide range of devices including Android phones, iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, earbuds, and more.  Irene is an experienced writer with five years' experience in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.
