  "text": "While modern smartphone chips usually have some form of protection against malicious software attacks, there are times when the unexpected still happens. This time it’s Qualcomm who’s in hot water, following a hacking exploit which targeted vulnerable Android devices running on Qualcomm’s chipsets. Referred to as a “zero-day” vulnerability, the security flaw allowed hackers to abuse an opening previously unknown to Qualcomm. At the moment however, it’s still generally unknown who is responsible for exploiting the vulnerability, which users were targeted and why. Google’s Threat Analysis Group as well as Amnesty International’s Security Lab have also looked into the matter. In relation to this, Qualcomm listed over 64 different chipsets affected by the vulnerability, including the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, which is found in a large number of Android phones from brands including Motorola, Samsung, OnePlus, Oppo, Xiaomi, and ZTE. Speaking to the folks over at TechCrunch, Qualcomm representative Catherine Baker praised the teams from Google Project Zero and Amnesty International Security Lab “for using coordinated disclosure practices.” The company has since worked on fixes for the exploit.
