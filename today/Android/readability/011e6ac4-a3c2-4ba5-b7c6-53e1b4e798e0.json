Motorola might not be trying to go toe-to-toe with the most iconic devices in the flagship tiers of the smartphone market, but if there's one place that it has done a good job cementing its presence, that's in the budget category. Today, the company has just announced three new devices for those looking for reliable devices that are still affordable. 2024 is almost over, but just in the nick of time, Motorola brings the Moto G05, Moto G15, and the Moto E15. Let's talk about them. Moto G05, Marketed For Content Creators On A Budget Let's start by talking about the Moto G05. It's a pretty standard device on all fronts so there's very little to hold against it. It comes with an impressive display for its tier—a 6.7-inch LCD with a 90Hz refresh rate and 1,000-nit peak brightness (that's impressive for a budget phone, and the highest in its class according to Motorola). With that display, any content you make with the 50MP camera on the back can be properly scrutinized (annoyingly, that second “lens” only holds a sensor). The stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos will also help in that regard. And if you're going to be editing that same content on your G05, the Helio G81 Extreme, as much as 8GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of expandable storage will help in that regard. The battery in this is a modest 5,200mAh unit with support for 18W fast charging. You also get a headphone jack as you might expect, and an 8MP selfie cam. It's pretty hard to tell the Moto G15 apart from the G05, particularly on paper. Physically, the phone looks pretty similar, though the illusion of three cameras is the biggest distinction. In reality, you're really only getting one extra camera, which is a 5MP ultrawide. On the front is the same 8MP unit as the G05. Just like the G05, you get a Helio G81 Extreme chip, options for 4GB and 8GB of RAM, and either 128GB or 256GB of storage (the G05 has a 64GB option though). You still get expandable storage and a headphone jack. The screen remains the same size at 6.7 inches but only has a 60Hz refresh rate. Again though, the battery is the same 5,200mAh capacity with 18W wired charging support. Motorola also unveiled the G15 Power, which comes with a 6,000mAh battery, 30W charging, and a single 8/256GB storage configuration. Everything else remains the same. Moto E15, A Budget Phone For The Bare Minimum Compared to the other phones, the Moto E15 cuts down on a lot, clearly aiming for a much cheaper price point with the number of cut corners. It has a 6.7-inch LCD with support for up to 1,000 nits. Motorola did splurge on a 90Hz display though. You get the same Helio G81 Extreme processor, 5,200mAh battery, and 18W fast charging. However, the device only comes in a single 2/64GB configuration, so it won't be the one for many. You get a 3.5mm headphone jack and a microSD slot—after all, these have inexplicably become budget offerings. The camera gets stepped down to a 32MP module with a “fake” second camera. The front shooter is the same 8MP unit as the other phones. This device doesn't come with NFC, unlike the others, so keep that in mind. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post Next Post",
