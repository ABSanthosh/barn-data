  "text": "Apple recently announced the launch of a couple of new iPad models, which include the new M3-powered iPad Air, as well as the more affordable 11th-generation iPad, which starts at just $349. This continues the trend of Apple’s base iPad model being the most budget-friendly way to get into its software ecosystem, with decent performance and specs to boost. READ: Meet the NXTPAPER 11 Plus, TCL’s Newest Tablet Despite being a newly-launched device however, the iPad 11 still lacks support for Apple Intelligence, which in a way serves as a reminder from Apple that you didn’t spend enough to get those premium AI features, some of which are still not available despite big promises from Apple a year ago. That’s because the iPad 11 only comes with the Apple A16 chip and 6GB of RAM, while Apple Intelligence requires – at the very least – an A17 Pro chipset and 8GB of RAM. Of course given the state that Apple Intelligence is currently in, we wouldn’t blame most consumers who don’t see Apple’s AI-based software features as much of a priority, especially when choosing a device to spend their money on. READ: You Can Now Buy a “De-Googled” Version of the Pixel Tablet At its core however, you’re still getting a capable tablet with the iPad 11 – there’s a sharp display resolution of 1640 x 2360 pixels, double the storage this time at 128GB for the base model, 4K video recording, and decent battery capacity at 28.93 Wh. It’s probably safe to say that you’re getting a lot of iPad for less than usual, as long as AI isn’t a dealbreaker for you.
