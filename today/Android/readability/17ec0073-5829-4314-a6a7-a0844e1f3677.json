It can be used on the web at meta.ai as well as in WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram, by just tapping the Meta AI icon or typing \"@Meta AI\" to make it your conversation partner. It has a range of AI voices, can identify details in photos, edit images, generate creative captions, and also - of course - generate images. Naturally, you can also ask it questions about anything. Meta boasts that Meta AI is on track to become the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year, when it should have almost 500 million active users monthly. Meta AI has also rolled out to the Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the UK and Australia today with voice support only for now. Source",
