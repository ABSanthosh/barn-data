  "text": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 series might be one of the most anticipated smartphone series of 2025, and the best part is that we only need to wait less than two weeks before the devices become official. Like clockwork, the closer a smartphone's release is, the more the leaks start to pour in, and that's the case for Samsung's next big launch. We've just seen the largest leak, exposing official images of the devices in multiple colors as well as the spec sheets. Samsung's Galaxy S25 Series Looks Good But Very Little Has Changed Samsung is gearing up to launch the S25 lineup on January 22nd, and we're looking forward to that. However, for those of us who are impatient, we're lucky to be around for a major leak. This brings insight into some of the colorways as well as a low-down on the specs. These are both coming in courtesy of Android Headlines. However, just remember that the specs should be taken with a pinch of salt, though they sound as expected. Very little is going to change, so don't expect a massive upgrade. Samsung Galaxy S25 Image: Evan Blass The Samsung Galaxy S25 is going to be the little guy in Samsung's flagship lineup for 2025, and it will supposedly come in even smaller than the “Mini” phones from some Chinese OEMs. It is expected to have a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and FHD+ resolution. To break that down, it's not different from last year. Inside, there'll be a Snapdragon 8 Elite with 12GB of RAM (goodbye to 8GB of RAM) and a choice of 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB of storage. The battery will be 4,000mAh, which is small, considering the competition, and you'll still have to make do with 25W wired charging. A 50MP primary camera, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP 3x telephoto, and 12MP selfie camera will show up, same as last year. The device will measure 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm and will weight 162 grams, so it'll be both lighter and thinner than its predecessor. It'll be available in Iceblue, Mint, Navy, and Silver Shadow colorways. Samsung Galaxy S25+ Image: Evan Blass If this year is anything like the last, the Galaxy S25+ might be the best value option if you don't mind losing a higher-end telephoto module and the S Pen. It'll have a large 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with WQHD resolution and 120Hz refresh. The Snapdragon 8 Elite will power the phone, along with 12GB of RAM. It will only be available in 256GB and 512GB storage options and will get a much larger 4,900mAh battery with 45W wired charging. The same camera setup as the vanilla model, a 50MP primary, 12MP ultrawide, and 10MP 3x telephoto will be present; with a 12MP selfie camera on the front. The phone will have dimensions of 158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm and will weigh 190 grams. Again, that's lighter and thinner than the S24+. It will be available in the same Iceblue, Silver Shadow, Mint, and Navy colorways. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Image: Evan Blass The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is almost certainly the most heavily-anticipated phone of the bunch. It'll be the only one to get a notable design change, though it is only a minor rounding of the usual sharp corners that the Ultra model has gotten used to. Besides that, expect a slightly larger 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with WQHD resolution and 120Hz refresh. The Snapdragon 8 Elite shows up, with 12GB of RAM and the choice of 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB of storage. It'll have a 5,000mAh battery and 45W wired charging returns as the company's max, dating back to 2019's Note 10+. You will get a 200MP primary camera with an all-new 50MP ultrawide camera. There'll be a 10MP 3x telephoto along with a 50MP 5x periscope telephoto. A 12MP selfie camera will be on the front. The device will measure 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2 mm and will weigh 218 grams. That makes it thinner and notably lighter than its predecessor. It'll come in Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Silver Blue, and Titanium White Silver colorways. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes.",
