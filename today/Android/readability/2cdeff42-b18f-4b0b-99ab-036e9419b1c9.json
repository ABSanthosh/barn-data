  "text": "It’s been a while since we’ve seen a dedicated Windows-powered tablet on the market, and it looks like this is a space that ASUS wants to fill with its newest launch, which it dubs the ROG Flow Z13. A 2-in-1 machine, the Flow Z13 packs a punch in terms of performance, without skimping on what makes a gaming tablet, well, a gaming tablet. Up front you’ll find what ASUS describes as a “compact” 13-inch display (we’re not quite sure about that) that features a 2.5K resolution, as well as a 180Hz refresh rate and 100% DCI-P3 color coverage. This screen is wrapped in a sleek-looking unibody chassis that’s made from CNC aluminium, and packs a built-in kickstand. Inside is where things get interesting – the tablet is available with a configuration that rungs on AMD’s Ryzen AI Max+ 395 alongside 128GB of unified memory. It’s also powered by a 70Wh battery that ASUS says will be enough for up to 10 hours of continuous usage. It also features a built-in stainless steel vapor chamber and new Arc Flow Fans for better heat dissipation even under heavy loads. As it is a Windows tablet, it will be able to run a suite of different Microsoft apps in addition to a wide selection of PC apps and games, as well as Microsoft’s new Ai features via its Copilot AI system. As for pricing, the ROG Flow Z13 a bit on the expensive side however – getting one will cost you around 2,000 USD, which is definitely something to consider should you be interested in buying one.
