It gets a slightly modified design over its predecessor alongside a few key specs upgrades. These are our first impressions. There's nothing eventful in the retail box – a simple USB-C cable, a SIM ejector tool and some paperwork. Galaxy A26 brings Samsung's new camera design with a camera island arrangement. The back is made from glass and it features Gorilla Glass Victus+ protection. Our review unit sports the fresh Mint color which falls right in line with the spring season. There's a slightly larger 6.7-inch Super AMOLED display with FHD+ resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. The side bezels are noticeably slimmer than on the Galaxy A25 though Samsung re-used the older waterdrop notch design for the 13MP selfie cam instead of going for a more elegant punch-hole. The display also protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+, and speaking of protection, Samsung finally brought IP67 water and dust resistance to its A2X series. The A26 gets Samsung’s Exynos 1380 chipset, which was found on last year's Galaxy A35 and a handful of previous-gen Galaxy A, M and F series phones. There’s a 50MP main cam around the back alongside an 8MP ultrawide lens and a 2MP macro shooter. The battery remains unchanged at 5,000 mAh as does the 25W charging. A quick word on software, we're running One UI 7 based on Android 15 out of the box and Samsung is promising up to 6 Android OS upgrades and 6 years of security patches, which is nice to see on a more affordable device like this. Our review team is proceeding with the usual set of tests, so expect our detailed review in due time. Samsung Galaxy A26",
