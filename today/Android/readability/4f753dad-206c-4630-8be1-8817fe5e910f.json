A lot of us don't care too much about the politics behind the smartphones that we use. I'm not saying that's a good or bad thing, but for many, all that matters is that the device delivers the specs that we want at the price that we want. Everything else tends to be secondary. However, for the people who do prioritize the ethics behind their smartphones or those who want devices that they can easily repair on their own, there's a market for you. Fairphone is the most notable “honestly made” smartphone brand, and nearly two years after its last device, we get to see what its Fairphone 6 is going to look like. The Fairphone 6 Has Had an Image Leaked, Showing a Revised Design Image: WinFuture In almost every modern global industry, a lot is going on. For the consumers, a lot stays in the shadows, and you simply stay uninformed about any ethical issues that might be occurring at any point during production. Some people don't like that and actually want to make sure that the companies they patronize aren't adding to the problem. Fairphone is a company that does that, building devices in the most responsible way possible. The company's last smartphone was the Fairphone 5, released in August 2023, and nearly two years later, word has leaked that we can expect the Fairphone 6 to arrive by the end of this month—June 25th, to be exact. Thanks to the people over at WinFuture, we know a lot more than the launch date. First, there's a leaked image, though only from a front angle, showing off a slightly modified design. The Fairphone 6 adopts a flat frame, which is more modern, and the buttons are flat as well. We can see the power button on the side, beneath a bright yellow key that might be a slider of some kind, potentially to lock the device's back panel. The Fairphone 6 Will Have a Relatively Respectable Storage Configuration Image: Fairphone If you're getting the Fairphone 6, it isn't because you want a device that will tear through Genshin Impact at 120fps. You have other concerns. The RAM and storage are among the info that's been leaked, and we know the phone will have 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which is respectable enough. Fairphone 6 (Rumored)RAM8GBStorage256GBColorsHorizon Black, Cloud White, Forest GreenPricing€549 It is also expected to use a modular design on the back, with two back panels that support modular accessories. Those accessories will include a lanyard, a card holder, and a ring to hold the device more easily. The device will be a little more expensive than its predecessor's starting price, but cheaper than the same 8/256GB configuration of the Fairphone 5 (€579). The Fairphone 6 Will Remain Incredibly Repairable Image: Fairphone Another aspect of Fairphone's brand is making devices that are always very easy to repair by yourself. That doesn't change here. You will be able to replace the following parts of the phone by yourself, and without much hassle: Battery USB-C port Display Earpiece Camera Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast.
