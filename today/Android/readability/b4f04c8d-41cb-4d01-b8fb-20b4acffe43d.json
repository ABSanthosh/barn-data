Learn more. 2025 is the year smartphone manufacturers look beyond performance and design to tease new ways you can use your device. At the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona, Infinix revealed many major innovations that will rock the industry: SolarEnergy-Reserving Technology and E-Color Shift 2.0. SolarEnergy-Reserving Technology introduces a concept where smartphones and phone cases can use ambient light to extend battery life. Meanwhile, E-Color Shift 2.0 builds on the brand's AI-powered customization to allow you personalize your device's appearance dynamically. Here's how they both work and how they change your experience Infinix launches Chameleon Phone Concept I once wondered if phone backs could be more than just static panels and be something interactive. You could control what your phone looks like and when it changes, as opposed to using a case. Now with Infinix introducing E-Color Shift 2.0, I feel validated. Phone backs no longer have to be boring, and can be your canvas for creativity. The technology brings six patterns and six color palettes that you can use to create up to 30 unique combinations. Artificial intelligence then helps you adapt the phone’s back cover based on exposure to sunlight. It's nothing particularly new, and Infinix did introduce it years back on the Concept Phone 2021. It's nice to know that it may become mainstream soon. Image: Infinix On the other hand, Extreme-Temp Battery will help batteries work in extreme temperatures, particularly in very cold conditions where regular lithium-ion batteries struggle. It's a well-known problem where the chemical reactions inside the battery slow down and reduce its ability to hold and deliver power efficiently. You'll notice your phone losing charge much quicker than usual and sudden shutdowns. Note 50 Series out in Indonesia In addition to the mentioned innovations, Infinix is manipulating that same solar-based model to enable phone charging through light rays. Devices can capture energy not just from sunlight but also from indoor lighting and turn it into electricity with the help of a special case. It transfers the energy wirelessly to the phone through small contact points. Right now, it can store up to 2W of power, but future versions could improve on it. Image: Infinix The company says that the idea was inspired by how sunflowers turn toward sunlight. AI has a hand in adjusting the way it collects and transfers energy, depending on where your phone is and how much light is available. But it works best within three meters of a light source. Beyond the new concept technologies, Infinix has launched the Note 50 series in Indonesia. A wider rollout should happen towards the end of March. The Infinix Note 50 and Note 50 Pro come with a 6.78-inch AMOLED display that supports a 144Hz refresh rate and reaches a peak brightness of 1300 nits.  Image: Infinix They run on the MediaTek Helio G100 Ultimate chipset. The standard Note 50 offers 8GB of RAM with 256GB of storage, while the Pro version is available in 8GB+256GB and 12GB+256GB configurations. Both of them share support for virtual RAM expansion and a 5,200mAh battery. Irene is an experienced writer with four years in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.
