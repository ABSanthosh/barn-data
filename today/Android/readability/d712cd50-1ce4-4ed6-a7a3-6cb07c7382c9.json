  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account If you're looking to save some money on your current wireless plan, there's a pretty good chance you'll be able to do that by moving to an MVNO. And while there are plenty of carriers to choose from, we think that Mint Mobile delivers some of the best prices, while also providing excellent coverage and performance. Mint Mobile is a value-focused MVNO that runs off T-Mobile's 5G network in the US. It differentiates itself from the competition by offering wholesale discounts for its service — you buy multiple months of service at a time and pay less per month as a result. Mint Mobile was partially owned by Ryan Reynolds, before T-Mobile acquired the MVNO earlier in 2024. Mint Mobile offers some of the best prices in the MVNO space, but its latest promotion takes things to another level, dropping its unlimited plan to just $15/month. Now, this isn't just for a month, or a few months, but you'll be able to get a year of service for just $15/month, which comes out to be an absolute steal. Excellent value for just $15/month As far as the details go, this is an unlimited plan without any data caps, which means you're free to binge-watch all your favorite shows, and listen to all your favorite tunes while on the go, without having to worry that you'll run out of data. Mint Mobile is also throwing in 10GB of hotspot data as well, just in case you need to tether to another device. Related Perhaps the only catch is that you need to be a new Mint Mobile customer in order to take advantage of this promotion, and you also need to pay for the year of service in advance, which comes out to be $180. For the most part, there's not much to lose here, considering how expensive phone plans can be from other carriers like Verizon, AT\u0026T, and T-Mobile. While we don't think coverage is going to be an issue since Mint Mobile is running on T-Mobile's nationwide network, just be sure to double-check your coverage area before you sign up. If everything looks good, grab this deal while you can because this promotion won't be around for long.",
