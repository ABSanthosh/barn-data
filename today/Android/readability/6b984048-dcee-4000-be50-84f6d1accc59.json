You will need to install a software update in order to make the feature work on your Honor device. George Zhao, CEO of Honor, said: Enhancements in AI are transforming the way we work, learn, shop, create and interact with our devices. Whether you need translation assistance, homework help or simply want to find out more about an image that’s caught your eye on social media, our smartphones have become our go-to source for searching for this information. As a human-centric technology brand, Honor is committed to bringing the benefits of AI to all. Thanks to our close industry collaboration with Google and by introducing this feature to not one, but two of our popular smartphone lines, it’s now possible to unlock a world of information at your fingertips, offering a whole new level of convenience in people’s daily lives.",
