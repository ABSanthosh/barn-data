The new TVs come equipped with the company’s latest display tech, as well as a host of AI-powered software features that come baked into the TVs. AI is a major feature that LG’s highlighting this year, and the new TVs come with an integrated α (Alpha) 11 AI processor Gen2, which allows the hardware to run AI features. This includes “AI Welcome” which gives curated content recommendations based on a user’s viewing habits, and there’s even a voice-powered “AI Voice ID” that can recognize individual user voices and automatically switch profiles based on who’s currently watching. There’s even a built-in AI Chatbot feature and a Generative Image Gallery that works with voice commands. READ: LG’s New Projector doesn’t Even Look like a Projector at All Inside you’ll find LG’s webOS interface, which serves as the main software platform that allows users to access streaming services such as Netflix, Prime Video and more. It also supports multi-platform compatibility with the Home Hub, allowing users to link ThinQ and Google Home controls for supported IoT devices. The new models also feature enhanced brightness with Brightness Booster Ultimate for more vibrant colors and intricate details. Also present are 4K resolution panels with 165Hz refresh rates, reduced input lag, and ClearMR 10000 certification for smoother gaming sessions, and the M5 in particular also brings wireless audio and video transmission at 4K 144Hz. A writer and content creator with a love for tech and music, Mike is also an avid gamer as well. He and his wife are big fans of Mario Kart.
