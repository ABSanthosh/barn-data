READ: Google’s New All-in-One AI Subscription Service Comes with a Hefty Fee With that in mind, the new feature uses Gemini and Google’s Shopping Graph (which covers 50 billion products) for visual inspiration, smart guidance, and accurate product data. One major feature includes a virtual dressing room called “Try it on” where users can try on billions of apparel items on themselves by uploading a photo, which is powered by a new custom image generation model and is able to understand the nuances of clothing on different body sizes and types. https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Try_it_on_Title_page_5.mp4 Users can also access an “agentic checkout” that allows for price-tracking and can even automatically complete purchases when their desired price is met. AI Mode can also understand nuanced requests—like finding a “cute travel bag” suitable for rainy weather—by performing multiple simultaneous searches. As for availability, Google says that the new shopping tools are rolling out in the U.S. in the coming months. A writer and content creator with a love for tech and music, Mike is also an avid gamer as well. He and his wife are big fans of Mario Kart.
