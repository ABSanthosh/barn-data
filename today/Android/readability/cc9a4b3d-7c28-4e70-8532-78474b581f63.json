The phones offer a new dedicated key called Essential Key and a new hub called Essential Space. Nothing describes it as the “second memory” of your smartphone. Here is everything you need to know about Nothing’s Essential Space and Essential Key. Essential Space is an AI-powered application that serves as a hub for all your screenshots and notes taken using the Essential Key. This hub makes it easier to organize and go through screen grabs and notes. Since the app has AI integration, it is also able to analyze your screenshots and transcribe voice notes to offer contextual information and actions. It eliminates clutter from your phone’s gallery as no more screenshots without any context or meaning to them. How to Use Essential Space? The first thing you need to know is that Essential Key is a new physical button on the right side of the Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro. Its placement is closer to the power button. Press Essential Key once to capture screenshot or click photo when using the native camera app. Long-press the button to start recording a voice note and add your thoughts about the screenshot. Double press the button anytime to access Essential Space. One of the best things about Essential Space is that it can send reminders and offer actions based on what you have saved. For example, it can alert you about an upcoming flight if you captured the boarding pass. You can get reminders for an upcoming sale or expiry date for an item/event.
