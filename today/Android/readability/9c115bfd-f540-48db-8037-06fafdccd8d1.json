The company also has to eliminate the 'scare screens' it shows users before letting them use third-party payment providers for iOS apps. Spotify and Amazon are already making changes to their apps to reflect the new situation, so now you can pay for your purchases and subscriptions outside of the App Store without any 'Apple Tax'.",
