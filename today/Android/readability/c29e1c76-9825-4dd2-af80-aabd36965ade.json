  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Google Messages remains one of the best texting apps on Android. In fact, with RCS on the iPhone, RCS usage has increased significantly. Google keeps tweaking the app's UI, introducing subtle changes now and then. While the company has been experimenting with a Material 3 Expressive redesign, it's also continuing to refine the UI used by stable users. Related In June, Google rolled out a UI change in Messages that combined the camera and gallery buttons into one. Tapping it opened a new view with the camera feed on top and recent gallery photos below. Users could swipe up to access their full gallery, but the change made the process more cumbersome. Many on social media criticized this layout — some didn't want to see the camera every time, while others found accessing the gallery had become a two-step task. Google Messages just undid one of its most annoying UI changes Thankfully, Google has responded to user feedback and is reportedly reverting to the old layout with separate buttons for camera and gallery. Some Reddit users report that tapping the '+' icon in a chat now shows two distinct buttons for 'Camera' and 'Gallery' (via 9to5Google). As before, these appear first in the action tray before options like GIFs, Stickers, and Magic Compose. Related The combined camera/gallery shortcut still exists but now sits in the text field next to the emoji icon, for those who prefer the new UI. But, at least now, users have a choice. The change doesn't appear to be rolling out widely yet. I don't see the new UI on my Google Pixel 9, even on the latest Messages beta (version 20250713). It's possible Google is still testing the UI again based on user feedback. If the rollout expands, we'll keep you posted.",
