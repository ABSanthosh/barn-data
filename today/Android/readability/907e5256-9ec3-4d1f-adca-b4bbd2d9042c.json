There were rumors right before the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 16 series releases claiming that the Ultra would either replace the Pro Max or sit above it. Now, the very same rumor is back.

According to a report on the Naver blog, the upcoming iPhone 17 Ultra will replace the Pro Max. The claim stems from supply chain market analysis, suggesting that Apple is preparing to launch a phone with new hardware features. For instance, the Ultra will likely adopt a smaller Dynamic Island, and given the amount of orders, it's not enough to cover both the Pro and Ultra. The report also suggests that the Ultra will be the only one to adopt a vapor chamber cooling system, and it will feature a larger battery than last year's Pro Max. As a result, it will be thicker too. It may sound like a stretch to some, but keep in mind that Apple has been using the Ultra designation for some of its products, like the Apple Watch Ultra or the M3 Ultra chip. Additionally, offering an iPhone Ultra with a substantial hardware upgrade gives Apple leeway to hike the phone's price and potentially increase profit margins too. Still, it's a bit early to tell if the report is correct, but we will monitor the story as it progresses. Source",
