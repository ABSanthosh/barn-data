One of the key differences between the two was that the Pro was a 5G phone with the Dimensity 8200 Ultimate chip, while the vanilla model only had 4G connectivity with the Helio G99 Ultimate. Then came the Camon 30S Pro, which was a 4G alternative to the 30 Pro with the Helio G100. This concludes the history lesson and brings us to the Tecno Camon 30S.

One of the key differences between the two was that the Pro was a 5G phone with the Dimensity 8200 Ultimate chip, while the vanilla model only had 4G connectivity with the Helio G99 Ultimate. Then came the Camon 30S Pro, which was a 4G alternative to the 30 Pro with the Helio G100. This concludes the history lesson and brings us to the Tecno Camon 30S. Like the S Pro, this is a 4G phone with the G100 chip. Available configurations include 6/128GB, 8/128GB and 8/256GB with virtual RAM available to double the RAM capacity. The S Pro introduced two key changes compared to the regular Pro – a curved display and an IP rating. The Camon 30S follows suit and has a curved 6.78” FHD+ OLED display (120Hz). The display can reach 1,300 nits in high brightness mode and uses 2,160Hz PWM dimming. It is a 10-bit panel with 100% coverage of the DCI-P3 color space. For protection, there is Gorilla Glass (version unknown). As mentioned, the new phone has dust and water resistance – it is rated IP53 and the touchscreen can work with wet fingers. The rear camera remains at 50MP with a 1/1.56” sensor (Sony IMX896) and OIS. It is joined by a 2MP depth sensor and a dual-LED flash. Actually, the selfie camera also has a dual-LED flash. It is punched into the display and has a 13MP sensor, not 50MP like on the 30S Pro. Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos • 5,000mAh battery with 33W charging The Camon 30S is equipped with stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. However, it doesn’t have a 3.5mm headphone jack, a downgrade from the original 30. Another downgrade is that the battery charge rate has been reduced to 33W, while the battery capacity is the same at 5,000mAh. This makes the 30S the slowest of the bunch when it comes to charging (the Camon 30 did 70W). The phone features some color-changing magic. For example, the Blue colorway goes from light purple to dark blue when exposed to sunlight. There is also a Nebula Violet (which appears more light purple in the dark), as well as Celestial Black and Dawn Gold. Tecno Camon 30S in Blue, Nebula Violet, Celestial Black and Dawn Gold The Tecno Camon 30S is available now in Pakistan. Only one configuration shows up on the online store, the top 8/256GB option, which is priced at PKR 60,000 (this converts to $215/£165/€200). It’s available in three colors (the color-changing Blue is missing). We also spotted the 30S in Kenya and Mali, however, it doesn’t appear to be on sale yet. We tried looking for third-party retailers that might carry the 30S, but no luck (not yet, anyway). Thanks for the tip, Haroon! Source",
