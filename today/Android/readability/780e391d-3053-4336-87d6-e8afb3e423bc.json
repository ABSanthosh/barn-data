Titled Gears of War: Reloaded, the upcoming title is scheduled for a summer release and features enhanced graphics, as well as optimization for different platforms. READ: An Xbox handheld gaming console could be right around the corner The biggest surprise with Reloaded however is that it’s also coming to the PlayStation 5, PC, and Steam, something that would have been entirely unheard of years ago. The Gears of War franchise has long been seen by many as one of Microsoft’s biggest exclusives, alongside the likes of Halo. Part of Microsoft’s official announcement reads: …As we approach the 20th anniversary of Gears of War in 2026, we’re reflecting on what this franchise means. It’s about the stories we’ve told, the friendships we’ve built, and the unforgettable moments we’ve shared together. With Gears of War: Reloaded, we’re opening that door to more players than ever. The game will launch on August 26 for $39.99, and will be available day one with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass. Additionally, Gears of War: Reloaded will feature Xbox Play Anywhere support for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox PC, and Xbox Cloud Gaming, alongside full cross-play and cross-progression integration. Finally, players who own the digital version of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition will receive a complimentary upgrade to Gears of War: Reloaded.",
