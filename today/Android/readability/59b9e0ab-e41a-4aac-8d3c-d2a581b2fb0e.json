There's been a lot of crying about Samsung's massive delay in releasing One UI 7, its take on Android 15. While most manufacturers had things ready before 2024 closed out, Samsung has still been delaying things to a pretty extraordinary extent. At the moment, it hasn't pushed a stable version of One UI 7 to any of its older smartphones. For the first time, we finally have what could be an accurate look at when we can expect stable One UI 7 to launch on Samsung's entire portfolio that's eligible for the update. While we might have to wait a bit longer, it's nice to have a much better idea of what we should mark on our calendars. Samsung Will Start Releasing One UI 7 to Older Devices Starting In April Image: Peter Holden/Talk Android Before we break down the actual schedule, let's start by saying that this information comes courtesy of a tip sent by a reader to GSMArena. The image is sourced from a Samsung workshop, providing the devices getting One UI 7 and the respective dates that the rollout will begin. It probably doesn't need to be said, but take all of this with a pinch of salt. Now, February is almost over, and March is right around the corner. Sadly, you shouldn't expect anything other than betas in the entire month of March. According to the screenshot, April is the earliest that any phone is going to get the update. Image: GSMArena On April 18th, the Samsung Galaxy S24 family will be the very first in line, as expected. That includes the S24 FE. However, on that date, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 will also get stable One UI 7 pushed out to them. The only other notable date in April is April 25th, which is when the second batch of phones will get the update. That includes the Galaxy S23 family (excluding the S23 FE), the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Z Fold 5, and the midrange Galaxy A54. Oddly, the A35 and A55 don't show up on the list. Some Samsung Devices Will Need to Wait Until Late May Image: Samsung As a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra owner, I've been waiting for news of the One UI 7 update. I'm glad that I finally have an idea of when to expect it to roll out to my phone. Samsung has two rollout batches planned for May. The first of the two will be on May 16th. It's only then that Samsung's Galaxy S23 FE will join the rest of its family with One UI 7. It's also when the entire flagship S22 lineup (yay), and Z Flip 4 and Z Fold 4 will get blessed. The Galaxy A34, as well as the A33 and A53 from two years ago, will join the party too. Image: Samsung The final date is May 23rd, which is solely for the Z Flip 3, Z Fold 3, and the S21 family. That means it will take roughly three months from now before Samsung has completed its One UI 7 rollout. Better late than never, but Android 16 will be launched pretty soon after that. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
