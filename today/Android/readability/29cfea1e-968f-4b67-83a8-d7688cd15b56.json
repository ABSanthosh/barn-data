When it comes to the devices in Samsung's lineup that we're all used to, things don't seem set to be very exciting. The S25, S25+, and the S25 Ultra aren't going to change drastically. Samsung thinks it's fine and what Samsung thinks is what matters in the end. However, a fourth model was bound to bring some excitement to Unpacked in January. The Galaxy S25 Slim has been rumored for some time and it is almost certain that it exists with the number of leaks that have come out surrounding it. It seemed like all four models would be made official on January 22nd, but now it seems like the S25 Slim won't be joining the rest for release. New Info Points To The Galaxy S25 Slim Being Launched Sometime After January Image: OnLeaks x Android Headlines The Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to be a very different phone for Samsung. The last time that it did something that was vastly different was back when it launched the original Z Fold, and even then, it was only following the trend that had been started by the Royole Flexpai. So, prioritizing thinness in 2025 with a Slim model is definitely a distinct move. However, if you were really hoping to get your first official glimpse at the S25 Slim‘s pricing and spec list in January, it doesn't look like that's going to happen. Image: Samsung This is all based on certain pieces of information that have been dug up from inside the code of the One UI 7 beta, and we have AssembleDebug and Android Authority to thank for uncovering that. The beta's code has model numbers for only three S25 variants: SM-S931, SM-S936, and SM-S938. Those correspond with the S25, S25+, and the S25 Ultra. The GSMA IMEI database also added those three some time ago, with an “SM-S937” only being added sometime later, potentially indicating a later launch. The mystery device, with a model number between the Plus and Ultra, should be the Slim. The Galaxy S25 Slim Could Still Be Teased At Samsung Unpacked Image: Samsung It looks like Samsung's Slim model won't be launching for consumers at Samsung Unpacked next month, but that doesn't mean that it isn't going to show up at all. In fact, I feel like the company will still tease the device on January 22nd, unless it plans to take it down the Fold SE route and limit its regional availability. The company is also likely to tease its Project Moohan headset, which will be the first device to run on Android XR, as well as the Galaxy Ring 2. One more teaser wouldn't be entirely out of place. The Galaxy S25 Slim Might Be Released In Q2 2025 Image: OnLeaks x Android Headlines There's no exact word on when the S25 Slim will eventually come out, but the second quarter of the year seems like a good guess. It gives enough time for the typical trio of the S25 series to sell as many as they can, and after the steam runs out a little bit, the S25 Slim can come in to revitalize the energy. The device is expected to use ALoP technology for a smaller camera bump, have an “Ultra”-grade camera, and achieve sub-7mm thickness. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
