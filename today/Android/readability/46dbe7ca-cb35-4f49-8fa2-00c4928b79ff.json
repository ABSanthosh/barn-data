Fairphone 6 in Forest Green The Fairphone 6 has an easily removable lower back cover which makes the battery accessible for quick removal - although this isn't glued, you will have to remove some screws to get it out. Other components that are easy to replace include all three cameras, the display, and the module housing the speaker and USB port at the bottom. Interestingly, you'll be able to order a lower back cover in whatever color you want, so you could pair a white phone with a green cover or something like that if you wanted. Fairphone 6 in Horizon Black The device has a 6.31-inch P-OLED LTPO screen with 1-120Hz refresh rate, the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 SoC at the helm, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of expandable storage, and a 4,415 mAh battery with support for 33W wired charging. Fairphone 6 in Cloud White There's also a fingerprint sensor embedded into the power button, and IP55 certification for dust and water resistance. The phone is rumored to cost €550.
