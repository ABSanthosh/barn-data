READ: Meet Oppo’s Newest Midrange Tablet Aside from a new green color model, the China-exclusive OnePlus Pad packs the same design and specs as seen on its Oppo counterpart – this includes the Dimensity 8350 chipset inside, the same 11.61-inch IPS screen with a 2000 x 2,800 pixel aspect ratio, a 9,520 mAh battery with 67W charging support, and options for either 8GB or 12GB RAM variants. As with most tablets on the market, you get two cameras – an 8MP shooter for selfies and video calls, and another 8MP lens on the rear of the tablet. It stays pretty affordable as well, going for as much as $275 (when converted). Given that it’s a China-exclusive device however, the odds of seeing it in other markets might be unlikely.
