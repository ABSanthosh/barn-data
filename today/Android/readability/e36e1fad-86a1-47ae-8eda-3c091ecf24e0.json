  "text": "There has always been a lot of speculation about whether pre-built PCs are worth it. Yes, it is probably easier for the general user or office worker to buy a pre-built system. However, once you start needing a bit more from your PC, whether it be for gaming or audio/video editing, a pre-built may not be the best option for you. Enthusiasts are always saying not to buy pre-built PCs, and in a lot of cases, they are right. With pre-built PCs, you normally pay a bit extra for the components used to build them and a potential builders' fee. You also can't guarantee all the components inside and may end up with cheap cooling, power supply, motherboard, or more. While not all businesses do, many need to find a way to cut corners to make money, hence using cheaper components. 3 Upgrade your current PC Save money and e-waste The great thing about most modern PCs is that they can be upgraded. Depending on your needs or what issues you are facing with your current PC, you may need to upgrade a few different components to reach your desired outcome. Your PC's age will also play a part in how many components you will need to upgrade. A lot of components are also compatible with other components across multiple generations. For instance, DDR5 RAM can be compatible with many different motherboards that work with Intel or AMD CPUs. The same goes for power supplies. They can be used across a wide range of systems. If you want to upgrade, once you figure out the new components you want or need, it is worth checking which of your older components can be salvaged and used again with the new ones. Related Most enthusiasts should never buy a NAS, here's what you should use instead Grabbing an off the shelf NAS is easy, but here's what every enthusiast should do instead 2 Get someone to build your custom PC for you If you're not confident enough to do it yourself Getting someone to build a PC for you, whether a friend or a shop, can be a great way to get the PC you want. You can have complete control over choosing the components that make up the PC. The only real downside is that you may still have to pay a builders' fee, which will be a bit more expensive than if you do it yourself. This option still bypasses the number one issue with pre-built PCs: not knowing 100% what components you are getting and if they are cheap. Getting a custom-built PC ensures you get the quality of components you want and will allow you to make sure you know 100% of what is being used. Many shops also offer a warranty, so if anything goes wrong, you can simply bring it in instead of trying to figure it out yourself. 1 Build your own DIY is the preferred way to go Building your own PC may seem daunting, but almost anyone can do it with the correct guidance. The biggest issue you will run into is ensuring all your components are compatible before purchasing them. Once you have done this, the act of putting them all together is straightforward and really doesn't take too long at all. Building your own PC will let you customize it how you want, ensuring you get the best PC for your needs. Whether you need extra storage or a better GPU for more graphically intense tasks, building your own PC allows you the freedom to choose exactly what you need. Once you have built your own, there is also a great feeling of accomplishment. I don't know what it is, but knowing you did it yourself makes using it much more enjoyable. Related Hardcore DIY enthusiasts, how do you reduce workspace clutter? Cable management was the bane of my existence when I first started building PCs, and I'm embarrassed to admit that the situation is mostly the same even after a decade. Heck, some of my systems still look like what can be best described as a rat's nest once you remove the back panel. But a more serious problem has popped up these days: my computing workspace looks far worse than the insides of my PCs. For months, I had two full-tower PCs occupying my main desk, which left plenty of room for other peripherals, and switching to monitor arms definitely helped free up some space. However, adding a server PC, a dedicated NAS, and a handful of SBCs has made my workspace a lot more disorganized. Since I use most of my paraphernalia on a daily basis, I can't just lock these devices inside a cupboard. So, here's my question to the DIY gods out there: what arcane arts do you practice to keep your desks free of clutter? Can pre-built PCs be worth it? Yes, they can! However, make sure to look into them properly and know what you are paying for. Many businesses will cheap out on components and list it as an i7 with 4080 GPU but won't mention what generation the i7 CPU is, how old it is, or any details about it. Sites like eBay and Amazon are also flooded with \"Gaming\" pre-built PCs that are simply people trying to scam you and offering up cheap PCs that aren't worth it. While you can sometimes find a good pre-built PC, you must ensure you trust where it comes from. In most cases, if you are not buying from a well-known, reputable seller, it is likely best to just stay away and look for someone to build you a custom PC or even look into building one yourself.",

You can have complete control over choosing the components that make up the PC. The only real downside is that you may still have to pay a builders\u0026#39; fee, which will be a bit more expensive than if you do it yourself.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThis option still bypasses the number one issue with pre-built PCs: not knowing 100% what components you are getting and if they are cheap.

that the situation is mostly the same even after a decade. Heck, some of my systems still look like what can be best described as a rat\u0026#39;s nest once you remove the back panel. But a more serious problem has popped up these days: my computing workspace looks far worse than the insides of my PCs.\n\nFor months, I had two full-tower PCs occupying my main desk, which left plenty of room for other peripherals, and switching to monitor arms definitely helped free up some space. However, adding a server PC, a dedicated NAS, and a handful of SBCs has made my workspace a lot more disorganized. Since I use most of my paraphernalia on a daily basis, I can\u0026#39;t just lock these devices inside a cupboard.

However, make sure to look into them properly and know what you are paying for. Many businesses will cheap out on components and list it as an i7 with 4080 GPU but won\u0026#39;t mention what generation the i7 CPU is, how old it is, or any details about it. Sites like eBay and Amazon are also flooded with \u0026#34;Gaming\u0026#34; pre-built PCs that are simply people trying to scam you and offering up cheap PCs that aren\u0026#39;t worth it.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhile you can sometimes find a good pre-built PC, you must ensure you trust where it comes from. In most cases, if you are not buying from a well-known, reputable seller, it is likely best to just stay away and look for someone to build you a custom PC or even look into building one yourself.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
