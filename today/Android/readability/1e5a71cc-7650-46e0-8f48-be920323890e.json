Meet the Moto Watch Fit, a new and affordable entry which does lose out a bit in terms of features. READ: Motorola’s New Smartwatch Makes a Rather Stealthy Debut The Moto Watch Fit comes with a squared design with a large 1.9-inch OLED screen protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3, and gets pretty bright at up to 1,000 nits of maximum brightness. It also comes with an aluminum design with 5ATM water resistance in addition to IP68 dust and water protection which makes it ideal for outdoor use. One thing to note however is that the Moto Watch Fit doesn’t run on Wear OS, but comes with a more basic RTOS (real-time operating sytem). This means that the device doesn’t support extra apps, and you’re just stuck with the default apps on the watch. It can go for up to 16 days on a single charge though, which is pretty nice. As for features, the Watch Fit can track standard health metrics including heart rate, SpO2, sleep and stress, and comes with over 100 sports modes, along with built-in GPS for tracking activities. It unfortunately lacks a microphone and speakers for calls, which at this point is a common function found on most smartwatches. The Moto Watch Fit launches in May for around $120.",
