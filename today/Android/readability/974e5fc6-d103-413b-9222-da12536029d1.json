It is also claimed to offer improvements in eye protection and an ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner. Previous rumors suggest the panel will measure 6.7-inches and that the phone will launch with Qualcomm’s next gen flagship chipset – the Snapdragon 8 Elite which was previously rumored as the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4. We’re also expecting a 50 MP main camera, 50 MP ultrawide, and a 64 MP telephoto lens. The device should bring a 6,150 mAh battery with 100W fast charging and is expected to debut later this month.
