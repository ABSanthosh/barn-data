Build Version: F966USQU0AYB3/F966UOYN0AYB3/F966USQU0AYB3 It may be One UI 7.0.1, as early rumors say. pic.twitter.com/5uoLUdhQ55— Tarun Vats (@tarunvats33) February 19, 2025 The tipster says it might be labeled One UI 7.0.1, as Samsung has allegedly given up on launching One UI 7.1 since Android 16 is being released early this year. So early, in fact, that it most likely will be launched by Google before Samsung unveils its next-generation foldables, which begs the question: will Samsung release the Galaxy Z Fold7, Flip7, and Flip FE with Android 15 on board even if they arrive a month or two after Android 16 comes out? That wouldn't be a great look for the Korean company, then again it recently hasn't seemed all that concerned with delivering timely updates, so who knows.",
