Realme isn’t exactly a household name overseas yet. But the brand has carved out a strong following in India, Southeast Asia, parts of Europe, and other markets. It's still mostly associated with budget phones or some people don’t even know it at all. But underneath that lowkey branding, they've been running a flashy, spec-packed GT series, and the latest to join its family is the GT 7. The new flagship has been confirmed for an April 23 release in China with a ¥3,000 (≈$410) price tag that's cheaper than the GT 7 Pro's ¥3,699 (≈ $506) tag. Colors for the phone have also been spotted, with the variants including Graphene Ice (blue), Graphene Snow (white), and Graphene Night (black). Here's more information on the upcoming phone release. Realme GT 7 channels the Pro look It’s not often a Pro phone model arrives before its base version. But exactly five months and 19 days since the GT 7 Pro launched, the Realme GT 7 is coming to join the GT lineup. It's going to take a lot of visual cues from its higher sibling with a few subtle downgrades that make it more approachable in design and in pricing. When you look at the chassis, it mirrors the GT 7 Pro’s signature silhouette. But it softens the edges a bit. The Graphene Ice colorway has a red power button and red camera ring accents that make the hardware pop. On the other variants, these parts are golden. Image: Realme The phone itself has a deep matte black appearance with a soft, almost chalky finish that gives it a stone-like texture. The camera cutout is a glossy black square set into the top-left corner. Two large lenses dominate the space while a third, smaller sensor sits neatly beside them. The primary camera should be a 50-megapixel lens backed by optical image stabilization (OIS).  The frame surrounding the sides is flat and gives the phone a boxy shape. On the bottom, there’s a speaker grille, a mic, and a USB-C port. There’s no extra detailing or color splash. According to Realme’s Weibo account, the device roughly has an 8.25mm thin body and weighs 203g. Image: Realme Rumor has it that the phone will come with a BOE-manufactured OLED glass panel at the front with 1.5K resolution and a 144Hz refresh rate. The panel will also have an ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint scanner that's more secure and responds faster than traditional optical scanners. The device is expected to be IP68/69-rated. Related: Realme 13 Pro+ 5G Review Dimensity 9400 Plus and a free headphone await you What truly makes a phone a flagship, for many people, starts with the processor. It’s the brain of the device that dictates how well everything else runs. In today’s market, that usually means a Snapdragon 8 Gen chip or, in the latest wave, the Snapdragon 8 Elite on the GT 7 Pro. The term “flagship” used to be reserved for one ultimate phone per brand. Basically, the best of the best. Now, it’s become more of a marketing category. There are flagships, flagship killers, upper-midrange, premium midrange until the lines have become blurry. Realme sort-of knows that and that's why the GT 7 isn’t necessarily chasing any heavy crowns. Image: Realme It will launch with the Dimensity 9400 Plus, which is MediaTek’s answer to the Snapdragon 8 Elite. It's a high-end chip from MediaTek. It's paired with a huge 7,200mAh battery, 100W fast charging, and bypass charging on the GT 7. More importantly, Realme is running a giveaway tied to the launch, and you may get to walk away with a headphone even if you don't buy the flagship. Simply follow their official Weibo page and forward or share the launch post to enter a draw. Irene is an experienced writer with four years in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.
