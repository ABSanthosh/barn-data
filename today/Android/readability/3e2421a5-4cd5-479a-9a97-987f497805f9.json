  "text": "After months of waiting, Nintendo finally revealed almost everything there is to know about the Switch 2 last week, and it was a wonderful time (until prices were revealed, at least). The Nintendo Switch 2 is the company's best piece of hardware ever, and it improves upon the original in just about every way, making for an even more exciting platform. Of course, Nintendo isn't the only one making a new gaming handheld, and there's plenty to excited about with the prospect of a successor to the Steam Deck as well. But as it stands, there are a few reasons why I'm much more excited about the Switch 2 than I could ever be for the Steam Deck 2. Let's talk about them. Related Steam Deck OLED review: More than just a screen upgrade The Steam Deck OLED dropped by surprise recently, and it's a fantastic handheld that's more than just a screen upgrade. 5 GameChat I probably shouldn't be excited about this, and yet... One of the big reveals Nintendo made during the dedicated Switch 2 Direct on April 2nd was that of GameChat, a new communication feature built right into the operating system on Switch 2. GameChat looks and feels a lot like a Discord competitor, but it's implemented in such a way that makes it much cooler than using Discord on your phone or on your Steam Deck while gaming. GameChat offers not only voice chat, but it also supports a USB camera and screen sharing for all users in a chat session at once. You can be playing a game and constantly be able to keep an eye on your friends, seeing what they're playing or doing so you can help each other and cooperate if needed. It also just helps foster this idea of hanging out in a virtual space as if it was real life, especially because you don't even have to be playing the same games to be in a GameChat session together. You can just be with your friends, playing whatever game you want, and talk about whatever you want. It's a very good idea and it's something you can't really get on a Steam Deck. Sure, Discord is compatible, but it doesn't work in the same way at all when you get down to it. The only drawback for me is that I don't expect to have a lot of friends with a Switch 2, so I don't know how much I'll truly be able to make use of this feature in the first few months and years of the system. But conceptually, it's all there. Related 5 reasons why I'm finally uninstalling Discord After numerous years, I'm finally leaving Discord. 4 Game compatibility It just works Another thing that swings the pendulum in Nintendo's favor is the simple difference between console gaming and PC gaming. As with any PC, the Steam Deck is subject to compatibility issues when trying to run games. Some titles may not be prepared for the relatively low-end hardware and might not function, and others might block Steam Deck players outright, such as Grand Theft Auto Online, due to the lack of anti-cheat support. Sure, the library of games on the Nintendo Switch 2 will be more limited, but when a title is available for sale for the Nintendo Switch 2, you can rest assured it will work on the console, and it will work as well as it was designed to do. You don't have to worry about your specs not being enough, because releases should be optimized to ensure games run as well as they can on that hardware. It just makes it easier to know what you're getting into when buying a game, whereas that may not always be a guarantee with the Steam Deck. You also don't have to mess around with power settings to get the best performance or battery life. Related 4 reasons a Steam Deck shouldn’t replace your dedicated gaming PC We're evaluating why Valve's Steam Deck isn't a worthwhile replacement for a dedicated gaming PC 3 It's still more portable Nintendo still prioritizes portability One of my big fears heading into the Switch 2 is that due to the larger screen and overall size, portability might be compromised. And while the Switch 2 is less portable than the original Switch, it still clears the original Steam Deck, despite having a larger screen. The Nintendo Switch 2 comes in at 1.18 pounds of weight with the Joy-Con 2 attached, which is still significantly less than the 1.47 pounds of the Steam Deck LCD model or 1.41 pounds for the OLED version. It's also not as wide, tall, or thick as the Steam Deck, so portability is still an easy win for the Switch 2. Sure, the Steam Deck 2 may be redesigned, but I highly doubt any of those changes are made to make the device significantly smaller. Most likely, we're looking at faster processors (potentially requiring better cooling) and a bigger, better screen, leading to an even larger handheld overall. Related Big gaming handhelds are ruining the point With gaming handhelds having increasingly bigger screens, the portability is going away. It's time to slow down. 2 The Switch 2 is more flexible out of the box It's a very good deal for what you get Another big selling point for the Switch 2 that I absolutely love is the fact that it's so versatile. We're so used to talking about \"gaming handhelds\" now that it can be easy to forget the Nintendo Switch (and Switch 2) are much more than that. Out of the box, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a handheld console, but it's also a console you can plug into your TV and play on the big screen. You can just remove the controllers and hold one in each hand, or use the included grip for a more traditional controller feeling. Heck, you can even use the controllers as a mouse for more precise controls. All that is included in the box, no extra purchases necessary. The Steam Deck can be similarly versatile, but not really. A dock isn't included with the system, so you have to take the time and money to buy one separately. And if you want to play on the big screen, you'll probably need an external controller or a mouse and keyboard if you want to go that route. It's both a time sink and a significant addition to the cost if you want to get quality peripherals. And it's still not quite as convenient because that additional controller takes up a lot more space if you want to travel with it, whereas the controller on the Switch 2 is just part of the console until you remove it. This flexibility has always made the Switch stand out from other handhelds, and that still holds true. Related 5 ways PC gaming handhelds still can't compete with the Switch PC gaming handhelds have boomed in popularity since the Steam Deck, but it won't be enough to make them outshine the Nintendo Switch. 1 Exclusive Nintendo games The classic argument Any list you might ever read defending a Nintendo platform will come back to this argument, but really, what else can be said? Nintendo's consoles are so popular because the company makes phenomenal games that appeal to all audiences, and it's no different with the Switch 2. So far, we've already seen titles like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza blow people away with their scope, visuals, and the classic Nintendo sense of fun gameplay. Plus, more unique experiences like Drag x Drive and the promise of upcoming games like Kirby Air Riders, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, and more. That's all on top of the Switch 1 games that can be played on Switch 2 as well. Nintendo develops and publishes more games than any other platform holder, and unlike Sony or Microsoft, those games are legitimately exclusive, with virtually no chance of a wider release later. And sure, I'm sure someone will bring up piracy and emulation as options, but most PC gaming handhelds can't even run a lot of Switch games all that smoothly, and with the Switch 2 being as powerful as it is, that's only going to be harder in this new generation. To be fair, there are a lot of PC games that also don't come to Nintendo's platforms, but it's hard to argue against the power of Nintendo's properties. Those are just more popular and generally better games than a lot of those PC exclusives, so it's not really a fair fight. Related I can't wait for the Nintendo Switch 2 If it's not obvious already, I'm very excited about the upcoming launch of the Switch 2, which is less than two months away as I'm writing this article. I'm already set to get the console with the Mario Kart World bundle on day one, and I'll also be getting Donkey Kong Bananza shortly after. And while I'm sure the Steam Deck 2 will be a great device, I'm never going to be as excited for it. I can't wait for June 5th. Related",

You can just be with your friends, playing whatever game you want, and talk about whatever you want.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s a very good idea and it\u0026#39;s something you can\u0026#39;t really get on a Steam Deck. Sure, Discord is compatible, but it doesn\u0026#39;t work in the same way at all when you get down to it. The only drawback for me is that I don\u0026#39;t expect to have a lot of friends with a Switch 2, so I don\u0026#39;t know how much I\u0026#39;ll truly be able to make use of this feature in the first few months and years of the system.

As with any PC, the Steam Deck is subject to compatibility issues when trying to run games. Some titles may not be prepared for the relatively low-end hardware and might not function, and others might block Steam Deck players outright, such as \u003cem\u003eGrand Theft Auto Online\u003c/em\u003e, due to the lack of anti-cheat support.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSure, the library of games on the Nintendo Switch 2 will be more limited, but when a title is available for sale for the Nintendo Switch 2, you can rest assured it will work on the console, and it will work as well as it was designed to do. You don\u0026#39;t have to worry about your specs not being enough, because releases should be optimized to ensure games run as well as they can on that hardware. It just makes it easier to know what you\u0026#39;re getting into when buying a game, whereas that may not always be a guarantee with the Steam Deck. You also don\u0026#39;t have to mess around with power settings to get the best performance or battery life.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n                        \n    \n

And while the Switch 2 is less portable than the original Switch, it still clears the original Steam Deck, despite having a larger screen.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe Nintendo Switch 2 comes in at 1.18 pounds of weight with the Joy-Con 2 attached, which is still significantly less than the 1.47 pounds of the Steam Deck LCD model or 1.41 pounds for the OLED version. It\u0026#39;s also not as wide, tall, or thick as the Steam Deck, so portability is still an easy win for the Switch 2.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSure, the Steam Deck 2 may be redesigned, but I highly doubt any of those changes are made to make the device significantly smaller. Most likely, we\u0026#39;re looking at faster processors (potentially requiring better cooling) and a bigger, better screen, leading to an even larger handheld overall.\u003c/p\u003e            \n

We\u0026#39;re so used to talking about \u0026#34;gaming handhelds\u0026#34; now that it can be easy to forget the Nintendo Switch (and Switch 2) are much more than that. Out of the box, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a handheld console, but it\u0026#39;s also a console you can plug into your TV and play on the big screen. You can just remove the controllers and hold one in each hand, or use the included grip for a more traditional controller feeling. Heck, you can even use the controllers as a mouse for more precise controls. All that is included in the box, no extra purchases necessary.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe Steam Deck \u003cem\u003ecan\u003c/em\u003e be similarly versatile, but not really. A dock isn\u0026#39;t included with the system, so you have to take the time and money to buy one separately. And if you want to play on the big screen, you\u0026#39;ll probably need an external controller or a mouse and keyboard if you want to go that route. It\u0026#39;s both a time sink and a significant addition to the cost if you want to get quality peripherals. And it\u0026#39;s still not quite as convenient because that additional controller takes up a lot more space if you want to travel with it, whereas the controller on the Switch 2 is just part of the console until you remove it.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThis flexibility has always made the Switch stand out from other handhelds, and that still holds true.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n
