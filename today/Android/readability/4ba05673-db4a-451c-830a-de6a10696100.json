For a limited time, the full DELTA2 bundle with a 220W solar panel is back down to $699, which matches its Black Friday low. That‚Äôs a 46% discount off the usual $1,299 price‚Äîno code, no coupon, just a straight-up steal for one of the best portable power stations in this range. The EF ECOFLOW solar generator isn‚Äôt just for emergencies. With its 1024Wh capacity and LFP (LiFePO4) battery tech, it‚Äôs perfect for off-grid weekends, backyard movie nights, or even keeping your fridge running during a blackout. It supports fast charging, has multiple ports including USB-A and USB-C, and comes with a foldable 220W solar panel that‚Äôs compact enough for RVs but powerful enough for real use. One reviewer even said it fully recharged the unit with just 5 hours of sunlight in Arizona. Need a power station that can keep up with your summer plans? ‚ö†Ô∏è Get in while it‚Äôs still $699‚Äî this deal saves you $600 and won‚Äôt stick around once stock runs low or summer demand kicks in.

It‚Äôs also way lighter than you‚Äôd expect at 58 lbs, and built tough enough for outdoor use. Whether you‚Äôre heading out to the woods or prepping for power outages, this combo has you covered. Seriously, this is one of those products that pays for itself the moment your power goes out. üõí Don‚Äôt wait‚Äî$600 off is the kind of deal that only comes around a few times a year.
