Samsung Galaxy Z Flip5That is in Europe at least, since these specs are for the SM-F761B model. Other markets might get another chipset, Samsung loves to do that sometimes. The Flip FE will have 8GB of RAM, and the same camera system seen in the Flip5 from 2023 - a 12 MP main camera, a 12 MP ultrawide, and a 10 MP selfie snapper. The source of these specs further claims that we should expect the Flip FE to basically be a Flip5 with an updated SoC. It remains to be seen whether the battery capacity will remain the same at 3,700 mAh as well. The main point of the Flip FE is that it will be cheaper than the Flip7, and with these specs it should be significantly more affordable if it's going to be successful. That will bring more people into the foldable realm for sure. Source (in Dutch)",
