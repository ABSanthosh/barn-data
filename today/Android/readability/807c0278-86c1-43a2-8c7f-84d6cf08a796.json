  "description": "Insta360 has launched the Ace Pro 2 action camera today, its entrant in the space dominated by GoPro and where DJI is also a contender. The camera costs $399.99, which actually makes it $50 less than its predecessor. In the EU, it's €449.99. The GoPro inspiration for the design is clear, and yet the Insta360's front display only displays information, not a live feed of what the camera sees. For that you get the hinged main screen, now 2.5\" in size, with improved brightness and pixel density. The Ace Pro 2 is rugged and water resistant up to 12m (with precise underwater controls).

For that you get the hinged main screen, now 2.5\" in size, with improved brightness and pixel density. The Ace Pro 2 is rugged and water resistant up to 12m (with precise underwater controls). It can record 8K video at 30fps and 4K120fps slow-mo using a 1/1.3\" type sensor. This is paired with a 157-degree wide-angle Leica Summarit lens. Speaking of Leica, you get Leica color profiles. The hardware paired with the AI-enhanced software is promised to deliver \"stunning low light clarity\". And with PureVideo, noise is reduced while brightness and details are enhanced (this is only available up to 4K60fps). Photos are captured in 50 MP resolution. Zooming in to 2x is promised not to lose any image quality, and the new integrated wind guard keeps noise at a minimum. Battery life is quoted at 180 minutes, and a charge up to 80% takes just 18 minutes with a 30W PD adapter. A full charge takes 47 minutes.",
