Back in September last year, Google retired its legendary Chromecast streaming device and replaced it with the more modern Google TV Streamer. While the name has less allure, it is arguably a lot more straightforward as to the purpose of its existence. The device also brought several very much needed upgrades to Google's streaming devices. The Google TV Streamer launched at $100, which is a lot more expensive than the top model Chromecast was, but admittedly, it brings a lot more to the table as well. If the price has been holding you back from copping one, you're going to like this deal. The only thing is that it is here for a limited time, so you'll want to strike fast. The Google TV Streamer Is Currently on Sale at a 21% Discount Image: Amazon There are a lot of reasons why you might want a Google TV Streamer. If you're a big Android guy, it's a great way to bring the Google ecosystem to your television, whether it is a dumb TV or a smart TV that runs on an OS that you're not particularly a fan of. At the same time, you might simply prefer the performance that the Google TV Streamer brings or one of its other features. Either way, back in September 2024, when the device was launched, it came with a $100 price tag. For full context, when the Google Chromecast with Google TV (4K) launched back in September 2020, it came with a launch price of $50. The fact that the newer model is twice the price makes it a hard buy for some folks, and that's perfectly reasonable. Image: Google For those who have been on the fence about getting it, especially because of its price, the time is now. Amazon is running a limited-time deal on the Google TV Streamer, slapping a 21% discount on it and knocking its pricing down to $79.00. While that still costs quite a bit, it is certainly a lot more affordable than before. There's no word on when this offer will expire, so you'll want to hop on it as soon as you can. What Does the Google TV Streamer Even Bring to the Table? Image: Google If you're still sticking with your Chromecast, you might feel no need to upgrade to Google's new device, and for many people, that's valid. However, anyone will enjoy the perks that the TV Streamer brings over the Chromecast, so let's talk about them: The Google TV Streamer comes with 32GB of storage, which is 4x what you got with the last generation of Chromecast devices. The processor in the Google TV Streamer is 22% faster than the Chromecast 4K, and even has double the RAM as well, so operation is smoother than ever. The Google TV Streamer comes with an Ethernet port, so you can entertain yourself with a more reliable internet connection. The Google TV Streamer has Matter and Thread support, which instantly enables it to be a smart home hub. The newer device has direct Dolby Atmos audio processing and AV1 codec support for better quality. The remote control for the Google TV Streamer is redesigned, with a “find my remote” feature, and a customizable button that you can map as you prefer. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
