We recently got our hands on the Oppo Reno13 Pro, and here are our first impressions of the smartphone. The Oppo Reno13 Pro has a 6.83\" quad-curved display of 2,800x1,272-pixel resolution on the front. It's an AMOLED panel with a refresh rate of 120Hz, HDR10+ support, and 1,200 nits peak brightness. The display is protected by Gorilla Glass 7i, and there's a punch-hole up top at the center for the 50MP selfie camera (with auto-focus). The Reno13 Pro's display also has an optical fingerprint scanner embedded, which is fast and accurate. However, it's positioned close to the bottom bezel, which isn't ideal. We'd have liked it to be placed higher for a more convenient phone-unlocking experience. Turn the phone around, and you see a camera island housing three cameras - 50MP primary (with OIS), 50MP telephoto (3.5x optical, OIS), and 8MP ultrawide (116˚ FOV). These cameras are joined by an oval-shaped flash surrounding a mirror of the same shape. The Oppo Reno13 Pro comes in Pink, Graphite Grey, and Plum Purple, which is called Mist Lavender in India and is also the subject of this article. As evident from its name, the Plum Purple model features swirling plumes on its back cover, and it actually looks nice when light hits the panel at different angles. The rear panel of the Plum Purple model also has a glittery pattern and matte finish, which makes it fingerprint and smudge-resistant. We like the overall build of the Reno13 Pro; however, its flat back panel and quad-curved display made it a bit uncomfortable to hold for the author of this article. A much better approach would've been to add some curvature to the back cover for a more comfortable in-hand experience - something like the vivo X200 and vivo X200 Pro. Under the hood, the Oppo Reno13 Pro has the Dimensity 8350 SoC with up to 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB of UFS 3.1 storage. The smartphone runs Android 15-based ColorOS 15 out of the box. Our Indian unit came pre-loaded with about 20 third-party apps and games - excluding App Market, Hot Apps, and Hot Games - and that's not ideal for a phone with a base price of INR49,999 ($575/€550) right now. On the upside, users have the option to uninstall all of these third-party apps/games if they wish to. Other highlights of the Oppo Reno13 Pro include a 5,800 mAh battery with 80W wired and 50W wireless charging, IP68 and IP69 rating, NFC, and IR blaster.
