Not only can you use the Echo Show 8 to control your smart home products, but you can also enjoy movies and take video calls right from the device. Get it now for just $40 while you can. While tablets, smartphones, and laptops get most of our attention, smart displays can come in handy as well, offering a convenient way to stay connected when you're going about your day. Not only does a smart display offer a great way to control all your smart home devices, but it can also work as an entertainment and communication hub as well. Related Amazon Echo Show 8 review: A happy medium Better than the Show 5 and cheaper than the Show 10, this smart display is just right While they can be expensive, we've seen some impressive deals on some excellent models that make them worth picking up. For a limited time, the Amazon Echo Show 8 is down to its best price yet, coming in with a steep 65% discount that drops it down to just $40. You can grab this promotion from Woot for a limited time if you're quick. What's great about the Echo Show 8? When we originally reviewed this device, we loved that it had a large display, making it easy to read, and powerful speakers that delivered great sound. Furthermore, it also runs much smoother than the base model Echo Show 5, which can really enhance the experience if you use it day to day. You get a fairly sleek design that can look good in any room, with the large screen getting most of the attention. The front also houses a 13MP camera that can be used for video calls. Just in case you don't like the idea of a camera being pointed at you all the time, there's a manual shutter that can cover it when not in use. At the rear, there's a nice mesh fabric that covers the two neodymium speakers, and minimal ports at the rear with just power and a micro-USB port. The software is what makes this device, providing access to a wealth of apps and important streaming services. You can also use Alexa to get things done using simple commands, or control other connected smart home products. Overall, not a bad product at all, especially at its current price, which brings it down to just $40, which is an absolute steal. Just be sure to put it in your cart to see the full discount from Woot.",

The front also houses a 13MP camera that can be used for video calls. Just in case you don\u0026#39;t like the idea of a camera being pointed at you all the time, there\u0026#39;s a manual shutter that can cover it when not in use.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eAt the rear, there\u0026#39;s a nice mesh fabric that covers the two neodymium speakers, and minimal ports at the rear with just power and a micro-USB port. The software is what makes this device, providing access to a wealth of apps and important streaming services. You can also use Alexa to get things done using simple commands, or control other connected smart home products. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eOverall, not a bad product at all, especially at its current price, which brings it down to just $40, which is an absolute steal.
