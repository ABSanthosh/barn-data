  "text": "Rita El Khoury / Android AuthorityTL;DR Google has sent an email to some users saying that it accidentally deleted Google Maps Timeline data. The email was only sent out to affected users, but urges them to restore their data from a backup. Unfortunately, you’re out of luck if you didn’t have Timeline backups enabled. Update: March 22, 2025 (11:30 AM ET): Google has issued a statement to Android Authority, confirming that a technical issue resulted in Timeline data being deleted for some users. The statement indeed notes that people with Timeline backups enabled should be able to restore their data, but there’s bad news if you didn’t have backups enabled to begin with.Check out the full statement from Google below: We briefly experienced a technical issue that caused the deletion of Timeline data for some people. Nearly everyone with encrypted Timeline backups will be able to restore their data; unfortunately those who did not have backups enabled will not be able to recover lost data. That’s a disappointing turn of events if you value this feature. It also comes in the wake of Timeline data disappearing for some users when Google moved from cloud-based storage of this data to on-device storage.Original article: March 22, 2025 (12:52 AM ET): Google recently changed the way the Timeline feature works in Google Maps, transitioning to on-device storage of your previous movements. Unfortunately, some users reported earlier this month that their Timeline data vanished altogether. Now, Google has apparently issued an email to affected people.Redditor sweepernosweeping reported that Google sent them an email confirming that it accidentally deleted Timeline data for some people: Hi \u003creal name\u003e, We briefly experienced a technical issue that caused the deletion of Timeline data for some people. We’re reaching out as your account may have been impacted. If you have encrypted backups enabled, you may be able to restore your data. Make sure that you have the latest version of Google Maps, then go to your Timeline. Tap the cloud icon ( ) near the top of your screen, and choose a backup to import your data. If you did not have backups turned on, unfortunately you will not be able to recover lost data. We understand that this can be frustrating if you use Timeline to remember places that you’ve visited, and we are taking steps to improve our systems for the future. The Timeline Team The user noted that they checked their Timeline data and discovered that they only had the last two weeks of data. Unfortunately, it sounds like they weren’t able to restore a backup.Several other users also chimed in to confirm receipt of the email, with some reporting that they could restore their data from a cloud backup. However, others reported that the backup only restored the last few weeks of data, or that they didn’t have a backup at all.Is your Google Maps Timeline data missing?344 votesNeedless to say, you might want to enable Timeline data backups on your phone right now if you’re concerned about this issue, as it isn’t enabled by default. I also noticed that my Pixel 7 Pro only had a few weeks of data, but my vivo X200 Pro had my entire Timeline history, ostensibly because I chose the latter as my main Timeline device. So keep that in mind if you’ve got two or more phones and want to enable backups.We’ve asked Google about this email and the enclosed steps and will update our article as soon as the company responds to us. Nevertheless, this is another disappointing turn of events regarding Google’s Timeline migration process.Got a tip? Talk to us! Email our staff at news@androidauthority.com.
