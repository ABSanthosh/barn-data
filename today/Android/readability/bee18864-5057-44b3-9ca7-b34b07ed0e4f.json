Designed for developers, designers, gamers, and remote workers, it reimagines what an ergonomic computer chair can do, turning sitting into something it’s never been before: good for you. The Way We Work Has Changed. Our Chairs Haven’t.  According to the American Posture Institute, the average American sits for 9.5 hours a day — over a third of their life — and they’re paying for it: chronic pain, fatigue, poor posture, and trouble focusing. Remote calls, long edits, deep research — modern work is dynamic. But most ergonomic office chairs are stuck in the past: rigid frames, limited adjustments, and one-size-fits-all support that doesn’t deliver. Your body was designed to move, your chair should be too. Omni is built on a simple truth: when your body moves, your support should move with it. Its OmniDyna Support system adjusts as you shift, stretch, or lean. Powered by the ErgoPulse Motor System, Omni adapts as you move — delivering smooth, responsive support that keeps you aligned and comfortable. Connecting it all is the Bionic FlexFit Backrest — your second spine. Inspired by the natural S-curve of the human body, it features 16 precision joints and 8 adaptive panels that work in harmony to deliver real-time, responsive support. You’re Not Going to Sit the Same All Day. No two moments of your day are the same, and Omni understands that. You might be editing for hours, presenting on camera, or catching your breath after an intense game. Omni adapts — shifting easily from upright to fully reclined — keeping you supported no matter what you’re doing. 105° — Deep Focus Mode For upright, composed posture during calls and presentations. Meeting Mode supports a confident, camera-ready presence. 120° — Solo-work Mode Ideal for long, focused tasks with balanced support and flexibility. 135° — Soft Recline Mode A relaxed, fully reclined position perfect for gaming, watching videos, or simply unwinding. 160° — Spine Flow Mode Deep recline designed for spinal decompression and full-body reset. Solving the Problem We All Sit With. “We didn’t set out to build a chair. We set out to fix sitting.” — LeYan, Founder \u0026 CEO of LiberNovo Years of back pain and frustration with overpriced, underperforming chairs led Alex to rethink what an ergonomic design should really mean. The result is Omni — a dynamic ergonomic chair and StaySync footrest, fully customizable support that’s designed to move as naturally as we do.
