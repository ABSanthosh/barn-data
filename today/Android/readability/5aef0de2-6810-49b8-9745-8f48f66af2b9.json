With how advanced smartphone cameras have gotten, most people don’t need to spend thousands of dollars on a professional camera when their thousand-dollar phone can produce photos and videos that are good enough for their needs. There are some aspects where smartphone cameras can improve, like lighting and stabilization, but there are fixes for that. Speaking of stabilization, smartphone gimbals can help bridge that gap, especially when you frequently record videos, whether for content, work, or personal memories. Insta360 has just unveiled its Flow 2, and if the company has its way, its brand-new gimbal will be your choice. The Insta360 Flow 2 Smartphone Gimbal Wants to Do It All for You Image: Insta360 It’s not like there’s a reason to need more than one gimbal for your smartphone, but Insta360 wants to remove even the slightest temptation by delivering this value-focused gimbal that somehow manages to cover all the major bases. Let’s dive into the Flow 2 and what makes it special. Built Compact and Sturdy The first thing that you need to know is that the Insta360 Flow 2 is built to handle wherever you might need to take it. It is compact and weighs only 348 grams. Additionally, it features a metal tripod that folds into the gimbal itself, and that tripod also allows it to double as a selfie stick. Everything you need is in the well-built little package that is the Flow 2. The Flow 2 Is Programmed to Make Shooting a Breeze Image: Insta360 The Flow 2 could get away with simply stabilizing your phone, but the needs of content creators in 2025 extend far beyond that. The Flow 2 brings a lot more: 3-Axis Stabilization: Keeps your video steady, regardless of which direction the shake is towards. Deep Track 4.0: Insta360’s smartest tracking technology identifies subjects much better, including groups. Pro Framing Grid: A single tap uses the golden ratio and gives you multiple options for framing. AI Tracker: Allows for tracking in third-party apps without the tracking support of Insta360’s camera app. Requires the AI Tracking bundle, which costs $20 more. Several More Features for Convenience Image: Insta360 That’s not all that the Insta360 Flow 2 has, as there are a bunch of features that might not inherently be focused on video recording, but will still make your life easier when using this gimbal. NFC One-Tap Shooting: With some phones that have NFC, all you have to do is tap your device, and you’re instantly connected. No need to worry about Bluetooth pairing. Control Via Smartwatch or Second Smartphone: With an Apple Watch or another smartwatch, you’ll be able to control the Flow 2, which is great for those shots where you don’t want to put someone on photographer duty. Teleprompter: You can load your script on the phone and have it autoscroll while the video records at the same time. Pricing and Availability Image: Insta360 The Insta360 Flow 2 can be purchased on the company’s official website or on Amazon. However, there are two models: one with AI tracking and one without. The Standard Bundle will set you back by $109.99, while the AI Tracker Bundle is a little more expensive at $129.99.
