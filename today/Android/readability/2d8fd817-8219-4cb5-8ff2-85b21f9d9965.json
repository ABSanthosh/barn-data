While there is hyperbole there, it is not far-fetched to say that Stardew Valley is one of the best cozy games ever created and shares that title alongside other greats such as Disney Dreamlight Valley, Animal Crossing, and Harvest Moon. With that being said, we have come up with several reasons as to why Stardew Valley deserves to be crowned the best cozy game. 4 Tons of relatable characters Everyone needs somebody they can relate to Stardew Valley has, by far, the most characters of any cozy game that I have played. With over 30 NPCs, most of them being giftable or romanceable, there is bound to be somebody that everyone can relate to. In total, you can give gifts to 34 different characters. Even more, you can learn who they are, what they like, their schedule, and so much more. It is obvious that the Stardew Valley devs put a lot of time into the relationship side of the game. Let's break down one character: Robin. She is one of the many shop owners found in Stardew Valley who resides at 24 Mountain Road with Demetrius, Maru, and Sebastian. Her shop is closed on Tuesdays because she has a weekly exercise class. She loves goat cheese, peaches, and spaghetti and hates Holly. There is a large list of movies she enjoys, along with snacks, and she will talk to you about her family. Yes, other cozy games have relationship systems like this, but none are as in-depth as the one found in Stardew Valley. The developers really took it to the next level with this game. It goes far deeper than I even described, with characters having mental issues and even addictions. 3 Constant love from the developers It's almost like watching a sitcom Source: ConcernedApe Something as big as Stardew Valley didn't get that way overnight. The developers worked tirelessly to make the game everything they wanted it to be. In fact, they are still working on it. Over the years, Stardew Valley has received consistent updates from the developers that have added additional content and fixed major bugs and issues players have had. Pets, festivals, events, additional dialogue, farm layouts, and more have been added over the years, and it has kept players interested in returning to the game to find out what is new. I compare the game to a sitcom because it might not appear as much at first. Imagine the show Gilmore Girls. At first, you see a surface layer and are a little impressed, but the more characters that appear and the more you learn, the better the show becomes. Stardew Valley is similar. At first, you had access to so little. Over the years, more characters have appeared, additions have been made, you've learned about the characters, and now the game is an icon. Related 9 cozy games to help battle burnout Because sometimes you need a brain break 2 No Microtransactions Source: ConcernedApe One of the biggest annoyances nowadays is the number of microtransactions found in any type of video game. If you are playing a shooter game, you can pay for skins. Those playing MMOs can pay for mounts, skins, and more. Those playing cozy games are often asked to purchase an in-game currency that is then used to unlock more items. Dreamlight Valley offers this a lot. Thankfully, Stardew Valley is above all of that. When you purchase the game, you get what you paid for, and that is hours upon hours of relaxing fun that you can curl up with on the couch. You don't need to worry about paying an extra fee to add another romanceable character to the game. Instead, it is all presented to you and ready to be obtained with a bit of work. 1 One word: freedom Pick and choose what you want to do Most cozy games offer a degree of freedom that allows you to do whatever you want in the space you reside in. In the case of Animal Crossing, you can typically choose where villager houses go, and you have the option to perform various tasks to collect Bells. Stardew Valley has always had greater freedom than most other cozy games. You have the options to fish, farm, mine, interact with NPCs, and design your farm. With a massive world to explore, there is also plenty to see and return to, making Stardew Valley one of the biggest cozy games on the market. Sure, games such as Disney Dreamlight Valley have areas to explore but rules very much bind them, while Stardew Valley brings in the mystical as well to deepen the amazement of the world as you explore and doesn't seek to restrain your options in any way. Related 5 people who made their own handheld gaming device If you can't build your own, storebought is fine. Stardew Valley wears the crown Stardew Valley has been around for almost 10 years. After its release in 2016, it was quickly crowned one of the best cozy games ever made. Players immediately fell in love with the cute pixelated art style, many related characters, and large world. Thanks to consistent updates, additional features, and more, Stardew Valley stands at the top when it comes to cozy games, and it doesn't look like it will be dethroned any time soon.",

When you purchase the game, you get what you paid for, and that is hours upon hours of relaxing fun that you can curl up with on the couch. You don\u0026#39;t need to worry about paying an extra fee to add another romanceable character to the game.
