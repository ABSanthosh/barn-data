  "description": "Motorola Edge 50 reached our office and we are about to run it through our review course. Our unit has a Vegan Suede back named \"Koala Grey,\" although it also comes in the Pantone 2024 Color of the Year Peach Fuzz version. The Edge 50 is rather impressive with its lightweight feel. The back panel has nothing to do with the fuzzy touch of natural suede; it is closer to the thick, buttery feel of synthetic microfiber material.

Our unit has a Vegan Suede back named \"Koala Grey,\" although it also comes in the Pantone 2024 Color of the Year Peach Fuzz version. The Edge 50 is rather impressive with its lightweight feel. The back panel has nothing to do with the fuzzy touch of natural suede; it is closer to the thick, buttery feel of synthetic microfiber material. Motorola also provides a protective case in the retail box, which hides the color and offers a more familiar in-hand sensation. It is also snapping only on top and bottom, allowing you to constantly feel how thin and elegant the device is. The retail box is recyclable and extremely Eco-friendly. Sadly that also means Motorola did not provide an adapter - there is just a USB-C to USB-C cable. The Edge 50 supports 68W charging, and while some markets might get a charger, most are getting the thin box. The package also carries stickers highlighting its IP68 rating, Grade B repairability and Grade A durability, courtesy of Corning Gorilla Glass 5. The Edge 50 has the same cameras as the Edge 50 Neo. However, we expect images to turn out slightly differently due to the Qualcomm chipset, which should provide faster processing speeds. The battery is also a lot bigger, and the 5,000 mAh capacity should result in longer endurance in our Battery Life Test 2.0. The full review is already underway. Once we are ready with all the tests, it will hit our homepage. Stay tuned!",
