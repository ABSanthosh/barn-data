This time around we have a couple of shots showing the Galaxy S25 or the S25+ (they look exactly the same, the only difference is the size) on one hand, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra on the other. There's an interesting detail in this first image, namely that the outer part of the camera 'rings' matches the color of the phone's back, at least in this rather dark blue hue. As you can see, the frame is flat, the screen is flat, and the bezels are insanely thin (and thinner than last year). Moving on to the Ultra, the color matching of the camera...",

Moving on to the Ultra, the color matching of the camera rings seems to be to the frame color this time around, not the rear color, but that could obviously vary depending on which colorway you choose. The Ultra is confirmed for the umpteenth time to have rounded corners, although they are way less rounded than those of the other two models in the family. The screen is flat, the frame is flat, the bezels are tiny, and we get a glimpse of the Now Bar in One UI 7 advertising its Now Brief - \"today's highlight\" which should be \"highlights\" we'd wager. AI is everywhere, and other than that there will probably be a price hike too. But at least we're getting the Snapdragon 8 Elite on all of these phones everywhere. They are going to become official on January 22, and ahead of that Samsung has already officially teased Bixby and improvements to Sketch to Image. Source",
