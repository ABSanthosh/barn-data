Anker is one of the best brands in the mobile space when it comes to buying smartphone accessories and other electronics. If you're looking for charging accessories like power banks or charging bricks, I can recommend Anker on any day of the week. It's easy to take that same trust into the other things that the company makes. Anker makes a whole lot more than just phone accessories, though, especially through its smart home-focused sub-brand Eufy. You should know that Anker is offering sweet deals on products across its portfolio. The only caveat is that a lot of these deals are exclusive to users with Amazon Prime, but considering the savings, it is worth hopping on. Eufy Omni S1 Pro $999.99 Normally selling for $1,499.99, a huge 33.3% discount brings this high-end premium vacuum into a more accessible price range. For full context, this robot can vacuum and mop your floors, but it can also find its way back to its charging station to empty, refill, and even self-clean. Plus, with all its smarts, it can map out your home and find its way around without an issue. Anker Soundcore Boom 2 Plus $179.99 Soundcore, an Anker sub-brand, offers the Boom 2 Plus, which normally costs $249.99. This 140W Bluetooth speaker provides plenty of volume and plenty of bass, while bringing a lot more to the table. For instance, it can serve as a power bank, it has IPX7 certification, and you can expect it to go as long as 20 hours on a full charge. The RGB lights don't hurt either. Anker Soundcore P30i $29.99 If you want a pair of inexpensive earbuds to enjoy your music through, the Soundcore P30i is a fantastic choice. They usually cost $49.99, but with a 20% price slash and a further $10 off coupon, you can get them for just $29.99. You get 45 hours of playtime with the case, IP54 certification, and the case can even double as a stand for your phone if you need it to. Eufy X10 Pro Omni $549.99 If you are fine with a mid-range robot vacuum, then Eufy's X10 Pro Omni should be a better fit for your wallet. Normally priced at $899.99, a heavy price cut brings it a lot closer to the ground. This robot vacuum can also handle mopping and vacuuming functions and is capable of dodging obstacles in your house with the power of AI, including lifting over carpets. Anker Offers Some Big Discounts Through Its Soundcore and Eufy Sub-Brands While Anker is best known for its phone accessories, today's deals aren't about those ones. Instead, they focus on the company's sub-brands. With Soundcore, you can be assured of affordable and yet high-quality audio devices, including the Boom 2 Plus Bluetooth speaker or the Soundcore P30i, which appear on this list. Or perhaps you're building a smart home. If that's the case, Eufy is the brand for you. Normally rather expensive, Anker is giving you major discounts on some of its Eufy robot vacuums, giving you a chance to enter the future and worry a lot less about cleaning. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
