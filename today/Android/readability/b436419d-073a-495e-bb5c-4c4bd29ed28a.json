The phone exudes “flagship” with a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, a 6.82” 1440p+ LTPO display, three 50MP Hasselblad cameras, an IP68/IP69 rating and a 6,000mAh battery with 100W wired and 50W wireless charging support. Check out our written review and our video review for a closer look. Note that we’ve only linked the 16/512GB variant as that currently has a £100 discount (dropping its price to match the 12/256GB variant). And to top it off, you get a free OnePlus Watch 2R. The OnePlus Watch 2R has an MSRP of £250, but you can get it on its own for £180. It’s a Wear OS watch based on the Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 chip. It has a 1.43” display (AMOLED, Panda Glass) and an aluminum frame that is rated IP68. The battery has 500mAh capacity. In our review, we found it to be an excellent upgrade to the Watch 2, though there were still a few rough corners left. The Redmi Note 14 series arrived in Europe last week, but these aren’t the same models as the phones called “Redmi Note 14” that are sold in India and China. The Redmi Note 14 Pro+ is the top dog with a Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 and 120W fast charging, plus a glass back option (some colors have vegan leather backs instead). And you can get it in a 12/512GB configuration. That said, the Redmi Note 14 Pro 5G is nearly the same phone, except it uses the Dimensity 7300 Ultra, its battery does 45W charging and the options for the back are plastic or vegan leather. However, you get the same curved 6.67” 1220p+ OLED display with 12-bit colors, the same 200MP main camera and 8MP ultra wide, same IP68 dust and water resistance and same 5,110mAh battery capacity. And this one is £90 cheaper than the Pro+ (looking at the 8/256GB models). The Redmi Note 14 4G slots in lower with only LTE connectivity (there is a 5G variant as well, but it isn’t available yet). It is powered by the Helio G99 Ultra and a larger 5,500mAh battery with slower 33W charging. The 6.67” OLED display is flat and has 1080p+ resolution. The camera setup boasts a 108MP main, but it is accompanied only by a 2MP macro and a 2MP depth sensor. The phone is rated IP54, giving it protection only against splashes of water. At least this model has a microSD slot and a 3.5mm headphone jack, unlike the two Pro variants. While we’re looking at Redmis, check out the Redmi Pad SE 8.7. This £100 tablet has an 8.7” IPS LCD, a 90Hz panel with 1,340 x 800px resolution. It is powered by the Helio G85, so it’s no powerhouse, but it is a good alternative to the Amazon tablets and others in this price range. We may get a commission from qualifying sales.",
