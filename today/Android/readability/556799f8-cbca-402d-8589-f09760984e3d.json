  "text": "A while back, AYANEO made the headlines with the launch of the “Flip” series, a pair of foldable gaming handhelds which came in dual-screen and keyboard variants. While the brand has continued to pump out more “standard” handhelds, it looks like it’s finally unveiled a follow-up to the original Flip DS. READ: AYANEO’s New Windows Handheld Comes with a Familiar Look Dubbed the “AYANEO Flip 1S DS,” the new model retains the hinged dual-screen design of the original, which itself is modelled after the Nintendo DS, albeit in a much larger frame. The upper half of the device houses a 7-inch 144Hz OLED main display with up to 800 nits of brightness, accompanied by a smaller 4.5-inch LCD screen with a 3:2 aspect ratio. Inside, the handheld is powered by the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Processor, which works alongside a built-in Vapor Chamber with an Air Cooling System. You also get dual USB-4 ports, in addition to a newly-designed hinge that works similarly to the one on the Nintendo 2DS XL. There’s also a full set of controls, and the device runs on AYASpace 3.0, the company’s self-developed software ecosystem. With all that being said though, AYANEO still hasn’t mentioned details regarding pricing and availability, so we’d recommend keeping your eyes peeled for more info in the coming weeks and months.",
