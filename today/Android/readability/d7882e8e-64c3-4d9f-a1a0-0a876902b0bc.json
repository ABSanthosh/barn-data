This model falls in the “flagship killer” category with its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset and 6.67” 1440p+ display (12-bit, Dolby Vision). It has a 6,000mAh battery with 90W fast charging and goodies like an ultrasonic fingerprint reader. The camera is fairly basic, though, with a 50MP main (1/1.55”, OIS) and an 8MP ultra-wide. The Poco F7 Ultra is a proper flagship and while its discount is smaller (€50), it’s one of the most affordable Snapdragon 8 Elite phones out there. This model adds a 50MP 2.5x (60mm) tele lens and upgrades the ultra-wide to a 32MP sensor. The battery is smaller at 5,300mAh, but supports super fast 120W wired and 50W wireless charging. Check out our Poco F7 Pro vs. F7 Ultra article for a detailed comparison. The CMF Phone 2 Pro was unveiled on Monday and is currently on pre-order with sales starting on May 12 (Monday two weeks from now). It comes with a free pair of CMF Buds 2, which were unveiled alongside the phone. And here are the buds on their own - they offer good noise cancellation, Dirac Opteo tuning, multi-point connectivity and more at a reasonable price. The CMF Phone 2 Pro starts at €250, which is pretty cheap already. But you can get the original CMF Phone 1 for €70 less. Is it worth it? You get a slightly smaller display (6.67” vs. 6.77”) and though it is a 1080p+ 120Hz OLED, it has a lower peak brightness (2,000 nits vs. 3,000 nits) and doesn’t have HDR10+ support like the Pro. It has basically the same Dimensity 7300 chipset, though, with expandable storage and the same 5,000mAh battery with 33W charging. The real reason to get the Pro is for the cameras – the Phone 1 has a 50MP main on the back and that’s it. The Pro has a 50MP main with a fairly large 1/1.57” sensor (but no OIS), a 50MP 50mm telephoto and an 8MP ultra-wide. A new attachable back adds MagSafe magnets (there’s no wireless charging, but it’s nice for a car dock and to attach accessories) and serves as a mounting point for two lenses, macro and fisheye. Oh, and the Pro has NFC! We’ve seen some commenters wish for features like OIS, for example. For that, you have to get the Nothing Phone (3a), but that costs €80. Compared to the CMF Phone 2 Pro, you get the same screen and cameras (now with OIS on the main) and a better Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset. Charging is boosted to 50W, but it’s still wired only. You do get the Glyph lights on the back, though. What about the previous generation – the Nothing Phone (2a) is still around and is actually cheaper than the CMF Phone 2 Pro. You get a comparable 6.7” OLED display, HDR and all, plus Glyph lights and 45W charging for the 5,000mAh battery. There’s no telephoto camera, but how useful is a 50mm lens anyway? Plus, the 50MP main on this one has OIS and there is a high-resolution 50MP ultra-wide. The Dimensity 7200 Pro is only a bit slower, but you do lose the microSD slot. The Poco X7 is powered by basically the same Dimensity 7300 chipset as the CMF Phone 2 Pro and you can get more RAM and a lot more storage (12/512GB) for just €20 more than the CMF. There’s no microSD slot, but with 512GB built-in that’s not as necessary. The Poco has proper water resistance (IP69 vs. IP54) and a better 6.67” 12-bit 1220p+ display with Dolby Vision. The 50MP main camera does have OIS, but it uses a smaller 1/1.95” sensor and is only joined by an 8MP ultra-wide – there’s no tele lens here. The battery is a bit larger and faster at 5,110mAh capacity and 45W charging. If you have more money to spend, the Poco X7 Pro upgrades to a Dimensity 8400 Ultra (with all big Cortex-A725 cores) and a 6,000mAh battery with 90W charging. The cameras are the same as on the X7, though, i.e. not as good as the CMF. Last year’s Motorola Edge 50 Fusion has a curved 6.7” 1080p+ OLED display (10-bit, 144Hz) and a proper IP68 rating. It’s powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2, which is comparable with the Dimensity 7300 but you don’t get expandable storage and there are only 2 OS updates left. The 50MP main camera (1/1.56” sensor) does have OIS and it is joined by a 13MP ultra-wide, but there is no telephoto lens. The phone has a 5,000mAh battery with faster 68W wired charging. Another similarly-priced alternative is the Redmi Note 14 5G – this one doesn’t have a telephoto lens, but it does have a 108MP main camera with OIS that has a 3x zoom mode (which isn’t great). The phone is powered by the Dimensity 7025 Ultra and does have a microSD slot. There’s even a 3.5mm headphone jack. On the downside, the phone has only one OS update left on the clock.
