  "text": "Anker Nano Charging Station $36 $50 Save $14 This charging station provides all the ports you need to charge up all your devices. Not only do you get USB, but this device also includes AC outlets as well. The best part is that it isn't that expensive, coming in at just $36 for a limited time. A quality charger becomes an essential tool if you're someone that relies on their phone, tablet, or computer on a daily basis — which most of us do. Of course, if you're looking to go a little beyond that to something more versatile, we think this Anker charging station is going to be a good option, offering USB ports, AC outlets, and a long extension cord which makes it easy to plug in no matter where you are. Related The best part is that the current price of this charging station makes it very affordable, coming in with a discount that drops it to just $36. This is the best price we've seen on this model, which makes it the perfect time to buy if you've been looking to upgrade your charging situation. Just be sure to act fast because a promotion like this won't be around for long. What's great about this Anker charging station? Source: Anker This device is sleek, compact, and powerful. It's pretty much everything you'd want in a charging station, and its price is also quite affordable for what you're getting. This model comes with two USB-A and two USB-C ports on the front, making it easy to charge phones, tablets, and even laptops as well. You can do all of this because the charging station can provide up to 100W of power, which means you can pretty much charge any USB device out there without any issues. If you want, you can also plug in up to four devices at once if you're in a rush to get multiple devices charged. Just be aware that the previous 100W limit will now be divided into the four ports being used. Of course, not all devices can charge via USB, which is why having AC outlets is also a must. This charging station has three AC outlets in the rear, which keeps cable clutter to a minimum. There's also a long extension cable on the rear as well, making this charging station easy to maneuver when needed. If this sounds like what you're looking for, we recommend picking up this charging station for $36 while you still can. Anker is a pretty good brand when it comes to accessories and has been offering charging devices for quite some time. It even offers an 18-month warranty on this product, along with an $25,000 connected equipment warranty.",

sleek, compact, and powerful. It\u0026#39;s pretty much everything you\u0026#39;d want in a charging station, and its price is also quite affordable for what you\u0026#39;re getting. This model comes with two USB-A and two USB-C ports on the front, making it easy to charge phones, tablets, and even laptops as well.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eYou can do all of this because the charging station can provide up to 100W of power, which means you can pretty much charge any USB device out there without any issues. If you want, you can also plug in up to four devices at once if you\u0026#39;re in a rush to get multiple devices charged. Just be aware that the previous 100W limit will now be divided into the four ports being used. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eOf course, not all devices can charge via USB, which is why having AC outlets is also a must. This charging station has three AC outlets in the rear, which keeps cable clutter to a minimum. There\u0026#39;s also a long extension cable on the rear as well, making this charging station easy to maneuver when needed. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eIf this sounds like what you\u0026#39;re looking for, we recommend picking up this charging station for $36 while you still can. Anker is a pretty good brand when it comes to accessories and has been offering charging devices for quite some time. It even offers an 18-month warranty on this product, along with an $25,000 connected equipment warranty. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
