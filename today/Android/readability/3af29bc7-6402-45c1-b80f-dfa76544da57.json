With that in mind, folks after a capable smartphone camera can check out the Pixel 8 right now, which is going for as low as $529 on Amazon. In terms of specs, the Pixel 8 comes with some much-welcome upgrades over its predecessor, such as a smoother and brighter display with a 120Hz refresh rate, the same great camera quality, a more capable Tensor G3 chipset, new generative AI features, and a larger battery with faster charging speeds. Google has also included up to seven years of software support, meaning that you can keep holding onto the Pixel 8 for a very long time. You can check it out using the link below.
