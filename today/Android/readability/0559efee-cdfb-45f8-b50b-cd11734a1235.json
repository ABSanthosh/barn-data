However, that feature only works with one chat at a time, so WhatsApp is developing another feature called \"Quick Recap\" that will allow users to summarize messages from multiple conversations simultaneously. According to the folks at WABetaInfo, the Quick Recap feature will allow users to summarize messages in up to five conversations. All they have to do is select the chats in the Chats tab, tap on the three-dot menu icon in the top-right corner, and click on \"Quick Recap.\" WABetaInfo reports that, like Message Summaries, Quick Recap also uses Meta's Private Processing technology to generate message summaries, ensuring the original messages and the message summaries cannot be read by third parties, not even Meta or WhatsApp. Moreover, like Message Summaries, Quick Recap is optional and turned off by default. Besides, chats protected by \"Advanced chat privacy\" cannot be summarized using Quick Recap. WABetaInfo spotted this feature in beta version 2.25.21.12 of WhatsApp for Android. However, even if you are using this version, you won't be able to use the Quick Recap feature, as it's still in development. It should be available for beta users in the upcoming updates, followed by a stable release for all users. Source",
