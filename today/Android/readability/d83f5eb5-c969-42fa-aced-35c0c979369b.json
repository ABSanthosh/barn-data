With that said however, you might have to wait a bit before being able to get your hands on Google’s newest phone. READ: Pixel 9a Crushes the iPhone 16e in Every Way That Matters As it turns out, Google is delaying pre-orders for the new handset due to a “component quality issue” that has supposedly affected a certain number of units. While this might not be the news that you wanted to hear, it’s a good move on Google’s part especially when you consider that previous Pixel models developed certain hardware issues after launch. However, Google didn’t specify which specific issue was present on the Pixel 9a. If you’re keen on getting one, you might have to wait until April to be able to order the 9a, unless you’re totally fine with getting last year’s Pixel 8a of course, which still comes with some worthwhile features.
