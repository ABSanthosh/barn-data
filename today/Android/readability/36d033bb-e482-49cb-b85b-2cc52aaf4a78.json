Grab the Anker 511 charger for its best price as it drops to just $9.49 for a limited time. We've seen plenty of great deals during Prime Day, with impressive discounts on phones, tablets, robot vacuums, and so much more. Of course, this year's event is four days long, which means we still have a couple more days to discover new deals and save. With that said, we're seeing one of the smallest Anker chargers you can buy, discounted to a fantastic price. For a limited time, the Anker 511 charger is just $9.49, which is the lowest it's ever been. And size isn't everything, because this charger also delivers up to 20W of power, which is enough to power smartphones, tablets, and most accessories. Grab this charger at this price while you still can. It's great for home and the office, and even better for travel. What's great about the Anker 511 charger? Source: Anker This is one of those chargers that delivers a lot of power in an ultra-compact size. Anker is known for making some excellent charging accessories and this one is its most compact. It fits into most pockets and pouches, and is perfect for travel. The best part is that it delivers up to 20W of power with its single USB-C port, which is more than enough to power most phones, tablets, and smaller accessories. Naturally, this charger features Anker's safety features to ensure your devices are protected, and even come with an 18-month warranty. You will need to supply your own USB-C cable, which should come with your devices, but if you don't have one, and are looking for something new, we have some excellent ones to recommend. Just be sure to grab this charger quickly because this Prime Day discount won't last long.",
