The MagicPad 3 will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, paired with up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and up to 1TB of storage. It will support 66W wired charging, and will be offered in Moon Shadow White, Floating Gold, and Starry Sky Gray. Compared to its predecessor, the display tech has switched from OLED to LCD for price reasons, and the MagicPad 3 has an ever so slightly larger screen, and a faster chipset. It will be interesting to see the pricing - whether it remains the same or not, in light of the display tech switch that some may not like. Source (in Chinese)",
