The OnePlus Watch 3 measures 47.6 x 46.6 x 11.75 mm, which means it's 0.35 mm thinner than its predecessor. That's impressive considering the increased battery capacity. The new watch unsurprisingly supports Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, and NFC. It may become official internationally next month alongside the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R, the launch of which has already been confirmed by the brand. Source | Via",
