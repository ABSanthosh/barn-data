  "text": "PlayStation users, rejoice—Sony recently announced that it was finally bringing back classic themes to the PS5 menu via a new software update, which also includes some additional tweaks to the console’s overall sound quality. READ: PS5 Pro vs Xbox Series X: Which Console Should You Get? According to Sony, the new PS5 system update will launch on April 24th, and will be a gradual roll-out for different regions in the coming days and weeks. As mentioned earlier, a key highlight of the update is the Audio Focus feature which Sony says is designed to enhance audio immersion and accessibility for players when using headphones or headsets. To enable Audio Focus, users can navigate to Settings \u003e Sound \u003e Volume \u003e Audio Focus. During gameplay, the feature will also be accessible via the Control Center. With that in mind, users will have access to four distinct preset focus types including Boost Low Pitch that amplifies low-frequency sounds like engines and rumbles, Boost Voices that enhances character and chat sounds, Boost High Pitch for high-frequency sounds and Boost Quiet Sounds for low-level sounds. Furthermore, each preset type will offer three levels of intensity and players will have the option to independently adjust the support level for the left and right audio channels as well. More interestingly, the PS5 update will also see the return of classic console designs for the PS5 UI, which were initially offered as a limited-time offering during Sony’s 30th-anniversary celebrations. Sony says that it’s decided to bring back the themes due to demand from players worldwide, and will allow users to change up their UI’s look with themes from the original PlayStation, PS2, PS3, and PS4. The theme feature will be accessible under a new Appearance section within the Settings menu.",
