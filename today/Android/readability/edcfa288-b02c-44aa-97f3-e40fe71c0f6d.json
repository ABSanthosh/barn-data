However, the phone won’t actually be available until April and we don’t even have an exact date. So, let’s browse and see what else is out there. First, the pricing of the 9a – we know that it starts at $500, which should be for the 8/128GB model. There’s also an 8/256GB version, but the pricing for that hasn’t been announced yet. The Pixel 8a was $500/$560 for the same memory configurations at launch – and it still is. The older model should have discounts right now, unless it’s getting discontinued. So, we move over to the Google Pixel 9 instead – the premium mid-ranger from the Pixel series. It’s quite a step up to $680 for the base 128GB model (and this is with a solid $120 discount). You get a slightly more compact device (slimmer bezels, same size 6.3” 1080p+ 120Hz OLED display) but also a smaller battery (4,700mAh vs. 5,100mAh). Both use the same Tensor G4 chip, but the Pixel 9 has more RAM than the 9a (12GB vs. 8GB). The biggest reason to pay extra for the Pixel 9 over the 9a is the camera. The 50MP main has a much larger sensor (1/1.31” vs. 48MP 1/2.0”) and you get a high resolution 48MP ultra-wide (vs. 13MP). Both phones have aluminum frames and are rated IP68, but the 9 uses GG Victus 2 instead of Gorilla Glass 3. Satellite SOS is also missing from the 9a. The Google Pixel 9 Pro starts at $750. That is $250 more than the 9a, so they are not direct competitors. But with only $70 between the 9 and 9 Pro, it’s still worth considering. It has more RAM (16GB), a higher resolution display (1280p+ vs. 1080p+) and, more importantly, better cameras – a 48MP 5x (113mm) periscope and a 42MP selfie camera. For completeness’ sake, here is the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL as well, which is currently down to $900 for the version with 128GB storage, but the 256GB one is only $50 more. The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is a mid-range interpretation of the flagship series. It uses the Exynos 2400e chipset, which shares DNA with the Tensor chip but offers higher performance. This is a larger device (6.7” display vs. 6.3”), but you can’t tell from the 4,700mAh battery. You do get an 8MP 3x (75mm) telephoto lens, so you don’t have to rely on digital zoom like with the Pixel 9a. Both the Pixels and the S24 FE will receive 7 OS updates. The OnePlus 12R is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 – it may be two generations old, but it is still faster than the Tensor G4. It loses to the Exynos 2400e, though. Anyway, the 6.78” 1264p+ OLED display is an LTPO panel, which is typically a premium feature. And the large 5,500mAh battery supports fast 100W wired charging but lacks wireless. Finally, the IP64 rating is low, but should be okay in practice. Keep in mind this is a 256GB phone that costs $50 less than the 128GB Pixel 9a. Finally, you can explore a new form factor with the Motorola razr 2024 for the same price as the Pixel – $500 (though, again with 256GB storage instead of 128GB). The Dimensity 7300X is much slower than the Tensor, especially in graphics tests. Despite being a foldable, the razr has IPX8 water resistance. We may get a commission from qualifying sales.",
