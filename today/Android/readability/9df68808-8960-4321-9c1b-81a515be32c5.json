  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Google I/O 2025 is underway, with the first day shedding light on some of the great things that are about to come. In addition to its future, the brand also released Android 16 QPR1, with the public release set to take place in June. Related While Material 3 Expressive is going to be a huge part of the latest update, we're also seeing small quality of life tweaks, like resizing Quick Toggles, and also fun features like Magic Portrait find their way into the beta. Added convenience is never a bad thing Of course, there are going to be more hidden gems as people get to spend more time with the beta, but for now, the folks at 9to5Google have highlighted a change that brings a new redesign to the Recents menu. While the Recents menu for Android 15 wasn't bad, it could have used some improvements, particularly for large-screen Android devices. The news outlet highlights new changes, which brings a new grid design, making it a lot easier to manage multiple apps at once. This is going to be a very welcome change, especially for those using foldables like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Although foldable phones haven't really taken off as expected, mainly due to their price and compromises, laying the groundwork for better software support is an absolute must if the product category is going to be successful in the long run. There's also another change in the Recents menu that will add a new drop-down menu for the preview, allowing easy access to some of the menu options that were present in Android 15. This isn't a huge change, but it does make it easier to access the options than ever before. In addition to the above, we're seeing a lot of AI-related projects during Google's I/O event — which is to be expected. The brand announced a new AI filmmaking tool, along with Gemini now being able to make a renter's life easier when trying to find a new home. Gemini's AI Mode also got a wide release in the US, which will provide easier access to Google's AI tools. If you're interested in what's to come from Google, you'll definitely want to tune into our coverage from the event.",

Recents menu for Android 15 wasn\u0026#39;t bad, it could have used some improvements, particularly for large-screen Android devices. The news outlet highlights new changes, which brings a new grid design, making it a lot easier to manage multiple apps at once. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThis is going to be a very welcome change, especially for those using foldables like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Although foldable phones haven\u0026#39;t really taken off as expected, mainly due to their price and compromises, laying the groundwork for better software support is an absolute must if the product category is going to be successful in the long run. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s also another change in the Recents menu that will add a new drop-down menu for the preview, allowing easy access to some of the menu options that were present in Android 15. This isn\u0026#39;t a huge change, but it does make it easier to access the options than ever before. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the above, we\u0026#39;re seeing a lot of AI-related projects during Google\u0026#39;s I/O event — which is to be expected.
