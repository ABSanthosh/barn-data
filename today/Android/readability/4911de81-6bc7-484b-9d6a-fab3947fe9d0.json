While I still enjoy building my own boards and diving into group buys, I respect what Keychron is doing for the community: offering accessible, ready-to-go mechanical keyboards without the usual hobbyist hassle. That said, let’s not forget where Keychron started—low-profile keyboards.The new Keychron K5 Max proudly continues that tradition. Quick note: Keychron sent me the K5 Max for review, but they did not pay for this post nor preview it before publication. All thoughts and opinions here are entirely my own. Light as a Feather (But Not for Travel) The first thing you’ll notice about the K5 Max is how light it feels. Despite being a full-sized keyboard, it’s surprisingly lightweight. However, its full-sized layout does make it a bit bulky for travel. If portability is your priority, I’d recommend looking at the Keychron K3 Max or K7 Max, which are more travel-friendly. That said, the K5 Max is perfect for home or office use if you want a low-profile mechanical experience. In simple terms, the K5 Max features shorter, flatter keycaps than traditional mechanical keyboards. It’s not quite the same as a laptop keyboard, but it gets close. If you enjoy the feel of laptop keyboards, this is an excellent alternative for your desk setup. Despite the slim design, the K5 Max is still a proper mechanical keyboard. It uses Gateron low-profile switches, with two options available: Brown (Tactile): Includes a slight bump for feedback. Red (Linear): Smooth and bump-free for a quieter, faster feel. My review unit came with the brown switches, and I found them to strike a nice balance between tactility and quiet operation. Of course, switch preference is highly personal, so choose according to your typing style. Surprisingly Good Sound Dampening Keychron has equipped the K5 Max with advanced IXPE acoustic foam, and it genuinely makes a difference. Older low-profile Keychron boards had a rattly, hollow sound, but the K5 Max feels and sounds much more refined. Foam is usually reserved for larger, custom mechanical keyboards, so it’s a pleasant surprise to see it included here. The result? A noticeably quieter and more solid typing experience. Hot-Swappable Convenience Another welcome feature is hot-swappability. You can easily pull out the switches and replace them without soldering, provided you stick with Gateron or Keychron’s low-profile switches. Even better, the switches use an MX-style stem, which opens up more possibilities for aftermarket keycaps. The selection isn’t as broad as standard MX switches, but it’s improving steadily. Wired, Wireless, and Fully Programmable The K5 Max supports both wired and wireless connectivity, giving you flexibility depending on your setup. It’s also programmable through the Keychron Launcher, which offers a user-friendly interface for remapping keys without complicated software or steep learning curves. Additionally, the keyboard includes adjustable legs to tweak the typing angle to your liking. However, thanks to its inherently low-profile design, even at its highest setting, it remains fairly flat. Final Thoughts: Affordable and Functional All things considered, the Keychron K5 Max is a fantastic choice if you’re looking for a low-profile mechanical keyboard that doesn’t break the bank. Prices start at $94.99, and even the fully decked-out version with hot-swappable switches and RGB lighting only goes up to $114.99. At that price, the K5 Max punches well above its weight class, offering an excellent typing experience with great build quality and thoughtful features.
