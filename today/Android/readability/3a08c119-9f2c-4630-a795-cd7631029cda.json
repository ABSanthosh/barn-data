In this mystery area, the K80 devices will be better than many devices from competing brands, which will be released first. He also hints at the K80 family's release date by saying that people who want to change their phones at the end of the year should wait for Redmi's new flagships. Redmi K70 ProAccording to prolific Chinese leakster Digital Chat Station, the Redmi K80 series will come with price hikes, and the Pro's price will rise the most. That's not great news, but on the other hand he also revealed that the K80 line's top model will use Qualcomm's next flagship chipset (which is looking more and more likely to be called Snapdragon 8 Elite), a 6,000 mAh battery, as well as 100W fast wired charging. So perhaps the price increases will be deemed worth it by a lot of people. If you've read this far wondering why you've never heard of the Redmi K series before, it's because it's only sold in China under this name. Internationally, devices in this line often get rebranded as part of the Poco F series, and the news regarding price hikes certainly doesn't bode well for the next Poco F models.
