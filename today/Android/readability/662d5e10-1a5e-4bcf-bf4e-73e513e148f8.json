But taking a closer look at the numbers though, it seems that this year might have been one of the best for Google’s device series so far. READ: The Pixel 9 might have stolen some of Apple’s iPhone market share It should be noted that Google’s transition to its Tensor chipsets back in 2021 was seen both as a stepping stone and drawback by some, and while the succeeding years weren’t the smoothest for Pixel users, we’ve seen some significant growth and progress with the Pixel brand. 2024 sure wasn’t perfect either, but here are some factors as to why we think that this year is a significant milestone of sorts for Google’s flagship smartphone range. First up we have the Pixel 9 series phones – Google’s latest flagship devices come with newer designs which feature an overall more refined look, and are powered by the Tensor G4 chipset. The Tensor G4 isn’t a powerful chip, but its key strength is providing the Pixel 9 with improvements in terms of overall efficiency, battery endurance and thermal management, especially compared to earlier Pixel models. Google also claims that its new phones have posted impressive sales numbers, which in the context of its Pixel hardware range is pretty commenadable. As far as sales are concerned, Pixels have never been dominant in the overall smartphone landscape, but it’s nice to see them make progress in terms of market share. Google’s Pixel Watch series has also seen a “glow-up” of sorts with the new Pixel Watch 3 models, addressing issues from the first generation such as the poor battery life and limited size selection. 2024 wasn’t only great for the Pixel 9 series – in case you missed it, Google announced that it was extending software support for several of its older Tensor-powered phones. This means that users who own any of the Pixel 6 series, Pixel 7 series, as well as the original Pixel Fold will receive two more years of Android upgrades, a great move on Google’s behalf, and frankly something that more brands should follow. READ: How Long will your Pixel Phone Keep Getting Updates? With that being said, not all has been smooth sailing to be honest. For instance, while Gemini and AI on Pixel devices in general have been impressive, it’s clear that there’s still a lot of room for improvement, especially when it comes to how Gemini works as an intended replacement for Google Assistant. Even built-in features like Pixel Studio and Magic Editor are pretty limited when it comes to actual usability. I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen the error message “Magic Editor can’t complete this edit” show up on my screen with even the simplest of edits. I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen the error message “Magic Editor can’t complete this edit” show up on my screen with even the simplest of edits. There’s also the case of Google’s ill-fated Pixel Tablet series. While the Pixel phones and watches got all the attention, the Pixel Tablet was just sort of there in the background, occasionally getting discounts and even a re-release which removes the dock from the retail bundle. News that Google has now cancelled a would-be tablet successor doesn’t bode too well for the company’s nth attempt at launching and committing to a tablet product line, which now has fans questioning if it will ever launch a new tablet again. Quirky AI and tablet woes aside, Google’s Pixel series has seen some significant improvements this year, and with news of upcoming hardware transitions (such as a much-anticipated switch to TSMC) on the horizon, a lot of Pixel fans – including yours truly – are looking forward to the next generation of Pixel devices. Many fingers are crossed, and they’re crossed real tightly. A writer and content creator with a love for tech and music, Mike is also an avid gamer as well.
