The brand listed the known issues with this update in its community post but didn't mention an interesting feature it brings to the OnePlus 13. OnePlus 13 Spotted by an unofficial OnePlus System Apps channel on Telegram, the Android 16 beta 2 for the OnePlus 13 brings a customizable battery charging limit to the smartphone, allowing users to set the battery charging limit between 80% and 100% instead of the fixed 80%. However, you can't just select any number between 80 and 100. You get five options - 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, and 100%. The 100% option makes little sense to us since those who want their phone's battery fully charged wouldn't put any charging limit on it in the first place, so we might see this option removed with a future update. If you are running the Android 16 beta 2 on OnePlus 13, you can navigate to its Settings \u003e Battery \u003e Battery health menu and turn on the \"Charging limit\" toggle to choose the preferred charging limit for your smartphone.
