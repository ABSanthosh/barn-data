Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra is set to launch in roughly a month and it is certain to be the most-drooled-over entry in the upcoming S25 family of smartphones. We've been hearing a lot about what the device is going to do differently compared to its predecessor, such as rounding its corners. However, another thing that we know that it will do is give its bezels a dose of Ozempic. Not only do we know that the S25 Ultra will have incredibly thin bezels, but according to a certain tipster on X, it is going to have bezels thinner than anything else in this generation. That's quite a claim. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Is Allegedly Going To Have The Slimmest Bezels Available I have always loved those blocky big smartphones from Samsung. When the Note series still existed, I got myself a Note 10+, and when that line died and it was time to upgrade, I got myself an S22 Ultra. It's three years later and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is upon us, so naturally, I'm excited, even if it'll be cutting down on the blockiness a little bit (and even if I'm not upgrading this year). Image: Samsung According to Ice Universe on X, one of the most reliable Samsung-related leakers in the game, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is surely going to turn some heads once it goes public. It is going to have very thin bezels, which we could have guessed, but perhaps the interesting thing is that the leaker claims that the thinness of the bezels will usurp all current devices in the market. That's bold. If true, that should make the Galaxy S25 Ultra one of the most gorgeous devices available in 2025, and that's from a series that has already nailed it in the design category (doesn't mean I don't want that facelift one of these days). We Know The Different S25 Ultra Colorways To Expect Image: Samsung Fortunately, we've also got another piece of useful information, thanks to another reliable tipster—Evan Blass. We know the colorways that you can expect from the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. Obviously, we can tell that the phone is going to retain the titanium frame due to “Titanium” prefixing each color. Let's drop the metal for a second though, to show you a list of the colors that will be available: Black Gray Jade Green Jet Black Pink Gold Silver Blue White Silver If you know Samsung, three of those colorways are likely to be online exclusives—I'm betting on the last three. Jet Black is an interesting option when there's already a regular Black. That could potentially mean that the frame stays black while the regular option goes for a silver frame. That's just my guess though. The Galaxy S25 Launch Is Expected For January 22nd, Leaked Image Teases Four Models? Image: Evan Blass And yet another leak from Evan Blass (via his private X account, once again) shows us a leaked promotional image, confirming the January 22nd, 2025 date for the S25 family launch. Taking the image at face value does reveal something interesting, as it seems that the image is teasing four phones, and not just three. That could be teasing the existence of the Galaxy S25 Slim that we've been hearing about. However, maybe Samsung was just doing it for the sake of symmetry and forming a Gemini-like symbol, since we know AI will be a big part of it. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post Next Post",
