  "text": "Sign in to your XDA account Summary Microsoft is gradually moving Control Panel features to Settings in Windows 11. Recent changes include language settings, which are hidden in Dev and Beta builds. The hidden feature suggests Microsoft is working out bugs before wider release. Over the past few months, we've seen Microsoft drag its heels over scrapping the Control Panel. I mean, we know it wants to make the swap over to Settings already, but it's just seemingly taking its sweet time about it. We've seen the company move a handful of tools, then seemingly go to sleep, then move a few more after a hiatus, and then go back into hibernation. However, that may have changed. We last saw Microsoft move something around two weeks ago, but the company is already planning to migrate more features over. As such, if you're a fan of the Control Panel, now may be a good time to say your goodbyes. Related Microsoft moves some language settings over to Settings The news comes to us via PhantomOfEarth, who scours Windows 11 test builds for any new changes. We actually spotted them yesterday when they reported that Windows is getting a data migration tool, and now they're back once more reporting on the Settings panel. This time, it seems some language options have made the move: As Phantom mentions at the end of their post, this feature hasn't rolled out to the release branch yet. You can only see if you're on the Dev or Beta build of Windows 11 and you manually enable it yourself. The fact that it's hidden likely means that Microsoft hasn't ironed out all the bugs with the Settings implementation just yet, so it's keeping the change away from testers' eyes while it works on the issues. However, it's likely only a matter of time until this feature gets rolled out properly on the beta and then the release branches. The Control Panel has been around for a long time, but some people won't miss it when it is finally gone. Our editor, João Carrasqueira, made a post about the five reasons the Windows 11 Settings app makes him forget about the Control Panel, and while the new Settings panel is definitely a big step up for modernising the older parts of Windows, a part of me is still going to miss it.",

However, it\u0026#39;s likely only a matter of time until this feature gets rolled out properly on the beta and then the release branches.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe Control Panel has been around for a long time, but some people won\u0026#39;t miss it when it is finally gone.
