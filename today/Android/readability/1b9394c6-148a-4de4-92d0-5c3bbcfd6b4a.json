Mint Mobile is an MVNO that's owned by T-Mobile. As an MVNO, Mint essentially piggybacks on T-Mobile's network, which provides the opportunity for better prices than what you can get if you're using any of the big networks. That alone is enough for a lot of people to switch over to Mint. However, things have gotten even more enticing for people who have never tried out Mint Mobile before. The company is offering a major deal to new subscribers, giving them an opportunity to hop on their network's Unlimited plan for a full year, for half the price. That's a sweet deal. Mint Mobile Is Offering Its 5G Unlimited Plan At A 50% Discount For A Limited Time Image: Mint Mobile If you've been looking for a new network to save you from the complaints and woes that your current network is making you experience, there's no better time to switch over than when a competing network has deals to save you money. That's the case with Mint Mobile right now. Mint is an MVNO that's owned by T-Mobile and operates on T-Mobile's infrastructure. However, the plans that Mint offers are generally cheaper than what you can get with any of the Big 3 carriers. For instance, Mint's Unlimited plan with 5G and 4G LTE data typically costs $30 a month for the 12-month plan. Except, right now, it's even cheaper than that. Mint Mobile is offering its 12-month 5G Unlimited plan for 50% off, which brings what would normally be a $360 bill down to $180. That's a lot of money saved, especially when you consider that for some bigger networks, $180 might only get you a little over three months of service. You're going to want to move quick though, as this is only available until January 2nd. What Are The Conditions To Take Advantage Of This Deal? Image: Mint Mobile If you're savvy, you'll know that there's nothing for free in the universe, especially when it comes to mobile carriers. When they drop a sweet deal into your lap, there's usually some kind of catch or some kind of condition you need to fulfill. That's true in this case too, but it honestly isn't that bad. For one, you have to be a new customer, so if you're already on Mint Mobile, you're going to have to find another deal with your name on it. The second condition is that you're going to have to pay the discounted price for the entire 12 months at the onset. That means dropping $180. If you find it hard to part with that much money at once, it's a dealbreaker, but if not, it is certainly worth the savings over the rest of the year. What Does Mint Mobile's Unlimited Plan Offer You? Image: Mint Mobile If the savings sound good to you, you probably want to know what you actually get with that plan. That's a good question. First off, you'll get unlimited talk, text, and data, all on T-Mobile's infrastructure. That means you get access to T-Mobile's 5G network across the country, and though it is unlimited, you're guaranteed access to about 40GB of high-speed data. After that, you still get internet access, but speeds might be slower. On top of that, there's free international calling to Canada and Mexico and you get access to your phone's mobile hotspot to use with other devices.
