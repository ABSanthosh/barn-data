HMD Key official images The phone has a single speaker, an 8 MP rear camera, a 5 MP front-facing camera, Bluetooth 4.2, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, a USB Type-C port, and it's IP52 rated for dust and splash resistance. It will be offered in Midnight Black and Icy Blue. It measures 166.4 x 76.9 x 8.95 mm and weighs 185.4 g. With these specs you'd expect it to be cheap, and it kind of is, launching at £59 in the UK. It should also spread to other markets very soon, with Australia and New Zealand in the first batch. Thanks for the tip! Source",
