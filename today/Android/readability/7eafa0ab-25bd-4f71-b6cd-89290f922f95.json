  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Samsung is deleting inactive accounts starting July 31, 2025. Data associated with deleted accounts will be removed from Samsung servers. Users should log in to save their accounts before the deletion process begins. It's easy to think of things as being permanent when they're online, but the truth is that even large companies have finite resources, which means that if you haven't been using its services, there's a pretty good chance that at some point, your account will be deleted. Related We've seen this happen with Google, and now it appears that Samsung is taking some steps in order to clean out old accounts from its system. The news comes from SamMobile, reporting that Samsung is going to be deleting accounts that have been inactive for 24 months. Take action because it's happening soon While you still have some time to log into your account to save it, there isn't much time to be honest, so you'll want to take care of this as soon as possible. SamMobile reports that Samsung will begin the process of deleting accounts starting on July 31, 2025. Those that are affected have been informed, and should know that this is going to take place. Of course, if you're not really monitoring the account or data associated with it, there's a pretty good chance that the warnings from Samsung might go unnoticed. As far as what happens when an account is deleted, well, it's fairly simple, with all data being removed from Samsung's servers. This also means that all associated information about the account will be removed as well. This includes but is not limited to Samsung Cloud data, Samsung Wallet, Galaxy Store apps, Find My Mobile information, and more. Of course, if you were thinking about deleting your Samsung account anyway, this might be a good time to log in, check what's there, and do it on your own. You can easily delete your account without using a Samsung device, since all it requires is navigating to a website using a browser. Again, this all happens starting on July 31, 2025, for those that haven't logged into their accounts. If you're someone that's popped into their account every once in a while, then your data and account will remain safe, and you can ignore this warning. For others, you might want to check, just in case you have some information there that you need to save.",

target=\"_blank\"\u003eWe\u0026#39;ve seen this happen with Google\u003c/a\u003e, and now it appears that Samsung is taking some steps in order to clean out old accounts from its system. The \u003ca href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/your-samsung-account-will-be-deleted-on-july-31-if-its-been-inactive-for-24-months/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enews comes from SamMobile\u003c/a\u003e, reporting that Samsung is going to be deleting accounts that have been inactive for 24 months.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"take-action-because-it-39-s-happening-soon\"\u003e\n                        Take action because it\u0026#39;s happening soon\n               \u003c/h2\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003e While you still have some time to log into your account to save it, there isn\u0026#39;t much time to be honest, so you\u0026#39;ll want to take care of this as soon as possible. SamMobile reports that Samsung will begin the process of deleting accounts starting on July 31, 2025. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThose that are affected have been informed, and should know that this is going to take place. Of course, if you\u0026#39;re not really monitoring the account or data associated with it, there\u0026#39;s a pretty good chance that the warnings from Samsung might go unnoticed.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eAs far as what happens when an account is deleted, well, it\u0026#39;s fairly simple, with all data being removed from Samsung\u0026#39;s servers. This also means that all associated information about the account will be removed as well. This includes but is not limited to Samsung Cloud data, Samsung Wallet, Galaxy Store apps, Find My Mobile information, and more. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eOf course, if you were thinking about \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/delete-samsung-account-tutorial/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edeleting your Samsung account\u003c/a\u003e anyway, this might be a good time to log in, check what\u0026#39;s there, and do it on your own. You can easily delete your account without using a Samsung device, since all it requires is navigating to a website using a browser. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eAgain, this all happens starting on July 31, 2025, for those that haven\u0026#39;t logged into their accounts. If you\u0026#39;re someone that\u0026#39;s popped into their account every once in a while, then your data and account will remain safe, and you can ignore this warning. For others, you might want to check, just in case you have some information there that you need to save.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
