If both you and the person you're chatting with in Messages have WhatsApp, you'll get a new option in the top right menu: a video icon, which, if you tap, says WhatsApp Video Call.

Tapping on that will directly initiate the video call in WhatsApp. This is currently only for one-on-one chats. For group chats (or if the contact you're talking to one-on-one doesn't have WhatsApp), the video call option in Messages will default to Google Meet. Of course, the exact behavior could change between now and the release of the WhatsApp video call integration. Hopefully, Messages will give you the option to either use WhatsApp or Meet for video calls - since some people might want to use Meet to video call people who have WhatsApp as well. It's unclear when this feature is launching, but it is in active development, so it will probably arrive within the next few weeks. Source",
