It’s got a nice balance of hardware and performance that outshines similarly-priced smartphones from competitors, and it’s also on sale right now, going for much less than its usual 600-dollar price point. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Review (SAVE $400!) In terms of features, the OnePlus 13R features a display that measures at 6.78 inches with a 1264×2780 pixel resolution and a sooth 120Hz refresh rate, and it’s powered by the still-capable Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip inside, which makes it ideal for gaming and intensive apps. There’s also a massive 6,000 mAh battery inside which should easily last for more than a day—you can check it out using the link below.
