  "text": "In the past, when you get Android updates, you might expect 2-3 years for most manufacturers. However, that has changed in the past few years. More manufacturers are starting to introduce longer software support. This includes Samsung and Google, who are offering up to 7 years of software support for eligible devices. Now it looks like we can add Honor to that list as the company has announced that they are offering 7 years of software support for its Magic series of phones. According to Honor, this extended support includes both major OS updates as well as security updates. So, if for whatever reason you decide to hold onto your Honor Magic phone for the next 7 years, you should be covered in terms of security and OS updates. However, we imagine that towards the end things might not be so ideal. Hardware degradation along with newer features requiring more powerful hardware means that in the future, there could be certain features that can’t work or won’t work because of your phone’s aging hardware. However, at least Honor is giving users the option of keeping their phones longer. Hopefully, we’ll see more Android handset makers hop on board this bandwagon in the future.",
