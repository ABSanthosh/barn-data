That being said, Nissan recently showed off some videos highlighting its new LEAF model. READ: Pairr Mini adapter adds wireless CarPlay and Android Auto to almost any car According to Nissan, it’s sold 700,000 units of its LEAF model since its debut back in 2010, and it’s used this time to refine its approach to planning and engineering the upcoming model, especially since the company views the LEAF as one of its “heartbeat models” which sets apart from competing manufacturers. Richard Candler, Vice President for Global Product Strategy states: Beyond EV intenders and innovators we wanted the all-new Nissan LEAF to offer a truly credible alternative to combustion vehicles. We wanted it to balance emotional and rational appeal, ensuring it looks sleek and bold, whilst meeting the real-world needs of families with thoughtful design. Nissan says that the new LEAF’s design is developed to be aerodynamic while maintaining a “strong, bold presence” with a coefficient of drag measuring just 0.26 (Cd) for the U.S. and Japan. The vehicle’s European variants are fitted with a slightly-different wheel and door mirror design resulting in 0.25 Cd 1. Nissan has put a lot of thought into how the intricate details of the vehicle go hand-in-hand with its overall streamlined design—this includes the LEAF’s flush door handles, an active grille shutter, a new wheel design, a flat underfloor and fastback form factor, and even a liftback. Other details include a dimming panoramic roof with heat shielding for a bit of added privacy, which includes an infrared (IR) reflective coating that keeps things cool from the sun. Nissan has scheduled a global launch for the new LEAF later this month. A writer and content creator with a love for tech and music, Mike is also an avid gamer as well.
