  "text": "AMD Ryzen 5 9600X $222 $279 Save $57 The 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 9600X is a powerful processor with an efficient 65W TDP. This Zen 5 CPU has integrated graphics, DDR5 support, and a maximum boost of around 5.4GHz. It's ideal for systems where the most computing power isn't required, such as gaming rigs and general PC builds. There are a lot of great CPUs to choose from. But if you're looking for something that's going to work well in your setup without costing an arm and a leg, then AMD CPUs are going to be the way to go. You get a wide selection of options to choose from, making them great for budget PC builds or top-end gaming rigs. Related With that said, we've spotted this fantastic discount on one of our favorite AMD CPUs as it drops to its lowest price yet. The AMD Ryzen 5 9600X is extremely efficient, while at the same time offering impressive single and multicore performance. Best of all, during Amazon's Big Spring Sale, it can now be had for just $222, which is the best price we've seen to date. What's great about the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X? So, when it comes to hardware, the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X is an AM5 chip, which means it runs on the brand's latest platform, which will be supported for quite some time. You get six cores and 12 threads, along with a base clock speed of 3.9GHz, and a boost clock speed that tops out at 5.4GHz. You get full support for PCIe 5.0, DDR5-6000 RAM, and it has a TDP of 65W. What this all boils down to is that this processor is extremely efficient, powerful, and capable of handling pretty much anything you can throw at it. With all this said, you're going to need an AM5 motherboard to handle this chip. Of course, there are more powerful processors, but we think this one provides a solid foundation for anyone looking to build a new PC. Just be sure to grab it while you can, because this is a deal that won't be around for much longer. Shop other great deals during Amazon's Big Spring Sale event until the end of the week for awesome savings.",
