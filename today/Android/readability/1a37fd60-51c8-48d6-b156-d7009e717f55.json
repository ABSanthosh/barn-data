  "text": "case Sign in to your XDA account PC cases have come a long way since the late 90s, but one ATX case looks like any other ATX case. Take the Lian Li O11 Dynamic, first launched in 2018. This stunning piece of art was unlike anything else on the market; just about everyone copied it. The same goes for many other form factors. The NZXT H1 spans a few alternatives from the competition. Using similar designs isn't a negative as companies can put their spin but it becomes slightly uninspiring for those who are after unique-looking PC cases. There are many out there, but they're often too outlandish. Enter the be quiet! Light Base 600 LX. Meet the PC case that's more than a case It looks like you can keep fish inside, but you shouldn't Standing upright as normal, this chassis looks like many other cases on the market. You've got side and front glass windows, plenty of air intakes and vents, and a standard ATX internal layout. With the Light Base 600 LX, it's all about that two-mode configuration. Underneath the case are four removable feet. These can be swapped out for rubber caps located on the side panel. The feet can then be moved to the side, allowing the entire case to be sat horizontally. When using the case on its side, you're essentially creating an aquarium for all your beloved PC parts. The front and side windows are now the front and top glass panels and these create a cool centerpiece effect. Throw in some RGB lighting and components for added allure. It's clear be quiet! secretly wants you to use the Light Base 600 LX in this mode as all the branding is now level alongside the front I/O. It's better for the desk position too since you're swapping height for width, which should bring the PC back down to existing hardware, including your monitor. So long as you have ample space available on the desk, you'll be able to showcase all your internal components with unobstructed views. I spy some space for a custom open-loop water cooling solution too! Related Best PC cases in 2024 Your new PC deserves a shiny new case to live in, and we've rounded up the best options you can buy depending on what kind of rig you want. Building a PC inside the Light Base 600 is easy Even a novice with no experience can put together a PC Be quiet! is renowned for its catalog of high-performance PC cases and by that I mean they perform well with more powerful hardware. The Light Base 600 LX is no exception here and has excellent thermals. The front, top, and two side panels can be removed to provide as much access to the internals of this chassis, making the process of building a PC incredibly straightforward. Be quiet! went with the dual-chamber layout, separating the power supply from the rest of the case. Usually, these components would be hidden below a shroud of sorts, but it's easier for cable management to have them installed behind the motherboard. For cooling, we've got three fan slots on the side panel, three on the bottom, three more on top, and a single slot on the rear, totaling 10. That's more than enough for handling even the more powerful CPUs from AMD and Intel and allows versatility with AIO liquid cooling installation and placement. The top and bottom panes support radiators up to 360mm with the side taking up to 240mm. Be quiet! includes four Silent Wings blowers with the case, so you only need to bring a further six, three of which can be from a 260mm AIO kit. You'll have plenty of cooling even without an AIO or extra fans. Rubber grommets separate the two chambers and be quiet! included two RGB and fan controller hubs to connect everything and help create a tidy finish. The German company took all of its prior experience and created a truly special PC case, one that's great to look at and enjoyable to use for a PC build. Once everything has been installed and connected, the panels can be returned and the decision now comes to whether you wish to have it vertically standing or horizontally with the desk. Oh, and there's even support for motherboards with backside connectors, just in case you're rocking one of those fancy new motherboards. Your changes have been saved be quiet! Light Base 600 LX",

Take the Lian Li O11 Dynamic, first launched in 2018. This stunning piece of art was unlike anything else on the market; just about everyone copied it. The same goes for many other form factors. The NZXT H1 spans a few alternatives from the competition. Using similar designs isn\u0026#39;t a negative as companies can put their spin but it becomes slightly uninspiring for those who are after unique-looking PC cases.

Underneath the case are four removable feet. These can be swapped out for rubber caps located on the side panel. The feet can then be moved to the side, allowing the entire case to be sat horizontally. When using the case on its side, you\u0026#39;re essentially creating an aquarium for all your beloved PC parts.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe front and side windows are now the front and top glass panels and these create a cool centerpiece effect.

they perform well with more powerful hardware. The Light Base 600 LX is no exception here and has excellent thermals. The front, top, and two side panels can be removed to provide as much access to the internals of this chassis, making the process of building a PC incredibly straightforward. Be quiet! went with the dual-chamber layout, separating the power supply from the rest of the case. Usually, these components would be hidden below a shroud of sorts, but it\u0026#39;s easier for cable management to have them installed behind the motherboard.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFor cooling, we\u0026#39;ve got three fan slots on the side panel, three on the bottom, three more on top, and a single slot on the rear, totaling 10. That\u0026#39;s more than enough for handling even the more powerful CPUs from AMD and Intel and allows versatility with AIO liquid cooling installation and placement. The top and bottom panes support radiators up to 360mm with the side taking up to 240mm. Be quiet! includes four Silent Wings blowers with the case, so you only need to bring a further six, three of which can be from a 260mm AIO kit. You\u0026#39;ll have plenty of cooling even without an AIO or extra fans.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eRubber grommets separate the two chambers and be quiet! included two RGB and fan controller hubs to connect everything and help create a tidy finish. The German company took all of its prior experience and created a truly special PC case, one that\u0026#39;s great to look at and enjoyable to use for a PC build. Once everything has been installed and connected, the panels can be returned and the decision now comes to whether you wish to have it vertically standing or horizontally with the desk.
