  "text": "Google Messages Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Google is testing a new \"@mentions\" feature for group RCS chats in Google Messages. The code was discovered in a beta release but there are no details about how it will work or when it will arrive. This is a basic feature found in almost all other chat apps, including WhatsApp, Telegram, and iMessage. Google Messages may finally get a basic feature found in most other chat apps. It appears Google is working on a mentions feature similar to the one found in WhatsApp and Telegram. Related Google Messages: 18 quick and easy tips for RCS and Chat Get the most out of Google Messages with these simple tricks A recent beta version of the app contains a code that suggests users can tag others with the \"@\" symbol (via Android Authority). This is a basic tool, but incredibly useful in fast-moving group chats, where messages get quickly buried. The tagged recipient of the mention will receive a notification and will see the message when they open the app. Google Messages slowly catching up to the others Source: Android Authority Mentions in group chats seem like a very basic function. WhatsApp, Telegram, iMessage, and even live stream chats on Twitch have had this for years. Google forgot it when it first introduced Messages, but this finally brings the RCS chat app into the modern era. RCS is the one big differentiator with all those other platforms. Google Messages is practically the only name in town when it comes to the modern messaging protocol. Adding the ability to mention other uses makes it that much more useful. It is still unclear how the feature will work. The code reference found by Android Authority doesn't give too much away. The @mentions feature might trigger a special notification, or highlight a message, or even offer additional features like filtering tagged messages. It is still unknown if mentions will work in RCS group chats with iMessage users, but it is likely that Google Messages will follow the same approach as all the other apps. Remember, it is still in testing There's a lot unsaid about this random code in the Google Messages beta. There's no mention of when it will release, or if it will ever see the light of day. Google often tests new features in beta versions of its apps, but not all of them make it to the stable release. That said, this is a basic feature of most chat apps and one that many have been requesting for a long time. Adding @mentions is a logical step for Google, especially considering the company's efforts to make RCS the de-facto messaging protocol of the modern world.",

WhatsApp, Telegram, iMessage, and even live stream chats on Twitch have had this for years. Google forgot it when it first introduced Messages, but this finally brings the RCS chat app into the modern era.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eRCS is the one big differentiator with all those other platforms. Google Messages is practically the only name in town when it comes to the modern messaging protocol. Adding the ability to mention other uses makes it that much more useful.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIt is still unclear how the feature will work. The code reference found by Android Authority doesn\u0026#39;t give too much away. The \u003cstrong\u003e@mentions\u003c/strong\u003e feature might trigger a special notification, or highlight a message, or even offer additional features like filtering tagged messages. It is still unknown if mentions will work in RCS group chats with iMessage users, but it is likely that Google Messages will follow the same approach as all the other apps.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"remember-it-is-still-in-testing\"\u003e\n            Remember, it is still in testing \n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s a lot unsaid about this random code in the Google Messages beta. There\u0026#39;s no mention of when it will release, or if it will ever see the light of day. Google often tests new features in beta versions of its apps, but not all of them make it to the stable release. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003e\nThat said, this is a basic feature of most chat apps and one that many have been requesting for a long time.
