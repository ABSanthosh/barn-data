It's easy to see why, as the new iPhones offer great battery life, a premium fit and finish, and fantastic performance. However, you don't have to run out and buy the shiny new iPhone to get a good experience. Sometimes, if you know what you're looking for, you can snag a great deal on a used phone instead. Of course, there's always a risk with buying any tech product used. You want to make sure the phone is in good condition inside and out, is secure, and has not been reported lost or stolen. There's a lot more to it though, so here's everything to look out for in a used iPhone before handing over your hard-earned money. Related 4 reasons to buy a used laptop instead of a budget alternative If you're on a budget, it might be easy to go for a low-end laptop or Chromebook. But don't rule out used or refurbished machines. 1 Turn it on Look out for the activation lock in particular The most obvious thing to do is turn the iPhone on to see that it boots up properly and isn't locked to a previous owner. If it's locked, this is a telltale sign that the phone is likely stolen. Don't trust a seller who says the battery is just dead. If they claim it's still locked to them until they sell, have them unlock it in front of you to prove ownership. It's good if the phone is still logged in to the original owner's account, since the seller can demonstrate and test all the functionality (more on that below). A knowledgeable seller will wait to erase the phone until it's officially sold. But an honest one will be able to unlock it in any case. 2 Inspect it for physical damage Look out for signs of wear and tear After you turn on the iPhone and are sure that it belongs to the person who's selling it, it's time to inspect the phone for physical damage. A cracked screen is the easiest to spot, but you also want to look for scratches, dents, discoloration, or any other markings. Check the camera lenses as well for visible scratches. You can eyeball all this personally if you are inspecting the phone in person. If you're chatting with a seller online, ask for images of the phone from every angle, with the case removed. Make sure the photos they send include close-up shots or high-resolution photos so you can zoom in to look at the fine details. Don't just brush over minor imperfections. While slight physical damage is usually fine, you can use this as a bargaining chip. Dents, however, suggest that the phone might have experienced a significant bump or drop, which could be a cause for concern. You can also check for water or liquid damage by inspecting the Liquid Contact Indicator. 3 Look for screen burn-in and backlighting issues Fake or third-party iPhone panels are incredibly common Screen burn-in is when an image, like a site logo, permanently burns into the screen. It can happen on your television if you leave a channel like CP24 on for hours with the corner logo that never moves. It can happen with newer iPhones, too, and in fact, was a reported issue with the iPhone 15 Pro Max (it has since been rectified via an iOS update). Chances are you won't notice it during regular use, but once you do, you can become fixated on it. It becomes distracting just knowing it's there. Confirm there's no burn-in by playing a video (there are screen burn-in test videos on YouTube) that scrolls through various solid color backgrounds. As each shade appears, you can inspect to see if you notice any issues with specific colors (pause if you need more time with each shade). You can do the same to check for LCD backlighting issues in older model iPhones that don't use a Super Retina XDR display by bringing up a solid white slide. Keep in mind that the iPhone screen is one of the more expensive components. Damaged phone screens are very common, and, as a result, people often get swindled with fake or third-party panels when they send their iPhones in for repairs. If the colors aren't as vibrant as they should be, or the brightness isn't up to par, the iPhone is probably using a cheap replacement panel. 4 Ask about repairs Watch out for non-genuine parts Source: Apple Ask the seller if the iPhone has ever been repaired, perhaps with a new screen to replace a cracked one or a new battery. If so, ask for a copy of the repair receipt. With this, you can verify the details and ensure the phone was taken to an Apple-authorized repair service provider. Third-party providers without Apple authorization may use unauthorized parts or practices that could impact the phone's usability. For example, a fake iPhone replacement screen might not fit right or could impact touch functionality. Meanwhile, a shoddy battery might not work after a short period or could even damage the device. On an iPhone 11 or later, go to Settings \u003e General \u003e About and look for the Parts And Service History. If the phone has had repairs, this section will be present, and will tell you if the iPhone you're buying has genuine Apple parts. For example, if the device has a non-genuine display, you'll get a message saying \"Unable to verify this iPhone has a genuine Apple display.\" You'll see a similar message regarding battery status in such a case. Any iPhone 12 or newer can give you information about even more components if they've been replaced. Overall though, no news is good news, and this section will not be visible if it's not applicable (if no repairs have been done). 5 Check if the charging port works properly Another common issue with used iPhones Plug in a charging cable to verify that it can charge properly. You can bring along a portable charging bank to make this easier to do on the fly. Peek into the charging port to make sure you don't see any damage (the prongs should not be crooked or depressed) or obstructions inside. Unplug the phone and check that it holds a charge and the battery doesn't start to drain quickly. 6 Ask for receipts Never fall for a stolen iPhone It is becoming all too common for phones to be stolen, reset, and sold secondhand. To avoid getting into a tricky situation whereby you end up with someone else's phone by unknowingly purchasing it from a thief, ask for a copy of the proof of purchase. This can come in the form of a hard copy or an original e-mail receipt. The seller can blur out credit card information but verify that it's their name on the receipt or that they can confirm who the previous owner was (for example, a grandson selling his grandma's old phone). If the phone was financed, make sure to receive confirmation that it has been paid in full. If the seller can't provide the receipt, it might not suggest theft, but could also mean that the phone has already been exchanged multiple times. You can make a judgment call at this point if you want to proceed. 7 Verify the IMEI number This tells you a lot about the phone A phone's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number is like a digital fingerprint for a device. It confirms that the phone is legitimate and keeps track of purchase history, ownership, specs, and more. Ask the seller to tell you what the phone's IMEI number is. They can locate this under Settings, General, About, or dial *#06# to get it (if they still have the box, the IMEI number will be on the back as well). Once you have the 15-digit number, you can look it up on IMEI.info. This will tell you the country, mobile device network, warranty details, system version, and other specs you can match against the details the seller provides. You'll also be able to see if the phone has been reported lost or stolen. If you do unknowingly buy a stolen iPhone, you could be contacted by police if they track it down, required to relinquish it, questioned and asked for proof that you are an innocent third-party buyer who didn't know. So, it's better to be safe than sorry. Note that even if the phone is locked to a specific carrier, you can ask your preferred carrier (if different from the one the phone was purchased from and operated on previously) to unlock the device for you, often for free. However, if there's money owed on the device, they can refuse to do so. So make sure to confirm that the phone, if financed, has been completely paid off. Related How to check an IMEI number and why you should All mobile devices that can connect to cellular networks have IMEI numbers, and here's how you can find them. 8 Verify the serial number Checking warranty, specs, and coverage The serial number is a second tool you can use to verify the authenticity of a secondhand iPhone. Go to Settings, General, About (or ask the seller to do this remotely), and jot down the serial number. With this information, you can find out when the iPhone was activated and whether its official warranty has expired. You can also make sure that the seller's specs are correct and that you're not getting a phone with 128GB storage versus the 256GB they claim. Visit Apple's coverage page as well to see the service and support coverage for the phone. 9 Run hardware tests Don't rush this and check everything you can think of Try out the phone for yourself or ask the seller to do so on a live call or a recorded video so you can verify that things like touch response and physical buttons work. Ask them to update the phone to the latest OS it supports, which would currently be iOS 18 (for iPhones XR and newer), then navigate around the phone using all the common gestures like tap, swipe, and zoom in and out. Visit websites, launch the App Store, check out Maps, look at the Control Center, and select random apps to gauge how quick and efficient it is. Ask them to demonstrate the use of the physical buttons as well (or do this yourself in person). Take a photo, screenshot, and turn the phone on and off. If it's an older-model iPhone that still has a home button, ask them to press it so you can verify that it works. Pay close attention to the responsiveness of the device while they do this. If you have found a used new phone like the iPhone 15 Pro Max, check the side-mounted Action button to make sure it also works. Don't just test the screen and physical buttons: verify that biometrics also work. This includes features like Face ID or Touch ID (you'll have to have the previous owner demonstrate for you). If possible, try out the NFC chip: maybe they can use Apple Wallet to buy a coffee when you meet for the exchange to show you that it works. Alternatively, you could download an app that detects and reads NFC cards and try it on any NFC-enabled item, such as a contactless bank card or NFC sticker. Apps like iDiagnosis can test the phone and check sensors like GPS.

If the cameras in the phone were ever repaired at a non-authorized shop, the phone could now include non-authentic camera parts. Ask the seller to take a few photos and send them to you, or take a few yourself to inspect. This way, you can check the quality of the photos and ensure there are no issues, like cloudiness, graininess, or cracks in the lens. Ask for or take photos using both the front and back cameras. 11 Test the speakers Try making a call to test the earpiece too Even if an iPhone survives water damage and appears to be working fine, it can cause lasting damage to the speakers. iPhone speakers can also malfunction for various other reasons. Testing that the speakers work at full and lower volumes before purchasing a used iPhone is important. Play music or a video and put the speakers on full blast. Also, call the phone so you can check that there isn't any noticeable static. Even if the sale iPhone does not have an active SIM card or eSIM anymore, you can ask the seller to connect it to Wi-Fi or a personal hotspot and make a call using a VoIP app like FaceTime if you're discussing the purchase remotely. 12 Test the microphones A common victim of water damage Hand in hand with the speakers is the microphone. If an iPhone microphone is not working properly, you cannot make a comfortable phone call, record a video or voice notes, or converse with Siri. Ask the seller to record something using the phone that includes their voice and play it back to you so you can hear that it works well. You can also test the microphone while on a call with the person, seeing how well you can hear them and how well they can hear you. Once you meet in person, you can record and listen to a voice memo to hear how audio capture sounds. 13 Check the battery health Anything below 80% is concerning Along with asking about battery repairs and checking that the iPhone accepts a charge once plugged in, you can also see the phone's battery health in the settings menu. Go to Settings \u003e Battery \u003e Battery Health, which will tell you the iPhone's maximum capacity. You can also see a history of charging time, including how long it took for the battery to be charged to a specific level and how often the phone has been charged. Phone batteries deplete over time, so a used phone's battery won't last as long as a brand-new one. My iPhone 14, for example, which I have had for about a year, now has a maximum capacity of 96%. But if the battery health is very low (\u003c80%) that's a red flag. On an iPhone 11 or newer, it will also indicate here if it cannot verify that the iPhone has a genuine Apple battery, and if it cannot, then the battery has probably been replaced with a cheaper non-Apple replacement part. For the iPhone 15 and newer, they also mention the battery's manufacturing date, when it was first used, and cycle count on the About page. This provides even more useful historical data to help you better understand the phone's condition regarding battery health and how actively the iPhone was used by its previous owner. Do your due diligence It might sound strange to request so much from a seller. But anyone who understands the risks of purchasing expensive electronics second-hand will be happy to oblige with your requests. It might take extra effort from both you and the seller, but both parties will be satisfied. They get to sell their phone for what it's worth, and you can rest easy knowing that you aren't buying a phone that will die in a week or that reveals serious defects or issues down the line that were there under the surface when you bought it. It might be tempting to snag a too-good-to-be-true deal on a hot new iPhone, but you should always proceed cautiously. There are risks when buying secondhand, especially from unknown sources. But if you go through this checklist, and it passes every step, you can feel confident you're getting a good phone at a great price. If not, move on to the next seller and save yourself potential grief and lost money from buying a dud. Alternatively, if you feel uncomfortable buying used, you could always go for a certified refurbished iPhone directly from Apple or from a verified retailer like Amazon or Best Buy. If upgrading from an older iPhone, you could check with Apple for a trade-in credit for a discount on the new phone.

If it\u0026#39;s locked, this is a telltale sign that the phone is likely stolen. Don\u0026#39;t trust a seller who says the battery is just dead. If they claim it\u0026#39;s still locked to them until they sell, have them unlock it in front of you to prove ownership. It\u0026#39;s good if the phone is still logged in to the original owner\u0026#39;s account, since the seller can demonstrate and test all the functionality (more on that below). A knowledgeable seller will wait to erase the phone until it\u0026#39;s officially sold.

A cracked screen is the easiest to spot, but you also want to look for scratches, dents, discoloration, or any other markings. Check the camera lenses as well for visible scratches. You can eyeball all this personally if you are inspecting the phone in person. If you\u0026#39;re chatting with a seller online, ask for images of the phone from every angle, with the case removed. Make sure the photos they send include close-up shots or high-resolution photos so you can zoom in to look at the fine details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0026#39;t just brush over minor imperfections.

It can happen with newer iPhones, too, and in fact, was a reported issue with the \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/iphone-15-pro-max-review/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiPhone 15 Pro Max\u003c/a\u003e (it has since been rectified via an iOS update).

As each shade appears, you can inspect to see if you notice any issues with specific colors (pause if you need more time with each shade). You can do the same to check for LCD backlighting issues in older model iPhones that don\u0026#39;t use a Super Retina XDR display by bringing up a solid white slide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eKeep in mind that the iPhone screen is one of the more expensive components. Damaged phone screens are very common, and, as a result, people often get swindled with fake or third-party panels when they send their iPhones in for repairs. If the colors aren\u0026#39;t as vibrant as they should be, or the brightness isn\u0026#39;t up to par, the iPhone is probably using a cheap replacement panel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"ask-about-repairs\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e4 \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Ask about repairs \u003c/span\u003e \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"watch-out-for-non-genuine-parts\"\u003e Watch out for non-genuine parts \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/person-repairing-an-iphone-using-apple-s-self-service-repair-kit.jpg\" data-img-desc=\"\u0026#34;Source: Apple\u0026#34;\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/person-repairing-an-iphone-using-apple-s-self-service-repair-kit.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/person-repairing-an-iphone-using-apple-s-self-service-repair-kit.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/person-repairing-an-iphone-using-apple-s-self-service-repair-kit.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/person-repairing-an-iphone-using-apple-s-self-service-repair-kit.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/person-repairing-an-iphone-using-apple-s-self-service-repair-kit.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/person-repairing-an-iphone-using-apple-s-self-service-repair-kit.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/person-repairing-an-iphone-using-apple-s-self-service-repair-kit.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/person-repairing-an-iphone-using-apple-s-self-service-repair-kit.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003cimg width=\"2100\" height=\"1400\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Person repairing an iPhone using Apple\u0026#39;s Self Service Repair kit.\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/person-repairing-an-iphone-using-apple-s-self-service-repair-kit.jpg\" src=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/person-repairing-an-iphone-using-apple-s-self-service-repair-kit.jpg\"/\u003e \u003c/picture\u003e \u003c/figure\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eSource: Apple\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAsk the seller if the iPhone has ever been repaired, perhaps with a new screen to replace a cracked one or a new battery.

Third-party providers without Apple authorization may use unauthorized parts or practices that could impact the phone\u0026#39;s usability.

To avoid getting into a tricky situation whereby you end up with someone else\u0026#39;s phone by unknowingly purchasing it from a thief, ask for a copy of the proof of purchase. This can come in the form of a hard copy or an original e-mail receipt. The seller can blur out credit card information but verify that it\u0026#39;s their name on the receipt or that they can confirm who the previous owner was (for example, a grandson selling his grandma\u0026#39;s old phone).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the phone was financed, make sure to receive confirmation that it has been paid in full. If the seller can\u0026#39;t provide the receipt, it might not suggest theft, but could also mean that the phone has already been exchanged multiple times. You can make a judgment call at this point if you want to proceed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"verify-the-imei-number\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e7 \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Verify the IMEI number \u003c/span\u003e \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"this-tells-you-a-lot-about-the-phone\"\u003e This tells you a lot about the phone \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA phone\u0026#39;s International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number is like a digital fingerprint for a device. It confirms that the phone is legitimate and keeps track of purchase history, ownership, specs, and more. Ask the seller to tell you what the phone\u0026#39;s IMEI number is. They can locate this under Settings, General, About, or dial *#06# to get it (if they still have the box, the IMEI number will be on the back as well). Once you have the 15-digit number, you can \u003cstrong\u003elook it up on IMEI.info\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis will tell you the country, mobile device network, warranty details, system version, and other specs you can match against the details the seller provides. You\u0026#39;ll also be able to see if the phone has been reported lost or stolen. If you do unknowingly buy a stolen iPhone, you could be contacted by police if they track it down, required to relinquish it, questioned and asked for proof that you are an innocent third-party buyer who didn\u0026#39;t know.

important for smartphones, and you want to make sure they still work properly.

Ask the seller to take a few photos and send them to you, or take a few yourself to inspect. This way, you can check the quality of the photos and ensure there are no issues, like cloudiness, graininess, or cracks in the lens.

Testing that the speakers work at full and lower volumes before purchasing a used iPhone is important. Play music or a video and put the speakers on full blast. Also, call the phone so you can check that there isn\u0026#39;t any noticeable static. Even if the sale iPhone does not have an active SIM card or eSIM anymore, you can ask the seller to connect it to Wi-Fi or a personal hotspot and make a call using a VoIP app like FaceTime if you\u0026#39;re discussing the purchase remotely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"test-the-microphones\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e12 \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Test the microphones \u003c/span\u003e \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"a-common-victim-of-water-damage\"\u003e A common victim of water damage \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/04/iphone-voice-memo-feature.jpg\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/04/iphone-voice-memo-feature.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/04/iphone-voice-memo-feature.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/04/iphone-voice-memo-feature.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/04/iphone-voice-memo-feature.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/04/iphone-voice-memo-feature.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/04/iphone-voice-memo-feature.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/04/iphone-voice-memo-feature.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/04/iphone-voice-memo-feature.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003cimg width=\"2100\" height=\"1400\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"An iPhone on an angle showing a recording in progress in the Voice Memo app.\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/04/iphone-voice-memo-feature.jpg\" src=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/04/iphone-voice-memo-feature.jpg\"/\u003e \u003c/picture\u003e \u003c/figure\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHand in hand with the speakers is the microphone. If an iPhone microphone is not working properly, you cannot make a comfortable phone call, record a video or voice notes, or converse with Siri. Ask the seller to record something using the phone that includes their voice and play it back to you so you can hear that it works well. You can also test the microphone while on a call with the person, seeing how well you can hear them and how well they can hear you. Once you meet in person, you can record and listen to a voice memo to hear how audio capture sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"check-the-battery-health\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e13 \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Check the battery health \u003c/span\u003e \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"anything-below-80-is-concerning\"\u003e Anything below 80% is concerning \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with asking about battery repairs and checking that the iPhone accepts a charge once plugged in, you can also see the phone\u0026#39;s battery health in the settings menu. Go to \u003cstrong\u003eSettings \u0026gt; Battery \u0026gt; Battery Health\u003c/strong\u003e, which will tell you the iPhone\u0026#39;s maximum capacity. You can also see a history of charging time, including how long it took for the battery to be charged to a specific level and how often the phone has been charged. Phone batteries deplete over time, so a used phone\u0026#39;s battery won\u0026#39;t last as long as a brand-new one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy iPhone 14, for example, which I have had for about a year, now has a maximum capacity of 96%. But if the battery health is very low (\u0026lt;80%) that\u0026#39;s a red flag. On an iPhone 11 or newer, it will also indicate here if it cannot verify that the iPhone has a genuine Apple battery, and if it cannot, then the battery has probably been replaced with a cheaper non-Apple replacement part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the iPhone 15 and newer, they also mention the battery\u0026#39;s manufacturing date, when it was first used, and cycle count on the \u003cstrong\u003eAbout\u003c/strong\u003e page. This provides even more useful historical data to help you better understand the phone\u0026#39;s condition regarding battery health and how actively the iPhone was used by its previous owner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"do-your-due-diligence\"\u003e Do your due diligence \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might sound strange to request so much from a seller. But anyone who understands the risks of purchasing expensive electronics second-hand will be happy to oblige with your requests. It might take extra effort from both you and the seller, but both parties will be satisfied. They get to sell their phone for what it\u0026#39;s worth, and you can rest easy knowing that you aren\u0026#39;t buying a phone that will die in a week or that reveals serious defects or issues down the line that were there under the surface when you bought it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt might be tempting to snag a too-good-to-be-true deal on a hot new iPhone, but you should always proceed cautiously. There are risks when buying secondhand, especially from unknown sources. But if you go through this checklist, and it passes every step, you can feel confident you\u0026#39;re getting a good phone at a great price. If not, move on to the next seller and save yourself potential grief and lost money from buying a dud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlternatively, if you feel uncomfortable buying used, you could always go for a certified refurbished iPhone directly from Apple or from a verified retailer like Amazon or Best Buy. If upgrading from an older iPhone, you could check with Apple for a trade-in credit for a discount on the new phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv data-include-community-rating=\"false\"
