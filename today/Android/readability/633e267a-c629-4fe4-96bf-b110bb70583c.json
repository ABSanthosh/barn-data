  "text": "Upgrading is integral to PC building, and is one of the major advantages of building a custom PC. Many users end up swapping components over the course of 5 to 10 years, ending up with a completely new PC at the end, Ship of Theseus style. Although some people consider regular upgrades a drawback of gaming PCs, you don't necessarily have to upgrade every generation. In fact, modern PC components have gotten sufficiently powerful that you can easily make your system last 4 to 5 years without needing an upgrade. How long you should wait between PC upgrades is obviously subjective, but you can use some rules of thumb when taking a long-term view of your brand-new PC. Related Never go in blind: 5 ways to save money when upgrading your gaming PC PC upgrades are inevitable, but you can make the most of them with these simple tips CPU and GPU upgrades The meat of the matter Companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel might try their best to convince you to upgrade every year, but what matters the most is what level of performance you're okay with in the games and programs you typically run. The best time to upgrade is when you start feeling like your PC is struggling to do what you're used to. This could be playing games at 60+ FPS even at low-medium settings, editing a 4K video, or simply opening multiple browser windows at the same time. If you only play easy-to-run titles like Minecraft, Valorant, Dota 2, or indie games at 1080p, even a budget GPU like the GTX 1050 Ti or GTX 1060 can last you around 10 years (people are still using their GTX 1060 today, 8 years after launch). If you're using mid-range GPUs such as the GTX 1070 or RX 5700 at 1080p, you probably like to play a mix of competitive and single-player titles, which would allow you to use the same GPU for around 5 to 6 years comfortably. For high-end shoppers, though, upgrades are usually more frequent, since they demand the same high-end performance at higher resolutions, and end up upgrading every 3 to 4 years. As for CPUs, people usually wait longer between upgrades, sometimes using the same CPU and platform for as long as 10 years. Others usually pair a CPU platform upgrade with a GPU upgrade, mostly upgrading every 4 to 5 years or so. As long as you don't need the best performance in the latest titles and are fine with optimizing in-game settings, you can still make it work with an ancient CPU and a relatively modern GPU. These trends are what people usually do, but if you want a set of rules for when to upgrade, you can stick to the following guidelines: If you have the budget, upgrade your graphics cardevery other generation, which is usually 4 years (e.g. moving from a GTX 1080 to an RTX 3080). If you're saving up, or aren't impressed with the current best offerings, upgrade your GPU every 3rd generation, which is usually 6 years (e.g. moving from a GTX 1080 to an RTX 4080). Upgrade your CPU when it starts to bottleneck your GPU. Waiting for 5 to 6 years between CPU upgrades is an ideal timeframe. The ideal CPU upgrade timeframe lines up nicely with upgrading your GPU every 3rd generation, so you can coincide the two, and invest in a full system upgrade. Alternatively, if your high-end CPU still packs a punch, or the latest CPUs aren't up to snuff, you can choose to upgrade only the graphics card for a more-than-decent boost in gaming performance. Related Should you upgrade your CPU or GPU first? PC struggling to keep up? Here's how to know if it's the CPU or the GPU that needs to be replaced first. Motherboard, RAM, and everything else Mostly dependent on your CPU and GPU The CPU and graphics card matter the most when thinking of PC upgrades. Other components like the motherboard and RAM are linked to your CPU platform and the features you want access to. Components like the CPU cooler and power supply would need upgrading if they're not compatible with your new CPU, or not powerful enough to support your new graphics card. As for storage, capacity or speed might prompt you to upgrade to a new drive. If you're upgrading to a new CPU platform after 6 years or so, you'll most likely need a new motherboard. Even AMD's sockets will probably not last much longer than 5 years. And a memory upgrade will be necessary if the current capacity is not enough for your needs anymore, or the new CPU platform doesn't support the older memory standard. You can easily use a PCIe Gen3 SSD for gaming without needing an upgrade for years, unless you're running out of storage space. You could move to a faster Gen4 or Gen5 SSD along with a future platform upgrade, or you can do a mid-cycle Gen5 SSD upgrade, if your productivity workloads really benefit from it (and if your motherboard supports one). The power supply usually lasts across multiple CPU and GPU generations if you account for extra wattage headroom when building your PC, which we always recommend doing. If not, you'll need to buy a new one that has the wattage, efficiency, and build quality to handle your new graphics card and processor. As for cooling, a great 360mm AIO or high-end air cooler can last you multiple generations of CPUs. A new CPU socket can sometimes necessitate a cooler upgrade if your cooler isn't physically supported anymore, but many times adapter kits are made available to help to keep your old cooler and save some money. Related 3 reasons that SSD speeds don't matter anymore You might think you need the fastest SSDs on the market, but you probably don't The endless cycle of PC upgrades Once you get bitten by the PC building bug, upgrades become part and parcel of your life. Whether it's a single component or an entire PC upgrade, you're always thinking about it, at least at the back of your mind. Waiting for the right time to upgrade your PC, however, allows you to make the most of your existing system, and set you up nicely for the next few years of your PC journey. So, balance your performance needs against your budget, and upgrade accordingly.",
