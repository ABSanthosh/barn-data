The official invite we received says the Galaxy S25 Edge is \"more than a slim smartphone\", with \"every curve, contour, and component\" reflecting \"a breakthrough in precise engineering to create a premium experience worthy of the S series name\".

And of course, the phone will have a ton of AI features, which we already know and love from the other members of the S25 family.",
