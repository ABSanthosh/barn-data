Finding the perfect phone upgrade can be hard. Everyone likes new tech, but not everyone wants to pay what it takes to get it. That's why trade-ins are nice. They take an old phone off your hands and bless you with a newer one at a discount—not all these discounts are considerable, though, so when we see those, we have to showcase them. Well, if you have the right device, you might really like what Samsung has going on for the Galaxy S24 FE. It's a pretty solid device but its original pricing is a little bit on the high side. However, if you could get it for a lot less, would you? You need to ask yourself that, since Samsung is offering a trade-in deal to get the device for up to $400 off. Get the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE at a Massive $400 Discount With an Eligible Trade-In Image: Samsung Samsung's FE, or Fan Edition, smartphones are a great entry point for those who crave the S series experience but aren't ready to pay those flagship prices (that's understandable since flagships cost a lot). The S24 FE was like most of the other FE smartphones we've seen—a somewhat milder S24 recipe (though in terms of non-performance-related specs, it was closest to the S24+). At launch, the Galaxy S24 FE went for $649. To be honest, at that price, it was very hard for me to feel like I could recommend the smartphone to anyone. It didn't bring so much more compared to its predecessor, and the pricing was close enough to the Galaxy S24 that my advice would be to up your budget and get that instead. Image: Samsung However, my stance on the Galaxy S24 FE is majorly a product of its pricing. If the phone was $150 cheaper, it'd be easy for me to call it a good buy. Well, I guess it is extra good, thanks to Samsung's new trade-in deal. Trading in a Galaxy S23, S23+, or S23 FE will knock the price down by $400—compared to a usual trade-in value of $145! That brings the phone down to as low as $249, which is a much easier price tag to swallow. Samsung Will Still Give You a Discount for Trading Older Devices, Even From Other OEMs And hey, even though only the Galaxy S23 FE will give you the maximum discount that Samsung is offering, you can still get some big money off by trading in older smartphones. Image: Samsung For instance, trading in the Galaxy S21 FE will save you $300 (bringing the S24 FE to $349) when it normally would have only saved you $70. With an S20 FE model, that becomes $250, compared to what is usually about $50. There's a lot of money to be saved here, clearly. In fact, any eligible Samsung device that you trade in will get you at least $100, even all the way back to the original Z Flip. You can also trade in devices from other manufacturers, and as long as a device is on the list, you'll get no less than $100 off.
