  "text": "Just recently, smartphone manufacturer Nothing recently hinted that it’s introducing what could very well be a new smartphone on March 4, based on an earlier teaser posted on the brand’s website and social media pages. Following this, the company posted yet another teaser, although this seems to have subverted expectations now. More specifically, a Nothing posted a teaser clip announcing the upcoming “Nothing Phone (3a) Series” on its social media pages. Based on the “a” in the phone’s name, this would very likely mean that it is a budget device, and not a flagship smartphone as originally thought. In an earlier leaked company email from Nothing boss Carl Pei, there was mention of a flagship phone which was supposedly planned for a Q1 launch. Originally shared by tech informant Evan Blass (via his social media page), the leak shows a screenshot of an internal email from Nothing boss Carl Pei himself, which mentions the launch of the Nothing Phone (3) within the year. At this point barely any details about the phone were mentioned, save for changes with the user interface and a new “AI-powered” platform. Of course there’s still the possibility that the company might launch a Nothing Phone 3 and 3a side by side, but until the event goes live, nothing (pun unintended) is official, at least until we get more leaks.",
