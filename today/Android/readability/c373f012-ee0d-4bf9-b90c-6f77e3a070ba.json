  "text": "It’s safe to say that slim smartphones are “in” again, as seen with the launch of the new Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. Measuring in at just 5.8mm thick (or thin) and weighing at 163 grams, the S25 Edge is certainly light and thin, although Samsung did make some considerable changes to set it apart from its other S25 models. But the most embarrassing thing about the phone is that it’s not even as thin as the Moto Z (5.19mm thick) from 9 years ago! Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge pre-order (SAVE $800!) Up front is a 6.7-inch AMOLED display protected by a layer of Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2, surrounded by a titanium frame that goes around its slim chassis. As expected, you do get a smaller battery as well, with a 3,900 capacity cell inside, which supports 25W charging speeds. Interestingly, Samsung managed to cram a vapor chamber inside, which has been redesigned to fit within the confines of the S25 Edge. Another change on the Galaxy S25 Edge is the camera setup, as Samsung has opted to equip the handset with two sensors instead of the usual trio. This means that you’ll be missing out on the telephoto lens on the S25 Edge, although you do get a high-resolution 200MP main camera, which is accompanied by a 12MP ultrawide lens and 12MP selfie camera. One thing that’s carried over from the Edge’s other S25 siblings though is Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which is accompanied by 12GB of RAM and a choice of either 256 or 512GB of internal storage. This setup powers Android 15 on the phone, which comes with One UI 7 as well. Samsung has packed a ton of software onboard the Galaxy S25 Edge, which includes photographic features like the ProVisual Engine, Galaxy AI-powered editing tools like the Audio Eraser and Drawing Assist, and you’re also getting Google Gemini on here with tricks such as Circle to Search and Magic Editor via Google Photos. READ: Galaxy S25 FE chip might surprise everyone As for pricing, the phone is up for pre-order starting today via Amazon, Best Buy, Samsung.com, and major carriers nationwide, starting at $1,099.99 for the 256GB storage configuration and $1,219.99 for the 512GB option. You can get the phone in either Titanium Silver, Titanium Jetblack, and Titanium Icyblue.",
