  "text": "Summary DigiKam is an open-source alternative to Adobe Lightroom with basic editing tools and strong organization features. Immich is a newer self-hosted open-source tool for photo and video storage, offering more control and privacy. DigiKam is easier to set up and use than Immich, which requires self-hosting knowledge, but Immich offers more benefits for security. Immich and DigiKam are two of the most popular open-source photo storage tools, but they offer different ways of storing and managing your visual files. Whether you want a quick setup with the guarantee of open-source security, or you want to host your own server in order to manage your photos, ensuring that everything is your own responsibility during every step, DigiKam and Immich provide the choice. These photo management tools are popular for open-source users and have similar features. Related What is DigiKam? Open-source image file management DigiKam is one of the best open-source alternatives to Adobe Lightroom, which is a proprietary image management and processing tool. With a focus on organization and management of your images, DigiKam has some basic editing tools within it too. With DigiKam, you can view, organize, and tag your photos from your desktop. Without duplicating the entire library of photos, DigiKam creates a database file for tags and metadata, also saving the metadata to the files themselves for use by other applications, all while holding your security. Compared to Google Photos, DigiKam’s tagging and facial recognition works more successfully in identifying image aspects. It’s more customizable and accurate. It also includes a map view or timeline view for browsing your photos in different profiles. Digikam What is Immich? Self-hosted image and video management Launched in 2022, Immich is an open-source and self-hosted software solution for image and video storage and management. From your own server, you can back up, organize, and manage your photos and video files. It offers tools for browsing and searching your photos or videos for easy organization and no loss of privacy, compared to some proprietary photo management tools. Comparatively, Immich is similar to Google Photos, but with more benefits in terms of cost, control, privacy, and storage. Self-hosting requires some knowledge of Virtual Machines (VMs), servers, containers, Proxmox, and plenty more daunting buzzwords. Self-hosted software is best done from a Linux operating system or a Windows computer. Related The definitive roadmap for your self-hosting journey Want to dive into the self-hosting rabbit hole but don't know where to start? We've come up with the perfect roadmap for you! Immich Ease of use Which is the easier photo management tool to use? DigiKam is open-source software that’s ready to go once you make an account. You can install the software on your computer or use the source code to access it in ways that work for you. Because it can be installed as regular software on any Windows, Mac, or Linux system, it’s much easier to set up and use DigiKam rather than Immich. Open-source tools are usually not as easy to use as popular proprietary tools, like Adobe Lightroom, but after a little bit of tinkering, it’s not difficult to understand DigiKam’s features. Since Immich focuses on being a self-hosted open-source tool, you’ll need knowledge and understanding of self-hosting in order to use Immich. Not only is lack of knowledge a barrier to using Immich, but it’s also accessible to fewer operating systems due to its self-hosted nature. Now, if you run a self-hosted server already, it’s likely you don’t run a Mac operating system, and you already know what to do to set up your Immich account to migrate from Google Photos . Using Immich means you rely less on other people to manage your media. With your own hardware, you can set up and host your storage library without relying on external factors. This is one reason, in a time of much uncertainty, that open — source tools are becoming more popular, as people want better privacy control. Platform availability How you can access them DigiKam is a computer-based tool. You won’t find mobile apps for this photo management tool. Like with most open-source software, it works best on Linux, Windows, and macOS, but with no or limited support for other platforms unless you make a fork of the repository yourself. Immich is best run from Linux machines, for the best success. Using a virtual machine, you can install and self-host, then access your server from the Immich mobile apps on both iOS and Android. From the phone apps, you can access all the images and videos you host through Immich. Windows and Mac users can access Immich using Docker, but the results are poorer than running directly from Linux. Management features How you can manage your files DigiKam stores your files in albums, which are identical to the folders on your hard disk. DigiKam offers export settings for most formats, allowing you to convert to lossless JPEG-XL, WEBP, and AVIF while importing from a camera. The batch queue manager allows you to assign labels automatically, as well as assign ratings, pick, and colors to image batches, as well as letting you run G’MIC filters to them. There are advanced search and rename features, offering sequential name properties and allowing you to search for images with or without a number of facial regions in images. Immich allows metadata through Exif, which helps you search your images and categorize them. Image tagging and album sharing were two of the earliest commits for Immich, centering browsing functions on a level of importance to the tool, including backup options for iOS and Android for ultra-security. Immich has more support for video formats than DigiKam, allowing you to store and manage a multitude of file formats rather than solely image-based. You can tag both images and videos for better browsing and search functionality. While both Immich and DigiKam are focused on organizing and managing your files, there’s a benefit to them having editing tools, too. DigiKam has some basic image editing features, all of which apply to images in the batch queue for multi-photo editing. You’ll find tools to edit color, such as the channel mixer, hue, saturation, and lightness, and the color balance tool. There are also enhancement transform, decorate, and filter tools available. Immich has basic editing features, such as crop and rotate. There are also a few simple adjustment editing tools which use CSS filters. You’ll find brightness and contrast features, as well as slightly elevated editing tools like white balance, black level, and image temperature, but nothing more complex than that. Related 6 open-source photo management tools that rival Google Photos Don't let Google Photos control your photo storage and management DigiKam is better for photo management DigiKam offers security and privacy, but compared to Immich — which offers the same — it’s much easier to use. While the act of self-hosting your photo management server with Immich may bring more satisfaction, it’s a significant barrier to entry for the average user who just wants to back up their image libraries with guaranteed privacy and security. DigiKam is straightforward to install and use, and it reports editing tools, batch processes, and RAW support. While Immich benefits from accompanying mobile apps, you can’t get to them without already setting up your self-hosted Immich account, which may be difficult for some users.",

2022, Immich is an open-source and self-hosted software solution for image and video storage and management. From your own server, you can back up, organize, and manage your photos and video files. It offers tools for browsing and searching your photos or videos for easy organization and no loss of privacy, compared to some proprietary photo management tools.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eComparatively, Immich is similar to Google Photos, but with more benefits in terms of cost, control, privacy, and storage.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSelf-hosting requires some knowledge of Virtual Machines (VMs), servers, containers, Proxmox, and plenty more daunting buzzwords.

You can install the software on your computer or use the source code to access it in ways that work for you. Because it can be installed as regular software on any Windows, Mac, or Linux system, it’s much easier to set up and use DigiKam rather than Immich.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOpen-source tools are usually not as easy to use as popular proprietary tools, like Adobe Lightroom, but after a little bit of tinkering, it’s not difficult to understand DigiKam’s features.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003e\nSince Immich focuses on being a self-hosted open-source tool, you’ll need knowledge and understanding of self-hosting in order to use Immich. Not only is lack of knowledge a barrier to using Immich, but it’s also accessible to fewer operating systems due to its self-hosted nature.

DigiKam is straightforward to install and use, and it reports editing tools, batch processes, and RAW support. While Immich benefits from accompanying mobile apps, you can’t get to them without already setting up your self-hosted Immich account, which may be difficult for some users.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
