As such, you might want to check out what Samsung is offering with the Galaxy S24 FE. Part of its “FE” line of devices, it comes with some key specifications which give it an edge over cheaper Samsung devices like the A-series phones. The phone features a 6.7-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and a triple-camera setup consisting of a 50MP main camera, a 12MP ultrawide camera, and an 8MP telephoto camera, complemented by a 10MP selfie camera in front. Powering the device is a 4,700 mAh battery which supports 25W charging speeds. For software, there’s Android 14 onboard with One UI 6.1, and Samsung does include its usual suite of AI-powered software features.
