With that in mind, the company recently announced the upcoming launch of its first-ever Game Boy model, which depending on your age is all sorts of awesome. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Review (SAVE $400!) READ: Another Nintendo Game Franchise gets the LEGO Treatment With a total of 421 pieces, the LEGO Game Boy set closely mimics the original Nintendo Gameboy, with the company claiming that it’s a 1:1 size copy—this includes the colour scheme, all the way down to the button placement, cartridge slot, and even a power switch on top. The buttons also respond to presses, which is a cool detail. The set also comes with a couple of cartridges based on The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening and Super Mario Land, and they even lock into place with a satisfying click. The display also resembles the one found on the original Game Boy, with a replaceable filter that’s made to look like the handheld’s black and white display, complete with a “moving” visual effect of sorts. The only caveat is that the set does not function as an actual Game Boy (obviously), but it’s a neat addition to one’s LEGO collection, especially for folks who grew up with Nintendo’s highly-popular landmark handheld console. It retails for $59.99. A writer and content creator with a love for tech and music, Mike is also an avid gamer as well. He and his wife are big fans of Mario Kart.
