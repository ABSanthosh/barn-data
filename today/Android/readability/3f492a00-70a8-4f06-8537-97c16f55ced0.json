However, the move appears to be part of larger changes to Google Assistant. The voice assistant has seen numerous feature deprecations since the start of 2024, and will soon be replaced on mobile with Gemini.Eventually, Gemini will replace Google Assistant on Wear OS, at least in name. But since Fitbit smartwatches run Fitbit OS — not Wear OS — it's far from guaranteed that Gemini will arrive on older Fitbit watches.Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of AndroidAmidst the announcement of the discontinuation of Assistant on Fitbit watches, there has been no official mention of a voice assistant replacement, aside from the aforementioned Alexa support.
