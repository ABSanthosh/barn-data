Some value privacy, while others require offline, GPS-only functionality for frequent international travel. Whatever is important to you, we’ve got you covered with these eight great Google Maps alternatives. Most of these apps are free to download. Many of their features are free, but there may be subscription pricing via in-app purchases to access some advanced features. Related 7 Google Maps features I can’t live without Life's easier with these Google Maps features 8 Mapquest Old school, new school cool Though it rightfully earns its spot on this list, MapQuest is somewhat of a nostalgia pick for me. I’m “Thomas Guide” years old, and when I moved to web-based driving directions, it was Mapquest for me. I’d plan my route, print it, and take it in the car. You won’t waste paper with its Android and iOS mobile apps. MapQuest identifies your current location. When you want to go somewhere, type it in and tap Get Directions to make it happen. With your directions, you’ll see the current traffic conditions, distance to destination, and an estimate of fuel costs for your trek. 7 Private Maps by MapQuest Get what you pay for See above for the features, except this version of MapQuest DOES NOT sell your data to third parties. This version also does not track you or keep cookies or history, so you don’t need to go into the settings to delete any of that. Also, no ads. The only downside is that this privacy costs $4.99 a week or $29.99 a year after a three-day trial. 6 Apple Maps Still worth a mention Source: Apple Apple Maps was rotten when it launched. Some products need time to mature, and that’s what happened here. Apple Maps is one of the best apps for respecting users’ privacy. It will get you where you need to go without navigating you off the road and into a pond like it did to some users in 2012. Apple’s support page states that if you’re logged in to your Apple account, data synced across devices is end-to-end encrypted. When you perform tasks like making a navigation or directions request, a random identifier is created and exists for the duration of your navigation session. Other identifiers used for other functionality are not tied to your Apple account, with some rotating multiple times per hour. 5 CityMapper By bus, by foot, or by ferry CityMapper is a more narrowly focused app than Google Maps or MapQuest. While much of the United States is not walkable or public transportation-friendly, many other parts of the world are. That’s where CityMapper excels. This Android and iOS app keeps an updated database of public routes in important cities around the world. It also supports Uber integration, so you can book transport without leaving the app. My favorite feature is the Walk Less routing. This mode helps you avoid rain, heat, or humidity by showing your routes with the least walking, ranked by the duration of the outdoor walk. The app is ad-supported. You can remove the ads by subscribing for $1.49 per month or $9.99 annually. 4 OpenStreet Map This web mapping tool for casual use is open source and built by a community of mappers who contribute and maintain data about roads, trails, railway stations, and more worldwide. When you enter the origin and the destination, you get a downloadable map you can save to your phone for offline viewing. It doesn’t track your location and is privacy-conscious. Another significant aspect of OpenStreet Map, or OSM, is that it feeds data from other mapping software that offers turn-by-turn navigation, which OSM doesn’t do. 3 OsmAnd Offline GPS and world maps Though not the most visually appealing on this list, this customizable navigation app doesn’t collect user data. You’re in control of the data the app can access. It has a bit of a learning curve, though. OsmAnd allows you to record routes using GPX tracks. The free version has the usual navigation features. Subscriptions add Android Auto support, unlimited map downloads, topo data, nautical depths, weather plugins, cloud support, and more. Version 4.9 for Android launched in November 2024 and added features like a vehicle metrics plugin via your car’s OBD-II port, a dirt bike trails route layer, and a full-screen view for Wikimedia points of interest images. 2 Here WeGo Formerly Here Maps Here WeGO has an impressive pedigree. It’s the in-car navigation system for Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW. The app is available on Android and iOS and as a web interface, which, unlike Google Maps, allows you to download an offline map of an entire continent. The app supports walking guidance and turn-by-turn directions. It also finds parking at your destination and guides you to it. You can also add waypoints for your trips. Here WeGo received a major update on December 4, 2024. 1 Maps.Me Great for hiking trails around the world If you experience wanderlust, this navigation app is what the cartographer ordered. It informs you of the popular places in a new city and has a large, global database of hiking trails that are updated regularly. Like many global apps, an internet connection isn’t required, and you get driving, walking, and bike navigation anywhere in the world. This product sources its data from OpenStreetMap, and you can share your location with friends and family via text message or social media. One handy feature I like is the ruler that allows you to find the distance between multiple points on a map. End of the line If you use your mobile navigation to get to often unexplored places, be prepared for the weather. Check out our list of the best weather apps. These apps are better than the one you’ll find on your phone.",

Some products need time to mature, and that’s what happened here. Apple Maps is one of the best apps for respecting users’ privacy. It will get you where you need to go without navigating you off the road and into a pond like it did to some users in 2012.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eApple’s support page states that if you’re logged in to your Apple account, data synced across devices is end-to-end encrypted. When you perform tasks like making a navigation or directions request, a random identifier is created and exists for the duration of your navigation session. Other identifiers used for other functionality are not tied to your Apple account, with some rotating multiple times per hour.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"citymapper\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e5 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            CityMapper\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"by-bus-by-foot-or-by-ferry\"\u003e\n            By bus, by foot, or by ferry\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eCityMapper is a more narrowly focused app than Google Maps or MapQuest. While much of the United States is not walkable or public transportation-friendly, many other parts of the world are. That’s where CityMapper excels.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThis Android and iOS app keeps an updated database of public routes in important cities around the world. It also supports Uber integration, so you can book transport without leaving the app. My favorite feature is the Walk Less routing. This mode helps you avoid rain, heat, or humidity by showing your routes with the least walking, ranked by the duration of the outdoor walk. The app is ad-supported.

The app supports walking guidance and turn-by-turn directions. It also finds parking at your destination and guides you to it. You can also add waypoints for your trips.
