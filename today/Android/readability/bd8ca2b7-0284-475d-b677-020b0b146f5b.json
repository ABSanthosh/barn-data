You might remember that there was a point early last year when a bunch of Chinese smartphone manufacturers were racing to include 5.5G support on their smartphones. Some had the hardware to support it and only needed to roll out an update to enable it for users. However, 5.5G really only mattered to Chinese users at that time. 5.5G, also known as 5G Advanced, was expected to find its way to the US eventually, and a full month after the fact, it is here. T-Mobile has just announced that it has rolled out its 5G Advanced network across the entire country, which should give you significantly improved speeds and latency on the internet. T-Mobile Beats the Others as the First US Carrier to Support 5G Advanced Nationwide Image: T-Mobile When it comes to cellular technology, there's never such a thing as too much speed. Even though 5G is plenty fast for most of us, the networks are still setting their sights on 6G, which will make things even faster than we're already used to. However, before we get to that point, it seems that carriers have decided to make a pit stop midway. This is where 5.5G, or 5G-Advanced comes in. Image: T-Mobile You can think of 5G-Advanced as a transitional phase between 5G and 6G. Early last year, smartphone manufacturers were doing what they could to ensure that their devices were ready for 5.5G, particularly in China. Now, it has finally arrived in the United States, thanks to T-Mobile. The carrier has just launched 5.5G in the United States, and it is available nationwide, which is fantastic. Here are some of the points of note: Enhanced and Enriched Experience: High speeds, lower latency Intent-based Experience: More consistent connectivity AI-Scaled Experience: Improved power consumption and resource allocation Pervasive Experience: Improved connectivity to wearables, IoT devices, smart infrastructure, etc. Some Popular Phones Don't Have the Hardware to Use 5G Advanced Image: Samsung 5G-Advanced is good news for anyone who loves faster internet speeds. Sure, it's nice for that video on Facebook to load a bit quicker, but people who do a lot of video conferencing, play a lot of video games, or engage frequently with AR/VR applications, will enjoy the improvements and lower latency the most. However, it is important to keep in mind that you'll need specific hardware to enjoy this new T-Mobile network. 5.5G won't simply work on phones that already have 5G support. You will need a device that is specifically built to handle 5G-Advanced. The good thing is that isn't quite rare, but the bad thing is that there are a bunch of notable chipsets which do not support the standard.
