The S30 could have a 6,500mAh battery, while the Pro mini will get a Dimensity 9400e SoC. Huawei's MateBook Fold Ultimate has the body of a 13-inch laptop, but is actually an 18-inch foldable. The bottom part of the display can display a virtual on-screen keyboard (or whatever you want). The laptop weighs just 1.16kg, and is 14.9mm thick when closed (7.3mm when opened). The display is quite impressive – it has 4:3 aspect ratio when opened (3,296 x 2,472px) and 3:2 when in laptop form (2,472 x 1,648px resolution of the “display”). It’s a dual-layer OLED LTPO panel that pumps out a powerful 1,600 nits and has 1,440Hz high-frequency PWM dimming. The dual-layer structure reduces power usage by 30% while tripling the expected life of the panel. It is protected by a non-Newtonian fluid and a carbon fiber support layer. The Huawei MateBook Pro also launches on June 6, starting at CNY 8,000 ($1,110/€985/₹95,000) for the 24GB/512GB model. Xiaomi announced the 15S Pro, which premiered its new in-house chipset - the Xring O1. The SoC is the real story, as the phone is otherwise identical to the 15 Pro. Developed and designed by Xiaomi and fabbed on TSMC’s second-generation N3E 3nm process, Xring O1 features a ten-core CPU cluster with 2x Cortex-X925 prime cores clocked @ 3.9GHz, 6x Cortex-A725 performance cores between 1.9-3.4 GHz and 2x Cortex-A520 efficiency cores @ 1.8 GHz. The CPU is joined by a 16-core ARM Immortalis-G925 GPU and a 6-core NPU rated at 44 TOPS. Xiaomi revealed that its flagship SoC scored over 3 million points on the AnTuTu benchmarking platform, edging out the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Xring O1 also managed over 3,000 single core points and 9,000 multi-core points in Geekbench 6, with the multi-core score edging out Apple’s A18 Pro. Xring O1 supports the latest LPDDR5T RAM, UFS 4.1 storage, USB 3.2 Gen2 connectivity, Wi-Fi 7, and a custom 3-core Xiaomi ISP. The Xiaomi 16 is coming in September with the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 SoC. We saw the first CAD-based renders of Xiaomi's next flagship, and it appears similar to its predecessor. The Xiaomi 16 is apparently going to have an enormous 6,800 mAh battery with support for 100W wired charging. It's also claimed to have the best screen for a device of its size. Infinix's Hot series will continue with the slimness trend - the Hot 60 Pro+ will be under 6mm, and will be the thinnest curved phone, Per Ice Universe. We put the new vivo X200 Ultra against its predecessor in a stills camera battle. The new phone has an interesting new 35mm camera, a superior 14mm ultrawide, and a slightly improved 85mm zoom. The OnePlus 13s will launch in India on June 5. The phone is being launched in India in three colors, two of which we are familiar with from the OnePlus 13T. These include the Black Velvet and the Pink Satin. India, however, gets an additional exclusive color called Green Silk but does not get the gray color of the 13T. The green and pink models have a new soft touch finish that is dubbed Velvet Glass. No word on pricing just yet.",
