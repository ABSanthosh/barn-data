EVGA has been making PC accessories for some time and is quite a reputable brand. If that wasn\u0026#39;t enough, and word of mouth never really is, the brand throws in a ten-year warranty to back its PSU, which should provide some peace of mind. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
