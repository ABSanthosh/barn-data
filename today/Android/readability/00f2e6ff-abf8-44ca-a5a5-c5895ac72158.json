This also means hearing aid presets, available within your phone settings, can be conveniently applied to broadcasts to personalize streams to your hearing. And expanding on our work with Bluetooth SIG to use the latest LE Audio technology, we’re bringing to Pixel 9 devices the ability to connect to broadcasts through QR codes – removing the need to go into your settings.To use Auracast, pair LE Audio compatible hearing aids from companies like GN Hearing and Starkey with your Samsung Galaxy devices with One UI 7 and Android 15 or Pixel 9 devices running the Android 16 beta and tune into Auracast broadcasts from compatible TV streamers or public venues.",
