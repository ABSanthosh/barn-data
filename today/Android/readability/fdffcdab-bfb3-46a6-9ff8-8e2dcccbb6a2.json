But it could take longer, and Apple can also decide against it in the future - no official announcement has been made on the matter, even though Apple's Craig Federighi did suggest in the past that the company would like to offer integration with other AI models, including Google's. In the meantime, Apple has officially confirmed that Apple Intelligence will finally become available in the EU in April with the release of iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4, which is also when the AI suite will get support for more languages.",
