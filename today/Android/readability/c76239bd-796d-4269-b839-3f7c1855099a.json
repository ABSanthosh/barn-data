That would make it the thinnest book-style foldable ever when unfolded, beating even the current king, Oppo's Find N5, which is 4.2mm thick. Today he's back with the Fold7's full dimensions, which are said to be 158.4 x 143.1 x 3.9 mm when unfolded. Compared to its predecessor, it's taller and wider, and of course thinner. It obviously also beats the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition, which was so far Samsung's thinnest foldable. The inner folding screen's bezels will also be thinner, according to the same source. Pictured below is the Fold6's bezel, which allegedly measures 1.9mm. The Fold7 will take that down to a rather incredible 1mm, while the Flip7's bezel will be 1.2mm. So with all of this in mind, it seems like Samsung has finally noticed that its Chinese competitors have it really beat when it comes to foldable device thinness, and decided to actually compete on this spec. Unfortunately, the battery capacity will remain the same 4,400 mAh in the Fold7 as in its predecessor - perhaps we have to wait another year for Samsung to get that memo too.
