Just add your favorite smart doorbell to your cart and check out! Also, the discounts apply regardless of the color version you pick.Blink Video Doorbell: Best bang per buck If you want to optimize the value of your dollar, the Blink Video Doorbell is a better deal. It’s still a really good smart doorbell, and it costs a mere $32.99.The Blink Video Doorbell can record at 1,080p and has a 135-degree horizontal field of view. It still has most of the main features you could want, such as night vision, two-way audio, motion alerts, and Alexa support.This model doesn’t have an integrated battery, but uses a couple of AA batteries, and you can buy rechargeable AA batteries. This won’t be something you really need to worry about, though, as battery life can last up to two years!Ring Video Doorbell: A nice upgrade While the Blink offer is fantastic, the Ring Video Doorbell is also nicely priced right now, at $59.99. You’ll be nicely rewarded if you decide to upgrade, though. This one gets a 1,440p resolution and a wider 150-degree horizontal field of view. It also comes with an integrated battery, which you can charge over USB-C, and can last 6-12 months.This model also comes with two-way audio, motion alerts, night vision, and Alexa support. Additionally, you will enjoy some extras, such as person recognition, package alerts, and custom motion zones.You’ll also need a subscription to access all the features.
