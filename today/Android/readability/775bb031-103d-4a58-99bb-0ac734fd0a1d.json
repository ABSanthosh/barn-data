Before, you needed to tap \"Summarize this email\" at the top of a message in order to get this functionality that is now on by default and automatic. The feature is currently only rolling out for emails in English. For those emails that aren't flagged by Gemini as being ones where a summary would be helpful, it won't be automatically generated but you can still manually prompt it by tapping the Summarize this email chip at the top. The rollout to everyone is expected to take up to 15 days. Note that this will only be available, for now, to Google Workspace subscribers, Google One AI Premium subscribers, and customers with Gemini Education or Gemini Education Premium. Source",
