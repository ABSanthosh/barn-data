This will be in development for a while longer, so don't expect to get it right away.

Normally, WhatsApp auto-saves every media item you receive on your phone. But when this is implemented, you'll have the option to prevent other people's phones from doing that, as seen in the screenshot above. This is the same behavior that already applies to disappearing messages. The new bit here is that you will be able to set it for normal messages and associated media as well. The feature will also restrict exporting entire chat histories for chats with users who have activated this new setting. This won't prevent message forwarding, though. Additionally, if you enable this \"advanced chat privacy\", participants in a chat with you won't be able to use Meta AI in any way. Of course, WhatsApp could add even more stuff to this feature while it's in development. Anyway, when it does launch for everyone, it will be opt-in. Source",
