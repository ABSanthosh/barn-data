It looks like the Pixel 6a is the latest phone to fall prey to an unfortunately familiar hardware issue. READ: Pixel 9a battery issue raises concerns about long-term repairability Following reports that a considerable number of Pixel 6a units were catching fire, Google now says that it will roll out a software update which will effectively handicap the Pixel 6a’s battery by reducing its charging speed and capacity after 400 cycles. A statement from Google made to the folks over at Android Authority reads: A subset of Pixel 6a phones will require a mandatory software update to reduce the risk of potential battery overheating. The update will enable battery management features that will reduce capacity and charging performance after the battery reaches 400 charge cycles. We’ll contact impacted customers next month, with all the information they need to address the issue. Months earlier, the company also rolled out a software update for the much older Pixel 4a, which resulted in some issues with the phone’s overall performance afterwards. This was then followed by battery issues on the Pixel 7a, which led to Google offering affected users  monetary compensation (or free repairs in some cases).
