MediaTek started the first quarter (Q1) of 2025 with speed, and has launched many powerful chipsets already. Adding to its mid-range chip lineup is the Dimensity 7400 series that will introduce artificial intelligence from high-end devices to the more affordable ones.  At the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2025, the goal became grander with the launch of 6G, 5G-Advanced, and AI-powered computing technologies. The company shows off a hybrid system that mixes communication and computing to make intelligent processing faster and private at the same time. Here's how it has achieved that. MediaTek has worked hard to refine 6G, 5G-Advanced, AI-powered computing, and satellite internet technologies in partnership with Nvidia, Intel, and G Reigns. Among their many promising endeavours is an improvement to satellite internet (NR-NTN) to enable phones to stay connected even in places with no cell towers. That means no more dependence on ground networks as your device communicates directly with satellites no matter where you are. Image: MediaTek We’re pushing forward industry-leading connectivity and AI applications through high-quality products and global standardization, which create significant new opportunities to enrich everyday living for more people around the world. This is exemplified by our most recent developments in leading-edge 6G-era technologies, generative AI hybrid computing, and 5G-Advanced solutions, which will be on display this week. Joe Chen, President of MediaTek. Right now, your phone relies on its own processor to handle AI tasks. Signal drops are also issues ingrained into our lifestyle that we want to see less of henceforth. MediaTek ‘s hybrid computing, sub-band full duplex (SBFD), low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite broadband trials, and other innovations let nearby network infrastructure do all the work quicker. You could be on a crowded train, in a rural area, or just walking through a dead zone and still be connected to the world. AI is moving to smart homes and cars In combination with the aforementioned technologies, there's a new M90 5G Advanced modem that supports speeds up to 12Gbps. It also pairs with multiple frequency bands at once (FR1+FR2), and includes AI-powered Smart Antennas that adjust based on how you hold your phone. If your hand blocks the antenna, it's not the end of your connection as the system automatically bounces the signal to another part of the device. Image: MediaTek That aside, on-device processing isn’t the only way to expand AI’s reach because it’s limited by a device’s power and hardware. As MediaTek looks into how it can be useful across different devices, it’s working on a Generative AI Gateway and Context Synchronization system. Beyond smartphones, there'll come a time when we'll start seeing more smart home devices, routers, and other connected gadgets handling intelligent tasks together. They're also coming to cars with Dimensity Auto, designed to power next-gen in-car systems. Image: MediaTek It's a platform designed to make your infotainment system smarter with key features including the multiple virtual machines (VMs) running on a hypervisor. Each function operates in its own virtual space and shares resources more efficiently. The eCockpit is another major highlight that brings you an 8K display.
