  "description": "According to a new report from Korea-based Hana Securities, Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra is by far the most popular member of the family. So much so, in fact, that it's outsold both of its siblings combined. In the first two months of availability, Samsung allegedly sold 9.16 million Galaxy S25 units across all three models. Of those, a whopping 5.08 million units are Galaxy S25 Ultra devices, more than half. The Galaxy S25 follows with 2.41 million units and the S25+ is in third with 1.67 million. Combined, the S25 and S25+ sold 1 million fewer units than the S25 Ultra. So maybe it's...",

Combined, the S25 and S25+ sold 1 million fewer units than the S25 Ultra. So maybe it's time for the Plus model to go? Apple found itself in a similar situation and decided to bury the Plus and release the iPhone 17 Air instead. Samsung has the S25 Edge coming but as a fourth member of the family, not a replacement for any of its members. It will be interesting to see if the Edge manages to outsell the S25+, with which it shares the screen size - but it's obviously thinner, and also misses out on a dedicated telephoto camera (then again, it has a better main camera). While this may be surprising given the fact that the Ultra is the most expensive of the bunch, it actually kind of makes sense - it's Samsung's all-out, no-holds-barred flagship, whereas the other models both have compromises, so if you're looking for the ultimate Samsung smartphone experience, only the Ultra can deliver that. And on a payment plan, it's not that much more expensive per month than either of its siblings. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Samsung Galaxy S25 Samsung Galaxy S25+ Via",
