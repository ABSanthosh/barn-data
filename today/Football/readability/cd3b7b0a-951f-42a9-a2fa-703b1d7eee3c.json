  "text": "Verdict: Goias win Best Odds: 19/20 Bookmaker: Luckster Two sides who find themselves scrapping it out at opposite ends of the Serie B standings, Goias will welcome Criciuma to the Serrinha late on Tuesday night. Goias Starting with the hosts, while Goias might have suffered real heartbreak last season as they eventually fell short of a top-four finish, the Big Green havenâ€™t shown any signs of a hangover this time around. Making a return to winning ways last week as they secured a 2-1 victory away at Chapecoense, Vagner Manciniâ€™s men are pencilled in as a standout promotion contender in 2025. Knowing that they can climb to the top of the table here, the Verdao have suffered just a pair of defeats from any of their previous 10 Serie B appearances – a run that stems all the way back to April 21st. Getting June underway with a 2-0 win against Volta Redonda, Goias should also be excited by their overall success on home soil. Despite being last seen at the Serrinha slumping to a 2-1 defeat against Athletic Club, Tuesdayâ€™s hosts have won all of their other four matchups in front of their own supporters. Goias Team News Once again missing out on Manciniâ€™s travelling squad last week, former Internacional defender Lucas Ribeiro is not expected to feature here. However, aside from the 26-year-old, Goias have reported a clean bill of health. Bagging a sensational last-gasp winner against Chapecoense last week and registering a fourth Serie B strike of the season, veteran marksman Anselmo Ramon will spearhead Goiasâ€™ charge in the final third. Criciuma As for the visitors, watching their extended purple patch come to an abrupt end last week as they eventually fell to a 2-1 loss at home against Avai, Criciuma are desperately seeking an immediate response here. Still firmly looking over their shoulder at the drop zone and opening Tuesdayâ€™s showdown holding just a two-point buffer, Eduardo Baptistaâ€™s side have also continued to show some real issues outside of Santa Catarina. Crashing out of the Copa do Brasil on May 23rd as they fell to a woeful 6-0 drumming at the hands of Bragantino, Criciuma have registered just a single win from any of their previous seven showdowns away from the Heriberto Hulse – a run that stems back to March 11th. Likewise, hit with a 1-0 defeat when they last travelled to Goias back in March 2022, Baptistaâ€™s side are pencilled in as a real underdog contender in midweek. Criciuma Team News Shown a straight red card at home against Avai last week, former Bahia defender Marcinho will miss out through suspension here. Not making a single appearance across any competition since the end of April, one-time Bragantino striker Gabriel Novaes remains on the sidelines. Bagging what turned out to be a consolation strike in Santa Catarina last week and now registering consecutive Serie B strikes, Jhonata Robert will partner former Vitoria man Matheus Trindade in the middle of the park. Goias vs Criciuma Key Factors to Consider When Goaias and Criciuma last met at the Serrinha back in March 2022, Tuesdayâ€™s hosts collected a 1-0 victory. In fact, Goias are unbeaten in all of their last nine straight home meetings against the Tigers (six wins, three draws). Goias have collected 12 points from their last five Serie B showdowns in front of their own supporters. Criciuma have mustered just a sole win from any of their previous seven matchups outside of Santa Catarina. Tuesdayâ€™s guests have recorded just a sole Serie B clean sheet on their travels so far this season. Conclusion Making a welcomed return to winning ways last week as they snatched a sensational last-gasp 2-1 win away at Chapecoense, Goias will be excited to make a return to home soil here. Knowing that they can climb to the top of the Serie B table on Tuesday night, the midweek hosts have registered 12 points from their previous five showdowns at the Serrinha. Landing a 1-0 victory when they last welcomed Criciuma to town back in 2022 and unbeaten in all of their last nine straight home fixtures against Tuesdayâ€™s guests, we are backing a home win. Verdict: Goias win Best Odds: 19/20 Bookmaker: Luckster",
