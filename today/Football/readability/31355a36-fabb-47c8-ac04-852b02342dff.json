Los Blancos had looked to be cruising into the final four, but Dortmund scored twice in stoppage time on either side of Kylian Mbappe’s overhead kick, with Dean Huijsen also sent off in the closing stages. Gonzalo Garcia got Madrid off to a brilliant start just 10 minutes in as he leapt to meet Arda Guler’s hooked cross on the volley, and Gregor Kobel could not keep out the close-range shot despite making himself big. Fran Garcia then doubled their lead 10 minutes later; Dortmund got caught playing out from the back, and Trent Alexander-Arnold’s low cross deflected to the left-back, who guided his low effort into the net. Jude Bellingham came inches away from adding another against his former side, fizzing a low drive past the right post just before half-time. Mbappe entered the fray from the bench in the second half and could have added a third for Madrid as he tried to catch Kobel from a tight angle on the right, but the goalkeeper spread himself well. Dortmund looked to be going out of the Club World Cup with a whimper, but Maximilian Beier snuck a low strike past Thibaut Courtois into the bottom-left corner to pull one back in the 92nd minute. Mbappe then restored Madrid’s two-goal cushion two minutes later, as he met Guler’s right-side cross with a brilliant overhead kick at the far post, seemingly putting his side back in control. But there was more drama yet to come. Serhou Guirassy was through on goal when he was dragged back inside the box by Huijsen, who was shown a straight red card. Guirassy made no mistake from 12 yards in the 98th minute, firing high into the net, giving Courtois no chance. With the momentum back in their favour, Dortmund attempted to force the game into extra time. Marcel Sabitzer almost did just that with a fine volley from just inside the box, but Courtois tipped it wide of the post with the final touch of the game. Madrid will now face Paris Saint-Germain in the final four on Wednesday. Late drama at MetLife Stadium but @realmadrid claim the win. #FIFACWC — FIFA Club World Cup (@FIFACWC) July 5, 2025 Data Debrief: Madrid’s Club World Cup dominance continues Madrid have played 20 matches at the Club World Cup (including previous formats), and they are yet to be defeated in the competition. They have won 17 of those games (D3), and since 2014, have won 15 of 16 matches, only failing to do so against Al-Hilal in the group stage this year (1-1). And Gonzalo Garcia has played a big part in keeping that run going. He is the only player to directly contribute to a goal in all of his team’s matches (five) in this year’s tournament (four goals, one assist).",
