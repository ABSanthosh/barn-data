The Polish side missed out on a spot in the next stage on goal difference, having finished 25th but level on points with Manchester City, Sporting and Club Brugge above them. AC Milan, meanwhile, were forced to make do with a play-off spot instead of one in the round of 16 after a nightmare away trip that also saw Yunus Musah sent off in the first half. Martin Baturina was on hand to profit from a Matteo Gabbia mistake and get Dinamo ahead on 19 minutes, before Musah was sent off for a second bookable offence in the 39th minute. Despite the man disadvantage, Milan dragged themselves level eight minutes into the second half through Christian Pulisic, who fired an effort into the bottom corner after coming in from the right. Milan’s equaliser came two minutes after Dinamo had a second goal ruled out, with Baturina pulled up for using his arm, while they had another chalked off in the 56th minute for offside. But Dinamo Zagreb finally got themselves back in front on the hour through Marko Pjaca with an angled finish from close range. Milan thought they had a penalty soon after the goal, though it was overturned by the referee following a VAR review, and 2-1 is how the game finished. While Dinamo finished 25th and missed out, AC Milan’s 13th-placed finish means they will face either Juventus or Feyenoord in the play-off. 2 – #Milan have conceded 2+ goals in two away matches in a row in the same edition of the #UEFAChampionsLeague (two against both Real Madrid and Dinamo Zagreb) for the first time since the streak of three in 2011/12. Shaky.#DinamoZagabriaMilan #UCL — OptaPaolo (@OptaPaolo) January 29, 2025 Data debrief: Musah red costs Milan At 22 years and 61 days, Yunus Musah is the youngest player to be sent off for Milan in a Champions League match. Milan have also had more players sent off in the first half of Champions League matches than any other side, with eight of their 12 red cards coming before half time. The defeat for the Italian side, meanwhile, was their first ever against Dinamo Zagreb, having won each of their previous six meetings.",
