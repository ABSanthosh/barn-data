  "text": "Ajax’s Jorrel Hato insisted he feels “at home” in the Dutch capital amid reports of interest from Premier League clubs. Reports have suggested that Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool are all interested in gaining the youngster’s signature this transfer window. Hato made his Eredivisie debut in February 2023, becoming the third-youngest player to debut for Ajax in the competition (16 years, 335 days) behind Ryan Gravenberch and Clarence Seedorf. He has since gone on to make 111 appearances for Ajax in all competitions, scoring three goals and registering nine assists. Hato, who can play centre-back or left-back, has three years left on his current contract, and hinted he would be open to staying at Ajax. “The smartest thing is to look at it per season. That’s what I do,” he told Ajax’s website. “Of course, you want to achieve things in the end: the Champions League, a World Cup and a European Championship. I still have plenty of time. I don’t think I absolutely have to win the Champions League in two years. “In the Dutch league, you have to show how good you are against the big clubs. Ultimately, I have to continue to develop the things I am already good at, so that it becomes top. How do I describe my time at Ajax? Ajax is home for me. I just feel at home here.”",
