Giuliano Simeone and Alexander Sorloth were also on target for Diego Simeone’s side, who moved back within three points of second-place Real Madrid, and seven of LaLiga leaders Barcelona. Valladolid had lost 10 of their 11 previous games, but took a surprise lead in the 21st minute. Mamadou Sylla calmly converted from the penalty spot after Clement Lenglet was penalised for handball following a VAR review. Atletico equalised with a penalty of their own soon after. Alvarez made no mistake after VAR ruled Javi Sanchez had fouled Simeone, who then completed the turnaround in the 27th minute. The visitors were level again on 56 minutes when Sanchez’s free-kick deflected off Conor Gallagher, and wrong-footed Jan Oblak on its way into the net. However, Los Rojiblancos struck twice in the last 20 minutes to get themselves over the line. Alvarez struck again from 12 yards after Henrique fouled Marcos Llorente, while substitute Alexander Sorloth’s close-range finish put the contest beyond Valladolid. 3 – Julián Alvarez is the third Atlético de Madrid player to score two penalty goals in a single game in any competition in the Simeone era, after Diego Costa in 2013 and Saúl Ñíguez in 2020.

Although, it was not easy for the hosts, who scored and conceded a penalty in the first half of a LaLiga for the first time since March 2020 against Sevilla. Alvarez, meanwhile, became the third Atletico player to score two penalties in a single game during the Simeone era, after Diego Costa in 2013 and Saul Niguez in 2020. Sanchez had got Valladolid back on level terms at 2-2, as he became the second defender to score at least two direct free-kicks in a single LaLiga campaign after Florian Lejeune in 2022-23 (also two).",
