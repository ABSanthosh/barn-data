Red Bull Salzburg Starting with Salzburg, while Salzburg might have been frustrated last month as they eventually had to settle for a silver medal finish among Austria’s elite, the Red Bulls are enjoying what has been an extended flurry. Getting their Club World Cup adventure underway with a 2-1 victory against Pachuca in Cincinnati, Thomas Letsch’s side know that they can officially punch their knockout stage ticket late on Sunday night. Signing off their domestic adventure with an action-packed 4-2 win against SK Rapid on May 24th, Salzburg should find the mood in their camp at a red-hot high. Winning all of their previous three appearances across all competitions by an aggregate score of 8-4, Letsch’s men have also impressed with their free-scoring performances in the final third. Red Bull Salzburg Team News All still dealing with respective injury issues, Salzburg will once again be without the likes of Leandro Morgalla, Daouda Guindo, Hendry Blank and Nigerian midfielder Samson Tijani on Sunday night. Following their 2-1 win against Pachuca in midweek, Letsch could be tempted to name an unchanged XI. However, coming off the bench and opening his Club World Cup account on Wednesday, former Mainz striker Karim Onisiwo will be hoping for a full recall. Ex-Brentford starlet Mads Bidstrup will feature in the middle of the park. Al-Hilal As for Al-Hilal, while the Saudi Arabian giants might have opened their respective Club World Cup campaign facing a monumental challenge, Simone Inzaghi got his tenure underway with an impressive display. Eventually snatching a 1-1 stalemate against European icons Real Madrid, the Blues have their sights set on mounting a genuine charge this summer. Although the Riyadh-based outfit might have had to settle for their own domestic silver medal finish last season, they are enjoying their brightest run of 2025. Signing off their regular-season adventure with a 2-0 victory against Al-Qadisiya, Inzaghi’s new side have suffered just a sole defeat from any of their previous 11 appearances across all competitions – a run that stems back to April 4th. Al-Hilal Team News Missing out against Real Madrid earlier in the week with a reported muscle issue, Al-Hilal are once again sweating over the fitness of former Fulham marksman Aleksandar Mitrovic on Sunday night. Opening his Club World Cup account in midweek, ex-Wolves star Ruben Neves will start in the middle of the park. In a squad that is glittering with former Premier League superstars, the likes of Renan Lodi, Kalidou Koulibaly and Portuguese international Joao Cancelo will all feature in Inzaghi’s defence. Red Bull Salzburg vs Al-Hilal Key Factors to Consider Salzburg have won their previous three appearances across all competitions by an aggregate score of 8-4. The Red Bulls have notched at least a pair of goals in all of their last five consecutive outings. Nine of Salzburg’s last 10 appearances have finished with both teams finding the net. Al-Hilal have suffered just a single defeat from any of their previous 11 consecutive appearances across all fronts. Each of Al-Hilal’s last five straight showdowns outside of Riyadh have finished with both teams getting on the scoresheet. Conclusion Snatching what was a famous 1-1 stalemate against Spanish icons Real Madrid in midweek, Al-Hilal will be fancying their chances of making another heavyweight statement. Pencilled in as a standout contender on Sunday night, Inzaghi’s tenure has got off to an eye-catching start. However, despite travelling to Washington enjoying a real flurry, they will meet a Salzburg squad who are 90 minutes away from officially punching a knockout stage ticket. It should be noted, with the Red Bulls seeing nine of their previous 10 appearances finish with both teams finding the net, we are expecting an enjoyable outcome at Audi Field. Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 3/5 Bookmaker: Dachbet",
