  "text": "Vincent Kompany refused to be overly critical of his Bayern Munich team after their 1-1 draw with Union Berlin on Saturday. Leroy Sane’s 75th-minute strike was swiftly cancelled out by a Benedict Hollerbach equaliser at Stadion An der Alten Forsterei. Union had only seven shots to Bayern’s 18, but the visitors only managed to get four of those on target as they accumulated 1.5 expected goals. The draw followed on from a shock defeat to VfL Bochum last week, and second-place Bayer Leverkusen will hope to close the gap on the leaders when they take on Stuttgart on Sunday. But Kompany did not believe his team did too much wrong. “For us, it was a game of two stories, there was the performance and then there’s the result. Of course, at the end, if we don’t have the three points, we’re disappointed with the result. Very simple,” Kompany told reporters. “But I’ve been in football long enough to know that this was not a bad performance away from home. We took away the danger for a very long time. “In the end credit to the opponent because they fought. “Sometimes when you don’t score, it’s not just because the strikers don’t put it in. It’s because the opposing defenders, the keeper, they do a lot of things right. And they did.” Coach Kompany after the draw in Berlin. #FCBayern #MiaSanMia | #FCUFCB pic.twitter.com/SyAjyhsk0J — FC Bayern (@FCBayernEN) March 15, 2025 Bayern had 14 corners in the match but did not make the most of them, with a number of their deliveries being sent into the near post and failing to clear the first man. “That’s been very successful for us this season. We’ve scored a lot of goals from corners as well,” Kompany said. “In these moments where the corners had a little less potency than normal, the last pass, the last cross, nevertheless, we were still dangerous at the end of it. “We were still in a position to win the game. If everything is not perfect, then sometimes you can still win 1-0, but that wasn’t the case today.”",
