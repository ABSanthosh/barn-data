  "text": "Competition: League Two Market: Port Vale win Odds: 1/1 @ BetUS Looking to skyrocket their way into the automatic promotion places, Port Vale will host Barrow on Tuesday night. Starting with the hosts, while Port Vale might have fallen to a 2-1 loss away at Colchester earlier in the month, Darren Moore’s side have proven that downbeat display in Essex was nothing more than a minor blip. Snatching a late 1-0 victory at home against Morecambe over the weekend, the former Sheffield Wednesday boss has seen his squad gain plenty of plaudits. Getting Tuesday’s showdown underway with just their goal difference keeping them outside of the automatic promotion spots, the Valliants are pencilled in as a leading contender to book an immediate League One return in 2025. Making a statement on March 15th as they cruised their way to a 3-0 romp against MK Dons, Moore’s camp have secured consecutive victories over the past week. In fact, Port Vale have suffered just a single defeat from any of their previous 13 consecutive League Two showdowns – a purple patch that stems all the way back to December 29th. As for the visitors, mounting a dramatic late comeback away at AFC Wimbledon over the weekend as they eventually snatched a 2-2 stalemate, Barrow will be looking to spring a real upset here. However, almost sat in League Two limbo, the Bluebirds have struggled to find any real stability this season. Winning just a pair of their previous seven League Two appearances, the Cumbria-based outfit have gained a reputation for their extended issues away from Holker Street. Aside from a 2-1 victory against Notts County earlier in the month, that is the only win that Barrow have recorded on their travels from any of their last 18 outings across all competitions – a rut that stems all the way back to September 14th. It should also be highlighted, Tuesday’s guests have registered just a sole League Two clean sheet on their travels so far this season. Bet: Port Vale 1/1 to beat Barrow in Tuesday’s League Two showdown @ BetUS",
