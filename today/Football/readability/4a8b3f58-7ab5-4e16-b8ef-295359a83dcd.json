  "text": "Competition: Championship Market: Both teams to score Odds: 8/11 @ BetUS In what is a real Championship relegation six-pointer this weekend, Plymouth will welcome Oxford United to Home Park on Saturday afternoon. Starting with the hosts, putting in another nightmare performance last weekend as they slumped to a 4-0 drumming away at Bristol City, the pressure on Wayne Rooney’s shoulders is now at a boiling point. With many suggesting that the former Birmingham boss faces a must-win showdown here, Plymouth find themselves pencilled in as a leading relegation candidate this season. Showing a string of issues this year and coming under plenty of scrutiny, the Pilgrims have also gained a reputation for their glaring defensive struggles. Hit with an infamous 6-1 defeat against Norwich last month, the Devon-based outfit have already shipped 38 Championship goals so far this season. Holding the worst-defensive tally among England’s second-tier, Plymouth have also shipped 10 strikes in their consecutive defeats. Likewise, Rooney’s side have put just a single Championship clean sheet on the board so far this season. It should also be noted, the Greens have seen five of their last six showdowns at Home Park finish with both teams finding the net. As for the visitors, although Oxford United might have secured a Championship return for this season, Des Buckingham’s side have a real battle on their hands in the race to keep hold of their second-tier status. While the Yellows might have snatched a dramatic late 1-1 stalemate at home against Millwall last weekend, that is the only point that Saturday’s guests have put on the board from any of their previous four Championship appearances. Marking their return from November’s international break with a woeful 6-2 defeat at home against Middlesbrough, Oxford have also shown their own issues at the back. Including a 3-0 drumming against Sheffield United last month, the former Mumbai City boss has seen his squad ship 11 goals on their four-match winless rut. Tumbling down the Championship standings and now holding just a three-point buffer over the drop zone, we look set for a real six-pointer from Home Park this weekend.
