  "text": "While it might have been far from a routine performance on Tuesday night, Liverpool extended on their Champions League romp as they clinched a 1-0 victory away at Girona. Although Arne Slot’s men might have had to ride their luck for some spells here, it was attacking talisman Mohamed Salah who dispatched a second-half penalty and dragged Liverpool to their sixth consecutive Champions League victory. The Reds were gifted their match-winning moment as former Manchester United and Everton midfielder Donny van de Beek caught Luis Diaz’s heel in the penalty area. While returning goalkeeper Alisson Becker might have been forced into plenty of action, Liverpool assured of a top-eight finish – sending them straight into the last 16 – if they get a point from their final two fixtures in the league phase. As for Girona, suffering real European frustration here, the Spanish outfit have put just a trio of points on the board from any of their six Champions League appearances and are now seeking a major miracle. On a night when Liverpool extended on their epic European charge, we have taken a look at the main talking points from Tuesday’s showdown. Liverpool are a leading European contender Although many around Anfield might have been heartbroken over the summer as Jurgen Klopp bid farewell, the Reds have embarked on a sensational rise since Slot’s arrival. Handed an additional break as their trip to bitter local rivals Everton was cancelled on Saturday lunchtime due to the adverse weather conditions across England, Liverpool are riding a remarkable wave of momentum. Holding a four-point buffer at the top of the Premier League table and continuing to receive a string of plaudits from across the globe, Tuesday’s guests find the mood in their camp at a red-hot high. With some around Anfield dreaming of the chance to mount a genuine silverware sweep this season, Liverpool have also embarked on a record-breaking European romp. Now winning each of their first six Champions League appearances this season and the only club to boast a 100% record, Slot’s high-flying squad will be next seen in European action when they meet Lille on January 22nd. Salah drags Liverpool over the line At the heart of what has become a real transfer saga at Anfield, Salah has continued to steal plenty of the Premier League’s headlines this season. With news breaking last weekend that Liverpool have officially approached the Egyptian superstar with a new contract extension, it was Salah who dragged Slot’s title contenders over the finishing line here. Converting from the penalty spot and only continuing on another record-breaking charge this season, Salah has now recorded six goals across all competitions since returning from November’s international break. Recording a second Champions League goal of the season here and already leading the chase for England’s Golden Boot after bagging 13 top-flight goals, it is no surprise why the Anfield hierarchy are looking to make strides over a new deal. With it suggested that the 32-year-old’s main priority is to extend his history-making stay in the red half of Merseyside, Salah only further underlined his importance here. Girona’s European struggles continue Springing a famous upset last season as they secured a bronze medal finish among Spain’s elite, Girona certainly underlined their status as one of Europe’s ultimate surprise packages. However, although Michel’s men might have booked a maiden Champions League ticket last year as they broke a string of domestic records, Tuesday’s hosts have drastically struggled to find any real stability this time around. Failing to pick up a much-needed boost last weekend as they fell to a routine 3-0 drumming at home against Real Madrid, Girona are now seeking a major miracle in the race to book a knockout stage ticket. Putting just three points on the board from any of their six Champions League appearances this season, the Catalonia-based outfit have failed have also shown some real issues in the final third. Shockingly crashing out of the Copa del Rey earlier in the month following an infamous penalties defeat against fourth-tier outfit UD Logrones, Girona will have to deal with some mounting pressure.
