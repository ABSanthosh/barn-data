  "text": "Inter coasted into the Champions League quarter-final with a 2-1 win over Feyenoord in the second leg of their last-16 tie at the San Siro on Tuesday, which sealed a 4-1 aggregate win. The Italian side came into this with a 2-0 lead from the away leg and, while the onus was not on them to create opportunities, they appeared to have the tie wrapped up in eight minutes. Marcus Thuram scored a superb solo goal to get Inter ahead on the night, but they were later pegged back by a Jakub Moder penalty three minutes before half-time. Hakan Calhanoglu scored a penalty of his own six minutes into the second half to get the hosts ahead again on the night and, from there, it was comfortable for Inter. Henrikh Mkhitaryan missed a chance from just inside the box on 65 minutes, but Thuram also hit the bar five minutes later. But following those efforts, the match finished without any other major threats from either side. Inter will face Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich in the quarter-final, following their 5-0 victory over compatriots Bayer Leverkusen in their last-16 tie. Data debrief: Inter cruise through Following their victory, Inter have now progressed from each of their last 10 major European knockout ties when winning the first leg. They have also conceded just two goals in the Champions League so far this season. Wednesday’s victory itself, meanwhile, was head coach Simone Inzaghi’s 200th game in charge at Inter.",
