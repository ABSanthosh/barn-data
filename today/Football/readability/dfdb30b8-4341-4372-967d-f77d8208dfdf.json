  "text": "FC Cincinnati have already given head coach Pat Noonan cause for optimism at the start of the new season as attention turns to their MLS opener against the New York Red Bulls. Unlike the Red Bulls, Cincy enter this weekend’s match with competitive action already under their belts. Noonan’s side claimed a big 4-1 first-leg lead away at FC Motagua in the CONCACAF Champions Cup on Wednesday. And although Noonan said Cincy were “nowhere near our best”, the team’s attitude in victory ensured plenty of positives ahead of facing MLS Cup finalists the Red Bulls. “I think the character of the group is very strong,” the coach said. “When you see that behind the scenes and you see how guys deal with difficult situations, that gives me plenty of hope for a high ceiling and expecting even more than what we saw. “So, it’s just one game, it’s just one win, but it, I think, gives you an idea of what’s to come.” There can be no room for complacency now, though, with the new league season looming. Pavel Bucha, who scored twice against Motagua, said: “I’m glad we did it, because always, for every team, it is crucial for you to have a good start to the season. “It brings very positive energy to the team, and we can now be focused on Red Bull on the weekend, and I hope that we will continue like this.” PLAYERS TO WATCH FC Cincinnati – Evander Joining Bucha on the scoresheet in midweek was new signing Evander, who had a goal and an assist in 30 minutes as a substitute. Despite the new surroundings, the creative midfielder carried on where he left off last season, having contributed 15 goals and 18 assists for the Portland Timbers. Only six players in MLS history have had 15 goals and 15 assists in the same season. WHAT AN ACROBATIC FINISH OFF THE VOLLEY FROM EVANDER IN HIS @FCCINCINNATI DEBUT! New team, same Evander. #ChampionsCuppic.twitter.com/SjIlvPXNMl — Major League Soccer (@MLS) February 20, 2025 New York Red Bulls – Emil Forsberg Forsberg was limited to just 15 starts in the 2024 regular season but still contributed nine goals and five assists. Now, starting afresh in 2025, the Red Bulls will hope their talisman can be a regular in the XI and on the scoresheet as they look to go one better than last year. MATCH PREDICTION: CINCINNATI WIN This fixture has not gone according to form of late. The Red Bulls have won their past three meetings with Cincinnati, who have been one of the best teams in the league over this period. New York are the only team with three wins over Cincy across the past two regular seasons. Cincy have tallied the second-most points in MLS across the past three seasons, while the Red Bulls, despite their playoff success, entered the 2024 postseason with just three wins in their previous 20 matches in all competitions. Unless the Red Bulls can improbably recreate the magic of their playoff run, Cincy will be firm favourites. OPTA WIN PROBABILITY FC Cincinnati – 44.5% Draw – 26.9% New York Red Bulls – 28.6%",
