As Spanish icons Real Madrid seeking an immediate European response, we have nine Champions League showdowns on the cards throughout Tuesday night. For those of you looking to stick on a midweek flutter, we have taken a glance at two of the most appealing European betting markets. 20:00 Real Madrid vs Borussia Dortmund Getting their hands on an historic 15th European crown back on June 1st as they secured a 2-0 win against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley, Real Madrid will certainly be calling on a repeat performance here. Although Los Blancos might have opened October with a shock 1-0 loss away at French outfit Lille, Carlo Ancelotti’s superstar squad are once again pencilled in as a standout contender to defend their European crown this year. Picking up some crucial momentum over the weekend as they secured a 2-1 win away at Celta Vigo, Tuesday’s hosts have suffered just a single defeat across any competition since opening up the new campaign. However, despite looking to lay down a Champions League marker here, Real Madrid know the importance of finding some much-welcomed defensive stability. In fact, the reigning European champions have managed to muster just a sole clean sheet from any of their previous seven showdowns across all fronts. Although Borussia Dortmund might have struggled to find much domestic stability since opening up the new campaign, Nuri Sahin’s men have come flying out of the traps since getting their Champions League adventure underway. Clearly showing no signs of a hangover following on from their heartbreak at Wembley on June 1st, the one-time Real Madrid midfielder has seen his squad win each of their first two group stage showdowns by an aggregate score of 10-1. Storming their way to a sensational 7-1 romp against Scottish heavyweights Celtic prior to October’s international break, BVB will be excited by their clinical performances in the final third. However, facing what will certainly be another real examination on Tuesday night, Dortmund have shown some extended issues outside of rural Germany. Including an infamous 5-1 drumming at the hands of Stuttgart on September 22nd, the German giants have conceded seven goals in their last two battles away from Signal Iduna Park. Real Madrid vs Borussia Dortmund Betting Tip: Real Madrid win \u0026 Both teams to score @ 13/8 with Pribet 20:00 Juventus vs Stuttgart Getting a new era underway over the summer following the arrival of Thiago Motta, Juventus have only continued on a real rise under the former Bologna boss. Marking their return from October’s international break over the weekend with a dominant display as they secured a 1-0 victory at home against Lazio, Tuesday’s hosts have rightfully received plenty of plaudits from across the continent. Flying out of the traps since opening up their Champions League adventure and last seen in European action securing a dramatic 3-2 win away at RB Leipzig, the Old Lady will be confident of extending on their 100% start here. With the mood around Turin at at a red-hot high and with their sights set on mounting a genuine Serie A title charge this season, Juventus are yet to suffer a single defeat across any competition since opening up the new campaign and some have even installed them as a potential European dark horse. While Stuttgart might have cemented their spot as one of Europe’s ultimate surprise packages last season after securing a Bundesliga silver medal finish, Die Roten have drastically struggled to find any kind of stability this time around. Marking their return from October’s international break with a nightmare performance away at Bayern Munich as they suffered a 4-0 drumming, Sebastian Hoeneb’s men are without a win from any of their previous four appearances across all competitions. Getting their Champions League adventure underway with a 3-1 loss away at defending champions Real Madrid, Tuesday’s guests have failed to collect consecutive victories since opening up the new campaign. Likewise, showing some extended defensive issues and yet to record a single clean sheet so far this season, Stuttgart should have another tough examination on their hands when they travel to Turin in midweek. Juventus vs Stuttgart Betting Tip: Juventus win \u0026 Under 4.5 goals @ 27/20 with Luckster Tuesday’s Champions League Double Real Madrid vs Borussia Dortmund – Real Madrid win \u0026 Both teams to score @ 13/8 Juventus vs Stuttgart – Juventus win \u0026 Under 4.5 goals @ 27/20 Place a £10 bet on our Daily Double with Vegas Land and pocket £61.69 if all predictions are correct.
