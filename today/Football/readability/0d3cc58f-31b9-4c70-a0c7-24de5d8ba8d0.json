(@CPFC) June 30, 2025 John Textor owned shares in both Palace and Lyon, though the French giants were relegated to Ligue 2 due to financial discrepancies. Lyon, though, won their appeal against that decision, and as they qualified for the Europa League via league placing, they will remain in UEFA’s secondary club tournament. As such, it is Palace who have been demoted, though the club are expected to appeal the decision. Textor has since sold his stake to New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, and has resigned from his leadership positions at Lyon.",
