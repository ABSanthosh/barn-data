  "text": "Verdict: Wales win to nil Best Odds: 8/11 Bookmaker: Dachbet Getting their World Cup qualifying adventure underway on Saturday night, Wales will welcome Kazakhstan to Cardiff. Wales Starting with the hosts, while Wales might have only appointed Craig Bellamy last summer, the Dragons are clearly enjoying life under the former Burnley coach. Embarking on what was a major Nations League romp last year as they were unbeaten in all of their six League B showdowns, the mood around Cardiff appears to be at a red-hot high. Signing off 2024 with a 4-1 victory against Iceland, it appears that Wales have turned a real corner since their EURO 24 qualifying heartbreak 12 months ago. Securing another 4-1 win against Finland in March 2024, Bellamy’s side will also be excited by their extended success on home soil. In fact, Saturday’s hosts have not lost any of their previous nine showdowns at the Cardiff Cardiff City Stadium within 90 minutes – a run that stems all the way back to the summer of 2023. Wales Team News Crowned as the Championship’s Player of the Month for February, Leeds star Daniel James will play a leading role on Saturday night. However, all dealing with respective injury issues, the trio of Ethan Ampadu, Wes Burns and Fulham ace Harry Wilson will not feature this month. Likewise, in what was a real blow for Bellamy’s squad, skipper Aaron Ramsey has been forced to withdraw from Wales’ squad after picking up an injury. While Danny Ward might have made just a pair of Premier League appearances for Leicester City this season, the 31-year-old should keep his spot between the sticks. Kazakhstan As for the visitors, enduring what was a public Nations League nightmare last year as they lost their League B status with a whimper, Kazakhstan find themselves at the heart of a public crisis. Signing off 2024 with what was a routine 5-0 drumming at the hands of Norway, the Hawks collected just a single point from any of their six Nations League appearances. Losing all of their final five showdowns by an aggregate score of 15-0, it is no surprise that Ali Aliyev’s side are pencilled in as a landslide underdog when they travel to Cardiff this weekend. Opening the New Year with a 2-0 loss against North Korea in a friendly matchup, Kazakhstan have shown a string of issues at both ends of the pitch. Kazakhstan Team News Completing a move to Premier League giants Chelsea last month, 16-year-old sensation Dastan Satpaev has been included in Kazakhstan squad. However, not featuring since the end of January and still dealing with an injury issue, Besiktas midfielder Bakhtiyar Zaynutdinov will miss out. Despite notching just a single strike for Turkish outfit Adanademirspor since opening the New Year, Abat Aymbetov will spearhead the Hawks’ charge. Playing his domestic football with Russian giants Zenit Saint Petersburg, Nuraly Alip will start at the heart of Kazakhstan’s defence. Wales vs Kazakhstan Key Factors to Consider Saturday’s showdown in Cardiff will be the first competitive meeting between Wales and Kazakhstan. Wales have not lost any of their previous nine consecutive home fixtures across all competitions within 90 minutes. Kazakhstan lost all of their six Nations League appearances last year by an aggregate score of 15-0. The Dragons have recorded a clean sheet in three of their previous four appearances in Cardiff. Kazakhstan have failed to notch a single competitive goal on foreign soil since November 2023. Conclusion With the mood around Cardiff appearing to be at a red-hot high, Wales will be looking to open their World Cup qualifying campaign with an early statement of intent. Clearly enjoying life since Bellamy’s appointment last summer, the Dragons are rightfully pencilled in as a landslide favourite this weekend. Meeting a Kazakhstan squad that remarkably lost all of their final five Nations League showdowns last year by an aggregate score of 15-0, Saturday’s guests couldn’t have asked for a tougher challenge here. Verdict: Wales win to nil  Best Odds: 8/11 Bookmaker: Dachbet",
