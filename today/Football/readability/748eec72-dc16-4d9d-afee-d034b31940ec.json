The Ukraine international was provisionally suspended by the Blues last week, having returned a positive “A” sample when undergoing a routine drugs test in October. Reports from ESPN suggested the prohibited substance found was meldonium, which was administered to Mudryk while he was outside the United Kingdom. Mudryk responded to the positive test by declaring he was “shocked” in an Instagram post, insisting he “has never knowingly used any banned substances.” The 23-year-old could face a lengthy ban if found guilty, and Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca says he will take some time away during the investigation. “In this moment it’s also good he can disconnect a little bit from the situation,” Maresca said in his pre-match press conference ahead of Chelsea’s Boxing Day meeting with Fulham. “The last time I spoke with him, we tried to support him but in this moment we are waiting.”",
