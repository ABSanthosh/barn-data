  "text": "Verdict: Raphinha over 0.5 shots on target  Best Odds: 4/9 Bookmaker: Luckster Getting their Champions League Round of 16 underway on Wednesday night, Barcelona will return to Lisbon when they meet Benfica. Benfica As for the visitors, extending on their Champions League adventure a fortnight ago as they clung to a nail-biting 4-3 aggregate win against Monaco, Benfica have real found top gear over the past six weeks. With just their goal difference keeping them off the top of the Primeira Liga standings, Bruno Lage’s men find the mood in their camp at a red-hot high. Punching their Taco de Portugal semi-final ticket last time out as they claimed a 1-0 victory against Braga, the Eagles have won seven of their previous eight appearances across all competitions. However, although the former Wolves boss might be desperate to collect what would be a famous Champions League scalp this month, they should be concerned by their infamous last meeting against Wednesday’s guests. Slumping to a remarkable 5-4 loss when they welcomed Barca to Lisbon for a group stage battle on January 21st, Lage’s side will be bracing themselves for another stern examination here. Benfica Team News Still dealing with a recent hamstring injury, Benfica are once again expected to be without former Real Madrid superstar Angel Di Maria on Wednesday night. Not featuring since January 11th, the Eagles will also be unable to call upon former Bayern Munich midfielder Renato Sanches in midweek. Notching a famous Champions League hat-trick against Barcelona back in January and recording 11 goals in his previous 10 appearances across all competitions, the red-hot Vangelis Pavlidis will play a leading role in the final third. Former Manchester City defender Nicolas Otamendi will partner Antonio Silva at the back. Barcelona As for the visitors, putting in what was another dominant display over the weekend as they cruised their way to a 4-0 romp at home against Real Sociedad, Barcelona are enjoying a real purple patch. Skyrocketing themselves back to the top of the La Liga table, the Spanish giants are clearly enjoying life under Hansi Flick. Although some around Catalonia might have been shocked last summer following the appointment of the former Bayern Munich boss, Barca have continued to receive a string of plaudits from across the continent. Storming their way to a Champions League top-eight finish, Wednesday’s guests are unbeaten in all of their previous 13 appearances across all competitions. Crowned Super Cup champions on January 12th as they secured a famous 5-2 victory against arch-rivals Real Madrid, Flick’s side have also found a major clinical edge in the final third. Barcelona Team News Suffering yet another injury setback last week, Barcelona have confirmed that former Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen will not feature here. Likewise, German goalkeeper Marc-Andre her Stegen is not expected to feature over the remainder of the season due to a long-term knee issue. Once again finding the net against Sociedad on Sunday and enjoying what has been another record-breaking flurry this season, Polish icon Robert Lewandowski will spearhead Flick’s charge. Bagging that dramatic last-gasp winning in Lisbon on January 21st, ex-Leeds talisman Raphinha will join Lewandowski in attack. Key Factors to Consider When Benfica and Barcelona met for a Champions League group stage showdown on January 21st, Flick’s side secured a sensational 5-4 victory in Lisbon. Barcelona are unbeaten in all of their previous 13 appearances across all competitions. Benfica have won seven of their last eight appearances across all formats. Barca have won each of their previous four showdowns outside of Catalonia by an aggregate score of 16-5. Eight of Benfica’s last nine appearances at the Estadio da Luz has finished with over 2.5 goals. Conclusion Mounting what was a sensational last-gasp comeback in Lisbon on January 21st as Barcelona clinched a famous 5-4 win, neutrals will be hoping for a similar Champions League thriller. With Flick’s side skyrocketing their way back to the top of the La Liga table on Sunday as they stormed their way to a 4-0 romp against Real Sociedad, the Spanish heavyweights are enjoying what has become quite the flurry. Likewise, winning all of their last four showdowns outside of Catalonia by an aggregate score of 16-5, we could be treated to another action-packed contest on Wednesday night.
