  "text": "Verdict: Goal to be scored in both halves Best Odds: 3/5 Bookmaker: Luckster In what will be a heavyweight Champions League showdown on Wednesday night, Liverpool will welcome Real Madrid to Anfield. Liverpool Starting with the hosts, while many around Anfield might have been heartbroken following Jurgen Klopp’s departure from Anfield over the summer, Liverpool have embarked on a sensational rise since Arne Slot’s arrival. Mounting a second-half comeback away at Southampton on Sunday afternoon as they eventually left St. Mary’s with an action-packed 3-2 victory, the Reds have continued to receive a string of plaudits from across the globe. Remarkably holding an eight-point buffer at the top of the Premier League table, the former Feyenoord boss has seen his squad suffer just a single defeat from any of their first 18 appearances across all competitions. Last seen in European action storming their way to a 4-0 romp against German giants Bayer Leverkusen, Liverpool should be relishing a return to Anfield in midweek. Team News Once again missing out away at Southampton over the weekend, Liverpool are once again expected to be without Brazilian goalkeeper Alisson Becker on Wednesday night. Likewise, struggling to find any real stability since arriving at Anfield over the summer, ex-Juventus star Federico Chiesa remains on the sidelines. Bagging a Premier League brace at St. Mary’s over the weekend and now registering 10 goals in his last 13 appearances for club and country, attacking talisman Mohamed Salah will lead Slot’s charge. 21-year-old Conor Bradley should keep his spot at right-back with England international Trent Alexander-Arnold still dealing with a thigh issue. Real Madrid As for the visitors, while Real Madrid might have found themselves at the heart of a real struggle when opening November, Los Blancos have found some recent stability. Marking their return from the fortnight interval with a routine 3-0 victory away at Leganes, Carlo Ancelotti’s men will now know the importance of claiming an essential European boost. Last seen in Champions League action falling to a 3-1 loss at home against AC Milan, the defending champions have put just six points on the board from their first four appearances. Despite facing what will be a real challenge when they travel to Anfield on Wednesday night, Madrid will be excited by a stellar record against Wednesday’s hosts. Along with landing a 6-2 aggregate victory when they last met Liverpool back in March 2023, Ancelotti’s side are unbeaten in each of their previous eight meetings across all fronts. Team News All still dealing with respective long-term knee injuries, Real Madrid will once again be without the trio of Dani Carvajal, David Alaba and former Porto defender Eder Militao. Likewise, missing out away at Leganes over the weekend, Los Blancos will once again be without Brazilian international Rodrygo. Recording just a second La Liga strike since the end of September on Sunday evening, French icon Kylian Mbappe will spearhead Ancelotti’s attack at Anfield. Making a speedy return from a muscle injury last weekend, ex-Chelsea goaleekerp Thibaut Courtois will start between the sticks here. Key Factors to Consider When Liverpool and Real Madrid last met in Champions League action in March 2023, Los Blancos collected a 6-2 aggregate win. Real Madrid are unbeaten in all of their previous eight meetings against Wednesday’s hosts. Liverpool have lost just one of their first 18 appearances across all competitions so far this season. Los Blancos have recorded just a pair of clean sheets outside of the Spanish capital so far this season. Mohamed Salah has recorded 10 goals in his previous 13 appearances for club and country. Conclusion In what promises to be an all-star Champions League showdown on Wednesday night, neutrals will be hoping for fireworks from Anfield. With the Premier League giants embarking on a sensational rise since Slot’s arrival over the summer, they should be confident of collecting a heavyweight European scalp here. Gaining a reputation for their free-scoring performances in the final third, the Reds will be looking to claim a first competitive victory against the defending champions since March 2009. With Los Blancos recording just a pair of clean sheets on their travels so far this season, we could be treated to a pulsating affair in midweek.
