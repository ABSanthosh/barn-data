After being frustrated for large parts of the encounter, Hurtig bundled home from close range after Martina Lenzini’s poor clearance to book the Gunners’ place in the last eight. Despite Arsenal dominating the early exchanges, it was Juventus who had the first sight of goal, though Eva Schatzer’s effort was easy for Daphne van Domselaar to gather. In a first half that saw just two shots on target, both coming from the visitors, Renee Slegers’ substitutes proved to be the difference for Arsenal. Slegers introduced Beth Mead, Stina Blackstenius and Hurtig late on, with the latter somehow putting Kim Little’s cross over the bar from five yards out. However, the Swede would atone for her earlier error, combining with fellow substitute Blackstenius to net against her former club and send them out of the competition with two group games remaining.

The reigning champions are still three points behind Manchester City following their 2-1 win over Hammarby, and know a win against the Swedes next month will see them progress. Kika Nazareth opened the scoring in the 20th minute after capitalising on a mistake by Kamila Dubcova, notching her second nine minutes later from close range. Barca found themselves three goals up at the break when Vicky Lopez netted her first goal in the competition to put the result beyond doubt. There was also a landmark moment for Alexia Putellas, who netted her 200th goal for the club with a well-taken effort into the far corner. Valentina Madl took some of the shine off an otherwise impressive display from the visitors, who have now taken their tally to 20 goals from their four matches in the competition.",
