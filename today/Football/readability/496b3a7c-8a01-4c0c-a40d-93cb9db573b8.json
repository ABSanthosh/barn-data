  "text": "With all eyes falling on Stamford Bridge, Chelsea and Arsenal played out a 1-1 draw in west London on Sunday afternoon. While former Chelsea star Kai Havertz might have seen his first-half strike correctly ruled out by VAR, chances came at a premium in SW6. With the Gunners desperate to make up some crucial ground in the title chase, Mikel Arteta’s squad eventually opened the scoring on the hour mark as Brazil international Gabriel Martinelli found a way past Robert Sanchez’s near post. However, enduring what has become quite the struggle since returning from October’s international break, Arsenal were almost immediately pegged back as Pedro Neto produced a thunderous strike just 10 minutes after Martinelli’s opener. While Arsenal might have still not suffered a single Premier League defeat in west London since back in 2018, they already find themselves sat nine points adrift of leaders Liverpool. As for Chelsea, suffering just a single defeat from any of their previous 10 straight Premier League appearances, Sunday’s 1-1 stalemate at Stamford Bride was enough to push the Blues back into the Champions League spots. In what was a largely cagey affair from SW6 on Sunday afternoon, we have taken a look at the main talking points. Arsenal fail to claim a crucial boost While Arsenal might have come flying out of the traps when opening up the new campaign, Arteta’s squad have continued to show some real issues since returning from October’s fortnight interval. Suffering a maiden Champions League defeat earlier in the week as they fell to a 1-0 loss away at Italian giants Inter Milan, the Gunners have seen their title ambitions take a major dent. Marking their return from October’s international break with a shock 2-0 defeat at the hands of Bournemouth last month, Sunday’s guests have remarkably won just a pair of their previous seven appearances across all competitions. Likewise, including a 1-0 loss against Newcastle last weekend, they have failed to collect consecutive victories across any format over the past six weeks. Notching just a single strike in their three appearances over the past week and entering November’s break sat nine points adrift in this season’s title hunt, Arteta’s side must dust themselves down quickly over the next fortnight. Chelsea continue to impress Although on paper Chelsea might have registered just a single victory from any of their previous four appearances across all fronts, the Blues have continued to gain a string of plaudits. While some around SW6 might have been left surprised over the summer as Enzo Marsesca was appointed as Mauricio Pochettino’s replacement, Sunday’s hosts are certainly enjoying life under the former Leicester manager. Now suffering just a single defeat from any of their previous 10 consecutive Premier League appearances, it is no secret that Chelsea have their sights firmly set on booking a lucrative Champions League return this season. Storming their way to an 8-0 romp against Noah earlier in the week and now winning each of their first three Conference League showdowns by an aggregate score of 16-3, the Blues should find the mood in their camp at a real high. Heading into the fortnight break sat in bronze medal position, Maresca’s side will be next seen on November 23rd when the Italian tactician returns to the King Power. The Gunners need stability away from the Emirates Although Arsenal might have gained a real reputation for their success on the road last season as they collected 25 points from their final nine Premier League showdowns away from the Emirates, Arteta’s side have drastically struggled to find a similar level this time around. Suffering Champions League frustration earlier in the week as they fell to that 1-0 loss at the hands of Inter Milan, Sunday’s guests are desperately seeking some much-needed stability outside of north London. Once again dropping a pair of crucial points in SW6, Arsenal’s 3-0 EFL Cup victory away at Preston on October 30th is the only way win that they have recorded from any of their previous seven appearances away from the Emirates. With that extended rut stemming all the way back to a 1-0 victory against arch-rivals Tottenham on September 15th, Arteta will know that his squad must find a way to end their away day struggles if they are to mount a genuine title charge this season.
