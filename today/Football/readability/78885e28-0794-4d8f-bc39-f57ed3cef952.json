  "text": "Hansi Flick saluted a “very important” response by Barcelona after they put their recent struggles behind them with victory over Athletic Bilbao in the Supercopa de Espana semi-finals. The Blaugrana had topped the LaLiga table following a brilliant start to the season. However, a run of just one win in seven league games – including back-to-back defeats against Leganes and Atletico Madrid – saw them surrender top spot. Nevertheless, they have responded well after the mid-season break, putting six goals past Barbastro and Bilbao without reply, beating the latter 2-0 in Jeddah on Wednesday. “I think we deserved it. At times, we didn’t dominate as usual, but I’m happy,” he told reporters. “The objective was to reach the final, and we are happy to have kept a clean sheet. “We are a young team, and we have to learn a lot. The style, the way we play, is what’s important. “We lost against Atletico [2-1], and it wasn’t pretty. But we played a great game and, after the break, we beat Barbastro and Athletic with clean sheets, and that’s very important.” Gavi and Lamine Yamal were on target for Flick’s side, the latter marking his return from injury with a fine strike in the second half. “It’s true that we suffered, especially at the end of the first half, but we knew how to play very well and very happy,” Yamal said. “As long as the coach gives me the option, I’m happy to be able to help the team.” “I was lucky enough to score the goal and give the assist [for Yamal’s goal],” Gavi added. “But in the end, what matters is that we are in the final, and we have to win it.” Partido muy serio, equipo.
