Atleti are fifth in the standings ahead of their final match away to RB Salzburg, who cannot qualify for the next stage of the tournament after six defeats from seven, and know a win will get them straight through to the round of 16. Simeone’s side lost top spot in LaLiga to Real Madrid at the weekend following a 1-1 draw against Villarreal, but he was confident that nothing would distract his team on European duty. “We are not thinking about anything other than tomorrow’s game, we want to do it in the best possible way. We will be up against a young, dynamic team,” Simeone told a press conference. “They will want to finish the Champions League well. The game is very important and we want to take it to them where it will hurt them. “When this new tournament started we were hopeful of being among the top eight. It is difficult and will be difficult. There will be difficulties that we will encounter.” 16 – Atletico de Madrid have taken 16 points from losing positions in LaLiga 2024/25, the most of any team in Europe’s top five leagues this season. Timely. pic.twitter.com/MssJ2tzZb9 — OptaJose (@OptaJose) January 25, 2025 Simeone has previously spoken about the challenges that come with the new Champions League format, with only the top eight bypassing the play-off round – ninth to 24th will face each other in a two-legged knockout rounds beforehand. But he acknowledged that he thought the big teams would still find a way through despite any hardships. “I’m not looking too much at everything to do with who can qualify and who can’t,” Simeone said. “The big teams always end up getting out of difficult situations and I have no doubt that they will end up fighting to win the Champions League.”",
