  "text": "While Spanish giants Real Madrid might steal plenty of Friday’s headlines as they look to officially punch their Club World Cup knockout stage ticket, we have a full set of Irish fixtures on the cards this weekend. As Premier Division giants Shamrock Rovers seek an immediate response, the race for a lucrative European ticket is really starting to heat up. With five Premier Division matchups set for Friday night, we have taken a look at some of the most attractive betting markets that are available. 19:45 Bohemians vs Sligo Rovers While Bohemians might have spent the whole of last season scrapping it out at the foot of the Premier Division table, Alan Reynolds’ men have come roaring back in a sensational fashion. Already underlining their status as Ireland’s ultimate surprise package since opening up the 2025 campaign, Friday’s hosts find themselves sat in silver medal position and in pole position to book an iconic European ticket. Last seen collecting what was a heavyweight scalp as they claimed a 2-0 victory against runaway leaders Shamrock, the Bohs are in the midst of a record-breaking run. Getting June underway with another 2-0 win against Cork City, Reynolds’ side have mustered nine points from their last four Premier Division appearances. Likewise, along with winning all of their previous three consecutive showdowns at Dalymount Park by an aggregate score of 4-0, they have also won six of their last seven showdowns in front of their own supporters. Managing to claim what was an essential boost last weekend as they snatched a 2-1 victory at home against Galway, Sligo will be desperate to use that performance as a platform to build on. However, opening Friday’s trip to Dalymount Park sat firmly in the relegation zone, they are also nine points adrift of Premier Division safety. Signing off May with a 1-0 loss at the hands of St. Patrick’s the Rovers will be bracing themselves for what is a stern examination here. Likewise, last seen on their travels getting hit with a 1-0 defeat against Drogheda, John Russell’s men have continued to show a string of glaring issues on the road. Including an action-packed 3-2 loss against defending champions Shelbourne last month, Sligo have lost four of their previous five matchups away from the Showgrounds. It should also be noted, Friday’s guests also slumped to a frantic 4-2 defeat when they travelled to Dalymount Park back on April 4th. Bohemians vs Sligo Rovers Betting Tip: Dayle Rooney to score anytime @ 23/10 with Pribet 20:00 Shamrock Rovers vs Waterford Eventually falling to that 2-0 loss away at local rivals Bohemians last weekend, Shamrock will be seeking an immediate response here. Nevertheless, despite being left hugely frustrated last season as they had to settle for a silver medal finish, Stephen Bradley’s men are cruising their way to a 22nd domestic crown this time around. Getting Friday’s showdown underway holding a commanding nine-point buffer over the chasing pack, the former Ireland boss has seen his squad lose just one of their previous 12 appearances – a run that stems all the way back to April 21st. Last seen at the Tallaght Stadium claiming a thumping 4-1 victory against Cork City, Friday’s hosts will also be excited to make a return to home soil this weekend. Including a 4-0 romp against St. Patrick’s on May 19th, Shamrock have registered 13 points from their last five appearances in front of their own supporters. While Waterford might have opened May in the midst of what was a real purple patch, the Blues have come crashing back down to earth over the past six weeks. Eventually forced to settle for a 2-2 stalemate at home against Shelbourne last weekend, John Coleman’s men have mustered just a sole victory from any of their previous six Premier Division appearances. Once again looking over their shoulder at a potential relegation scrap, Friday’s guests should also be concerned by a nightmare record against the runway Irish leaders. Falling to a routine 3-1 loss when they welcomed Shamrock to town on May 16th, they have lost all of their previous four meetings by an aggregate score of 9-3. Getting June underway with a toothless 1-0 defeat away at fellow strugglers Sligo Rovers, Coleman’s camp are pencilled in as a landslide underdog when they make the trip to Dublin this weekend. Shamrock Rovers vs Waterford Betting Tip: Graham Burke to score anytime @ 13/8 with Luckster Friday’s Irish Premier Division Double Bohemians vs Sligo Rovers – Dayle Rooney to score anytime @ 23/10 Shamrock Rovers vs Waterford – Graham Burke to score anytime @ 13/8 Place a £10 bet on our Daily Double with Vegas Land and pocket £86.83 if all predictions are correct.
