  "text": "Fabian Hurzeler stressed Brighton have not achieved anything yet, after they twice came from behind to beat Liverpool 3-2 and strengthen their grip on eighth place. The Seagulls claimed a huge victory over the Premier League champions at the Amex Stadium, with Yasin Ayari and Kaoru Mitoma cancelling out strikes from Harvey Elliott and Dominik Szoboszlai, before Jack Hinshelwood came on to score the winner. Eighth could still be enough to secure Europa Conference League qualification, and the win takes Brighton three points clear of ninth-placed Brentford with one game to play. Bournemouth – five points back of the Seagulls – have two matches remaining, but Brighton now know a win at Tottenham on Sunday would secure eighth. Speaking to BBC Sport after the game, Hurzeler urged his players not to get carried away, saying: “There have been a lot of highs and lows throughout the season. “It’s important you don’t overreact, you have to stay grounded and humble because there is still one game to go, but I’m really proud of the team. “It’s not only about playing a football game and the tactical side, it’s about the mental side too. “We can only be successful if we stick together and we proved that today, so we are very happy, but there is one game to go. “The players changed the intensity on the pitch. They used the goal as a wake-up signal. Liverpool were impressive in the first 20 minutes, but I was happy with the reaction.” Only Fulham (17) have had more goals scored by substitutes in the Premier League this season than Brighton (13), with Mitoma and Hinshelwood both netting off the bench on Monday. Hinshelwood tapped Matt O’Riley’s cross home just 88 seconds after entering the fray, scoring the fourth-fastest goal by a Premier League substitute in 2024-25. And Hinshelwood’s outing was made even more memorable by the fact he came on alongside his cousin Harry Howell, who – at the age of 17 years and 29 days – became Brighton’s youngest ever Premier League player. “It was a really nice moment coming on with my cousin. We’ve been working so hard since we were kids,” Hinshelwood told Sky Sports. “We’ve been playing together since we were just born, kicking balls with each other, so to come on together, and he made a great run across the front post to open the gap for me… I’ll be thanking him later!”",
