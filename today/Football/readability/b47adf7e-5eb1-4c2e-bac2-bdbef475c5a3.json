  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 10/11 Bookmaker: Luckster Seeking a much-welcomed boost on Sunday afternoon, Atletico Madrid will travel to Andalusia when they meet Sevilla. Sevilla Starting with the hosts, once again drastically failing to find any kind of stability this season, Sevilla once again find themselves scrapping it out in the bottom-half of the La Liga standings. Marking their return from March’s international break with a 2-1 loss away at Real Betis, Xavier Pimienta’s men have won just a trio of their previous 13 appearances across all competitions. Watching their Copa del Rey adventure come to an end on January 4th as they opened the New Year with a 4-1 drumming at the hands of Almeria, the former Sevilla boss finds some real pressure on his shoulders. Facing what should be another stern examination here, Sevilla have also gained a reputation for their glaring issues on home soil. Including a 4-1 defeat against Barcelona on February 9th, Pimienta’s side have failed to win any of their first five showdowns in Andalusia so far this calendar year. Sevilla Team News Not making a single appearance since the end of October, Sevilla will once again be without former Bayern Munich defender Tanguy Nianzou on Sunday afternoon. However, after both serving respective suspensions against Real Betis last weekend, the duo of Djibril Sow and Lucien Agoume will return to Pimienta’s squad. Arriving from Atletico Madrid on a season-long loan switch last summer, Saul Niguez could feature against his parent club. Once again attracting plenty of Premier League interest, Loic Bade will partner Kike Salas at the back. Atletico Madrid As for the visitors, while Atletico Madrid might have opened the New Year at the heart of a La Liga title scrap, Diego Simeone’s men have come crashing back down to earth in a worrying fashion. Watching their Copa del Rey adventure come to an end earlier in the week as they fell to a 5-4 aggregate defeat against Barcelona, Sunday’s guests are desperately seeking a much-welcomed boost here. However, marking their return from March’s international break with a 1-1 stalemate against Espanyol, Atletico have failed to win any of their previous six appearances across all competitions. With their recent issues underlined by a 2-1 defeat against Getafe on March 9th, Simeone’s side have also shown some extended issues on the road. In fact, the Spanish giants have mustered just a sole win from any of their previous six showdowns away from the Metropolitano. Atletico Madrid Team News After serving a three-match domestic suspension, Argentinian international Angel Correa will return to Atletico Madrid’s squad on Sunday afternoon. Ahead of their trip to Andalusia this weekend, Simeone’s camp have reported a clean bill of health and have no fresh injury concerns to worry about. Handed a full Copa del Rey rest against Barcelona earlier in the week, number one shot-stopper Jan Oblak will return between the sticks here. Making a real impact after completing a permanent switch from Manchester City last summer and registering 23 goals across all competitions, Julian Alvarez will lead Atletico’s charge in the final third. Sevilla vs Atletico Madrid Key Factors to Consider When Sevilla and Atletico Madrid met for their reverse La Liga meeting on December 8th, Sunday’s guests collected an action-packed 4-3 win in the capital. However, Atletico have failed to win any of their previous six appearances across all competitions. Sevilla have won just a trio of their previous 13 matchups across all competitions. Four of Sevilla’s last five showdowns in Andalusia have finished with both teams finding the net. Six of Atletico’s previous seven matchups away from the Metropolitano have seen both teams get on the scoresheet. Conclusion With Sevilla and Atletico playing out a seven-goal thriller when they met for their reverse La Liga meeting on December 8th, neutrals will be hoping for another thriller this weekend. With Sunday’s hosts seeing four of their previous five showdowns in Andalusia finish with both teams finding the net, Simeone’s men have also gained a reputation for their lively outcomes outside of the capital. With six of Atletico’s last seven contests away from the Metropolitano finish with both teams getting on the scoresheet, we are expecting a similar outcome.
