  "text": "Verdict: Bayern Munich win \u0026 Both teams to score Best Odds: 13/8 Bookmaker: Dachbet In what is a heavyweight Bundesliga showdown on Saturday evening, Bayern Munich will welcome Borussia Dortmund to the Allianz. Bayern Munich Starting with the hosts, getting the Champions League quarter-final adventure underway with a 2-1 loss at home against Inter Milan earlier in the week, Bayern Munich will be seeking an immediate response here. Nevertheless, despite watching their European dreams take a blow on Tuesday night, Vincent Kompany’s men are enjoying a major domestic romp. Getting this weekend’s fixtures underway holding a six-point buffer over defending champions Bayer Leverkusen, the former Burnley boss will be calling on his squad to lay down another marker here. Marking their return from March’s international break with consecutive victories against St. Pauli and Augsburg, Bayern should also be excited by their domestic success on home soil. In fact, Saturday’s hosts have won 11 of their previous 12 Bundesliga showdowns at the Allianz – a run that stems back to a 1-1 stalemate against Leverkusen on September 28th. Bayern Munich Team News Picking up what was a long-term knee injury while away with Canada during March’s international break, Alphonso Davies is set to miss the remainder of the season. Likewise, dealing with what has become a stacked injury list, Kompany’s side will also be without the likes of Dayot Upamecano, Jamal Musiala and number one goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Storming his way to Germany’s Golden Boot this season and already notching 23 Bundesliga strikes, England skipper Harry Kane will lead the line here. Former Tottenham defender Eric Dier could keep his spot alongside Min-Jae Kim at the heart of Kompany’s defence. Borussia Dortmund As for the visitors, putting in what was a nightmare European display earlier in the week as they slumped to a 4-0 drumming at the hands of Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund have watched their Champions League dreams go up in smoke. Opening this weekend’s fixtures sat way down in eighth and holding just a two-point buffer from dropping out the top-half, Niko Kovac’s side have rightfully come under a huge amount of scrutiny this season. Despite claiming a thumping 4-1 win away at Freiburg last weekend, BVB have struggled to find any kind of stability on the road. In fact, Kovac’s camp have failed to register consecutive Bundesliga wins outside of rural Germany over the past 12 months. Likewise, mustering just a single Bundesliga victory at the Allianz since way back in 2017, Dortmund will know that they can’t afford to show any signs of a European hangover here. Borussia Dortmund Team News Once again missing out away at Barcelona earlier in the week, Borussia Dortmund will be unable to call upon former Bayern Munich midfielder Marcel Sabitzer. Likewise, in what is a massive blow for Kovac’s side, BVB will be unable to call upon German international Nico Schlotterbeck for the remainder of the season. Making a cameo appearance off the bench in Catalonia, Niklas Sule could make a first start since the middle of February. Bagging 15 Bundesliga strikes this season, ex-Stuttgart striker Serhou Guirassy will lead the line in Munich. Bayern Munich vs Borussia Dortmund Key Factors to Consider When Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund met for their reverse Bundesliga meeting on November 30th, Saturday’s opponents played out a 1-1 stalemate in rural Germany. Bayern have won 11 of their previous 12 Bundesliga showdowns at the Allianz – a run that stems back to a 1-1 stalemate against Leverkusen on September 28th. England skipper Harry Kane has recorded 23 goals in his 26 Bundesliga appearances this season. Borussia Dortmund have failed to record consecutive Bundesliga victories on the road since April 2024. Dortmund’s three appearances since returning from March’s international break has produced 13 goals at both ends of the pitch. Conclusion Two German giants who suffered their own respective European blows in midweek, both camps will be desperately seeking an immediate response here. With Bayern Munich opening Saturday’s fixtures holding a six-point buffer at the top of the Bundesliga table, Kompany’s men will be looking to lay down what would be a real marker. With Dortmund claiming just a single victory at the Allianz since way back in 2017, we are backing what could prove to be an enjoyable home victory this weekend.
