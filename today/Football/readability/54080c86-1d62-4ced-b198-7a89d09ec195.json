  "text": "Competition: A-League Market: Goal to be scored in both halves Odds: 8/15 @ 1xBet In what could prove to be another frantic A-League showdown on Monday morning, Macarthur will welcome Adelaide to the Campbelltown Stadium. Starting with the hosts, while Macarthur might have shown some real inconsistencies when opening up the new campaign, the Bulls have come roaring back in some style. Last seen on New Year’s Day opening 2025 with a dramatic 3-2 victory away at Western Sydney, Mile Sterjovski’s side are in the midst of a real flurry. Sat firmly in the driving seat to punch another play-off ticket this year, the one-time Derby striker has seen his squad muster 10 points from their previous four A-League appearances. Signing off 2024 with a dominant 3-0 romp against Perth, Macarthur have also collected back-to-back victories for the first time this season. Snatching a 2-1 win away at Wellington last month, Monday’s hosts have found a real clinical edge in the final third. Including what was a remarkable 4-4 stalemate at home against Brisbane on November 30th, Sterjovski’s men have already notched 23 A-League strikes so far this season. However, it should be highlighted, the Sydney-based outfit have failed to record a single clean sheet on home soil since opening up the new campaign. As for the visitors, suffering a first A-League defeat of the season last time out, Adelaide will be seeking an immediate response here. Nevertheless, despite eventually falling to an action-packed 3-2 loss at home against Western Sydney when signing off 2024, Carl Veart’s men should find the mood in their camp at a continued high. Despite spending the whole of last year battling it out at the foot of the A-League table, Monday’s guests have shown a string of improvements this time around. Laying down a sensational marker last month as they stormed their way to a 4-0 romp away at Central Coast, Adelaide have their sights firmly set on clinching a play-off ticket in 2025. Losing just one of their first nine A-League appearances this season, the Reds have also gained a reputation for their remarkable success on the road. Including a 3-2 win against Brisbane on November 23rd, Adelaide have won all of their first four A-League showdowns away from Coopers Stadium by an aggregate score of 12-5. Bet: Goal to be scored in both halves at Macarthur FC vs Adelaide United 8/15 for Monday’s A-League battle @ 1xBet",
