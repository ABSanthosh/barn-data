  "text": "Verdict: Arsenal win Best Odds: 21/20 Bookmaker: Dachbet Desperate to make up some ground in the title chase, Arsenal will travel to St. James’ Park on Saturday lunchtime when they meet Newcastle. Newcastle Starting with the hosts, claiming some immediate revenge earlier in the week as they extended on their EFL Cup adventure thanks to a 2-0 win against Chelsea, Newcastle will be desperate to use that performance as a platform to build on. However, although Eddie Howe’s camp might have punched their quarter-final ticket on Wednesday night, the former Bournemouth boss has found some mounting pressure on his shoulders. Marking their return from October’s international break with a toothless performance at St. James’ Park as they fell to a 1-0 defeat against Brighton, the Magpies have collected just two points from any of their previous five Premier League appearances. Opening up this weekend’s fixtures scrapping it out in the bottom-half of the table, Newcastle should also be concerned by their most recent showdown against Saturday’s guests. Hit with a 4-1 drumming when they travelled to north London back on February 24th, Newcastle should have another stern challenge on their hands here. Team News Once again missing out at St. James’ Park earlier in the week, influential defender Kieran Trippier remains a major doubt on Saturday lunchtime. Likewise, yet to make a single appearance so far this season, Dutch star Sven Botman remains on the sidelines with a long-term knee injury. Finding the net in back-to-back showdowns against Chelsea over the past week, attacking talisman Alexander Isak will lead Howe’s charge. Although England international Anthony Gordon might have notched just a single goal since the end of August, the ex-Everton star will partner Isak. Arsenal As for the visitors, while Arsenal might have extended on their respective EFL Cup adventure earlier in the week as they clinched a 3-0 romp away at Championship outfit Preston, the Gunners have struggled to find much stability since returning from October’s international break. Eventually forced to settle for an action-packed 2-2 stalemate at home against Liverpool last weekend, Mikel Arteta’s side have watched their title dreams take a potential dent. Marking their return from October’s fortnight interval with a downbeat 2-0 defeat at the hands of Bournemouth, Arsenal have also shown some worrying defensive struggle while in top-flight action. Signing off September with a frantic 4-2 victory against Leicester, Arteta’s camp have failed to muster a single clean sheet from any of their previous five consecutive Premier League appearances. Travelling to St. James’ Park sat five points adrift in the title chase, Arsenal face what is a real must-win showdown here. Team News Yet to make a single appearance since sustaining an ankle injury while away with Norway during October’s international break, skipper Martin Odegaard remains a doubt here. Likewise, suffering a Champions League knock against Shakhtar last week, summer recruit Riccardo Calafiori is not expected to feature. After serving a one-match suspension against Liverpool last weekend, William Saliba will be handed a full Premier League return on Saturday lunchtime. Settling for a spot on the bench away at Preston in midweek, England international Bukayo Saka will spearhead Arteta’s attack. Key Factors to Consider When Newcastle and Arsenal last met back on February 24th, the Gunners collected a 4-1 romp in north London. Despite their EFL Cup victory against Chelsea in midweek, Newcastle have failed to win any of their previous five Premier League appearances. Arsenal have failed to record a clean sheet in any of their previous five Premier League outings. Five of Newcastle’s first six showdowns at St. James’ Park have finished with under 2.5 goals. England international Bukayo Saka has scored in each of his last three starts across all competitions. Conclusion Opening up their trip to St. James’ Park sat five points adrift in the title chase, Arsenal will have plenty of pressure on their shoulders here. Failing to collect a Premier League victory since returning from October’s international break, the Gunners are desperate to make up some ground and lay down a potential marker this weekend. Landing a stellar 4-1 romp when they welcomed Newcastle to north London back on February 24th, we are expecting an away victory on Saturday lunchtime.
