Real Madrid confirmed he has been diagnosed with sacroiliitis, which is inflammation of the joints connecting the lower spine to the pelvis, causing pain and stiffness in the lower back and hips. Spanish media have reported he requires a week of rest and treatment to recover from the issue, meaning he is unlikely to feature against either North Macedonia on Friday or against Wales the following Monday. However, he is expected to be available for the start of Madrid’s Club World Cup campaign, which begins against Al-Hilal on June 18. Courtois medical report. — Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadriden) June 1, 2025 Courtois made 47 appearances for Madrid in all competitions in 2024-25, keeping 15 clean sheets. He also boasted a save percentage of 72.1%, saving 143 of the 197 shots on target that he faced. Courtois returned to the Belgium set-up back in March after Rudi Garcia’s arrival and made his first appearance in nearly two years in their 3-1 defeat to Ukraine on March 20. Courtois had been named in Garcia’s squad for the World Cup qualifiers, with no replacement currently announced for the 33-year-old.",
