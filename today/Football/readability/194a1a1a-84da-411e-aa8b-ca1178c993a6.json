  "text": "Olivier Giroud has left Los Angeles FC by mutual consent, the club announced on Friday, with the striker expected to sign for Lille. Giroud joined LAFC in July 2024 following his departure from AC Milan, though he has struggled to make an impact in his 12 months at the club. He has scored just five goals in 37 games in all competitions, though only Denis Bouanga (23) and David Martinez (six) have outscored Giroud since his debut. Giroud has underperformed his 6.5 expected goals (xG), as he scored his haul from 18 shots on target (44 attempts overall). He helped the club lift their first U.S. Open Cup title in 2024, scoring in the final against Sporting Kansas City to help LAFC to a 3-1 victory. Giroud will play one final game for LAFC, who make their return to MLS after being knocked out of the Club World Cup at the end of the group stage. They face the Vancouver Whitecaps on Sunday. “I want to thank all of the fans, my team-mates and the staff at LAFC for making this an enjoyable stop in my career,” Giroud said. “I am happy to have played a part in the success of LAFC. From winning a trophy last season to participating in the Club World Cup, this has been a great experience in L.A. for me and my family.” Giroud is reportedly set to join Lille after his contract termination, with reports suggesting he will sign a two-year contract with the club. The 39-year-old would be returning to Ligue 1 for the first time in 13 years, having also played for Arsenal, Chelsea and Milan since he left Montpellier in 2012. Giroud is expected to replace Jonathan David, who announced he would be leaving Lille at the end of his contract after five years at the club.",
