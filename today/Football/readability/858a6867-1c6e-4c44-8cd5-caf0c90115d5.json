  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 13/11 Bookmaker: Luckster Desperately seeking an essential boost this weekend, Real Madrid will welcome Osasuna to the Spanish capital on Saturday afternoon. Real Madrid Starting with the hosts, coming under a huge amount of scrutiny last month as they signed off October with an infamous 4-0 drumming at home against arch-rivals Barcelona, Real Madrid have endured a public struggle over the past fortnight. Putting in another worrying Champions League performance earlier in the week as they suffered a shock 3-1 loss at the hands of AC Milan, Carlo Ancelotti’s superstar squad are desperately seeking an essential boost on Saturday afternoon. Although Los Blancos might have marked their return from October’s International break with a 2-1 win away at Celta Vigo, the one-time Everton boss will have a major headache over his side’s extended issues at the back. Along with shipping seven goals in their back-to-back defeats, Real Madrid have recorded just a single clean sheet from any of their previous 10 consecutive appearances across all competitions. Team News Once again missing out against AC Milan earlier in the week and still dealing with a recent muscle injury, Real Madrid will once again be without former Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Likewise, undergoing knee surgery last month, veteran defender Dani Carvajal is not expected to feature over the remainder of the season. Bagging what was a consolation Champions League strike in midweek, Vinicius Junior will once again parter French superstar Kylian Mbappe in the final third. Eduardo Camavinga could be handed a full recall on Saturday afternoon could replace Luka Modric. Osasuna As for the visitors, while Osasuna might have been left disappointed last season as they missed out on the chance to book a top-half finish, Los Rojillos have come roaring back in some style this time around. Extending on their Copa del Rey adventure earlier in the week as they stormed their way to a routine 5-0 romp against Chiclana, Vicente Moreno’s men have rightfully received a string of plaudits from across Spain’s elite. Last seen in La Liga action putting in another gritty performance as they clinched a 1-0 win at home against Valladolid, the mood around El Sadar appears to be at a red-hot high. Making a major statement last month as they claimed a 2-0 victory away at Real Sociedad, Saturday’s guests are riding a sensational wave of momentum. Along with losing just one of their previous eight appearances across all competitions, just their goal difference currently keeps them outside of the Champions League spots. Team News Heading into Saturday’s trip to the Spanish capital, Osasuna have reported a clean bill of health and have no fresh injury concerns to worry about. All handed a full Copa del Rey rest earlier in the week, the likes of Alejandro Catena, Jesus Areso and number one goalkeeper Sergio Herrera will make a full return on Saturday afternoon. Finding the net in back-to-back La Liga appearances and already registering six domestic strikes, veteran striker Ante Budimir will spearhead Moreno’s charge. Arriving from German giants Bayern Munich on a season-long loan switch, Spanish youngster Bryan Zaragoza will join Budimir in the final third. Key Factors to Consider When Osasuna and Real Madrid last met back on March 16th, Los Blancos collected an action-packed 4-2 win at El Sadar. Real Madrid have lost their last two appearances over the past fortnight by an aggregate score of 7-1. Los Blancos have recorded just a single clean sheet in any of their previous 10 appearances across all competitions. Osasuna have suffered just a single defeat from any of their previous eight matchups across all formats. Real Madrid have recorded just a sole clean sheet on home soil so far this season. Conclusion While Real Madrid might open Saturday’s showdown pencilled in as a landslide contender, there is no doubt that Osasuna will be relishing a trip to the Spanish capital. Continuing on what has been a sensational purple patch and suffering just a single defeat from any of their previous eight consecutive appearances, Los Rojillos find just their goal difference keeping them outside the Champions League spots. Despite being hit with a 4-2 loss when they welcomed Los Blancos to town back on March 16th, Osasuna should be confident of testing a leaky Madrid defence.
