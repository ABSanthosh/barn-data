  "text": "France made it back-to-back wins in the Nations League, with Christopher Nkunku and Bradley Barcola among the scorers as they thrashed Israel 4-1 in Hungary. Playing at a neutral venue in Budapest’s Bozsik Arena, France flew out of the traps as Israel goalkeeper Omri Glazer let Eduardo Camavinga’s strike squirm past him in the sixth minute. Israel did draw level midway through the first half as Omri Gandelman headed Oscar Gloukh’s cross home, but they were on terms for less than five minutes as Chelsea forward Nkunku flicked the ball through Ilay Feingold’s legs before slotting a low finish into the far corner. Randal Kolo Muani twice went close to extending France’s lead before Matteo Guendouzi gave them breathing space in the 87th minute, rolling a finish beyond Glazer and into the bottom corner. Didier Deschamps’ men added further gloss to the scoreline two minutes later, Guendouzi finding a similar position, but this time opting to pick out Barcola for a curled finish. The result sees France move onto six points in Group A2, one adrift of Italy – who beat them on matchday one. They face Belgium next time out on Monday.",
