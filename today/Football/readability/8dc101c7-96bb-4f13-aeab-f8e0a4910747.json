  "text": "Inter Miami survived goalkeeper Oscar Ustari’s first-half red card to snatch a 1-0 victory over Charlotte FC and move up to second in the Eastern Conference. Tadeo Allende scored the only goal 17 seconds after the break, combining brilliantly with Luis Suarez to earn Javier Mascherano his second MLS win since taking charge. The Herons started brightly in the contest as Benjamin Cremaschi registered the first shot on target, but his effort was comfortably gathered by visiting goalkeeper Kristijan Kahlina. However, Miami were reduced to 10-men seven minutes before half-time after Ustari raced out of his goal and tripped Wilfried Zaha, having seen the former Crystal Palace forward take the ball past him. And despite being a man down, Miami got themselves ahead early in the second half when Allende collected Suarez’s chipped pass before finishing into the bottom right corner. Charlotte had their chances to level the contest, though, with Patrick Agyemang going close with a header, followed by Idan Toklomati striking the base of the post. But Dean Smith’s side were unable to find a way through in the closing stages, leaving them sixth in the standings following their first defeat of the new season. GANAMOS pic.twitter.com/zeECYzEuJO — Inter Miami CF (@InterMiamiCF) March 9, 2025 Data Debrief: Red mist descends again for Miami Having picked up five red cards across his 638 career appearances, Mascherano’s combative approach as a player has seemingly transpired in his coaching journey, with Miami seeing yet another player sent off this season. Indeed, the Herons have had three players sent off so far this term, with Tomas Aviles and Ian Fray dismissed against New York City FC and the Houston Dynamo respectively. Though only registering an expected goals (xG) total of 0.54 from their four shots, Miami were able to restrict their opponents to no efforts on goal, with Yannick Bright playing a pivotal role in earning the clean sheet. Bright ended the contest having won a team-high five tackles, while only Gonzalo Lujan (nine) made more clearances than the Italian (seven).",
