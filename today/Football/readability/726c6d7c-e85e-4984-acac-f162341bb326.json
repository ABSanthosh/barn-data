  "text": "Verdict: Lille win Best Odds: 1/1 Bookmaker: Dachbet Looking to make a Ligue 1 statement on their return from November’s international break, Lille will welcome Rennes to the Stade Pierre-Mauroy on Sunday afternoon. Lille Starting with the hosts, while Lille might have been forced to settle for three stalemates on the bounce prior to November’s international break, the Mastiffs have continued on an impressive flurry over the past couple of months. Springing what was an almighty Champions League upset back on October 2nd as they claimed a famous 1-0 win against reigning European champions Real Madrid, Bruno Genesio’s men have their sights firmly set on booking another top-four finish this season. Collecting another heavyweight Spanish scalp last month as they stormed their way to a 3-1 victory away at Atletico Madrid, Lille should be smelling another golden opportunity here. In fact, Sunday’s hosts are unbeaten in all of their last 10 consecutive appearances across all competitions – a run that stems back to September 17th. Team News Still dealing with a long-term knee injury and yet to make a single Ligue 1 appearance so far this season, former Barcelona defender Samuel Umtiti remains on the sidelines. Likewise, Lille will also be without the likes of Nabil Bentaleb, Rafael Fernandes and ex-Everton midfielder Andre Gomes. Recording 13 goals across all competitions so far this season and attracting plenty of heavyweight transfer interest, attacking talisman Jonathan David will lead the line on Sunday afternoon. Once again featuring for England over the international break, Angel Gomes should start in the middle of the park. Rennes As for the visitors, while Rennes might have signed off October with a much-needed 1-0 win against Le Havre, it appears that might have just been a minor boost. Enduring what has quickly become a public Ligue 1 struggle since opening up the new campaign, new boss Jorge Sampaoli appears to have a real job on his hands. Heading into November’s international break with a toothless 2-0 loss at home against Toulouse, Les Rennais mark their return on Sunday afternoon holding just a one-point buffer from slipping into the drop zone. Coming under a huge amount of scrutiny earlier in the month as they fell to a 4-0 drumming away at Auxerre, Rennes have collected just a sole win from any of their previous seven Ligue 1 showdowns. Suddenly at the heart of a real relegation scrap, Sampaoli’s downbeat squad should be bracing themselves for another stern examination here. Team News Yet to make a single appearance so far this season and still dealing with a long-term knee injury, Rennes will once again be without Turkish goalkeeper Dogan Alemdar this weekend. However, despite the former Troyes loanee, Sunday’s guests have no fresh injury concerns to worry about. Making the permeant move from Championship outfit Leeds over the summer, Finland international Glen Kamara will start in the middle of the park. Featuring from France’s U21s over the past fortnight, former PSG youngster Arnaud Kalimuendo will shoulder most of Rennes’ goalscoring threat. Key Factors to Consider When Lille and Rennes last met back on March 10th, Sunday’s opponents played out an action-packed 2-2 draw at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. Four of the previous five meetings between Lille and Rennes have finished in a stalemate. The Mastiffs are unbeaten in each of their previous 10 appearances across all competitions. Rennes have collected just a single win from any of their previous seven Ligue 1 appearances. Sunday’s guests have failed to win any of their last six straight trips to the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. Conclusion Unbeaten in each of their previous 10 appearances across all competitions and collecting some famous scalps, Lille should be looking to extend on their recent purple patch here. Pencilled in as a standout contender on Sunday afternoon, the Mastiffs should be confident of cashing in on a Rennes squad who find themselves at the heart of a public crisis. Marking their return from November’s international break remarkably holding just a one-point buffer from dropping into the relegation zone, we are backing a home victory this weekend.
