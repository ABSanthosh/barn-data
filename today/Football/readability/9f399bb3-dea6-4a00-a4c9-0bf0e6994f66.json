  "text": "Lautaro Martinez believes Inter have earned the respect of Europe’s elite following their run to the Champions League final, where they face Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday. Inter are out for European glory once again in Munich, competing in their seventh European Cup/UEFA Champions League final, and first since 2023. Simone Inzaghi’s side were beaten by Manchester City 1-0 in the showpiece match two years ago, with this season’s Serie A runners-up out for revenge this time around. Martinez has been key to Inter’s success in the Champions League, scoring in the last 16, quarter-final and semi-final of this season’s competition, and could join an elite group of players should he find the back of the net in the final. Indeed, only Frank Lampard in 2007-08, Diego Milito in 2009-10, Lionel Messi in 2010-11, Cristiano Ronaldo in 2013-14 and Sadio Mane in 2017-18 have managed to do so. The Argentina international is also aiming to become the first Inter player with 10 goals in a major European season (currently nine), but he only has one focus in Munich. “I scored many goals in important Champions League games,” Martinez said. “I am happy to be playing my second Final in three years, which is thanks to the hard work, sacrifice and humility of everyone here. “We have improved as a team, facing strong opponents in very difficult atmospheres, defeating sides who had long unbeaten runs. “Inter earned respect throughout the competition, working hard, keeping our heads down and focusing on ourselves. “Now we can bring this trophy home after such a long time and want the perfect performance.” Inter boss Inzaghi lost the 2023 Champions League final and is looking to avoid becoming the ninth manager to lose two or more finals. The only two managers to lose their first final but win their second are Fabio Capello (lost 1993, won 1994) and Thomas Tuchel (lost 2020, won 2021). But despite that hanging over him, Inzaghi has had an impressive tenure with Inter, winning 141 of his 216 matches in charge across all competitions (D41 L34). Ahead of kick-off, the build-up has been dominated by reports that Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal have offered Inzaghi a €30m per season salary to leave Inter. “News emerges every day, we are relaxed, he is still here and works every day to improve the squad,” assured Inter captain Martinez. “If we win, we’ll certainly dedicate it to him, the fans and or families.” Martinez has also been tempted many times by huge offers, but always remained committed to Inter. “This club adopted me as if I was born here, so I will always thank them for what they did for me,” he added. “Tomorrow we can bring this trophy back to Milan and will try to enjoy this evening, because you don’t get to do this every day.”",
