  "text": "Martin Zubimendi rejected the chance to join Liverpool this summer, choosing to stay at Real Sociedad. There have been rumours about him possibly regretting his decision, though he has always maintained that he remains loyal to the Basque club. More recently, the 25-year-old Spain international has been linked very heavily with Manchester City, who have lost the services of Rodri for the season due to an ACL injury. Zubimendi was the player who occasionally replaced Rodri for Spain at the Euros this year, and it only seems natural for the Premier League champions to consider moving for him in January to fill the void. However, Zubimendi still isn’t interested in leaving San Sebastian. “There are always rumours but so far I’ve always thought that the best solution for me is staying at Real Sociedad,” he’s been quoted in saying. “I’ve still a lot of things to give to this club, I still want to grow and develop here.”",
