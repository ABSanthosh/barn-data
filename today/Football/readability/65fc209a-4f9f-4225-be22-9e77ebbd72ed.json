  "text": "Competition: League One Market: Both teams to score Odds: 4/5 @ Pribet Hoping to extend their buffer in the play-off chase, Huddersfield will travel to the Abbey Stadium on Friday night when they meet Cambridge. Starting with the hosts, while Cambridge might have claimed a crucial 4-1 victory against Shrewsbury earlier in the month, it appears that might have just been a minor boost for Garry Monk’s men. Despite snatching a dramatic 2-2 stalemate away at Wrexham last weekend, the one-time Swansea boss has seen his squad muster just a single win from any of their previous nine appearances across all competitions. With that extended rut stemming all the way back to November 5th, the Us find themselves at the heart of a relegation scrap. Opening Friday’s showdown sat four points adrift of safety, Monk’s side should be bracing themselves for another tricky test this weekend. Crashing out of the EFL Trophy earlier in the month as they fell to a 2-1 loss away at Cheltenham, Cambridge should take some solace from their rugged success on home soil. In fact, Friday’s hosts are unbeaten in each of their previous five League One showdowns at the Abbey Stadium – a run that stems back to October 1st. As for the visitors, while some in Huddersfield’s camp would have been left disappointed last weekend as they eventually had to settle for an action-packed 2-2 stalemate at home against Lincoln, Michael Duff’s men should find the mood in their camp at a real high. Securing a 2-1 victory away at Mansfield earlier in the month, the Terriers have collected 13 points from their previous five League One appearances. Opening Friday’s showdown sat in the driving seat to punch a play-off ticket, it is no secret that the Yorkshire-based outfit have their sights firmly set on securing an immediate Championship return in 2025. However, although Huddersfield might be enjoying a recent flurry, the former Barnsley boss will be calling on his squad to find their own respective defensive stability. Watching their EFL Trophy campaign come to an end on December 10th as they suffered a 3-1 loss away at Bolton, Duff’s side have registered just a pair of clean sheets from any of their last nine matchups across all competitions. Likewise, Huddersfield have notched just a sole clean sheet away from the John Smith’s Stadium since October 22nd. Bet: Both teams to score at Cambridge United vs Huddersfield Town 4/5 for Friday’s League One matchup @ Pribet",
