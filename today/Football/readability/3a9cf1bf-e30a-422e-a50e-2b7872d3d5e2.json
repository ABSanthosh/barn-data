  "text": "Simone Inzaghi believes Inter are outsiders for their Champions League quarter-final tie with Bayern Munich, with three key players doubtful for Tuesday’s first leg. Inter go to the Allianz Arena faced with the unenviable task of attempting to halt Bayern’s 22-game unbeaten run at home in the Champions League. The last visiting team to win at Bayern in the competition was Paris Saint-Germain, who triumphed 3-2 in the first leg of a last-eight tie four years ago. Inzaghi feels Bayern deserve to be treated as one of the favourites to win the tournament, having eased past Bundesliga champions Bayer Leverkusen in the last 16. “They are an experienced squad, they have absences just like us. They press hard, are intense and for many years have gone far in this competition,” Inzaghi told reporters. “Along with Real Madrid they are the big favourites for the trophy, but we are still coming here to play a great game.” Inter remain in the hunt for a treble, sitting top of the Serie A table and reaching the Coppa Italia semi-finals. “We know what our path has been, that I’ve been here for four years and we never chose between tournaments,” Inzaghi continued. “We always gave priority to the next match, know we are representing a great club and will try to cause problems for everyone.” Allianz Arena Ci siamo.#ForzaInter #UCL #BayernMonacoInter pic.twitter.com/j4WtMJWb8P — Inter (@Inter) April 7, 2025 However, the Nerazzurri’s final push towards the end of the season could be compromised by fatigue-related injuries, with Hakan Calhanoglu, Alessandro Bastoni and Federico Dimarco doubtful for the Bayern game. “Bastoni and Calhanoglu trained with the squad this morning, so they need to be evaluated, while Dimarco worked separately,” Inzaghi said. “Lautaro Martinez was only meant to play the first half at Parma (a 2-2 draw on Saturday) but he played 70 minutes. He is fine and I think he will play tomorrow.” When questioned about his strategy to counter Bayern’s renowned intensity, Inzaghi highlighted the importance of teamwork. “It’s a characteristic of Bayern. Every time I’ve faced them, I’ve found them to be an intense team,” he said. “It will be a match to approach with energy and determination, all together. Everyone will need to be involved.”",
