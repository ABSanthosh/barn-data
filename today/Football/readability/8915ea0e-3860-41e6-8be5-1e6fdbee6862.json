The report has claimed that the La Liga club have made an initial contact over a move for Rashford. Rashford has failed to impress United manager Ruben Amorim and has been made available for a transfer by the Premier League giants in the January window. The forward is open to joining Barcelona, who are now actively trying to get a deal done for the 27-year-old England international. AS Monaco are also keen on Rashford. While Barcelona, who are aiming to win La Liga this season, are in contact with United over a deal for Rashford, the main issue will be over finances. The Spanish and European giants are not in great financial health, and it remains to be seen if they are able to get the deal over the line this month.",
