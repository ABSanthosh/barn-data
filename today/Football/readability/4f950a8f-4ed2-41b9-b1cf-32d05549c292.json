  "text": "Competition: Brazil Serie B Market: Both teams to score – No Odds: 8/11 @ BetUS In what could be a cagey Serie B showdown late on Thursday night, Operario will welcome CRB to the Germano Kruger. Starting with the hosts, although Operario might have clinched a much-welcomed 2-0 victory against Novorizontino, it appears that might have been just a minor boost for Rafael Guanaes’ downbeat squad. Last seen putting in another toothless performance as they had to settle for a 0-0 stalemate against Vila Nova, the Parana-based outfit have put just a single point on the board from their previous three Serie B appearances. It should also be noted, the Ghost Train have recorded just a sole win from any of their last nine matchups across all competitions – a rut that stems back to a 3-0 victory against Botafogo on May 17th. Signing off June with a 1-0 defeat at the hands of fellow strugglers Volta Redonda, Thursday’s hosts have also shown some major attacking issues so far this season. In fact, Guanaes’ side have registered just a single Serie B strike in almost 300 minutes of action. As for the visitors, despite clinching their own essential 2-0 victory against Goias last month, CRB find themselves stuck in an almost identical position to Thursday’s opponents. Despite just clinging to their Serie B status last season, the Alagoas-based outfit are once again looking over their shoulder at another looming relegation scrap. Last seen putting in another downbeat display as they slumped to a 1-0 loss at home against Coritiba, Umberto Louzer’s side have now lost all of their previous four consecutive appearances. Including another 1-0 loss away at Ferroviaria last month, Thursday’s guests have also shown their own extended issues in the final third. It should be highlighted, CRB have failed to record more than a single strike in 14 of their previous 16 matchups across all competitions – a rut that stems all the way back to the middle of April. In what should prove to be another cagey Serie B affair, chances should come at a premium. Bet: Both teams *not* to score at Operario vs CRB 8/11 for Thursday’s Brazil Serie B battle @ BetUS",
