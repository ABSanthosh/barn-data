  "text": "Thomas Tuchel made a winning start as England manager, earning a 2-0 victory over Albania in their first World Cup qualifier. Miles Lewis-Skelly scored on his debut, with Harry Kane making sure of the win with 13 minutes remaining at Wembley Stadium on Friday. England dominated in the opening stages but took until the 20th minute to unlock Albania’s low block, with Jude Bellingham sliding a lovely throughball into the box for Lewis-Skelly, who slotted his shot under Thomas Strakosha. The goalkeeper was then called into action in the 40th minute, stretching out a leg to block Bellingham’s diving header, with Kane’s follow-up deflected over the bar by Berat Djimsiti’s goal-saving block. There was nearly a second debut goal just before the break. Dan Burn rose high to meet a corner and sent a towering header at goal, but it smacked the crossbar, with a glancing touch from Strakosha. Kane led from the front in the second half, heading narrowly wide shortly after the hour before getting his reward in the 77th minute. The striker latched onto Declan Rice’s cross, bringing it down with a superb first touch before picking out the bottom-right corner with a clinical finish. Off to a winning start A 2-0 success to start the Thomas Tuchel era and our @FIFAWorldCup qualifying campaign. pic.twitter.com/lXJYDIJsHA — England (@England) March 21, 2025 Data Debrief: A debut to remember Lewis-Skelly, who became the fourth-youngest England player to make his debut (18y 176d), also became the youngest player in history to score on his senior debut for the national team, surpassing Marcus Rashford’s record of 18 years and 209 days against Australia in May 2016. Overall, he is the third-youngest scorer for the Three Lions, after only Wayne Rooney (17y 317d in September 2003) and Michael Owen (18y 164d in May 1998). Kane, meanwhile, continued his fine run for England, with this goal his 70th. He is the first player to score on his first appearance under three different managers (Roy Hodgson, Gareth Southgate and Tuchel). Each of the last 11 permanent England managers have now won their first game in charge, with Tuchel keeping that run intact with a comfortable victory that sends his side top of Group K after the first match.",
