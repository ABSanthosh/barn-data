  "text": "Matheus Cunha has signed a new contract to keep him at Wolves until 2029. The Wolves forward, who scored in their 2-0 win over Aston Villa on Saturday, put pen to paper on a new four-and-a-half-year deal. Cunha has been linked with a move away from Molineux in recent weeks, with the likes of Arsenal and Nottingham Forest reportedly interested in signing him, but he has chosen to stay at the club this transfer window. Vitor Pereira said after that win, which saw them move two points clear of the relegation zone, that Cunha had decided to stay before the news was confirmed later in the day. The Brazilian scored his 25th Premier League goal against Villa, becoming just the second player to reach this milestone for Wolves after Raul Jimenez (40). He is their leading scorer in the top-flight this term, with 11 goals, while he has also registered four assists.

It’s always important to us that we reward our strongest and most impactful players, and Matheus deserves this new deal.”",
