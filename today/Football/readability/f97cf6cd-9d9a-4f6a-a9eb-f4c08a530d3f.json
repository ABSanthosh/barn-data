  "text": "Nottingham Forest have announced that Morgan Gibbs-White has signed a new contract with the club. The 24-year-old agreed to a three-year deal, keeping him at the City Ground until 2028 despite speculation of a possible exit. Tottenham reportedly triggered the midfielder’s release clause and booked a medical before Forest claimed the London club did not act in a legal manner. Gibbs-White scored seven goals in the Premier League last season and also provided eight assists, marking back-to-back seasons with 15 direct goal contributions in the league. He helped Forest qualify for European football for the 2025-26 season and is excited for what is to come at the club. “I’ve felt at home at Forest from the moment I arrived,” Gibbs-White told the Forest website. “The support from the fans, my teammates, and everyone around the club has been unbelievable. “I believe in what we’re building here – and with the backing of Mr Marinakis and the enormous ambition he has, I want to be part of making something special. I’m excited for what’s to come.” A statement of intent from our owner Evangelos Marinakis, as Morgan Gibbs-White signs a record deal at the Club until the summer of 2028. pic.twitter.com/WhvuhecdhI — Nottingham Forest (@NFFC) July 26, 2025 Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis added: “Morgan is a special player – not just in terms of talent, but character and mentality. He represents everything we want this football club to be: he is a winner, talented, ambitious, fearless, and proud. “There was significant interest from various clubs, but we were determined to build our future with Morgan at the heart of it. I promised our fans we would not only compete, but grow stronger and stronger every season. Today is another big step in that journey.”",
