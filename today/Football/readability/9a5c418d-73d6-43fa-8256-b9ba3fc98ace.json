  "text": "Kerry Zavagnin believes Sporting Kansas City need to work on staying focused and challenge themselves to be better ahead of their meeting with San Jose Earthquakes. Zavagnin took over as interim coach following the departure of long-time head coach Peter Vermes and, in his first game, guided Sporting KC to a win over St. Louis City, snapping a 13-game winless run. But the joy quickly evaporated as his side lost 4-2 to Portland Timbers last Saturday, with David Ayala and Kevin Kelsey starring. Dejan Joveljic managed a consolation goal after Jansen Miller turned the ball into his own net, though Joveljic promptly missed a penalty in the dying minutes to cap off a disappointing evening. Reflecting on the game, Zavagnin called for his side to improve their concentration and stay focused to avoid defensive lapses. “Portland pressed us a little bit higher; they went for it, and sometimes it’s those moments in games – and they’re not very long, they are three or four minutes — that can turn the game on its head,” Zavagnin said. “The teams that lose that concentration more often and in decisive moments are the ones that are penalised. “The challenge is always to get better, not just physically better from a fitness perspective, but a concentration fitness perspective. That’s a work in progress.” Sporting KC are currently 14th in the Western Conference with four points, while the San Jose Earthquakes are ninth with 10 points. The Earthquakes lost out to Los Angeles FC last weekend, with Sergi Palencia and Denis Bouanga getting on the scoresheet. Cristian Espinoza could only manage a 95th-minute consolation goal as Bruce Arena’s side lost for the fourth time this season. “It’s a game we could’ve got something out of,” Arena said. “I think we played fairly well. “It was a good game. It was a physical game, and I thought both teams competed very well.” Next match: vs. SKC at @paypalpark and Country Night pic.twitter.com/kbKd5ZC8Ax — San Jose Earthquakes (@SJEarthquakes) April 7, 2025 PLAYERS TO WATCH San Jose Earthquakes – Cristian Arango Cristian Arango has scored five goals in eight career regular-season matches against Sporting Kansas City, only scoring more against FC Dallas (six). Since Arango debuted in MLS in August 2021, only Jordan Morris (six) has found the net more times against Sporting. Sporting Kansas City – Dejan Joveljic Joveljic has scored seven goals in 10 career regular-season matches against San Jose, three more than he has scored against any other opponent in his MLS career. Since Joveljic debuted in MLS in August 2021, no player has scored more goals against a single opponent (tied with three others).

San Jose have not defeated Sporting twice in a single season since 2015. San Jose recorded a 6-1 home win over D.C. United in their last home match. The Earthquakes have won three of their last nine at PayPal Park, scoring 13 goals over the three wins while totalling just three total goals in the other six games (D1 L5). Meanwhile, Sporting Kansas City have lost eight straight away from home in all competitions, the longest road losing streak in club history (excluding breakaway shootout losses). Sporting have one win in their last 18 away matches (W1 D1), with the lone win in that time a 2-1 victory at San Jose last July. OPTA WIN PROBABILITY San Jose Earthquakes – 44.4% Draw – 26.8% Sporting Kansas City – 28.8%",
