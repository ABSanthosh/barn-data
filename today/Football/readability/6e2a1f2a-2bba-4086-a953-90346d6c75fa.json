  "text": "Gabriel Martinelli labelled Arsenal team-mate Bukayo Saka as “one of the best players in the world”, saying no one in the Gunners squad can replace the England international. Saka is expected to miss up to two months of action after undergoing hamstring surgery after picking up an issue in their 5-1 win over Crystal Palace earlier this month. But Mikel Arteta’s side have fared well in his absence, earning three consecutive Premier League victories, the latest of which came against Brentford on Wednesday. That run of results has moved Arsenal up to second in the table and six points behind leaders Liverpool, though Arne Slot’s side have a game in hand over the Gunners. Arsenal’s quality in reserve has proved pivotal in recent weeks, with Martinelli along with compatriot Gabriel Jesus rediscovering their goal-scoring touch at just the right time. They both scored against the Bees, with Jesus cancelling out Bryan Mbeumo’s opener before Martinelli concluded the scoring after Mikel Merino had put the Gunners ahead. Martinelli has now scored in three of his last four Premier League away outings (three goals), more than his previous 26 on the road in the competition beforehand (two goals). Jesus, meanwhile, has scored six goals in his last four Arsenal appearances in all competitions – as many as his previous 48 beforehand. But despite his fine form since Saka’s injury, Martinelli relayed that his team-mate was among the elite in world football. “No-one can replace him. He is one of the best players in the world. We trust in ourselves, and we will try our best for the club,” Martinelli told TNT Sports. Martinelli has now scored six goals in 25 appearances in all competitions this season, just two short of matching his entire total from the 2023-24 campaign. The Brazilian starred in Arsenal’s title challenge two seasons ago, scoring 15 Premier League goals in 36 outings, his best return since his move from Ituano in 2019. While Martinelli lauded his side for earning their first top-flight away win after going a goal down since February 2023, he spoke of the difficulties he’s faced in the last two years. “I think the team did great today,” Martinelli added. “To come here and play the way we played is amazing. “Of course, the most important thing is the three points, and we did it, but then the most important thing was how we reacted, and we did it.” “I keep working and everyone at the club can tell how I work every day, not just me but everyone. I don’t give up, and it is not easy to play for a big club like Arsenal. “Now I can score, and I am very happy – I want to keep scoring to help the team.” After the game, Arteta was reserved in his assessment of whether Arsenal could catch Liverpool in their quest for the Premier League title. Martinelli, meanwhile, was more confident in his team-mates, saying: “Yes, for sure, the previous two years were amazing. We didn’t win the league, but we were there fighting.”",
