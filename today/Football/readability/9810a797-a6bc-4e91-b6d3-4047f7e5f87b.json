  "text": "Verdict: Goal to be scored in both halves Best Odds: 7/10 Bookmaker: Olympusbet In what could prove to be a season-defining showdown from the Midlands on Saturday evening, Aston Villa will host Nottingham Forest. Aston Villa Starting with the hosts, putting in another dominant display earlier in the week as they cruised their way to a 3-0 romp away at Brighton, Aston Villa have certainly hit top gear at a crucial time. Storming their way to an iconic Champions League quarter-final ticket last month as they claimed a 6-1 aggregate win against Belgium-based giants Club Brugge, Unai Emery’s men are enjoying what has become quite the purple patch. Booking their FA Cup final four spot last weekend as they secure another 3-0 victory against Preston, the one-time Arsenal boss has seen his squad win each of their previous six appearances across all competitions. Making it no secret that they have their sights firmly set on punching another top-four finish come May, Villa have also found a real clinical edge in the final third. In fact, Saturday’s hosts have notched a trio of goals in four of their last five matchups across all fronts. Aston Villa Team News Not making a single appearance since the start of January, former Chelsea star Ross Barkley remains on the sidelines with a long-term knee issue. However, recently receiving from a muscle issue, Belgium international Amadou Onana could make a first Premier League start since January 18th. Once again forced to settle for a spot on the bench in midweek, Ollie Watkins will be hoping for a full recall here. Once again getting on the scoresheet away at Brighton on Wednesday and notching three goals in his back-to-back appearances over the past week, Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford will be looking to extend on his recent flurry. Nottingham Forest As for the visitors, while Nottingham Forest might have only just clung to their Premier League status last season, Nuno Espírito Santo has seen his record-breaking squad embark on a sensational fairytale. Firmly cementing their spot as one of Europe’s ultimate surprise packages, the former Wolves boss has seen his squad gain a string of plaudits from across the continent. Opening this weekend’s fixtures remarkably sat in bronze medal position, Saturday’s guests are storming their way to what would be an iconic Champions League ticket in 2025. Securing what was a deserved 1-0 victory against Manchester United earlier in the week, Forest have continued to shatter a string of records. Winning all of their previous five appearances across all competitions, Santo’s men will be looking to lay down another heavyweight top-four marker when they travel to the Midlands this weekend. Nottingham Forest Team News Both limping off against Manchester United earlier in the week with respective first-half knocks, Nottingham Forest are sweating over the fitness of Danilo and former Fulham defender Ola Aina here. However, despite picking up a hip injury while away with New Zealand during March’s international break, Chris Wood should return to Santo’s squad. Finding the net against his former club on Wednesday and now notching three Premier League goals on either side of March’s fortnight break, Anthony Elanga could play a leading role in the Midlands. Nicolas Dominguez could be handed a full recall and partner Elliot Anderson in the middle of the park. Key Factors to Consider When Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest met for their reverse Premier League showdown on December 14th, Saturday’s guests collected a 2-1 victory at the City Ground. Nottingham Forest have won each of their previous five appearances across all competitions. Likewise, Aston Villa have won all of their last six consecutive outings across all fronts. Emery’s men have notched a trio of goals in four of their last five appearances across all competitions. Five of the last seven meetings between Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest have finished with both teams finding the net. Conclusion Two camps who find the moods in their respective camps at a red-hot high, we could be set for a season-defining showdown from the Midlands this weekend. Watching Nottingham Forest land a 2-1 victory when they welcomed Villa to the City Ground for their reverse Premier League meeting on December 14th, the Champions League chasers do have a habit of producing enjoyable contests when they meet. Likewise, with Saturday’s hosts really finding a clinical edge in the final third on either side of March’s international break, we could be treated to a thriller from Villa Park.
