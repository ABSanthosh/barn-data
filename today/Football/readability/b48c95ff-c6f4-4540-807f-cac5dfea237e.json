  "text": "San Jose Earthquakes played D.C. United in the first-ever MLS game on April 6, 1996, with Bruce Arena on the touchline for the latter. Thirty seasons later, and 29 years to the day, he will take charge of the Earthquakes in the anniversary match. San Jose won their first two matches under Arena this season but have since gone winless in their last four, leaving them 10th in the Western Conference. Arena lost that match in 1996, with San Jose coming out on top in a 1-0 victory, and he will be hoping his team can get back to winning ways on a special day. “It was an exciting time, and the goal was to really elevate the sport in our country, and I think 30 years later, we’ve done that. Obviously, there’s a lot more to do,” Arena, 73, said ahead of Sunday’s game. “It’s been a privilege to be part of this. I’ve coached the Olympic team, the national team, and four teams now in MLS. It’s been a great experience for me to be part of that. “I’m happy to still be around 30 years later. Hopefully, I’m around, let’s not say, another 30 years, but hopefully a little bit longer as well.” Season 1 Season 30 A full circle moment awaits when San Jose and D.C. meet Sunday, 29 years since the league’s inaugural match: https://t.co/ZRtj7k3Mqk pic.twitter.com/znxRbz7dkY — Major League Soccer (@MLS) April 5, 2025 D.C. have won just once so far this season, leaving them 12th in the Eastern Conference. Like their opponents, they are also on a winless streak, having failed to emerge victorious from any of their last three outings. D.C. head coach Troy Lesesne is delighted to be on the touchline for the unique occasion, recalling his memories of that first match. “It’s an incredible weekend for our club and the league,” he said. “I can remember watching this game when I was 12 years old and trying to find soccer anywhere and everywhere, and there wasn’t a lot of it. I can vividly remember it. “We want to celebrate this weekend, our club’s legacy, and the impact that team has had. We want to celebrate it with a good performance. It’s pretty surreal to be a part of this.” PLAYERS TO WATCH San Jose Earthquakes – Josef Martinez Josef Martinez has scored eight goals in 14 career regular-season appearances against D.C. United, equaling his most against any opponent (also vs. New England Revolution and Orlando City). No player has scored more goals against D.C. United since Martinez made his MLS debut in 2017. D.C. United – Christian Benteke Christian Benteke scored D.C. United’s lone goal in their 2-1 defeat to Columbus Crew. Benteke has scored 11 goals in regular-season play since MLS returned from the Leagues Cup break last season, as only New York City FC’s Alonso Martinez (12) has more in that time.
