  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 3/5 Bookmaker: Olympusbet In what could prove to be another enjoyable MLS showdown in the early hours of Sunday, San Jose will welcome the New York Red Bulls to PayPal Park. San Jose Earthquakes Starting with the hosts, while San Jose might have secured an action-packed 4-2 victory away at Dallas on June 26th, the Goonies have drastically struggled to find any kind of stability. Although Bruce Arena’s men might be sat firmly in the driving seat to punch a play-off return this season, the California-based outfit have mustered just a pair of wins from any of their previous eight consecutive MLS appearances – a run that stems back to May 11th. Eventually forced to settle for a 1-1 stalemate at home against LA Galaxy last time out, San Jose are also seeking some crucial defensive steel. Including a pulsating 3-3 draw against Houston on May 25th, Sunday’s hosts have have failed to muster a single MLS clean sheet in front of their own supporters since the end of February. San Jose Earthquakes Team News Still dealing with a long-term knee injury and yet to make a single MLS appearance since opening up the 2025 campaign, one-time Southampton youngster Noel Buck remains on the sidelines. Finding the net against LA Galaxy last week and now recording consecutive MLS strikes, 21-year-old Beau Leroux will partner Canadian international Mark-Anthony Kaye in the middle of the park. Former New England star David Romney will start at the heart of Arena’s defence. New York Red Bulls As for the visitors, while New York might have mustered just a pair of points from their previous three MLS appearances, the Red Bulls are enjoying what has been a bright run since their May blip. Getting June underway with a 2-0 victory against Atlanta, Sandro Schwarz’s men have come skyrocketed their way up the Eastern Conference standings. With just their goal difference keeping them outside the top-seven, Sunday’s guests have lost just one of their previous seven appearances across all competitions. Extending on their US Open Cup adventure on May 22nd as they edged past Dallas, New York will also be excited by a dominant record against the Goonies. Including a 1-0 victory when they last met San Jose on February 8th, they are unbeaten in all of their last seven meetings (six wins, one draw). New York Red Bulls Team News Missing out last weekend after picking up another reported muscle issue, New York are once again expected to be without former Inter Miami midfielder Lewis Morgan. However, featuring for Costa Rica at this summer’s Gold Cup, Andy Rojas should return to Schwarz’s squad here. Once again finding the net against Minnesota last weekend and recording 11 MLS strikes since arriving from Bayern Munich ahead of the 2025 campaign, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting will play a leading role in the final third. San Jose Earthquakes vs New York Red Bulls Key Factors to Consider New York are unbeaten in all of their last seven meetings against San Jose across all competitions (six wins, one draw). The Red Bulls have suffered just a single defeat from their previous seven appearances across all competitions. San Jose have failed to register a single MLS clean sheet in front of their own supporters since the end of February. Likewise, each of their last nine straight MLS matchups in California have finished with both teams finding the net. New York have registered just a sole MLS win on their travels so far this season. Conclusion While New York might hold a dominant recent record against Sunday’s hosts, the Red Bulls have drastically failed to find any kind of stability on their travels. Putting just a single MLS victory on the board outside of New Jersey so far this season, Schwarz’s side find themselves pencilled in as a real underdog contender here. However, it should be noted, with San Jose seeing all of their last nine straight MLS home fixtures finish with both teams finding the net, we are expecting a similar outcome this weekend. Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 3/5 Bookmaker: Olympusbet",
