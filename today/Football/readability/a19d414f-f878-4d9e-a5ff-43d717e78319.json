Carlo Ancelotti was unable to mark his Selecao debut with a win against Ecuador, leaving Brazil in fourth place after 15 rounds, while Paraguay arrive sitting two points clear of the five-time world champions. Brazil Much was said about Ancelotti’s debut as Brazil head coach, but the Italian was unable to lead his side to victory in a goalless draw with Ecuador last week. That result meant the five-time world champions failed to bounce back from March’s 4-1 thrashing by rivals Argentina, and they have now gone winless in back-to-back qualifiers for the third time in this campaign, having endured a four-game skid between October and November 2023 and drawn twice in November 2024. While not disastrous for Brazil’s bid to reach a 23rd World Cup, just one win from their last five qualifying matches is a growing concern. Despite collecting six wins from 15 games overall, the Selecao sit fourth and will hope to record a fifth qualifying win in Ancelotti’s first home match. Four of those victories have come on home soil, and with a four-game unbeaten run at home (three wins), Brazil will aim to extend that streak against Paraguay. Team News Casemiro impressed on his return to the national team and should keep his place in midfield. With no injuries reported, Ancelotti may rotate slightly, possibly introducing Antony and Matheus Cunha in place of Estevao Willian and Richarlison. Vinicius Junior, who has only one goal in qualifying – netted in a last-minute win over Colombia – will be eager to deliver a standout performance amid criticism of his international form. Paraguay Gustavo Julio Alfaro’s side climbed above Brazil in the standings after securing a 2-0 victory over Uruguay in the last round of qualifiers. That result extended Paraguay’s unbeaten streak to nine matches, a run that began in September 2024 and has included five wins, bringing them closer to a first World Cup appearance since South Africa 2010. With just three games left in the campaign, Paraguay sit on 24 points—two ahead of Brazil and six above seventh-placed Venezuela—occupying the Inter-confederation playoff spot. Given their six-point cushion, Los Guaranies could seal a place at the 2026 World Cup with a positive result in São Paulo, provided Venezuela fail to beat Uruguay. Team News Alfaro’s men appeared to come through the Uruguay clash without any injury concerns, meaning he should have a near-full squad available for Tuesday. While Antonio Sanabria, Paraguay’s joint-top scorer with four goals, did not net last time out, Julio Enciso struck a late penalty to seal the win, his third of the qualifiers, and will aim to continue his strong form against Brazil. Conclusion Even though Carlo Ancelotti’s appointment has been met with optimism in Brazil, the Selecao’s patchy form remains a concern. Despite going unbeaten in their last four home qualifiers, Brazil have struggled for consistency, and Paraguay’s resilience on the road – with four straight away draws – suggests Los Guaranies could frustrate the hosts again and come away with a valuable point in CONMEBOL qualifying.
