  "text": "Burnley kept a 12th consecutive clean sheet as they maintained the pressure on the Championship automatic promotion spots with a thumping 4-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday. The Owls were the better side in the first half, having more shots, but after they failed to test James Trafford, Marcus Edwards opened the scoring in the 43rd minute with the Clarets’ first shot on target. The floodgates then opened after the break. Substitute Josh Brownhill scored with his first touch just 48 seconds after his introduction, turning in Jaidon Anthony’s cross. Anthony then set up Connor Roberts for a tap-in to put the game beyond Wednesday, and Manuel Benson rounded off the scoring in style with a 95th-minute rocket. Burnley have now gone over 18 hours without conceding, with Scott Parker’s side boasting the best defensive record in England’s top four tiers. Having extended their unbeaten streak to 21 games, Burnley stay in the hunt for automatic promotion, sitting third, while Wednesday remain 10th. You know what time it is pic.twitter.com/bUhOoVrxWO — Burnley FC (@BurnleyOfficial) February 21, 2025 Elsewhere, Bristol City boosted their own hopes of promotion as they moved into the top six with a 2-1 comeback win over Middlesbrough. Tommy Conway had given Boro a first-half lead, pouncing on the rebound of Kelechi Iheanacho’s saved shot after Bristol City had wasted chances. However, Liam Manning’s triple change on the hour mark did wonders for the Robins. West Ham loanee George Earthy scored his first goal for the club, latching onto fellow substitute Cameron Pring’s cross. And his second Bristol City goal was not far behind as he completed the comeback, staying alert after Scott Twine’s free-kick cannoned off the post, turning it into the empty net. Bristol City move up to sixth, having recorded a sixth home win in seven games, while Boro’s misery continued as a fifth straight league defeat leaves them down in 11th.",
