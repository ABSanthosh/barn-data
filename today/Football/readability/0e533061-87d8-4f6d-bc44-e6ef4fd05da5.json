  "text": "Scott McTominay and Romelu Lukaku led Napoli’s charge as Antonio Conte’s team dispatched relegation-threatened Empoli 3-0 to close in on Inter in the Serie A title race. Inter beat Cagliari 3-1 on Saturday to extend their lead at the top to six points, but Napoli closed that gap back to three with a dominant victory on Monday. Napoli needed just 18 minutes to open the scoring as Lukaku battled free in midfield and play it to McTominay, whose low long-range shot bounced over Devis Vasquez’s outstretched hand and into the corner of the net. Lukaku turned from provider to scorer in the 56th minute when he latched onto a Mathias Olivera throughball and finished coolly. And the Belgian combined with McTominay again five minutes later, as the former Manchester United midfielder powered home a header from Lukaku’s cross. 12+10 – Romelu #Lukaku is one of the two players in the big-5 European Leagues 2024-25, alongside Mohamed Salah (27G+18A), to have reached the double figures for both goals and assists: 12 goals and 10 assists for the #Napoli striker. Precious.#NapoliEmpoli pic.twitter.com/arnMWYnnXD — OptaPaolo (@OptaPaolo) April 14, 2025 While Napoli push for the title, Empoli are staring down the barrel of relegation. They sit 19th, two points from safety with six games remaining. Data Debrief: Lukaku still elite Lukaku’s three goal contributions mean he became just the second player across Europe’s top five leagues this season to reach double figures for both goals and assists. He has now netted 12 times and teed up a further 10 goals. Mohamed Salah (27 goals and 18 assists in the Premier League) is the only other player who has reached double figures in both metrics this term. In fact, no player has managed to provide more than one assist in a single game in a top five European league this season on more occasions than Lukaku (three) – he is equal to Omar Marmoush, Son Heung-min and Salah in that regard. The 31-year-old, who celebrated his 100th Serie A victory, has now been involved in at least 20 goals in a league campaign for the first time since the 2020-21 season, when he starred for Inter.",
