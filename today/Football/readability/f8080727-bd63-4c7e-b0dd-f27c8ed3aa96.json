  "text": "Verdict: Goal to be scored in both halves Best Odds: 8/11 Bookmaker: Dachbet Two European giants who have already punched their respective Club Wold Cup knockout stage spots, Juventus and Manchester City will meet in Orlando on Thursday night. Juventus Starting with Juventus, while the Old Lady might have only welcomed Igor Tudor to Turin back in March, they are certainly enjoying life under the former Lazio boss. Getting their Club World Cup adventure underway on June 19th with a 5-0 romp against Al-Ain, the Bianconeri were last seen putting in another dominant display. Cruising their way to a 4-1 victory against Wydad, Juve have breezed their way to a knockout stage ticket and haven’t had to get out of second gear. Signing off the 2024/25 campaign with an action-packed 3-2 win away at Venezia, Tudor’s camp have now won their previous four appearances across all competitions by an aggregate score of 14-3. Likewise, with their sights set on mounting a genuine title charge this summer, the Old Lady have suffered just a sole defeat since returning from March’s international break. Juventus Team News All still dealing with respective long-term knee injuries, Juventus will once again be without the trio of Arkadiusz Milik, Juan Cabal and Brazilian defender Bremer. Coming off the bench and bagging a maiden Club World Cup strike last weekend, Dusan Vlahovic could be handed a full recall. Linked with a potential switch to Premier League outfit Nottingham Forest this summer, Timothy Weah should feature on Thursday night. Making his move to Turin a permanent one this summer, ex-Newcastle defender Lloyd Kelly could be handed a rest in Orlando. Manchester City As for Manchester City, eventually finishing the 2024/25 campaign without a single piece of silverware to show for their troubles, Pep Guardiola’s men have allot of pressure on their shoulders this summer. However, despite their FA Cup final heartbreak at Wembley on May 17th, the Sky Blues are enjoying what has been an extended flurry. Winning their first two Group G appearances by an aggregate score of 8-0, the former Barcelona boss will be calling on his squad to lay down a heavyweight marker on Thursday night. Dragging themselves to an essential Champions League ticket last month, Man City have suffered just a sole defeat from their previous 15 consecutive appearances across all competitions. Signing off the 2024/25 campaign with a 2-0 win away at Fulham, Guardiola’s side have also refound a clinical edge in the final third. Manchester City Team News Shown a straight red card against Wydad on June 18th, England international Rico Lewis will once again miss out through suspension in Orlando. Making his Manchester City debut against Al-Ain earlier in the week, former Wolves defender Rayan Ait Nouri will be hoping to keep his spot at left-back. Likewise, bagging a first goal for Guardiola’s side on Monday, new recruit Rayan Cherki should be handed a full recall here. Despite speculation over a summer move away from the Etihad, England ace John Stones could make a first Club World Cup appearance. Juventus vs Manchester City Key Factors to Consider When Juventus and Manchester City met for a Champions League group stage showdown back on December 11th, the Old Lady collected a 2-0 victory in Turin. In fact, Juventus have won all of their previous three meetings against the Sky Blues across all competitions. Juventus have won their previous four appearances across all competitions by an aggregate score of 14-3. Despite their FA Cup final heartbreak on May 17th, that is the only loss that Man City have suffered from their previous 15 appearances across all formats. Juventus and Manchester City have scored a combined tally of 17 goals in their opening two Group G appearances. Conclusion When Manchester City might open Thursday’s Group F finale pencilled in as a standout contender, Guardiola’s camp will be concerned by a nightmare record against the Old Lady. Hit with a 2-0 loss when they travelled to Turin for a Champions League group stage showdown on December 11th, they have lost all of their previous three consecutive meetings against Juventus by an aggregate score of 5-1. While both of the European giants might have already booked their respective knockout stage tickets, we could be treated to another Club World Cup thriller in Orlando. With Juventus and Man City bagging a combined tally of 17 goals in their first two Group F appearances, both camps will be confident of collecting a heavyweight scalp.
