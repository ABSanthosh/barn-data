  "text": "Leeds United manager Daniel Farke has revealed that Patrick Bamford is not part of his plans for next season. The striker was left out of Leeds’ squad in their 0-0 draw against rivals Manchester United for their pre-season friendly in Sweden. Bamford played just 17 matches in the Championship last season after struggling with a hamstring injury and failed to score in the league. Indeed, over the past two seasons, Bamford has managed just 15 league starts, scoring eight goals and featuring for only 1,719 minutes. Farke pointed to Bamford’s fitness struggles as a reason for his exclusion, but explained how an honest conversation between the pair helped the situation. “I had a really open and honest conversation with him. He knows exactly how I view him as a player,” said Farke. “I would have preferred a completely fit Patrick Bamford in the last two seasons. He also knows how much I rate him as a person and I thought it was my duty to have a very honest conversation with him straight away. “I think it was the second day of pre-season – I told him my plans for the upcoming Premier League season. Due to the fact he has had really difficult years, for me Patrick is a player who at this stage needs to be the main man. He needs the arm around the shoulder – if he gets this, he will score goals, he’s a top player. “But after the last two seasons I was not willing to say he is the main man at Premier League level. And then I do not think he should be a back-up option if he was the main man for so many years. It’s not the perfect situation. “He’s trained really good, really professionally. His reaction was top class, like I expected. He liked the honesty. Patrick has done so much for this club. He has won two types of promotion and deserves some respect and transparency. “He is aware that he is not part of my Premier League plans.” “It was a perfect first test for us” pic.twitter.com/BWLuYBdIXn — Leeds United (@LUFC) July 19, 2025 While Bamford was left out of Leeds’ trip to Sweden, Jack Harrison was included in the squad and started against United. Harrison spent the past two seasons on loan with Everton, registering four league goals and three assists in that time. The 28-year-old has not been universally welcomed back by Leeds fans, but Farke is willing to give Harrison a chance to earn back some trust. Farke said: “It all depends on how Jack uses his chances. He’s under contract. He knows the league inside out and has many Premier League appearances. “He had a brilliant first part of his time at Leeds United. Of course, it’s always a bit tricky if you’re then away a couple of years. He had an offer to stay at the top level. It was a decision before my time, but now he’s back with us. “He’s a great guy, a hard worker, pretty reliable and proven at Premier League level. It’s up to him to win the trust and confidence back.”",
