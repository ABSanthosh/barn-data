Northern Ireland were blown away in Tuesday’s friendly in Stockholm, with Newcastle United’s Alexander Isak and Nottingham Forest’s Anthony Elanga among the goals. Emil Holm, Benjamin Nygren and Ken Sema were also on target for Sweden, who have scored five or more goals in back-to-back home internationals for the first time since 1957, having beaten Azerbaijan 6-0 last time out on home soil. Northern Ireland, meanwhile, conceded more goals in Tuesday’s defeat than they had across their last eight internationals combined (four), since a 5-1 loss to Spain last June. Speaking after the game, O’Neill praised his players’ application and outlined his view that the final scoreline did not truly reflect the balance of play. “We obviously didn’t come here to have a scoreline like we had tonight, but we knew it would be a tough game,” said O’Neill. “In all honesty, the attitude of the team was great. They never stopped trying to play. It was a tough night but that’s why we took a game like this. “I think 5-1 is maybe a bit harsh on us but at the end of the day we did give them opportunities, and at this level they will punish you. “But we’re asking a lot of young players who aren’t playing every week for their clubs. They are not exposed to this level and this quality of player.” Sweden only just outshot Northern Ireland, having 16 attempts and facing 14, though their chances had a total value of 3.02 expected goals (xG) to Northern Ireland’s 1.06. The next international break sees Northern Ireland face another friendly against Scandinavian opposition in Iceland, ahead of World Cup qualifiers against Luxembourg and Germany in September. “You always learn in international football. Our team is made up of players who play in the Championship and League One,” O’Neill continued. “They were playing against players who play at the top level in the top leagues. “That’s the difference. The physicality and the speed was a challenge for us but it’s one we’re going to have to deal with. “There’s another level above this – we have to go and play Germany – so we know what’s in store but we can only get better if we expose ourselves to this level of opposition.”",
