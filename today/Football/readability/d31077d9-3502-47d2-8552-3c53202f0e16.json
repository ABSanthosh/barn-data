Ange Postecoglou’s sorry side were smashed 4-0 by Liverpool in Thursday’s EFL Cup semi-final second leg, while the Lions have had a week to reflect on their 2-0 loss to near neighbours Wolverhampton Wanderers. Aston Villa Aston Villa’s journey to the FA Cup fourth round saw them edge past West Ham with a 2-1 victory, thanks to late goals from Amadou Onana and Morgan Rogers overturning Lucas Paqueta’s opener. However, consistency has eluded Unai Emery’s side since that triumph, with only two wins in their last six outings across all competitions, and just one from their previous five. That lone bright spot, a 4-2 victory over Celtic, was pivotal in securing their spot in the Champions League last 16. Yet, Villa’s struggles to transition from European success to domestic grounds continue. Following their Champions League exploits, they fell flat at Molineux, succumbing to a 2-0 derby defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers, courtesy of goals from Jean-Ricner Bellegarde and Matheus Cunha. Despite their away day woes, Villa Park remains a fortress. The Lions are unbeaten in 10 consecutive home matches since their October EFL Cup exit to Crystal Palace. However, defensive frailties linger, with no clean sheets in their last six games on home turf. History against Tottenham doesn’t offer much comfort either. Villa have conceded four goals in each of their last two encounters with Spurs, losing both. Still, their clean sweep of meetings in 2023 will give Emery’s side confidence as they step into this FA Cup clash, fully aware they carry the favourites tag at Villa Park. Team News Emery has the option to call upon Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford, who did not feature for his parent club in the third round and is therefore eligible. However, lacking match continuity, it’s more likely for the England international to start this one on the bench and maybe make his Villa debut later in the match. Marco Asensio, who arrived on loan from Paris Saint-Germain, is in a similar situation. With Ollie Watkins sidelined through a groin problem, the attacking line could be led by Donyell Malen – yet another newcomer. Apart from Watkins, Pau Torres, Matty Cash, Tyrone Mings and Ross Barkley are injured as well, and Axel Disasi, having represented Chelsea in this competition this season, is cup-tied. Tottenham Hotspur Tottenham’s fragile hopes of silverware under Ange Postecoglou took another blow as their slender 1-0 first-leg advantage over Liverpool in the Carabao Cup semifinals was ruthlessly overturned at Anfield. Goals from Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah (from the penalty spot), Dominik Szoboszlai, and Virgil van Dijk sealed a comprehensive 4-0 victory for the Reds, dashing Spurs’ dreams of glory and marking another stumble in Postecoglou’s second-season aspirations. This latest defeat came on the heels of what many hoped was a turning point: a 2-0 London derby victory over Brentford that snapped a dire four-game losing streak in the Premier League. However, despite that brief resurgence, Spurs remain stranded outside the top half of the table, with their points tally still uncomfortably closer to the relegation zone than the European qualification spots. Adding to their recent frustrations, Tottenham’s FA Cup third-round clash against non-league Tamworth was far from convincing. While the 3-0 scoreline suggests a straightforward win, the reality was much grimmer, as Spurs were pushed to extra time by their plucky opponents, who had multiple chances to cause a historic upset in regular time. Nevertheless, results are what matter in knockout football, and Postecoglou’s side has secured their spot in the fourth round. Tottenham boast a decent record at this stage of the FA Cup, winning four of their last five fourth-round ties. However, that one blemish came in last year’s campaign, where they were eliminated by Manchester City – a stark reminder that tougher tests lie ahead. Team News Tottenham’s injury crisis deepened during the Liverpool loss, with Richarlison the latest to join a lengthy absentee list after suffering a calf injury that saw him withdrawn for new signing Mathys Tel before halftime. The Brazilian’s misfortune epitomizes Spurs’ current woes, as Postecoglou now finds himself without a full starting XI’s worth of key players. Guglielmo Vicario (ankle), Radu Dragusin (knee), Wilson Odobert (hamstring), Dominic Solanke (knee), James Maddison (calf), Micky van de Ven (fitness), Destiny Udogie (hamstring), Cristian Romero (thigh), Timo Werner (thigh), and Brennan Johnson (calf) have all been ruled out for Sunday’s FA Cup fourth-round clash against Aston Villa, leaving the North London side with a threadbare squad. With options dwindling, Postecoglou may be forced to shuffle his pack. Mathys Tel, on loan from Bayern Munich, is in line for his full debut, while Pedro Porro and Lucas Bergvall could provide some much-needed energy and dynamism. There’s also the possibility of Son Heung-min shifting into a more central role, potentially opening up space for young Mikey Moore to make a rare start. Conclusion Tottenham’s impressive track record at Villa Park – winning nine of their last 10 away games against Aston Villa – will offer little solace to a squad ravaged by injuries, fatigue, and a dented morale. Postecoglou’s men are limping into Sunday’s FA Cup fourth-round clash not just physically but mentally, following a brutal defeat to Liverpool and an ever-growing injury list that leaves them severely depleted. In stark contrast, Unai Emery’s Aston Villa have enjoyed a full week of rest, free from Champions League commitments, allowing them to regroup and refocus after their recent blip against Wolves. With home advantage and a nearly full-strength squad, the Lions are primed to exploit Spurs’ vulnerabilities. Verdict: Home win Best odds: 33/50 Bookmaker: ZetBet",
