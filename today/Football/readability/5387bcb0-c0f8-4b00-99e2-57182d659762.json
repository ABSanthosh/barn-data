Under the guidance of Julian Nagelsmann, Germany have already collected four points from their opening two games, putting them in a favorable position as they target the quarter-finals. In contrast, Bosnia-Herzegovina find themselves in third place and are still chasing their first win in this year’s competition. Despite a tough start, the hosts will hope to draw on their home advantage in Zenica as they look to upset the group leaders and climb the standings. Bosnia and Herzegovina Bosnia-Herzegovina’s turbulent history in the UEFA Nations League has seen them oscillate between League B and League A since the tournament’s inception, and they seem destined for another fierce relegation battle. With Hungary currently trailing only on goal difference, Sergej Barbarez’s men know that their third-place position could leave them facing a relegation/promotion play-off if they don’t improve. Bosnia’s Nations League campaign began with a tough 5-2 loss to the Netherlands, but they rebounded slightly with a 0-0 draw against Hungary. That stalemate snapped a painful seven-game losing streak across all competitions, which included their failure to qualify for Euro 2024 – a bitter blow for a nation still seeking its first appearance at the European Championships as an independent country, despite participating in the 2014 World Cup. One glimmer of hope for the Dragons is their recent home form in the Nations League, having won their last three matches on home soil. However, Bosnia have never beaten Germany in their current form, losing 3-1 in their last encounter back in 2010, when Bastian Schweinsteiger netted twice from the penalty spot. Team News Barbarez has been relatively fortunate on the injury front, with only one withdrawal in the form of uncapped midfielder Ifet Dakovac, meaning his absence won’t heavily impact the squad. The ever-reliable Edin Dzeko, at 38 years old, remains the talisman for his nation and continues to defy age with remarkable performances for Fenerbahce, scoring nine goals in 13 appearances across all competitions in the 2024/25 season. He is expected to lead the line alongside Stuttgart’s Ermedin Demirovic, offering Bosnia a potent attacking duo. Meanwhile, former Arsenal defender Sead Kolasinac will marshal the backline, bringing valuable experience and leadership as Bosnia aim to halt Germany’s progress in their Nations League clash. Germany Germany entered the UEFA Nations League with a clear sense of purpose following their disappointing quarterfinal exit at their home Euro 2024. Julian Nagelsmann’s side made a resounding statement by demolishing Hungary 5-0 in their first match, with five different players finding the back of the net. In their next fixture, they appeared to be on track to maintain a perfect start against the Netherlands after Joshua Kimmich and Denis Undav had overturned an early Dutch lead. However, Inter Milan’s Denzel Dumfries snatched a late equalizer to deny Germany a full three points, keeping them at the top of League A Group 3 on goal difference. Despite the draw, Germany’s defensive strength has kept them in control of their Nations League group, where even a second-place finish would still secure them a spot in the quarterfinals next March. However, they continue to struggle away from home, with only four victories in their last 13 matches on the road. Their Nations League away record is particularly concerning, with Die Mannschaft having only won one of their nine away fixtures in the competition, drawing their last four. Team News Nagelsmann faces several injury-related absences ahead of Friday’s UEFA Nations League clash against Bosnia-Herzegovina. Kai Havertz, managing a minor knee problem since the beginning of the season, is one of five notable players to withdraw from the squad. Joining Havertz on the sidelines are Jamal Musiala, David Raum, Benjamin Henrichs, and Robin Koch. In response, Nagelsmann has called up Robin Gosens and Kevin Schade, as well as uncapped players Jamie Leweling and Jonathan Burkardt, offering a mix of experience and youth. Additionally, Germany’s goalkeeping department will see at least one senior debut, as none of the three current options – Oliver Baumann, Alexander Nubel, and Janis Blaswich – have previously featured for the national team. This situation arises due to the absence of Manuel Neuer (retired from international duty) and Marc-Andre ter Stegen (recovering from a long-term knee injury). Conclusion Regardless of Germany coach Nagelsmann being without several important players for the trip to Bosnia, Die Mannschaft shouldn’t have too many problems in Zenica and they’re likely to return home with the three points in the bag. Verdict: Germany win to nil Best odds: 5/4 Bookmaker: Olympusbet",
