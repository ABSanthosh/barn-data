  "text": "Luis de la Fuente described Spain’s Nations League final against Portugal as a “blessing” as they prepare to face Cristiano Ronaldo at the Allianz Arena on Sunday. Spain booked their place in the showpiece match with an enthralling 5-4 victory over France on Thursday, as Barcelona wonderkid Lamine Yamal scored twice. De la Fuente’s team now turn their attention to achieving a third major trophy in three years, having won the Nations League in 2023 and the European Championships in 2024. But standing in their way are Portugal, who came from a goal down to beat Germany in the semi-finals, with Ronaldo scoring the winner after Florian Wirtz’s opener was cancelled out by Francisco Conceicao’s stunner. Indeed, Ronaldo netted his 137th international goal on Wednesday, and De la Fuente only had words of praise for Portugal’s 40-year-old stalwart. “It’s a blessing to face Portugal and a footballer who has shaped an era and a legacy,” De la Fuente said. “I often use Cristiano Ronaldo as an example for my players and to express my admiration for him. He is a role model for everyone, young and old.” Earlier on Saturday, Ronaldo confirmed he would not take part in the upcoming Club World Cup following the expiration of his contract with Al-Nassr, having been linked with a move to several participating clubs. This chapter is over. The story? Still being written. Grateful to all. pic.twitter.com/Vuvl5siEB3 — Cristiano Ronaldo (@Cristiano) May 26, 2025 De la Fuente also praised one of his own players, lauding Barcelona’s Pedri for his impressive displays for Hansi Flick’s side this season. Pedri netted his first-ever competitive goal for Spain in their 5-4 win over France, with that coming off the back of helping Barca to a domestic treble in 2024-25. The Spaniard featured in 59 of Barca’s 60 games across all competitions – the highest one-season total of his Blaugrana career – and the most of any player in Flick’s squad. In LaLiga, only Pau Cubarsi (2,426) completed more successful passes than Pedri (2,379) for Barca, further highlighting his significance to their success. Ahead of the showdown with Portugal, De la Fuente outlined how Pedri’s game has evolved, with the 22-year-old now a guaranteed starter for Spain. “Pedri has a special talent, as a number eight or as a number 10,” De la Fuente said. “I would like him to play closer to the opposition box as goals are scored nearer to the box. Key are the passes you make there, too. “He contributes a lot to us there. Because he can make those final passes, he completes patterns of play, and he’s improved a lot with his shooting.”",
