  "text": "Atlanta United midfielder Bartosz Slisz urged his team-mates to make sure their aggression from training is reflected in their performance against the Philadelphia Union. Atlanta have won just twice in MLS so far this season but are winless in their last two since beating New York City FC 4-3 at the end of March. It leaves them sitting 11th in the Eastern Conference, though a win on Saturday would see them close the gap to the teams above them. They lost 1-0 to New England Revolution last time out, failing to capitalise on their chances, and Slisz believes they are better than they showed in that match. “If you lose and you don’t [get frustrated], I think something is wrong with you,” Slisz said after training on Tuesday. “For sure, it’s not me, because I want to win every game. “Right now, the training session is very competitive. I know everyone wants to win. That’s why, in training, everyone wants to win, and we have to show it in the game. We have to be more aggressive.” Ready for the road #UniteAndConquer pic.twitter.com/mjXDJ4pjdm — Atlanta United FC (@ATLUTD) April 14, 2025 Meanwhile, Philadelphia Union are four points better off than their opponents as they sit fourth in the table. After a strong start to life under Bradley Carnell that saw them win four of their first five matches, they are now winless in three while failing to score in the last two. Carnell is not worried about their form in front of goal though, insisting they have still shown promise in the final third. “It wasn’t our best performance by far [in the 1-0 defeat to NYCFC], but it’s one we have to wipe away and move on from,” he said. “We’ve had enough there to get goals and get guys on the scoresheet, though it was different at NYCFC. We came close but weren’t as close as we have been. “We’ll keep on grinding and doing our thing. We’re still in a good way, and we’ll continue to push that and make sure everyone’s ready.” PLAYERS TO WATCH Philadelphia Union – Quinn Sullivan Philadelphia have been shut out in consecutive matches after finding the net at least once in their previous 14 league games. Quinn Sullivan had a game-high four shots (level with Bruno Damiani), with one of those hitting the target. He also had the most touches in the box (10), and was one of two Philadelphia players to have a ‘big’ chance. Atlanta United – Emmanuel Latte Lath Atlanta United failed to score in their defeat to New England despite recording 42 touches in the Revs’ box over the 90 minutes. Emmanuel Latte Lath had eight of those (a joint-team high along with Aleksey Mirankchuk), while also having six shots worth 1.08 expected goals (xG).

Atlanta’s lone win in eight visits to Subaru Park was a 2-0 victory in 2018 (D3 L4). The Union have managed just seven wins in their last 26 regular-season home matches dating back to mid-September 2023 (D10 L9). Prior to that, the Union had won six straight and registered 18 victories in their previous 21 league games at Subaru Park (D2 L1). Meanwhile, for the first time in club history, Atlanta United (nine points) have not reached double-figure points in their first eight games of a season. Atlanta’s 13 goals allowed are also their most at this stage of a season. OPTA WIN PROBABILITY Philadelphia Union – 52% Draw – 24.5% Atlanta United – 23.5%",
