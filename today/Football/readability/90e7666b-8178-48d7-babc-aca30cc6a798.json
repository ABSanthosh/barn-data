Caroline Graham Hansen’s first-half brace set them on their way to victory, netting both from inside the box after being teed up by Frida Maanum and Guro Reiten respectively. Tuva Hansen’s wonderful long-range strike was sandwiched between the two, and despite a spirited second half from the hosts, Guro Bergsvand profited from a scramble in the 67th minute to truly put them out of sight. Norway, who beat Albania 14-0 in the first round of qualifying, look set to continue their trend of qualifying for every European Championship since 1984, while Northern Ireland have a mountain to climb next week if they want to qualify for back-to-back tournaments. Belgium took a 2-0 lead into their second leg against Ukraine with a stoppage-time goal giving them a little more breathing space. Ella Van Kerkhoven headed the visitors in front after just 20 minutes, and they dominated as they pushed for a second to wrap the game up. Overall, they had 16 shots, hitting the back of the net again with their last attempt as Tessa Wullaert secured the victory in the 92nd minute, with Ukraine only mustering one attempt on target in return. Portugal, meanwhile, fought back from a goal down in front of a record crowd to clinch a 1-1 draw with Czechia. Katerina Svitkova gave Czechia the lead after 33 minutes, but Kika Nazareth struck just two minutes after the break to ensure they had a lifeline for their trip to Teplice on Tuesday. The results are in All to play for in the second legs #WEURO2025 pic.twitter.com/VAt4EqMJEw — UEFA Women’s EURO 2025 (@WEURO2025) November 29, 2024 Wales and the Republic of Ireland also played out a 1-1 draw in Cardiff to leave the tie in the balance. Lily Woodham scored with the hosts’ first shot, prodding home from close range, but fortune was in Ireland’s favour for the equaliser as Ruesha Littlejohn’s strike hit the crossbar before bouncing in off Olivia Clark’s head. Elsewhere, Poland hold a narrow advantage after the first leg thanks to their 1-0 victory over Austria. It was a tight affair, with Poland only managing one shot on target, but like Ireland, they profited from an own goal as Marina Georgieva turned it into her own net. And finally, Scotland played out a 0-0 draw with Finland at Easter Road as they look to reach their first major tournament under Pedro Martinez Losa. The Tartan Army were second-best on Friday though, with Linda Sallstrom’s lob forcing a good save out of Eartha Cumings, who kept Scotland’s nine-game unbeaten run intact.",
