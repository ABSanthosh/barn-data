  "text": "Philippe Clement praised Rangers’ dominant performance as they ran out 3-0 winners over Aberdeen on Wednesday. Clement has come under pressure in recent weeks after Rangers fell further behind leaders Celtic, but they have now secured back-to-back wins to move 13 points behind Brendan Rodgers’ side. Hamza Igamane got the ball rolling for the hosts early on, putting them ahead with a composed finish, his 13th goal for the club, on 13 minutes. Rangers continued to dominate, with Ianis Hagi striking the woodwork, but it took until second-half stoppage time to truly make sure of the points as they scored twice in four minutes. Substitute Leon Balogun, who had earlier struck the post, nodded in their second at the far post before setting up fellow replacement Cyriel Dessers to guide in the third in the 97th minute. It could easily have been more though, as Rangers had 29 shots, hitting the target with 12 of those, as they generated 3.43 expected goals (xG). “We had chances, a few good saves from the goalkeeper, and we hit the crossbar and post,” Clement told BBC Scotland. “But we kept pushing, as I demand, to score more and kill the belief of the opponent. “We played really well. We had domination with and without the ball, with everybody working hard for the team. “You see more and more people start to understand things, and we’re collectively better. “[Hamza Igamane] is doing really well, and we need to go on with this. He needs to do this all season, it’s hard to get to the top but harder to stay there. “I’m happy with the way Cyriel [Dessers] came in with a lot of energy and scoring a really good goal. That’s a plus and also the players coming back from injury.” Aberdeen, meanwhile, are currently on a 12-game winless streak as they continue to struggle to regain their early-season spark. They found it difficult to create chances, with Liam Kelly only needing to make two saves from their six attempts. Aberdeen also only managed 11 touches in the opposition box compared to Rangers’ 43, and manager Jimmy Thelin lamented their lack of composure. “You don’t want errors like that, but they happen. We have things to work on,” he told BBC Scotland. “Like how we play with the ball, we have to be more composed and find better rhythm in games. We had too many transitions against us, and they are good in transitions. “The fans’ expectations are higher. We are in a challenging time right now, a mix of everything, we are in a bad run, some injuries and new players. “We need to find the rhythm and stabilise as a team. Sometimes, when you don’t have the rhythm with the ball, the players run and fight for each other. They still tried with everything they had, but it costs a lot of energy when you give away the ball too many times. “The performances have to be better to deserve the points.”",
