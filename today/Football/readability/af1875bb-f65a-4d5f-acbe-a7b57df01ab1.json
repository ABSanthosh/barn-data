Philip Billing and Dango Ouattara scored a quickfire double within a five-minute spell in the second half before Daniel Adu-Adjei completed the scoring for the Cherries. Everton had the better chances of the first half, with Carlos Alcaraz and Beto both forcing Djordje Petrovic into good saves, but neither side could find a breakthrough. However, nine minutes into the second period, Billing broke the deadlock with a powerful strike from the edge of the box after combining well with Hamed Traore. Ouattara then doubled the Cherries’ lead four minutes later as he lashed the ball past Jordan Pickford at the near post following a poor touch from Nathan Patterson. Substitute Adu-Adjei then pounced on a poor back pass from Jake O’Brien, beating Pickford to the ball and poking it through the goalkeeper’s legs. Andoni Iraola’s side will face Manchester United next in their pre-season tournament, while David Moyes will come up against his former side in West Ham. Our Summer Series campaign starts in superb fashion pic.twitter.com/qruTLlsZLi — AFC Bournemouth (@afcbournemouth) July 26, 2025 Data Debrief: Iraola sets defensive foundation Following Dean Huijsen’s move to Real Madrid this summer, centre-backs Marcos Senesi and James Hill looked comfortable with a strong performance against Everton. Hill (nine) won the most aerial duels on the pitch, completed the most clearances (15), and had the most touches in the match (89). Meanwhile, Senesi (62) completed the most passes on the pitch and had the joint-most interceptions (two) along with Hill.",
