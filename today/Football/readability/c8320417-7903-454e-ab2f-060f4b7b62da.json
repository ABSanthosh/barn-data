The first leg of the playoff round tie between the Dutch Eredivisie club and the Serie A outfit will be held at Stadion Feijenoord and is scheduled to kick off at 8pm UK time on Wednesday. Feyenoord Feyenoord are one of the biggest clubs in the Netherlands who regularly challenge for the Eredivisie title and compete in Europe’s major club competitions, including the UEFA Champions League. De club aan de Maas finished as high as second in the Eredivisie title last season and were hoping for something similar this time around. However, things have not been great for Feyenoord on the domestic front. Brian Priske’s side are fifth in the Eredivisie table at the moment with 39 points from 21 matches. They are three points behind third-placed Utrecht, who have played 22 games, and are 12 points behind Ajax and PSV, who are first and second respectively in the standings. Feyenoord had a disappointing UEFA Champions League League Stage campaign. The Dutch club could pick up 13 points from eight games and finished 19th, three points behind eight-placed Aston Villa. Feyenoord will head into the UEFA Champions League game against AC Milan on the back of a 3-0 victory over Sparta Rotterdam at Stadion Feijenoord in the Eredivisie. It came after a 2-0 defeat at the hands of PSV Eindhoven away from home in the Dutch KNVB Beker which followed a 2-1 loss at the hands of Ajax on the road in the Eredivisie. Team News: Feyenoord are likely to line up in a 4-3-3 formation against AC Milan. Timon Wellenreuther will be in goal for the Dutch club and will have Bart Neiuwkoop, Thomas Beelen, David Hancko and Quilindschy Hartman in front of him in defence. Jakub Moder, Hwang In-Beom and Quinten Timber will be the three midfielders. Anis Hadj Moussa, Julian Carranza and Igor Paixao will be the three forwards. AC Milan AC Milan are one of the biggest clubs in the world and have a storied history. After going through a period of doom and gloom, the Rossoneri are back to being a force again in Italy and have also started to make themselves heard in Europe. The Rossoneri finished second in Serie A last season, but Sérgio Conceição’s side are not enjoying the same success this time around. Milan are seventh in the Serie A table at the moment with 38 points from 23 matches, seven points behind fourth-placed Lazio. The Italian club did not finish in the top eight of the League Stage table in the UEFA Champions League. Milan ended up 13th with 15 points from eight matches, just a point behind eight-placed Aston Villa. Milan will head into the UEFA Champions League game against Feyenoord on the back of a 2-0 victory over Empoli away from home in Serie A. It came after a 3-1 victory over AS Roma at San Siro in Serie A which followed a 1-1 draw with Inter Milan in Milan in the Derby della Madonnina. Team News: AC Milan are likely to line up in a 4-2-3-1 formation against Feyenoord. Mike Maignan will be in goal for the Rossoneri and will have Kyle Walker, Fikayo Tomori, Strahinja Pavlovic and Theo Hernandez in front of him in defence. Youssouf Fofana and Tijjani Reijnders will be the two holding midfielders. Yunus Musah, Joao Felix and Alex Jimenez will be the three attacking midfielders. Tammy Abraham will lead the line for Milan. Key Factors to Consider Feyenoord have won 2 of their last 3 UEFA Champions League games. Feyenoord have scored 18 goals and conceded 21 goals in 8 UEFA Champions League games. Tijjani Reijnders has scored 7 goals in 22 matches for AC Milan so far this campaign. AC Milan conceded 11 goals in 8 UEFA Champions League matches this season. AC Milan scored 14 goals in 8 UEFA Champions League matches this season. Conclusion Both Feyenoord and AC Milan have good teams, and the UEFA Champions League game between these two clubs this week promises to be an intriguing affair. It will be a tight match and is likely to end up in a draw. Prediction: Match to end in 1-1 draw Best Odds: 5/1 Bookmaker: Zetbet",
