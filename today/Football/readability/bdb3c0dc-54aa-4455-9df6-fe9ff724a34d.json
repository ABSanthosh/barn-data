  "text": "Competition: League One Market: Wrexham draw no bet Odds: 4/5 @ BetUS Looking to climb to the top of the League One table on Tuesday night, Wrexham will welcome Huddersfield to the Racecourse Ground. Starting with the hosts, while Wrexham might have only made their League One return this season, Phil Parkinson’s men are in the midst of what has become a public fairytale. Only continuing to shine since getting the new campaign underway, the Dragons remarkably find themselves pencilled in as a leading promotion contender once again this year. With the mood around the Racecourse Ground at a famous high, they now sit within striking distance of climbing to the top of the League One standings. Although the former Bolton boss might have seen his squad open October with a 1-0 loss at the hands of Stevenage, Wrexham have come roaring back in some style. Last seen over the weekend putting in another rugged display as they clinched a 1-0 victory away at Rotherham, Tuesday’s hosts have won each of their previous four appearances across all competitions by an aggregate score of 8-1. Likewise, gaining a fearsome reputation for their success on home soil, Parkinson’s high-flying squad have won all of their first six competitive showdowns at the Racecourse Ground so far this season. As for the visitors, after losing their Championship status last season, Huddersfield have their sights firmly set on clinching an immediate second-tier return. Much like Tuesday’s opponents, Michael Duff’s side have turned a much-welcomed corner over the past fortnight. Last seen over the weekend clinching a 3-1 victory at home against Bristol Rovers, the Yorkshire-based outfit have won each of their previous three appearances across all competitions. However, although the Terriers might be pencilled in as a leading play-off contender this year, the former Cheltenham boss will have a mounting headache over his side’s extended issues on the road. Last seen on their travels falling to a 1-0 defeat against title hopefuls Birmingham, Huddersfield have remarkably lost five of their previous six showdowns away from the John Smith’s Stadium across all competitions. Crashing out of the EFL Cup on August 27th following an action-packed 3-2 defeat at the hands of League Two outfit Walsall, Duff’s side should be bracing themselves for another stern challenge here.
