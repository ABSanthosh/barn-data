  "text": "Simone Inzaghi urged his Inter players to regain their focus after they dropped points in the Serie A title race following a 1-0 loss to Bologna on Sunday. Bologna substitute Riccardo Orsolini netted the winner in the fourth minute of second-half stoppage time, compounding Inter to just a fourth league defeat of the season. The result saw Bologna beat Inter for the first time in Serie A since February 2023, with their victory celebrated over in Naples as the title race begins to heat up. Inter are now level on points with second-placed Napoli, with Antonio Conte’s side emerging 1-0 victors over Monza on Saturday to keep their Scudetto ambitions intact. “It was a balanced match, with the goalkeepers intervening little,” Inzaghi told the reporters. “We played an organised match, with great sacrifice. In the second half, we could have developed some occasions better, and then the final episode penalised us. “However, we must not think that this defeat could affect our path.” Inter, one of eight teams who have won a league, cup and Champions League treble, could repeat the feat this season. “I’m happy with the performance because I thought that against a team like Bologna we could have risked suffering more,” Inzaghi added. “I’m disappointed with the result, but Bologna is a team of absolute value.” Full Time. #ForzaInter #BolognaInter pic.twitter.com/mTxzRdMLKr — Inter (@Inter_en) April 20, 2025 Inter’s cause was not helped by the absence of top scorer Marcus Thuram, with the forward joining Piotr Zielinski and Denzel Dumfries on the sidelines earlier this week. “We certainly missed (Dumfries and Thuram), but we are used to it because it is a period in which we never manage to be at full strength,” Inzaghi said. “Tonight, however, we must analyse the defeat, leaving aside the nervousness. “The team was very disappointed and nervous now, so we will do it later but our championship does not end here.” Thuram, who has scored 14 goals in Serie A for Inter this season, missed Sunday’s defeat with a thigh injury. The Frenchman is also a doubt for Wednesday’s Coppa Italia semi-final second leg against rivals AC Milan, with the tie finely poised at 1-1.",
