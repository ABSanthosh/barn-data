  "text": "Extending on their stellar start to the new campaign, Nottingham Forest collected a 1-0 victory against Crystal Palace on Monday night. While Eberechi Eze and Eddie Nketiah might have rattled the woodwork, it was the red-hot Chris Wood who proved to be Forest’s hero at the City Ground as his effort squirmed under England international Dean Henderson. Although Palace might have created a handful of chances here, the Eagles have still failed to collect a single victory from any of their first eight Premier League appearances and they now find themselves under increasing scrutiny. Putting in another gritty performance on Monday night, Nottingham Forest have cemented their spot as one of the Premier League’s surprise packages so far this season and have suffered just a single top-flight defeat so far. While Nuno Espírito Santo might have been forced to watch his side pick up a maiden victory at the City Ground from the stands, Forest now find themselves flirting with the European spots. Two sides who find the moods in their respective camps at polar opposites, we have taken a look at the key talking points from Monday’s showdown. Forest extend on their remarkable start While Nottingham Forest might have spent large spells of last season looking over their shoulder at a looming relegation scrap, Monday’s hosts have certainly made a string of improvements this time around. Springing what was an almighty upset away at title contenders Liverpool on September 14th as they left Anfield with a 1-0 victory, the former Wolves boss has seen his squad suffer just a single defeat from any of their first 10 Premier League appearances. Heading into October’s international break with a gritty 1-1 stalemate away at Champions League hopefuls Chelsea, Santo’s side now find themselves sat with just their goal difference keeping them outside of the European spots. Gaining a reputation for their rugged performances at the back, Nottingham Forest are certainly enjoying life under the Portuguese tactician and a top-half finish should be at the top of the agenda this season. Overcoming what have been some real challenges so far this season and currently holding the second-best defensive tally among England’s elite, Forest will be next seen on Friday night when they travel to Premier League returners Leicester. The pressure mounts on Glasner’s shoulders While Crystal Palace might have signed off last season in the midst of a remarkable purple patch, the Eagles have drastically struggled to find a similar level since opening up the new campaign. Watching attacking talisman Michael Olise and Danish defender Joachim Anderson complete respective moves away from Selhurst Park over the summer, it appears that the pressure on Oliver Glasner’s shoulders will soon reach a boiling point. Although Monday’s guests might have embarked on a sensational immediate rise following Glasner’s arrival in south London back in February, they have come crashing back down to earth in a worrying fashion. Opening proceedings with a 2-1 loss at the hands of London rivals Brentford on August 18th, the Eagles have remarkably failed to collect a single victory from any of their first eight Premier League appearances this season. Still sat in the relegation zone and desperately seeking a crucial boost, Palace face another stern challenge this weekend when they welcome Tottenham across the capital. Wood continues on his Premier League romp While there might have been plenty of speculation over the summer that Nottingham Forest were looking to bring in a new striking option, Wood has continued to underline his status as Santo’s leading man. Heading into October’s international break with a goal away at Chelsea, the former Nottingham Forest boss has certainly found a home at the City Ground and has hit the ground running this season. Bagging the winner on Monday night after his effort found a way past Henderson, the 32-year-old has already recorded five Premier League strikes this year and only the trio of Bryan Mbeumo, Cole Palmer and Erling Haaland have registered more top-flight goals. Likewise, finding the net in back-to-back appearances while away with New Zealand over the past fortnight, Wood has a leading role to play in Forest’s charge to claim a top-half finish this season. Now recording 19 Premier League goals in just his 39 appearances for Santo’s side, Wood has certainly repaid the £15million fee that Forest paid Newcastle last year.
