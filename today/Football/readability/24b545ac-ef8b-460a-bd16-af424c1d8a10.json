The Blues are still yet to lose a game in all competitions this season, extending their unbeaten streak to 22 matches as they set up a trip to Pride Park next month. West Ham were undone by two goals in nine first-half minutes from Johanna Rytting Kaneryd and Sjoeke Nusken. Rytting Kaneryd opened the scoring after 20 minutes at Kingsmeadow, squeezing the ball past Kinga Szemik and into the near post from a tight angle on the right of the box. Eva Nystrom then lost possession just outside her own box, with Nusken pouncing on the loose ball before rounding Szemik to slot it into the empty net. The Blues comfortably saw out the victory in the second half, dominating possession and limiting West Ham, who have never reached the League Cup final, to few clear-cut chances. “I’m really pleased with the win, and now we are on our way to the final,” Bompastor said. “It’s always important in the semi-final to win, and it’s never easy. “West Ham came with a different mindset from the last game [a 5-0 Chelsea win in the Women’s Super League in January]. We were playing at home tonight, and we had a good first half in terms of performance. “We were leading 2-0 at half-time, and I think it was good enough. We created some chances. We were clinical. That’s good when you’re able to be efficient in the box. “When you are not able to be efficient or to be clinical, the opponents have hope and then after that, it is a different game. To play against a block that is compact and low – they start with a back five, but we were able to score – it makes a big difference.” SUBWAY WOMEN’S LEAGUE CUP FINALISTS!!!! pic.twitter.com/zciNDomkmA — Chelsea FC Women (@ChelseaFCW) February 5, 2025 Chelsea have featured in every League Cup final since 2019-20, but have lost each of the last three they have played in, with a first trophy for Bompastor on the line this time around. They will face either Arsenal, who have beaten them in the past two finals in the competition, or Manchester City, with the two sides facing off on Thursday. Chelsea still have a chance to win the quadruple this season. They hold a seven-point advantage at the top of the Women’s Super League, while they progressed through their Champions League group with a 100% record. The Blues will face Everton in the Women’s FA Cup fourth round on Sunday as they attempt to keep fighting on all four fronts, but Bompastor insists she is not thinking about trophies at this stage of the season, despite just reaching a final. “I never think like this [of winning the quadruple],” she added. “I’m more focused on the next game on Sunday. It’s another cup game, but we’re really happy to get to this final, but if you don’t win, it doesn’t mean anything. “For me, now the focus is making sure we go deep in every competition. We go game by game and have a focus on the next game, and how we can make sure we have big chances to win.”",
