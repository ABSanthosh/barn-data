The league aim to raise the money by publicising a campaign during match broadcasts this weekend and through their social media accounts. After the Spanish FA postponed seven midweek Cup ties and all games scheduled for Valencia’s eastern region this weekend, it asked competition organisers to observe a minute’s silence before matches that will be played as a tribute to the victims. “Spain’s professional football joins the condolences and expresses its solidarity with the families of the victims and the missing,” LaLiga said in a statement on Thursday. Real Madrid announced they would also collaborate with the Red Cross and donate one million euros ($1.09 million). “The Real Madrid Foundation and the Red Cross have today launched a fundraising campaign to support those affected by the storm and the club have decided to support this campaign with a donation of one million euros to help the many families who are in a critical situation and need all our help and solidarity,” the Spanish champions said in a statement. El Real Madrid dona un millón de euros para ayudar a las víctimas de la DANA.#RealMadrid — Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadrid) October 31, 2024 Six postponed Copa del Rey games have been rescheduled for next week, leaving Real Sociedad’s match against Jove Espanyol in Alicante as the only tie without a new fixture date. LaLiga asked the 10 affected clubs in the top two divisions to submit a proposal for new dates before next Tuesday. Saturday’s LaLiga match between Valencia and visitors Real Madrid plus Villarreal’s clash with Rayo Vallecano are among the games postponed, as Valencia made the Mestalla stadium available as a drop-off point for donations of food and essential items.",
