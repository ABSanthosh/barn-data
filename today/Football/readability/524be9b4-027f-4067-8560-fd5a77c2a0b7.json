Real Madrid’s 3-2 victory over Twente earlier on Wednesday meant Chelsea only needed to draw at Stamford Bridge to ensure progression from Group B. However, goals from Lucy Bronze, Wieke Kaptein and Eve Perisset helped the Blues to their 11th victory in as many matches under former Lyon boss Bompastor. Just 65 seconds had passed when Bronze hammered a volley home from Catarina Macario’s corner, as Chelsea looked to enjoy a more comfortable outing after being forced to come from behind to win 2-1 at Celtic Park last week. Another corner led to Chelsea’s second goal in the 25th minute as Guro Reiten swung a wonderful ball in for Kaptein to glance home. The Blues dominated the rest of the way and racked up 25 shots to Celtic’s three, and they added a third deep into stoppage time when substitute Perisset converted from 12 yards following Shannon McGregor’s handball. Bompastor’s former club Lyon also clinched their spot in the knockout stages as four late goals saw them beat Roma 4-1 and seal qualification from Group A. They trailed as late as the 77th minute through a goal from Roma substitute Giulia Dragoni, but two goals in less than two minutes Kadidiatou Diani turned the game on its head. Substitute Eugenie Le Sommer added a third before Wendie Renard managed a fourth in stoppage time, with Lyon’s superior head-to-head record ensuring they can no longer be overtaken by the Giallorosse.",
