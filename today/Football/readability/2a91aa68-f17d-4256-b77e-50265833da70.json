  "text": "Competition: Brazil Serie A Market: Over 1.5 goals Odds: 2/5 @ BetUS Looking to make an immediate return to winning ways on Wednesday night, Vitoria will travel to the Heriberto Hulse when they meet Criciuma. Starting with the hosts, although Criciuma might have only made their Serie A return this season, Claudio Tencati’s men have a real battle on their hands in the race to keep hold of their top flight status. Opening up the midweek fixtures with just their goal difference keeping them outside the drop zone, the Tigers are desperately seeking some kind of boost on Wednesday night. Slumping to a 2-1 loss when they travelled to Cruzeiro prior to November’s international break, the former Londrina boss finds his squad in the match of a four-match winless rut. Opening November with a routine 2-0 defeat at the hands of Internacional, Criciuma have also shown some extended issues at the back. Including a woeful 5-0 drumming away at Palmeiras on September 15th, the midweek hosts have put just a pair of Serie A clean sheets on the board from any of their last 10 consecutive outings. As for the visitors, while Vitoria might have entered November’s international break with a 2-1 loss at home against Corinthians, Thiago Carpini’s men have gained plenty of plaudits since making their respective Serie A return this season. Signing off October with a stellar 2-1 win against Fluminense, the Bahia-based outfit have registered nine points from their previous four showdowns against top flight opposition. Sat in the driving seat to book a shock Copa Sudamericana ticket this year, Wednesday’s guests should also be excited by their rugged success on the road. Including a 2-0 victory away at Atletico GO on September 14th, Vitoria have lost just one of their previous four appearances away from Barradao. Likewise, landing a 2-1 win when they welcomed Criciuma to town for their reverse Serie A battle on July 7th, Carpini will be seeking a repeat performance here. With Vitoria seeing all of their last 10 straight away fixtures finish with over 1.5 goals, we are expecting a similar outcome. Bet: Over 1.5 goals at Criciuma vs Vitoria  2/5 for Wednesday’s Brazil Serie A showdown @ BetUS",
