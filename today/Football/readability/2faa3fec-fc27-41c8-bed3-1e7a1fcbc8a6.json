  "text": "Verdict: Bournemouth draw no bet Best Odds: 3/5 Bookmaker: Dachbet Looking to extend on their shock European charge, Bournemouth will travel to Portman Road on Sunday afternoon when they meet Ipswich. Ipswich Starting with the hosts, while Ipswich might have entered November’s international break with a famous 2-1 victory away at Tottenham, Kieran McKenna’s men have failed to use that performance as a platform to build on. Falling short in what was a real relegation six-point earlier on Tuesday night as they fell to a 1-0 loss at home against Crystal Palace, the Blues appear to have a real battle on their hands this season. Battling it out at the heart of a Premier League relegation scrap, the former Manchester United coach has seen his squad muster just a single win from any of their first 14 top-flight appearances. Signing off November with another 1-0 defeat against Nottingham Forest, Ipswich are facing the threat of getting cut adrift. Still waiting to put a maiden Premier League victory on the board at Portman Road, McKenna’s squad should face another tricky test here. Ipswich Team News Not making a single appearance since the end of October and still dealing with a recent muscle issue, Ipswich are once again expected to be without summer recruit Chiedozie Ogbene. Likewise, former Manchester United youngster Axel Tyanzebe remains a doubt. Already notching six Premier League strikes and reportedly attracting plenty of heavyweight interest, Liam Delap will lead Ipswich’s charge. Struggling to find any kind of stability since arriving on a season-long loan switch from Manchester City, Kalvin Phillips will be hoping to get some minuets. Bournemouth As for the visitors, putting in a dominant display earlier in the week as they collected a deserved 1-0 victory against Tottenham, Bournemouth have continued to receive plenty of plaudits this season. Clearly enjoying life under Andoni Iraola’s guidance, the Cherries are remarkably sat within touching distance of finding a route into the European spots. Signing off November with an action-packed 4-2 win away at Wolves, the former Rayo Vallecano boss finds the mood in his camp at a real high. Losing just a pair of their previous seven Premier League appearances, Sunday’s guests will be looking to extend on their recent flurry here. Collecting back-to-back wins for the first time this season and already claiming some heavyweight scalps, the Cherries should be relishing a trip to Portman Road this weekend. Bournemouth Team News Suffering a knee injury back in October, former Bristol City starlet Alex Scott remains on the sidelines and will not feature here. Once again missing out against Tottenham earlier in the week, summer recruit and ex-Barcelona defender Julian Araujo is still a doubt. Already notching four Premier League goals since completing a record-breaking move from Porto, Brazilian striker Evanilson will lead the line. Enjoying what has become a real breakout campaign at the Vitality, Dean Huijsen will partner Ilya Zabarnyi at the heart of Iraola’s defence.  Ipswich vs Bournemouth Key Factors to Consider Sunday’s showdown at Portman Road will be the first time that Ipswich and Bournemouth have met since a 1-1 draw back in April 2015. The Cherries have collected back-to-back Premier League victories for the first time this season. Ipswich have recorded just a single victory from any of their first 14 Premier League appearances. Along with failing to collect a maiden win at Portman Road so far this season, Ipswich have claimed just a single victory in Suffolk since the start of April. Bournemouth’s last three appearances away from the Vitality have produced 13 goals at both ends of the pitch. Conclusion Collecting another heavyweight scalp earlier in the week as they claimed a deserved 1-0 victory against Tottenham, Bournemouth will be relishing a trip to Suffolk here. Claiming back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time this season, the Cherries are sat within touching distance of breaking into the European spots. Continuing to receive a string of plaudits, Bournemouth should be looking to cash in on an Ipswich squad that have put just a single Premier League victory on the board. Verdict: Bournemouth draw no bet Best Odds: 3/5 Bookmaker: Dachbet",
