  "text": "Claiming a much-welcomed boost on Sunday afternoon, Arsenal drew a line under their five-match winless rut as they secured a 1-0 victory against Newcastle in north London. Struggling to find any kind of stability throughout the first-half, Mikel Arteta’s camp were fortunate to have not been chasing a deficit as Newcastle wasted a handful of golden opportunities in the opening 20 minutes. However, it was Declan Rice who proved to be Arsenal’s hero at the Emirates as the England international produced a superb strike 10 minutes after the restart. With Rice’s fourth Premier League goal of the season certainly easing the tense mood, Arsenal ended their home campaign with a first victory from over the past month. As for Newcastle, ruing what was regarded as a potential opportunity here, the Magpies head into their final showdown of the season holding just a one-point buffer from dropping out of the Champions League spots. On an afternoon when Arsenal officially clinched a Premier League silver medal finish, we have taken a look at the main talking points from north London. Arsenal claim a welcomed boost Watching their Champions League adventure come to an end on May 7th as they fell to a 3-1 aggregate defeats against French giants PSG, Arsenal have already accepted that they will end the 2024/25 campaign without a single piece of silverware to show for their troubles. Opening Sunday’s penultimate Premier League showdown here having failed to win any of their previous five appearances across all competitions, Arteta’s side had come under a tremendous amount of scrutiny. However, although large sections of the Emirates support might have been left frustrated over the past month, the Gunners did officially clinch a silver medal finish. Overcoming what was a real challenge on Sunday afternoon and recording a first Premier League victory since a 4-0 romp against Ipswich on April 20th, Arsenal will know that stability is key next season. Not getting their hands on a Premier League title since way back in 2006, Arteta will know that another campaign without a piece of silverware will not be tolerated next season. Newcastle’s Champions League dreams are going down to the wire Missing out on the chance to leapfrog Arsenal and move into silver medal position here, Newcastle’s race to book a famous Champions League return will be going down to the wire. Clinching an eye-catching 2-0 victory at home against Chelsea last week, Eddie Howe’s men travelled to the capital on Sunday afternoon smelling the chance to collect another heavyweight scalp. Despite making real history back in March as they ended their 70-year wait for a piece of silverware thanks to a 2-1 EFL Cup victory against Liverpool at Wembley, Newcastle have now won just a pair of their previous five Premier League appearances. Heading into their final showdown of the season holding just a one-point buffer from slipping out of the Champions League spots, Sunday’s guests have a huge amount of pressure on their shoulders. Welcoming Everton to St. James’ Park next weekend, the former Bournemouth boss will already be planning for what is a monumental battle. A new number nine will be at the top of Arteta’s wishlist Once again opting against brining in attacking reinforcements during the January transfer window, many feel that decision has been a major nail in Arsenal’s Premier League title charge. Only notching more than a single strike in just one of their previous five appearances across all fronts, no player in north London has reached double digits in the Premier League this season. With the Emirates hierarchy making it clear in the build-up to Sunday’s matchup that Arteta will be substantially backed this summer, Arsenal certainly have a new number nine at the top of their agenda. Unable to call upon a natural striker over the past few months and with Mikel Merino often deployed in a false nine role, the Gunners know that a marque arrival would certainly offer the north London support a real boost.
