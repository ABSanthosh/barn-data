Dinamo Minsk Starting with Dinamo Minsk, falling to a first-leg 1-0 loss when they travelled to Razgard last week, Vadim Skripchenko’s men have an almighty job on their hands here. Forced to play their European qualifying fixtures away from the Dinamo Stadium, they also find themselves in the midst of what has been a recent rut. Despite claiming consecutive domestic titles last season, the Whites do have the feel of a squad seeking a much-welcomed boost. Getting July underway with a 2-0 loss against ML Vitebsk, Minsk have now lost four of their previous five appearances across all competitions. Despite landing a 5-0 romp against Dynamo Brest last month, the Belarusian champions have failed to find any kind of fluidity in the final third. Along with drawing back-to-back blanks since opening July, Skripchenko’s side have also failed to record more than a single strike in seven of their previous eight outings. Dinamo Minsk Team News Forced to settle for a spot on the bench in Razgard last week, Brazilian youngster Pedro Igor could be handed a recall and spearhead Minsk’s charge. Notching just a single strike since arriving ahead of the 2025 campaign, Susan Bakic could be dropped to the bench. Completing a permanent switch from domestic rivals Zhodino earlier in the year, Belarusian international Maksim Myakish will partner Vladislav Kalinin in the middle of the park. Ludogorets As for Ludogorets, picking up what was a deserved first-leg advantage on home soil last week, the Eagles will simply be looking to avoid what would be considered a major collapse. However, despite breezing their way to record-breaking 14th consecutive domestic crown last season, Rui Mota’s men endured some real summer frustration. Signing off their pre-season preparations with a downbeat 2-0 loss against Czech-based outfit Hradec Kralove, the Bulgarian heavyweights will also know the importance of finding a clinical edge in the final third. Extending on from their summer preparations, Ludogorets’ first-leg winner last week is the only goal that they have registered in their previous three outings. Nevertheless, holding a slender advantage when they travel over to Hungary in midweek, Mota’s side will be confident of finishing off the job and extending on their qualifying adventure. Ludogorets Team News Limping off with a first-leg knock last week, Ludogorets are expected to be without former Olympiacos youngster Aguibou Camara on Wednesday night. Making an immediate return in Razgard, Dutch shot-stopper Sergio Padt will keep his spot between the sticks. Bagging that first-leg winner last week, Czech Republic international Filip Kaloc will start in the middle of the park. Completing a permanent switch from Brazilian outfit Vasco ahead of the 2025 campaign, 21-year-old Erick Marcus will lead the line here. Dinamo Minsk vs Ludogorets Key Factors to Consider When Wednesday’s opponents met for their first-leg showdown last week, Ludogorets collected a 1-0 victory on home soil. Dinamo Minsk have now lost four of their previous five appearances across all competitions. The Whites have also failed to record more than a single strike in seven of their previous eight outings. Continuing on from their summer preparations, Ludogorets have registered just a single goal in their last three outings. Each of the three competitive meetings between Dinamo Minsk and Ludogorets have finished with under 2.5 goals. Conclusion While Ludogorets might only hold a one-goal advantage ahead of their trip to Hungary in midweek, the Bulgarian giants are sat in the driving seat. Landing a first-leg 1-0 victory last week, the Eagles will be confident of extending on their Champions League qualifying adventure here. With Minsk now lost four of their previous five appearances across all competitions and showing some real issues in the final third, Skripchenko’s side should be bracing themselves for another stern examination away from the Dinamo Stadium. Verdict: Ludogorets win  Best Odds: 7/10 Bookmaker: Dachbet",
