  "text": "Jacob Murphy is dreaming of winning more silverware with Newcastle United, but said his team-mates must keep the pressure on in the race for Champions League football. Murphy was part of the team that ended Newcastle’s 70-year wait for a trophy after they beat Liverpool in the EFL Cup final at Wembley last month. And Eddie Howe’s side have continued their fine form since that day, earning a fourth victory in their last five Premier League games at the King Power Stadium. Murphy scored twice in the opening 11 minutes to put the visitors in control before former Leicester man Harvey Barnes sealed the victory before the break. Indeed, 14 of Murphy’s 16 Premier League goal involvements for Newcastle this season have come since the start of December (seven goals, seven assists). In that time, only Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah (28) and Newcastle team-mate Alexander Isak (19) have more in that time. And while Murphy took the time to reflect on Newcastle’s trophy celebrations from their EFL Cup win, he said the focus has been shifted to finishing in the Champions League places. “You can see why the greats get addicted to winning trophies,” Murphy said. “It’s been unbelievable. The bus tour was out of this world… “We want to keep striving for better and taste it again. “It’s hugely important for us. We can see other English teams doing really well. We had a taste of it last season. We’ve got eight games to go now, no other distractions. “I think we can really put a challenge up to the teams around us, one game it can all change so we need to keep the pressure on.” ANOTHER ONE pic.twitter.com/5L6wl9qWr5 — Newcastle United (@NUFC) April 7, 2025 The Magpies, now fifth, sit level on points with Chelsea above them, having played a game less, as the prospect of Champions League football at St. James’ Park next season becomes increasingly likely. Howe echoed Murphy’s comments, lauding his team for keeping their focus despite the euphoria of winning their long-awaited first major honour. “That was the biggest challenge for us. I can’t compliment them [the players] enough,” Howe said. “They are a very down to earth, humble group who want to do well and represent the club in the right way. They have shown that in the last few weeks.” Howe also remained realistic when asked about Champions League qualification, though, highlighting the difficulty of his side’s next three fixtures. They face Manchester United and in-form Crystal Palace at home, before a trip to Aston Villa, all within the space of six days. “It’s going to hot up. The next week for us is a big week. We have three really tough games and that will go a long way in seeing where we are at the end of the season,” he added. “We are in a better position than we were but there is still a lot of work to do.”",
