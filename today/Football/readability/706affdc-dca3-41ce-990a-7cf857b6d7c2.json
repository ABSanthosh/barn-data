  "text": "Competition: Spanish Segunda Market: Goal to be scored in both halves Odds: 3/4 @ Pribet Hoping to find a route back into the top-half of the Segunda standings on Sunday evening, Deportivo La Coruna will welcome Cartagena to the Riazor. Starting with the hosts, while Deportivo might have only made their Segunda return this season, La Coruna have enjoyed a real flurry. Breezing their way to second-tier safety at a canter, Oscar Gilsanz’s side have their sights firmly set on booking a top-half finish in 2025. Despite eventually settling for a 2-2 stalemate away at Castellon last time out, the Turks should find the mood in their camp at a continued high. Getting March underway with an eye-catching 2-1 win against Real Oviedo, Deportivo have suffered just a single defeat from any of their previous eight Segunda appearances over the past couple of months. With their extended flurry underlined by a 3-1 romp against Almeria on February 9th, La Coruna should be smelling a golden opportunity this weekend. Storming their way to a sensational 5-1 romp when they travelled to the Estadio Municipal Cartagonova for their reverse Segunda showdown on November 2nd, Gilsanz’s men will be seeking a repeat performance here. As for the visitors, enduring what has been a public Segunda crisis this season, Cartagena are set to lose their second-tier status with a whimper. Sat rock-bottom of the table and only putting 15 points on the board, the Zebras have rightfully come under a huge amount of scrutiny. Getting this weekend’s fixtures underway sat 16 points adrift of safety, the Murcia-based outfit have also broken a string of unwanted records this year. Putting in another downbeat display last time out as they fell to a 1-0 defeat at home against Burgos, Sunday’s guests have remarkably lost each of their previous nine consecutive Segunda appearances – a rut that stems all the way back to a 0-0 stalemate against Ferrol on January 11th. Likewise, Cartagena have remarkably mustered just a pair of points from all of their last 13 Segunda outings on either side of Spain’s festive break. Bet: Goal to be scored in both halves at Deportivo La Coruna vs Cartagena 3/4 for Sunday’s Segunda matchup @ Pribet",
