Atletico have now not lost or conceded a goal in their three Copa del Rey meetings against Getafe (W2 D1), and were worthy winners after a rampant showing. Atletico edged in front in the eighth minute when Javi Galan’s cross from the left-hand side was headed into the bottom corner by Simeone. The Argentine doubled his tally nine minutes later, rounding off a blistering counter-attack with a low finish past Jiri Letacek after good work from Julian Alvarez. Alvarez was involved once again in Atletico’s third just before the break, slipping in Samuel Lino, who sat down Juan Iglesias before rolling a right-footed finish into the net. Simeone thought he had completed his hat-trick shortly after the break, but his 49th-minute goal was ruled out for offside before being replaced by Cesar Azpilicueta. Atletico had to wait until the 78th minute for their fourth, with substitute Angel Correa firing home from distance after collecting Conor Gallagher’s pass just outside the box. Alexander Sorloth concluded the scoring four minutes from time, combining well with Correa following a mistake from Domingos Duarte with a neat finish past Letacek. Having secured a spot in the semi-finals for the second consecutive season, Atletico turn their attentions to LaLiga, where they face leaders Real Madrid on Saturday. Data Debrief: Rampant Atleti continue good form After seeing their 15-game winning run come to an end against Leganes earlier this month, Simeone’s side have now gone five games unbeaten across all competitions (W4 D1), with this perhaps their most complete performance in that streak. Madrid scored five or more goals in a Copa del Rey home game from the quarter-finals onwards for the first time since an 8-1 win over Real Sociedad in 1965 (semi-finals). They also entered the break three goals to the good, the first time they had done so in any competition since January 2023 against Real Valladolid in LaLiga (also 3-0). And the Atletico boss, not for the first time this season, has showcased his quality in reserve. Among LaLiga players with the most goals as substitutes across all competitions, Alvarez, Sorloth and Correa (all six) have given Simeone a selection headache ahead of this weekend’s Madrid derby.",
