Kai Havertz scored the only goal at the Emirates Stadium, as Mikel Arteta’s side climbed to second place and within six points of Premier League leaders Liverpool. Arsenal are the only team yet to lose at home in the Premier League this season, in which they are aiming to go the extra step, having been runners-up to Manchester City in each of the last two campaigns. And while Rice is pleased with the Gunners’ progress in 2024, the midfielder hopes they can take that next step and get their hands on silverware. “It has been a good year. We have done well, but it is not what we want,” he told Amazon Prime. “Hopefully, the new year brings trophies, to make that next step to be amongst the elite. We can keep winning games, but it doesn’t mean anything if you don’t win anything.” On the game, Rice added: “I think it has been constant thing for us – dominating games, but teams have been coming here with a low block – it is tough to break down a 5-4-1. “Second half, I feel we could have had one or two more [goals]. Luckily enough, in the end, it was an important win.” Here’s to 2025, Goonerspic.twitter.com/8NicMPzBTs — Arsenal (@Arsenal) December 27, 2024 Arsenal extended their unbeaten Premier League streak on home soil to 12 matches, while recording a fourth successive clean sheet at the Emirates for the first time since December 2021. “For sure, three points at home is nice,” Havertz said. “[Ipswich] didn’t have a proper chance, so we controlled the game well. “Home games are so important to us and we feel the energy. Everyone is together. We are one football club. The players, the fans, everyone needs to raise their level to win football matches.” Mikel Arteta highlighted Arsenal’s desire to eventually wipe out their deficit to Liverpool, who have a game in hand on the Gunners, while he praised his players’ ability to cope without the injured Bukayo Saka. “Frustration when you win? No. Things to improve? Yes,” he said when analysing the Ipswich win. “It was what it was. In the first half especially, we were super dominant and should have scored more chances. The second half, we didn’t start great and credit to them, they were tough to break down and are well-organised. “Considering all the circumstances we had this season – the amount of times we had to play with 10 men, all the injuries that we had – it’s good to be in the position that we are, but it’s not where we want to be. We want to be first.” On the players stepping up without Saka, who suffered a hamstring injury against Crystal Palace last weekend, he added: “Very good. It will be different. We had moments in the second half. It is a unit that is new and will take time for players to understand fully.”",
