  "text": "Paris Saint-Germain endured another difficult encounter against Reims at the Parc des Princes after being held to a 1-1 draw in Ligue 1 on Saturday. PSG have now failed to win any of their last three home league games against Reims, last doing so against a single opponent in the competitor against Bordeaux between August 2010 and August 2012. Luis Enrique’s side threatened in the opening exchanges with Ousmane Dembele the first to test Yehvann Diouf in the Reims goal following a dazzling run into the box. Goncalo Ramos then missed two glorious opportunities in quick succession, first forcing a save from Diouf before heading over Lee Kang-In’s teasing cross from a corner. But just two minutes after half-time, the Parisiens found the breakthrough when Dembele gathered debutant Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s pass to finish with the aid of a deflection. Reims, however, continued to probe despite going a goal down, with Junya Ito heading over from close range after being picked out by Keito Nakamura at the back post. The visitors were eventually rewarded for their pressure soon after when a sweeping counter-attack saw Nakamura guide the ball past a stranded Gianluigi Donnarumma. PSG failed to carve out any clear-cut opportunities from then on, with Nuno Mendes’ speculative strike from distance being comfortably gathered by Diouf late on. The result saw Luis Enrique’s side extend their lead at the Ligue 1 summit to 10 points, with second-placed Marseille in action against Nice on Sunday. Data Debrief: The streak continues Despite the disappointment of failing to move even further clear at the Ligue 1 summit, PSG ensured their unbeaten start to the season continued on home soil. Luis Enrique’s side have not lost any of their first 19 league games in 2024-25 (won 14, drawn five) for the fourth time in their history (after 1985-86, 2015-16 and 2018-19), more than all the other teams combined (St Etienne in 1957-58, Nantes in 1994-95, Lyon in 2004-05). But there will be cause for concern moving forward. The Parisiens have also now failed to win two of their last five games in which they scored the first goal after winning their previous 11 such games in the top-flight. It was also a promising start to his PSG career for Kvaratskhelia. He had the most touches in the opposition box (nine), as well as competing in the most duels for the hosts (19).",
