  "text": "Brazil have called up teenage Real Madrid striker Endrick to replace the injured Neymar for this month’s World Cup qualifiers. Santos forward Neymar was set to return to the Brazil team for the first time since he suffered a serious knee injury on international duty in late 2023. However, the 33-year-old has been ruled out of the Selecao’s World Cup qualifiers against Colombia and Argentina after sustaining a muscle issue. Coach Dorival Junior has also called up Flamengo defender Alex Sandro to replace Danilo, and Lyon goalkeeper Lucas Perri as a replacement for Manchester City’s Ederson. “Over the last few days, the Brazilian national team’s medical department has been updating us on the situation of all the players, especially Danilo, Neymar and Ederson,” Dorival Junior said in a CBF statement. “After the assessments, the national team’s medical department updated us on the situation of each player. “So we’re calling up Lucas Perri from Lyon, Alex Sandro from Flamengo and Endrick from Real Madrid.” Endrick has only played 496 minutes in all competitions for Madrid this season, struggling for regular gametime since his move from Palmeiras, though he has scored six goals. Brazil, who are fifth in the CONMEBOL standings with 18 points from 12 games, host fourth-placed Colombia on March 21 and visit leaders Argentina five days later. The top six teams qualify directly for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada.",
