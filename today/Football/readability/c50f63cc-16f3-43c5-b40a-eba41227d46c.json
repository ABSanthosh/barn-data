The Gers returned from the final international break of the year in style as they began the defence of the trophy they won for the first time in the club’s history last season. Kirsty Howat and Jane Ross scored five goals each, with Mia McAulay netting a hat-trick as well as a double for Sarah Ewens in her first minutes of the campaign. There was also a competitive first-team debut for 15-year-old Lily Boyce, playing the entirety of the second half in the third round tie at Lawsondale Playing Fields. “Obviously, we scored a lot of goals, disappointed with the one that we conceded, but job done really. We have spoken about habits before,” assistant Jay Bradford said. “It is about us maintaining our standards and making sure we are doing what we want to see from a staff perspective and I thought we did that for the most part.” Full Time at Lawsondale A hat-trick for Mia McAulay, a fifth goal from Jane Ross and a second goal for Sarah Ewens.
