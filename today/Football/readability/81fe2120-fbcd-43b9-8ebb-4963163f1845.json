  "text": "Kieran McKenna was frustrated to see yet another lead slip through Ipswich Town’s fingers as they conceded two penalties in Sunday’s 2-2 draw with Fulham. Having beaten Chelsea last time out, Ipswich were on course to record back-to-back wins for the first time this season as they entered second-half stoppage time 2-1 up. Sammie Szmodics had put the Tractor Boys ahead in the first half, with Liam Delap scoring a penalty to re-establish their advantage after Raul Jimenez equalised with a spot-kick of his own. However, Jimenez scored another penalty in the 91st minute after being fouled by Leif Davis, ensuring Fulham stretched their unbeaten run to seven games (two wins, five draws). Ipswich, meanwhile, remain in the relegation zone, behind 17th-placed Wolves – who host Nottingham Forest on Monday – on goal difference. McKenna’s team have now dropped 17 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season – only Fulham (19) and Brighton (18) have dropped more. “There were lots of good things about the performance, a really good game and one we could have won,” McKenna told BBC Sport. “I’m disappointed we have given away two penalties. We put ourselves in a really good position in the second half. “The two penalties that we conceded were frustrating because they were both breakaways from our attacks.” Ipswich have now conceded five goals via penalties this season, with only Wolves able to match that figure in the Premier League. However, McKenna believes his side have made an important breakthrough lately, having also been competitive in a 1-0 defeat at Arsenal before registering their win over Chelsea. “We had the better chances in the second half from open play. I think we have learned how to manage games,” he said. “We’ve had a good last three performances; Arsenal, Chelsea and Fulham. We have been competitive most of the season. Today, maybe we have left a couple of points out there.” Ipswich also completed their first signing of the January transfer window on Sunday, bringing in Atalanta defender Ben Godfrey on loan for the remainder of the season. Godfrey, who has been capped by England twice but had fallen out of favour with the Scudetto contenders, told Ipswich’s website: “It’s been an exciting couple of days and I’m just delighted to have signed and can’t wait to meet the lads and get started. “I have really enjoyed speaking to the manager and to have the opportunity to work under him now is something I’m very excited about. “I’ve watched a lot of the games from the first half of the season and you can tell from those that the group is a tight one, full of players giving everything to achieve their goals.”",
