  "text": "Sean Dyche believes Everton’s confidence has grown because of their recent results against some of the Premier League’s biggest clubs, as they prepare to face his former side Nottingham Forest. Dyche, who began his playing career at Forest, has overseen a four-match unbeaten run for the Toffees, who beat Wolves 4-0 before drawing with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City. They had Jordan Pickford to thank for their latest point as he saved an Erling Haaland penalty in their 1-1 Boxing Day draw at the Etihad Stadium, though Wolves’ win over Manchester United later pulled them within three points of the relegation zone. After a dire start to the season, Dyche believes his team are in an improved spot, saying: “I don’t remember too many times when we’ve lacked pure confidence. “We didn’t get off to a good start, so many things went against us, some of it our own doing. “But I don’t think it was a lack of confidence. Of course, confidence is driven and built by time and getting the right results and right performances, so I think we’re in a better place than earlier in the season.” Forest, meanwhile, are flying high in the Champions League places after beating Tottenham 1-0 via an Anthony Elanga goal on Boxing Day, leaving Dyche impressed. “I think like most people, I’m impressed with what they’ve been doing,” Dyche said of Forest. “They’re pretty organised, working on the counter, they defend well and they’ve brought Chris Wood to life, with the goals he’s been scoring. “They’ve put together a very strong outfit and we have to make sure we’re delivering.” The two teams found themselves embroiled in a battle for survival last season, with Everton winning their last meeting 2-0 in April – when Forest saw three penalty appeals denied and later complained about refereeing standards via their social media accounts. Coach Nuno Espirito Santo, though, has witnessed an improvement this campaign, saying: “This is what is normal. In my view, what happened before was not normal “I think we are seeing a season of improvement and we are delighted because what we wanted is to play the game and ignore everything else.” “I hope it continues because us coaches and players we don’t want to think about the referee, we just want to play football.” PLAYERS TO WATCH Everton – Jordan Pickford Pickford has saved his last two penalties faced in the Premier League, including one from Haaland last time out. Since he joined Everton ahead of the 2017-18 season, only Lukasz Fabianski (10) has saved more spot-kicks in the competition than Pickford (seven). Nottingham Forest – Anthony Elanga After a run of 28 Premier League games without a goal, Elanga has now scored in each of his last three for Forest. Two of his three strikes this season have been winning goals – his previous four Premier League goals had all come in defeats. MATCH PREDICTION – DRAW Nottingham Forest have won their last four Premier League games, last winning five in a row in the top flight between March and April 1995. They beat Manchester United 2-1 in their final league game of 2023, last winning their final game in consecutive calendar years between 2008 and 2010. Their last trip to Merseyside saw them win 1-0 at Liverpool in September. In their entire league history, they have only won away against both Everton and Liverpool in a single season once before, doing so in 1898-99. However, no team has drawn more Premier League games than Everton this season (eight). Each of the Toffees’ last three contests have finished level, last having a longer run of consecutive draws in September 2022 (four). This is the first time Everton are playing their final league game of a calendar year at home since 2015, losing 4-3 to Stoke City on that occasion. In fact, they have only won their last league game in two of the last 10 years (2019 v Newcastle United, 2020 v Sheffield United). OPTA WIN PROBABILITY Everton – 37.3% Nottingham Forest – 34.4% Draw – 28.3%",
