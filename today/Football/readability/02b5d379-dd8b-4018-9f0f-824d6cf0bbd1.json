  "text": "New York City FC will face the New York Red Bulls for a place in the Eastern Conference final after a 6-5 penalty shootout victory over FC Cincinnati. In a shootout during which five spot-kicks were missed, Mitja Ilenic kept his cool to slam home and get NYCFC over the line after a 0-0 draw in Ohio. Cincinnati, last season’s Supporters’ Shield winners, had the better of the chances at TQL Stadium, though NYCFC did have a goal disallowed midway through the second half, with Alonso Martínez having been flagged offside. But Nick Cushing, who this week insisted he wanted to stay at NYCFC amid reported interest from Arsenal Women, saw his team get the job done in dramatic fashion. NYCFC goalkeeper Matt Freese, who made a crucial save to deny Luca Orellano on the half-hour mark, looked set to be the hero until his counterpart Roman Celentano thwarted Thiago Martins. Freese’s save from Gerardo Valenzuela then sparked a remarkable streak of five straight missed penalties, with Kevin O’Toole denied by Celentano, Chidozie Awaziem and Andres Perea blazing over, and Teenage Hadebe kept out by NYCFC’s shot-stopper, before Ilenic finally showed how it was done. NYCFC will now go up against their city rivals next week, while Cincinnati must lick their wounds heading into the offseason. I GUESS IT’S TWO STRIKES AND YOU’RE OUT pic.twitter.com/RgfhRDxR4O — New York City FC (@newyorkcityfc) November 9, 2024 Data Debrief: Away form a concern for Cushing While New York can celebrate making the Conference semi-finals, they have now won only one of their last 15 away games in all competitions. Indeed, NYCFC have won just five of their last 41 road matches in all competitions since the start of the 2023 season. Their meagre 0.28 expected goals (xG), compared to Cincinnati’s 1.13, across the 90 minutes showed they were largely outplayed, and Cushing will be glad next week’s semi-final will take place on home turf – with NYCFC the sixth seed, whereas the Red Bulls are the seventh.",
