  "text": "Bayern Munich’s financial position could thwart a move for Bayer Leverkusen star Florian Wirtz, but the club are hopeful Jamal Musiala will pen a new contract soon. That is according to Bayern chief executive Jan-Christian Dreesen, who discussed the club’s squad-building plans in an interview with German outlet Abendzeitung. Wirtz has attracted interest from a host of Europe’s biggest clubs after helping Leverkusen to an unbeaten title triumph in 2023-24, winning the Bundesliga’s Player of the Season award after scoring 11 goals and providing 11 assists in the competition. Wirtz has four goals and two assists in the league so far this term, while only Alex Grimaldo (35) and Kevin Stoger (33) have bettered his 26 chances created in the Bundesliga and his figure of 3.9 expected assists (xA) puts him second to Grimaldo (4.22). Bayern’s tendency to swoop for Germany’s brightest and best has led to them being linked with Wirtz, but Dreesen says finances will dictate their ability to make a move. “It must always be in Bayern’s interest to have the best German players with them,” he said. “But it is also true that Uli Hoeness always said Bayern must act in an economically sensible way. He would not agree with us if we did not observe both of his fundamental pillars.” Since the start of last season, Wirtz leads all players in the Bundesliga for successful dribbles, with 112. Second by that metric by Musiala, who has completed 109 for Bayern in that time. Bayern are set to open talks over a new deal with the attacking midfielder, whose current deal with the Bavarian giants expires in 2026. “It’s no news that we naturally want to extend with one of the top players in the world who is in our ranks,” Dreesen said. “Jamal Musiala has developed excellently with us, he is a player who inspires the crowd, who creates a spectacle due to his individual class, who can turn a game around. “I very much hope that these first really good talks that Max Eberl and Christoph Freund have with Jamal will ultimately lead to an extension. “I don’t want to put this in a corset in terms of time. The important thing is that it comes to that, even if it doesn’t happen by the end of the year. Jamal Musiala is one of the faces of the future for FC Bayern.” Dreesen is also keen to see Joshua Kimmich put pen to paper on a new contract, with the midfielder having less than a year to run on his current deal. “Joshua, who has a high degree of sporting ambition, knows which club he is in and what goals he can achieve here together with us,” Dreesen said. “He feels comfortable in Munich and is a very important player in this team. “We have already said publicly that we now want to start talks with him about a contract extension quickly.”",
