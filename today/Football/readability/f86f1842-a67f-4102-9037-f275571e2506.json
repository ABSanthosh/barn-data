  "text": "Verdict: PSG win Best Odds: 1/2 Bookmaker: Dachbet Turning their attention back to Ligue 1 duties on Sunday night, PSG will welcome Marseille to the Parc des Princes. PSG Starting with the hosts, booking their Champions League quarter-final ticket earlier in the week as they edged past English giants Liverpool on foreign soil, PSG are enjoying what has become a sensational run of form. Turning their attention back to domestic action on Sunday night holding a dominant 16-point buffer at the top of the Ligue 1 standings, Luis Enrique’s side have their sights firmly set on completing a famous double-winning campaign this season. Simply looking to lay down another marker this weekend, the former Barcelona boss has seen his squad receive a string of plaudits from across the continent. Getting March underway with a 4-1 romp against historic rivals Lille, PSG have also gained a fearsome reputation for their free-scoring performances in the final third. In fact, Sunday’s hosts have remarkably notched 70 goals in their 25 Ligue 1 appearances this season. PSG Team News Heading into Sunday’s return to Paris, PSG have reported a clean bill of health and have no fresh injury concerns. Settling for a spot on the bench away at Anfield earlier in the week, Portuguese marksman Goncalo Ramos could be handed a full recall and lead the line here. Finding the net on Merseyside in midweek and enjoying what has been a remarkable free-scoring run since opening the New Year, Ousmane Dembele will play a leading role on Sunday night. Warren Zaire-Emery could replace former Wolves loanee Vitinha in the middle of the park. Marseille As for the visitors, making an immediate return to losing ways last weekend as they slumped to a shock 1-0 loss at home against Lens, Marseille have seen their title blows take a critical blow over the past few weeks. Signing off February with what was an infamous 3-0 drumming at the hands of Auxerre, Roberto De Zerbi’s men should be bracing themselves for another heavyweight challenge here. Rightfully pencilled in as a landslide underdog on Sunday night, Marseille will be concerned by a nightmare record against the defending champions. Slumping to another 3-0 loss when they welcomed their historic rivals to the Stade Velodrome for their reverse Ligue 1 meeting on October 27th, they have lost each of their previous four top-flight meetings by an aggregate score of 12-0. Marseille Team News Still dealing with respective injury issues, Marseille will once again be without the likes of Ruben Blanco, Amine Harit and Cameroon international Fairs Moumbagna this weekend. However, after serving a two-match suspension, former Malmo defender Derek Cornelius will return to De Zerbi’s squad on Sunday night. Registering six direct goal contributions his his previous seven domestic appearances, Algerian marksman Amine Gouiri should keep his spot leading the line. Forced to settle for a spot on the bench last weekend, former Manchester United youngster Mason Greenwood will be hoping for a full recall. PSG vs Marseille Key Factors to Consider When PSG and Marseille met for their reverse Ligue 1 meeting on October 27th, Sunday’s hosts collected a routine 3-0 victory at the Stade Velodrome. In fact, PSG have won each of their previous four Ligue 1 meetings by an aggregate score of 12-0. PSG have recorded a remarkable 70 goals in their 25 Ligue 1 appearances so far this season. Including a 1-0 loss at home against Lens last weekend, Marseille have lost two of their previous three Ligue 1 appearances. Sunday’s guests have collected just a single Ligue 1 victory at the Parc des Princes since February 2010. Conclusion Extending on their Champions League adventure earlier in the week following a famous night at Anfield, PSG are enjoying what has become a remarkable romp. Getting this weekend’s fixtures underway holding a dominant 16-point buffer at the top of the Ligue 1 table, Enrique’s men will be looking to make another heavyweight statement here. Cruising to a 3-0 victory when they travelled to the Stade Velodrome on October 27th, PSG hold a dominant record against their historic rivals. Winning their previous four meetings by an aggregate score of 12-0, we are expecting a similar outcome here. Verdict: PSG win Best Odds: 1/2 Bookmaker: Dachbet",
