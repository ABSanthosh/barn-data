  "text": "Verdict: Real Madrid win Best Odds: 7/11 Bookmaker: Luckster Desperately seeking a much-needed response on Sunday afternoon, Real Madrid will travel to the Basque Country when they meet Alaves. Alaves Starting with the hosts, while Alaves might have sprung a real La Liga upset last season as they claimed a top-half finish among Spain’s elite, Eduardo Coudet’s side have drastically failed to replicate and level of success this time around. Despite opening April with a gritty 1-0 victory away at Girona, the Babazorros are still at the heart of a relegation scrap and open this weekend’s fixtures holding just a two-point buffer over the drop zone. Marking their return from March’s international break with a 2-0 loss at the hands of Rayo Vallecano, Alaves have won just a pair of their previous 10 La Liga appearances. It should also be highlighted, Sunday’s hosts have mustered just a single top-flight victory in the Basque Country since the start of November. Alaves Team News All picking up costly second-half bookings against Girona last weekend, Alaves will be unable to call upon the suspended trio of Jon Guridi, Tomas Conechny and Antonio Sivera on Sunday afternoon. However, serving his own respective one-match ban last week, Argentinian defender Nahuel Tenaglia to their squad here. Former Real Madrid youngster Antonio Blanco will partner Joan Jordan in the middle of the park. Notching 11 La Liga strikes this season, one-time Middlesbrough striker Kike Garcia will spearhead Coudet’s attack. Real Madrid As for the visitors, putting in what was an infamous Champions League performance away at Arsenal earlier in the week as they fell to a 3-0 drumming, Real Madrid watched their European dreams take what could be a crucial blow. Suffering last-gasp heartbreak at home against Valencia last weekend as they slumped to a 2-1 defeat in the capital, Carlo Ancelotti has a tremendous amount of pressure on his shoulders. Currently sat four points adrift of arch-rivals Barcelona, the former AC Milan boss will also have a mounting headache over his side’s extended defensive struggles. Shipping 11 goals across all competitions from their four appearances since returning from March’s international break, Madrid have also failed to notch a single clean sheet since the end of February. Real Madrid Team News All still dealing with respective injury issues, Real Madrid will once again be unable to call upon the likes of Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao and French defender Ferland Mendy. However, after serving a European ban away at Arsenal earlier in the week, Aurélien Tchouaméni will return to Los Blancos’ squad here. With Ancelotti expected to make a handful of changes this weekend, Morocco international Brahim Diaz could be handed a full recall. Bagging 22 La Liga strikes since completing his blockbuster move from PSG last summer, French skipper Kylian Mbappe will spearhead Madrid’s attack in the Basque Country. Alaves vs Real Madrid Key Factors to Consider When Alaves and Real Madrid met for their reverse La Liga meeting on September 24th, Los Blancos collected an action-packed 3-2 victory on home soil. In fact, Madrid have won each of their previous six consecutive meetings against Sunday’s hosts. The reigning Spanish champions have shipped 11 goals in their four appearances since returning from March’s international break. Alaves have recorded just a single La Liga victory in the Basque Country since the start of November. Six of the last seven meetings between Alaves and Real Madrid have finished with over 2.5 goals. Conclusion Rightfully coming under a huge amount of scrutiny on Tuesday night following their 3-0 drumming against Arsenal, Real Madrid are desperately seeking an immediate response here. With both their European and domestic title dreams taking a major blow over the past week, Los Blancos should at least take some solace from their dominat record against Sunday’s hosts. Including a dramatic 3-2 victory when they welcomed Alaves to the capital back on September 24th, they have won all of their previous six meetings. Knowing that they can’t afford any more public slip-ups, we are backing an away victory this weekend. Verdict: Real Madrid win  Best Odds: 7/11 Bookmaker: Luckster",
