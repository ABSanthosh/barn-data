Alexis Saelemaekers struck the post early on for the hosts, who took the lead in the 16th minute, with Reijnders’ thumping first-time strike leaving Mile Svilar with no chance. However, the visitors were level just seven minutes later as Artem Dovbyk flicked Niccolo Pisilli’s throughball into the path of Dybala, who volleyed home from close range. Both sides pushed for the game’s third goal during the second half. Svilar did well to claw away Samuel Chukwueze’s curling 20-yard effort, while Mike Maignan tipped Eldor Shomurodov’s header onto the crossbar later on, with the contest ending in a stalemate. It ends all square.#MilanRoma #SempreMilan Brought to you by @Bitpanda_global pic.twitter.com/nm8XQSYp1r — AC Milan (@acmilan) December 29, 2024 Data Debrief: Honours even as Giallorossi remain winless on their travels Milan and Roma shared the spoils for the third time in the last five Serie A meetings between the sides. However, the Giallorossi’s winless streak away from home across all competitions stretched to 16 matches, last enduring a longer span during the 1998-99 season (17). Nevertheless, they did claim a point, with Dybala the scourge of Milan once again. The forward has now been involved in the most Serie A goals against the Rossoneri (13; eight goals and five assists).",
