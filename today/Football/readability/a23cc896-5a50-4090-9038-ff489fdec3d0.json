  "text": "Poland kept their hopes of reaching the Nations League quarter-finals alive after battling back for a 3-3 draw against 10-man Croatia on Tuesday. Michal Probierz’s side know they must win both of their last two matches in November to stand a chance of finishing in the top two, with Croatia missing the chance to go within a point of Group A3 leaders Portugal after their goalless draw with Scotland. Poland took the lead in the fifth minute when Piotr Zielinski’s effort deflected off Martin Erlic and beyond Dominik Livakovic, only for Borna Sosa to restore parity soon after. The visitors then silenced Stadion Narodowy with two goals in quick succession, as Petar Sucic fired into the far corner before turning provider for Martin Baturina’s first senior international goal. But the first-half scoring was not finished there, with Nicola Zalewski taking advantage of some poor Croatia defending to reduce the arrears on the stroke of half-time. Robert Lewandowski entered the fray just after the hour, and made an instant impact to help level the scores six minutes after his introduction, teeing up Sebastian Szymanski, who curled past Livakovic. An enthralling encounter took another twist with 14 minutes remaining when Livakovic was sent off for a high challenge on Lewandowski after clearing the ball, but Poland were unable to take advantage of their one-man advantage. WHAT A GAME #NationsLeague pic.twitter.com/BqsLUkWF34 — UEFA EURO 2024 (@EURO2024) October 15, 2024 Data Debrief: Poland halt Croatia hoodoo While Poland failed to take advantage of Livakovic’s dismissal, they ended a run of three consecutive defeats against Croatia, though their last victory against them came in 2006. The hosts will be disappointed not to have tested Livakovic’s replacement Nediljko Labrovic, with Kacper Urbanski sending the only efforts on his goal off target in the closing stages. Poland managed an expected goals (xG) total of 1.25 from their 14 shots compared to Croatia’s 1.39 from 15 attempts, with the home side’s attacking threat led by Szymanski, who created more chances (three) than any other player on the pitch.",
