  "text": "Putting in what was a dominant display in Catalonia on Sunday afternoon, Barcelona stormed their way to a sensational 4-0 romp against Real Sociedad. Knowing that they could skyrocket their way back to the top of the La Liga table this weekend, Hansi Flick’s side were handed an early boost as Aritz Elustondo received a straight red card in the 17th-minute for bringing down a goalbound Dani Olmo. Continuing to shine since opening the New Year, Barca bagged a quickfire brace just before the half hour mark as Gerard Martin and Marc Casado putting Sunday’s hosts in the driving seat. With a party atmosphere around Catalonia, Flick’s side continued to dominate after the half-time break as Ronald Araujo and the record-breaking Robert Lewandowski laid down a title marker. Leapfrogging Atletico Madrid and enjoying what has become a real purple patch, Barcelona appear to be hitting top gear at a crucial time of the season. On an afternoon when Barca found a route back to the top of the La Liga table, we have taken a look at the main talking points from Catalonia. Barca move themselves back into pole position While some around Catalonia might have been shocked last summer following Flick’s arrival, Barcelona have embarked on a sensational rise under the former Bayern Munich boss. Although Sunday’s hosts might have entered Spain’s festive break in the midst of a minor blip, the German tactician has seen his squad come roaring back in a remarkable fashion. Crowned Super Cup champions back on January 12th following a famous 5-2 victory against arch-rivals Real Madrid over in the Middle East, Barca are now unbeaten in each of their last 15 appearances across all competitions. With the mood around Catalonia at a red-hot high and with Flick’s camp now widely regarded as a genuine title contender in 2025, Barca certainly laid down what was another major statement of intent here. Riding what has become quote the wave of momentum, Barcelona will be looking to extend of their clinical purple patch when they turn their attention back to Champions League action on Wednesday night. Flick’s free-scoring attack continue to shine Although Barca might have suffered an infamous Copa del Rey collapse earlier in the week as they eventually had to settle for a remarkable 4-4 stalemate in Catalonia, Flick’s side certainly claimed an immediate response here. While the title contenders might have now recorded a clean sheet in each of their previous three consecutive La Liga appearances, they have gained a fearsome reputation for their free-scoring performances in the final third. Along with notching a quartet of goals in back-to-back domestic appearances over the past week, Barcelona have also registered at least four strikes in four of their previous six showdowns across all fronts. Signing off January with a famous 7-1 romp against Valencia, Barca have remarkably notched 71 goals in their 26 La Liga appearances this season and comfortably hold the best-attacking tally among Spain’s elite. In fact, on what has become a record-breaking flurry, Flick’s squad have notched 52 goals across all competitions since opening the New Year. Issues on the road continue to haunt Sociedad Getting their Copa del Rey semi-final adventure underway with a 1-0 loss at home against Real Madrid earlier in the week, Sociedad were always aware that they faced another heavyweight challenge on Sunday afternoon. Completely blown away in Catalonia here, Imanol Alguacil’s side suddenly find themselves holding just a one-point buffer from slipping out of the top-half of the La Liga table. Despite extending on their Europa League adventure last month as they secured an action-packed 7-3 aggregate win against Danish outfit Midtjylland, Sociedad have also gained a reputation for their extended issues on the road. Coming under real scrutiny last month as they fell to a routine 3-0 drumming at the hands of Real Betis, Alguacil’s camp have lost five of their previous six showdowns outside of the Basque Country. With pressure starting to mount on Alguacil’s shoulders, Sociedad will be next seen on Thursday evening when they welcome Premier League giants Manchester United to the Reale Arena.
