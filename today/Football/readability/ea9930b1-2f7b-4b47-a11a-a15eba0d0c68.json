  "text": "Jesper Sorensen is confident the Vancouver Whitecaps will soon return to their top level. The Whitecaps started the season brilliantly, but a run of three defeats in the space of four MLS games has seen them relinquish top spot in the Western Conference. Vancouver suffered just one defeat in their first 16 matches of the season. They sit on 38 points from 20 games, and have a game in hand over leaders San Diego FC, who are only one point ahead. Next up is a clash with the Colorado Rapids, who are winless in three matches, and Sorensen is unconcerned by his team’s recent dip. Speaking after a midweek win over Valour FC in the Canadian Championship, Sorensen said: “Instead of having the flow between players, the relationships, we’ve been a bit broken up. “Players have been in and out, some injuries, some players unavailable so we’ve played with new players all the time. “It’s normal. It’s not normal to go through a season the way we started out. We’ve already played a lot of games, we’ve already played a full season. It’s normal that you have some variation over the course of the season. “We’ll pick it up again. We’ve been relying a lot on the same players performing, and it’s normal that it’s not just a straight line – it’s up and down in the season. We’ll pick up again.” Colorado sit 10th in the West, 12 points behind the Whitecaps. The Rapids were hammered 3-0 by Los Angeles FC on Wednesday. Headed straight into your camera roll. pic.twitter.com/14x78ZJ84q — Vancouver Whitecaps FC (@WhitecapsFC) July 10, 2025 PLAYERS TO WATCH Colorado Rapids – Djordje Mihailovic Mihailovic has been the Rapids’ main goal threat this season, scoring eight times in 21 MLS appearances. He also leads the Rapids for shots on target (18), though he has only netted once from outside the box, so the Whitecaps would be well advised to keep him away from the danger area. Vancouver Whitecaps – Brian White There is no question over Vancouver’s main man – White has been in superb form this campaign, scoring 10 league goals. The Whitecaps have totalled just 10 shots and two on target in their last two regular-season matches after entering those matches averaging 18.0 shots and 5.2 on target per match, so they need to get their striker involved more often. MATCH PREDICTION: VANCOUVER WIN After suffering just two defeats in their first nine home matches of the season in all competitions (W5 D2), Colorado have lost two of three at home. The Rapids have scored one total goal in their five home defeats this season while totalling 15 goals in the other eight matches (W6 D2). Vancouver have won each of their last two meetings with Colorado. This is the third time the Whitecaps have defeated the Rapids in consecutive meetings, though they have never won three in a row against them. OPTA WIN PROBABILITY Colorado Rapids – 28.7% Vancouver Whitecaps – 46.4% Draw – 24.4%",
