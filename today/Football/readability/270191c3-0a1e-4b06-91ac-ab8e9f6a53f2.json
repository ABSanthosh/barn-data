  "text": "Competition: Irish Premier Division Market: Shelbourne draw no bet Odds: 19/20 @ BetUS Looking to secure consecutive Premier Division victories, Shelbourne will welcome Derry City to Tolka Park on Friday night. Starting with the host, while Shelbourne might have made real history last season as they clinched a maiden Premier Division crown, Damien Duff’s side have already accepted that they will relinquish their top-flight title this time around. However, still dreaming of the chance to book another famous European adventure this year, the one-time Chelsea star finds his squad sat just a single point adrift of breaking into the top-three. Last seen putting in a rugged performance as they claimed a 1-0 victory away at St. Patrick’s, the reigning Premier Division have lost just one of their previous five appearances. Looking to make a statement here, Duff’s camp will also be desperate to secure consecutive wins for the first time since back in February. Despite being last seen at Tolka Park getting hit with a 2-1 defeat against runaway leaders Shamrock, Shelbourne have lost just a pair of their previous eight matchups in front of their own supporters – a run that stems back to March 7th. As for the visitors, while Derry City might have got May underway in the midst of a stellar purple patch, the Candystripes have struggled to find any kind of fluidity over the past six weeks. Missing out on what they billed as a golden opportunity last time out as they had to settle for a 1-1 stalemate at home against Galway, Tiernan Lynch’s side have collected just a single point from their previous four Premier Division appearances. Likewise, signing off May with a 1-0 defeat away at Bohemians, Friday’s guests have registered just a sole victory on their travels since the middle of April. Enduring what has become their longest winless rut of the season so far, Derry City should also be concerned by their most recent trip to Tolka Park. Hit with a routine 3-1 defeat when they travelled to the defending champions back on February 14th, it should also be highlighted that Lynch’s camp have failed to win any of their last four Premier Division trips to Shelbourne. Bet: Shelbourne draw no bet against Derry City 19/20 for Friday’s Irish Premier Division matchup @ BetUS",
