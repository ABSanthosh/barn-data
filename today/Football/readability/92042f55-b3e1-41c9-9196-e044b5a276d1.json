  "text": "Celtic were held to a 1-1 draw by Club Brugge after Cameron Carter-Vickers’ bizarre own-goal in their Champions League encounter. Daizen Maeda rescued a point for Brendan Rodgers’ side, who extended their unbeaten start to the season on home soil across all competitions. Brugge controlled large periods of the first half and broke the deadlock after 26 minutes, albeit in hugely fortuitous circumstances. Under pressure from the visitors’ press, Carter-Vickers played a blind backpass intended for Kasper Schmeichel, who was out of his goal, and the ball rolled into the empty net. Celtic were much-improved after the break, though they had Schmeichel to thank with his fine reflex save denying Maxim De Cuyper. The hosts equalised on the hour mark, as Maeda cut inside before brilliantly bending a shot in off the far post. Brugge thought they had regained the lead nine minutes later, but Ferran Jutgla’s effort was penalised following a VAR review, as the sides shared the spoils. The points are shared in Paradise. #CelticClubBrugge | #UCL | #CelticFCpic.twitter.com/QrMHpJQhf1 — Celtic Football Club (@CelticFC) November 27, 2024 Data Debrief: Celtic stretch unbeaten streak Celtic have gone unbeaten in three Champions League games for the first time since doing so between December 2008 and October 2012.
