  "text": "The LA Galaxy claimed a record-extending sixth MLS Cup by beating the New York Red Bulls 2-1, with early goals from Joseph Paintsil and Dejan Joveljic securing the trophy. The Galaxy raced into a two-goal lead within 13 minutes as they made a blistering start on home soil at Dignity Health Sports Park, and they held firm after the Red Bulls halved the arrears midway through the first half. Gaston Brugman threaded a lovely throughball into the path of Paintsil, who slotted his finish under Carlos Coronel for a ninth-minute opener. Four minutes later, Greg Vanney’s men had breathing space as Joveljic escaped the Red Bulls backline to prod home with the outside of his boot. Daniel Edelman narrowly avoided putting through his own net soon afterwards, then New York clawed one back through captain Sean Nealis, who volleyed home following an inswinging corner Emil Forsberg. Noah Eile missed one glorious chance before teeing up another for Dante Vanzeir, but the Galaxy held firm, almost adding a third goal when Miki Yamane cannoned a shot against the post shortly after the hour-mark. #MLSCup pres. by Audi pic.twitter.com/h4JeGBnEhK — Major League Soccer (@MLS) December 7, 2024 Data Debrief: Galaxy out on their own The LA Galaxy already held the record for most MLS Cup triumphs ahead of Saturday’s showpiece game, with their sixth success now taking them two clear of D.C.
