  "text": "Competition: Spanish Segunda Market: Huesca draw no bet Odds: 8/15 @ Pribet Hoping to find a route into the play-off places, Huesca will welcome Tenerife to the Estadio El Alcoraz on Thursday night. Starting with the hosts, while Huesca might have only just clung to their Segunda status last season, Antonio Hidalgo’s men have come roaring back in a sensational fashion. Putting in another gritty performance last weekend as they claimed a 1-0 victory away at Racing Santander, the Aragon-based outfit have their sights firmly set on punching a play-off ticket this season. Opening Thursday’s showdown sat within touching distance of skyrocketing into the top-six, the former Sevilla boss should find the mood in his camp at a red-hot high. Extending on their Copa del Rey adventure earlier in the month as they claimed a 1-0 win against Gimnastic, the Azulgranas have won each of their previous four appearances across all competitions. Signing off November with a dominant 3-0 romp against Real Oviedo, Huesca should be smelling another golden opportunity in midweek. It should also be noted, Hidalgo’s side have not conceded a single strike on their four-match winning run. Likewise, the play-off contenders have not suffered a single defeat at the Estadio El Alcoraz since the middle of September. As for the visitors, falling to what was a routine 3-0 drumming away at Cordoba last weekend, Tenerife find themselves at the heart of an infamous Segunda rut. Sat rock-bottom of the table and pencilled in as a leading relegation candidate, Pepe Mel’s downbeat squad have an almighty uphill battle on their hands. Only putting 11 points on the board from any of their first 17 Segunda appearances, the former Las Palmas boss has some serious pressure on his shoulders. Opening the midweek fixtures sat 10 points adrift of finding a route out of the drop zone, Thursday’s guests should be bracing themselves for another heavyweight challenge here. Shipping nine goals in their previous four Segunda appearances, Tenerife have also gained a reputation for their issues on the road. In fact, Mel’s side have lost their previous three Segunda showdowns away from the Estadio de Tenerife by an aggregate score of 8-1. Given what has been a huge recent gulf in class between Thursday’s opponents, a home draw no bet can be found at appealing odds. Bet: Huesca draw no bet against Tenerife 8/15 for Thursday’s Segunda showdown @ Pribet",
