The Manchester City striker was captaining his first nation for the first time, and marked the occasion in trademark record-breaking fashion. Haaland broke the deadlock after just seven minutes of the Nations League clash at the Ullevaal Stadium, where Alexander Sorloth doubled the lead seven minutes after the restart. Sorloth then turned provider just after the hour mark for Haaland, who broke Jorgen Juve’s 87-year record with his 34th international goal in just 36 caps. The result put Norway firmly in charge of Group B3 with seven points, three ahead of Austria and Slovenia, with Kazakhstan propping up the table on one point.
