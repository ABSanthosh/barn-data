  "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo sees no need for Portugal’s players to be nervous as they aim to turn around their Nations League tie with Denmark. Portugal went down 1-0 in the first leg of the Nations League quarter-final tie against the Danes on Thursday. Rasmus Hojlund scored in the 78th minute in Copenhagen, where Christian Eriksen had missed a penalty in the first half. Portugal managed only two shots on target and accumulated just 0.51 expected goals, and though Ronaldo conceded there is tension around the squad, he does not think the nerves are setting in. “There’s always attitude in the national team. Technical aspects, of course, but other things were lacking too. That’s football, you can’t always play well,” the Portugal captain said. “The atmosphere wasn’t favourable either. I’ve played 50,000 bad games, and so has the team. Our players, who are used to playing on big stages, have also played bad games. That’s part of it. “There’s no need to be nervous. The past is the past. I know there are a lot of people who want us to lose, but if the few who are there are united and have good energy, I’m sure we’ll get a great result. “The air is tense. I’m not hiding it. We’re in a tense moment because we need to win, but that’s the beautiful thing about football. “I’m calling on the fans to be with us. Let them give us their strength, because we’re going to try to do our best. Amanhã não somos apenas 11 em campo, somos a força de um país inteiro. Vamos lutar com tudo o que temos para avançar. Juntos! pic.twitter.com/zXMPQR2Pel — Cristiano Ronaldo (@Cristiano) March 22, 2025 “I’ve lost games in 90 minutes, but I’ve never lost in the first leg. There are games like that, there are bad days. I didn’t play at all the other day, the team didn’t play at all, but it’s part of life. “I want to leave with my head held high. If I score, I’ll be happy, but if I don’t score, let someone else score, what I want is for Portugal to win.” Ronaldo managed only 30 touches in the first leg, less than any other Portugal player to start the game, though he did complete all of his 24 passes while having two attempts, though he did not hit the target with either of them. Portugal boasted 68 final third entries but translated that to just 16 touches in Denmark’s box. Ronaldo, though, defended coach Roberto Martinez, who has come in for criticism. “I think it’s unfair to criticise the coach, because we’re all in the same boat,” Ronaldo added. “We lost the game and played badly, but we have the second leg. Think positive and think that things will go well.”",
