That moment came just two weeks after Zirkzee was hooked on 33 minutes in United’s 2-0 defeat to Newcastle United at the end of November. According to Fernandes, it was fully deserved after a period in which the Dutch forward had been working hard. “The script was already there for a long time,” he said. “You know, when you are a good person, when you do the right things, you can have bad moments, but at the end everything will come through strong. “It was a decision by the staff to pick the five players to have the penalty, and they put Josh last. The only thing it came into my mind was to tell the players that the script is done. “So, everything is done since that moment against Newcastle that prepared us to, at this moment, give Josh his moment and his credit and his flowers. “We can talk about whatever people want to talk about, like ‘penalties, it’s easy.’ It’s how we got to penalties. Altay [Bayindir] saved the penalty [in normal time] from Martin Odegaard who hadn’t missed one in his professional career yet. “Then Josh, in a moment of pressure with everything he’s been through in his mind, steps up and gives us the win.” Our first home game of the year is up next #MUFC || #PL — Manchester United (@ManUtd) January 14, 2025 Southampton head coach Ivan Juric, meanwhile, has suggested that his team need to be active in the transfer window in order to remain in the Premier League. Asked about whether they would bring anyone in, he said: “I hope so. I think we need some players in some positions. “We will see in these last 20 days what will happen. My idea is that we need some players who can improve the level of the squad a little bit. “For me, all the good players have to stay here and, if it’s possible, to bring another to be more competitive.” PLAYERS TO WATCH Manchester United – Bruno Fernandes United captain Fernandes has scored seven goals in all competitions, including his side’s only goal in the 1-1 draw against Arsenal in the FA Cup last weekend. The Portuguese is also tied with Marcus Rashford as the Red Devils’ top goalscorer in the Premier League on four. Only four attackers (attacking midfielders, wingers or strikers), meanwhile, have made more progressive passes in open play than Fernandes (88). Southampton – Tyler Dibliing Dibling is one of three Southampton players who lead their Premier League scoring charts with two goals, while he also netted a brace in the 3-0 win over Swansea in the FA Cup on Sunday. The 18-year-old academy product has caught the eye so far in the campaign, also registering two assists and will be looking to impress at Old Trafford. MATCH PREDICTION: MANCHESTER UNITED WIN Manchester United come into this match unbeaten in their last 15 Premier League matches against Southampton, having outscored them 29 to 11 in that period. Amorim’s side are also coming into this match following back-to-back draws against league leaders Liverpool and third-placed Arsenal, who they beat on penalties in the FA Cup third round last weekend. The Red Devils have, however, lost each of their last three Premier League home games. They last lost more consecutively in February 1934 as a second tier side (five), while they last did so in the top-flight in October 1930 (six). Southampton were beaten 5-0 at home to Brentford in their last league game to make it 10 matches without a win (D2 L8). Saints have won just one league game all season (D3 L16) and are 10 points from safety after 20 matches. Southampton are also winless in their last 17 Premier League away games (D4 L13) – only between March 1985 and February 1986 have they had a longer run without a win on the road in the top-flight (19). They were beaten 3-0 by Manchester United at St Mary’s in September – a result that, at the time, was United’s only victory in six league games. OPTA WIN PROBABILITY Manchester United – 69% Draw – 17.2% Southampton – 13.8%",
