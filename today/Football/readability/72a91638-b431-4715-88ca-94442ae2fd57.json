  "text": "Nicolo Zaniolo scored against his former side as Atalanta defeated Roma 2-0 at Stadio Olimpico on Monday to make it eight Serie A wins in a row and move within one point of leaders Napoli. Marten de Roon opened the scoring in the 69th minute with a shot from the edge of the box that heavily deflected in off Zeki Celik, before substitute Zaniolo sealed the points in the final minute with a glancing header. Claudio Ranieri was taking charge of Roma on home soil for the first time since returning for a third spell in charge and saw his side start brightly, with Leandro Paredes testing Marco Carnesecchi and Manu Kone firing just wide. Atalanta had an Ademola Lookman goal ruled out for offside before half-time as they started to assert a little more authority on the game. Artem Dovbyk was next to go close for Roma, forcing Carnesecchi into a good save, but Atalanta captain De Roon found the breakthrough at the other end when his deflected shot wrong-footed Mile Svilar. Zaniolo then got his head to Juan Cuadrado’s corner for Atalanta’s second, which he did not hold back on celebrating with the travelling fans, as 15th-placed Roma were condemned to a fourth league loss in a row for the first time in 16 years. EIGHT IN A ROW! #RomaAtalanta pic.twitter.com/8UQPlAsiXf — Lega Serie A (@SerieA_EN) December 2, 2024 Data Debrief: Game goes way of the form book This is only the second time Atalanta have ever won eight Serie A matches in a row, having previously done so between February and July 2020. Roma’s form could not be any more contrasting, as they have lost four on the spin in the league for the first time since 2008 under Luciano Spalletti. I Giallorossi have now picked up just one point from their past four Serie A fixtures against Atalanta, losing four and drawing one of those encounters.",
