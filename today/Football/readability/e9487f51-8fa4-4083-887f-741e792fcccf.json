Walker spent the second half of last season on loan at AC Milan, who have decided not to make the deal permanent. The report has claimed that Turkish Super Lig giants Fenerbahce have ‘informed intermediaries of their interest in Walker’, according to the report, although they have yet to make an official bid for the Man City right-back. Fenerbahce’s Turkish rivals, Galatasaray, are also monitoring Walker. While Bayern Munich right-back Sacha Boey is Galatasaray’s first choice, the Turkish champions could move for Walker if a potential deal to re-sign the 24-year-old does not materialise. Walker is out of contract at Man City next summer.",
