  "text": "An emotional Ann-Katrin Berger took the blame for Germany’s semi-final exit to Spain at Euro 2025, saying she should have closed the space to deny Aitana Bonmati. Germany had put in a strong defensive performance as they forced the world champions to extra time at 0-0, but Bonmati netted a 113th-minute winner to send Spain into the final. The two-time Ballon d’Or Feminin winner superbly turned her marker before squeezing a low shot past Berger at her near post from near the right byline. Berger has made more saves than any other goalkeeper at the Euros this year (23), while she had saved each of her last 15 shots on target faced up until Bonmati’s winning goal. She was also pivotal for 10-player Germany in their quarter-final against France, making a stunning clawed save before saving two penalties in the shoot-out to send them into the last four. But even after another impressive personal performance between the sticks on Wednesday, she was disheartened by the result. “I take the blame on myself. The near corner must have been closed, absolutely,” a tearful Berger told ARD. “I can make as many saves as I want, but that should have been mine. I’m incredibly sorry for the team. “We’re really disappointed. A small mistake, one moment of not paying attention, and that’s all the more bitter. It’s just disappointing.” As for Spain, they will face England in a second consecutive major final, having beaten the Lionesses in the 2023 World Cup final. Spain sealed their place in what will be their first-ever Euros final, with 2025 being just the second showpiece in the last nine editions to see a first-time finalist (also in 2017, with both Denmark and the Netherlands doing so). It was also their first win over Germany in nine attempts (D3 L5 previously), and Wednesday’s triumph saw them end a run of four competitive games without a goal against them. La Roja are now looking to add the Euros title to their collection, having won the World Cup and Nations League in the last two years, and Mariona Caldentey is confident they can lift the trophy. “It’s something we have never won,” Caldentey told BBC Sport. “It’s something we are missing, and we really want it as a team. “That was our focus from the first day. We are really close, it’s just one step more, one game more, and we are ready for that. “It will be a hard game. It’s a final, so they are dangerous even though they can’t maybe play the greatest football yet, but they have it inside them. It will be a hard but good game. “With this team, you feel everything is possible. We have a really strong team. We are just ready, and we have the ambition to win. I think this is the year. Why not? We respect England, but we will go for it.”",
