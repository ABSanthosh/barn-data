  "text": "While Arsenal might have mounted a second-half comeback at Craven Cottage, the Gunners did watch their Premier League title dreams take another blow. Watching Raul Jimenez produce a clinical finish after just 11 minuets and handing Fulham a shock lead in west London, Marco Silva’s men certainly caused Arsenal some real headaches. Although French defender William Saliba might have grabbed Mikel Arteta’s side an equaliser just moments after the half-time break, Arsenal will be ruing a missed opportunity here. Failing to extend on their recent four-match winning run and make up any serious ground on runaway leaders Liverpool, the Gunners still find themselves sat six points adrift of top spot. However, there was some last-gasp drama as England international Bukayo Saka saw his header ruled out by VAR as Gabriel Martinelli was offside in the build-up. On an afternoon when Arsenal once again demonstrated their inconsistencies, we have taken a look at the main talking points from Craven Cottage. Arsenal’s title dreams suffer a major blow Marking their return from November’s international break in the midst of a real purple patch, Arsenal travelled across the capital on Sunday afternoon desperate to extend on their recent charge. With Liverpool’s trip to bitter local rivals Everton called off on Saturday due to the severe weather conditions across England, the Gunners knew the importance of making up some crucial ground. Ending the weekend fixtures still sat third in the standings, Arteta’s side also find themselves chasing a six-point deficit and with Liverpool holding a game in hand. Heading into November’s fortnight interval with a 1-1 stalemate at Stamford Bridge, Arsenal have won just a trio of their previous eight Premier League appearances and their title ambitions could have taken a critical blow here. Although Arteta might have been quick to play down his side’s recent inconsistencies on the domestic stage, Sunday’s guests now face a real uphill challenge on their hands. Fulham extend on their European charge While most of Sunday’s attention from Craven Cottage might be stolen by Arsenal’s missed opportunity, Fulham certainly deserve plenty of plaudits for what was another eye-catching performance in west London. Making a real statement earlier in the week as they stormed their way to a 3-1 victory at home against Brighton, Marco Silva’s men find the mood in their camp at a red-hot high. Heading into November’s international break with a 2-0 win away at Crystal Palace, the former Everton boss is suddenly dreaming of the chance to mount a genuine European charge this season. Suffering just a single defeat from any of their previous seven Premier League appearances – a run that stems back to October 19th – Fulham will be desperate to spring another upset when they travel to Anfield next weekend. Although the Cottagers might still be waiting to record a maiden Premier League clean sheet at Craven Cottage, Sunday’s hosts will take a string of positives away from what has been a stellar start. The Gunners are still seeking defensive stability Although Arsenal might have found a sensational boost when returning from November’s fortnight interval, the Gunners are still seeking some crucial defensive stability. Despite claiming a 2-0 win against historic rivals Manchester United earlier in the week, Arteta’s camp have recorded just a pair of clean sheets from any of their previous eight appearances across all fronts. Likewise, despite signing off November with an action-packed 5-2 victory against West Ham, Sunday’s guests have now failed to record a single clean sheet on their travels since a 3-0 win away at Championship outfit Preston on October 30th. Failing to muster back-to-back clean sheets across any competition since the middle of September, Arteta’s side must dust themselves down quickly as they turn their attention back to Champions League duties on Wednesday night.
