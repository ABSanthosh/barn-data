  "text": "Regis Le Bris urged his Sunderland team to show more ruthlessness in front of goal after falling to a 1-0 defeat against Primeira Liga champions Sporting CP. Sunderland concluded their pre-season training camp in Portugal with a narrow defeat, decided by Francisco Trincao’s strike in the 11th minute of the contest. The Black Cats impressed in the first half, though, with Eliezer Mayenda posing a considerable threat up front and seeing an effort deflect narrowly over the crossbar. Mayenda then had a glorious chance to level the game midway through the first 45 minutes, but was unable to hit the target following an inch-perfect cross from Enzo Le Fee. As was the case in Saturday’s draw with Sevilla, Le Bris fielded two almost completely different teams in either half, with Sporting dominating the contest after the break. Sunderland’s starting line-up featured summer signings Habib Diarra, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi and Simon Adingra as they all got more valuable minutes in the tank. Another good pre-season workout, but it ends in defeat to @SportingCP. pic.twitter.com/L7w4Gil780 — Sunderland AFC (@SunderlandAFC) July 21, 2025 With a trip to Hearts next on the agenda for the Premier League new boys, Le Bris remains encouraged by the team’s progress, but called for more of a cutting edge. “It was two different halves again because we split the group,” Le Bris said following the full-time whistle. “We wanted to give them two 45 minutes each. The intentions were good again, and the energy of the squad was really interesting. “We struggled a bit in the first half and conceded a goal with the only opportunity they had. “It is better to make that mistake right now so we can understand how we want to defend against this kind of squad. “They were mature, well-organised, and had many different options – through the middle and in behind. “It is good to manage this kind of problem early in the season. We created some good chances, but unfortunately we didn’t score. “It is really important now that when you’re creating chances, you are clinical as well, because that will be key this season. “I am happy with the energy and happy with the way we created some chances, but in the end, we have to score.” Another Premier League side in action on Monday was Brighton, who concluded their respective pre-season campaign in Spain with a 2-0 win over LaLiga side Las Palmas. After comfortably beating Stoke City last week, Fabian Hurzeler’s side continued their winning momentum thanks to first-half strikes from Matt O’Riley and Yasin Ayari. The result came at a cost, though, with midfielder Facundo Buonanotte limping off 10 minutes in the second half, with goalscorer Ayari coming back on to replace him. We rounded off our pre-season training camp in Spain with a comfortable 2-0 win over Las Palmas thanks to goals from Yasin Ayari and Matt O’Riley. — Brighton \u0026 Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC) July 21, 2025",
