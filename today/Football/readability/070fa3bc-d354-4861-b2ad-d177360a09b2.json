United were beaten at Stamford Bridge by Marc Cucurella’s 71st-minute header, but the visitors did have their chances of snatching a result against the Blues. Harry Maguire saw his first-half strike ruled out for offside by VAR, with Mason Mount firing narrowly wide after the break before Amad Diallo forced Robert Sanchez into a save. But the Red Devils were only able to generate an expected goals (xG) total of just 0.4 from their five attempts as their Premier League woes stooped to another low. Indeed, this was United’s 18th league defeat, their most in a campaign since losing 20 in 1973-74, the last season in which they were relegated. They have also gone eight league games without a win (D2 L6) for the first time since an 11-game stretch between December 1989 and February 1990. It was Amorim’s second run of losing three consecutive Premier League matches since taking charge of United, one fewer streak of three consecutive defeats than Alex Ferguson had across his 810 games in the competition (three). 0.92 – Ruben Amorim has won 24 points in 26 Premier League games, a points per game ratio of 0.92. This is lower than Paul Jewell’s Premier League points per game (0.94), who managed 24 winless games at Derby when they finished on 11 points in 2007-08. Concerning. pic.twitter.com/ncNV2wHUF6 — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) May 16, 2025 However, the United boss was in a surprisingly positive mood ahead of their season-defining Europa League final against Tottenham next Wednesday. “I think we started great, well, but in the final third we needed to be a bit more aggressive. We were there, we faced the game in the right way,” Amorim said. “It was a bit of bad luck today. Sometimes we want to press and to score a goal, but we lost a little bit of concentration. “It was different, but you never like when you lose the game. We were competitive, that was clear. “We have to prepare for each competition, with five days, we can rest. We have to prepare [for the Europa League final], two days to recover and then two days to prepare. “In the end, I looked at all the players and I think they are OK. Of course, we are excited to be in the final. “Since day one, the pressure has been there, but I live quite well with the pressure. When you have the final of any cup, we show up, so we are prepared for that.”",
