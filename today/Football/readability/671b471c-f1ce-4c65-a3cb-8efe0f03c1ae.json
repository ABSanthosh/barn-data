  "text": "Verdict: Liverpool win \u0026 Under 4.5 goals Best Odds: 4/5 Bookmaker: Dachbet Hoping to widen their buffer at the top of the Premier League table, Liverpool will travel to St. Mary’s on Sunday afternoon. Southampton Starting with the hosts, while Southampton might have put a maiden Premier League victory on the board earlier in the month as they clinched a 1-0 win against Everton, Russell Martin’s men came crashing back down to earth last time out. Putting in another worrying performance as they fell to a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Wolves, the former Swansea boss has an abundance of pressure on his shoulders at St. Mary’s. Although the Saints might have made their Premier League return this season, they are pencilled in as a landslide relegation contender. Marking their return from November’s international break sat rock-bottom of the table, Southampton couldn’t have asked for a tougher challenge this weekend. Hit with a 3-0 drumming when they last met Liverpool back on February 28th, Martin’s side have also claimed just a single point from any of their previous five Premier League meetings. Team News Not making a single appearance across any competition since the start of October, Southampton look set to once again be without Scotland international Ross Stewart. However, Martin’s side are hopeful that former Bournemouth star Ryan Fraser will be able to return this weekend. Finding the net on his senior England debut last weekend, ex-Manchester City starlet Taylor Harwood-Bellis will start at the heart of Southampton’s defence. While summer recruit Cameron Archer might have notched just a pair of Premier League goals since arriving at St. Mary’s, the 22-year-old should keep his spot leading the line. Liverpool As for the visitors, while many around Anfield might have been heartbroken over the summer following Jurgen Klopp’s farewell, Liverpool have embarked on a sensational rise since Arne Slot’s arrival. With the mood around the red half of Merseyside at a red-hot high, they mark their return from November’s international break holding a five-point buffer over the chasing pack. Continuing to receive a string of plaudits from across the continent, Sunday’s guests are firing on all cylinders. Heading into the fortnight interval with a 2-0 victory at home against Aston Villa, the former Feyenoord boss has seen his squad muster 28 points from their first 11 Premier League appearances. With many billing Liverpool as a genuine title contender this season, Slot’s high-flying squad should be relishing a trip to St. Mary’s this weekend. Team News While Virgil van Dijk might have withdrawn from internal duties with the Netherland’s last week, Liverpool are hopeful that their influential skipper will be able to feature against his former club here. However, dealing with a hamstring issue prior to November’s fortnight break, Trent Alexander-Arnold is not expelled to be risked this weekend. Already notching eight Premier League goals so far this season, attacking talisman Mohamed Salah will play a leading role at St. Mary’s. Number one goalkeeper Alisson Becker remains on the sidelines with a hamstring injury and will once again be deputised by Irish shot-stopper Caoimhin Kelleher. Key Factors to Consider When Southampton and Liverpool last met back on February 28th, the Reds collected a 3-0 EFL Cup victory at Anfield. Liverpool have collected 13 points from their last five Premier League meetings against Sunday’s hosts. Slot’s high-flying squad have collected 28 points from their first 11 Premier League appearances so far this season. Southampton have put just a single Premier League victory on the board. Each of the last five meetings between Southampton and Liverpool have finished with over 2.5 goals. Conclusion Firing on all cylinders since opening up the new campaign, Liverpool should be smelling another golden opportunity here. Marking their return from November’s international break holding a five-point buffer at the top of the table, Sunday’s guests will be relishing a trip to St. Mary’s this weekend. Storming their way to a 3-0 romp when they welcomed Southampton to Anfield for an EFL Cup tie on February 28th, they are rightfully pencilled in as a standout contender on the south coast. Verdict: Liverpool win \u0026 Under 4.5 goals Best Odds: 4/5 Bookmaker: Dachbet",
