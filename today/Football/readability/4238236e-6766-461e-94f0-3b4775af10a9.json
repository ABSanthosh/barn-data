  "text": "Claiming London bragging rights on Sunday afternoon, Mikel Merino’s first-half header was enough to drag Arsenal to a 1-0 victory against Chelsea. Doing all of the early pressing and almost carving the Blues apart, Mikel Arteta’s side took a deserved lead after 20 minutes as Merino glanced on a curling corner from Martin Odegaard past a stretching Robert Sanchez. However, still dealing with an attacking crisis at the Emirates, Arsenal failed to build on their early lead as they struggled to find any real fluidity in the final third. Chelsea were almost handed a free ticket back into the game minutes before the interval as Marc Cucurella’s driven effort slipped through David Raya’s clutches and narrowly rolled past the post. In a contest where golden opportunities were often hard to come by, Arsenal managed to cling onto a first Premier League win since February 15th. Sunday’s 1-0 victory has moved the Gunners 12 points adrift of runaway leaders Liverpool as they enter March’s international break. As for Chelsea, while the Blues might still be clinging onto their spot in the Champions League places, they have now collected just two points from any of their last seven top-flight showdowns away from Stamford Bridge. On a Sunday afternoon when Arsenal dragged themselves to London bragging rights, we have taken a look at the main talking points from the Emirates. Arsenal claim a domestic boost Booking their Champions League quarter-final spot earlier in the week as they claimed a sensational 9-3 aggregate win against Dutch outfit PSV, it is no secret that Arsenal have placed all of their eggs in the European basket. However, sat 12 points adrift of runaway leaders Liverpool and watching their Premier League title dreams go up in smoke for another season, Arteta’s squad would have been relived to claim a domestic boost here. Heading into Sunday’s showdown at the Emirates without a win from any of their previous three Premier League appearances, the Gunners had some serious pressure on their shoulders here. Picking up just a second victory against Premier League opposition since a famous 5-1 romp against soon-to-be former champions Manchester City on February 2nd, Arsenal will simply be hoping to find some stability when they return from March’s fortnight break. Arteta’s side won’t be seen again in Premier League action until April 1st when they welcomed Fulham to the Emirates for another local derby. Chelsea’s nightmare rut on the road continues While Chelsea might have come flying out of the traps following Enzo Maresca’s arrival arrival at Stamford Bridge last summer, Sunday’s guests have come crashing back down to earth over the past couple of months. Despite still clinging onto their spot in the top-four, the former Leicester boss has come under some mounting scrutiny around west London. Watching their FA Cup adventure come to an end on February 8th thanks to a 2-1 loss away at Brighton, Chelsea have gained an unwanted reputation for their glaring issues on the road. In fact, on what has become a record-breaking rut outside of west London, the Blues have lost all of their previous five consecutive away fixtures against Premier League opposition across all competitions. Failing to claim a boost before heading into March’s international break, Maresca’s squad have also registered just a pair of points from their last seven consecutive Premier League showdowns away from Stamford Bridge. Merino is Arsenal’s saviour again While Arsenal might have welcomed back Brazilian international Gabriel Martinelli back from a muscle injury ahead of schedule this month, the Gunners are still dealing with a public injury crisis in north London. With Bukayo Saka still sidelined after undergoing hamstring surgery during the festive period, Arteta’s side have also confirmed that both Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus will miss the remainder of the season. Shockingly not bringing in a new number nine during the January transfer window, Merino has done a stellar job of leading the line in what has been an incredibly unorthodox role for the ex-Real Sociedad midfielder. Bagging the first-half winner here thanks to what was a smart flicked header, the Spanish international has rightfully received a string of praise from Arteta. Notching a brace away at Leicester on February 15th and dragging the Gunners to a 2-0 victory, Merino has now notched four goals in his previous seven appearances across all competitions.
