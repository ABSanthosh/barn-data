  "text": "Enzo Maresca defended Robert Sanchez after his mistake during Chelsea’s 3-1 victory over Wolves, insisting the goalkeeper has saved the Blues more times than not. The Blues recorded their first win in six Premier League games, while leapfrogging Newcastle United and Manchester City to return to the Premier League’s top four. After Tosin Adarabioyo broke the deadlock, Maresca’s side were pegged back in first-half stoppage time when Sanchez spilled Matheus Cunha’s corner, allowing Matt Doherty to pounce on the loose ball and prod in the equaliser. It was the former Brighton goalkeeper’s fourth error leading to a goal in the Premier League this season, with only Ipswich Town’s Arijanet Muric (five) recording more. Nevertheless, Sanchez retains the full confidence of the Blues head coach. “You said it was the fourth mistake [leading to a goal]? How many times did he save us? More than four, so no problem,” Maresca told Sky Sports. “It happens. Mistakes happen to him, the strikers, the midfielders. He is doing well.” Home W.#CFC | #CHEWOL pic.twitter.com/0VDI3McbKM — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) January 20, 2025 On the victory, he added: “In the last five games, we didn’t win, but I said many times that the performance was there. We created many chances, but didn’t score. Tonight, we finally scored and got three goals. “The first 40 minutes, we were top. The performance was excellent and we dominated the game. We scored and created many more chances. “Then, in the last five minutes [of the first half], what has been happening in the last five games happened again. Wolves had a little bit of confidence and got their goal, and then we started to struggle a little bit. “[In the] second half, we started quite well and then after the second and third goals, we were in control.” Meanwhile, Wolves remain 17th and only outside the relegation zone on goal difference after suffering a third straight defeat. And head coach Vitor Pereira insists his side must improve their “tactical maturity”. “We faced a strong team with players that, one against one, can create chances. We started the game not in the way that I like. We defended too much in the low block. “We conceded two goals from set-pieces, and a goal that we cannot concede. We need to improve tactical maturity. “The worst moment of our game is when we are defending in the last third. When we are defending in front of our box, this is a problem for us.”",
