Having secured a goalless draw in the first leg, the Gers were undone by Oihan Sancet’s penalty and Nico Williams’ thumping header in a 2-0 defeat at San Mames. Gers legend Ferguson has been in interim charge since Philippe Clement was sacked at the start of March. With their season essentially done, Ferguson wants to try and restore some pride and to see the Ibrox outfit competing once again after a dismal Scottish Premiership campaign. In quotes reported by BBC Sport, Ferguson said: “Where this leaves me now is that I’m going to finish the season as strongly as possible. “I’ve not sat down and talked about [my future] – but it needs to get sorted soon because, as a club, we need to do a lot of work. “The club needs to get back challenging. I just want my club to get back to where it should be, whether it’s me or someone else. “I was enjoying myself, but I got an opportunity not many people get. I would have been crazy to knock it back. “All I was focused on was making sure the three months were as enjoyable as possible. “My main objective is to make sure we get the club back to a strong position because this season has been way off what is required.” Barry Ferguson spoke to @RangersTV after tonight’s match against Athletic Club. pic.twitter.com/5muiXBc6rT — Rangers Football Club (@RangersFC) April 17, 2025 Rangers are 15 points adrift of Celtic with only five games left to play in the league, having also lost the Scottish League Cup final to their rivals. A dismal defeat to Queen’s Park in the Scottish Cup was one of the final nails in Clement’s coffin and the loss to Athletic means their season is ending with a whimper. Ferguson added: “(I’m) obviously disappointed. The work rate was there but the quality wasn’t. “It’s going to hurt. We need to go away and reflect a bit before finishing the season as strongly as possible. “The players are disappointed because they know the qualities we’ve got. It’s the quality in the middle third and final third we didn’t quite get right. “I want them to hurt because I’m hurting. The main thing for me is they need to come in on Monday and finish the season as strongly as possible.”",
