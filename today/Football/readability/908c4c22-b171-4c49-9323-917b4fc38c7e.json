The reporter has claimed that Bijol is currently one of the ‘hottest names’ on the list of the West Yorkshire club. Udinese are willing to sell Bijol this summer, but the Italian club are looking for around €20million for the 26-year-old Slovenia international central defender. Bijol has been on the books of Udinese since the summer of 2022 when he joined from CSKA Moscow in a €4million deal. Leeds will play in the Premier League next season after winning automatic promotion from the Championship. The Whites are expected to be busy this summer, as they aim to improve their current squad and make a strong impact in the top flight of English football.",
