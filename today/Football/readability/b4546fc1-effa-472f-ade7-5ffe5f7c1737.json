  "text": "Mohamed Salah believes he could play until he is 40 years old, having enjoyed his most productive campaign yet as Liverpool won the Premier League title. Salah was named Premier League Player of the Season as well as winning the competition’s Golden Boot and Playmaker awards for 2024-25, as Arne Slot’s first campaign at Anfield ended in glory. The Egyptian became the first player to win all three prizes in the same campaign, as well as tying the record for most combined goals and assists in a Premier League season. With 29 goals and 18 assists, he matched the 47 goal involvements recorded by Andy Cole in 1993-94 and Alan Shearer the following season. Both of those players required 42 matches to hit that tally, with Salah taking the record for a 38-game Premier League campaign. Salah, who turns 33 next month, was at one stage expected to quit Liverpool for the Saudi Pro League at the end of the campaign, only to pen a new two-year contract in April. And he believes he could have as many as seven or eight more seasons in him, telling ON Sports: “I will stop playing when I have that feeling. “If you ask me for my opinion, I think I can play until the age of 39 or 40, but if I felt before that I wanted to stop, I would quit. I have achieved a lot of things. “My contract was up at Liverpool and I would have gone to Saudi, but we finalised the deal with Liverpool.” Salah also tied the record for most goals scored by a player aged 30 or older in a single Premier League season, matching Didier Drogba’s haul for Chelsea in 2009-10. He did fall short of his best goalscoring campaign in the competition, having netted 32 times in 2017-18, though his 18 assists were five more than his previous high of 13 in 2021-22.",
