  "text": "Competition: LigaPro Market: Orense win Odds: 19/20 @ 1xBet Looking to make an immediate return to winning ways in the early hours of Tuesday, Orense will welcome Macara to the Estadio de Mayo. Starting with the hosts, left disappointed last time out as they eventually fell to a 1-0 loss away at Emelec, Orense are seeking an immediate response here. Nevertheless, still opening the midweek fixtures sat in the top-six, Santiago Escobar’s men have won each of their other three LigaPro appearances and they will certainly be excited to make a return to home soil in the early hours of Tuesday. Knowing that they could move into bronze medal position, El Verde have suffered just a single defeat since the end of April. Last seen at the Estadio de Mayo claiming a 2-1 victory against Aucas, the one-time Bolivar boss has seen his squad gain a reputation for their rugged success in front of their own supporters. Along with landing consecutive top-flight wins on home soil, Orense have also registered nine points from their last four showdowns in Machala. Likewise, continuing on from last season, Tuesday’s hosts have lost just a sole matchups at the Estadio de Mayo since the start of November. As for the visitors, while Macara might have opened up the 2025 campaign with back-to-back victories, the Sky Blues have largely come crashing back down to earth. Throwing away the lead twice last time out as they signed off May with a 2-2 stalemate at home against Manta, Alex Pallares’ side have registered just a sole LigaPro win from any of their previous 13 straight appearances – a rut that stems all the way back to February 22nd. Opening Tuesday’s showdown sat in the relegation zone and three points adrift of top-flight safety, the former Bilbao Athletic boss should be bracing himself for a stern examination here. Recording just a pair of wins outside of Ambato over the past 10 months, Macara should also be concerned by their most recent trip to the Estadio de Mayo. In fact, along with slumping to a 1-0 defeat when they travelled to Orense last season, they have also notched just a sole point from any of their previous three trips. Bet: Orense 19/20 to beat Macara in Tuesday’s LigaPro battle @ 1xBet",
