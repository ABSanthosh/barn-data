  "text": "Chelsea maintained their three-point lead at the top of Women’s Champions League Group B with a comfortable 6-1 victory over Dutch side FC Twente. The Blues, who had already booked their place in the quarter-finals, continued their 100% record under Sonia Bompastor, extending their winning streak to 14 matches in all competitions. Chelsea were ahead inside two minutes at Stamford Bridge through Catarina Macario’s looped volley over Olivia Clark following a poor giveaway in midfield by Lieske Carleer. But Twente restored parity soon after Maika Hamano brought down Charlotte Hulst in the box, with Kayleigh van Dooren stepping up from 12 yards to coolly convert. However, the visitors’ joy was short-lived. Mayra Ramirez combined with Oriane Jean-Francois less than a minute later, with the latter firing home with the aid of a deflection. Ramirez notched Chelsea’s third with a brilliant effort from distance with Clark off her line before Erin Cuthbert marked her 50th appearance in the competition with a goal. The Blues increased their advantage two minutes after the break through Sjoeke Nusken’s glanced header after being picked out by Hamano’s clipped delivery. Eve Perisset rounded off the scoring with a finish into the bottom corner, with the Blues now turning their focus to Leicester City in the Women’s Super League. Bompastor’s side finished the contest with a mammoth 4.68 expected goals (xG) total from their 29 efforts, compared to Twente’s 1.43 from 10 attempts. MASSIVE WIN AT THE BRIDGE! #UWCL pic.twitter.com/iQcqzUBe35 — Chelsea FC Women (@ChelseaFCW) December 11, 2024 In the lowest-scoring match of Wednesday’s action, Celtic remain without a win in the competition after five games after being comfortably beaten 3-0 by Real Madrid in Group B. With progression in the competition not possible, Elena Sadiku’s side were playing for pride and history, in search of their first ever group-stage point. But those hopes were dented in the 30th minute when Signe Bruun took aim from distance and curled a wonderful effort beyond the grasp of Kelsey Daugherty from distance. The Celtic goalkeeper had been beaten seconds before by Caroline Weir, but the Scotland international was denied a goal in her homeland by the offside flag. Their dominance deserved to be reflected in the scoreline, and Bruun’s bullet header from three yards out provided the comfort Madrid’s play at New Douglas Park merited. Substitute Alba Redondo then sealed the win five minutes from time, heading the ball into the bottom right corner after being picked out by Sheila Garcia inside the box. Los Blancos, along with Chelsea, have now confirmed their place in the quarter-finals with a game to spare, and did so comfortably, having restricted Celtic to an xG of 0.07. pic.twitter.com/58KltVG4hw — Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadridfem) December 11, 2024 In Group A, Wolfsburg joined Lyon in the quarter-finals of the competition after thumping Roma 6-1, with substitute Sveindis Jonsdottir scoring four goals at the AOK Stadion. Alexandra Popp sensationally curled the hosts into a sixth-minute lead, but Wolfsburg were pegged back when Valentina Giacinti capitalised on a mistake at the back to level. Popp then turned provider for Lineth Beerensteyn to restore Wolfsburg’s advantage nine minutes later before Jonsdottir notched her first of the game with a well-taken finish. The Iceland international then scored a further three times in seven minutes late on, concluding the scoring with a sweeping strike between the legs of Camelia Ceasar. And Wolfsburg were worthy of their win. They accumulated an xG total of 2.15 from their 23 shots, with Jonsdottir contributing a team-high 0.76.

The visitors found themselves in front in the 24th minute through Ada Hegerberg’s header, before Sara Dabritz smashed Lyon two in front after Eda Karatas’ poor clearance. Jazmin Wardlow then turned through her own net before the break, as Wendie Renard put the result beyond doubt after heading home Selma Bacha’s inviting corner kick. Danielle van de Donk’s low finish increased Lyon’s advantage before the Dutch midfielder teed up substitute Eugenie Le Sommer to complete the rout in Turkey.",
