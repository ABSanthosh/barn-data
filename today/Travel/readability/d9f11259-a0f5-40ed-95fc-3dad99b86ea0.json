  "description": "Bamse was more than a mascot onboard the Norwegian minesweeper Thorodd during World War II. As a registered crew member, this dog served alongside his fellow sailors and was known for his bravery in battle. He would stand guard in the front gun tower and not move until hostilities were over, never cowering below deck. This inspired the crew so much they had a special tin helmet made for him to wear. In 2006, a bronze statue of Bamse was erected in the Scottish town of Montrose, where he was stationed throughout the war. The Royal Norwegian Navy Museum (Marinemuseet) at Horten later planned to install a smaller bronze version in Honningsvåg, Bame’s hometown. Media attention had renewed interest in Bamse in Norway, sparking a successful fundraiser to install a duplicate of the Montrose statue. In 2009, schoolchildren from both Honningsvåg and from Montrose unveiled the statue at the Honningsvåg harbour Bamse was such a beloved crew member and companion onboard the Thorodd that he now has two statues. The Montrose statue faces northeast toward Honningsvåg, and the Honningsvåg statue faces southwest toward Montrose and Scotland.",
