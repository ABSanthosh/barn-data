  "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-seven-headed-palm-tree-of-cachiche",
  "description": "Hidden in Cachiche, a village locally renowned for its legends of witchcraft, stands the “Palmera de Siete Cabezas” (Seven-headed Palm Tree), a bizarrely-shaped palm that carries an ominous prophecy. Unlike ordinary palms, this wizened tree has grown in a twisted formation, as if it were a petrified serpent with multiple “heads” spread across the ground rather than reaching skyward. According to local legend, a 106-year-old witch prophesied on her deathbed that the city of Ica would face destruction when the palm’s seventh head fully grew. Since then, locals periodically prune this seventh head to prevent a catastrophe. Some claim the prophecy was fulfilled in 1998, when the seventh head was allegedly left uncut. That year, the city of Ica suffered a great flood caused by “El Niño”, a meteorological phenomenon that typically brings heavy rainfall and floods across the Peruvian coast, but rarely to Ica itself. Today, the tree itself is a popular site for those attracted to the haunting story and shape of this tree. Also, many travelers simply go to count the heads of the palm tree for themselves. Nearby, there is a park that honors the town’s heritage of curanderas (healers) and witches, including Julia Hernández Pecho, the woman said to be the one that made the prophecy about the seven-headed palm.",
