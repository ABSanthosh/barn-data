Researching his family’s upcoming all-inclusive vacation — he has been to a handful of such resorts in the past — prompted Mr. Gunter, who works in the entertainment industry, to compile spreadsheets of hundreds of resorts categorized by rates, ratings, location, food, beaches, activities, party vibes, adult-only or kid-friendly, and teen clubs. (His latest spreadsheet is posted on Reddit.)“I go to an all-inclusive for the sun and a cold piña colada in the pool,” he said.But you may want a different experience. Thankfully, the number of all-inclusives has risen dramatically in recent years, with concerted efforts to improve quality, increase activities and offer more value to the fixed rates.Here are some things to consider before booking your all-inclusive stay.What kind of vacation do you want?Are you traveling with family, or adults only? Is a nice beach sufficient, or do you want days full of activities? Are you planning to stay on the property or go exploring off-site? How old are your children?Answers to these questions will help you whittle down the many options.In 2024, the number of all-inclusive resorts worldwide jumped to 2,200, a 32-percent increase from 1,500 in 2021, according to Jan Freitag, the national director of hospitality analytics for CoStar, a global provider of real estate data and news. Mexico and the Caribbean offer the most, he said. Hilton alone plans to add 40 more properties in Mexico to the 100 the company already has in its portfolio.Club Med, which started the all-inclusive resort concept in the 1950s, now offers more than 60 properties around the world, including ski destinations in Quebec and Europe.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
