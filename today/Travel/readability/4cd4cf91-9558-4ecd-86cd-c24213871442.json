  "description": "A working pharmacy might seem like an unlikely place to find religious mosaics, but the counter at Farmacia del Puente in Santa Cruz de la Palma is home to several that would look right at home in a Byzantine cathedral. Since 1910, patrons have stopped by this spot nestled in La Palma not only to pick up medication, but also to admire the beautiful mosaics depicting the Saints Cosmas and Damian and their deeds. The connection between Saints Cosmas and Damian and the fields of pharmacy and medicine is deeply rooted in their legacy as compassionate healers. Renowned for their selfless dedication, they practiced medicine without charging a fee, earning them the title of anárgiros, or \"those without silver.\" Their lives exemplified an unwavering commitment to the physical and spiritual well-being of humanity, a legacy that continues to inspire modern healthcare professionals. Saints Cosmas and Damian are celebrated not only for their medical skills but also for their miraculous acts of healing. One of the most famous stories tells of how they successfully transplanted the leg from a corpse to a living patient suffering from gangrene. These supernatural accounts made them the patron saints of physicians, pharmacists, and surgeons, and their influence is felt wherever health and compassion intersect.",
