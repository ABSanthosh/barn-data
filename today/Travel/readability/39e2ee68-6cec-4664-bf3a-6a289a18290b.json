  "description": "First used in 1926 to host the second Grand Prix de la Marne, the circuit of Reims-Gueux consisted of a triangular layout of public roads, just east of Reims. Unlike its older, more-famous sibling at Le Mans, the Circuit de la Sarthe, there was no major section of the racetrack closed to regular traffic on non-race days. In the 1950s, the track layout went through both major and minor changes to comply with the increasing speed of race cars and motorcycles. After the last set of  changes in 1954, F1 went on sporadically for another 12 years until 1966, when the F1 French Grand Prix was held in Reims for the last time. Other racing continued for some years, but in 1972 Reims-Gueux closed permanently due to financial troubles. Despite more recent efforts to hold historic racing events, no official racing was seen at Reims-Gueux again. Today, the first two layouts of the track can still be driven on public roads. The later ones had a section of tarmac removed, which resolved in the road ending in the middle of a farmer's field, nearly 1,000 feet short of its intersection with the modern N31 at the Muizon Corner. The Amis of Reims-Gueux (Friends of Reims-Gueux) are a group of local enthusiasts dedicated to preserving the rich motorsport heritage and the already few remnants of the old circuit, saving them from destruction. Through events, restoration projects, and educational initiatives, they aim to keep the spirit of racing alive, celebrating both the thrilling competitions that took place and the community that formed around them. Their efforts ensure that the legacy of Reims-Gueux continues to inspire future generations of motorsport fans.",
