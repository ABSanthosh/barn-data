  "description": "The Golden State Model Railroad Museum is home to highly detailed models and dioramas of Central and Northern California towns, roundhouses, street scenes, and stations. Various types of freight and passenger trains, from steam to modern diesel, wind their way through the scenes. The museum was opened in 1985 to celebrate the impressive models made by the East Bay Model Engineers Society. The Society is one of the oldest modeling clubs in the United States, founded in 1933 in San Francisco. The group took special interest in electric trains and O-scale models, where 1/4 inch equals one foot. The 10,000 square foot exhibit features historic scenes including Donner Pass and the Oakland Mole.",
