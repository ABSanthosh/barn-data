  "description": "Many centuries ago, Old Goa was also called \"Cidade de Goa\" (City of Goa) or \"Goa Dourada\" (Golden Goa). It had two bustling suburbs called Daugim to the east and Panelim to the west, amongst others. Daugim, the eastern suburb, was home to the Madre De Deus Church, which was eventually shifted to Saligao in North Goa. Due to the presence of the church, Daugim was also referred to as \"Madre De Deus.\" The suburb was also the residence of Fidalgos (Portuguese aristrocrats). According to historical sources, the area was a community hub populated with many houses. Eventually, after capital was moved from Old Goa to Panaji in the 1840s,  Old Goa and its suburbs fell into neglect and disrepair. The Church of Madre De Deus moved from Daugim to Saligao. Today, Daugim is a largely deserted area and has been reduced to a memory from the past. However, some reminders of its once vibrant existence remain in the form of old relics and ruins dotting the area. One such marker is a memorial cross which stands on the side of the road connecting Old Goa to the village of Gandaulim. An inscription on the cross reads: \"Calcada De Daugim.\" \"Calcada\" translates to sidewalk or pavement or in some contexts, roadway. The location of this marker gives an idea of the location of this once thriving but now deserted suburb of Old Goa. The place lives on in memory by means of this marker.",
