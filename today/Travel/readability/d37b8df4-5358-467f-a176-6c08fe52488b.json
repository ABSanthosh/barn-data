  "description": "Political prisoners were held at this site in Taiwan as recently as the early 1990s. Now, the former prison is a reminder of the human rights abuses that took place during the White Terror, a period of political repression that begin in the 1950s and did not end until 1991. Another prison from the same period, now called Green Island Human Rights Culture Park, has also been designated as a museum and memorial site.   Every cell of the prison is open and in its original state, down to the fading padded walls, and documents and educational materials give visitors insight into the state of mind of prisoners who spent time incarcerated here.",
