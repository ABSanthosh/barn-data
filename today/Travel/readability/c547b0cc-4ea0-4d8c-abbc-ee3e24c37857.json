  "description": "One of the largest malls in Japan is the Aeon Mall Okinawa Lycoming. It is home to the 100-ton Rycom aquarium in an otherwise unassuming location for marine wildlife.  This 100-ton aquarium houses fish representing the region's native marine inhabitants. More than 1,000 fish representing dozens of species are located within the aquarium, along with spineless aquatic invertebrates like sea cucumbers and stars. The aquarium overlaps with the first-floor elevator, giving shoppers a chance to observe animals like the endangered Napoleon wrasse. Two-inch clownfish can be seen mingling with zebra sharks reaching nearly 14 feet in length, while massive moray eels swim alongside schools of damselfish and cardinalfish.  Staff from the nearby Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium care for the Rycom aquarium, ensuring the safety of endemic fish and quality of the mall facilities.",
