Above, passengers at the check-in area of BER international airport in Germany.Credit...Filip Singer/EPA, via ShutterstockMarch 21, 2025As Franck Verhaeghe and two friends planned a March trip to Mexico City, they plotted out not only where they would stay and which museums they would visit but also the language they would speak: French. “It’s not that I think it’s unsafe for Americans,” said Mr. Verhaeghe, 65, who lives in California, but “I can imagine people there aren’t very happy with us. So my friends and I decided that on this trip, we would all just speak French to each other.”Two months into his second term, President Trump has set off panic in Europe about the potential collapse of alliances; inspired boycotts of American products in Canada; heightened tensions between Denmark and Greenland over the island’s independence; and prompted protests in Istanbul and Panama over the possibility of U.S. territorial expansion.His proposals are also making some Americans reconsider their travel plans.ImageOne anxious American traveler planning a trip to France asked travelers on a Rick Steves’ Europe forum for insight into how the French were responding to American foreign policy changes.

A few days later, she grew more worried when “Trump and Musk began insulting NATO and allied countries.” She and her husband haven’t made any changes “at least for now,” but they are “hoping that travel doesn’t become more unsafe.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
