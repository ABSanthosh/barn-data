So the staff scrambled, offering the little dog 10 different options until she found a porcelain one she liked. And now that she’s a frequent guest, they store that bowl for her next visit.Gone are the days when hotel guests traveling with their dogs had to sneak them into their rooms or pack their own chew toys. The welcome mat is out, and many hotels are going all out to please four-legged guests. Some provide custom bedding, toys and fresh-cooked food. Many offer maps of nearby off-leash areas and pet-friendly restaurants. Others go further with dog-sitting, walks and even wilderness hikes.More vacationers than ever are bringing along their family pets. According to American Pet Products Association 2024 surveys, about nine out of 10 owners say they’ve traveled with their pet in the last year, compared with about eight out of 10 in the 2021-2022 study.Whenever Benji and her owner, a Florida businessman, stay at the NH Collection New York Madison Avenue, the staff always tries to book her “favorite room,” said Fredrick Jones, the rooms division and guest relations director at the hotel. Once, when there was construction near that room, employees showed Benji five other rooms, but the dog did not seem comfortable in any of them. Finally, they changed course, reopening the usual room. “Benji ran from corner to corner. She knew she was home,” Mr. Jones said.Walks (and hikes) that get tails waggingFor some travelers, pet care is becoming just as important as a pool or a spa in choosing a hotel. Some properties have staff dedicated to pets. Others tap outside professionals. Kimpton Hotels in the United States has teamed up with the dog care company Wag! for walks and day care. Guests at the Pan Pacific Hotel in London can ask the pet concierge to make arrangements for walks with Paws Galore Pet Sitters or a canine massage at Shoreditch Dog House. Other hotels provide lists of approved vendors for guests seeking pet care.At NUMU, a boutique hotel in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, Gustavo Vasquez, a food and beverage manager, also walks the hotel’s one or two canine guests each week at the nearby park. Like most hotel dog walkers, Mr. Vasquez sends a report card and photos to the owner after their outings. A one-hour walk is $30, with sitting services at $20 per hour for longer periods. If a visiting dog seems lonely in the room, Mr. Vasquez may take it (with the owner’s permission) to the rooftop bar to mingle or to hang out with him in his office.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
