Here’s What You Need to Know.What medications should you bring, what insurance do you need and how do you find a doctor? Here are health care tips if you’re traveling internationally.Credit...Weston WeiUpdated Exploring a new country can be exhilarating, but that excitement comes with risks. Most of the nearly 100 million Americans who traveled abroad in 2023 didn’t deal with anything more than stomach discomfort or a common cold. But what happens if you’re injured or get sick? How do you find a doctor, and who pays for your care?These tips can help you prepare for your trip, navigate health care systems in foreign countries and reduce chances you’ll get stuck with a giant bill.Not all medications are available, or welcome, overseasCertain medicines may be hard to find abroad. That’s why it’s smart to pack over-the-counter medicines for common conditions like travelers’ diarrhea, said Dr. Lin H. Chen, who directs the Mt. Auburn Hospital Travel Medicine Center, in Cambridge, Mass. Keep prescription medications in their original packaging to prove they’re yours. For any pre-existing conditions requiring medicine, it’s wise to carry a letter from your physician.Some countries have limitations on pharmaceuticals. For example, Adderall is not permitted in Japan. Also, certain medicines have different names abroad, like acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol), which is called paracetamol in many countries. Check individual U.S. Embassy pages on the State Department website for information about what medications you are allowed to bring, especially if you need to take them on a regular basis.Buy enough insurance for the worst-case scenarioBefore your trip, check your health coverage. “Most health care insurance providers don’t cover international medical, or it’s often restricted,” said Rupa Mehta, the chief executive of Squaremouth, which operates a digital marketplace for travel insurance, as well as offering policies.U.S. private insurance companies typically will not cover most medical expenses abroad, Ms. Mehta explained. The same goes for Medicare and Medicaid. Check with your provider; some may make exceptions for what they will cover.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
