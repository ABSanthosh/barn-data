Right: courtesy of the brandsI get up around 6:30 or 7. I go work out sometimes, or I get right in the shower after I play with my dogs. I use Olaplex, which I really love — it has changed my feeling about shampoo. The thing I’ve used since I was little is Erno Laszlo’s Sea Mud soap, a simple black bar soap. My mom still uses it, too. I go out a lot with towel-dried hair and a rubber band. If I use a dryer, which is infrequent, I put a little Dallas volumizing spray in my hair at the roots. I love my Dyson. I like saving time, and it dries my hair extremely quickly. I have this really incredible brush by Snow Fox Skincare. It has metal spikes, which doesn’t sound very friendly, but it is.I prefer unscented body care. Right now I have Clarins body lotion, but I also like Barbara Sturm’s. It’s that balance of being hydrating but not too oily. I don’t want to feel sticky all day. I have a natural deodorant that I love, called Corpus. And I’m pretty loyal to fragrances. I’ve been obsessed with scent for a very long time — my mom always had this great vanity of fragrances. I love our new one, Sublime. Partnering with Shiseido has been incredible; I would say we worked for two years on it. The alchemy of leather and rose and notes like osmanthus and vetiver make it addictive. It’s not feminine or masculine, which I find interesting. I don’t use a lot on my face. I’ve always loved the Guerlain orchid serum. One thing I found recently is the CosRx Snail Mucin Essence. I sometimes use a Murad matte lotion or Chanel face cream. I’m really vigilant about protecting my skin in the sun. I wear Shiseido sunscreen, and then I use an SPF spray by Kate Somerville. I play a lot of tennis, so it’s easy to reapply. I love an infrared blanket. I use the one from HigherDose at night right before I go to bed, and then I’ll take a quick shower. It’s like a form of meditation. There’s a woman who I see for lymphatic drainage massage — her name is Marina [Baratashvili]. And I’m going to Ricari Studios next week — I can’t wait.I feel like wearing too much makeup is aging. I mean, I like foundation, but with a little translucency. The base that I use is Armani, which has been discontinued. Everything I love is discontinued! It’s called Designer Lift Foundation, and it just has a finish that’s really natural. Versed’s Smooth Landing Advanced Retinoid Eye Balm is great to put under coverup. I like Nars’s Soft Matte Concealer, under the eyes and wherever I need it. I use a MAC blush called Dainty, which feels like you’re outside on a fresh day with cool air, and then add a little Guerlain bronzing powder. I do like eyeliner. I found a new one by Mally in Iced Plum because my other one was discontinued. A thicker pencil is great because you can blend it easier. And Armani mascara, called Eyes to Kill. I don’t wear a lot of lip color. One I’ve been using lately — I’m a creature of habit — is [a shade] called Sheer Petal, by Sisley. I love the Neutrogena makeup wipes at the end of the night or sometimes in the morning, if there’s still eye makeup left. I can’t live without them.This interview has been edited and condensed.Try ThisA New Collection of Bed Linens, Made to Mix and MatchImageThe new housewares brand Millaux debuts this month with a collection of made-to-order bedclothes.Credit...Isabel BrontsDuring her three-year tenure in Balenciaga’s creative department, Laura Tanzer had a front-row seat to the time-honored tradition of haute couture craftsmanship. Now, in partnership with her wife, the former professional tennis player Jessica Simpson, the Zurich-based Central Saint Martins graduate has extended that sartorial savoir faire to the home with Millaux, a new line of bedclothes. “We take such time to decide what to wear, but a lot of people overlook what they put on their beds,” says Simpson. Created in heritage Italian and Portuguese ateliers, the made-to-order range combines historical artistry with a playful opulence inspired by centuries-old chateaus. The initial offering includes jumbo-striped European flax linen sheets, jewel-toned Egyptian cotton sateen pillowcases and 610-thread-count orchid-dotted duvet covers dreamed up by the textile designer Fiona Blakeman, who has previously worked with the fashion designers Phoebe Philo and Grace Wales Bonner. Much like a collection of clothes, the 20 debut pieces, each of which is sold individually, are meant to be mixed and matched.

Now, in partnership with her wife, the former professional tennis player Jessica Simpson, the Zurich-based Central Saint Martins graduate has extended that sartorial savoir faire to the home with Millaux, a new line of bedclothes. “We take such time to decide what to wear, but a lot of people overlook what they put on their beds,” says Simpson. Created in heritage Italian and Portuguese ateliers, the made-to-order range combines historical artistry with a playful opulence inspired by centuries-old chateaus. The initial offering includes jumbo-striped European flax linen sheets, jewel-toned Egyptian cotton sateen pillowcases and 610-thread-count orchid-dotted duvet covers dreamed up by the textile designer Fiona Blakeman, who has previously worked with the fashion designers Phoebe Philo and Grace Wales Bonner. Much like a collection of clothes, the 20 debut pieces, each of which is sold individually, are meant to be mixed and matched. \u003cem\u003eFrom $190, \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.millaux.com/\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003emillaux.com\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr/\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"optimistic-truncator-a11y\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003chr/\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you for your patience while we verify access.
