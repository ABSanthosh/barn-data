The one he can’t stop thinking about is Marcello, a hidden shop in Fukuoka, Japan. “You walk into a nondescript building, go up a couple of flights of stairs to the rooftop, walk along a stone path, then go down a fire escape to this completely transporting clothing shop,” says Rowe. The designer has brought that spirit of discovery to Zebra Room, a boutique in Germantown, N.Y., that’s equal parts coffee shop, cabinet of curiosities and listening lounge. Housed in a converted barn, Zebra Room devotes most of its square footage to a collection of midcentury Scandinavian furniture that Rowe’s brother imports from Copenhagen (highlights include an Inca chair by Arne Norell). There are also secondhand clothes and goods, from vintage marinière shirts to handmade leather dog collars. A coffee bar (which serves everything from Mexican café de olla to cold brew tonics topped with yuzu) is set up in a cube leftover from an exhibition held by the shop’s next-door neighbors Alexander Gray Associates. Rowe and his wife, the interior designer Loren Daye, clad the plaster installation with hemlock wood to keep with the natural feel of the space, which also has a 1970s cast-iron stove and retains the barn’s bluestone dirt floors. The cube houses Rowe’s record collection and sound system, which the designer has modeled after those in Japan’s kissa cafes. He alternates between vinyl and streaming, but the shop’s soundtrack is always played through a restored vintage SunValley/Dynaco tube amplifier and Klipsch LaScala speakers; similar tube amps, turntables and speakers are also for sale. “I want it to feel like someone’s living room — you might have to yell over the music,” says Rowe. instagram.com/_zebra_room.See ThisBotanical Glassware on Display With de Gournay Wallpaper in LondonImageLeft: Sophie Lou Jacobsen’s alabaster urn, fused with three sculpted glass tulips, is shown in a room hung with de Gournay’s Jardin Chinois wallpaper. Right: a collection of Jacobsen’s bottles and vases with de Gournay’s Earlham wallpaper on silver gilded paper.Credit...Alexandra ShamisThis time last year, Harald Donoghue, the director of special projects at the British wallpaper maker de Gournay, sent Sophie Lou Jacobsen, a French American designer based in New York, a DM over Instagram. “I’d seen a picture of one of Sophie’s vases in a French magazine,” says Donoghue about why he decided to reach out. “I cut it out for my scrapbook.” Jacobsen specializes in glass pieces that are artistic and utilitarian, like vases and lighting, often made in collaboration with the glassblower Adam Holtzinger. Donoghue asked if Jacobsen would create a series inspired by de Gournay, whose wallpapers — all painted or embroidered by hand, taking months to manufacture — look like relics from earlier centuries. The resulting collection, Tulipa, features classical shapes that are typically made with porcelain, translated into glass, often with botanical detailing. To exhibit the new pieces, the de Gournay showroom in London has been transformed into a home using antiques sourced by the dealer Christopher Cawley: Visitors begin in a reception-style room hung with de Gournay’s Jardin Chinois pattern on persimmon-colored silk and Jacobsen’s amber pendant light with sculpted glass tulips. The makeshift foyer centers on a sepia-toned urn full of magnolia branches; in the bedroom is a bonbonnière, a candy dish with a leafy stem growing from the lid. “It’s like walking into another world,” says Jacobsen. “One that allows you to dream a little.” Tulipa is on view through Oct. 14, sophieloujacobsen.com.Go HereA Bed-and-Breakfast Overlooking the Harbor in Chania, CreteImageLeft: the Ontas mezzanine suite, one of seven bedrooms in the Aisha hotel located in the historic center of Chania, Crete. Right: the hotel’s terrace looks out over Chania’s harbor and the Sea of Crete.Credit...George Anastasakis/South Space for PhotographyEight years ago, Zaira Apostolaki Liokoura, the owner of a furniture shop, and her sister Dimitra Apostolaki Liokoura, a lawyer, bought two floors in a nearly 500-year-old dilapidated mansion overlooking the harbor of Chania, a port city on the Greek island of Crete, with a vision of opening a boutique hotel. Because the property was on the UNESCO-protected Kastelli Hill, it took more than five years to get the permits they needed (the interiors and building plans had to be examined by archaeologists), but the sisters were patient. “I spent that time dreaming and planning the interiors in my mind,” says Zaira. In the two years it took to renovate, the architectural team saved as many of the original elements as possible, from stucco carvings in the ceiling to tile pieces that were eventually reinstalled as a mosaic on the floor of the terrace. Last month, the property finally opened as Aisha, a seven-room bed-and-breakfast with marble floors and linen bedsheets made for the rooms by local artisans. While Zaira is passionate about design, she is equally obsessed with breakfast. “We source all the best Cretan products, from olives to cheeses, and coffee and bread from my favorite bakery, Red Jane,” she says.
