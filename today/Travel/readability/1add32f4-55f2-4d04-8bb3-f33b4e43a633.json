As a popular weekend destination (and bachelor/bachelorette hotspot), there are a lot of hotels here to choose from here. I’ve visited the city a handful of times over the years and stayed at some hotels that were really cool and unique. I’ve also stayed at some that aren’t worth your time (or money). Here’s a list of my favorite hotels in Nashville so you can plan your trip, have fun, and enjoy your time in the Music City: 1. The Russell This boutique property is housed in an all-brick church from the early 20th century. I love that they kept a lot of the original features, like the stained-glass windows, brick walls, and original pews (repurposed as headboards in the rooms). In keeping with the building’s history of supporting the East Nashville community, they donate a portion of the hotel’s proceeds to nonprofits that help those experiencing homelessness. That means that staying at The Russell for the weekend, for example, can provide someone in need with 16 nights of shelter. The Russell is a colorful property, with a bright lobby with high ceilings, eclectic furniture, and complimentary tea and coffee. Each of the 23 rooms features different decor (like local artwork) curated by one of Nashville’s most well-known designers. All rooms have the typical hotel amenities like a flatscreen TV, free toiletries, minifridge, Keurig coffee maker, desk, and even some unique perks like a noise machine and complimentary basket of local snacks. The bathrooms are colorfully tiled and have mirrors in the shape of church windows (a nice design touch). It’s a unique place to stay in East Nashville, a cool area of the city that’s packed with unpretentious (and great) restaurants, cutting-edge art galleries, and craft cocktail bars. If you’re on a road trip, there’s also a free parking spot right across the street. Book here!   2. Placemakr SoBro If you plan on staying in town for a while or want access to a kitchen, this hotel offers fully furnished studio, 1-, 2-, and 3-bedroom apartments. They all have an industrial chic design, with exposed pipes, tall ceilings, and colorful artwork on the walls. The huge windows let in a lot of light and give you great views over the city too. For even better views, there’s a rooftop pool and lounge area to hang out at. I like that it’s right next to many of the city’s main attractions (like the Johnny Cash Museum and the Ryman Auditorium) too. All units have a dedicated workspace (perfect if you need to do work on the road), a washer/dryer, a 55” Apple TV with streaming, and a fully equipped kitchen with a dishwasher, stove, sink, microwave, full size fridge, coffee maker, and stovetop kettle. Some units even have a private balcony. While there’s no breakfast on-site, you’re just a couple of blocks away from the 24/7 Sun Diner. It’s retro, kitschy, and fun, paying homage to the legendary artists (like Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash) of Sun Records while serving up Southern favorites. I always eat here when I visit. Book here!   3. 1 Hotel Nashville When I want to splash out on a luxury stay, this is the hotel I choose. A five-star property, it has over 56,000 plants coating the façade, and I love all their attention to sustainability throughout. The hotel restaurant serves sustainably sourced farm-to-table cuisine from breakfast through dinner, and there are even electric Audi hotel cars that you can reserve if you’re heading out on a day trip. As an avid gym-goer, I also really appreciate the 24/7 fitness center (they offer complimentary group fitness classes for hotel guests too). There’s also a full-service wellness spa if you want something more relaxing. The spacious rooms are bedecked with wood-paneled walls and have tons of light thanks to the floor-to-ceiling windows. The pillow top beds with sustainably sourced bedding are super comfortable, and in-room amenities include 55” flatscreen TVs, minibars, safes, Nespresso machines, and even yoga mats. I really like that every faucet has a filter, so you can avoid single use plastic bottles by either filling up your own bottle or using the provided upcycled wine-to-water bottles. While the bathrooms are a bit on the smaller side, I love the rainfall showers and the comfy bathrobes and slippers. There are complimentary eco-friendly toiletries too. It’s a really relaxing place to stay if you’ve got a bigger budget. Book here!   4. Bode This apartment hotel offers comfortable suites and apartments just a couple of blocks from Honky Tonk Highway and all the city’s museums. I think it’s the best value in the area. While it’s a modern hotel with no staff on-site (you check in online and get a keycode), I like that it has a cocktail bar and retro café (that serves breakfast sandwiches and smoothies), so there’s still a buzz about. There’s also a huge outdoor area with loungers, fire pits, and corn hole. As a solo traveler, I always appreciate it when hotels create these kinds of communal spaces to allow travelers to connect. The rooms have a warm and contemporary style, as well as really comfy beds. All rooms come with basic amenities like a flatscreen TV and tea/coffee maker, while the apartments have a kitchenette that features a dishwasher, fridge, and a microwave. Some of the larger apartments even have fun features like foosball tables. It’s perfect for travelers with a modest budget who want a central location. Book here!   5. The Graduate If you love Dolly Parton, you’ve got to stay here. This four-star boutique hotel is entirely Dolly-themed, with lots of bright colors, a retro theme, and vibrant, Dolly-inspired art and memorabilia throughout the property. I love how kitschy it all is. There are three restaurants on site: a lobby café that serves grab-and-go breakfast fare, an extremely Instagrammable rooftop cocktail bar offering panoramic views over the city, and on the weekends, there’s even a karaoke bar with an animatronic backup band. There’s a rooftop pool too, though it’s an additional cost (plus it’s tiny and requires a reservation, so I’d skip it). The rooms are spacious and have a country glam design, with striped walls, brightly patterned carpets, and portraits of country music stars over the headboards. All rooms have a velvet lounge chair, a large writing desk, an electric kettle with tea/coffee, and a flatscreen TV. The black-and-white tiled bathrooms are a dark and moody contrast, with pedestal sinks and complimentary toiletries. While the carnival-like atmosphere might not be for everyone (there are a lot of bachelorette parties and influencers taking photos, especially on weekends), if you want something super unique, this is the place! Book here!   6. Waymore’s Guest House \u0026 Casual Club To contrast with the loud Dolly hotel, this hip three-star hotel is a good choice for travelers who want a quieter, affordable place to stay. I like that there’s a café in the lobby that serves food all day: diner-inspired breakfasts in the morning and drinks and bar bites in the evening. It’s nice to come back from exploring and be able to get a bite to eat. There’s a really cool cocktail bar with DJ nights on the rooftop too. They offer a huge variety of rooms, including your standard hotel rooms, rooms with bunk beds, and suites with kitchenettes if you’re traveling with a group. The rooms all have floor-to-ceiling windows, writing desks, and local artwork on the walls. I like that the mini bar is stocked with local snacks too. The tiled bathrooms are pretty spacious, with walk-in showers and high-quality bath products. It’s a good choice for travelers looking for something simple yet stylish and affordable in East Nashville. Book here!   *** From honky-tonk bars to legendary venues, Nashville hums with a contagious energy. It’s a fun, energetic city that you can easily spend a couple days exploring. And since there’s been a boom in unique hotels here in recent years, there are a lot of places to choose from. Be sure to pick one of my favorites above and get ready for an unforgettable stay in the Music City! Book Your Trip to the USA: Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Use Skyscanner to find a cheap flight. They are my favorite search engine because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned! Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the biggest inventory and best deals. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are: Safety Wing (best for everyone) InsureMyTrip (for those over 70) Medjet (for additional evacuation coverage) Looking for the Best Companies to Save Money With?

The tiled bathrooms are pretty spacious, with walk-in showers and high-quality bath products. It’s a good choice for travelers looking for something simple yet stylish and affordable in East Nashville.\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003ccenter\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/waymore-39-s-guest-house-and-casual-club.en.html?aid=1383362\u0026amp;no_rooms=1\u0026amp;group_adults=2\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBook here!\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n \n\u003ccenter\u003e***\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom honky-tonk bars to legendary venues, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/where-to-stay-nashville/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eNashville\u003c/a\u003e hums with a contagious energy.
