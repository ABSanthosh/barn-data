  "description": "This group of sculptures, collectively known as \"Dr Salter's Daydream,\" depict Dr. Alfred Salter, his wife Ada, their daughter Joyce, and their cat. Created by Diane Gorvin, the sculptures were originally unveiled in 1991 but have since moved to their current location. Dr. Alfred Salter arrived in Bermondsey in 1898, a newly qualified doctor shocked by the poverty and misfortune he encountered. Bermondsey wasn't just where Dr. Salter practiced medicine; it became his home. He and Ada, who he met through the Bermondsey Settlement, an organization offering education and social opportunities to the disadvantaged, chose to live amongst those they served. Alfred offered free medical care, a radical act at the time that drew criticism from his peers. Ada was a force in local politics, a suffragist and later Mayor of Bermondsey. As the first female mayor of a London borough, she advocated tirelessly for improved housing and green spaces. The original sculpture captured Dr. Salter in his later years, daydreaming of happier times with his young daughter Joyce. Tragically, Joyce died of scarlet fever in 1910, a victim of the very conditions her parents fought so hard to improve. This personal tragedy fueled their commitment to social reform. In 2011 the statue of Dr. Salter was stolen, and when recast, the reinstallation provided an opportunity to right a historical oversight. When the statue of Ada was added, it became the first public sculpture of a female politician in London.",
