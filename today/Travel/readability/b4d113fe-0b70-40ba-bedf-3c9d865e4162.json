What Will It Mean for Travelers?Some flights near Washington will be suspended on June 14 to accommodate military flyovers and fireworks displays. Here’s how it might affect travelers.American Airlines has a hub at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, where airline operations will be halted on June 14.Credit...STEFANI REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty ImagesJune 6, 2025Updated 3:31 p.m. ETRonald Reagan National Airport will suspend airline operations on June 14 to accommodate flyovers and fireworks displays for a military parade held in honor of the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary, a date that coincides with President Trump’s 79th birthday.Aviation experts say the flight interruptions are unusually disruptive and far more significant than those caused by other major events like presidential inaugurations.The airport, also known as DCA and one of three in the Washington area, said in a statement that the parade, which the Army estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million, may impact scheduled flights and that travelers should “check the status of their flights directly with their airline.”Here’s what you need to know.Will the airport be closed?A spokesperson for DCA said in an email that the airport would “remain open” but that flights were expected to be halted during the fireworks and parade flyover. The parade is scheduled between 6:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. and will be followed by a fireworks display at 9:45 p.m.The F.A.A. said it intends to stop all arrivals and departures during the “peak of the celebration.” An agency spokesman did not provide further detail about how long air traffic operations would be paused.How often is DCA closed for big events?Michael McCormick, a professor of air traffic management at Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical University, said that while it wasn’t unusual for the F.A.A. to pause traffic for a major air event close to an airport, the impact of the military parade would exceed other notable federal events.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
