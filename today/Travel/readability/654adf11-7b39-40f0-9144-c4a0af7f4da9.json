  "text": "Remember Couchsurfing? It was a website that allowed you to stay with locals (for free) and always had a plethora of events and meetups you could attend no matter where you were in the world. It was one of the best ways to meet locals and travelers on the road. It was one of my favorite sites. Pretty much everyone on the team here used it a lot over the years. My Director of Content, for example, was not only an avid traveler who went on multiple multi-day trips with strangers thanks to Couchsurfing, but he was also a host, and he was even featured in a calendar they made one year! I used it to stay in places like Copenhagen, London, Oxford, Munich, Broome, Paris, Osaka, Athens, and so forth and so forth. I mean, I loved it. I met people in cities like Lyon just to hang out, did meet-ups in NYC, Hong Kong, Bangkok, and so many other places. But ever since the site started charging around 2013, and then instituted a paywall during the pandemic, fewer and fewer people have used it. These days, it’s a shell of its former self. While researching the latest edition of my book on budget travel (coming out in March 2025!), I rejoined Couchsurfing to see how active it was, and even in the largest metropolitan centers, there were barely a few dozen active profiles within the previous month. For example, London showed 229,457 total hosts but only 896 active hosts in the last six months — and only 496 active within the last month. That’s a big, big difference! It’s a real shame as Couchsurfing really changed the way people traveled. It was as ubiquitous as Lonely Planet! So, with Couchsurfing (and similar websites) pretty dead, where does one go to meet people now? Answer: Facebook — which is honestly the last place I would have thought, because, well, it’s Facebook, and most younger travelers don’t use it as much as TikTok or Instagram. After all, Facebook also has a well-deserved reputation as the place your aunt posts memes or your crazy cousin rants about racist stuff. But, whenever I sign into Facebook, I keep seeing posts from all sorts of groups in my feed, with people looking for travel buddies: backpacking Europe, backpacking Australia, digital nomads in (insert destination), find a travel buddy…the list of groups goes on and on. I was skeptical of them at first, because when I took a deeper look at the posts, it always felt like they were just sleazy guys hitting on young girls and AI-generated girl accounts designed trap someone. “Hi I’m Anna from US looking to travel dm me” doesn’t strike me as something an actual person would say. While female-only groups have been a legitimate way to meet people for a long time (Girls Love Travel being one of the most famous), the mixed-gender ones always felt a little sketchy. But they kept popping up in my feed. So I looked into them more carefully to see if they really were spammy. While there were many fake profiles and creepy dudes (sorry, guys, but it’s the internet, and there are tons of those), sometimes I did come across real people who seemed generally interested in meeting others, however few and far between they were. Are these groups really a good way to meet people? There was only one way to find out. I used the group Find a Travel Buddy while in Europe and posted some of my tentative plans. I got hundreds of responses and direct messages, which was pretty overwhelming. A lot of it was spam: people telling me to come visit them in India (I’m posting about Europe), people sending me hellos, a few marriage proposals, and some really inappropriate comments. (Side note: if I get those kinds of responses, I can only imagine what it’s like for women, who I often see edit their posts to ask people to stop coming on to them. Quite sad.) But I waded through all the junk and eventually found real people to meet up with. In the end, I only met a few of them, as either my plans shifted or theirs did. But the interactions I had were really great. I had an awesome night out in Freiburg, Germany, with a group of folks, and another with an Italian girl and her friends in Amsterdam. Each time, they took me around to places I wouldn’t have seen otherwise, and I got to meet locals. It was a good way to make new friends and find people to talk to. Even though you have to wade through a lot of garbage, I think these groups are great, especially if you are traveling alone. While I don’t have the personality to go on a multi-day trip with a stranger, I did love the ability to meet people as I traveled. If you’re looking to use them, here are some suggestions to minimize (but not eliminate) the garbage replies: Be specific about where you are going and when (otherwise, people will spam ya with “come visit X!”). Ask people who respond to be specific about themselves. Be clear about what you are looking for (age, kind of travel partner, gender, etc.) My current favorite groups are: Find A Travel Buddy Girls LOVE Travel Backpacking South America Digital Nomads Solo Trips \u0026 Travelers From there, for safety, I would highly recommend looking at the profiles of respondents to make sure they are real and only meet in public places. Beyond that, have fun! These groups might not be as easy to use as Couchsurfing was, but at least there is something these days to help you meet locals and other travelers. I’m now a believer in and fan of these groups and will definitely be using them more on future trips. Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner. It’s my favorite search engine because it searches websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is being left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as it consistently returns the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are: SafetyWing (best for everyone) InsureMyTrip (for those 70 and over) Medjet (for additional evacuation coverage) Want to Travel for Free? Travel credit cards allow you to earn points that can be redeemed for free flights and accommodation — all without any extra spending. Check out my guide to picking the right card and my current favorites to get started and see the latest best deals. Need Help Finding Activities for Your Trip? Get Your Guide is a huge online marketplace where you can find cool walking tours, fun excursions, skip-the-line tickets, private guides, and more. Ready to Book Your Trip?
