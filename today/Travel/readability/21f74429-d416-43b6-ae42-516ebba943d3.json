She didn’t bother asking what we wanted for breakfast; the answer was obvious. Here, a good day always begins with waffles and coffee.Nyvagar, a classic red-fronted lodge, serves as a restaurant, hotel and — in winter — a dreamy base for guided backcountry skiing, complete with saunas, northern lights and hearty meals. Though we’d only stopped in for breakfast, we might have entered the backdrop of a contemporary Norwegian fairy tale with Ullr, the Norse god of snow and skiing, at its center.Dangling at the western edge of the European mainland and well above the Arctic Circle, Lofoten, which looks like a peninsula on the map, is actually a group of about 80 islands, with five of these hosting most of its 25,000 residents. It isn’t on the way to anything, except a high-latitude version of paradise. (The area was one of the 52 Places to Go in 2025.)For centuries, Vikings navigated these waters by sail and oar; today, ferries and charter boats offer comfortable, scenic access to the islands. Complementing Lofoten’s two small airports — in Svolvaer and Leknes — the local ferry system provides a variety of travel options, including inter-island express boats and for scenic multi-day trips the Hurtigruten cruise line.ImageThe uninhabited island of Lille Molla is one of about 80 in the Lofoten peninsula, with five of them home to most of the area’s 25,000 residents.Credit...Patrick FarrellThank you for your patience while we verify access.
