  "description": "In 1978, Jose ‘Pitok’ Blanco, a renowned Angono born muralist, and his six children held an art exhibit at the National Museum of the Philippines in Manila. Two years later, the family opened the Blanco Family Museum. Eventually, their seventh child became an artist, and Pitok’s wife, Loreto ‘Loring,’ belatedly picked up her brush and joined the family. The museum showcases the evolution of the Blanco family as artists, and displays all their work, as well as various awards the family received from both local and international bodies.  Pitok taught his children the basics early on but allowed them to develop their own styles. According to one of the sons, the family maintained daily scheduled painting sessions, helping hone their skills. The prolific family embarked on painting excursions around the world, resulting in diverse and interesting paintings, which is apparent when you compare of each of their works when visiting the museum. Pitok’s masterpiece, the ‘Angono Fisherman’s Festival,’ is a large-scale canvas depicting the faces of over a hundred townsfolk. It garnered admiration for its impressive breadth and details, as Pitok spent years visiting his neighbors’ homes to sketch their faces. Pitok and his family all appear within this scene.",
