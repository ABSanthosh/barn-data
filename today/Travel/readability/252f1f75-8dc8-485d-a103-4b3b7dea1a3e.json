But, once I stopped trying to fit Los Angeles into the typical tourist mold and gave the city a chance, I really began to appreciate LA’s unique charm and laid-back lifestyle. That’s when I truly fell in love with the city, and I suspect you will too. It’s a city built for residents, not tourists. But, if you (like me) are a visitor, you’ll still need a great place to stay. Your choice of hotel can make or break a trip. Since the city is so spread out, where you stay will have a big impact on what you see and how much time you spend in traffic. I’ve stayed in a lot of hotels in Los Angeles over the years. To help you have an unforgettable time in the City of Angels, here’s a list of my favorite hotels in LA: 1. The Kinney The Kinney Hotel is a vibrant three-star boutique hotel in Venice Beach. I think it really captures the essence of the city’s laid-back, artistic spirit. I love the hotel’s fun and youthful character, with its colorful decor, quirky art installations, and retro-inspired furnishings. There are a lot of amenities here too, including a heated outdoor pool, a stylish lounge area with fire pits, bike rentals, and a fitness center. The hotel’s central courtyard is a social hub (which they call The Quad) and features ping pong tables and a cozy lounge space, perfect for relaxing or mingling with fellow travelers. The stylish rooms have a quirky vibe too, with wooden furniture and colorful artwork on the walls. The bathrooms, while a bit dated, are decently sized and covered in colorful tiles and artwork. They also feature complimentary toiletries and fluffy bathrobes. There’s underground parking on-site (rare for LA), which is perfect if you’re on a SoCal road trip. Book here!   2. Sixty Beverly Hills This contemporary four-star hotel is in the heart of iconic Beverly Hills. Sixty features sleek, modern interiors with mid-century design elements (like geometric shapes, minimalist wooden furniture, and wide open spaces). I especially love the rooftop pool and lounge with its panoramic city views. There’s also a trendy on-site restaurant and bar that serves inventive cuisine and craft cocktails. It’s pretty pricey, but that’s just LA. The rooms and suites are huge and boast sleek hardwood floors, custom furnishings, luxurious bedding, and floor-to-ceiling windows that offer stunning views of Beverly Hills or the LA skyline. Some rooms have balconies too. Amenities include a writing desk, plush bedding, a flatscreen TV, Nespresso machine, and a well-stocked minibar. The spacious bathrooms have marble countertops, rainfall showers, and luxury bath products. It’s the ideal choice for travelers seeking a stylish stay in one of LA’s most prestigious neighborhoods. Book here!   3. Venice V Hotel This historic 1915 building was once home to Charlie Chaplin. It’s since been renovated into a chic three-star hotel that perfectly embodies the eclectic and bohemian vibe of Venice Beach. It’s just steps away from the iconic Muscle Beach, and I really like that they provide helpful beach amenities, like beach cruisers as well as umbrellas and chairs to use. Each room is uniquely designed in one of three themes: Boho, Artist, or Dogtown. I love that all rooms have stunning ocean views, so you can wake up and gaze at the wide-open expanse. The beds are really comfy and have fluffy down pillows too. The spacious bathrooms have beautifully tiled walk-in showers, Aesop bath amenities, and soft bathrobes. This is the best place to stay if you want to splash out on a stay in one of LA’s most famous neighborhoods. Book here!   4. Shutters on the Beach Shutters on the Beach is a luxurious five-star hotel that exudes a classic, coastal charm reminiscent of a grand beach house. Located directly on the sands of Santa Monica, this seaside hotel has an inviting yet elegant atmosphere, with curated art pieces adorning the walls. I like the fact that they have a range of top-notch amenities, including a full-service spa, an oceanfront pool and hot tub, and multiple dining options (one of which provides breakfast) serving fresh, locally sourced cuisine. The hotel has a beachy design with airy, sunlit rooms. It also boasts hardwood floors, refined Tibetan rugs, artwork by local artists, and little in-room libraries. The rooms have all the amenities you’d expect from a hotel of this caliber. The plush bathrobes, slippers, and premium bath products are really lovely too. Most rooms even offer private balconies with stunning ocean views. It’s the perfect retreat for those who want laid-back luxury. Book here!   5. CitizenM Los Angeles This four star-hotel is the perfect spot for the modern traveler looking for comfort, style, and convenience without breaking the bank. I’m a big fan of this brand (they’re huge in Europe), with its minimalist design and vibrant, art-filled interiors. I also love all the communal spaces where you can work or unwind, from the cozy living room-style lobby to the rooftop bar with panoramic views of the city. The breakfast buffet is really expansive too with pastries, healthy choices, and hot dishes like scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausages. Part of citizenM’s concept is to offer one room type that’s compact yet thoughtfully designed to optimize the space. All rooms have fridges, comfy king-sized beds, fluffy pillows, blackout blinds, and soundproofing so you can get a good sleep. The bathrooms are compact yet well-designed too, with rain showers and citizenM’s signature toiletries with a choice of “AM” or “PM” scents. I love that the rooms have wall-to-wall windows that let in plenty of LA sunshine too. It’s a trendy hotel that’s both inviting and functional, perfect for travelers who want to stay in DTLA (downtown LA) near all the art museums. Don’t miss The Last Bookstore just down the street! It’s my favorite bookstore in the city and a must for fellow book lovers. Book here!   6. Andaz West Hollywood This five-star hotel by Hyatt is the place to be if you want modern luxury right on the iconic Sunset Strip. (It was actually the first hotel on the strip!) I love this brand a lot and this location has a lot of open and airy spaces featuring local artists. The rooftop pool is the highlight of the hotel though. Make sure to come up here to relax on the loungers or take some epic panoramic photos. Another nice touch is the complimentary wine between 4pm and 5pm every evening. The rooms are spacious and stylish, offering floor-to-ceiling windows with sweeping views of either the Hollywood Hills or Los Angeles skyline. Each room has a minimalist style and amenities like flatscreen TVs, Bluetooth speakers, and a complimentary minibar with snacks and non-alcoholic drinks. The beds are comfy, and I appreciate the spacious work desks too. The stylish bathrooms feature spacious walk-in rain showers, plush robes, and complimentary designer toiletries. Andaz is right in West Hollywood, the best choice for first-time visitors to the city. (It’s central to most things you’ll want to visit.) And, since it’s a Hyatt property, you can book rooms and suites on points (if you want to learn more about the world of points and miles, this post can help you get started). Book here! *** Los Angeles is a sprawling city where glitz and grit blend together, offering a unique mix of sun-soaked beaches, eclectic neighborhoods, and a diverse food scene that’s hard to beat. From the iconic Hollywood Hills to the artistic streets of Venice Beach, there’s always something new and exciting to explore. Just pick from one of the hotels above and you’re sure to have a great stay in the City of Angels! Book Your Trip to Los Angeles: Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Use Skyscanner. It’s my favorite search engine because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the biggest inventory and best deals. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels. For hostel suggestions, check out my list of the best hostels in Los Angeles! Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are: Safety Wing (for everyone below 70) Insure My Trip (for those over 70) Medjet (for additional repatriation coverage) Looking for the Best Companies to Save Money With?
