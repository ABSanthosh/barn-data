  "description": "Where rusted bolts and tattered fabric, three coach cars, a swayback flat car, and a coal car are found, visitors can almost hear echoes of the past as the breeze blows through the shattered windows of abandoned train cars. It's easy to imagine the 19th and early 20th-century passengers taking in the beauty of the lush forest preceding the major pass of Crawford Notch. Many such passengers would have boarded the Maine Central Railroad’s Mountain Division Line en route to one of the opulent resorts that dotted the tracks. Tourists who wish to take a similar journey may want to check out the Conway Scenic Railroad, which still offers rides through the notch.",
