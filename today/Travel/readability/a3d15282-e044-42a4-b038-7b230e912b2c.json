One of the things that keeps a lot of people from achieving that dream is money. Saving money to travel can be an uphill battle but travel is not as expensive as you think. There are plenty of ways to save money on the road and lower your costs. And you don’t have to be a backpacker to travel cheap. There are tons of ways to travel on a budget without sacrificing comfort. One of the easiest ways to travel on a budget is to just go somewhere inexpensive. There are plenty of amazing places to visit that are still quite affordable. In fact, many of them are actually cheaper than day-to-day life back home! And, while there are dozens upon dozens of inexpensive countries you can visit, in this post, I am going to share my favorite that I think are the best! 1. Thailand Despite being a hugely popular tourist destination, Thailand has remained relatively cheap. Outside of the popular island destinations, it’s easy to visit the country for around $50 USD per day if you’re backpacking. Hostel dorms cost $10 USD per night, you can eat on less than $10 USD per day if you stick to delicious street food markets, drinks are just a couple bucks each, and tours and activities don’t cost much more than $20-30 USD. If you’re not looking to backpack around Thailand, you can still visit the country on a budget if you use points for hotels, stick to budget accommodation, continue to stick to street food vendors and public transportation. If you do that, you’d spend around $100 USD per day. For more information, check out my guide to visiting Thailand. 2. Mexico I’ll be honest: I was late to the game on Mexico. It wasn’t until a few years ago that I finally took the time out to explore the country. The country is just incredible. Mayan ruins, stunning beaches, lush jungles, world-class food, picturesque cenotes, mezcal….I love the country. The trick to having an affordable trip to Mexico is to get out of the tourist regions. Leave Tulum (it’s the worst place in the world anyway), Playa del Carmen, Cabo San Lucas, Cancun, and all the other resort towns filled with American hotel brands and tourists. Hostels cost between $10-15 USD per night, street tacos are $1 USD or less, other meals will set you back $5-10 USD, beer is around $1-2 USD, and even big-ticket sites like Chichen Itza are just $5-15 USD. If you aren’t looking to backpack, you can still visit affordably. On a midrange budget of about $80, you can stay in a private hostel room or cheap hotel, eat out at restaurants serving cheap traditional cuisine, visit more attractions, enjoy a few drinks, and take the occasional taxi to get around. For more information on how to plan a trip there, check out my guide to visiting Mexico. 3. Portugal Portugal is not only one of my favorite countries in Europe but it’s one of the cheapest eurozone countries as well. Offering charming cities, stunning coastlines, and beautiful weather, this country has become much more popular in recent years. There’s a growing expat scene as well as a lively digital nomad community. You can get by here for around $50 USD per day without missing out on the amazing food, fun activities, and delicious wine. On this budget, you’ll be staying in a hostel dorm room, cooking all of your meals, limiting your drinking, using public transportation to get around, and sticking to free activities like free walking tours and enjoying the beaches. While prices are a bit higher in popular Lisbon, you can easily offset that by visiting in the shoulder season or in the winter. For more information, check out my guide to visiting Portugal. 4. Central America Central America is one of the cheapest regions of the world, with pretty much every country here an affordable place to visit. Because of that, I’m including the whole region! In countries like El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala you’ll find the best deals, with budget hotels costing around $15 USD, meals for $3-4 USD, bus journeys for the same price, and beer for less than a dollar. In the “expensive” countries in the region (Belize, Panama, Costa Rica), you’ll be spending closer to $50 USD per day, though you won’t be wanting for anything as street food costs under $5 USD and hostel dorms are $8-12 USD. For more information on the region, check out my guide to visiting Central America. 5. Hungary Hungary is an amazing, affordable country, the highlight of which is Budapest. I love Budapest. It’s a beautiful, historic city. Hostels in Budapest start at $10 USD per night. Meals at the markets or at the plethora of kebab and sandwich shops are around $5-10 USD. Trains and buses were just a few dollars while a beer is less than $2 USD. Unless you are going out for a big night of drinking or paying for lots of attractions and activities, $50 USD will give you plenty of room to enjoy the sites and sounds of the country. And the Budapest is a great alternative to more popular destinations like Prague or Vienna, offering just as much fun for a fraction of the cost. For more information, check out our guide to visiting Hungary. 6. Peru Home to the epic Wonder of the World, Machu Picchu, Peru is one of the most popular countries in South America. I absolutely loved my trip there. It’s a country I would go back to over and over again. While hiking the Inca Trail will definitely burst your budget, everyday life in Peru is quite affordable. If you want to backpack Peru, I’d plan for $50–80 USD per day. On this budget, you’d be staying in hostel dorms, eating at typical hole-in-the-wall restaurants and cafés, limiting your drinking, taking public transportation and overnight buses, and doing a few paid activities and tours. If you’re going to party a lot, you’ll be on the higher end of this range. And, if you do want to do some guided hikes but don’t have the money, try to book last minute. You can usually find amazing deals — including deals for hikes like the Inca Trail. While you might end up spending more than $50 USD per day, those once-in-a-lifetime experiences are worth it. For more information, check out my guide to visiting Peru.   7. Vietnam Vietnam is one of the cheapest countries in Southeast Asia. From the stunning views of Sam Mountain and Ha Long Bay to the man-made artistry of the sacred temples and pagodas to the rice terraces and beaches, Vietnam is stunning. Hostels can be found for as little as $4-5 USD, with many including free breakfast and free beer (during limited hours). Food from street vendors can be found for under $1-2 USD, and buses around the country are incredibly cheap. Even activities here are cheap. The Cu Chi Tunnels (tunnels used by the Viet Cong during the Vietnam war) are just $5 USD to visit while a full day of canyoning is just $20 USD. For more information, check out my guide to visiting Vietnam! 8. India No budget travel list would be complete without India. India has always been an inexpensive place to visit, but the steep decline in the Indian rupee in recent years has made the country an even bigger bargain. You can travel well here for very little money, and increasing your budget by just a few dollars can often lead to substantial increases in luxury. For example, on a budget of $30-45 per day, you can do the typical backpacker thing: guesthouses, cheap food, sleeper trains, and overland buses. In the larger cities of Mumbai, New Delhi, and Bangalore as well as beach destinations like Goa, you can expect to spend around $45-55 per day. But, if you doubled that, there’s virtually nothing you couldn’t do from private tour guides to three- or four-star hotels to opulent meals to internal flights. The country is generally just really, really cheap. 9. Taiwan Taiwan is one of the most underrated countries in Asia. It’s super affordable, safe, clean, and has plenty of things to see and do. You can easily visit Taiwan for $40-50 USD per day as food and accommodation are both super affordable. Hostels start around $10 USD while street food costs just a couple dollars (and is super tasty). There are plenty of markets, lots of hiking, convenient public transportation, and a fun nightlife. No matter what you are interested in, you can find it in Taiwan. You’ll get a lot of value here. For more information, check out my guide to visiting Taiwan. ***There are many great destinations in the world that don’t have to cost a fortune. And, if you use points to fly there, you can save even more money. And, even if you aren’t an uber budget traveler and want some more luxury, all the destinations listed here can still provide a lot of luxury on a bargain. By visiting some of these budget destinations, you’ll be able to stretch your budget and make your trip financially attainable.

If you’re going to party a lot, you’ll be on the higher end of this range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, if you do want to do some guided hikes but don’t have the money, try to book last minute. You can usually find amazing deals — including deals for hikes like the Inca Trail. While you might end up spending more than $50 USD per day, those once-in-a-lifetime experiences are worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information, check out my guide to \u003ca href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/peru-travel-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003evisiting Peru\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr/\u003e\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"Vietnam\"\u003e7.
