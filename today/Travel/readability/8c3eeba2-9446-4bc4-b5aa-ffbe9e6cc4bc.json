  "description": "Once off-limits to the public, this desert facility near Marana, Arizona now offers guided tours arranged through the airport. It used to be marked by a guardhouse with a ”Use of Deadly Force Authorized” sign; today, visitors can drive right up to the fence, and with a little planning, they can even explore the airpark’s contents up close. The site stores commercial aircraft for airlines and clients around the world, with an incredible range that is always changing. Additionally, several companies on the property paint, repair, and salvage aircraft. One section of the airpark holds very old aircraft, including a few 747s from airlines like TWA and, until recently, Pan Am. For those who schedule a tour, the experience can include a look inside a small building with photographs and memorabilia, as well as a drive around the facility with exceptional commentary.",
