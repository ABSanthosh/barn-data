It also announced a $2.5 billion share repurchase program and plans for operational changes, including speeding up how long it takes to get planes back in the air after they have landed and finding other ways to reduce costs.Southwest shares were closed more than 5 percent higher on Thursday after rising more than 10 percent in early trading after the announcement.Bob Jordan, Southwest’s chief executive, presented the initiative during a meeting with investors and analysts on Thursday morning, calling it “the most transformational plan” in the airline’s history.“We’ve laid out a plan that is built on the values and the principles that generated years of financial success and shareholder returns that garnered admiration, loyalty and love,” he said.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
