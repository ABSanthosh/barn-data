Having recently lost my grandparents, I can tell you that I have never been more grateful for all the time that we spent together -and how much we loved traveling with them every summer. It is the time you spend together, and the memories you make, that makes life worth living.Multi-generational travel has become very popular and with good reason. As families live further apart and lives are crazier than ever, it is important to carve out that time to have shared experiences, nurture family relationships and create those memories that will last a lifetime.Naturally this type of travel does not come without challenges. I recently spoke with two local women who have traveled as a Multi-Gen family and here are their stories:In April, Jeanne Sciocchetti, her husband and their daughter took Jeanne’s parents away to celebrate their 50th Anniversary. Here is what Jeanne has to say about Multi-Gen travel:“For more than ten years I had the idea I wanted to send my parents back to Bermuda, where they had honeymooned in 1969, for their 50th Anniversary. When it came time to plan, we decided to tag along with them for this trip down memory lane.Having three generations of our family together to share this experience made it so special. All of us being there with them and listening to all of their stories was magical, and it also gave my 7-year old daughter a chance to feel like she was part of their love story. Even though we all spend a lot of time together, this is not something that could have happened at home. The memories we made on this trip will last more than a lifetime – they’ll last for three lifetimes!”You can read the full story about their trip to Bermuda (from the Grandparents’ perspective) here in the Fall/Winter 2019 issue of Saratoga Bride.We also had the opportunity to speak with Kelly Wyland, who explains that doing two big trips in one year is not the norm for her family, but when you have opportunities like this, you have to go for it. Kelly and her family traveled to Ireland as an extension of a work trip and to France as a school trip with her daughter.Anne: What were some of the highlights of multi-gen travel for you?Kelly: While in Ireland, we had the opportunity to experience part of our family’s history going back many generations. In Paris, it was all about sharing experiences and making new memories.A: Any challenges?K: It was difficult at times for the grandparents to keep up with the younger ones when navigating busy streets and some older hotels did not have elevators.A: What are your suggestions for others planning a multi-gen trip?K:  Be willing to compromise. Be aware of mobility issues and stamina, and plan accordingly. You don’t have to do everything together, but plan to meet up for lunch or dinner and share your experiences. Take tons of photos and don’t be afraid to ask strangers to take your picture so you can all be in it (and then offer to reciprocate!).A: Who did this trip affect the most?K: Honestly – me! I grew up with stories about my ancestors and Irish culture and have tried to teach my kids a little about that part of our family history. It was nice to have my mom to reminisce with, and my kids to learn with. We all have roots there and it was an unforgettable experience to step foot into the same country my ancestors left so many years ago. It’s something all of us will remember for the rest of our lives.Don’t wait to plan your Multi-Gen trip – life is too short.For more information on Multi-Gen contact: Anne Gordon Live Life Travel, an independent affiliate of Travel Experts Member of Virtuoso, Virtuoso Family, Culinary, Wellness Virtuoso Saveur Advisory Board.LiveLifeTravel.world | 518-966-2663",
