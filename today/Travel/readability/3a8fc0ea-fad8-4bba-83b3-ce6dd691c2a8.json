Once the rhinos have acclimated to their new surroundings, visitors can go to the sanctuary to see them.Credit...Scott WenhamJan. 31, 2025Daybreak filtered through spindly stands of Terminalia trees, and the windshield glowed. It was September in northwest Zimbabwe, and the morning carried the lingering chill of an African winter. I rode at the head of a convoy that had been rumbling through the night. Campfires flickered eerily from the forest, where truckers ferrying copper out of Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo had stopped to rest.A towering man with slate-colored eyes yawned at the wheel. Mark Butcher, a Zimbabwean in his 60s, had led the convoy for more than 14 hours from the grassy Lowveld of southeast Zimbabwe toward the fringes of Hwange National Park in the northwest.Hwange is a wildlife lover’s dream, and Mr. Butcher — who was once a ranger there, and now manages Imvelo, a small safari company that helps villages near the park benefit from tourism and conservation — knows it well. Leopards, lions, Cape buffalo and more than 50,000 elephants are among the animals that roam the 5,660-square-mile expanse. But there is one animal among the Big Five that has long been absent: the rhinoceros.Mr. Butcher was in the process of changing that.Tucked in the middle of the convoy was a six-wheel-drive truck carrying two wild, drugged white rhinoceroses that had been donated from a private reserve 280 miles south of Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital. There, a philanthropic American hedge fund manager has spent more than 25 years creating one of the world’s most successful rhino repopulation programs, expanding the herd to several hundred from a few dozen.ImageThe truck carrying the two rhinos was accompanied by ecologists, veterinarians and others who had traveled overnight from a private reserve in southeast Zimbabwe where a philanthropic American hedge fund manager has created one of the world’s most successful rhino repopulation programs.Credit...James WardFor decades, only a few of these extraordinary mammals could be found in the country at all. By 2002, Africa’s rhinos had been poached to the brink of extinction for their horns and the myth that they hold curative powers.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
