  "description": "The Campus Theatre is an operational single-screen Art Deco theater located in the Lewisburg, Pennsylvania Historic District. It shows a mix of new wide releases, arthouse films, and classics, with selections rotating nearly every day. Opened in January 1941, the theater was built by the Stiefel brothers—Russian emigrees who operated a number of theaters across the region—and based on designs by architect David Supowitz. It was owned by the Stiefel family until 2001 when a film professor at nearby Bucknell University purchased it and converted it into a nonprofit. The nonprofit partnered with Bucknell to purchase the building in 2006 and renovate it in keeping with its original Art Deco design. The reonvation project, which also included upgrades to the auditorium’s projection and sound systems, was completed in 2011. In a nod to a bygone era, the volunteer-run theater offers affordable tickets and concessions. It also has regular BYOB showings where patrons over 21 can bring their own beer or wine.",
