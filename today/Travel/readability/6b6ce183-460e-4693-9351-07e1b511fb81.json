NormanThe reporters interviewed over 50 people who bought memberships. Rukmini Callimachi attended a three-hour sales pitch at a Hyatt-run resort in Cancún, Mexico.Published Oct. 31, 2024Updated Nov. 2, 2024Shortly after Hope and William Gagnon arrived in Cancún, Mexico, from Detroit, the couple were approached by a salesperson from a vacation club. About 21 hours later, they had agreed to pay $27,000 to join the club — a significant commitment for Ms. Gagnon, a customer feedback specialist, and Mr. Gagnon, a hospital courier.They had bought what they believed the Unlimited Vacation Club was selling: free or deeply discounted weeklong stays at luxury resorts with opulent suites, pristine beaches, swim-up bars and private concierges.But the Gagnons learned after they signed the contract that the club had numerous restrictions. The unavailability of many resorts, hidden fees and a requirement to pay extra for upgrades that would give them access to the swankiest rooms made it nearly impossible to book the kind of vacation that had impressed them during a pitch meeting. “I was like, my God, we got had,” Ms. Gagnon said.Vacation clubs are the latest twist on timeshares — an industry often criticized, and even mocked, for using aggressive sales tactics to persuade people to buy a share of a vacation property, giving them the right to use it for a certain number of days a year. In a vacation club, there is no actual real estate ownership. Instead, people make a down payment to join, followed by monthly payments, to get discounted rates at a portfolio of resorts.ImageHope and William Gagnon imagined that their $27,000 membership would allow them to travel the world.Credit...Brittany Greeson for The New York TimesThank you for your patience while we verify access.
