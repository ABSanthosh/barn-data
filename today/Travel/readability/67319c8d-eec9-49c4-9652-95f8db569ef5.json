Even after multiple visits, I never get tired of wandering the country’s historic temples, feasting on its incredible sushi, and soaking up the breakneck pace of life in Tokyo. After over half a dozen visits, I’ve learned through trial and error how to best explore the country. English isn’t widely spoken, and once you get out of the big cities, it’s even less common. That means things like online maps and translation apps are vital for every traveler. To ensure you stay connected during your trip, you’re going to want to buy an eSIM. It’s the best way to ensure you have mobile data as you explore the country. But which eSIM is the best for traveling Japan? In this post, I’ll breakdown why I think Jetpac is the best eSIM for Japan and why you should consider them for your next visit. What is Jetpac? Jetpac is a travel eSIM company founded in Singapore. They offer affordable mobile data coverage to over 150 destinations around the world (including Japan), but they also offer regional bundles so that you can visit more than one country with the same eSIM and still have reliable coverage. To get an eSIM, you’ll first want to browse their plans to see which duration is best for you. They have plans from 1 GB to 50 GB and 1 day to 30 days, with prices starting at just $4 USD. Their Japan eSIM prices are super competitive and affordable for even the cheapest budget traveler. Once you’ve picked your plan, you’ll be able to add the eSIM to your device. It’s super simple, but they also have free video tutorials and an FAQ on their site if you run into trouble. What I especially love is that it’s just a one-time installation. Many other eSIMs require a new installation for each new eSIM that you buy. That’s not the case with Jetpac, which makes this a great choice for travelers who want a hassle free eSIM (especially travelers who are less tech savvy). You can use a Jetpac eSIM regardless of your current data plan, however, it will only work on unlocked phones. Additionally, in Japan Jetpac has extensive 5G coverage, which means you’ll have fast and reliable mobile data everywhere you go. Jetpac doesn’t just offer eSIMs though. They actually have some pretty solid travel perks, which, in my mind, is what makes them the best eSIM for Japan. Jetpac’s Perks JetPass is the free suite of benefits that you get access to with any Jetpac purchase. This is where Jetpac really goes above and beyond, as I haven’t seen these benefits with any other eSIM provider. They offer two free perks and two paid add-ons: SmartDelay (free) With this feature, you can get free lounge access if your flight is delayed for more than an hour. All you need to do is register your flight in the Jetpac app. If your flight is delayed, you’ll get a digital LoungeKey™ voucher sent straight to your email. What I really love is that you can even register up to five traveling companions, so if you’re traveling with friends or family, you’ll all be able to get into the lounge. ExpressVPN trial (free) Cybersecurity is something that not enough travelers take seriously. I always use a VPN when I travel, and I recommend you do the same. That’s why I think it’s great that Jetpac offers a free 30-day trial of ExpressVPN, one of the best VPN services out there. (You just need to be a new user of ExpressVPN). Lounge Access (paid) If you want lounge access no matter what, you can purchase lounge passes at a discount via the Jetpac app. A lounge pass in Asia costs $30 USD, while a lounge pass in the rest of the world costs $35 USD. Considering lounges can cost $40–60 USD per person for a day pass, this is a nice way to get a discount on a pass if you don’t already have access. You can buy a single pass or buy passes in bundles of up to six passes at a time (you pay less per pass the more passes you purchase at once). Fast Track (paid) Jetpac also offers FastTrack passes in Europe and China, where you get access to lanes that let you skip the long lines of security. These passes cost $12 USD for a single pass or $62 USD for a six-pack. Pros of Jetpac Affordable prices starting at just $4 USD Lounge access for flight delays Free ExpressVPN trial Coverage for Japan \u0026 neighboring region (includes 17 countries) Data packs are valid one year from purchase Extensive 5G coverage for Japan Simple, one-time installation Cons of Jetpac Slightly more expensive than other eSIMs (but their Japan rates are competitive!) Does not offer calling and SMS messages FAQ About Jetpac eSIMs What kinds of phones are compatible with Jetpac eSIMs? As long as your phone is unlocked and eSIM compatible (pretty much all phones made after 2018 are), you’ll be able to use a Jetpac eSIM! Can you hotspot with Jetpac eSIMs? Yes, Jetpac eSIMs have hotspotting capabilities. Do I install my eSIM before or after arriving in Japan? It’s recommended to install your eSIM before arriving. Just don’t turn on roaming until you arrive so that it doesn’t activate early. Once the eSIM is activated, it’s valid for the duration that you purchased. What if I want more data or to extend my trip? You can simply buy a new pack and it will automatically connect. The great thing about Jetpac is that there is no need to ever change your eSIM. Once you have one, all you have to do is buy another pack for wherever you’re going. *** Mobile data is a must for traveling Japan. While there is plenty of free Wi-Fi around, you don’t want to have to rely on that considering how often you’ll be using your map and translate app (among many other apps no doubt). To ensure you’re always connected, get a Jetpac eSIM. They’re reliable, affordable, and have some amazing perks that can help you level yup your travels. Click here to learn more and grab your eSIM today! Book Your Trip to Japan: Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Use Skyscanner to find a cheap flight. They are my favorite search engine because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned! Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the biggest inventory and best deals. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are: Safety Wing (for everyone below 70) Insure My Trip (for those over 70) Medjet (for additional repatriation coverage) Looking for the Best Companies to Save Money With? Check out my resource page for the best companies to use when you travel. I list all the ones I use to save money when I’m on the road. They will save you money when you travel too.
