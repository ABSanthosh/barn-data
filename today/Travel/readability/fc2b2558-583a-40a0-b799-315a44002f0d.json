Some lawyers said they’re right to be worried.Some green card holders have faced greater scrutiny at U.S. ports of entry as part of the Trump administration’s restrictive immigration policy.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesMay 1, 2025, 5:01 a.m. ETThe Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration has fueled anxiety at airports, border crossings and other U.S. ports of entry, with visa holders and tourists concerned that they may be detained or deported. Even some green card holders have faced increased scrutiny.A green card, officially known as a Permanent Resident Card, is a legal authorization to live and work in the United States permanently. In the past, green card holders traveled in and out of the country with less worry than other foreign nationals, but the administration’s restrictive approach at the borders — and stronger enforcement against green card holders who have committed crimes — has changed all that.Michael Wildes, an immigration lawyer and law professor in New York, said that citizens and green card holders alike have contacted him since President Trump took office to inquire about his services if they get stopped at the border. Another immigration lawyer, Brad Bernstein, has taken to TikTok to debunk concerns and offer advice to travelers with green cards.Here’s what to know about the rights a green card holder is entitled to and how to travel on a green card.What Rights Do Green Card Holders Have?Lawful permanent residents, who are often referred to as “green card holders,” are allowed to live and work in the United States, receive Social Security, Medicare and college financial aid, and serve in the military, according to the Department of Homeland Security.They may also apply for citizenship after five years of legal permanent residency, or three years if they marry a U.S. citizen. Residents must be in the United States for at least 913 days in that five-year period to maintain eligibility for citizenship, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency of the Department of Homeland Security.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
