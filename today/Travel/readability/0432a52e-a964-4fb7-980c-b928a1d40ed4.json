  "description": "The monstrous site of Cresson Sanatorium and Prison is situated on land donated by steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie. Established by an Act of Assembly in June 1910, the Cresson Tuberculosis Sanatorium opened in 1913. Due to the vast sprawling land and fresh air, it was deemed ideal for the treatment of the quickly spreading disease: tuberculosis. Decades later, with the introduction of new pharmaceutical aids, sanatoriums were on the decline and ultimately deemed unnecessary.  In December 1956, Cresson was incorporated into the Lawrence F. Flick State Hospital. This former tuberculosis ward would now facilitate the care of the mentally unstable under the Department of Public Welfare until December of 1982. In 1983, Cresson was converted into a state correctional facility by the Bureau of Corrections under executive order 1983-1 by Governor Dick Thornburgh. The redesign of Cresson to accommodate these needs would cost $20.6 million and began in 1984. These newly revised plans for inmate housing would serve as the template for similar institutions erected across the state. In 1987, Cresson opened its doors to inmate populations. It officially closed on June 30, 2013. The sanatorium and prison is now known for its purportedly haunted status, with reports of eerie sound and apparitions in its halls.",
