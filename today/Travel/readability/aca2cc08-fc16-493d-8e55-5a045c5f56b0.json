Prices varied depending on loyalty status, ranging from $550 or 75,000 miles to $650 to 85,000 miles annually. Now, United is introducing a two-tiered membership plan. The individual membership, which allows one member unlimited entry only to United Club locations, will cost $750 or 94,000 miles. The All Access membership will be $1,400 or 175,000 miles and covers two adults (or an adult and dependent children) and provides entry to Star Alliance and other partner lounges. Discounts are available for elite status holders.For United Club credit card holders, who used to pay a $525 annual fee, club membership has been free. The annual fee has increased, as of today, to $695. The United Club Business Card, which previously cost $450 and also included free club membership, will also be $695. The airline said in an email to customers that the Club membership changes were designed to “keep improving your experience,” noting that the new tiers were “tailored to your travel needs.” The new policies go into effect Monday, but current members won’t see immediate changes; their benefits remain until their membership expires.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
