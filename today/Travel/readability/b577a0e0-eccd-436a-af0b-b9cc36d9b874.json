  "description": "Designed in the shape of an 8—Martin Richard's favorite number—Martin's Park on the Smith Family Waterfront in Boston honors its namesake's welcoming, playful spirit. Martin was only 8 years old when he was killed in the Boston Marathon Bombing in 2013. Right next to Boston Children's Museum, the tree walk and herb garden at Martin's Park support the environment while a replica ship ignites youngsters' imaginations. The park also features a bridge, water area, individual and group swings, slides, rope climbers, and more. All structures are designed to ensure children of limited physical, social/emotional, sensory, cognitive, and communication abilities can enjoy their visit.  Martin Richard has gone before us, but his legacy lives on in this park that celebrates all of its visitors.",
