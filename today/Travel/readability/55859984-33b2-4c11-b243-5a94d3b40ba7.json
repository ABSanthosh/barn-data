Here’s a primer on where to go, stay and eat.A three-hour bus ride from Sapporo, Niseko United is a favorite among American skiers, particularly because it accepts the Ikon Pass.Credit...Chang W. Lee/The New York TimesFeb. 11, 2025Updated 2:49 p.m. ETUnlike the high jinks and vibrant après-ski scene that permeate the Alps and Rockies, Japan offers a meditative experience on its slopes. Skiing here is an almost reverent affair.“It’s not about lounging in the sun or partying between runs,” said Sari Levy, 46, who lives in Telluride, Colo., and just returned from her second ski trip to Japan. “It’s all about the snow and ski, ski, ski.”There’s hardly been a better time to follow that directive. Japan is currently enjoying a banner ski season. The Hakuba Valley, the country’s largest ski area, has already recorded an impressive 370 inches of powder, marking its snowiest season in over a decade. With resorts staying open well into April and possibly May, there’s ample opportunity to carve fresh tracks.And what tracks! Japan is known for taking Western institutions — whether whiskey, jazz or 7-Eleven stores — and refining them into something of its own. Skiing is no exception. Introduced to Japan in 1911 by a major in the Austro-Hungarian army, Theodor von Lerch, on Mount Kanaya, skiing has become an integral part of the nation’s outdoor culture, with more than 500 resorts on its mountainous islands.At the heart of Japan’s ski experience is the snow itself: light, dry and delightfully abundant. This divine powder, known as “Japow,” is the result of Siberian Arctic wind sweeping across the Sea of Japan, where it collects moisture before crashing into the towering ranges on Japan’s northern islands.For most skiers, the fluffy, dry snow that seems to fall almost daily is the stuff of dreams.With the U.S. dollar currently strong, and lift tickets, hotels and meals often more affordable than at Western resorts, a ski trip to Japan can feel like a bargain. The price of an international flight is easily outweighed by the relatively low cost of access to endless powder and excellent facilities.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
