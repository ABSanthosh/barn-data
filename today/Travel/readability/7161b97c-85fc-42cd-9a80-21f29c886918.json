We asked readers to share their stories.VideoThe sudden shutdown in global travel in March 2020 left airplanes and tourist hot spots like Paris and London eerily empty. As travel surged back months later, crowds and high prices caused many people to rethink how and where they go.CreditCredit...March 15, 2025If the sudden arrival of Covid jolted your travel plans five years ago, you are not alone.I was visiting family in Honolulu when the shutdowns began: First restaurants and bars closed, then nonessential stores, finally the beaches.As stories of stranded travelers filled the news, I panicked and jumped on a plane back to New York (looking back, I realize this seems like a dubious decision). My connecting flight from Chicago had four passengers and six cabin crew members — all maskless. At LaGuardia, dazed employees sat on the frozen baggage carousels. One worker wheeled my suitcase out from an office. It was the only checked bag.On March 19, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California issued a statewide stay-at-home order, seeking to limit the spread of the disease by curtailing nonessential travel. By March 28, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had issued a domestic travel advisory for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Nonessential travel had mostly halted by the end of the month. In April 2020, only 3.28 million passengers flew globally, a far cry from the 86.96 million in April 2019. The world would not see that many airline passengers again until the summer of 2022.Since then, we’ve ridden a roller coaster of mask mandates, social distancing, vaccines, breakthrough infections, “revenge travel” and overtourism. Travel has rebounded to prepandemic levels, according to the World Economic Forum, but Covid — and long Covid — is also still very much with us. Covid has killed at least seven million people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, and it’s still a leading cause of death in the United States.As the fifth anniversary of the pandemic approached, we asked readers to share how Covid changed the way they travel. The 762 responses we received tended to fall into five major categories: They were jumping into “life is short” travel, making up for lost time; they were focusing on family trips; they were limiting travel to avoid danger, cost, discomfort or crowds; or they weren’t traveling at all, often because of illness or fear.The responses included life transformations of all kinds. Sara Burnett, 41, of Alpine, Texas, wrote that she spent four months in Egypt learning to free dive, and now dives for Team U.S.A. “I went from doing nothing to extreme sport athlete,” she wrote.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
