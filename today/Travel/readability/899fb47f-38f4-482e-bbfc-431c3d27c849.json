  "description": "Roadside attractions are not that easy to find in Spain, but if there's one thing there's no shortage of is random art installations on roundabouts. For decades, they allowed local town halls to flaunt strange and hard-to-explain artistic offerings. The traffic circle with the giant green gummy bear at the entrance to the suburb of Las Encinas in Boadilla del Monte near Madrid is probably one of the best examples. The 22-foot (seven-meter) tall sculpture is the work of Spanish pop artist Eladio Mora, whose artist name is dEmo. Mora is also artist behind Spain's Good Luck Frog, which can be seen in the Plaza de Colón area in the center of Madrid. In 2006, residents of this area of Boadilla del Monte were surprised to see workers installing this massive green bear in the roundabout that connects the Boadilla-Majadahonda highway. El Oso Verde (\"the Green Bear\") is entirely hollow and was created by the artist using fiberglass and polyester. The bear's heart contains a tree that is a darker shade of green. The author's signature and the work's completion date are visible on the back of the bear's right leg.",
