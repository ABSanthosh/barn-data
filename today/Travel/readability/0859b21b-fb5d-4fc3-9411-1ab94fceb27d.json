  "description": "McClellan Viewpoint is a favorite stop for travelers in southern Washington State. It offers a commanding view of the famous Mount Saint Helens and its surrounding forests. Most travelers would continue their journey after taking in this vista and perhaps reading the interpretive signs. However, McClellan hides another natural wonder, just a short distance off the main highway. Across the road, unmarked by any sign, is a quarter mile primitive footpath that goes 200 vertical feet down into the canyon. Climbing down this path will require careful navigation and crossing several downed trees. Those who make it to the end of this short but difficult trail will find a massive, roaring waterfall, spilling 25 cubic feet of water per second over a 143 foot drop. Flanked by smaller falls, all feeding a verdant forest pool surrounded by moss and ferns, it is a gorgeous sight to behold. This waterfall, unofficially named McClellan Falls, flows year-round and is a segment of Curly Creek, a tributary of the Lewis River. It remains unknown to most passersby, and goes unmentioned by many maps of the area. It is one of those rare places that still feels undiscovered.",
