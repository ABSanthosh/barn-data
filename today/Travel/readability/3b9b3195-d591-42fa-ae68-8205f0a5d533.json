I mean, I probably I wasn’t even going to even need it, right? Wrong. While most of my travels over the past seventeen years have gone smoothly, I’ve definitely had plenty of mishaps too, from missed flights to broken gear to serious medical emergencies. That’s why, these days, I never leave home without travel insurance. Not only does it offer peace of mind (to both me and my loved ones), but it ensures I’m made whole should something unexpected happen. Understandbly, I get a lot of questions about travel insurance. It’s a complex topic (and, if we’re being honest, a boring one that most people don’t want to research). Where things get especially complicated is when older travelers try to find a plan. Every week, I get emails from travelers in their 60s, 70s, and beyond asking for input on their policy options. This isn’t just because insurance is complicated (though it is). It’s because prices often skyrocket once you hit 65, and a lot of insurance companies don’t even cover travelers over the age of 70! So, to help you plan your golden years of travel, here are a few of the most common questions I get about travel insurance for older travelers: Table of Contents1. What Does Travel Insurance For Older Travelers Cover?2. What is the Age Limit for Travel Insurance for Older Travelers??3. How Much is Travel Insurance for Older Travelers?4. I Want to Go on a Cruise. What Travel Insurance Company is Best?5. The Two Best Companies for Older Travelers   1. What Does Travel Insurance For Older Travelers Cover? While every policy is different, a good plan will include the following: Medical coverage for at least $100,000 USD ($250,000 USD would be better though) Emergency evacuation coverage (at least $250,000 USD) Coverage for lost, damaged, or stolen possessions, like jewelry, baggage, documents, etc. Some coverage for your electronics Coverage for cancelations for hotels, flights, and other transportation bookings if you have a sudden illness, death in the family, or other emergency Coverage for political emergencies or natural disasters that may cause you to head home early Financial protection if any company you are using goes bankrupt 24/7 customer assistance In short, you want a policy that covers medical emergencies, your possessions and purchases, and provides 24/7 support. The most bare-bones plans generally cover medical emergencies, but not your bookings or possessions. If you’re a super frugal young traveler in your twenties, that might be fine. Personally, now that I’m older and travel with more valuables (and sometimes book nicer accommodations), I like to have coverage for my possessions and bookings too. Better safe than sorry, if you ask me!   2. What is the Age Limit for Travel Insurance for Older Travelers?? Unfortunately, travel insurance companies usually have age caps on their policies: 65–69 for most, though some offer insurance for those 70–75. For example, SafetyWing, my personal go-to travel insurance company, caps its plans at age 69. World Nomads, another popular company I’ve used for decades, has an age cap of 70. As a result, prices skyrocket once you hit 65. Since older travelers often have more health issues than younger ones, and since travel insurance is a for-profit industry, policy costs are higher for older travelers. It’s not fair, I know, especially since a lot of older travelers are perfectly healthy. But that’s just something to keep in mind when comparing plans.   3. How Much is Travel Insurance for Older Travelers? Prices vary based on your age, destination, and where you live, so there’s no “one price fits all” answer. However, travelers in their sixties and above should be prepared to spend at least $125 USD per month for a very basic plan. If you want more comprehensive medical coverage, as well as “cancel for any reason” coverage, prices can jump to over $400 USD per month.   4. I Want to Go on a Cruise. What Travel Insurance Company is Best? If cruises are your primary travel style, these three companies are worth checking out: Travel Guard – Travel Guard has specific cruise insurance policies, which makes it simpler than trying to find an add-on to another non-cruise-centric policy. It covers any emergency travel assistance, trip interruption, delay, and cancelation. VisitorsCoverage – VisitorsCoverage is an insurance marketplace with a specific cruise section that compares different plans, including the popular SafeCruise plan by IMG. This plan is designed for cruise travelers and includes everything you might need, including the add-on for “cancel for any reason” coverage. InsureMyTrip – InsureMyTrip is another insurance marketplace with a cruise-specific section. You can put in your dates, destination, and the cost of your trip, and it’ll pull up a variety of plans with pricing and coverage listed in an easy comparison format.   5. The Two Best Companies for Older Travelers Since older travelers have different needs when it comes to travel insurance, it’s important that you find a company that covers those needs. Here are what I think are the best travel insurance companies for older travelers: InsureMyTrip InsureMyTrip is an insurance aggregator that allows you to compare policies from over twenty companies. This is the best place for older travelers to shop around to get a quote. You’ll be able to search for policies that cover those your age, as well as offer “cancel for any reason” plans (an important perk for any older travelers with health concerns or who are booking expensive trips and don’t want to risk losing that money). Additionally, IMT also offers policies that cover certain preexisting conditions (which is a huge plus and something most other companies don’t include). Here’s a quick overview of IMT: Comparisons of plans from over 20 companies Guaranteed low prices Coverage for travelers over 65 “Anytime advocates” ask the insurer to give your claim a second look if you think it was unfairly denied Learn More! Medjet Medjet isn’t an insurance company but rather a membership program that offers comprehensive emergency medical transportation. As a member, you get 24/7 access to hundreds of air ambulances and expert medical transport escorts and staff, located all over the world. Why do I think this is a must-have for older travelers? First, while most insurance companies make sure you get to the “nearest acceptable facility” after an injury, Medjet ensures you get home. That means you won’t have to spend time in a foreign medical facility and can get back to your primary care physician right away. Second, most travel insurance companies will only evacuate you should there be turmoil or a natural disaster if the government says things are unsafe. If the government doesn’t declare an emergency, travel insurance doesn’t have to evacuate you, forcing you to pay out of pocket if you don’t feel safe. That’s not the case with Medjet. If you feel you need to be evacuated, they’ll make sure you get home safely. Finally, it has a high age cap (with coverage up to age 84), which is rare in the travel insurance industry. Here’s a quick overview of Medjet: Extensive medical transport coverage Offers regular coverage up to age 74 (with extended coverage up to age 84) Coverage for COVID-19 Limited time spent in foreign medical facilities Both short-term and annual plans Available to residents of the US, Canada, and Mexico Learn More! *** I never leave home without travel insurance. It’s a lesson I’ve learned the hard way, and one I’m more adamant about as I get older. I think everyone should buy travel insurance before they travel — regardless of age. However, older travelers in particular should make sure they have the coverage they need in case something goes awry. While the policy options are more expensive (and sometimes less robust), there are still plenty of affordable plans to ensure you are protected as you enjoy your golden years of travel. Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner. It’s my favorite search engine because it searches websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is being left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as it consistently returns the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are: SafetyWing (best for everyone) InsureMyTrip (for those 70 and over) Medjet (for additional evacuation coverage) Want to Travel for Free? Travel credit cards allow you to earn points that can be redeemed for free flights and accommodation — all without any extra spending.

If you feel you need to be evacuated, they’ll make sure you get home safely. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, it has a high age cap (with coverage up to age 84), which is rare in the travel insurance industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere’s a quick overview of Medjet: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExtensive medical transport coverage \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOffers regular coverage up to age 74 (with extended coverage up to age 84) \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCoverage for COVID-19 \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLimited time spent in foreign medical facilities\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBoth short-term and annual plans \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAvailable to residents of the US, Canada, and Mexico\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ccenter\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medjetassist.com/nomadicmatt\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLearn More!\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003ccenter\u003e***\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never leave home without travel insurance. It’s a lesson I’ve learned the hard way, and one I’m more adamant about as I get older. I think everyone should buy travel insurance before they travel — regardless of age. However, older travelers in particular should make sure they have the coverage they need in case something goes awry. While the policy options are more expensive (and sometimes less robust), there are still plenty of affordable plans to ensure you are protected as you enjoy your golden years of travel. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eBook Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBook Your Flight\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nFind a cheap flight by using \u003ca href=\"https://skyscanner.pxf.io/c/214481/1027991/13416?subId1=%26currency%3DUSD\u0026amp;associateid=AFF_TRA_19354_00001\u0026amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skyscanner.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eSkyscanner\u003c/a\u003e.
