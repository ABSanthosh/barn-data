  "description": "The Umm Al Quwain Wall, built during the reign of Sheikh Abdullah bin Rashid I in 1820, is a 9750-foot-long defensive wall, complete with shooting holes and three watchtowers. This wall stretches across the narrow point in the peninsula, and it was meant to protect the residents of the Umm Al Quwain settlement from invaders coming over land or from the sea. The wall and towers were renovated at some point, and a small park was built, with walking paths. However, it has since started to fall into disrepair. But since the towers and walls are starting to shed some of its outer coating, you can see the corals that were used in its construction.",
