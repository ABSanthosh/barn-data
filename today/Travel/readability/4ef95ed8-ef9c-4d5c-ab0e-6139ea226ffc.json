  "description": "One of San Fernando, La Union's most popular attraction is a statue of Christ the Redeemer, which towers above the town. Beside it though, right beside the staircase heading to the statue is an interesting sight: a house with its fence all made out of seashells. The house belongs to Navalta family, as indicated on the archway above the gate. The sea shells are of various size, from as small as a coin to cover the intervals to giant clams placed on prominent sections that looks like crowns from afar. This is a private residence but the fence can be appreciated from outside from the street level. Take the staircase on the left side of the gate in the direction of the statue to see the interior section of the fence and the giant clams placed on the top of the fence of towards the back of the house.",
