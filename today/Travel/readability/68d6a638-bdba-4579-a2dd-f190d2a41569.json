  "description": "Aloe is a broadly used plant in cosmetics, medicine, food, and much more. Coupled with the fact that it is an easy-to-grow succulent, this makes it the ideal product to farm in warm places. Sitting at the foot of the Langeberg Mountain range, Albertinia known as the home of aloe. The plants are prolific here and the leaves are collected and drained for their useful properties. While there are many aloe farms, there is only one aloe statue of this size.  Unveiled in 2010, this nine-meter-tall statue depicts Aloe ferox, also known as Cape Aloe or bitter aloe. It was created by Dirk van Wyk and Froncois de Wet. The aloe statue weighs over 2,500 kilograms. Around it grow normal sized aloe plants. Typically growing to a height of no more than three meters, they are dwarfed by their sculpted counterpart.",
