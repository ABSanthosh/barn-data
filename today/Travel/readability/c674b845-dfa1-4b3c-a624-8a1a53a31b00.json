  "description": "In 2022, Warsaw's Bemowo district welcomed six new residents in some of its most-visited spots. These tiny bronze sculptures, known jointly as \"Bemisie\" (\"misie\" is a Polish word of endearment meaning \"cute little bears\"), were actually a winning project proposed by the locals in a participatory budgeting program. All six bears represent different themes related to Bemowo's past and current traditions. Most of them revolve around its sports and military heritage, as this area of Warsaw has always had ties with the Polish Army. Bemik, located in the park surrounding abandoned 19th-century fortifications known as Fort Bema, invites passers-by to try kayaking on the preserved moat. Ratowniś, a bear lifeguard, stations next to a swimming pool. Latacz, located by a primary school in the close vicinity of the former military airport Babice, sports a stylish aviator hat. Radarek commemorates the now-demolished transatlantic telegraph installations built in this area in the 1920s, while Watek poses as a student of the nearby Military University of Technology. Last but not least, Ringo, also placed by a local school, pays tribute to Włodzimierz Strzyżewski, a Bemowo resident who invented the game of ringo in 1959. Due to their minuscule dimensions, Bemisie can be hard to spot, but it only adds to the fun. Taking a walk around the district to find them all is a perfect way to learn more about this relatively little-known part of Warsaw.",
