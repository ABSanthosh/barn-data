That means no fancy drones, hefty DSLR cameras, bulky headphones, GoPros, or chunky hiking boots. If it doesn’t fit in my 40L backpack, it stays home. It’s why you hardly ever see me write posts on gear or suitcases. I’m a simple person: I got one backpack, I throw some clothes in it, and I’m off. But the clothes…well, the clothes are important. I abuse my clothes a lot. I carry only a few outfits with me and they get sweated on, washed and dried a lot, and worn out. On most long-term trips, I come home with a few less clothes than I brought. One brand that stands up to my abuse? Unbound Merino. I’ve been wearing their clothing on the road (and at home) for years now. I met the founder at an event in Toronto about eight years ago and he said, “Check out these clothes!” and I was like, “Sure,” because I wanted to be nice. But I ended up loving them. They held up in the wash, were lightweight and breathable, and fit really well, So, in this post, I’m going to talk about what makes them unique and why I think you should get them. Table of ContentsWhat Is Unbound Merino?What I Like About UnboundMy Favorite Unbound ClothesPros of Unbound Merino ClothingCons of Unbound Merino ClothingUnbound Merino FAQ   What Is Unbound Merino? Unbound is a small, independent clothing company that started in Canada. As avid travelers, the founders realized quickly that on-the-road clothing needed to be durable, versatile, and comfortable. At the time, merino wool (from merino sheep, who produce an ultrafine wool) was only really used in activewear. While those kinds of clothes are fine if you’re out on a hike, it’s not exactly the kind of clothing you might want to wear on a walking tour in Southeast Asia or visiting museums in Europe. But Unbound took the versatile fabric that is merino wool and used it to create a line of travel wear suitable for all kinds of trips, from backpacking excursions to weekend getaways. Their goal was to design shirts that would last. Sure, that means they are more expensive, but you’re paying for quality and durability. In the long run, that’s actually going to save you money (and it’s better for the planet too). I’ve been wearing Unbound clothes for about eight years now and have never been disappointed. It’s durable, comfortable, and stylish — everything I want when I’m traveling!   What I Like About Unbound These travel clothes are some of the most versatile on the market. Made from merino wool, Unbound Merino clothing can be worn daily for weeks without getting smelly. Seriously! Since merino wool is antibacterial, it is really hard to stink up your clothing — even if you’re in warmer climates. In fact, one of the cofounders wore the same shirt for 46 days before he washed it — and it still didn’t smell. That’s crazy! The clothing is wrinkle resistant too, which is a huge plus if you’re traveling carry-on only, like me. Cramming your clothes into a backpack usually leads to everything getting wrinkled and bunched up. With Unbound, that problem is nipped in the bud. Additionally, the clothes are super lightweight (again, great for carry-on-only travelers). When you’re on the road for weeks (or months) at a time, every pound matters. Lighter clothes mean you won’t have to lug around a super heavy suitcase or backpack. To me, that’s a win. And finally, the clothes look stylish. The monochrome colors of most of Unbound’s gear makes it easy to wear out to dinner, to museums, on walking tours, and everything in between.   My Favorite Unbound Clothes Here are a few of my favorite Unbound clothes. These are clothes I bring on pretty much every trip I take: Merino Crew Neck T-Shirt – These are my go-to travel shirts. They are comfy, breathable, and perfect for pretty much any destination. They are casual enough for days on the beach and nice enough to wear to museums or out to dinner. If I’m traveling, chances are I have a couple in my backpack. Long Sleeve Merino Crew – This is the long-sleeve version of the above shirt, which are perfect for cooler temps. I wear these when I’m strolling around Europe in the evenings or going somewhere where I need something a bit nicer than a t-shirt (while still being casual). Travel Pants – I’ve worn these on hikes, all around Europe, traveling around Asia — you name it. They are the perfect balance of comfy and durable. I bring them on all my trips. I can’t recommend them enough.   Pros of Unbound Merino Clothing High-quality, stylish, and versatile Odor and wrinkle resistant Lightweight and comfortable Breathable and moisture wicking Stays warm even when wet (helpful if you’re trekking in a rainforest or just get caught in a downpour) Cons of Unbound Merino Clothing Higher up-front cost Takes some care to keep your clothing lasting longer Unbound Merino FAQ Is Unbound Merino mulesing free? Yes. Mulesing (also known as live lamb cutting) is the removal of strips of wool-bearing skin from the back end of a sheep to prevent parasitic infections. It’s a controversial practice that’s seen as inhumane by many, which is why Unbound Merino only works with independent, mulesing-free farms. Isn’t wool clothing itchy? Nope! Merino wool is different from the traditional kind. It’s a lot softer and finer, so it doesn’t itch. How do I wash and care for Unbound Merino clothes? When you feel like your clothes are ready for a wash, you’ll want to turn them inside out to prevent pilling and follow the specific instructions on the tag for that piece. You can also hand-wash your clothing, which can be easier if you’re traveling and just need to wash one thing. It’s recommended to lay your clothing flat on a towel or rack to air-dry. Never put merino wool clothes in the dryer — it will shrink! Are there any disadvantages to merino wool and Unbound Merino clothing? Because of their high quality and attention to ethical manufacturing practices, Unbound Merino clothes are more expensive than you might be used to paying for a T-shirt or pair of pants. However, because of that, they last way longer (and perform better) than the cheaper alternatives. You end up spending less over time and don’t have to buy new clothing as often — which is a win in my book! *** I love my Unbound clothes. Comfortable, versatile, and stylish, they are a must for any trip. No matter where you’re going or what you’re doing, chances are Unbound has something for you.
