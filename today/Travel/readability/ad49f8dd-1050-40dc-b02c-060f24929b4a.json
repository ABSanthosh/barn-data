IHG Hotels \u0026 Resorts reports seeing double-digit-percentage increases in holiday weekend travel bookings in areas like the California wine country and Palm Beach, Fla. According to the Airlines Reporting Corporation, which tracks data that covers about two-thirds of global sales, domestic travel is up 4 percent this year, and fewer Americans are planning trips abroad this summer — which could make U.S. destinations particularly crowded. Disruptions related to air traffic control at Newark Liberty International Airport in recent weeks, which could reverberate across the U.S. air travel industry, and recent air crashes have exacerbated the nervousness.With increased demand on the beleaguered aviation industry, here’s what to know about traveling this holiday weekend.The Real ID transition has been smooth, so farThe impact of the May 7 Real ID deadline has not prevented most passengers from flying, but could still lead to delays at security checkpoints. The T.S.A. said this month that it planned to conduct additional screening for travelers without the federally compliant state-issued identification “until it is no longer considered a security vulnerability.”Rebecca Alesia, a travel adviser with SmartFlyer in New York City, said that while many airports are separating those without Real ID cards for extra screening, it is still most efficient to carry a passport if you don’t have a Real ID. Mr. Vlitas said he applied for a passport card — an acceptable Real ID substitute that has no pages and can be used at land and sea crossings with Canada, Mexico, Bermuda and some Caribbean countries — so as to not have to carry his passport.Travelers who anticipate having any issues with identification would be wise to budget for extra time in line.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
