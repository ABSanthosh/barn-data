  "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-als-raiers",
  "description": "In the wooded, cliffside Pallars Sobirà region, two stick figure-like monuments can be spotted from N-260 Road. Both depict two minimalistic and angular figures balancing on a wooden raft, each holding a long pole, symbolizing the traditional raiers of Catalonia. The raiers were log rafters who transported timber by navigating rafts down the region's rivers, particularly the Noguera Pallaresa and Segre. The first mention of this practice dates back to the 9th century, when simpler rafts were used. They were made by binding sections of wooden logs together in parallel, and were typically guided by two raiers. Historically, rafts served a dual purpose, functioning both as a means of transport for goods, and as a commodity in and of itself. At their destination, the logs making up the rafts were taken apart and sold. Catalan raiers navigated the rivers of the Pyrenees, reaching towns such as Pobla de Segur, Tremp, Balaguer, Lleida, Tortosa, and Amposta, depending on the specific river route they followed. This practice persisted through the centuries up to the early 20th century, when technology and infrastructure offered better alternatives, making the practice unprofitable. As a result, timber merchants gradually abandoned river transport, with the last active raiers in the Catalan Pyrenees making their final descent on the Segre River in 1932 and 1933. The Associació Cultural dels Raiers de la Noguera Pallaresa organizes annual events to celebrate and preserve the raiers’ legacy. One of the most notable is the Diada dels Raiers, held in early July in La Pobla de Segur, where participants recreate the traditional descent of the river on wooden rafts.",
