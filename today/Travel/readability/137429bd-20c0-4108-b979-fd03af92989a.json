It has established tiger conservation programs, and brought back wildlife to areas decimated by bloody civil unrest.All those are among the surprising programs affected by the Trump administration’s possible shutdown of the United States Agency for International Development, which, in addition to its other work, has established and maintained overseas national parks and conservation areas.That role now has an uncertain future. On Thursday, U.S.A.I.D. leaders found out that the Trump administration planned to cut nearly all jobs at the agency and cancel hundreds of grants and contracts. Congressional Democrats say any move to eliminate the agency could be illegal.National parks have proved to be a stabilizing force for countries around the world, creating local businesses and jobs, protecting fragile ecosystems and kick-starting tourism efforts and other economic opportunities. Communities around parks and preserves often benefit from new or improved health services and schools. The financial benefits may diminish the need for local people to migrate, either internally or overseas.In Colombia, the Destination Nature Activity ecotourism program preserves forest and natural habitats in six regions previously occupied by guerrillas, paramilitary groups and drug traffickers. The five-year, $40 million program, entirely funded by U.S.A.I.D., supports the operations and infrastructure to attract international travelers. One of the habitats being developed encompasses the Ciudad Perdida, older than Machu Picchu in Peru, in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta range.ImageIn Colombia, the Destination Nature Activity ecotourism program preserves forest and natural habitats in six regions previously occupied by guerrillas, paramilitary groups and drug traffickers.
