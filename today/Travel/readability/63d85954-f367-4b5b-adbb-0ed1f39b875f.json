  "description": "Since early history spring water was considered to have healing properties, with many locations in Scotland becoming famous for their healing or holy wells. Brow Well is a chalybeate spring that flows with naturally iron-salt-rich water. This water was believed to cure a whole host of illnesses. During the 17th century it became fashionable to visit spas with mineral springs in the pursuit of health and beauty. When Scottish poet Robert Burns’ health began to decline in 1796, he visited Brow Well to take its waters and sea bathe nearby. He actually died soon after, but the well became a place for enthusiasts of his poetry to come and contemplate his works. An annual commemoration takes place here each July. The well now has lines from his poetry running around the edge of the pool.",
