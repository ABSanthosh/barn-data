  "description": "Since skateboarding first emerged in the 1940s and 50s, the sport has evolved a lot. The boards are more advanced and the tricks are bigger, faster, and more complex. One thing that hasn't changed much over time though, is the urge to put art on the bottom of the boards. You can see this in the collection at the Geneva Skateboard Museum, which showcases boards from different eras of skateboarding. The museum is made and run by Jim Zbinden, who has had the dream of this museum in mind for nearly 30 years. The first iteration of the museum came in the early 2000s. Hundreds of skateboards were displayed to show the intricate and unique art that has been a part of skateboarding culture for the last seven decades.  In the museum's current location, you'll find three floors where each inch of wall and ceiling space is covered with skateboards and skateboard paraphernalia. The collection has everything from old used boards to new display boards to boards that belonged to famous skaters like Tony Hawk. This makes the museum interesting even for those who have never touched a skateboard in their lives.",
