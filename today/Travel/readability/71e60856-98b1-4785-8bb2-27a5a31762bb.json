  "description": "Dalkey Island is an uninhabited island off the coast of Dalkey, not too far from Dublin. Once a Viking outpost and later a Christian holy site, Dalkey has a long history of use. A short walk from the dock, there are the 7th century ruins of St Begnet's Church, and farther on, an old fort as well as a tower from the Napoleonic period. The island hosts wonderful rock scrambling and spectacular views. There are rabbit holes and rabbits all over the island. One visitor claimed to have watched a rabbit scale a brick wall like some kind of vampire. A herd of goats live here, as well as numerous seals who occupy the rocks and the surrounding waters. Walking along the shoreline closest to Dalkey, one can also find the ruins of St. Begnet’s Well. Ancient Christians would make a pilgrimage here to get healed by the waters.  It was also called \"scurvy well\" as it was rumored to provide relief from that ailment for sailors.",
