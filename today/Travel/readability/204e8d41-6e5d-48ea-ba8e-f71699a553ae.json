After calling again to plead for assistance later that afternoon, the four were moved using wheelchairs to the clinic and then by ambulance to a hospital.At the hospital, his 8-year-old son, Oliver, went into cardiac arrest and died. April, 41, died while unconscious on a ventilator. Mr. Gougeon and his son Wesley, then 6, were hospitalized for two days.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
