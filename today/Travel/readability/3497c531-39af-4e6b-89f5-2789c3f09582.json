While I may be biased (I grew up here), I think more people should visit — especially history buffs and foodies. Whether you’re strolling the cobblestone streets of Beacon Hill, exploring the bustling Seaport District, or enjoying the iconic views along the Charles River, the city has a lot to offer (don’t skip the Freedom Trail!). And when it comes to finding a place to stay, Boston’s has a ton of options catering to every type of traveler and budget. But some of those hotels are better than others. Others should be avoided entirely. To help you find the perfect base for your stay, here is my list of the best hotels in Boston: 1. The Godfrey Hotel Boston The Godfrey Hotel is a stylish boutique hotel in the heart of downtown. One thing I really like here is that they offer complimentary bikes, helmets, and locks, which is great for covering more ground when out exploring. They also have a fitness center with Peloton bikes. When it comes to breakfast, they have an on-site café offering pastries, fresh coffee, and breakfast sandwiches. The hotel restaurant is really good as well (it’s a Peruvian Japanese fusion place with a cool interior and great cocktails). For a quick nightcap, the hotel lobby bar is a nice option, and I love that they give you a complimentary welcome drink too. The rooms are sleek and minimalist, offering comfy beds with plush linens and windows that let in lots of natural light (there are also blackout curtains so you can get a good night’s sleep). I appreciate the well-thought-out amenities, including a handy workspace, mini-fridges, 55” Samsung HDTV, BOSE Bluetooth speakers, and yoga mats. The bathrooms are equally impressive, featuring glass-enclosed showers, high-end toiletries, and soft robes. Overall, the central location, chic design, and solid amenities make this hotel an excellent choice for travelers looking for comfort and convenience in the heart of the city. Book here!   2. Staypineapple Boston This quirky and fun boutique hotel is located in Back Bay, just steps from the Boston Common and within walking distance of many of the city’s top attractions. The hotel’s design is bold and vibrant, with pineapple-themed décor throughout. Don’t worry, it looks better than you’d think and adds a playful twist to the otherwise classic, early 20th-century building. I like that when you check in, you get a free welcome drink at the hotel’s bar/restaurant, and in the afternoons, there’s free coffee, tea, and light snacks in the lobby. While there’s no breakfast offered on-site, there are plenty of breakfast places nearby. Plus, the hotel offers free bikes that you can use to get around the city. The rooms here are compact but well-designed, making the most of the space with an efficient layout. Like the rest of the hotel, the rooms are bright and colorful, with playful pineapple accents, comfy beds with soft bedding, and thoughtful amenities like Keurig coffee makers, fluffy robes, slippers, and a small desk. I also like that they provide a reusable water bottle filled with filtered water in the rooms (you can take it with you or leave it and they’ll recycle it when you leave). The bathrooms are sleek and new, featuring glass-enclosed showers, quality toiletries, and huge plush towels. Overall, this is a great choice for travelers looking for a unique, budget-friendly stay in a prime location. It’s an especially great option if you’re traveling with pets, as they’re known for their dog-friendly rooms and facilities. Book here!   3. The Langham A five-star hotel housed in a landmarked former Federal Reserve Bank, this unique hotel offers a blend of historic charm and modern luxury. I love walking through the grand entranceway into the stunning lobby bedecked with grand chandeliers and marble accents. The former bank hall is now the hotel’s signature restaurant, Grana, which offers classic and unique Italian meets New-England dishes (think lobster cannoli) as well as a fantastic breakfast spread featuring everything from freshly baked pastries to more indulgent options like Florentine benedict. I really love their British-inspired cocktail bar, the Fed, too. They serve excellent cocktails, elevated pub fare, and even have free jazz every Friday. There’s also a high-tech fitness center that’s open 24/7 as well as a beautiful (and heated) indoor pool with a sauna for when you want to unwind. The huge, opulent rooms feature lavish bedding, curated artwork from local artists, sleek furniture, and large windows that let in plenty of natural light. In-room amenities include a large work desk, Nespresso machine, a well-stocked minibar (I like that it’s filled with local goodies), safe, and a 50” flatscreen TV. The bathrooms in the rooms are equally spacious and beautifully designed, with luxurious marble finishes, and walk-in rainfall showers (some rooms also have deep soaking tubs). The Langham is a great pick for travelers looking for a centrally located hotel that blends old-world charm with modern comforts. Look no further if you want to splurge! Book here!   4. Seaport Hotel Boston Located right along the water, this four-star hotel is the perfect base for exploring the waterfront, the Institute of Contemporary Art, and nearby attractions like the Boston Children’s Museum. The hotel has a sleek, contemporary design with plenty of natural light and open spaces, along with great amenities including an 11,000-square-foot 24/7 fitness center with group classes, a heated indoor pool, a steam room, and a peaceful garden area. There are three great eateries on-site here too. For breakfast, I like the fact that you can either sit down at Aura, their breakfast restaurant which offers a variety of delicious options for all diets, or take some grab-and-go fare from Seaport Café. For dinner, try TAMO Bistro + Bar, where you can enjoy a locally inspired menu (including herbs and honey from the hotel’s own rooftop garden and bee colony). Every room has a great view, either of the city or harbor. Plus, they’re spacious and comfortable, with comfy beds with pillowtop beds, a pillow menu, and even weighted blankets on request. I appreciate the reading lamps and USB ports on the headboards too. All rooms have a work desk, 55″ HD TV with streaming services, a Keurig coffee maker, mini-fridges, and laptop-sized safes. The bathrooms are large too, featuring marble countertops, large fog-free mirrors, and walk-in showers with quality bath products. If you want to stay in an area that tourists don’t typically consider, stay here. Book here!   5. The Newbury Hotel Boston This iconic five-star property, located right on Newbury Street across from the historic Boston Public Garden, is a masterpiece of classic elegance. It opened in 1927 as the first-ever Ritz Carlton Hotel and recently received an extensive two-year restoration, reopening as The Newbury. I love that it’s got this luxuriously moody feel throughout, with velvet furniture, richly colored walls, and custom artwork. I especially love the private library lounge for guests. It’s perfect for settling in with a drink and grabbing a book off the shelf to read. For breakfast, I recommend the stunning rooftop restaurant, Contessa, which offers fine dining that’s Italian meets American (with dishes like panettone French toast and carbonara scramble), though you can also get classic eggs and pancakes breakfast fare at the hotel’s Street Bar. The rooms here are spacious and thoughtfully designed, featuring custom-designed furnishings, original illustrations on the walls, and soft lighting for a calming atmosphere. Each room includes a plush king or queen bed with a high-end mattress. I especially appreciate the headboard lighting and large work desk, though there are also amenities like an in-room Nespresso machine and a fully stocked minibar. The marble bathrooms have glass-enclosed rainfall showers, bespoke toiletries, and really nice fluffy robes and towels. Everything about this place exudes luxury, making it a standout option for those seeking an upscale and relaxing stay in Boston. It’s also a prime location for exploring Back Bay’s high-end shopping, dining, and cultural attractions. Book here! *** I love Boston. I think it’s one of the greatest cities in the U.S. It has all the benefits of a big metropolis with a smaller town feel, which is why, despite all my travels, it has remained at the top of my list. Just make sure to choose one of the hotels above to ensure a memorable stay in one of America’s most historic cities! Book Your Trip to Boston: Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Use Skyscanner to find a cheap flight. They are my favorite search engine because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the biggest inventory and best deals. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels. For the best hostels, check out this post on the best hostels in the city. And if you want to know the best neighborhoods, here’s my guide to all the best areas in town! Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are: Safety Wing (best for everyone) Insure My Trip (for those over 70) Medjet (for additional evacuation coverage) Looking for the Best Companies to Save Money With?
