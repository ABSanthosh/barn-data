Frank/National Park ServiceRuffin PrevostRuffin Prevost, a journalist who lives in Cody, Wyo., has been writing about Yellowstone National Park for more than 20 years.Dec. 17, 2024, 5:00 a.m. ETIt’s no secret that Yellowstone National Park can be jampacked in the summer, when up to one million people jockey for space each July. But February typically draws fewer than 50,000 visitors. That makes winter the best time to beat the crowds, as well as to experience a captivating and seldom-seen world revealed only when the park is covered in snow.In winter, wildlife shows up in stark relief against an undulating sea of white. The roar of bus engines and clatter of motorcycles are replaced by the hiss and gurgle of flaring fumaroles and bubbling mud pots, and the quiet crunch of snow underfoot.Winter weather varies from blue-sky days in the 30s to whiteout blizzards at 20 below zero, with conditions that are often comparable to those at any Rocky Mountain ski hill. Traveling with a group is important for safety, along with dressing warmly in layers and wearing insulated, waterproof boots and gloves.Yellowstone’s winter season runs from mid-December to early March, with activities — which are all about the snow — ranging from mild to wild. Bring a separate camera with a telephoto lens, and always give animals plenty of space. Then brag to everyone about why your winter adventure was so much better than their summer visit to the world’s first national park.ImageSnow coaches with oversize, low-pressure tires give visitors a warm, comfy way to tour Yellowstone and, in some cases, to reach their accommodations.Credit...Jacob W. Frank/National Park ServiceExplore the park in a cozy snow coachSnow coaches — high-clearance passenger vans with oversize, low-pressure tires — are the coziest, most comfortable way to see Yellowstone in winter. You can opt for a tour run by Xanterra Travel Collection, and stay overnight at the Old Faithful Snow Lodge ($457 a night), which the company manages. From there, choose from six different round-trip tours (from $84), including a stargazing jaunt and a photo safari. Snow Lodge guests must book separate travel to and from the hotel (from $174 one-way). Round-trip tours also depart from Mammoth Hot Springs (from $134).Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
