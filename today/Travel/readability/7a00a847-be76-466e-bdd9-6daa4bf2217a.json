A writer explores by land and by water.Swimmers at Cala Bue Marino in Favignana, one of a group of islands near Sicily, where the water is a kaleidoscope of blue.Credit...July 9, 2025Bue Marino cove, on the east side of Favignana, an island just off the west coast of Sicily, may be the most spectacular swimming spot on an island of spectacular swimming spots.The sea proceeds along a beige cliff so chipped and cubed that it looks like a giant took a chisel to the coast. The water is a kaleidoscope of blue, with two colors dominating — cobalt over the meadows of sea grass undulating in the current, and ice-blue above the long strips of white sand. And somewhere just down the coast, I’d been told, there was a hidden maze of man-made caverns, “like a temple.”So I was swimming in search of the vaults, watching the high cliffs slope closer to the sea and the sailboats and tour boats gliding by. After a quarter mile, I saw a dark entrance about two stories high, divided by a column. I climbed onto a stone landing and entered a labyrinth of chambers the size of warehouses, hollowed over the centuries by stonecutters extracting countless blocks of limestone-like rock called calcarenite. The soft dirt floor descended into more dim, empty halls, reminding me of the tombs of the pharaohs in Egypt. Instead of hieroglyphics, the walls were covered in scars from pickaxes and disc saws.The island's distinctive rock, called calcarenite, has been hewn by stonecutters, creating caves, columns and points for jumping off into the sea. Popular with Italians but little known by foreigners, Favignana is a mostly flat, jagged island with three hallmarks: swimming, stone and tuna.Now the massive tuna factory is an inventive museum, some of the 200 former quarries have been transformed into a botanical garden, and marble streets once trodden by exhausted laborers are alive with deeply tanned, stylishly dressed Italians on vacation.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
