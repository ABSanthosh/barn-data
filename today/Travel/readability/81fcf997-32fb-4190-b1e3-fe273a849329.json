  "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/parco-naturale-di-gianola-monte-scauri",
  "description": "Hidden away in the Lazio region of Italy, about 50 miles north of Naples, the Gianola and Monte di Scauri Regional Park stretches across 292 stunning hectares. Managed by the Riviera di Ulisse Park Authority, the body that governs other nearby Atlas Obscura locations such as the Villa of Tiberius, this park is home to many ancient Roman ruins that few tourists know about. Among its notable sites is a remarkable seaside villa, dating back to around 50 BC and believed to belong to the Roman military officer Mamurra who served under Julius Caesar. Visitors can also explore the evocative Grotta della Janara, a staircase adorned with a barrel vault reminiscent of Sardinia's Domus de Janas, and the remnants of Porticciolo Romano, a small Roman port. Scattered across the landscape are five coastal towers: the ruins of Torre di Gianola and Torre Fico, alongside Torre Foce and Torre dei Mulini, which, though integrated into private properties, remain strikingly visible. The majestic Torre di Scauri, perched atop Monte d'Oro, offers breathtaking views of Minturno and the coastline.",
