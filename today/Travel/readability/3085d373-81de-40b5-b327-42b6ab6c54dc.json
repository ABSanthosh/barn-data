  "description": "On an otherwise modern street, a building that appears to be plucked straight from the early 1900s stands tall on Fisher Avenue in Poolesville, Maryland. The Old Town Hall and former National Bank of Poolesville comprise the Historic Medley District along with John Poole House and Seneca Schoolhouse. The Old Town Hall Bank Museum and Exhibit Hall has a permanent Civil War exhibit that highlights Poolesville's role in the war, including local artifacts from that era found in the town, drawings and pictures of local conflicts, and exhibits on key individuals from Poolesville who were part of the war. The building dates to 1907 and has been restored to its original appearance. In addition to the permanent exhibit, the museum presents cultural and educational programs on subjects such as African-American heritage, military tributes, art shows, bridal shows, photography contests, and explorations of local history. This slice of living history exists thanks to Historic Medley District, Inc.—a preservation project started in 1974 by 27 residents of Montgomery County, Maryland who shared concerns about the neglect and disappearance of buildings and landmarks of historical significance. The members, which now number approximately 150, have taken collective action through a multi-pronged approach of hands-on restoration, testifying before government groups, and providing expertise and guidance to the owners of the properties.",
