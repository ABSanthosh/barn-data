  "description": "In northwest Tasmania’s Mole Creek Karst National Park, you can channel your inner spelunker while exploring natural limestone caves. Located approximately half an hour from Sheffield and a little over an hour from Cradle Mountain National Park, it’s a great add-on to view this natural marvel.  This is the only national park on the island designated to protect karst landforms, which includes a network of gorges, streams, springs, sinkholes, and caves beneath the surface. The unique landscape is part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area and can be explored when you venture into the Tasmanian underworld in King Solomon’s Cave. This is one of two main caves in the park open to the public and features stalactite and stalagmite formations that dazzle.",
