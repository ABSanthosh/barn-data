Those 28 nights had revealed how much there was to discover in France beyond the endless allure of Paris.Four free days remained before my return to the United States, so I hatched a plan to rent a car and take a road trip through the south of France, with no itinerary. Though my initial concept was to travel alone, I learned that Stephen, an old friend, was in France, too, wrapping up a professional obligation of his own in Marseille. I suggested we share an adventure. His wife, who hadn’t come along for the trip, was also a good friend, and no awkward hint of romance existed in this plan of ours.It was “Two for the Road,” minus the love angle.‘Not a Plan in Our Heads’We picked up the car in Nice. A French friend suggested we start out in Èze, a nearby village celebrated for its beauty and charm. “Everyone loves Èze,” she told me.Everyone but us. What we found was far from a hidden gem. The village was lovely, but the parade of tourists filing through the winding streets lined with shops selling soap and dish towels made it clear we’d come to the wrong place. “From now on,” I told Stephen, “let’s steer clear of anyplace labeled Most Charming French Village Ever.”We headed north, not a plan in our heads. We sought small moments rather than important landmarks — great food that didn’t cost much, unexpected discoveries. I wanted to feel like a character in a French movie, I told Stephen, failing to specify what kind.We headed north. Around lunchtime, I spotted a handmade sign, “Fromage,” outside a farmhouse with goats grazing around it. The young woman inside, who looked as though she’d stepped out of a Marcel Pagnol film, brought out a selection of chèvre. Was there a place nearby to buy bread? I asked. She pointed to a dirt road on which cows were ambling. “Pas loin,” she told me. Not far. Happily, I didn’t hear a word of English in the village she directed us to.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
