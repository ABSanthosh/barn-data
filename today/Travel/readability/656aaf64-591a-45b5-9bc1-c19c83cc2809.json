Visit americanexpress.com to learn more. When I first started traveling, I lived out of hostels. They were cheap and my budget was tight. Plus, as an introvert, they were perfect for meeting fellow backpackers and getting me out of my comfort zone. I still love the vibe of hostels, but these days, running a business on the road means I often need more space and privacy. And I love sticking to one brand because you can get free breakfast, upgrades, and rooms. Whether you’re a seasoned backpacker or just an occasional traveler, having at least one hotel credit card is a game-changer. With big bonuses, free nights, and extra perks, it’s one of the best ways to save on accommodation and level up your hotel experience. That’s why today I want to highlight one of the best hotel cards out there from one of my favorite hotel brands: the Hilton Honors American Express Card. This entry level card is great for people who want a low fee card with good perks. Table of ContentsWhat is the Hilton Honors American Express Card?Complimentary Card Benefit: Hilton Honors Silver StatusUsing Your Hilton Honors PointsPros of the Hilton Honors CardCons of the Hilton Honors CardWho is this Card For? What is the Hilton Honors American Express Card? The Hilton Honors American Express Card is a hotel rewards credit card. With this card, you’ll earn 5x points at U.S. restaurants, U.S. supermarkets, and U.S. gas stations. You’ll also get 3x points on all other purchases. It has $0 annual fee (See Rates and Fees), making it great for beginners who don’t want to get a card with an annual fee right away. Here’s what the card offers: Earn 80,000 Hilton Honors Bonus Points after you spend $2,000 in purchases on the Card in the first 6 months of Card Membership. 7x points on Hilton hotels and resorts 5x points on U.S. restaurants, U.S. supermarkets, and U.S. gas stations 3x points on all other purchases Complimentary Hilton Honors™ Silver status No foreign transaction fees Extended warranty*: The card comes with an extended warranty that adds up to one year to an original manufacturer’s warranty of five years or less. Purchase protection*: Purchase protection covers items accidentally damaged, stolen or lost if you paid for them with your card. This benefit covers purchases for up to 90 days and covers up to $1,000 per item (up to $50,000 per calendar year). Car rental insurance**: When you use the card to reserve and pay for a car rental and decline the rental company’s insurance, you’re covered against damage and theft — up to $50,000. This benefit is secondary coverage to your own auto insurance and doesn’t include liability. Complimentary Card Benefit: Hilton Honors Silver Status Being a member of Hilton Honors, Hilton’s loyalty program, offers a lot of perks and benefits (based on elite status of course). To encourage travelers to always book with Hilton, Hilton Honors offers free stays, room upgrades, and other benefits that make frequent stays worthwhile. It’s free to join the program, and basic members enjoy waived resort fees on award stays as well as free Wi-Fi. Without the card, you’d earn higher status via spending a specific number of nights each year at a Hilton property. With the Hilton Honors Amex card though, you’ll get complimentary Hilton Honors Silver status (normally you’d have to stay at least 10 nights at a Hilton property within a year to earn this level of status). Silver status includes: Earn 20% more points: Earn 20% more points on eligible stays compared to base members Fifth night free on award stays: When you book four nights on points, you’ll get the fifth night free (up to a 20-night stay) Spa discounts: When staying at an all-inclusive Hilton property, you’ll get 15% off the spa Elite rollover nights: Carry over any additional nights from the current year toward earning higher elite status next year Two complimentary bottles of water per stay: Get free bottles of water at check-in (where available) While Silver is Hilton’s entry-level elite status, it provides good value, especially for infrequent travelers. I especially like the fifth night free perk, which can be used an unlimited number of times annually (though it is capped at four free nights at once, but who is staying at a hotel for 20 nights in a row?). Using Your Hilton Honors Points Unlike World of Hyatt, Hilton Honors doesn’t publish an award chart. That means that the number of points it takes to book a room for the night isn’t set. Instead, the room rate varies dynamically based on supply and demand. That means that stays can be between 5,000–150,000 points per night (150k is for the Hilton resort in the Maldives) — sometimes even more! That said, you’ll find that most stays hover around 30,000–60,000 points per night. Unfortunately, the lack of an award chart also means it’s a bit more challenging to figure out how to get the best value out of your points. You can always manually search by locations and properties you’re interested in, or use Hilton’s own Points Explorer tool to help you find stays bookable with points. You can filter by how many points you have, destination, and what type of property you’re looking to book (such as a resort or boutique hotel). However, I recommend using tools like Awayz to help you find the best deals and make the most out of your points. Awayz helps you compare the cash price to points price to determine where you’re getting the most out of your points. I’ve found some pretty great deals using it!   Pros of the Hilton Honors Card No annual fee Complimentary elite status Fifth night free on award stays Increased points earning rates at Hilton properties as well as U.S. restaurants, U.S. supermarkets, and U.S. gas stations Cons of the Hilton Honors Card Status perks are pretty basic No bonus points earned on general travel purchases Who is this Card For? This card is best for fans of the Hilton brand who want to earn free stays using a card that doesn’t carry an annual fee. If you’re fine with entry-level elite status and decent earning rates on your spending, this card could be a solid choice. But, if you’re after more flexibility with your rewards or want to unlock better Hilton perks (like free food/beverage credit or hotel lounge access), I’d suggest a mid-tier or premium Hilton card or even a more versatile travel rewards card. It’s all about matching the card to how you travel! *** Overall, the Hilton Honors American Express Card is a great option for anyone looking to dip their toes into the world of hotel loyalty programs. With no annual fee, perks like automatic Silver status, and solid earning potential on Hilton stays, it’s an easy way to start building up points without extra costs!

In this guide, I'll show you: How to Pick a Credit Card How to Earn Up to 10x Miles on Your Spending How to Redeem Your Points And a Ton of Other Money Saving Tips! Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner. It’s my favorite search engine because it searches websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is being left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as it consistently returns the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are: SafetyWing (best for everyone) InsureMyTrip (for those 70 and over) Medjet (for additional evacuation coverage) Want to Travel for Free? Travel credit cards allow you to earn points that can be redeemed for free flights and accommodation — all without any extra spending.
