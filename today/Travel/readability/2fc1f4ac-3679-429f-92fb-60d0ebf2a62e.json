Ryanair Won’t Send Money to a U.S. Bank Account. We Want What We’re Due for a Delay.After being grounded for 12 hours in Berlin, a mother and daughter were owed both compensation and a rebooked flight. All they got were nonsensical responses from customer service.Credit...Charlie PadgettJan. 3, 2025Dear Tripped Up,Last March, my daughter and I were headed from Berlin, where she was studying, to Italy for her spring break. Our 8:50 p.m. Ryanair flight to Rome was delayed for several hours and eventually postponed to the next morning at 6 a.m. We were given the address of a hotel and told we would be reimbursed for it, as well as transportation and meals, according to European air passenger protections. The hotel was full, so we found an alternative nearby for 61 euros. As a backup plan in case our flight was canceled, I reserved a second “Flexi Plus” Ryanair flight for the next evening, for $908 total, that would allow us to postpone for a future date as long as we rescheduled up to 2.5 hours before departure. Our original flight did take off at around 9 a.m., so when we finally got to Rome, we tried and tried for two hours to rebook the backup flight for another trip in May on the Ryanair app, but the “confirm changes” button just wouldn’t work. So I got in line for customer service chat — I was number 200 — but the app eventually quit on me. I then called Ryanair, but the agent told me that to reschedule the flight by phone would cost 180 euros. I declined and decided take it up with the airline again — and file for expenses — when I got home. Neither went well. I got what appeared to be an automated (nonsensical) response about the app fiasco. And the reimbursement form Ryanair has online required I submit my bank account information with an IBAN code — which American banks don’t have. When I wrote in to ask about alternatives, what also must have been an automated response ignored what I wrote and directed me back to the same form, twice. I believe Ryanair owes me about 100 euros for the hotel, taxi and meal, plus a flight for two from Berlin to Rome. Can you help? Tere, Wellesley, Mass.Dear Tere,Ryanair owes you much more than that, unless the carrier is claiming the flight was delayed because of “extraordinary circumstances.” When flights are delayed three hours or more, European law requires carriers to compensate passengers at least 250 euros each, in addition to paying for meals, transportation and lodging.You already asked for 100 euros to cover those costs, and your shortish flight qualifies you for the minimum 250 euros each, bringing the total of what Ryanair won’t let you access without that IBAN — or International Bank Account Number — to 600 euros, about $625.When I reached out to the Ryanair media office in September, it offered me an initial response saying it would look into the issue, and then subsequently ignored multiple follow-ups, including a detailed fact-checking email a week before the holidays.So you might be out of luck for that May flight to Rome. But I have a potential solution for the $625. You could open an account with an international financial services company like Wise, which offers multi-currency accounts — complete with IBAN numbers — for customers to receive payments in euros. If Ryanair deposits the money, you can either transfer that money into dollars within your Wise account (for under $3, in this case) or transfer it to your own U.S. bank account (for under $5).It shouldn’t have been that difficult though — Ryanair is required by law to pay “by cash, by electronic bank transfer, bank orders or bank cheques,” according to legislation. There is no mention of excluding Americans or other travelers whose bank accounts do not come with IBANs (or, for that matter, who spell “checks” differently). I imagine Ryanair has a way to do it, if only a human being at the carrier would talk to either of us.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
