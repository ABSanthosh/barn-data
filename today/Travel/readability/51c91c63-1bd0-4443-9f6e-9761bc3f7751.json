  "text": "Today is the day! My new book, How to Travel the World on $75 a Day, is out NOW! (Woo! Hoo!) This newly updated edition of my New York Times best-selling book will help you travel on a budget. The last edition of the book came out in 2017 and, since then, a lot has changed. COVID changed the travel industry forever. A lot of companies/hotels/hostels closed during the pandemic, including ones that had been around for decades! Old methods of saving money (like RTW tickets) became obsolete and new methods (like certain apps and sharing economy websites) came into being. Destinations changed. Prices have definitely changed. Because the travel landscape is so different, I wanted my book that reflected the current conditions we travelers face when it comes to planning a trip, saving money, and navigating regions around the world. If you’re looking to have those magical travel experiences you always hear about in books or on social media, my new book is going to help you. You’ll become an expert traveler and know how to always find deals and get off-the-beaten-path. It will lay out travel planning in a simple and easy to follow format and give you specific strategies that work no matter where you go in the world or for how long. (After all, it doesn’t matter how long you’re going away for, we all get on the same planes!) This book has my twenty years of travel wisdom distilled into one place and has tips, tricks, and resources not found on this blog. So, if you’re looking to unlock the power to go anywhere without spending a fortune, get your copy today from one of the following retailers by clicking the image below: And, if you are in Canada, you can get a copy from Indigo! What’s New in This Edition Here’s some of the new stuff you’ll find in this edition: A new section on collecting and redeeming points and miles. A completely updated resource section filled with companies and accommodations I love. More information on overtourism and how to be a responsible traveler. Completely revised and updated and expanded destination sections that include new prices, ways to save, tips on where to eat, accommodation, transportation, and activities. New trips and tricks on how to save money before you go. New ways to save money on accommodation, including ways to get free accommodation. New ways to save money on transportation (with new information on transportation passes). Here’s a detailed chapter-by-chapter breakdown: Chapter 1: Getting Over Your Fears Chapter 2: Is Travel Really Too Expensive? Chapter 3: How to Save for Your Trip Chapter 4: Banking Overseas Chapter 5: Credit Cards Chapter 6: Airline Tickets Chapter 7: Backpacks and Suitcases Chapter 8: Travel Insurance Chapter 9: What to Do with Your Stuff Chapter 10: Tips for Saving Money on Accommodations Chapter 11: Tips for Saving Money on Food and Beverages Chapter 12: Tips for Saving Money on Transportation Chapter 13: Tips for Saving Money on Activities Plus, the book also covers the major destinations of the world, like Australia, Central America, China, Europe, New Zealand, South America, Southeast Asia, and a few others!

Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner. It’s my favorite search engine because it searches websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is being left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as it consistently returns the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are: SafetyWing (best for budget travelers) World Nomads (best for mid-range travelers) InsureMyTrip (for those 70 and over) Medjet (for additional evacuation coverage) Want to Travel for Free? Travel credit cards allow you to earn points that can be redeemed for free flights and accommodation — all without any extra spending. Check out my guide to picking the right card and my current favorites to get started and see the latest best deals. Need a Rental Car? Discover Cars is a budget-friendly international car rental website. No matter where you’re headed, they’ll be able to find the best — and cheapest — rental for your trip! Need Help Finding Activities for Your Trip? Get Your Guide is a huge online marketplace where you can find cool walking tours, fun excursions, skip-the-line tickets, private guides, and more.
