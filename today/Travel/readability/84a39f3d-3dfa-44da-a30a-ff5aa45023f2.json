  "description": "A little under 150 miles from the Syrian border, Gaziantep is renowned for its distinctive cuisine. A historic melting pot, the small city has been inhabited by the Hittites, Assyrians, Persians, and Romans, among other civilizations. Few international tourists make it over to the westernmost part of the southern region of Anatolia.  Luckily, some of Gaziantep’s best-known pastries can be found far beyond the city. One of the most prized of all is Antep baklava. Just as baklava originated in Ottoman kitchens and became popular throughout the empire, the Antep version is well-known in Berlin, where a local Turkish confectioner proudly claims to make one of the best renditions outside of Gaziantep. Şengüloğlu Baklava, opened in 2009 in the German capital’s own melting pot, the multicultural neighborhood of Neukölln, and has since opened several locations around the city. For Berlin’s 250,000-some strong population of Turkish immigrants and diaspora, Şengüloğlu Baklava provides nostalgic homeland tastes. The dessert café presents the whole gamut of Turkish sweets—cakes, künefe (a cheesy pastry) and lokum (Turkish delight), plus several types of baklava. The Antep baklava here is made according to a secret family recipe which includes the traditional ingredients of phyllo dough, butter and rosewater-flavored sugar syrup. The skill with which it's made, though, is the real chef’s kiss. Just take one bite and the rich, creamy texture reveals great care and attention: flaky phyllo layered tightly, just enough syrup to not be overpowering, and the finest point, pistachios incredibly finely chopped to perfection.",
