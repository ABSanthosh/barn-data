  "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/1904-worlds-fair-swedish-pavilion",
  "description": "With its cheery yellow exterior and distinct slopping roofs, the Swedish Pavilion is architect Ferdinand Boberg's only international exposition building still standing. It is also the only example of this distinct architectural style in the United States.  The building boasts the design of a traditional Swedish Manor House, or herrgård, and honors the architectural past of Sweden. The pavilion was built as an international exposition building for the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, also known as the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, and is one of only two international buildings from the event still in existence. When the fair closed, W.W. Thomas, the U.S. Minister to Sweden and Norway, purchased the Swedish Pavilion and presented it to Bethany College. It served as a classroom, library, museum, and art department for more than 60 years under Swedish-born artist Birger Sandzén.  In 1969, the Swedish Pavilion was moved from Bethany College to the Lindsborg Old Mill and Swedish Heritage Museum on the south side of town, and some restoration was completed. The Pavilion is used for cultural heritage events throughout the year, including Heritage Christmas, Midsummer's Festival, Svensk Hyllningsfest (in odd-numbered years), and the Legend of Sleepy Hollow performances (in even-numbered years). The building was entered into the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.  Now, the museum sits on 15 acres along the Smoky Hill River and is accompanied by the 1898 Smoky Valley Roller Mills building, also on the National Register of Historic Places, as well as another eight historic buildings.  Today, the Pavilion's future is uncertain. In October 2023, an engineering assessment found that the pavilion is leaning by up to 2 degrees. This tilt is obvious even to the untrained eye and considered severe. Due to fear of structural collapse, the building is currently closed until updates can be made.",
