I always enjoy my time wandering its labyrinthine streets, enjoying the stunning ocean views, and sipping an endless flow of wine. Perched on the southern edge of the country’s west coast, Lisbon (or Lisboa, as the locals call it) offers an amazing blend of museums, historic landmarks, eclectic music scenes, vibrant nightlife, charming plazas, and cozy cafés. I fell in love with the city the moment I arrived. In recent years, Lisbon has become more popular, driven by its affordable cost of living and pleasant year-round weather. It’s also one of the best cities in the world for digital nomads (and one of my personal favorites), with a large community of expats and remote workers. With so many visitors, it should come as no surprise that Lisbon has a ton of hotels to choose from (not all of them are nice though). To help you decide where to stay, here is my list of the best hotels in Lisbon: 1. Portugal Boutique Hotel I love how this four-star hotel strikes the perfect balance between old-world elegance and contemporary flair. It has minimalist furnishings that contrast with the building’s historic architectural elements, like arched stone doorways, traditional Portuguese tiling, and hardwood floors. I especially like the wood-paneled breakfast room, where every morning they serve a complimentary breakfast made from fresh, seasonal ingredients. Definitely make sure to check out the wine cellar (you can do a tasting there), and there’s even 24-hour room service in case you get the munchies in the middle of the night. The staff is exceptionally helpful and make for a personalized experience that feels like a five-star hotel. Every room is unique, but all have a sleek and serene atmosphere, with a pillow menu (where you choose the firmness of your pillow), double-paned windows (for peace and quiet at night), an in-room safe, and a minibar. The rooms are high-tech too, with a smart TV built into the mirror (something I find pretty neat). The bathrooms are spacious, bright, and new, with tiled showers, complimentary toiletries, plush bathrobes, and slippers. It’s the best place to stay in Mouraria, one of the oldest neighborhoods in Lisbon. Book here!   2. A Casa das Janelas com Vista Translated as a “House of Windows with a View,” the name of this cozy bed and breakfast doesn’t lie: there are stunning views from most windows here. The design is really homey, with personal touches like unique artwork, fresh flowers, and an eclectic mix of vintage furniture. I love that the included breakfast is served at a communal table, making it easy to meet fellow travelers (the breakfast is delicious too, featuring homemade cakes, fresh bread, croissants, and rotating Portuguese specialties). Although this B\u0026B is in lively Bairro Alto, it’s on a quiet street so you can still get a good sleep. The rooms are on the smaller side but have all the necessary basic amenities, like an in-room safe, air conditioning, and a TV (on request). The big windows let in lots of natural light, and some rooms even have little balconies. The en-suite bathrooms are pretty spacious, featuring rainfall showers and really nice complimentary toiletries. This is a great central place to stay if you’re on a budget but want something more private than a hostel. Book here!   3. Bairro Alto Hotel Located in Chiado and housed in an 18th-century building, this five-star property blends Lisbon’s traditional spirit with sophisticated design — think sleek, contemporary lines complemented by traditional azulejos (ceramic tiles) and rich wooden accents. The hotel’s exceptional breakfast buffet includes a selection of local pastries, fresh fruits, and artisanal cheeses, along with a variety of hot dishes like eggs benedict. I think the rooftop bar is one of the coolest hotel bars in town, and there’s a fitness center complete with a sauna on the property as well. The comfortable rooms feature lush bedding, stylish furnishings, and floor-to-ceiling windows that let in ample natural light. Every room has a desk, Nespresso machine, fresh bottled water, a pillow menu, Bluetooth speakers, a safe, minibar, and a flatscreen TV. The spacious bathrooms are equally impressive, elegantly outfitted with tiled floors, marble sinks, and luxurious amenities like large walk-in showers, high-end toiletries, and plush robes. It’s the ideal place to stay if you want to splash out. Book here!   4. Hotel Alegria This three-star boutique hotel is located in a beautifully restored building from 1865. I love that it retains that historic atmosphere, elegantly decorated with antique Portuguese furniture. The location is great too: it’s just a couple of blocks to the west of Avenida da Liberdade, a leafy thoroughfare known for its shopping. The hotel has a little kiosk in the park across the street where I enjoy getting a drink and watching the world go by. While breakfast isn’t included, it’s worth getting as it’s a nice buffet that includes everything from fresh Portuguese pastries to omelets. It’s served in a cute little breakfast room too. The rooms are cozy and classy, with hardwood floors, unique artwork on the walls, antique furniture, and chandeliers. I especially like the Portuguese tile surrounding the large windows and in the spacious bathrooms. In-room amenities include AC, cozy bathrobes and slippers, a Nespresso machine, a flatscreen TV, an in-room safe, and a minibar. I think you get great value here. And even though you’re in a quiet neighborhood, you’re just walking distance to many main sights. Book here!   5. São Vicente Alfama Hotel This four-star hotel is situated in hilly medieval Alfama, what I find to be one of Europe’s most charming neighborhoods. A boutique property, this smart and chic hotel has just 22 rooms, so it feels homelike and intimate. The complimentary breakfast is excellent too, boasting a spread of Portuguese pastries, cold cuts, fresh fruits, omelets, and French toast. The rooms are bright and airy, with lots of light from the windowed doors leading out to the tiny balconies. I also really appreciate that all rooms have a writing desk (so I can get work done in my room before going out to explore). The rooms are high-tech too, with keyless electronic doors, USB ports, wireless phone chargers, smart TVs, and Bluetooth-integrated sound systems. The bathrooms are luxurious too, with walk-in showers, high-quality toiletries, premium cotton towels, and comfy bathrobes and slippers. This is the best place to stay in Alfama in my opinion. Book here!   6. Corpo Santo Hotel This sleek five-star hotel is set in a Pombaline-era building (a Portuguese architectural style of the 18th century) in the microneighborhood Cais do Sodré. There are a lot of amenities here, including a spa with a steam room, sauna, and jacuzzi, plus, the breakfast here is nothing short of exceptional. You’ll find a spread of fresh pastries, eggs cooked to order, local cheeses, and an array of fruits. They also offer a lot of nice complimentary perks, like wine tastings in the lobby each day, two walking tours per day, snacks you can grab on every floor, and free ice cream in the lobby. You can even get a free 20-minute massage at the spa! Each room is different from the next, but all have a bright and minimal design with a ton of amenities. Think plush beds, 4K TVs, a Nespresso machine, electric kettle, a complimentary minibar, digital safe, bathrobe, and slippers. There’s AC and soundproof windows for a comfortable stay too. The bathrooms are spacious and modern, featuring rainfall showers, high-end toiletries, heated floors, and chromotherapy lighting (which can be adjusted to different colors to evoke different moods). If you want to stay somewhere where you’ll want for nothing, stay here. Book here!   *** I fell in love with Lisbon on my very first visit, and I suspect you might too. The colorful city is filled with great food, soulful music and dance, fantastic weather, and remains one of the more affordable European capitals. Just be sure to choose from one of the hotels above and you’ll have a great stay in Portugal’s vibrant capital!   Get Your In-Depth Budget Guide to Europe!My detailed 200+ page guidebook is made for budget travelers like you!

Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the biggest inventory and best deals. Here’s a complete list of my favorite hostels in Lisbon. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are: SafetyWing (best for nomads) Insure My Trip (for those over 70) Medjet (for additional evacuation coverage) Looking for the Best Companies to Save Money With?
