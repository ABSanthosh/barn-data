  "description": "Several earthen mounds are some of the last remains of Gordion, the ancient capital of Phrygia. At nearly 175 feet tall, the largest of the hills, the \"Midas Mound,\" was named for Gordion's most famous ruler, who was excavated by a team of archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1950s. A large burial chamber made from juniper, cedar, and pine beams was found inside, sheltering the remains of a man, along with precious artifacts of wood and bronze. The tomb is dated to the mid 8th century BC, and allegedly belonged to his father, Gordias. Today, the tumulus mound sits across the road from the small Gordion Museum. A somewhat cramped and long tunnel cuts through the middle of the mound, leading to the ancient wooden beams of the chamber. Astonishingly well-preserved under rubble and dirt, these remains claim the title of world's oldest standing wooden structure.",
