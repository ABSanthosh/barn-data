  "description": "The cranes of Gdańsk have always been a symbol of the city’s place as Poland's de facto port. After Poland's deindustrialization in 1992, the port was shut down and many cranes were no longer used. Now one of Gdańsk's iconic cranes, Crane M3, is charting a new path forward. After almost a year of work, M3 was transformed into a 360-degree scenic lookout point that opened in April 2019.  Located in Gdansk’s rejuvenated Imperial Shipyard district, visitors can climb the crane's stairs to get a breathtaking view of the industrial-turned-commercial zone from almost 100 feet up (around 30 meters high). Despite extensive renovation work, Crane M3 has retained its original industrial look, giving visitors a taste of what life was like in this Polish shipyard.",
