Right, from left: the Pas cup — which can be turned over and used as a candle holder — and Endavant bowl.Credit...Daniela Jacobs/ARC objects.Daniela Jacobs, the founder and designer of Arc, a line of minimalist jewelry and home goods, is perhaps best known for her porcelain creations in shades of ecru and eggshell. But in 2018, a translucent organza garment that Jacobs created for a photo shoot led to such an unexpected swell of purchase inquiries that she decided to create a handful of one-of-a-kind garments to sell, titling it her Invisibles collection. Now, after 10 years in business, Jacobs is releasing a new batch of designs that explore the concept of invisibility with Arc Glass, a limited-edition capsule of rings, bangles, candle holders and plates made of borosilicate glass. In addition to pieces that are completely see-through, a handful of the designs are rendered in black, as well as a smoky hue that changes in different lights. “It almost has a turquoise tint to it, which feels right to me because of the Mediterranean vibe,” says Jacobs, who splits her time between New York and Majorca. As with her porcelain pieces, Jacobs’s glass creations require a bit of mindfulness when worn, but she insists that they’re made for everyday use. “I wear them on the subway. I wear them biking. I wear them when I’m in Spain. When I go to the sea, I take them off and put them on a rock; I come back, they’re fine,” she says.

Right: the hotel overlooks the city’s Main Beach.Credit...Chris MottaliniThe new Casa Loma Beach Hotel is perched on a rocky cliff overlooking Main Beach, the most popular stretch of sand in Laguna Beach, Calif. Previously known as the Inn at Laguna Beach, the 1989 building was renovated over nine months by Marc \u0026 Rose Hospitality, which owns properties in Arizona and California, including La Playa Hotel in Carmel and The Scott in Scottsdale. Now, Casa Loma’s 70 rooms are outfitted with curved sofas and hand-painted tapestries by the California-born artist Joe Swec. A Tivoli Model One Radio plays Casa Loma’s custom channel, which can be relied upon for laid-back music by artists like the French Belgian Balearic-pop group Antena and the Los Angeles-based R\u0026B band Brainstory. Over half the rooms have balconies or patios overlooking the ocean; others open onto the outdoor pool. The lobby bar and lounge, which extends onto a terrace, serves cocktails along with tapas-style snacks such as tinned fish with chips and a smoked salmon breakfast board with eggs, whipped feta and bagels. In the evening, guests get free gluten-free cookies by the local bakery Rye Goods.

Photo: © Juan Daniel CaroThe Colombian artist Olga de Amaral creates sculptures out of thread that, as the curator Glenn Adamson once wrote, “feel not so much made as summoned into being.” This month, the Fondation Cartier Pour l’Art Contemporain in Paris is presenting Europe’s first major retrospective of the 92-year-old titan of textile art. The show brings together 90 works made from the 1960s to the present, many of which have never been shown outside Colombia. They range from heavy wool weavings to fragments of fabric meant to recall leaves on a forest floor to diaphanous installations suspended from the ceiling like ombré mists. Many leaders of the fiber art movement — a cohort of artists, primarily women, who brought thread off the loom and into three dimensions in the 1960s and ’70s — were inspired by pre-Columbian textiles. But de Amaral was the only one of international renown at the time who was originally from Latin America. The Paris exhibition’s design, by the French Lebanese architect Lina Ghotmeh, echoes the spiral shape common in pre-Columbian art as well as de Amaral’s own work. “Olga de Amaral” will be on view from Oct. 12 through Mar. 16 at the Fondation Cartier Pour l’Art Contemporain, fondationcartier.com.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
