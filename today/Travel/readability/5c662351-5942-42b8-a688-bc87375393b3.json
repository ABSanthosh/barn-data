Days earlier, my long-term relationship had collapsed. As my head spun, I wondered how I was going to weather four days of forced small talk, away from home, in another language, with a stranger.Or was this exactly what I needed?Brigitte Miramont, the host of my program, suggested over the phone that we meet at the Starbucks near the Marseille train station’s “dépose minute.” I had no clue what that was, but at our agreed upon time and day, I found the Starbucks and met a beaming Ms. Miramont. She pointed out the “dépose minute,” explaining it meant “drop-off point.”That explanation was the last exchange we had in English.There are no official statistics on how many language homestay programs exist, but many have popped up in recent years as alternatives to formal language schools, not just in France, but also in Britain, Spain, Italy and elsewhere. There are companies, like Lingoo, that connect students with preapproved home stay programs, while other hosts, like Ms. Miramont, operate independently.Ms. Miramont started hosting students at her home seven years ago when she retired from her position as a teacher of French for foreign speakers at Aix-Marseille University. She has had more than 100 students, and most sign up for a one-week course and stay at her countryside house, which has an infinity pool and panoramic views of the Mediterranean.I chose her program, Live and Learn en Provence, which I found on Google, because it had good reviews and offered both rigorous study and cultural immersion. She shows students her favorite spots in the region, planning excursions tailored to their interests. For me, that was swimming, hiking and trying local food.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
