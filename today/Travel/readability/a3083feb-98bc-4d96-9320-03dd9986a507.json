  "description": "When fall arrives in South Korea, it brings with it not just fiery reds and russets on tree leaves, but also carpets of an unusual pink grass known as muhly. The delicate flowers of this hardy plant bloom in fluffy clumps when the weather begins cool, giving the grass its famed pink (and occasionally, purple) hue.  Pink muhly grass (botanical name Muhlenbergia capillaris) is not native to this region, but was brought in from the United States, where, interestingly enough, it has been declared an endangered species. It is now carefully cultivated across South Korea from public parks to private farmlands. Photoshoots amidst pink muhly grass are particularly popular among locals, who have been making a beeline for these fields ever since it was first grown in Jeju Island a decade ago. So much so, that in recent times, pink muhly grass has become the mainstay of South Korea’s popular autumn festivals.  As is the case with cherry blossoms, pink muhly grass pops up first down south, in and around Jeju Island. As the fall goes on, blooms make their way up north towards Seoul. One of the best places for those seeking Insta-worthy images of this fine grass is in Gyeongju, near the Cheomseongdae astronomical observatory within the royal tombs complex. Seeing this ancient 7th-century stone monument set against a blanket of soft pink is a surreal experience.",
