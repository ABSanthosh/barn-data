  "description": "In 1998 Boris Salinas, a local artist in the city of Loja, began to slowly improve his house with mosaics, paintings, and sculptures. Over the years, he was joined by his brother and several other artists, and in 2014 they opened their house to the public as a museum and gallery. Many of the house fixtures and decorations are made with reused materials, such as glass bottles, broken dishes, an old bathtub, and even a cactus. The garden is home to a variety of plants and cacti, including orchids and a thorny tree, as well as a painted ceramic skull that doubles as a mausoleum. There is a workshop next to the house where it’s possible to see recycled materials in bottles ready for use, and a gallery full of sculptures and paintings by the resident artists.",
