  "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ayo-rock-formations",
  "description": "As a large outcropping of diorite hidden in the middle of the island, the Ayo Rock Formations are a unique geological feature on this arid island. Known for its indigenous petroglyphs reportedly left by the Arawak Indians more than 1,000 years ago, the boulders themselves also deserve a visit. The government of Aruba has created paths and added stairs as necessary to offer a contemplative experience. The paths are often narrow and in some cases individuals must almost crawl through small openings, but the walk is distinctive and often captures visitors’s imaginations. Local flora also lines the paths and visitors can see a variety of cacti and bushes that protect themselves with long thorns.",
