  "description": "Olavinlinna, or St. Olaf’s Castle, is a 15th-century fortress in southeastern Finland. It stands on an island in a strait that connects two major lakes. Built by Swedes in 1475 close to the contemporary border with Russia, the castle played a strategic role. Initially a small fortress with three thickset round towers (the first of its kind in Sweden) and a keep, the structure grew in importance as centuries passed. The castle withstood several sieges and was never taken by force, though it changed hands according to terms of surrender. It fell into Russian hands for the first time in 1714 and then again in 1743. The Russians expanded the castle in the 18th century but once the whole of Finland was occupied by Russia in 1809, the fortress lost its significance as it was no longer situated on the border.  Olavinlinna gradually fell into disrepair and much of the castle’s interior was devastated by fire in the 19th century. The newly-born Finnish nation realized the castle’s importance and conducted several major restoration projects. Since 1912, the fortress has been home to the Savonlinna Opera Festival. At first, the festival was held sporadically, but since the 1970s, after the last major restoration, it has been organized annually and attracts visitors from all over the world.",
