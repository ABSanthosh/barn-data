    "description": "Five hours by ferry from Split – and a world away from the clubs of Hvar – the islands’ wooded hills, pine-shaded beaches and transparent waters are buzzing with natureThe sound of a baby crying echoes eerily in the night sky, seemingly coming from the uninhabited Zaklopatica islet that faces the terrace of our holiday rental in Lastovo. “Do you think that’s a bird?” I ask my husband. “At this time of night? Doubt it,” he says.Fast forward a couple of days and we’re in a park ranger’s motorboat bumping around the far-flung Lastovo archipelago in the Adriatic. All its 46 islands (including the main Lastovo island), islets and reefs were declared a nature park in 2006. By luck, I’m with the ornithologist whose discovery of the nesting sites of some of the Mediterranean’s most endangered birds – yelkouan and Scopoli’s shearwaters – was instrumental in Lastovo getting the official protection it deserves.

    "description": "The walk across the North York Moors – which has to be completed in 24 hours – is a mix of trudging and wild beauty. I experienced both as I joined one of the first people to do it in 1955 One August evening in 1955, members of York Mountaineering Club had convened in the city’s Olde Starre Inne. They were, perhaps, lamenting the shortage of mountains (or indeed hills) in York, when club chair David Laughton turned up waving a copy of that month’s Dalesman magazine.It contained a challenge, issued by Bill Cowley, author of the Farmer’s Diary column. Cowley would provide a cup – “an inexpensive one” – to anyone who traversed the North York Moors in less than 24 hours: “… You would cross Carlton Moor, Cringle Moor and Cold Moor; Botton Head and Bloworth; the long flat expanse of Stony Ridge … over Howl Moor and Simon Howe, by Tom Cross Rigg and Snod Hill to Lilla Cross, then over Fylingdales Moor … to the sea.” Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/al-jazirah-al-hamra-heritage-village",
    "description": "Al Jazira Al Hamra was initially established as a fishing and pearl diving town in the 1830s. At the time, it housed approximately 200 people who mainly worked in pearl diving. The town was ruled by the Al Zaab tribe and kept about 25 fishing boats on the tidal island. By the turn of the 20th century, business was booming and Al Jazira Al Hamra was home to more than 2000 inhabitants. After oil was discovered in the United Arab Emirates, many villagers moved to larger cities such as Abu Dhabi, and the villages were abandoned. Al Jazira Al Hamra was abandoned in 1968. Some believe that it was the big-city appeal that pushed people out of Al Jazirat Al Hamra, while other sources cite that conflicts between the villagers and ruler of Ras Al Khaimah led to the abandonment. It is also rumored that ghost sightings led the villagers to leave.  Today, the coral-stone buildings, mosques, and roads are still standing. According to locals, the town is still haunted by the ghosts of its past.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/complejo-cultural-fabrica-imbabura",
    "description": "In 1910, a pair of brothers from Gerona, Spain arrived in Ecuador with a dream of creating a textile empire. They got their start in Ambato, but expanded their business to Atuntaqui in 1924. With the help of hardworking locals, their business grew. The people of the Atuntaqui region, and specifically the Otavalo Valley, were skilled in textiles before the arrival of the Spanish. In pre-Columbian times, the area was known for fine spun and woven works. The precolonial textiles were popular with the conquistadors, who then capitalized the skills of local craftsmen and women. Atuntaqui's location on the railroad and between the provincial capital of Ibarra, and the well-known towns of Otavalo, Cotacachi, and Cayambe, made it the perfect spot for importing machinery and workers, and exporting the completed textiles. In the 1930s, the factory became the birthplace of one of Ecuador's first labor unions. From 1924 to 1997, the factory was considered the most important textile center in northern Ecuador. In 2014, the factory was remodeled into a cultural center. It now includes a large museum showcasing the machinery, as well as exhibits about workers rights throughout Ecuador.",
