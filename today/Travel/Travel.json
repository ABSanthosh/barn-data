    "description": "Breckland is a little-known part of England that sings with peace and rare wildlife. It would undoubtedly be a national park if so much of it hadn’t been commandeered by the military. But there is a place to stay on its bordersThe small white signs with red lettering are dotted through the landscape: “Military training area – keep out”. It adds to the eerie feel of unusually quiet roads and twisted Scots pines, which gather the long summer dusk around them.But when we arrive at our accommodation on an old farm bordering a forbidden area where the British army conduct secretive manoeuvres, the whole place sings with peace. A red kite cavorts in the breeze over handsome parkland, a cuckoo calls and, down by the Wissey, a gin-clear chalk stream, reed warblers chunter from deep within the rushes. Continue reading...",

    "description": "In 1998 Boris Salinas, a local artist in the city of Loja, began to slowly improve his house with mosaics, paintings, and sculptures. Over the years, he was joined by his brother and several other artists, and in 2014 they opened their house to the public as a museum and gallery. Many of the house fixtures and decorations are made with reused materials, such as glass bottles, broken dishes, an old bathtub, and even a cactus. The garden is home to a variety of plants and cacti, including orchids and a thorny tree, as well as a painted ceramic skull that doubles as a mausoleum. There is a workshop next to the house where it’s possible to see recycled materials in bottles ready for use, and a gallery full of sculptures and paintings by the resident artists.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/honningsvag-bamse-statue",
    "description": "Bamse was more than a mascot onboard the Norwegian minesweeper Thorodd during World War II. As a registered crew member, this dog served alongside his fellow sailors and was known for his bravery in battle. He would stand guard in the front gun tower and not move until hostilities were over, never cowering below deck. This inspired the crew so much they had a special tin helmet made for him to wear. In 2006, a bronze statue of Bamse was erected in the Scottish town of Montrose, where he was stationed throughout the war. The Royal Norwegian Navy Museum (Marinemuseet) at Horten later planned to install a smaller bronze version in Honningsvåg, Bame’s hometown. Media attention had renewed interest in Bamse in Norway, sparking a successful fundraiser to install a duplicate of the Montrose statue. In 2009, schoolchildren from both Honningsvåg and from Montrose unveiled the statue at the Honningsvåg harbour Bamse was such a beloved crew member and companion onboard the Thorodd that he now has two statues. The Montrose statue faces northeast toward Honningsvåg, and the Honningsvåg statue faces southwest toward Montrose and Scotland.",
