    "description": "From family-run fairgrounds to a spectacular circus, traditional seaside fun is alive and kicking in the Norfolk coastal town where I grew up‘Circus is an art form of the people. I fundamentally believe that.” I’m in Great Yarmouth for a long weekend, standing in the ring at the Hippodrome circus, bristling from that particular crackle of energy you get from an empty stage. Ringmaster Jack Jay, the fourth generation in a family of impresarios, is fresh from his annual scouting trip in search of international acts to tread the boards in Norfolk: “We have artists whose CV reads ‘Macau, Las Vegas, Great Yarmouth’,” he tells me. “That’s the standard we aim to bring in.”The Hippodrome is a national treasure, one of only two purpose-built circuses left in the country (the other is part of Blackpool Tower, which Jack’s father also managed, briefly, in the 1980s). Founded in 1903 by equestrian George Gilbert, who ran off to join the circus aged 11, it’s an ornate building with art nouveau flourishes. But the real extravaganza is the sinking floor, restored by the Jays in 1979. Using original mechanisms, the ring is transformed into a pool with fountains and synchronised swimmers for the spectacular finale. I’ve seen the show countless times and it never loses its magic.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/podcast-biblioburro",
    "description": "Listen and subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps. Manolo Morales: If you want to know what living in the countryside is like, just ask Luis Soriano. He lives in a small rural town in Colombia called La Gloria. Luis Soriano (translated by Manolo): La Gloria taught me things a city kid would never know. I learned the different kinds of birds, I learned how to identify bird’s nests, how to recognize their sounds, how a mountain sounds at night, how the crickets sing at night, when it’s bee season, or when it’s time for the iguanas to lay their eggs. Manolo: La Gloria sounds like one of these places Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez would write in his books. Many of the people who live in La Gloria are hard-working campesinos. Most are dedicated farmers who work in the fields growing fruits and vegetables. Luis grew up planting in these fields, but he’s taken on a different path. He’s an educator, and he also runs a bookmobile. Except this one’s a little different. He’s not driving a car or a bus. Instead, he’s riding a donkey. And instead of calling his operation a bookmobile, he calls it Biblioburro. I’m Manolo Morales, and this is Atlas Obscura, a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Today we’re heading to La Gloria to learn how Luis Soriano has spent over 20 years running his Biblioburro with his two donkeys, and how it all nearly came to an end after an accident. This is an edited transcript of the Atlas Obscura Podcast: a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Find the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps. Manolo: There’s a story that Luis likes to tell everyone. It’s about the day he was born. Luis’s mother was having a difficult time giving birth to him. The nearest hospital in their town was miles away, so she relied on the help of midwives to give birth. After three days of labor, Luis was born premature. People in town thought he wouldn’t survive. Except for a family friend. She predicted otherwise. Luis (translated by Manolo): And she said, “He is going to be a doctor when he grows up.” But instead I became a teacher, because becoming a doctor is expensive. But I still think I’ve saved many lives by reading to people. Manolo: Luis has been an educator for more than 20 years. During his teen years, he was sent off to live with his grandmother in a city hours away from their town. He came back to La Gloria when he finished high school. Then he became a primary school teacher in another town where he taught reading and writing. He loved doing this work. But he often noticed that the students in his class weren’t doing any of their homework and they were making very little progress with their reading. At first, Luis blamed himself. Maybe he was just a bad teacher. But then he also noticed something else. His students had no access to books. Many of them lived in isolated farmsteads, miles away from their school. For some of these kids, this would be a 40-minute walk. He thought of what he could do to help them out. And the answer was just in front of him. Luis (translated by Manolo): I had 70 books with me. Dictionaries, geographies and history books. I then decided to take these books to my students to help them do their homework. But I soon realized they were too heavy to carry. So I put them on the backs of donkeys. Manolo: People in town were asking him what he was doing with so many books riding a donkey. He simply put it this way. Luis (translated by Manolo): It’s a library mounted on a donkey. So, Biblioburro was born. Manolo: So how does Biblioburro exactly work? Well, Luis actually began this work back in 1997. Most of it was word of mouth. Luis coordinates his visits in other towns with the teachers in that area. He takes two saddles and stacks them with books and mounts one saddle on each of his two donkeys, Alfa and Beto. Together, their names spell “alphabet” in Spanish. Alfabeto. See what he did there? Pretty clever, if you ask me. Basically, he runs Biblioburro like an after-school program. Luis (translated by Manolo): Biblioburro travels to people’s homes who have very limited resources, who don’t benefit from what a populated city has to offer. We take Alfa and Beto to help kids and adults to read, listen, and fulfill their school commitments. Manolo: When Luis reaches the towns he’s visiting, he finds a space with plenty of shade and unfolds a table where he unpacks all of his books. Children can pick up a book to read or have Luis help them out with their homework. At this point, Luis has basically memorized every story he has read to the children. He doesn’t have a favorite book because he says it’s like picking your favorite child. But he does often find himself reading the stories of Tito y Pepita, a children’s book series about two hamsters who dislike one another, but in the end, learn a very valuable lesson. Luis (translated by Manolo): The power of reading is to know what’s written, to open your imagination and transport you to other places without leaving home, to create and feed the mind with magical realism. Manolo: I selfishly asked Luis to read to me one of my favorite books, 100 Years of Solitude (Cien Años de Soledad), a book that heavily features the magical realism Luis mentions. He read the first page, and as he read, every word mattered. It was easy to see how his words could be captivating to the kids in La Gloria. Summers in La Gloria can be intense, and when the sun is hitting strong, it can be difficult for Luis to make his travels. And sometimes there are threats of heavy rain that can also stop him from doing his work. Luis is close to hitting his 30th anniversary with Biblioburro, and he’s not thinking of retiring anytime soon. But a few years ago, he was close to quitting. In 2010, Luis had a bad accident with Alpha and Beto. He fell off one of them and was stomped on his right leg. The injury was so bad that he caught an infection. Unfortunately, doctors couldn’t save his leg, and they had to amputate it. Luis (translated by Manolo): I thought I wouldn’t be the same again. I thought that this was the end and I wouldn’t be able to continue with Biblioburro. But when people came to visit me and saw me in a wheelchair, I couldn’t see them sad. Manolo: Luis did not stop Biblioburro because of the accident. He got a prosthetic leg. It took him some time to adjust. He says it was super heavy, but once he got used to it, he felt like he was walking faster than before. And while Luis is helping out his own community, he’s also making an impact in other parts of the world. Two educators from Dalton, Georgia started a book distribution program after learning what Luis was doing in Colombia. In fact, two teachers from that area, Alice Ensley and Sanjuana Rodriguez, were able to help him out with medical care in 2017, and they continue to help him through a non-profit called Books for Change USA. And his impact does not stop there. He’s also influenced children’s authors to write about him. There’s one book called Waiting for Biblioburro by Monica Brown, and another titled Biblioburro: A True Story from Colombia by Jeanette Winter. Luis did not become a doctor. But today, with the help of his two donkeys, he’s teaching the next generation of leaders to read and possibly save lives. Luis (translated by Manolo): I’ve guided young people who are currently practicing medicine. I’ve guided doctors, bankers, taxi drivers, housewives. Many of them have come to thank me for the time and patience I’ve had with them. And to be reminded of that just fills my soul. And that’s the greatest reward. Manolo: So if you ever find yourself in a tiny town of La Gloria in Colombia, look for one man with two donkeys and a saddle full of books, and tell him hello from me.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/podcast-price-tower",
    "description": "Listen and subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps. Baudelaire Ceus: John Waters is a trained architect. He loves buildings and thinking about them and how they serve society. And he got the bug early. John Waters: My dad got a book called Architecture in Michigan when I was five years old. And I became obsessed with this book. I blame it on my becoming an architect. Baudelaire: The book featured a highlight reel of architecture throughout the United States, buildings designed by some of the greatest architects in American history. Folks like Louis Sullivan, Frederick Law Olmsted, and especially Frank Lloyd Wright. John’s fascination for the work on Wright in particular grew so much that years later, when he was on a cross-country trip, he made it a point to make a pit stop to see one of Wright’s most unique buildings. John: In 1994, I was moving from Los Angeles to Chicago and all my worldly possessions in a U-Haul van. And one of the things I needed to do as I crossed the country was stop in Bartlesville and see Price Tower. Baudelaire: Bartlesville is a city of 40,000 in Oklahoma. And to be honest, his friend, who didn’t really care about architecture, wasn’t really too thrilled. But John was insistent. They needed to see the tower. John: This was, you know, pre-Google Maps, pre-anything. We’re driving to Bartlesville and I was just like, look for a building that looks like it’s out of The Jetsons. Baudelaire: The Price Tower is a 19-story building with floors that extend outward from a central core. The exterior is covered in copper and gold tinted glass, giving it that futuristic look. It wasn’t hard to spot the building once the friends got into town. Aside from its exterior being unique, it dwarfed all the other buildings around it. John was in awe. John: We were standing out front taking pictures and a woman pulls up, and she’s lovely. And she talks about growing up in Bartlesville, taking your kids to the tower, taking people through. So there’s a real local pride about the building. We talked for 15, 20 minutes. So that was my first experience with Price Tower. Baudelaire: But that wouldn’t be his last experience. Thirty years later, the fate of Price Tower would be up in the air, and John would be right in the middle of the effort to preserve it. My name is Baudelaire and this is Atlas Obscura, a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Today, we go to Bartlesville, Oklahoma to see Frank Lloyd Wright’s only skyscraper: the Price Tower. We hear why this Oklahoma landmark is so unique and why this iconic building is sitting empty today. This is an edited transcript of the Atlas Obscura Podcast: a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Find the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps. Baudelaire: If you know the name of any one architect, chances are it’s Frank Lloyd Wright. John: I think you could say he was the first American star-chitect. He really was someone who was a larger-than-life personality. Baudelaire: Frank Lloyd Wright had a complicated personal life. Multiple marriages, multiple affairs. He got caught up in some scandals. But through all of that, he created some masterpieces. For the most part, he designed single-family homes. His most well-known is probably Falling Water, a three-floor, four-bedroom house built in the midst of thick woods in western Pennsylvania. Let me also add that it’s literally sitting on top of a waterfall. Wright also designed buildings like the Guggenheim in New York. It’s this white concrete structure with a top-heavy spiraling form. That’s seen by many as Wright’s masterpiece, but it’s not alone in its unique design. John: Whether you like them or not, they’re endlessly fascinating. They are complex. Much as he promoted the idea of simplicity, his definition of simplicity was complex. And they span 70-plus years of work. Baudelaire: From the 1880s to the late 1950s, Frank Lloyd Wright designed 1,114 architectural works, of which 532 were built. Now, of that 532, Frank Lloyd Wright only has one skyscraper. This skyscraper was originally supposed to go in Manhattan, a place that would make a lot of sense for a skyscraper. But this was the late 1920s, and the whole thing fell through during the early years of the Great Depression. John: And as architects do, if a project doesn’t go, it doesn’t mean they don’t keep trying to shop it around. Baudelaire: Wright had the idea on ice for about 20 years until a new opportunity for his design came through. The H.C. Price Company was a business that made pipeline equipment for oil companies, and they wanted to build a new headquarters in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, something that would stand out. Joe Price, the owner’s son, happened to also be studying architecture, and he talked the idea over with one of his professors, and that professor suggested they reach out to Frank Lloyd Wright. Now, let’s pause here for a second just so I can emphasize that at this point, Frank Lloyd Wright was THE star-chitect. He had over 400 buildings designed across four continents. He was the Michael Jordan of architecture. Joe Price’s dad, the CEO of the company, pulled up to Wright at his Wisconsin studio in 1952 and asked Wright if he had any ideas. And Wright pulled out that one idea from a couple decades back. The company called the tower Price Tower, but Wright called it The Tree That Escaped the Forest. John: He loved to, you know, be quasi-poetics like that. Baudelaire: The Price Tower looks sort of like a game of Jenga after a few rounds. The central trunk—to keep it with the tree analogy—is actually four elevator shafts that anchor the building’s concrete floors that extend out like branches. It has an oxidated copper color that looks like leaves, and it has gold-tinted windows. It’s an example of something Wright would call organic architecture. John: One of the things about organic architecture is it’s very much built like this, and I’m putting my fingers together, and you know, I’m like, everything is—everything’s tied together. I have a professor who would say about Wright’s building, “nothing does everything, but everything does something.” There isn’t just like, this is the structure, this is the enclosure, this is this component, this is that component. They’re all working together. Baudelaire: Price Tower was open to the public as an event space, people could tour the tower itself, there was a restaurant, apartments, a hotel, all this aside from the office spaces on the highest floors. The Price Company enjoyed their masterpiece of a headquarters for 25 years until they relocated to Dallas in 2001. And then, a new, more tumultuous history for the tower began. John: Price Tower is very different. You cannot do whatever you want to in Price Tower. Baudelaire: Meaning, it’s not like a standard office building where you can really adjust the space to exactly match your needs. You can’t just knock down a wall, because, well, that wall is actually helping hold the structure together. Wright designed the tower and everything in it, from the couches to the lamps, to sort of remain as is. Everything about its design has a purpose. John: So, for instance, these two-story apartments in Price Tower are the stairways, the balcony, they’re all part of the structure of the building, as opposed to a typical high-rise where, as I say, you have a different system. It’s a challenging building to steward. Baudelaire: And that challenge is why the building, this iconic skyscraper designed by one of the most famous architects of all time, is sitting empty today. Price Tower has had three owners since 2001, all eventually facing the issue that the building is hard to turn a profit on while maintaining it exactly as it is. Not only can you not adjust the physical structure, but even the furniture in it must stay. The tower has been closed for seven months and remains in limbo due to a year-long legal dispute over its ownership and future purpose. Adding to the situation, the Price Tower holds significant sentimental value for Bartlesville residents, like the woman John met when he first came in 1994. Many locals hope the tower will reopen and be actively used soon. The Price Tower is a symbol of Bartlesville. It’s on murals and postcards of the city. And this is where John comes in, because he belongs to another group with a stake in the future of the tower. He works for the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy. Basically, they’re a group that makes sure Frank Lloyd Wright’s buildings across the U.S. are preserved and protected. As it relates to the Price Tower, they’re going to work with whoever the next owner is to make sure the tower can be opened while maintaining it as the piece of art that it is. Just recently, John and some of his colleagues made it out to Bartlesville to do a walkthrough of the tower to see how it’s holding up after being closed for months. John: There are no utilities currently on. It’s been a real concern. I will say, we have been very concerned about the building over the course of the winter when we went down. I will say, though, we were all prepared for much worse conditions than we found. Baudelaire: Aside from the basement, which had a couple inches of water, the inside of the tower was in pretty decent shape. It’s still unsettled what will happen next to the tower, though. And John says, though it’s been challenging for its owners over the years, he feels it’s a building worth keeping and maintaining as it is. John: I think there is a way, I mean, and people write, I mean, we are shaped by our architecture, and that can occur in various ways. And, you know, this is a very special building. I mean, we are very mired in the challenges of it right now. But it is completely one of a kind. This building is amazing. It’s a challenge, but it’s a challenge worth meeting. Baudelaire: The Price Tower is closed, so if you go to Bartlesville, you can’t actually go in it. But you can take pictures outside of it and enjoy it like John did back in the day.
