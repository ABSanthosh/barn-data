    "description": "The new direct daytime route, via Strasbourg, sweeps through enchanting landscapes from vineyards to forests. But some say it needs to be quicker still if the train is to be more attractive than flyingUntil last week, my most recent trip from Paris to Berlin on a direct daytime train was way back in early 2015 with RZD Russian Railways. The train had a Polish restaurant car with a quirky menu featuring caviar, kangaroo steak and South African wines. The journey between the two capital cities was scheduled to take 13 hours, and despite dawdling along the way, we arrived in Berlin bang on time. It was a day with breakfast by the Seine, lunch (without caviar) on the train as we crossed the Rhine and nightcaps by the Spree in Berlin.More recently, the only direct service between Paris and Berlin has been a thrice-weekly overnight train. Branded as a Nightjet, there is nothing jet-like about it. It takes even longer than the Russian daytime train did 10 years ago. But as of last week, there is now a faster direct option. Germany’s national rail operator Deutsche Bahn and its French counterpart SNCF have just launched a much faster direct daytime Paris to Berlin train. Continue reading...",

    "description": "\"Pie and mash,\" a classic Cockney staple, originated around the Docks of London in the Victorian era. Often accompanied by jellied eels, the dish typically consists of a minced beef pie and mashed potatoes, along with a parsley liquor. Contrary to what the name might suggest, this herbaceous green sauce contained no booze, but rather liquid used for preparing the eels. While “eel, pie and mash shops” were once common throughout London, the number is in steady decline. Many of the old establishments have permanently in recent decades. Today, the title of the oldest surviving eel and pie shop belongs to M. Manze, a family business founded in 1902. The Manze family immigrated from Italy to Britain in 1878, settling in Bermondsey and establishing themselves as ice merchants. Later, they entered the eel, pie and mash trade, occupying the building of another pie shop that opened in 1892, the year now attributed to M. Manze itself. The Manze family proved quite successful and owned a total of fourteen shops in London by 1930, though none of which (save for the original Tower Bridge Road location) has survived the test of time. Since 2019, M. Manze is run by the fourth generation of the family, carrying on the legacy of a (once) popular Cockney trade.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/reims-gueux-f1-circuit",
    "description": "First used in 1926 to host the second Grand Prix de la Marne, the circuit of Reims-Gueux consisted of a triangular layout of public roads, just east of Reims. Unlike its older, more-famous sibling at Le Mans, the Circuit de la Sarthe, there was no major section of the racetrack closed to regular traffic on non-race days. In the 1950s, the track layout went through both major and minor changes to comply with the increasing speed of race cars and motorcycles. After the last set of  changes in 1954, F1 went on sporadically for another 12 years until 1966, when the F1 French Grand Prix was held in Reims for the last time. Other racing continued for some years, but in 1972 Reims-Gueux closed permanently due to financial troubles. Despite more recent efforts to hold historic racing events, no official racing was seen at Reims-Gueux again. Today, the first two layouts of the track can still be driven on public roads. The later ones had a section of tarmac removed, which resolved in the road ending in the middle of a farmer's field, nearly 1,000 feet short of its intersection with the modern N31 at the Muizon Corner. The Amis of Reims-Gueux (Friends of Reims-Gueux) are a group of local enthusiasts dedicated to preserving the rich motorsport heritage and the already few remnants of the old circuit, saving them from destruction. Through events, restoration projects, and educational initiatives, they aim to keep the spirit of racing alive, celebrating both the thrilling competitions that took place and the community that formed around them. Their efforts ensure that the legacy of Reims-Gueux continues to inspire future generations of motorsport fans.",
