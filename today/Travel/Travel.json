A dolphin-spotting trip had seemed a wonderfully relaxing way to spend a morning out on the shimmering seas around Sagres, the Algarve’s westernmost town, believed for centuries to be the very edge of the world.

The village has medieval Ottoman architecture built on a hillside, with stone houses, narrow streets, and fortress in the top of the hill that gives you an amazing panoramic view from the region. The town was first mentioned on records from the 15th century, but it was likely founded even earlier, in the late 14th century. Počitelj played a significant role in controlling access along the Neretva River and was an important administrative and military center during the Ottoman period. Some importants places of Počitelj are the Počitelj Fortress, Sahat Kula (Clock Tower), Šišman Ibrahim Pasha Mosque, Hammam (Turkish Bath).",

    "description": "Founded in 1337, Ryūkō-ji Temple is located atop a hill overlooking Enoshima Island. The name, also read as Tatsu-no-kuchi, means \"dragon-mouth\" in Japanese, referring to the local legend of a dragon whose body formed the terrain. In the Middle Ages, from the Kamakura period (1185–1333) to the Muromachi period (1336–1573), the site served as major execution grounds. It is particularly famous for the Tatsunokuchi Hōnan incident, in which Buddhist saint Nichiren was nearly beheaded here in 1260 but spared when an orb of light came flying from Enoshima and distracted the executioner. Notable executions done at Tatsunokuchi include those of To Seichu, an ambassador from the Yuan state, as well as the rebel samurai Hōjō Tokiyuki. Historical records also mention numerous executions and \"head identifications\" done in Katase and Koshigoe, possibly referring to the site.",
