    "description": "A medieval Haute-Savoie village makes a great base for a gourmet break, with delicious comfort food and local wines. And the snowshoeing and skiing aren’t bad either, if you can drag yourself away from the tableThe unmistakable whiff of cow – pungent, but not unpleasant – hit me as soon as I arrived at Ferme Dunoyer above the Haute-Savoie village of Samoëns. Rather than put me off, the scent heightened my appetite for the cheese blowout that was to come.Sat at a wooden communal table inside the pine-walled restaurant run by the farm’s owner, Blandine Dunoyer, I waited for the bonanza of mountain comfort food: fondue savoyarde, tartiflette, raclette, then diots (smoked pork sausages) with polenta. Somehow, I found room for potée savoyarde, a rib-sticking dish of slow-cooked pork shoulder, cabbage and potatoes, then a round of top-notch alpine cheese, reblochon and tomme de savoie, before a creamy blueberry dessert.

    "description": "Forty women joined the first ‘Hostel Hoolie’ – an exhilarating programme of hillwalking, climbing, running and socialising in Scotland’s Cairngorms‘Do you run in the dark?” “How do you stop chafing?” “Does menopause affect your flexibility?” “What snacks do you take on the hill?” It’s the first night of the inaugural “Hostel Hoolie” – a women’s outdoor adventure weekend in Braemer in the Cairngorms – and in a living room packed with 40 guests, the conversation is flowing thick and fast.Outside it’s wild and windy; there have been snow-closed roads and rural diversions, but the long journeys are quickly forgotten. Most women have come alone, though you wouldn’t know it. This weekend is a collaboration between two outdoor adventure companies: women’s trail running and hillwalking specialist Girls on Hills, and The Adventure Syndicate, a trio of epic cyclists who put on madcap events on two wheels throughout the year. Both organisations frequently partner with Hostelling Scotland, and we’re staying at the newly reopened Braemar Youth Hostel. Adding to the fun is yoga teacher Lindsay Warrack, and a hired sauna from Stravaig Saunas set up in the woods outside the hostel. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Located in Rotterdam's historic Delfshaven, this quirky museum features more than 100 vintage pinball machines available for visitors to play at any given time. Many of the machines on display here date back to before the Second World War. The playable pinball machines include classics featuring the Addams Family, the Big Lebowski, the Twilight Zone, and many more.  For the curious, there's also a section of the museum devoted to the historical evolution of spijkerbal, as it's known in Dutch. The oldest piece in the collection is a venerable toupie hollandaise table, or toptafel, from 1853. This \"Dutch spinning top\" game, a predecessor of modern-day pinball, became popular throughout aristocratic European circles in the 17th century.",

    "description": "The area near Tapkir Galli (a busy road in the center of the city) is known for its electronics market. In this area, there are also several old temples and mansions. Among these structures is a beautiful stone building that houses the Pune Prarthana Samaj. Pune Prarthana Samaj was founded in December 1870. It has its roots in the Brahmo Samaj movement inspired by the religious and social reformer Raja Ram Mohan Roy. Pune Prarthana Samaj is a society focused on the spiritual upliftment of the self, leading to the spiritual upliftment of society at large. It aims to create a value and knowledge based society through its motto: Humanize, Equalize, Spiritualize. Ever since its establishment, the society has focused on social enlightenment by introducing and encouraging progressive thoughts and practices. The society’s prayer hall is called Hari Mandir. It is a large congregation hall made of grey basalt stone and has a wooden ceiling. The hall has stunning vintage architecture. It was constructed in 1909. It stands on a 1,700-square-meter plot of land donated by Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade, one of the society’s founding members. With the premises, there is a stupa of Dr. Sir Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, another one of the founding members. The building stands in the middle of a crowded market area and offers a window to the city’s history and the efforts taken by the citizens to bring progressive change and social reforms in society.",
