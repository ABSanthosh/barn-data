    "description": "The medieval Lombardy town in the Valtellina Alps will host the skiing in the 2026 Winter Olympics, but for now it’s full of under-the-radar charmViewed from the top of the 2,255-metre-high Stelvio piste, the town of Bormio far below looks like a Christmas cake, with pine trees and church spires poking out of a snow-filled scene. The two are connected by a run which, with a vertical drop of 1,010 metres and gradients reaching 60%, is one of the most technically demanding and physically gruelling descents on the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) Ski World Cup circuit. The men’s downhill and super-G events are held here regularly, including this December.Luckily for someone who has never been, and will never be, a natural-born skier, I’m not here to tackle this beast of a piste. My bird’s-eye view of the town is instead part of an enjoyably energetic snowshoe hike with guide Luca in the Stelvio national park, Italy’s largest at more than 500 square miles (1,300 sq km).

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/renslow-trestle",
    "description": "When the Milwaukee Road (more formally known as the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, \u0026 Pacific Railroad) abandoned its tracks through Washington state in 1980, the state eventually acquired the right-of-way to be used as a basis for a recreational trail. Now called the Palouse to Cascades Trail, the trail construction has occurred in fits and starts, with gaps being filled in as funding allows. One of the biggest gaps was here, where the Renslow Trestle now crosses Interstate 90 between Ellensburg and Vantage. The original timber trestle was built in 1908, then replaced by the present steel trestle in 1910. The steel trestle was built within the wooden trestle, a piece at a time, to minimize disruption of the rail traffic. The trestle crosses the canyon containing Johnson Creek (also called Park Creek), and is some 680 feet long, with a height of roughly 118 feet. The route along the creek was much later followed, in the late 1960s, by Interstate 90. Conveniently, there was plenty of clearance for the freeway to be laid between the existing trestle supports and, of course, the trestle was amply high enough to clear the tallest vehicles. The last passenger train crossed Renslow Trestle in May 1961, and freight trains stopped in March 1980. The rails all along the route were then salvaged. The rest of the right-of-way could then be converted to trail, but the trestle itself sat abandoned, a forlorn steel skeleton between the trail ends on either side. It was too dangerous to cross on foot, so hiking, biking, and horse traffic had to make a long detour between the ends of the trail. As more of the trail was completed, agitation grew for the Renslow Trestle to be retrofitted to be safe for non-motorized traffic, and this finally occurred in the late 2010s. Prefabricated concrete slabs were laid on the trestle bed and guardrails were installed. The trestle opened in spring 2021.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/willow-globe-theatre",
    "description": "Head down an unassuming country lane splintering off the A470 road connecting the Welsh towns of Rhayader and Builth Wells, and you’ll spot something unexpected amidst the bucolic scenery: a theater. And not just any theater—a circular one made out of living branches of willow. The Willow Globe (or Y Glôb Byw in Welsh) is a replica of Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre in London that was built based on the Globe’s original design plans. It is one-third the size of the famed performance space in the capital, and was constructed primarily from living willow trees, making it, as far as the owners are aware, the only willow theater in the world. So how did a theater with Shakespearean connections come to be built in a field in rural Cymru (Wales)? It was the result of a community’s passion for dramatic performance and their knack for cost-cutting. When Susanna Best and Philip Bowen, founders of the charity Shakespeare Link (which uses the works of Shakespeare to bridge gaps of language and cultural difference), moved to Mid Wales, they became aware of a lack of a central hub in the region to showcase works by the great bard to the local community. The cost of building a theater from scratch proved prohibitively expensive, so, with help from local volunteers, they opted to grow one instead. The project began in 2006, and blossomed into the impressive theatre that wows spectators—and surprises unsuspecting Welsh walkers—to this day. The enchanting, intimate venue, often lit by the golden hue of the setting sun, hosts open-air performances from April to September.",
