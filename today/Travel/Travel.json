    "description": "History comes to life on a hike through the woods and wagonways of County Durham, which takes in mining, trains, an award-winning museum – and corned beef and potato pieThe Great Northern Coalfield once provided the raw fuel that powered Britain through the Industrial Revolution. For over two centuries, coal from the mines of Durham and Northumberland was trundled down a maze of wagonways and rail lines to the coast to then be shipped to London.The mines are long gone, but eight miles north of Durham city, relics of the north-east’s industrial heritage can be found hidden amid ancient woodland and a steep-sided gorge.

    "description": "‘No resorts, no tourist traps and no fancy restaurants’ – the friends behind the Kids of the Colony YouTube channel go in search of real connections in their countries of origin‘Kayum was my friend for years,” recalls Abubakar Finiin. “But when I met his grandad in Bangladesh, it just felt like I understood his whole story. I knew so much more about him as a person.” This moment of connection captures the essence of Kids of the Colony, a grassroots travel series on YouTube created by three childhood friends from Islington: Abubakar, Kayum Miah and Zakariya Hajjaj, all 23. In a series of chatty vlogs that thrive on their offbeat humour and close friendship, the trio provide a rich travelogue of culture and identity as they explore the countries of their parents’ birth.The idea came to Abubakar while contemplating his next steps after graduating from Oxford University in 2023. “I just thought about the places that we came from,” he says, reflecting on the layered identity of growing up in London with ties elsewhere. Abubakar is Somali, Kayum is Bengali and Zakariya is of Moroccan and English descent. Continue reading...",

    "title": "Monterrey’s Contemporary Art Museum (MARCO) in Monterrey, Mexico",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/patio-of-sculptures-at-marco",
    "description": "Designed by noted architect Ricardo Legorreta, Monterrey's Contemporary Art Museum—known as MARCO (from Museo de ARte COntemporáneo)—opened its doors in 1991. Legorreta was influenced by the Tapatía School of architecture, probably best exemplified by the works of his teacher, Luis Barragán. The Tapatía architectural school derives its name from the term used to descrive natives of Barragán’s home town, Guadalajara: the capital of Jalisco, known for its large number of country estates, or “haciendas,” many of which produce tequila and similar spirits. Architecturally, haciendas are greatly influenced by the tastes of Spanish colonists, and this influence can be seen in their open-air interior courtyards surrounding separate buildings to house extended families, service staff, animals, and even industrial areas. Many consider haciendas among the most representative architectural styles of Mexico, including in Nuevo León, of which Monterrey is the capital. So when Legorreta was selected to design MARCO, which was to become one of Monterrey’s calling cards in its rapid modernization at the turn of the century, he looked to the past for inspiration. MARCO is centered on a square central section in a nod to the hacienda courtyard. Normally open to the air on an hacienda, the museum’s version is indoors and mirrors the typical central well or fountain with a reflection pool filled at random intervals from a waterfall-like source. The “Patio de las Esculturas” of the Museum is practically its only outdoors area, thanks to two of Monterrey’s best-known characteristics: its often-extreme weather and its impressive natural surroundings that earned it the nickname “Ciudad de las Montañas” (City of Mountains). Chief among these mountains is the Cerro de la Silla, resembling a “silla de montar,” which can be translated as Saddle Hill. The land earmarked for MARCO had a great view of this hill, which Legorreta decided to highlight with an open-air patio. (It has probably helped in the installation of massive sculptural works for temporary exhibitions as well.) This patio can perhaps be seen as the equivalent of the hacienda’s stables, or another structure separate from the main house. In true Tapatía School style, the building employs linear volumes and bold colors, “Mexican pink” chief among them. The high walls enclosing most of the patio give way to a much lower one in the direction of Saddle Hill to allow its imposing presence to lord over the view. Other than the shade of these walls, the only cover comes from a walkway lined with featureless geometric columns, a minimalist response to a colonnade. Unlike hacienda patios, this space is completely devoid of vegetation, in order to keep the sky and view as the only natural intrusions in a man-made environment designed to showcase sculptural works.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wonderwerk-cave",
    "description": "Over a million years ago, one of our ancient ancestors took a burning stick from a wildfire and carried it into a dark cave in South Africa. Light danced on the walls as our hominin forebear (Homo Erectus, that is, not quite modern humans just yet) placed the burning stick on a pile of twigs, which burst into flames. Or at least, this is the scene we might imagine based on evidence found in Wonderwerk Cave.  Controlled fire—aka a campfire—was one of the most important breakthroughs in our soon-to-be-human history. Mastering fire allowed our great-great-great- (add about 40,000 more greats) grandparents to stay warm, light up the night, and keep predators at bay. Most importantly, it meant they could roast their food. Cooking made food easier to chew and digest, unlocking significantly more calories and nutrients than raw food. The innovation of fire and its impact on early diets is also believed to have played a major role in increasing brain size among our early human ancestors over the next half-million years. Wonderwerk Cave traces this early culinary history. Inside the 456-foot-long (139-meter) cavity, signs of ancient fires suggest people cooked food here about a million years ago. Buried deep in the rock, archeologists and scientists found the ashy, burnt remains of grasses, leaves, and animal bones. This discovery ranks as some of the earliest evidence of controlled fire.  While this is the oldest currently accepted evidence for hominid controlled fire, it is certainly possible that hominid controlled fire may date back as far as 2 million years ago.",
