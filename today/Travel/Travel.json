    "description": "A couple have combined their passion for sustainability with chic hospitality set a stone’s throw from West Cork’s art scene The drive south through County Cork grew prettier with every turn. From Gougane Barra, where a tiny chapel sits at the lake’s edge, the road winds through old rebel country, into deep forests where foxgloves bloom along the mountainside. Bantry House – a magnificent estate overlooking a lovely bay – marked our path toward Ballydehob, West Cork’s boho village just north of the Mizen Head peninsula.It’s a suitably impressive setting for Native, a new off-grid eco-guesthouse just a stone’s throw from the village. The brainchild of Didi Ronan (who previously worked in public policy and the music industry) and husband Simon (who runs the sustainable landscape architect studio SRLA), the aim was to create somewhere that has a positive impact on both the environment and local community.

    "description": "The resort was ahead of its time – built to handle industrial numbers of tourists while not displacing residents. And beyond the full English breakfasts and pub crawls, there’s an authentic Spanish side to itLast year, Benidorm welcomed close to 3 million visitors. Despite its reputation as a British holiday mecca – nearly 900,000 UK travellers visited the city in 2024 – it was actually Spanish nationals who made up the largest share, with more than one million domestic visitors flocking to the Costa Blanca resort, according to Benidorm city council. I have a feeling that these visitors did not come for the stereotype of full English breakfasts and pub crawls, but for something often overlooked by international tourists: the authentic, everyday rhythm of Spanish coastal life.In a country where tourism makes up about 15% of GDP but has also spurred a housing shortage and countermovements, Benidorm offers a contrast to cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where tourism pressures are acute. The city’s mid-20th-century reinvention as a purpose-built resort might once have been controversial, but today it looks surprisingly sustainable in the context of a national housing emergency.

    "description": "Listen and subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps. Dylan Thuras: Hidden beneath the streets of Minneapolis lies a strange geologic anomaly. It’s called Schieks Cave. Above the cave, the city is alive, full of vitality and character. The glow from buildings casts shadows over the streets. The skyline blends old-world charm with modern design. Traffic hums, buildings tower, but deep below all of that, there’s a secret buried down there. Access to it lies deep below the street. What appears as a simple manhole cover leads to an entirely different world down below. Greg Brick: It’s a perfect maze underlying a full city block. Dylan: Greg Brick, an urban explorer and longtime Minneapolis resident, as was I once, had known about the cave for years. Greg: It was just the sense of remoteness. You got this cave 75 feet below street level, with a well-known history dating back to 1904, and nobody that I was aware of had been there. Dylan: The manhole cover was a gateway inside. However, as much as the city wanted to keep it secret, Greg Brick knew it was there and was desperate to get inside. I’m Dylan Thuras, and this is Atlas Obscura, a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Greg’s first attempt, it led to a dead end. Back in 2000, back, in fact, when I was a senior in high school in Minneapolis, Greg was also there finding his way inside this cave. And when he got in there, he made a shocking discovery. This is an edited transcript of the Atlas Obscura Podcast: a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Find the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps. Dylan: Greg Brick was obsessed. For years, he had sifted through old newspaper articles, exploring the history of this cave. He turned to old guidebooks, trying to find something, anything, about the history of this cave. Greg: They published a long historical section about the cave with historic photographs from the time it was discovered in 1904, its maps, and so it was a known entity. Dylan: The cave was originally discovered by a Minneapolis sewer engineer in 1904, but the city decided that they should keep the cave a secret. They did not want people thinking that the city was built on empty, unstable ground. And in 1929, the city reinforced the area with walls and piers and artificial drainage systems. That certainly didn’t make it any easier to get into this cave. So Greg had to think creatively. Greg: When I wanted to go in the cave, I couldn’t go in the city and ask them, I had to find my own way in. Dylan: It was not an easy project, and he had several failed attempts. Greg: I got pretty close in the ’90s. Dylan: But in 2000, Greg and his buddy made a major breakthrough. Greg: We were down there walking around in the storm drains, then we noticed that the floor of a sanitary sewer had collapsed. And that if you went through that break, then you had access to Schieks Cave after a little while. Dylan: And crawling through the gap, suddenly, he was in. As Greg moved deeper into the cave, he was hit with a unique smell, a smell of sandstone and water and earth. It didn’t smell bad, it just smelled like being deep underground. He reached for his flashlight, and when he turned it on, he was suddenly struck speechless. The walls were lined with decades of natural carvings, just little grooves and marks that had been made by the constant flow of water over time. But there was more down there. There were roaches scurrying all around. There was a pasta plate full of earthworms wriggling around across the cave floor. Weirdly, there were plastic straws scattered around the space too. It wasn’t necessarily a space you would call charming. But for an urban explorer like Greg, this was his bread and butter. Greg: Some of the things that turn people off about Schieks cave is actually what made it fascinating to me. Dylan: But among all the other sights, there was something down there that Greg was not expecting, and in fact, definitely did not want to find: raw sewage. The smell was no longer quite so nice. Greg: It formed a substantial lake about 100 feet across that we called the Black Sea. It was about this knee-deep black fluid that was actually raw sewage that was going in there to bubble and ferment. Dylan: Greg was not just your average urban explorer. He is a hydrogeologist as well, which means that he studies how groundwater moves through the soil and the rock. So instead of being just completely grossed out and running away, Greg decided to explore a little more deeply. And among the muck and the gunk, he spotted something else surprising, a little subterranean waterfall. Greg: What it actually was was what a hydrologist or hydrogeologist would call a ceiling spring. So this is groundwater pouring out of a crevice in the ceiling. And so it was about six feet high. Dylan: And in good hydrogeologist form, Greg decided he needed to know a little more. He simply could not resist measuring the water temperature. Greg: And I found out that it was elevated 20 degrees above the expected groundwater temperature for Minneapolis. Dylan: This was a problem. The water was way, way too hot. Greg: The groundwater in Minneapolis is actually at the temperature of Jackson, Mississippi. Dylan: Something was warming the water below Minneapolis, making it as warm as the water you would find in the sweltering South. But this was way up in the cold Midwest. Water like that was not supposed to be happening. Greg: I mean, this is like the most unusual groundwater phenomenon that I’ve come across in the state of Minnesota. And it has public health implications. Dylan: Greg returned to the cave again to retest his findings, and the results were the same. The closer he measured to the surface, the warmer the water got. It turns out back in 2008, a team of researchers from the University of Minnesota had predicted that heat from the urban surface, the streets and buildings themselves, was seeping deep underground, essentially heating the groundwater up in a giant metropolitan microwave. And when Greg journeyed down into the cave and discovered this weirdly warm groundwater, he ended up confirming this team’s suspicions. Greg’s exploration had been sparked out of mere curiosity, but he was starting to think that this whole thing could have consequences. Here is what he thought was going on: In many cities, including my hometown of Minneapolis, the pipes, the infrastructure is all getting pretty old. And so sewage occasionally starts to leak out of them, which means that all of that bacteria starts to get into the ground. And then there is warm groundwater in the surrounding area. And in all of that warm water, the bacteria multiplies, increases quickly. And then you’ve got this warm water full of bacteria, and it can be sucked back into the pipes, back into your house, out of the faucet. So this was not a major crisis or a looming catastrophe, but more like a low, unsettling hum. You know, little increases in gastrointestinal issues, maybe not a life-threatening problem, but not ideal. So Greg reached out to local Minneapolis authorities and energy companies to talk to them about the problem, but the response was not what he hoped for. Greg: When I talk about the warm groundwater, it’s like, oh, okay, yeah, I accept that. But they don’t get it because they’re not experts in that exact field. Dylan: So Minneapolis has this problem. It’s got a cave beneath its streets. The cave is filled with warm water, and that warm water is full of sewage. It may be cold comfort, but Minneapolis is not alone. It’s a problem that other cities around the world have encountered. Across Europe, across Canada, researchers have even explored recycling some of that underground heat, using it as an energy source, like a heat pump using the heat of the underground water to create heat in your homes. Greg: What they’ve done is turned it into a geothermal opportunity. Dylan: But even so, Greg has said it has been pretty hard to get anyone to pay attention. Warming groundwater, maybe not the sexiest issue out there. Greg: I went to a TV news channel who wanted to do the story, but she said, well, you don’t have any visuals, so we can’t. And well, what do I do? I mean, what are you supposed to photograph for warming groundwater? Maybe someone throwing up in a toilet? Does that do it for you? Dylan: In 2008, Minneapolis shut down any access to Schieks Cave. They passed a law making it illegal to enter critical infrastructure, which now includes this cave. It was not Greg’s research particularly that led to the shutdown. These things travel, and once word got out, it became something of a hotspot for urban explorers. To be fair, I probably would have been one of those urban explorers if I had been in town when this was all happening. Greg: As for urban explorationists with many fields and hobbies and so on, you know, the internet has just drastically increased the traffic in these places. Dylan: Today the cave is off limits, hidden behind a manhole, and also politics. It blocks potential explorers. And most of the people who walk on the city’s busy streets, including myself when I go home to visit my parents, we are all oblivious to this world just 75 feet below us. But Greg Brick remains hopeful. He may have started out as a curious explorer, but he believes that his research and passion for exploring this forgotten world underneath the city, one day he hopes will bring attention to both the cave’s rich historical lore and its potential impact on science.

    "description": "Listen and subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps. Andrew Coletti: Imagine that you have just been invited to a dinner party in third century Rome. Dylan Thuras: Yes. Andrew: This is going to be a very fancy kind of affair. It’s going to be some high-profile guests, and you want to make sure that you’re going to make a good impression. Dylan: Okay. Andrew: So, you’re going to need a few things. You can figure out your outfit, of course. Dylan: Toga. I’m assuming Toga. Andrew: Toga, definitely, as long as you’re a Roman citizen. You’ve got to bring your spoon and napkin, because you have to bring those to an ancient Roman dinner party. Dylan: These are expected of you, that you come with your own silverware. Andrew: Yes, because they’ll be eating out of communal dishes in the center of the table. And there’s just one thing that you have to maybe do some extra preparation, which is the conversation. Dylan: This is a high-society affair. These people are well-traveled. They’re well-read. Let’s say, like, I’m kind of outclassed here. Like, I was invited because I’m, like, the cousin of somebody, and they felt like they had to invite me. How do I get ready for this? How can I actually prepare to not look like a doof? Andrew: Well, that’s when you can breathe a sigh of relief and relax, and you can go to your library. Because you’ve just remembered that you own a copy of a work of literature called Deipnosophistae. Dylan: Of course I do. Deipnosophistae. How could I have forgotten? Well, that’s good. I can’t wait to crack open this book and figure out how it’s going to help me survive. I’m Dylan Thuras. Andrew: And I’m Andrew Coletti. Dylan: And this is Atlas Obscura. Today we are going to be talking about Deipnosophistae and how this book is really the answer to all of my ancient Roman dinner party social problems. This is an edited transcript of the Atlas Obscura Podcast: a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Find the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps. Dylan Thuras: So you are an editorial fellow at Atlas. You’ve done a ton of writing for Gastro Obscura. And you’ve written a lot specifically about ancient food history. It’s kind of your beat. You are our ancient food history correspondent. And this is also a personal interest of yours. I heard that you recently taught an ancient Roman cooking class. Andrew: Yes. This was at an education venue in Brooklyn called the Brooklyn Brainery. This one that we just did recently was a hands-on cooking class, which was really fun. It was focused on simple Roman recipes, like what everyday people were eating. So we made an herb and cheese spread. We made a beverage using vinegar and honey. Dylan: How do you come up with these menus? How do you choose what you want to serve? Andrew: For this one, I wanted to focus on the food of everyday people. Because a lot of times, Romans and other historical cooking sources, they tend to be very biased towards the food of the elite because that was the stuff that gets written down and written about more. But there are a few examples of those simpler recipes. And I also try to choose things that I think people will actually enjoy eating, too. And if you see it through the lens of their food, it helps you really see ancient people as just living, normal, everyday people. The book that we’re talking about, it’s such an important source of information about ancient Greek and Roman food that if you start researching this topic, eventually you’re just going to run into it. Dylan: Yeah, so this obviously is like an important text. What does the name mean? Andrew: The whole book is written in Greek. So Deipnosophistae in Greek can be translated as “the philosophers at dinner” or like, “the wise people at dinner.” One scholar that I spoke with had a kind of funny translation. He translated it as “banquet wits,” and he said he likes this because it sounds a little bit like “twits.” And there is like a bit of irreverence or humor in the text itself. So, he thought that that was a funny way of translating it. Dylan: Yeah, I mean it shows you something about the culture, that there was so much kind of fine dining and social maneuvering happening in this space that someone would go to the trouble of producing a text, which was actually quite a lot of trouble back then, to be like, here’s kind of what you need to know. Andrew: It’s a very rambling book. The format is hard to pin down. The framing device is that it’s a bunch of people talking at a dinner party. So it’s kind of structured that as the courses of the dinner are coming out, they see a dish and it inspires them to talk about that ingredient. Like the food itself is inspiring what they’re talking about. And they’re telling stories and they’re quoting a lot from other authors. That’s what makes it such an interesting and important text is because it preserves the words of all of these earlier writers. And in some cases, you have writers whose work doesn’t survive in its entirety, but the little piece of it that’s quoted in Deipnosophistae is what we have that survives. Dylan: It’s like super meta because it’s like in the format of a dinner party conversation, but is also like a great quotes book so that you can reference it for your future dinner. So, Deipnosophistae contains these quotes, it contains these kind of philosophical tidbits, but it also seems like it also has real recipes in here. Andrew: Well, one of the most significant things is it contains the oldest recorded known recipe in Greek. During this time, especially the Greek cities in what is now Sicily, were known for kind of fancy haute cuisine. And so the recipe that we have in Deipnosophistae is for a grilled fish. It’s a type of fish called ribbon fish, and it’s topped with grated cheese and olive oil. Dylan: That sounds nice. That sounds delicious. Andrew: Yeah, I’ve tried it. Dylan: Oh, how was it? Andrew: I enjoyed it. I know it’s sometimes today, it's taboo to put cheese and fish together. Dylan: I don’t know, it seems okay. I’m Midwestern though, I’ll put cheese on literally anything. Andrew: Even in the ancient world, apparently there were some authors that disagreed with this. Even in ancient times, it was controversial. Dylan: I see, I see. What else is in this book? Andrew: Another really cool milestone that’s kind of preserved in Deipnosophistae is talking about those same cities from Sicily, like the city of Sybaris. They mentioned that master chefs in Sybaris could own a one-year patent on their recipes so that nobody would be allowed to make them except the creator. This is actually considered our earliest known evidence of patent law for intellectual property. Dylan: That’s amazing, because there isn’t actually patent law for recipes now. I like the idea of it being a one-year patent on a recipe because it’s kind of like, okay, you get a year to be a really hot star chef, and then everybody gets to take a crack at doing the thing. I kind of feel like that would be a good thing to bring back. So, this book’s fascinating because it’s so many things. In a way, it just reminds me of what I sometimes call a tidbits book, which collects a lot of little stories or a lot of quotes or just this and that. It reminds me of the books that people sometimes put on the back of a toilet, like the Uncle John’s Bathroom Reader kind of thing. The thing that you pick up and you sort of browse through it, it’s not really meant to be necessarily read in a go. You kind of open to some pages and go like, ah, interesting, very enlightening, and then you close it and you put it back on the back of the toilet. Andrew: There’s a couple of different interpretations as to why the book was actually written. Dylan: I assume it was to help me succeed at this dinner party, but apparently maybe something else. Andrew: Yeah, that’s for sure one interpretation. So the idea that Deipnosophistae is this manual on how to impress people and seem educated at a dinner party, that idea comes from Adam Cody, who is a professor of humanities at the Virginia Military Institute. His idea was that the structure is designed to help you remember a good quote or tidbit to share during different courses or when different things come out. So, if you’re thinking about, I want a good literary quote about oysters, where in the banquet do they serve oysters? Well, it’s usually an appetizer, so I look in the beginning of the book, and it’s like an indexing system for the book. Dylan: Right. A way of mapping what topics are right for what portion of the evening. Andrew: He compares it to, if you’ve heard of the mind palace memory technique, that is something that actually also comes from ancient Greece. It’s the idea that you visualize a physical space as a way of helping memorize and recall information. Dylan: Oh, right. That’s cool. I like that interpretation. That seems good. Andrew: Well, the other scholar that I spoke with was Douglas Olson, who is a classics professor at the University of Minnesota. He thinks of it more as an informational magazine that just has many articles and many points of view that maybe the purpose is just to highlight and preserve the best of Greek literature and the best of Greek culture. Because, it’s being written in the Roman Empire, but by a Greek who is writing in Greek and quoting from really old Greek literature. And it’s taking pride in the past accomplishments of the Greeks at a time when Greece is no longer a major power and Rome is very much the main power of the Mediterranean. But, collecting the best of what it means to be Greek. Dylan: There is something very interesting about writing a book that theoretically is about succeeding at a Roman dinner party and having it all be Greek literature quotes from a different era and empire. Do we know anything about the author? Andrew: We don’t know a ton about him. His name is Athenaeus of Naucratis. We know he was a Greek from Egypt and that maybe he was actually consulting stuff from the Library of Alexandria in order to write this. Dylan: You know, it’s interesting. There’s some kind of progressive, modern ideas in this book. What did other people think of the stuff that Athenaeus was writing about? Andrew: It’s quite interesting, because Athenaeus kind of subtly responds to and disagrees with what Plato said about food. Plato was actually very dismissive of cooking. Like, he didn’t think of cooking as a high art form. Just like, oh, it’s just something you have to do like in order to live, you have to eat. He didn’t really see the artistry of it. Dylan: Plato strikes me as someone who is like not taking a shower or eat. Like he was just living in his mind palace and not really into the, you know, realities of daily life. But Athenaeus felt, seems like he felt differently. Andrew: Oh, yes. But also, there’s this one interesting story in which cooking is celebrated as an art. That’s one of the most famous stories in Deipnosophistae. And so, what happens basically, is this king tells his chef when they’re far away from the ocean that he has a craving for fish and he challenges him to create a substitute for fish. Actually, I can read the quotation. Dylan: Yes, please do. Andrew: “The chef, he took a fresh turnip and cut it in slices thin and long, shaping it just like an anchovy. Then he parboiled it, poured oil upon it, sprinkled salt to taste, spread on the top exactly 40 seeds of black poppy, and satisfied the king’s desire in faraway Scythia. And when King Nicomedes had tasted the turnip, he sang the praises to his friends and he said, ‘The cook and the poet are just alike. The art of each lies in his mind.’” Dylan: That’s cool. It kind of sounds like it would be pretty good, actually. Andrew: When I was doing food history videos in the past, I actually made, I tried to recreate this. I did not count out exactly 40 poppy seeds, but other than that— Dylan: Close enough. Andrew: But I actually kind of could see how it works, because I took these little pieces of turnip and fried them and they got crispy and kind of savory. And I was like, I could see how it maybe resembles a small fried fish. Dylan: We talked at the start of this about the way in which food can connect you to these people of the past and sort of take them out of being these like imaginary fictional characters who are very different from you and just remind you like, these people are just living. They’re just kind of doing the same stuff we’re doing for the most part. If you could go to any ancient dinner party, what dinner party would you go to? Because I know there are some, some of them are recorded and quite famous. Do you ever think about your perfect Roman dinner party? Andrew: Well, actually I do have an answer for that. Dylan: I thought you might. Andrew: Yeah, I guess this is something I’ve—without realizing that I’ve thought about. There’s a lot of stories about the dinners and banquets of the Roman emperor Elagabalus who was legendarily super decadent. One of the ones that I always found interesting was that Elagabalus supposedly had these themed dinners where all the food was one specific color. So like, a blue dinner party or a white dinner party. And I’ve always been fascinated by that. I like a good theme when it comes to a dinner party. Dylan: Wait, which color would you go to? Now you got to be even more specific. Andrew: We have a surviving recipe that is associated with Elagabalus that’s for a chicken dish that’s very white. It’s in a creamy white sauce. And I think I always liked to think that maybe that was from the white party. So perhaps I would go to that one. Dylan: That seems like a good party. And you of all people, you more than anyone I know would actually be prepared to fit in, make small talk and, and make a good showing of yourself. I think book or no book, I would be in a lot of trouble. That was Andrew Coletti. He wrote a great article about Deipnosophistae, which also has in it a modern version of the oldest recorded Greek recipe: this recipe for grilled fish with cheese. Listen, live life on the edge, baby. Go try some fish cheese. You can check it out and try it for yourself. There is a link in the episode description.
