    "description": "How an enterprising couple have transformed their farm into a bucolic base amid cider orchards and vines – perfect for exploring an ancient landscape and flourishing arts sceneIn Old English its name meant “the land of the summer people”, after the local practice of coming down to the Somerset Levels after the winter flooding receded. Today, Somerset is still somewhere where seasons are felt vividly, as Sophie Brendel and Panu Long discovered when they and their two children moved to Thornfalcon, their farmstead in a village of the same name, 15 minutes’ drive from Taunton, at the end of 2022. Here, they are on constant weather watch, tending their young vines (Panu, now a winemaker, has a background in the drinks industry) and harvesting daily from the kitchen garden. They are also busy making plans for the apple harvest, which will go into the 150-year-old cider press.In addition, they have created a handful of places to stay on their 16-hectare (40-acre) site, which sprawls through woods, orchards and vines to a reed-fringed lake. Walking around it at the end of May, you feel the cusp of summer, from the water lilies coming into bloom and the nesting swan, guarded by her mate. “Soon the eggs will hatch, and later she’ll teach the cygnets to fly, before taking them down to the Somerset Levels,” says Sophie.

    "description": "A six-day hike on Arran – a new Unesco Geopark – reveals tales of dinosaurs, tectonic plate collisions and lightning strikes from millions of years agoAround 240m years ago, a 12-foot-long reptile called a chirotherium walked along a beach in what was then part of the supercontinent of Pangaea, and what is now the shoreline of Kildonan village, on the rugged, southern coast of the Isle of Arran. Natural dykes of black igneous rock – cooled magma – jut out into the ocean here. The houses on shore are backdropped by grassy cliffs.We know that this giant proto-crocodile once roamed here because it left behind footprints – which can still be seen today. “This is older than the dinosaurs,” says Malcolm Wilkinson of Arran Geopark, as we crouch down next to the trace fossil. I place my hand in the massive print and attempt to imagine the world millions of years ago, when Scotland sat just north of the equator and the climate was tropical. Continue reading...",

    "description": "This museum is not just a collection of over 55 classic cars, but a meticulously curated journey through American and global automotive history, spanning from 1906 to 2020. Visitors can expect to see everything from a 1906 Cadillac delivery truck to rare gems like a 1953 Oldsmobile Fiesta (one of only 458 ever made), a 1953 Buick Skylark, and a 1956 Cadillac Eldorado once owned by Marilyn Monroe. The oldest vehicle is a 1906 Cadillac delivery truck. The cars are restored to original specs, and driven to special events. Many have won awards at antique car shows. Each car has an informative plaque that provided historical context, production numbers, and technical details. The museum  recreates entire scenes from the past, such as a 1934 Texaco gas station with original pumps and products, a drive-in movie theater, and a Hollywood premiere backdrop with luxury cars and vintage film cameras.",

    "description": "There is no more poetic place to commemorate the discoveries of 19th-century Czech priest and father of genetics Gregor Johann Mendel than in a forest composed of five-meter-high bronze pea plants. The structure—which hides real DNA samples of important Czech personalities, including Mendel—visualize his third law of heredity about the independent combinability of specific gene variants. That is why nine round yellow peas, three round green peas, three wrinkled yellow peas, and one wrinkled green pea grow on the statue. (Observations of pea plants are what led Mendel to the founding principles of genetics.) Mendel studied for three years at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Olomouc, and then studied theology. He eventually completed his studies in Vienna, but didn’t pass the professorial exams. This gave him time to research pea hybridization using the biostatistical method in the monastery. But after the death of the local abbot in 1868, Mendel was elected to take his place—meaning he had less time for research. The only honor Mendel received during his life for his natural science discoveries was being elected vice-president of the local natural science society in 1869. William Bateson only translated Mendel’s work into English after his death, which, with a delay of 30 years, caused a new scientific revolution. In 2022, Mendel’s skeletal remains were exhumed and examined in 2021 as part of the celebration of the 200th anniversary of his birth.",
