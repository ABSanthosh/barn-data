    "description": "Rain isn’t the only thing that’s biblical in these parts … We explore a holy land of walks, pubs and crystal-clear night skies in CarmarthenshireThere’s no room at the inn in Bethlehem, Carmarthenshire. Because there’s no inn. No shops. Only a former post office turned private residence. I can see a few barns, but there’s not much else in this tiny linear village. The official population is almost 200, though only a few dozen live in the centre. There’s a primary school that closed in 1999 and now serves as the village hall. Some people still come to post Christmas cards here to get the local postmark, organised by a small local group who stamp the envelopes that can then be posted in a little red postbox by the village hall.I find the chapel, first built in 1800, down a side road, a couple of hundred yards to the south. The settlement was originally called Dyffryn Ceidrich (Ceidrich’s Valley), but after the chapel was baptised Bethlehem – a common enough name for a house of worship in Wales during its nonconformist heyday – it came to denote the area too. The stone building is tall and austere, with long, thin windows; it would have been the focal point of community life and – as any reader of Caradoc Evans’ My People will know – quite possibly a hotbed of sin, prejudice and hypocrisy. There are some weathered gravestones, with a smattering of Thomases, Davieses and Joneses, and in the morning mist it’s quite atmospheric. Continue reading...",

    "description": "With clean air, vast green spaces and more saunas than cars, Finns have plenty of reasons to be cheerfulAccording to the World Happiness Report, the cheeriest country in the world is one nature-loving Nordic nation – Finland. On paper, it’s not hard to see why. It’s one of the world’s least corrupt countries, built on a democracy and quick to give women the vote. Education, from daycare to university, is free. Crime is low, the water is clean, the air fresh and there are more saunas than cars. But is it noticeably a nice place to be? And can the Finns teach me (and the rest of the UK, which ranks 20th in the Happiness Report) anything about wellbeing in the land of forests and freedom?I start in Helsinki. With a population of just 630,000, this is a pocket-sized, but delightful capital city, buzzing with a Nordic foodie scene, a clutch of tech startups and its own design aesthetic, all bathed in up to 19 hours a day of sunlight in the summer. Over coffee at Nolita, his zero-waste restaurant and bakery, Serbian-born chef Luca Basic tells me that he came to Helsinki aged 19 and immediately decided to stay. So, what’s happiness in the city? He doesn’t hesitate. “It’s trust in the state. It goes beyond things like buses being on time, or my staff being able to afford to live in the middle of their city.” Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/e-pluribus-unum-mural",
    "description": "With debates raging over the use of artificial intelligence in art, it’s a good reminder that computers have aided artists for quite some time. An early example of this mix of technology and art can be found on the side of a building, through the massive E Pluribus Unum mosaic that is found on the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point campus.  The UWSP campus is otherwise not traditionally thought of as beautiful—it retains a lot of the gray concrete Brutalism found across America during the height of the 1960s and 1970s. This is the result of the school’s ninth president (and future governor of Wisconsin), Lee Sherman Dreyfus, who made it his mission to modernize the school. Dreyfus was gregarious and preferred unconventional outreach, at one point telling students, \"My initials are LSD and we’re going on a trip together somewhere!\" He saw UWSP as a potential technological marvel where one day every student could watch Mission: Impossible in their own dorm room, or even learn remotely by computer. To achieve this progressive vision, some of the past would have to go. At UWSP, the target was \"Old Main.\" This building, for nearly a century the center of campus, had been condemned and emptied by 1970. To salve losing this icon, Dreyfus tapped Richard C. Schneider, a UWSP art professor and ceramicist, with the challenge of preserving the building somehow on a wall of the new College of Natural Resources building. Professor Schneider’s answer would take the better part of a decade to build, and meet the president’s call for a futuristic campus. Schneider designed a mural that represented the university in the form of a universal human figure. The state of Wisconsin would be represented by state symbols such as the muskie and badger, and its history through a large representation of the Sauk leader Black Hawk. In the center of the image, the cupola of Old Main would be preserved. (Ironically, by 1976, the actual Old Main was also preserved after being placed on the National Historic Register, and it still stands today.) With the design in place, the execution relied on two key aspects: computer technology and volunteer labor. The design was divided into 286,200 squares by a computer, and each square was evaluated from light to dark on a 28-point scale. Twenty-eight matching tile designs were created, and then the work began. Volunteers would spend the next four years making the tiles according to the patterns, firing them, and then affixing them to panels in accordance with the overall design. Finally, by 1982, the last of the panels were affixed to the wall, and the mural was complete. The finished mural stands 150 feet long by 50 feet high, connected to 113 rows of panels by more than 7,000 screws. At the time of its completion, it was believed to be the largest computer-aided mural in the country. Just south of the mural, a plaza called the Specht Forum contained a sundial, to add to the feeling of natural resources. A renovation began in 2023 to refurbish and beautify the sundial for the next generation, to complete the vista. Even today, many former students still recall the incredible group effort that went into making this futuristic mosaic a reality. Despite being a technological wonder, Professor Schneider and his volunteers would end up glazing hundreds of thousands of tiles by hand for years to make it happen. The mural’s two names honor this shared effort, as it was entitled E Pluribus Unum, or in English, \"From Many, One.\"",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/dark-oxygen-moab-khotsong",
    "description": "Emil Ruff was about to travel into the center of the Earth. Wearing safety goggles, a protective suit, a helmet, and sturdy work boots, he was crammed in a large metal cage with his colleagues, along with several dozen miners on their morning shift, to descend down the world’s deepest single-shaft elevator. His ears popped as the elevator plunged downward at 60 kilometers per hour (37 mph). The lift made stops along the way. First one kilometer down. Then two. The elevator descended further. The air got hotter. Finally, at around 3 kilometers (nearly 2 miles), a mere four minutes later, Ruff and his team got off. After a short train ride, they reached a rocky tunnel that looked a lot like Mars, which is exactly what brought Ruff to these depths. He’s a microbiologist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole who studies organisms deep below Earth’s surface as a way to understand the possibility of life in the cosmos. Ruff is particularly interested in how microbes produce so-called \"dark oxygen,\" or oxygen found in the absence of light. A couple of years ago, he found microorganisms that appeared to have this ability in aquifers in Canada, a couple hundred meters below Earth’s surface. \"And so then I was wondering, well, how deep can you go and still find these organisms?\" he says. It was this question that led Ruff to Moab Khotsong, a 3.6-kilometer-deep (2.2 miles) mine and longtime scientific research site. The mine is in the Witwatersrand Basin, located in the northeast corner of South Africa, a region known for its rich gold reserves. Over the course of a century of mining, companies have dug deeper and deeper holes in pursuit of the precious metal. As a result, many of the world's deepest mines exist here. But mining in Witwatersrand has also unearthed something else: billion-year-old brine. This fluid is hidden in the cracks of ancient rocks and is the remnants of a shallow sea that existed in the basin long ago. \"There's hardly any other way, or any other place on Earth, where you can go really that deep and also [that far] back into time,\" Ruff says. By studying the brine, Ruff and other scientists hope to learn not only more about life in Earth’s early history, but also how it may be able to survive in extreme environments beyond our own planet. In fact, science and mining have had a long relationship in this part of South Africa. Esta van Heerden, a geochemist in the area, has been working for several decades with mining companies. She describes it as \"a symbiotic relationship.\" Scientists are able to go to these hard-to-access places to study mysteries like ancient life and seismic activity, while companies could gain data on the risks and remediation of their activities. The research around microbes at Moab Khotsong, however, originated primarily with one person: the late Princeton University geologist Tullis Onstott, who passed away in 2021. An expert on South Africa’s ancient subterranean water, Onstott was part of an international scientific drilling project investigating active faults in the area. But when drilling in Moab Khotsong intersected a pocket of ancient brine, Onstott organized a different kind of field expedition. In 2018, along with collaborators from Belgium, Japan, and South Africa, he traveled into the mine’s depths to set up infrastructure for an underground laboratory to study the possibility of ancient life. The laboratory includes a series of tubes and hoses that allow researchers to collect samples of the brine. \"It's a tap you could open, and the water comes out of this borehole,\" says Ruff. But getting the water out of these deep tunnels can be hot and strenuous work. \"Sometimes we would carry these… basically large containers that can hold up to like, 10 liters (2.6 gallons) of brine,\" says Devan Nisson, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Ames Research Center who has worked at Moab Khotsong both with Onstott and on other projects. She recalls often needing the help of mine workers to carry the heavy containers through the tunnels and bring samples back to the surface for further analysis. The Moab Khotsong brine has high levels of oxygen, but no one really knows how it got there. Over the years, researchers have started to get a clearer picture of the fluids at Moab Khotsong. For instance, they estimate that the brine is ancient, over a billion years old. It’s seven times saltier than seawater, says Nisson, a characteristic of water that has been isolated for a really long time. The age of the brine is further supported by its levels of argon, which gradually accumulates in the fluid as radioactive elements in the surrounding rock decay. Life, too, is possible in the brine, as Nisson’s recent research has detailed. Coauthor and microbiologist Julio Castillo, at the University of the Free State in Johannesburg, is particularly interested in how these microbes here can produce phosphorus, another element that’s foundational to life as we know it. Other scientists have also found viruses swimming in the mine’s walls. But one mystery remains: dark oxygen. The Moab Khotsong brine has high levels of oxygen, but no one really knows how it got there. This is what Ruff is looking into. \"Oxygen is a powerful molecule,\" he says, a way for life to thrive. But reactions that create oxygen, especially without light, are extremely rare. There are two main hypotheses about how the dark oxygen at Moab Khotsong is produced. First, radioactivity can split water molecules through a reaction called radiolysis, one way dark oxygen can be created—and, in addition to gold, Moab Khotsong is a uranium mine. It was long assumed that this was the source of dark oxygen at the mine, but, says Ruff, \"nobody has ever really tested that hypothesis.\" Ruff is interested in the other possibility: that microbes are creating the dark oxygen. \"Certain microbes seem to have figured out a sort of very wild chemical reaction to produce oxygen to a point where it seems to actually accumulate in the ecosystem,\" he says. In his past research, Ruff has observed how microorganisms use nitric oxide to make oxygen without the presence of light. He’s currently conducting tests to see if these tiny life-forms, or others, are living in South Africa. During his trip in August, Ruff first sampled a groundwater aquifer at a depth of 1.2 kilometers (0.75 miles), and then the Moab Khotsong brine at a depth of 2.9 kilometers (1.8 miles). He’s now analyzing chemical signatures of the oxygen within the samples for clues about its origin. Ruff’s work to understand dark oxygen has implications far beyond Earth’s deepest mines. Moab Khotsong’s ancient, hidden ecosystem exists at high temperatures, pressures, and salinity, and has been buried for over a billion years. And yet life persists. This extreme environment is similar to what scientists think exists below the surface of Mars, potentially including water left over from shallow seas in the planet’s deep past. \"If any life ever existed on Mars, it was microbial, and if any of it survived, it was very likely in pockets of brines deep, deep in the rock,\" says Ruff, whose research may decipher one of the secrets of life on Earth—and elsewhere.",
