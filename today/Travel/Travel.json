    "description": "With free public transport for all – including tourists - exploring the vineyards, mysterious canyons and lush forests of the Grand Duchy couldn’t be easierI am not sure what surprises me most when I get off the train at Luxembourg’s main station – the sheer friendliness of locals who seem to greet everyone as they pass by with a cheery Moien (hello), or the fact that from this point I will not be paying a penny to travel the length and breadth of the Grand Duchy.Five years ago, Luxembourg became the first country in the world to actively tackle its carbon footprint by making all public transport free for everyone, including tourists. So I have come to see how it works in practice, aiming to travel to the country’s little known vineyards hugging the slopes along the Moselle River and then trek through the mysterious canyons and forests of the Mullerthal region.

    "description": "Every empire needs a core. For a nearly ubiquitous national franchise like Half Price Books, that core can be found in the form of an enormous book warehouse in Dallas, Texas. Situated across the street from the former laundromat where Half Price Books got its start, the vast flagship location—five-times larger than their average store—holds over half a million books, multiple reading rooms, and even a built-in café.  Though its business model is centered around providing bargain prices on used books, some exceptional books have landed at this literary warehouse as well. Signed and rare books worth hundreds of dollars are showcased in glass cases around the store. Befitting their slogan, \"We buy and sell anything printed or recorded except yesterday's newspaper,\" the Half Price Books flagship store also has movies, board games, records, and other forms of media.  As the flagship Half Price Books, this location holds onto some truly top-flight books. Visitors will find a vault of books open for them to walk inside, featuring the rarest and oldest items in the store's vast collection.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/otowa-bridge",
    "description": "In the early morning cold, steam fog rises from the slow-moving Setsuri River. Frost encases every surface in sparkling white. As the sun rises, the calls of red-crowned cranes—among the rarest cranes in the world—echo through the stillness. Red-crowned cranes are an iconic symbol in East Asian art and culture, representing luck, longevity, and fidelity. In the Indigenous Ainu language, the bird is known as sarurun kamuy or \"god of the marsh.\" The cranes use the Setsuri River as a nightly roosting spot because the river does not freeze in winter, despite temperatures dropping as low as -20 Celsius. The nondescript Otowa Bridge also happens to be the best place to see large groups of red-crowned cranes as they leave their night roost for their feeding grounds in the nearby farmlands.  Amid concerns of extinction in Japan, a population of red-crowned cranes was discovered in the marshes near Kushiro in the 1920s, setting into motion several conservation laws and the declaration of the birds as a natural monument. The Japanese population now sits at around 1,900. While the species has been downgraded from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable,\" populations in China and Korea face steep decline due to habitat degradation.",
