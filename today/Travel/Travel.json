    "description": "The longest night/shortest day is celebrated at the famous prehistoric site, but there are many other atmospheric locations to welcome the returning of the light on 21 DecemberFrom the outside it looks like a grass-covered UFO, its curved, chalk-white walls gleaming amid the green countryside. Yet inside is one of the most impressive prehistoric constructions in Europe. Rediscovered in 1699, but only excavated in the 1960s, Newgrange in the Boyne Valley is a Neolithic passage tomb that has been dated to about 3,200BC (older than the Egyptian pyramids) and is so well made it’s never once sprung a leak. But that’s not its most impressive feature – the builders created an elaborate roof box that once a year, on winter solstice (shortly after sunrise on 21 December 2024), allows light to creep into the main passageway and illuminate the tomb chamber for 17 minutes. An annual lottery decides who gets to witness it, but visitors can wait outside and cheer the arrival of the sunlight. If you miss it, they artificially recreate the phenomenon on every tour. Tickets €18 per adult, or watch it live online Continue reading...",

It’s also a way to celebrate the capital’s diverse communities and histories. For those wishing to explore further, I have walked six routes using stations on each line which take in dozens of landmarks with connections to the themes, from gardens and galleries to historic houses and monuments.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/xemxija-old-carob-tree",
    "description": "This tree, thought to be over 1,000 years old, is truly remarkable, not just because of its age but also due to its link to Malta's ancient farming methods. The carob tree, which is native to the Mediterranean, has been grown on the island for many years for its sturdy pods. These pods were important for food, animal feed, and even as a way to measure precious stones, leading to the term \"carat.\"  The tree's large size and its twisted, sprawling branches make it a beautiful sight for visitors. Its bark is deeply marked by time, and the wide spread of its limbs gives it a grand, almost magical presence. This old carob tree symbolizes Malta's rich farming traditions, and its long life showcases how well carob trees can adapt to the island's dry climate. For centuries, the carob tree has been important to Malta's rural economy, with its pods used in different ways, especially in baking, sweets, and traditional Maltese dishes. What makes the Xemxija Old Carob Tree especially interesting is its connection to nearby Roman beehives and ancient ruins found along the Xemxija Heritage Trail. The tree may have been there during those ancient times, quietly observing the rise and fall of different civilizations in the area. The trail takes visitors through Malta’s rich history, and the Old Carob Tree stands as a reminder of the strong ties between the people and the land they worked. Carob trees like this one were crucial to the ancient Maltese economy; their value went beyond just providing food. The pods served as a sweetener and a substitute for chocolate, and during hard times, they became an essential food source. The carob tree thrived in Malta's rocky soil and dry climate, making it an ideal crop for survival, and its widespread use during the Punic and Roman periods highlights how vital this tree was to life on the island. Visiting the Xemxija Old Carob Tree allows you to appreciate the endurance of nature while also thinking about the tree's role in Malta’s cultural and agricultural history. The tree offers shade to those walking along the trail and creates a peaceful, calming atmosphere—perfect for taking a break and enjoying the beautiful Maltese countryside.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/top-o-hill-terrace-texas",
    "description": "One of Dallas's best-kept secrets remains just as recondite as it was during its Prohibition heyday. Top o' Hill Terrace, known to some as \"Vegas before Vegas,\" was designed and built to cover outright debauchery under a façade of only the most prim and proper dining that the suburbs of Dallas could offer.  Top o' Hill Terrace began its life as exactly what it seemed to be: an exclusive, upstanding restaurant nestled in a beautiful, spacious campus at one of the highest points in the county. But with the opening of the Arlington Downs horse track nearby, came the opportunity to bet on its races. By the late 1920s, Top o' Hill Terrace had been literally hollowed out to a new purpose.  The facility retained its elite status even as a casino was built in its recesses and new underground rooms. To keep law enforcement from ending the extremely illegal fun, the Terrace was reconfigured into a veritable labyrinth of escape tunnels and secret entrances and exits. Hidden corridors were planned out masterfully, deflecting many a police raid as patrons who had been gambling minutes before posed themselves around innocuous pots of tea.  Due to the advanced security and the renown already attached to Top o' Hill Terrace, it drew in such high rollers as John Wayne, Frank Sinatra, and Howard Hughes to gamble shoulder-to-shoulder alongside notorious criminals. It became one of the most prestigious casinos in America, and its sinful influence clashed with the values of the local clergy people. The First Baptist Church of Fort Worth, the most outspoken critics of the secretive gambling operation, had the last laugh in the 1950s. A Texas Ranger raid finally succeeded in catching Top o' Hill Terrace and its patrons off guard, bringing its fun to an end once and for all. The First Baptist Church bought the location, converting it into a seminary and letting the sordid underbelly remain hidden.  In the late 2010s, with the selection of a new president for what is now Arlington Baptist University, the secrets began to leak out. Led by the new president's wife, school staff have begun efforts to restore and preserve the history of Top o' Hill Terrace, and even launched a crowdfunding campaign to begin excavating the secret rooms hidden under their campus.",
