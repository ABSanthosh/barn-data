Here are some of the bestSouthampton has a significant part to play in the Austen story: after the death of her father in 1805, she moved with her mother and sister to live in the city for three years, taking a house on Castle Square. The Jane Austen Heritage Trail links eight sites around the city that the younger Jane would have known, including the Dolphin Hotel (currently facing an uncertain redevelopment future) where she attended a ball to celebrate her 18th birthday (visitsouthampton.co.uk/janeausten250).

    "description": "Tucked between classrooms and coffee-fueled study sessions, a massive concrete slab stands outside Kennesaw State University’s Social Sciences building. This 10-foot-tall, 2.7-ton piece of the Berlin Wall once served as a brutal barrier between East and West Germany. Today, it rests in suburban Georgia as a powerful reminder of division, unity, and the passage of time. Originally gifted to Senator Chuck Clay, grandson of General Lucius D. Clay, the architect of the Berlin Airlift, this section of the Wall was donated to the university during the 30-year anniversary of the wall coming down in 2019, to honor German-American relations and the fight for freedom. The plaque at its base tells the story: \"The Berlin Wall separating West Germany and East Germany was erected on August 13, 1961. It became one of the most powerful and visible symbols of the Cold War. On November 9, 1989, the East German government allowed citizens to visit West Germany, and Germans on both sides began tearing the wall down. The fall of the wall prompted German reunification, which was completed on October 3, 1990. This piece of the wall is loaned to Kennesaw State University by Senator Chuck Clay, grandson of General Lucius D. Clay of Marietta, who served as Military Governor of Germany (1945-1949) and is best known for engineering the Berlin airlift, breaking the Soviet blockade of Berlin in 1948-49. He later represented President Kennedy in Berlin during the Wall Crisis of 1961. This piece of the wall was given to Senator Clay by the Checkpoint Charlie Museum in Berlin to honor the memory of General Clay, and as a reminder of the friendship between the people of Germany and the United States of America.\" Students rush past, noses buried in textbooks and phones, doing yoga in the gazebo nearby, often unaware of the history standing just steps away. This segment, with its smiling sun, is a tangible reminder of the past, urging reflection on the walls that still divide us today.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/levadura-de-olla",
    "description": "As an enterprising teenager growing up in San Mateo Yucutindoo (population 2,500) in Oaxaca’s remote Sierra Sur region, Thalía Barrios García financed her first bakery by peddling goods she’d buy in bigger cities to locals. As a culinary school student, she almost got expelled for selling home-made tacos and fruit ices to classmates.  Her grit and persistence paid off. In 2019, she used her savings to open a little patio restaurant, Levadura de Olla, naming it after the homemade ferments that women used to bake claypot breads in her village. Here, she began to nurture her real calling as an anthropologist chef, traveling to remote Oaxacan communities to ferret out ritual recipes, such as the one for the austere mole chichilla, smoky and bitter because it’s served at wakes.   After her little place proved such a success, in 2023 Barrios moved to a far more spacious patio restaurant seating over 100. In 2024, aged 28, she was awarded a Michelin star for food that manages to be ethnographic, yet creative and personal. Upon entering Levadura de Olla one passes a dedicated “tomato room” with a wooden table arrayed with hundreds of Oaxacan nightshades of every color and shape. Some of them star in Barrios’ signature salad set on an electric pink beet purée and dressed in a house-fermented fruit vinegar.  From the anthropological part of the menu called platillos de salvaguarda, one can order a complex mole de fiesta thickened with masa and served with taut crunchy pozole kernels, or a village breakfast dish of crumpled tortillas called machucadas presented with cheese and three different chile sauces.  The most delicious offerings though are on the menu’s “creativo” side, like the super-tender requesón (fresh cheese) tamal enriched with some butter and served with two moles, negro and coloradito, and a lovely zucchini flower. Or the unusual almond-and-chile mole scented with guava, which sauces battered fried cauliflower and shrimp. Among the inspired desserts there’s a pre-Hispanic corn-thickened gelée called nicautole, here made of burnt milk and accompanied by a prickly pear granita.",
