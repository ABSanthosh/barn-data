    "description": "A new trail follows the 26-mile route of the world’s first passenger train journey on the Stockton and Darlington RailwayIt was as strange a sight as you could stumble upon in the English countryside. As a muggy summer’s day began outside Shildon, Durham – rain threatening, bees drowsy in the hedgerows – I found myself standing on an embankment, surveying two rows of colossal stone teeth jutting through the earth. It looked as if someone had buried a sleeping giant.“You wouldn’t believe it by looking at it, but this is one of railway history’s most amazing feats,” my companion, rail expert Richie Starrs, said as we gazed down at the molars beneath our feet. A closer look revealed they were abandoned rail sleepers, laid out between the hawthorns and along which coal wagons were once pulled uphill by steam traction locomotives. “This is the Brusselton Incline, a section of the original Stockton and Darlington Railway. Nationally, it’s a story that’s not well known, but it’s one we’re rightly proud of.” Continue reading...",

    "description": "Breckland is a little-known part of England that sings with peace and rare wildlife. It would undoubtedly be a national park if so much of it hadn’t been commandeered by the military. But there is a place to stay on its bordersThe small white signs with red lettering are dotted through the landscape: “Military training area – keep out”. It adds to the eerie feel of unusually quiet roads and twisted Scots pines, which gather the long summer dusk around them.But when we arrive at our accommodation on an old farm bordering a forbidden area where the British army conduct secretive manoeuvres, the whole place sings with peace. A red kite cavorts in the breeze over handsome parkland, a cuckoo calls and, down by the Wissey, a gin-clear chalk stream, reed warblers chunter from deep within the rushes. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/genbudo-park",
    "description": "Nestled in the hills along the Maruyama River in northern Hyogo Prefecture, Genbudo Park is a geological site unlike any other in Japan. It’s home to a series of natural caves formed about 1.6 million years ago when volcanic lava cooled and cracked into towering hexagonal basalt columns. Though other examples of columnar basalt exist around the world, few combine such dramatic formations with cultural significance and easy public access. The five caves found in the park are Genbudo Cave, Seiryudo Cave, Kita Suzakudo Cave, Minami Suzakudo Cave, and Byakkodo Cave. Each is named after legendary creatures from Chinese mythology, including the Azure Dragon and White Tiger. As visitors walk along the quiet stone paths, they can view towering basalt walls, some rising several stories high. The columns are so sharply defined that they appear almost impossibly precise. It was here, in the late 1800s, that researchers collected rock samples that led to the coining of the word “basalt” in modern geology. In recognition of its importance, Genbudo was designated a National Natural Monument in 1931, and in 2022 it was selected as one of the “100 Geological Heritage Sites of the World” by the IUGS, a UNESCO-affiliated organization. Even though it has become more popular in recent years, Genbudo still feels calm and uncluttered. The site combines striking rock formations, local folklore, and gentle riverside paths. Visitors often stop by for a quiet walk, a scenic break, or a moment to take in the natural surroundings.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hunter-house-hamburgers",
    "description": "Surrounded by modern condos and office buildings in the Detroit suburb of Birmingham, Michigan, a small building clad in white porcelain panels has been serving hamburger sliders for nearly 75 years. Inside, the roadside restaurant features an open grill where cooks smash tiny balls of beef into a bed of sizzling onions, the aroma of which emanates throughout. Stainless steel stools with black vinyl seat cushions line the simple counter, while family photos, vintage street signs, and an old-fashioned illuminated menu board adorn the walls. The 900-square-foot interior has hardly changed since Hunter House’s doors opened in 1952—that’s when it was founded by local entrepreneur Don Ellenwood—and same goes for its simple burger-and-fries-forward menu. (They only added onion rings in 2011. It was a big deal.) Ellenwood ran Hunter House until he passed away. Then, in 1982, it was purchased by Al and Martha Papazian. It has remained in their family for three generations. A number of development plans in recent decades have threatened to displace the Birmingham mainstay. In the mid-2000s, an idea was floated to incorporate Hunter House into a new hotel development, which was never realized. And in 2019, news broke that a developer wanted to tear down the restaurant to make way for a mixed-use building, but public outcry prevented city planners from moving the proposal forward. Today, the local landmark continues to stand the test of time. Pass by its corner location on Woodward Avenue, and you’ll probably catch the scent of grilled onions.",
