    "description": "Only a few miles but a world away from overcrowded Snowdon, the quieter paths and rugged slopes of the Rhinogydd offer a walk on the region’s wildest mountainAs soon as I stepped within the stone circle of Cerrig Arthur, the strange noise began. It came from the far side of the valley – a long, hoarse scream. Then it became louder, growing into an ear-splitting thunder. I jammed my fingers into my ears – but still felt its sonic explosion down in my stomach. The cloud lay low over the stone circle that evening, so it was impossible to tell where the terrible sound was coming from. I might have half-imagined that Cerrig Arthur had unleashed some ancient sorcery, or that this was the return of the legendary king the circle is named for.But really, I knew what it was. Military training flights often pass over these Gwynedd hills. The roar was a jet fighter streaking right over my head. The disturbance was quickly over. In truth, there were few people to disturb.

    "description": "Aloe is a broadly used plant in cosmetics, medicine, food, and much more. Coupled with the fact that it is an easy-to-grow succulent, this makes it the ideal product to farm in warm places. Sitting at the foot of the Langeberg Mountain range, Albertinia known as the home of aloe. The plants are prolific here and the leaves are collected and drained for their useful properties. While there are many aloe farms, there is only one aloe statue of this size.  Unveiled in 2010, this nine-meter-tall statue depicts Aloe ferox, also known as Cape Aloe or bitter aloe. It was created by Dirk van Wyk and Froncois de Wet. The aloe statue weighs over 2,500 kilograms. Around it grow normal sized aloe plants. Typically growing to a height of no more than three meters, they are dwarfed by their sculpted counterpart.",

    "description": "The island of Enoshima is a popular tourist attraction near Kamakura, visited by tens of thousands of people daily. All visitors cross the bridge from Fujisawa-Katase, and most go straight into the Benzaiten shopping street, an approach to Enoshima Shrine, walking past the seaside North Green Park. There is not much to see in the park itself, apart from a few monuments and a view of Sagami Bay. But in a corner stands a fountain with a curious group of statues, depicting women of various kinds. At the center of the fountain is Benzaiten, the Japanese equivalent to Hindu deity Saraswati, to whom the whole island is dedicated to. Around her, there are Kannon, the Buddhist goddess of mercy; a Southeast Asian dancer; a Hellenistic maiden; and a post-Renaissance European woman. This eclectic fountain was created by local sculptor Kensei Katō in 1964 in commemoration of the Tokyo Olympics, celebrating women around the world—or of the East and the West, to be precise.",
