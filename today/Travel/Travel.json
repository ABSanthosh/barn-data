This fine city, with easy access to the Norfolk waterways and shores, had anchored much of my adult life and was a wonderful place to have lived and grown. Yet I had become restless, like a guest who had overstayed his welcome and yearned for fresh horizons. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Young Serbians are keen to celebrate the Yugoslav era, and offering tours of their country in vintage Yugos is a fun way of doing it‘Jump in, comrade,” my driver honks and calls out the window of the smallest, boxiest car I’ve ever seen: the communist vintage Yugo. I’m setting off on a tour of Yugoslav-era Belgrade with driver Vojin Žugić from Yugoverse tours, a company in the business of cold-war nostalgia. The car is a time capsule, with its little cube headlights, cranky gear stick and cassette player. Its horn sounds delightfully cheeky, and the smell of diesel and old leather seats is strong. We trundle around the Serbian capital for half a day, taking in communism’s most striking bridges and sites, honking merrily at the many drivers who overtake us. All of them smile and wave, for the Yugo holds fond memories in this part of the world.Driving around the hippodrome next to Ada Bridge, or under the gravity-defying arch of the experimental brutalist Genex tower, it’s easy to get caught up in Žugić’s nostalgia – even though he’s only 24. “I love the feel of the mechanics, the simple geometry,” he says of the car. We park at the tower and take the lift to the top floor at 140 metres for spectacular city views from its spaceship-like windows. When it was designed in 1977, this was architecture of an imagined socialist utopia. Though the concrete is a bit shabby up close, the tower has kept its photogenic appeal. Just like our Yugo.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/devils-punch-bowl",
    "description": "The picturesque but rugged Oregon Coast is known for its numerous natural features formed by cliff erosion. Devils Punchbowl stands out with its red-and-yellow sandstone walls, which contrast well with the black rocks at low tide. At high tide, the scene of the waters churning within the rocks gave the bowl the nickname of \"Satan's Cauldron.\" According to geologists, the cliffs here are around 80,000 years old, and where formed by tectonic uplift. Sea caves form naturally along the cliffs. The Devil's Punchbowl itself formed when two caves were joined together by erosion and then collapsed. The black rocks on the floor of the Punchbowl are originally from its ceiling. All of these processes occurred relatively easily because the marine sandstone here is much softer than other rocks. This also means the Punchbowl and the surrounding cliffs are prone to further erosion and collapse.",
