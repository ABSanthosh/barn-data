    "description": "From traditional festivities in the Arctic Circle to blaring techno on the banks of the Seine, our tipsters celebrate midsummer across Europe• Tell us about your favourite UK coastline – the best tip wins a £200 holiday voucherI enjoyed midsummer at a rented beachside cottage in the Skåne village of Bjärred, north of Malmö, with Swedish friends. We ventured to the local church to enjoy the dancing round a midsummer pole decorated with vibrant blue and red flowers, with many local residents adorned in intricately decorated flower crowns. After taking a dip in the Öresund strait along the long jetty with its bathhouse, we towelled off to indulge in deliciously sweet strawberries and sip Briska ciders into the late hours of daylight.Caitlin Continue reading...",

But you don’t need to have deep pockets to enjoy its great food sceneMany renowned dining destinations have hosted the annual “food Oscars” – the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. This year is the first time the honour goes to Italy, with Turin, capital of Piedmont, holding the ceremony on 19 June. Although Emilia-Romagna is usually regarded as the country’s food capital, Piedmont has a proud gastronomic tradition, with white truffles, rice, chocolate, pastas and cheeses, not to mention wines such as barolo and barbaresco.Greener than most Italian cities, Turin, the former capital of Savoy and briefly capital of Italy, also has elegant piazzas, royal palaces, possibly Europe’s biggest outdoor market and the wide Po River for strolling, cycling and kayaking. It is where vermouth (see below), grissini breadsticks and espresso coffee were invented. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Las Vegas, the City of Lights, is renowned for its glittering casinos and captivating attractions that lure millions of visitors each year. While most of the action happens within the casino walls, an intriguing phenomenon is unfolding in the parking lots. The Las Vegas parking lot shoe prints are a curious trend thought to have originated in the early 1990s at the STRAT Hotel. Theories regarding the shoe mark tradition abound; some believe it brings good luck to casino-goers, while others attribute it to intoxicated patrons en route to their cars. Experts suggest that the phenomenon could be a prime example of “collective behavior,” wherein unrelated and unorganized individuals engage in similar actions. Casino management’s stance on the shoe mark tradition varies widely. Some establishments vehemently oppose the practice and will ban individuals caught participating, while others have long since accepted it as a quirky part of Las Vegas culture. Whether you view the phenomenon as a harmless custom or an unwelcome nuisance, it undeniably adds another layer of intrigue to this bustling metropolis.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dewey-square-pylon-bent-38",
    "description": "At the intersection of Purchase Street and Congress Street in downtown Boston is a lime-green-colored metal object covered in bolts and rivets. To the casual observer, it’s just another fixture of Boston’s urban landscape, but for those who remember the city during the second half of the 20th century, this pylon is one of the last surviving elements of one of the city’s most infamous and reviled transportation projects.  Completed in 1959, the John F. Fitzgerald Expressway was designed to accommodate Boston’s growing population and postwar car boom. Although intended to help alleviate congestion and ease commutes into the city, it soon found itself having the opposite effect. In order to build the expressway, around 20,000 residents had to be displaced, and hundreds of historic buildings were destroyed. As the years went by, public works projects designed to complement the expressway were canceled. In addition to the heavy traffic, the expressway itself had flaws and shortcomings, such as no breakdown lanes, severe curves, and no room to merge or slow down to exit. The problems associated with the expressway earned it nicknames such as “The Distressway,” “the world’s longest parking lot,” and “the other Green Monster.” During the construction of the Big Dig, much of the Central Artery in the city was rerouted and moved underground into the newly constructed O’Neill Tunnel. The expressway was finally demolished in 2003 and replaced with the Rose Kennedy Greenway linear park. Today, all that remains of the expressway are the Dewey Square Pylon and support beam Bent 38 near Quincy Market. As the final remnants of the highway fade into history, the memorial serves as a symbol of Boston’s complicated transportation history and the impact it’s had on the local community. It’s also a testament to the labor of countless men and women who strived over the years to improve the city’s infrastructure.",
