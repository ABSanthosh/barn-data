    "description": "Only accessible to snowshoers and skiers in winter, the Grand St Bernard Hospice has been a refuge for centuries and is the perfect place for a meditative mountain breakIt was a freezing December day when mountain guide Kingsley Jones first saw a rescue monk in action. He was leading a small group up the ominously named Combe des Morts when he passed by a rescue hut – one of many that dot this avalanche-prone area – and noticed a woman inside struggling in the freezing cold. He offered his assistance and she told him she’d already phoned for help. And it soon arrived, in the form of an Augustine monk – on skis, equipped with a hot flask of grenadine and warm layers, who escorted her to the safety of nearby Hospice du Grand St Bernard, a monastery and travellers’ hostel on Col du Mont-Joux at 2,473m.This kind of rescue has taken place in the mountain passes around Col du St Bernard on the Swiss-Italian border since 1050. And despite the changes in outdoor gear, modes of rescue and avalanche locator technology over the centuries, the hospice (set up by St Bernard of Aosta to offer refuge to pilgrims walking the Via Francigena pilgrim path from Canterbury to Rome) has remained largely unchanged.

    "description": "In Welsh tradition, a caerdroia is a turf maze typically imitating the Cretan labyrinth of Greek mythology. Translated as either a \"Castle of Turning\" for its many twists or the \"Walls of Troy,\" in reference to The Iliad's fabled lost city, these mysterious paths could once be found throughout this region. The paths typically lead to a raised hillock, thought to have once been used in ritual dances. Much of the folklore surrounding these turf mazes has been lost.  In 2005, a caerdroia was brought back to life in Gwydir Forest, Conwy, a scenic woodland in the Snowdonia region. A social enterprise based in Llanrwst called Golygfa Gwydyr, Theatre Cynefin, and local youths contributed to its creation. Measuring roughly a mile in length, it is thought to be the largest forest labyrinth in the world. Visitors are invited to embark on a meditative wander through its many turns.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-john-lauder-memorial",
    "description": "The Lauder Monument in the small hamlet of Glenbranter, Scotland, is a poignant tribute to a fallen soldier of World War I. Built in 1921, this solemn monument commemorates John Lauder, the eldest son of Sir Harry Lauder, a renowned Scottish singer and entertainer. John Lauder served as a captain in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and tragically lost his life in France on December 28, 1916, at the young age of 25. Erected by Sir Harry Lauder, the monument stands as a heartfelt memorial to his beloved son and to all those who served and died during the Great War. Sir Harry Lauder, born in 1870, was a celebrated Scottish entertainer known for his charming stage presence and comedic talent. His career spanned music halls and vaudeville stages, where he became famous for his distinctive style, characterized by wearing a kilt and carrying a crooked walking stick. Lauder's repertoire included popular Scottish songs such as \"Roamin' in the Gloamin',\" \"I Love a Lassie,\" and \"A Wee Deoch-an-Doris,\" which endeared him to audiences worldwide. His success extended beyond the United Kingdom, as he performed internationally and even made several tours of the United States. Sir Harry's contribution to entertainment was so significant that he was knighted in 1919, in recognition of his efforts during World War I, during which he tirelessly raised funds for the war effort and entertained troops. The Lauder Monument is situated in the remote peaceful grounds of Glenbranter, the Lauder family estate near Cairndow. The site offers visitors a tranquil setting to reflect on the sacrifices made during the war while taking in the natural beauty of the area. The monument’s inscriptions detail John Lauder’s military service and his ultimate sacrifice.",
