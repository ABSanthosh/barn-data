    "description": "A wave of immigration during the communist years has seen a slow burn for Vietnamese food – from beef noodles to green rice ice-cream – in the Czech Republic’s capitalAn older Asian woman is hunched over a gas burner serving noodles, a young couple in the distance shuffle piously into a tiny Buddhist temple, and a perpetual gaggle of families emerge from a Vietnamese supermarket armed with giant sacks of rice. It is a scene as authentically Vietnamese as I could expect to find. But I am not in Vietnam or even Asia. I am in Prague.Sapa, or Little Hanoi as it is affectionately known, is the hub of the Czech Republic capital’s Vietnamese community, and is a far cry from the spires, dumplings and beer-sploshed splendour of the historical centre. Tucked inconspicuously on its outskirts, this city within a city is where the nation’s Vietnamese people come to stock up on spices, eat plates of bun cha or sell inordinate amounts of large, fluffy geese.

    "description": "The route follows in the Romantic poet’s footsteps, traces his life and celebrates the landscapes that inspired so much of his work‘Come forth into the light of things,” implored William Wordsworth in his 1798 poem The Tables Turned, extolling the virtues of a good old-fashioned walk in nature. Treading through his homeland of the Lake District more than two centuries later, on a radiant early spring day, sunbeams casting through the bare branches to anoint the daffodils, it’s a compelling edict.As a founding father of England’s Romantic poetry movement, Wordsworth’s legacy is synonymous with the rolling, rugged landscapes of the Lakes. He and his contemporaries Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey were collectively known as the “Lake Poets”, and to gaze on the region’s deep, still waters and scrabble across its fells is to understand the source of his artistic inspiration, centuries on.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/volcan-pabellones",
    "description": "When it comes to points of nature around the world, sometimes it’s difficult to find truth on what site truly earns an honorific. There are numerous claims by local tour guides and on the Internet about the “smallest” volcano in the world. Volcán Pabellones, about 26 feet (8 meters) high and approximately 13 feet (4 meters) in diameter, just might take the crown. The tiny volcano sits behind small houses off a through road hours south of Cusco. Surrounded by a small fence and marked with a modest plaque, it receives few visitors—on a typical day, there were no tourists around. Other contenders for the title of world’s smallest volcano include Cuexcomate in Mexico, which is said to be 43 feet (13 meters) tall. Problem is that, while it’s called a volcano, many actually consider it to be a geyser. Meanwhile, the Taal Volcano in the Philippines is touted online as the smallest active volcano, though it is about 1,020 feet (311 meters) tall. An emerging area of research for volcanologists—yes, this is a job title—is very tiny volcanoes. There is one being studied in Colombia that is just 3 centimeters tall. The area around it that is closed off is only 10 centimeters. These tiny volcanoes are scientifically interesting, but perhaps so small that there’s not much to see. Volcán Pabellones is worth a stop because it’s large enough to truly come across as a volcano, but yet, it’s mini.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/machu-colca-peru",
    "description": "There are other “Machus” than Machu Picchu. “Machu” simply means “old” in the Peruvian language Quechua, and there are many other old, beautiful places to visit in the Sacred Valley, north of Cusco. Machu Colca is one of them. Also called Machuqolqa or Machu Qollqa, it is an easy-to-access place, with a hiking variation that makes it more adventurous. “Colca” derives from “qollca,” which is the Quechuan word for storage. Yes, quite literally, this site is an old storage facility, and it was used for food storage. You can see these early refrigerators in several places around the Sacred Valley. For instance, when you visit the Ollantaytambo Ruins, up on the hillside opposite those ruins is a qollca. It’s probably the best part of the view as you stand up in those ruins and look out. That old refrigerator, however, is difficult to access, requiring a lengthy hike. So Machu Colca is a nearby alternative about an hour from the more crowed Ollantaytambo. Accessed from the parking lot below, the 14 Incan terraces tower above and traditional water drainage pipes weave down among them. The water pipes made sure the potatoes, corn, wheat, and barley that were stored here didn’t get wet. These “refrigerators” were energy efficient—their cooling came from their location up on a hillside. Wind from the valley below sweeps up and keeps things cool. The stone structures—polished stone shows it was built in the Incan period—are also dazzling when viewed from above. They stand tall above the Urubamba River and a beautiful valley. As the breeze blows upward, you can imagine the thatched roofs and think about the incredible ways nature and humans used to collaborate on things like cooling, long before electricity.",
