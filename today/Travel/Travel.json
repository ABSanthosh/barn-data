There are a few cottages and cabins for rent, but a day visit (remember to leave on time) is enough to climb and walk around the 52-hectare island, enjoy the views and visit the spectacular cave with a painting of the crucifixion. There are chances of seeing dolphins and basking sharks, but we mainly saw masses of birds – good enough! There are obviously no shops/cafes, so bring everything you need (and … leave on time!).Asa Continue reading...",

That’s why, in 2013, I set myself a goal to travel to every country in the world. I grew up in Louisiana, and my family went on road trips across the US. When I was 13, I visited relatives in Texas and we went to a town in Mexico. It was so different from what I’d known.When I was a student, I didn’t travel a lot. But in my late 20s, I started working in revenue and merchandise for American Airlines and could get free flights if there were empty seats. Once, there were flights from Dallas to Caracas in Venezuela, so I went by myself to go scuba diving on some remote islands. Continue reading...",

    "description": "A U-boat bunker located in the Nyhavna port district in northern Trondheim, Norway, stands as a testament to the city’s wartime history. It was constructed during Nazi Germany’s occupation of Norway in World War II, when the city became the hub of the most important German Naval base in the Northern Atlantic. The bunker, with its colossal concrete walls, was one of two sister bunkers built at the site to shelter German submarines participating in the Battle of the Atlantic. In 1943, an American bomber fleet targeted the facility. Although the bunkers remained unharmed, the surrounding area was left in ruins. After the war, the Norwegian Navy took control of the facility, continuing to use Dora as a submarine base. However, as it became evident that the bunker was too massive for the needs of the Norwegian Navy, it was sold to private investors and repurposed for civilian use in the 1960s. Today, this massive structure safeguards a hidden treasure of cultural heritage. Its unique microclimate ensures stable temperature and relative humidity, making it ideal for long-term storage. As a result, several archives and collections from various cultural and museum institutions are housed within its walls. In addition to its archival functions, the bunker also accommodates offices and a bowling alley. Despite its apparent durability, Dora I faces challenges from the harsh Scandinavian climate and marine exposure, which have caused visible decay on its concrete surface, adding to its characteristic aura of history.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bones-in-jars",
    "description": "At first glance, Beaver Dam, Wisconsin seems like a place filled with quintessential small-town American charm. The town’s motto is “Life here is good,” and the most famous resident of Beaver Dam is the actor Fred MacMurray, star of such family-friendly fare as My Three Sons and Flubber. However, much like Fred MacMurray’s performance in Double Indemnity, a wholesome exterior can conceal darkness underneath. And in Beaver Dam, one local young artist is bringing gothic horror to his hometown through his storefront, Bones in Jars. The artist’s name is Wesley Kratz-Gullickson, and his goal with Bones in Jars is not only to provide himself with studio space, but to give people who felt like they didn’t fit in elsewhere the chance to feel safe. After graduating from University of Wisconsin-Superior, Wesley moved back to his hometown, and opened Bones in Jars in October 2023 right in the center of Beaver Dam’s downtown business district. The store primarily features Kratz-Gullickson’s work, which is a melange of the cute and mundane cut with the arcane and occult. Inspired by classic horror movies and Lovecraftian touches, the artist works in several media, such as cryptid-themed monster masks, jewelry made from bones (in jars), and dioramas with artistic displays of insects. A selection of the work is on display in the storefront itself, amidst antique and furniture stores. In addition to his own work, the store also includes displays from like minded guest artists, who as the store puts it, have “a flair for the odd and unique.” The goal is to provide a space for local artists so that their work can be displayed and sold closer to home. Kratz-Gullickson also offers classes in town for people who are interested in unusual crafts, such as bug pinning \u0026 display, bone jewelry, and owl pellet dissection and display. Although Bones in Jars would perhaps feel more at home in a larger city, Beaver Dam offers the affordable space and diverse set of shops that has allowed the store to fit in to the larger community, even with an offbeat selection. As for Kratz-Gullickson himself, he seems proud to have brought his vision onto Front Street. As he responded in an interview upon the store’s opening, “I really wanted to create a space where the weirdos could go that I wish we would have had when I was a teenager.”",
