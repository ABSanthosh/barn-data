    "description": "From cruising on a Scottish loch and sailing on the Broads to a ferry ride in the Alps and canoeing in France, our tipsters love messing about in boats• Tell us about a great art, music or writing holiday – the best tip wins a £200 holiday voucherHunter’s Yard in Ludham, Norfolk looks after a fleet of 1930s cabin yachts and day boats, some now with electric motors. Beautifully maintained and easy to sail, they provide a restful, beautiful holiday. I used to go on organised cruises in spring and summer as a teenager, then skippered boats for young people on the same cruises. Away from the obvious and popular spots, the Norfolk Broads remain wild and full of birds and animals. Go to your bunk early, with the sound of water, ducks and rigging. Get up early and sail past the sleeping gin palaces. Moor up early near a pub for your evening drinks. Hunters Yard staff are friendly and happy to advise; I’ll never forget the smell of wood and varnish in their workshops.Rupert Continue reading...",

    "description": "These ancient rocks have inspired myth and mysticism for millennia, and a new book and festival celebrate their enduring powerThe first bluebells are out along the Dart gorge, creating a faint purple haze under the twisted oak trees. I’m on my way to Luckey Tor, one of Dartmoor’s most hidden rock stacks, which sits by the river, shrouded in vegetation like Sleeping Beauty’s castle. It’s not the easiest of walks. The path peters out as I get deeper into the gorge, and the final approach to the tor involves clambering and hopping over large mossy boulders and navigating huge shelves of rock that border the river.The first sight of it is unforgettable. A small stream, the Row Brook, runs in front of it, like a moat. The tor looms up squarely from the valley floor, dwarfing everything around, framed in a grassy clearing that is a popular place to bivouac. Its position is unusual. Most tors are at the summit of a hill, dominating the views for miles around, standing grandly in the landscape, devoid of trees. Luckey Tor is sequestered in the folds of the Dart valley, and in the summer is mostly obscured by foliage; when you find it, you feel as though you’ve entered a secret kingdom. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Once off-limits to the public, this desert facility near Marana, Arizona now offers guided tours arranged through the airport. It used to be marked by a guardhouse with a ”Use of Deadly Force Authorized” sign; today, visitors can drive right up to the fence, and with a little planning, they can even explore the airpark’s contents up close. The site stores commercial aircraft for airlines and clients around the world, with an incredible range that is always changing. Additionally, several companies on the property paint, repair, and salvage aircraft. One section of the airpark holds very old aircraft, including a few 747s from airlines like TWA and, until recently, Pan Am. For those who schedule a tour, the experience can include a look inside a small building with photographs and memorabilia, as well as a drive around the facility with exceptional commentary.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hachiman-bridge",
    "description": "In November 1878, a new bridge was built over the Kaede River in Kyobashi Ward, based on the designs by American civil engineer Squire Whipple. Made mainly of iron (not steel, that is), it was the first Japanese bridge of its kind, and seen as an icon of westernization. Named Danjo Bridge after the nearby mansion of samurai lord Shimada Danjo, the bowstring truss bridge served as a significant point between the Imperial Palace, Honjo and Fukagawa areas. In 1912, a new Danjo Bridge replaced it and set it aside, and it went into disuse following the great Kanto earthquake of 1923. In May 1929, the old Danjo Bridge was relocated to the Fukagawa area, not far from the popular Tomioka Hachiman-gū shrine. It once crossed the Hachiman-bori canal, but it was later landfilled and turned into a pedestrian path. The bridge was also renamed Hachiman Bridge and preserved as a modest monument.",
