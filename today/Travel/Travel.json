    "description": "Language exchange holidays are wasted on the young. I had a great time with my host – sans youthful embarrassment about my accent – and more adults are doing the sameOn the terrace of a brasserie on Rue Cler, a chic Parisian market street, I’m chatting over a tongue-lubricating glass of Sancerre with Sébastien de Lavalette, 33, a French travel company head and my language exchange partner.Sébastien compliments my French accent, or at least I think he does: “You don’t have that mouth-full-of-bread accent that many British people have”, as I order in my middle-of-the-road restaurant French. Sébastien, who was raised in Paris but whose family hails from Périgord, reminisces about his teenage foreign language exchanges in Spain. Continue reading...",

    "description": "A trip that pairs partially sighted people with fully sighted guides offers reassurance while expanding the possibilities of travel, as our writer discovered in Austria and GermanySwimming through the cool clear lake, I’m aware of the densely forested mountains behind us, with pale rocky peaks to our right. A cable car snakes up the side of one, and the sky is turning grey, hinting at an Alpine storm. A standup paddleboarder with blond hair who is wearing bright Hawaiian shorts glides past, and the distant shore that we’re heading towards is clustered with cheery red parasols.I can’t really see much of this. I can see the silhouette of the mountains cradling us, the figure of the paddleboarder but not his twist of blond hair, and the cable car would otherwise be a mystery to me. But as I swim alongside a fellow traveller, Sophia, she describes the scene around us in such detail that it fills in the blanks and paints a rich picture for me as a visually impaired person.

    "description": "They get less fanfare and footfall than the UK’s famous long-distance paths, but trails such as this – which starts in Chester and saunters through the local countryside – are just as rewardingAt 8.45am, I stroll down the steps of The Queen at Chester hotel and into the midweek flow. The roads are full of delivery vans, the station is lined with taxis and the pavements are busy with commuters. I move among them lightly, a roamer bound for distant lands. Well, distant-ish: I’m a coffee to the good, it’s a warm day, and I’m about 20 strides into a 13-mile hiking trail. A pigeon coo-coos from a pub roof. And so the Baker Way begins.In the UK, you’re rarely far from a good walk. According to The Ramblers, there are more than 140,000 miles of footpaths, byways and bridleways in England and Wales alone. Some of these are well-used routes through classic beauty spots, but most go nowhere near a mountain ridge, a clifftop or even a national park. This makes them no less valuable. Continue reading...",

I set out to enjoy a quieter, more laid-back alternative farther north, where the overlooked city of Šibenik is the jumping-off point to a very different side of the Adriatic.First there’s Šibenik itself, which is still relatively devoid of the crowds you see in Croatia’s other coastal cities. Here you naturally gravitate towards the magnificent Unesco-listed St James Cathedral before checking out the cafe terraces on the Riva waterfront and the bars beside the fishing boats moored further up the quayside. Medieval St Michael’s Fortress and its 17th-century Venetian neighbours, St John’s and Barone, loom over the city, the latter two built to protect against Ottoman attacks. They have all been transformed into important cultural institutions – St Michael’s into an amphitheatre for concerts, St John’s an educational centre and cafe and Barone an open-air cinema with augmented-reality displays. Views of the city became even more impressive the higher I climbed to each fortress. Continue reading...",

There’s nothing quite like the thrill of digging through the racks and finding that elusive wishlist record. When I retired, I made it my mission to visit as many record shops as I could across the globe, from Amsterdam to Warsaw, via Berlin, Budapest, Madrid, Paris, Stockholm and Vienna and even as far as Australia and New Zealand.

    "description": "You don’t have to be a railway buff to enjoy the Station Agent’s House. The restored Georgian gem is a perfect base for exploring the historic Castlefield districtFor some, a stately home does it. For others, a converted barn. For me, anything rail-related hits the spot. It’s partly respect for transport and proper jobs. It’s also because I was born and raised 1.2 miles (or a mile and 16 chains in the parlance) south of the world’s first inter-city railway line – the Liverpool and Manchester, which opened on 15 September 1830. Though never a full-blown spotter, I got the transport bug watching 47s and Deltics rumbling along the tracks between St Helens Junction and Newton-le-Willows. Despite the delays and dysfunction that make rail travel so irksome today, I still love trains.It is then a childish buzz as well as a grown-up, heritage-inspired delight to be spending a couple of nights in the Station Agent’s House, the Landmark Trust’s new property in Castlefield, Manchester. The area, at the southern end of main drag Deansgate, is one of the city’s oldest, though its iron bridges and merchants’ warehouses are now overshadowed by high-rise apartment blocks.

Alongside the plump fruit and vegetables, drifts of cheese and butter paint the whole scene a deep cream, echoing the Provençal city’s warm limestone and light yellow plaster.Vincent van Gogh was drawn to yellow, which radiates from many of his best-known and best-loved paintings. The Yellow House was his home outside the city’s ramparts when he moved from Paris to Arles in 1888, hoping (and failing) to start an artists’ colony. It was a studio only in the summer, then furnished for living in the autumn. A new park nearby that he dubbed Poet’s Garden inspired pictures that burst with colourful and abundant growth.

Any night of the week, you can wander downtown and find live music playing somewhere – from the set of a live television show to a pop-up concert in a convenience store, not to mention incredible cuisine and nightlife where people never take themselves too seriously. We chatted with Madeline Hollern, editor of Austin Monthly, to get her latest favourite recommendations for visitors.Food and drinkThough Austin was always a great place for food trucks and burger joints, Hollern says she’s seen more options opening up from new restaurants in the city this year. “We’re getting more diversity in terms of types of food and price points, which is very welcome,” she says. One of her favourite new restaurants is Bambino, a pizza restaurant offering hand-tossed pies with a daily changing menu in East Austin. Far East Austin is where you’ll find some of the trendiest bars and restaurants in the city. Start your evening at Sign Bar (you’ll recognise it by the melange of neon), and then when you get hungry, head next door to Lao’d Bar. A newcomer on the Austin bar scene, Lao’d Bar represents a departure from the standard bar fare. “It has some of the best food I’ve had all year – it’s incredibly tasty Lao-inspired food, and it’s getting accolades left and right,” says Hollern.

    "description": "Our tipsters savour the season’s bounty, from orchard tours to pumpkin pickingOur family’s favourite place to visit in autumn is Tulleys Pumpkin Farm in West Sussex (its pumpkin festival runs until 31 October). The pumpkin fields are impressive, with an astonishing variety in all colours, shapes and sizes. The kids love exploring and picking out their favourites.

    "description": "Euphoria on a moped in Indonesia, orcas off Argentina and the chance to ranch, surf or simply be the person they always wanted to be are among our readers’ wonderful memoriesAfter a 10-year slog at work, my boss agreed to my taking a year-long sabbatical. We used this to revisit south-east Asia – not to relive past travelling glories of my 20s (where my destinations usually revolved around partying). Instead we floated around the more “cultured” parts that were not on my radar in days gone by – South Korea, Japan, Taiwan (a revelation) and more remote areas of the Philippines and Indonesia. I could list a hundred special moments and locations over the year – but the memory I revisit in my head the most is my daily moped drive to a beach on the Karimunjawa islands in Indonesia. It’s not the crystal-clear sea, smiling locals or amazing food that sticks, but the feeling of absolute freedom and euphoric joy that made me smile from ear to ear on that ride, sometimes laughing to myself hysterically for no reason (I must have looked a bit crazy). It’s joy that I felt from simply being alive. It’s a feeling that can be elusive in life and one I cherish so much. Benjamin Continue reading...",

Blessed with the most enticing and charming streets of a medieval old town that meanders upwards in car-free bliss, on the way have lunch at La Ciotola (Via S Stefano 4) where the ravioli is homemade and superb. San Remo has a brilliant market where you can buy anything from essential undies to bagfuls of chilli with the tongue-in-cheek claim that it is meglio del viagra (better than Viagra). Autumn is still warm and sunny and the best beach to try is Tre Ponti, which is where the locals go given that a lot of hotels in Italy bag the best places on the coast for their guests.

If you can, stay longer. We stayed three nights at Choo Choo Pension, on the island of Yeşilada (or Green Island), which is connected to the mainland by a causeway. It was incredibly tranquil in April. Eğirdir’s restaurants and shops are a short walk away and a few days spent relaxing by the lake were bliss.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-edward-state-park",
    "description": "Lake Washington occupies a north-south trending glacial basin just east of Seattle, and so tends to isolate the city. For this reason much of the shoreline along the east side remained undeveloped until well into the 20th century. \"Eastside\" development didn't really take off until the floating bridges, the I-90 bridge to the south and the Evergreen Point bridge to the north, were built across the lake in the mid-20th century. In 1926, long before the bridges, Bishop Edward John O'Dea purchased 366 acres on the northeast side of Lake Washington as a site for a seminary. Bishop O'Dea delivered the blessing of the cornerstone of St. Edward's Seminary on October 13, 1930, and the seminary was dedicated exactly a year later. St. Edward's enrollment grew through the early 1950s, but the changing priorities of the Catholic Church in the 1960s led to decreases in enrollment. St. Edward became a minor (i.e., high-school) seminary in 1968. Finally, in 1977 St. Edward and 316 acres of the site were sold to the state of Washington to be the basis of a state park, which was created in 1978. St. Edward State Park now preserves an almost unique snapshot of the undeveloped shoreline of Lake Washington. The park grounds are seamed with trails, some of which provide lakeshore access. The area is also, as might be expected, a haven for wildlife.  There are also still interpretive signs on the seminary and students' life there. In an incongruous development, the old seminary has been remodeled into a high-end hotel in the last few years.  Efforts were made to preserve as much of the structure as possible and have been largely successful. The common areas of the hotel, which include restaurants and a bar, are accessible to the public, and views can be had out some of the upper windows that open onto the public hallways. The first-floor hallways also hold art galleries, with some pieces for sale.",

    "description": "In 1870, the Montreal Mining Company sold their failed silver mine to the Silver Islet Mining Company, believing it wasn’t worth the hassle. The shafts extended down about 1,250 feet into Lake Superior, taking advantage of silver deposits in the bedrock along the way. But because the shafts dove into the lake, the mine workers constantly needed to run pumps to get rid of the water that flooded them day in and day out. The owner of the Montreal Mining Company made a big mistake that day. After Silver Islet Mining Company took over, the site became one of the most profitable silver mines in the world, producing roughly $3,250,000 of silver ore. The mine closed just 13 years after it opened, when a shipment of coal required to keep the pumps going never arrived and Lake Superior reclaimed the shafts. Those shafts are still there today, flooded by the lake and available to float over on a boat. It makes for a pretty spooky picture—a mine shaft descending deep into the depths of Lake Superior. Several shafts are visible, as well as the ruins of old mining buildings.",

The sea shells are of various size, from as small as a coin to cover the intervals to giant clams placed on prominent sections that looks like crowns from afar. This is a private residence but the fence can be appreciated from outside from the street level. Take the staircase on the left side of the gate in the direction of the statue to see the interior section of the fence and the giant clams placed on the top of the fence of towards the back of the house.",

    "description": "Tucked into the winding cobblestone streets of Nessebar’s old town, the ​​Church of St. Stephen is a gem of medieval Orthodox architecture. The first church on the site was built in the 11th century and dedicated to the Virgin Mary. However, most of what can be seen today dates back to the 16th century, when the church was enlarged and extensively renovated. But what makes St. Stephen truly remarkable is the church’s interior, covered in wall-to-wall medieval paintings. The interior contains 258 murals featuring more than 1,000 different New Testament figures. The oldest paintings show scenes from the life of the Holy Mother. Other murals depict miracles performed by Jesus and images of Judgement Day. After analyzing each mural’s painting style, archaeologists determined that three different artists painted the elaborate interior.  Also on view inside the church are St. Stephen’s original 18th-century carved wooden throne and pulpit. The church is exemplar of 11th century Byzantine architecture, featuring a typical three-nave basilica layout. Decorative brickwork adorns the exterior, along with capitals and cornices taken from earlier, abandoned buildings. In the 1990s, St. Stephen was in bad shape. But over the next decade emergency conservation work was completed at the church with help from the World Monuments Fund, waterproofing the church and restoring its numerous wall paintings. Today, St. Stephen is no longer an active place of worship but has been converted into a museum dedicated to perserving this unique religious site.",

    "description": "Chumphon, located near where the Malay Peninsula reaches its narrowest point, is also approximately where central Thailand starts to become southern Thailand. This can be heard in the local dialect, seen in the coastal, palm-studded landscape, and tasted in the local cuisine. And one of the most delicious places to witness this cultural shift is at Yay Puat. This second-generation, home-based restaurant serves a repertoire of dishes that blend the ingredients, dishes and flavors of Thailand’s central and southern regions. This means curries with fresh turmeric but with slightly fewer chilies and a bit less salt than those further south, lots of fish and seafood but also lots of protein from the land, and dishes that feature both coconut milk and a bit of palm sugar.  A great example of this is the dish that revolves around what is perhaps Chumphon’s most famous ingredient: kluay lep mue naang, “ladyfinger” bananas. At Yay Puad, they make their way into a southern Thai-style peppery, slightly spicy coconut milk curry based around pork ribs, the bananas providing a central Thai-leaning, almost sweet potato-like contrast.",

If you are into geology, then this is a must see when headed from Anchorage to either Denali National Park and/or up to Fairbanks. It is located just east of the town of Healy on an unassuming dirt road.   This is a visually stunning area with off shapes of water worn rock formations and numerous layers of bright colors including veins of coal. This area was once a major Alaskan coal mine which is now long closed in this location. Apparently, some people locally call this a well-kept secret. The name Suntrana comes from the Athabaskan (Native Alaskan) language meaning, “burning hills,” from fires coming from the coal seams.  This canyon hiker is a bit of an otherworldly experience where you start to feel like you may be on another planet or maybe gone back in time to when dinosaurs roamed the earth.",

    "description": "Located in the heart of Piran’s winding, Venetian streets, Trg 1 Maja would be easy to miss. Though its name invokes Slovenia’s communist past, Trg 1 Maja translates roughly to “First of May Square.” The name is perhaps a nod to the ancient Slovenian tradition of lighting bonfires on May 1st, a tradition sometimes associated with the pre-Christian holiday of Beltane. Long before the square was known as Trg 1 Maja, locals referred to it as Stari Trg (“the Old Square” in Slovenian) or Piazza Vecchia (“the Old Piazza” in Italian). It’s an apt name, as Trg 1 Maja is Piran’s oldest square and dates back to the Middle Ages.  In the 18th century, when Slovenia was under Hapsburg rule, an elaborate stone reservoir was built in the square. Gutters attached to houses and businesses around the square drained into the reservoir. That water would then get purified as it seeped through a layer of stone into a large fountain. Residents would then manually pump up the clean water. Today, the square and reservoir are remarkably unchanged. Two larger-than-life statues, representing Justice and Law, stand atop the reservoir, and carved putti and fish angle the still-intact 18th-century gutters into the historic fountain.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ilulissat-icefjord-center",
    "description": "The village of Ilulissat in West Greenland is known for the outstanding natural beauty of its icefjord. It's here that large icebergs break off from the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier after a journey of hundreds or even thousands of years from deep within Greenland's icecap. A moraine under the water causes many of them to get stuck just off Ilulissat's shore, creating a vast dreamscape for photographers. Sermeq Kujalleq is one of the fastest and most active glaciers on the planet. If you were to melt the annual ice mass that calves from it, there would be enough water to provide for the United States' yearly water consumption. Ilulissat’s icebergs have drifted as far as Bermuda, Ireland, and the Azores, and many believe it was an iceberg from Ilulissat Icefjord that led to the sinking of the Titanic.  Tourists to Greenland know to prioritize Ilulissat for its landscape, but may be unaware of its cultural history. At the mouth of the icefjord is an important archaeological site called Sermermiut where evidence of ancient Saqqaq, Dorset, and Thule cultures prove that Inuit have been passing through the region for more than 4,000 years. At the beautiful new Icefjord Center, a museum which opened in July 2021, visitors can learn more about the formation of icebergs and the significance of Sermermiut. An interactive screen shows where to look for earthworks, ruins, and graves, which will add context later when you're walking down the wooden boardwalk from the Icefjord Center, through Sermermiut, and all the way to the most popular viewpoint overlooking the icefjord. It's here that you'll arrive at Nakkaavik, \"the place where people fall.\" Legend says that elderly Inuit used to sacrifice themselves by jumping from the cliff at this location to make way for younger generations. Inside the Icefjord Center is also a unique virtual reality setup that brings you on an underground (or under-ice) tour of the EGRIP Polar Ice Station, where scientists are studying ice cores.",

    "description": "This home-bound, family-run stall in the southern Thai town of Pattani specializes in one dish and one dish only: nasi dagae. The dish, whose name means “trader’s rice” in the local Malay dialect, has its roots in Malaysia. It takes the form of rice served with a rich fish curry and sides, and although a handful of Muslim-influenced dishes have spread to various parts of Thailand, this is one that’s only available here, in the country’s Muslim-leaning deep south. The eponymous centerpiece here is three types of rice—long-grained white and red, and sticky rice—made rich and fragrant from coconut milk and aromatics such as ginger, shallots and fenugreek. This is paired with a pleasantly oily longfin tuna curry, and sides that include a mild, tender braised chili, a hard-boiled egg and a dollop of saman, minced shrimp simmered with coconut milk and palm sugar until nearly caramelized. The whole package is rich, slightly sweet, aromatic and utterly delicious.",

    "description": "The Industry, an eye-catching creation by sculptor Alex Chinneck, is a surreal artwork that appears to be a coiled canal boat floating tranquilly on the waters of the Sheffield and Tinsley Canal. The sculpture sits between locks 4 and 5 of the 19th-century waterway, which played a vital role in Sheffield's success during its industrial heyday.  The sculpture itself is decorated in the traditional style of canal boats, with its nameplate ornamented with a Tudor Rose, the hallmark of Sheffield-made silver and gold, in honour of the city's notable heritage of craftsmanship and metalworking. The Industry spans 13 meters (42 feet) in length and stands, with its signature loop, at a height of six meters (19 feet). The journey from the initial plan, to the design and construction of this sculpture spanned eight years. Before it was installed and unveiled in September 2024, the transportation of the sculpture in sections along the canal involved many extraordinary logistical feats. The endeavour involved negotiating approximately twenty locks and navigating around potential unexploded World War II bombs believed to be resting in the canal bed.",

    "title": "The Vanishing Hitchhiker Legend Is an Ancient Tale That Keeps Evolving",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/vanishing-hitchhiker-urban-legend",
    "description": "Drive through the Chicago suburb of Willow Springs late at night and local lore says you might see a forlorn young woman in a white dress on the side of the road. If you take pity and ask if she needs a ride, she’ll quietly accept. She’s soft-spoken and won’t say much, save that she’s headed your way. Then, a couple miles down the road, she’ll ask you to let her out—just as you pass the gates of the Resurrection Catholic Cemetery. You may well turn around, confused, to ask if this really is her stop, only to find that she’s vanished. Many Midwesterners likely know a version of this story; “Resurrection Mary” is one of the region’s most famous and enduring ghosts. But Mary is just one of the dozens of “vanishing hitchhikers” who supposedly haunt roads across the United States—and beyond. There’s the hitchhiking Los Angeles woman in white who asks to get out at a cemetery and then vanishes. Or the cackling flannel-clad redhead with hollow eyes who hitches in rural Massachusetts but vanishes in the backseat. Or the man looking for a lift on a lonely stretch of South Carolina road, only to vanish when the car passes the site of a ’50s prop plane crash. Vanishing hitchhiker legends are so ubiquitous that there’s an entire subfield of folklore research, going back more than 80 years, dedicated to tracking and unpacking them. What’s more, these tales are likely modern incarnations of much, much older legends. And they continue to spread and evolve. Accounts of Resurrection Mary and a handful of other vanishing hitchhikers started making the rounds in the 1930s. There was no compendium of these legends at the time, so as folklorists encountered one version, they treated it as a unique local tale, perhaps one born of the memory of a nasty early auto accident and anxieties about the proliferation of automobiles. Then, Richard K. Beardsley and Rosalie Hankey, students at the University of California, Berkeley, went digging. The pair searched for records of any car accident that could have inspired the version they’d heard. They came up empty—but they did discover similar yet distinctly local tales throughout the state. One of the people they interviewed, a businessman based in San Francisco, mentioned hearing of other versions in Chicago and Salt Lake City. Beardsley and Hankey reached out to contacts nationwide, and within two months they had a collection of nearly 80 distinct tales, from New York to Hawaii. They never found a clear Ur-story, the version from which all others evolved. But their research, published in 1942 in the inaugural issue of the journal California Folklore Quarterly, uncovered several curious aspects of the legend—and coined the term “the vanishing hitchhiker.” While each version of the story was hyperlocal, naming specific area roads, dance halls, and other landmarks, overall they could be broken into four broad categories: a hitchhiker who simply vanishes enroute to a given address; a young woman picked up at a social event who leaves behind a token, such as a coat or shawl; a wayfarer who predicts disaster before disappearing; or, unique to Hawaii, a hitcher turns out to be the goddess Pele, who goes on to reward people who offered her aid and punish those who ignored her. The two students also found parallels with much older European lore, including stories about spirits of those who died unexpectedly and were trying to make their way home. Almost by accident, Beardsley and Hankey had conducted the first systematic study of a modern legend. Their initial findings tantalized other scholars, who saw how documenting the “vanishing hitchhiker” could serve as a case study for a new approach to understanding how folktales evolve. The renowned folklorist Louis C. Jones became convinced that “if we could fathom the total history of this one story, its origins, its periods of quiescence and activity, its borrowings and lendings, its mutations and constants, its sensitivities to world events… we would have the answer to many of the riddles of our folk culture.” They trace back to ancient Roman tales of ghosts dispensing wisdom on roadways. In 1944, Jones confirmed the connection between vanishing hitchhikers and older European ghost lore, tracing them to stories of “ghost riders” brought to the U.S. by 19th-century immigrants. In these tales, spectral women leaped onto men’s horses as they rode to parties and then disappeared as they arrived. University of Birmingham folklorist Elizabeth Tucker adds that those early tales have since been traced back to medieval legends about wandering, vanishing saints, which may in turn echo ancient Roman tales of ghosts dispensing wisdom on roadways. While road names and other details vary, every legend in this lineage taps into an underlying concept: the liminality of roads. It’s easy to feel not just that we’re moving from point A to B, Tucker says, but maybe also between worlds, encountering unfamiliar and unexpected sights and strangers. Vanishing hitchhiker legends simply update this concept to reflect car-dominated roads—and the uniquely unnerving feeling of driving alone at night on empty roads. “Driving at night can be quite spooky,” says Hayley Stevens, who investigates paranormal phenomena from a science-based perspective. “A smaller field of vision… not knowing who is around … feeling tired towards the end of the day. [These are] all ingredients for a scenario in which something quite ordinary could be interpreted as something terrifying.” The legend evolves not only to reflect changes in how we travel, but to adapt to new cultures and concerns. In the ‘50s, Utah folklorist William A. Wilson recorded tales of prophetic hitchhikers who urged Mormon drivers to participate in a Church-backed food stockpiling program. And in the American South, the otherworldly hitchers took on characteristics of La Llorona, the famous weeping ghost of Mexican folklore. These stories—like all ghost lore—convey a subtle morality lesson, say the folklorists who study them. But the moral of vanishing hitchhiker legends also seems to shift as it spreads across time and cultures. Many Hawaiian versions emphasize the importance of aiding those in need, for example. But that flannel-clad man in rural Massachusetts, who sits cackling behind the driver, growing louder and more maniacal until he vanishes, reminds listeners of the dangers of trusting strangers too easily. Researchers have found that ghost lore seems to endure when it’s connected to something familiar and concrete: a known figure or landmark, a verifiable tragedy or death. A story about a particular stretch of road, for instance, invites people to recount, embellish, and thus perpetuate it whenever they hit that treacherous turn. And while it’s often hard to verify the alleged death referenced in a hitchhiker tale, car crashes and other accidents are not that uncommon. Being able to find at least a plausible connection to one of those real-life tragedies—a young woman who died in circumstances similar to those of Resurrection Mary, for example—makes the legend seem more authentic. Ghost lore seems to endure when it’s connected to something familiar. But the most fascinating aspect of the vanishing hitchhiker for many researchers is its truly global adaptability. In the mid-1950s, on the heels of the Korean War, a variant of the tale appeared in South Korea, which did not have a strong car culture at the time. Soon after, versions popped up in East Africa, which had little cultural connection to the urban legends of the U.S. In the 21st century, folklorists have documented the legend popping up in Romania, China, northeastern India, and even relatively isolated Bhutan. While the globalization of American pop culture may explain some of the legend’s international spread, it tends to find purchase only in cultures that already have some tradition of ghost lore. The legend also typically takes hold in a society going through a period of social change and uncertainty. Folklorist Margaret Lyngdoh of Estonia’s University of Tartu found that the vanishing hitchhiker tale spread in the Indian city of Shillong alongside rapid urbanization. There, she says, highways and traffic became focal points for broad anxieties about changes in social structures, cultural norms, and senses of safety—just as they were in 1930s America. There’s one difference, however: Shillong has no history of hitchhiking, so the legend evolved there to be about cab drivers picking up supernatural passengers. In 2021, professional skeptic Deborah Hyde wrote that vanishing hitchhikers might be on the decline. Hitchhiking is far less common than it once was. Safer roads and vehicles, and greater connectivity, have made driving at night less of a journey into the liminal. Some folklorists haven’t identified new iterations of the old legends for years, at least in the U.S. But there’s another reason the legend may be fading here: It’s simply too well known. Since the 1940s, the vanishing hitchhiker legend has turned up in radio plays, tv shows—including its own Twilight Zone episode—indie horror movies, reality shows, and even video games. The motif’s ubiquity makes the actual stories, even when told over a campfire or whispered on a late-night road trip, seem contrived. However, some folklorists, including Lyngdoh and Tucker, believe the legend is far too flexible to fade away. Even in the U.S., where the vanishing hitchhiker is almost a cliche, Tucker believes there’s still deep fascination with eerie, empty roads and the supposed potential for paranormal encounters on them. There’s also a hunger for frameworks to contextualize unnerving experiences that many of us have had. And there’s more willingness to talk openly about those experiences. In fact, Tucker says she’s noticed fewer secondhand and more purported firsthand accounts of roadside ghost encounters recently—though they’re often just about specters standing on the shoulder of a highway and then vanishing, rather than picking up any young women in white. Tucker adds that these newer stories can be found on social media and YouTube rather than in a local newspaper or bar chatter. As we live more and more online, our ghosts do, too.",

    "title": "Death as a Dog: The Cù Sith of Scotland",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/cu-sith-scottish-folklore-black-dog",
    "description": "On his walk home on the Scottish island of Tiree, a man came across a huge dog, its paw as big as the spread of his palm, near the hill of Kenavara. The black dog was resting on a sandbank near the shore, its thick fur wet with saltwater. The man hesitated, unsettled by the animal’s appearance, and decided to follow another path home. The next day, he retraced his steps, determined to find it. But when he returned to the spot, he saw only the dog’s paw prints. He followed its trail onto the wind-whipped grassland until the prints disappeared. Although he was disappointed, he was grateful the dog had not spotted him the day before, because he was sure it was something otherworldly. That terrifying tale, from a compendium of 19th-century Scottish folktales written by John Gregorson Campbell, is but one of many references in the British Isles to death appearing as a dog. Scholars believe dogs appearing as omens of death, and also as minions of the devil, evolved in the islands’ early Christian era. But these tales grew out of much older stories that linked large dogs to fairies and other supernatural beings who appear in ancient, pagan traditions across Europe but particularly in Scotland and Ireland. In his book, Campbell identifies the dog spotted near Kenavara as Scotland’s feared Cù Sìth, one regional variation of the ominous black dog. The animal shows up in Ireland as the Cù Sidhe, while the Cwn Annwn roam Wales and the Gabriel Ratchets, sometimes called Gabble Ratchets, can be found in Northern England (ratchets were a type of hound). The dog’s Gaelic names specifically tie it to fairies, or fae. “Cù” means hound and “Síth” or “Sidhe” is the word for both fae and the mounds where they lived. While they were often black, Cù Sìth sometimes appeared to be green, a color “generally connected with bad fortune and also the color most commonly associated with the fae, magic, and the supernatural,” says Mark Norman, author of Black Dog Folklore. The dogs were sometimes described as being owned or employed by the fairies, and used to kidnap humans to serve the fae, Norman adds. In some folktales, the Cù Sìth spent much of their time around the ring forts, sometimes called fairy forts, found throughout Scotland and Ireland, as well as hills and mountains. For instance, there are numerous accounts of ghostly black dogs wandering the slopes of the Scottish mountain Schiehallion, also known as Sìdh Chailleann, the Fairy Hill. As Christianity spread across the British Isles beginning in the sixth century, the fae and their hounds did not fit into its rigid framework of good and evil. Under the influence of the Church, the Cù Sìth became one of many animals said to be either a minion of the devil or Satan himself in disguise. Likewise, the mounds and ring forts where it was commonly seen became associated with gateways to the subterranean Christian hell, says Jenny Butler, a lecturer on folk religious traditions at the University College Cork. Soon there were sightings around graveyards as well as fairy circles. As the Christian belief system mingled with older traditions across the British Isles, several of the regional black dog traditions, including Cù Sith, became associated specifically with the Wild Hunt, a deeply ancient myth. Variations are found across Central and Northern Europe, but the tradition describes otherworldly hunters racing across a stormy sky, often in pursuit of human souls. The Cù Sith and other black dogs accompanied the hunters in some tellings of the tale. Over time, says Norman, the dogs were seen as a guide “conveying souls of the departed to the afterlife.” Soon there were sightings around graveyards as well as fairy circles. “There are stories of the black dog emerging out of the grave, or jumping up off of the coffin, or following people from the graveyard,” says Butler. The black dog was eventually seen as death itself, or at least a terrible omen of it. Perhaps not surprisingly, folktales warn that when a person outside hears the first howl of the Cù Sìth, they should run indoors. Hearing three howls or barks could cause the listener to die from fright. So tonight, especially if the storm clouds roll in, listen for the howl of a dog carried on the chill night air. Whether you believe it is death itself, an ancient evil, or just an animal announcing itself to the world, know that you are hearing the same sound that struck fear into your ancestors. And, well, best stay indoors till morning.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/hurricane-milton-helene-disaster-response",
    "description": "Last week, Hurricane Helene carved a devastating path through 500 miles of the southeastern United States. Unlike the average hurricane or tropical storm, Helene’s worst damage was in inland mountain communities in Appalachia, where it washed away roads, bridges, and, in at least one case, an entire town. As Hurricane Milton prepares to make landfall in central Florida it brings with it what may be the worst storm surge in a century to areas that are still cleaning up debris from the last storm. In the face of this apocalyptic-seeming destruction, stories have emerged of people coming together to support each other, rebuild what was lost, and understand the forces driving these immense, deadly phenomena. Community Responses Amid the heartbreak and destruction, incredible stories have emerged of communities banding together to deliver supplies, raise funds, and rescue both humans and animals. In Asheville, where fallen trees and debris have rendered areas inaccessible by car, mules are transporting much-needed canned food and medicine. In Tampa Bay, rescuers are saving manatees left stranded by receding floodwaters. And in Charlotte, ham radio operators have stepped in to provide emergency broadcasts and welfare checks amid cellular and internet outages. From saving a twice-displaced turtle to hikers rallying support for damaged trails, here are a few of our favorite stories highlighting the helpers. —Sam O'Brien, Gastro Obscura Senior Editor Hurricane Helene Battered North Carolina's Mountain Trails. Now, Mules Are Vital for Delivering Supplies.Asheville Citizen Times Forget Cell Phones—Amateur Radio Shines in the Wake of HeleneWCNC Charlotte On Airport Runways and in Cemeteries, Rescuers Are Helping Manatees Stranded by Hurricane HeleneGarden \u0026 Gun Appalachian Trail Hikers Rally Support as Trail Towns Recover From Hurricane HeleneOutside Florida Zoo Evacuates Animals Ahead of Hurricane MiltonNewsweek Why This Is Happening As communities from Cuba to Appalachia grapple with the aftermath of Helene, Hurricane Milton looms. On Monday, the hurricane became one of the most powerful ever documented. While its wind speeds decreased briefly on Tuesday, it regained Category 5 strength as it approached Florida’s Gulf Coast, including areas still reeling from Helene. Milton continues to be “an extremely dangerous storm,” according to the National Hurricane Center, but it’s not an act of God—or a big shock to climate scientists. As detailed in Vox, Milton exploded in size and ferocity thanks to extremely warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico. According to the Atlantic, other media outlets, and most climate scientists, climate change is the main cause of the Gulf heating up and fueling increasingly intense—and more frequent—hurricanes. Veteran Florida meteorologist John Morales was visibly emotional on a live TV segment discussing Milton’s strength and path, later explaining to Mother Jones that he was experiencing a mixture of anxiety and worry for those in harm’s way and frustration over lack of action on the climate crisis. Milton’s track is particularly worrisome. The greater Tampa area’s geography and recent development boom make it especially susceptible to catastrophic damage from storm surge, as explained in Slate. As millions of Americans face the daunting task of surviving the storms and their aftermath, there is another tempest churning online: a dangerous explosion of conspiracy theories that are, in many cases, disrupting relief efforts and putting lives at risk. With the U.S. presidential election less than a month away, politicians, pundits, and even pranksters are pushing false narratives about the storms and the government’s response, as detailed in Grist. The Federal Emergency Response Agency has been so overwhelmed by the disinformation, according to NPR, that it has set up a response page aimed at debunking many of the baseless claims. That response page requires time and resources that could have gone toward actual disaster relief work at a time when FEMA is critically understaffed and underfunded. As Mother Jones reported on Monday, the agency needs some relief of its own—but it appears unlikely that Congress will meet to consider approving much-needed funding until after the November 5 election. Atlas Obscura is proud to be a part of the Climate Desk collaboration, along with Mother Jones, Grist, and many of the other outlets mentioned above. We encourage you to stay up to date on their coverage as this fluid situation continues to evolve. —Gemma Tarlach, Senior Editor and Writer How to Think About Tourism In the wake of Hurricane Helene, and with Hurricane Milton bearing down, many travelers are likely reconsidering their plans to visit the Southeast in the near future. After all, planning a vacation to a region affected by political upheaval or natural disaster can seem both unwise and insensitive. However, as Jen Murphy writes in this article from Outside, places that rely on the tourism industry are often hit with a one-two punch: first, a disaster strikes, and then visitors stop coming, “often when local communities need tourism dollars most.” Murphy urges travelers to thoughtfully consider how their presence—and their tourism dollars—might impact both affected and unaffected areas, and to reach out to locals for their insights on visiting. —Anne Ewbank, Gastro Obscura Senior Associate Editor",

    "title": "The Return of 'The Squadron Bottle,' a San Francisco Tradition",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/fleet-week-san-francisco-tradition",
    "description": "The InterContinental Mark Hopkins San Francisco has perched at the top of Nob Hill for nearly a century. When it opened in 1926, it was more simply called the Hotel Mark Hopkins, named after the railroad executive that once built a home there. The luxury hotel has hosted presidents, premiers, and all kinds of celebrities. But one famous group of visitors didn’t visit the hotel to stay in a suite. Throughout World War II, military personnel flocked there to take the elevator to the Top o’ the Mark, a bar on its 19th floor. The Top o’ the Mark (or the Top of the Mark, as it’s usually written these days) was converted from a penthouse into what famous San Francisco journalist Herb Caen called “a glass-enclosed saloon” in 1939. People didn’t always head there for the drinks, he added. “The famed cocktail bar floats approximately fifty stories above sea level, and the view is so staggering (fifty miles in every direction) that alcoholic beverages seem superfluous.” To the military personnel visiting during World War II, though, alcohol was not superfluous. The bar, with its lofty view of the ocean, became a symbolic place to drink before shipping out to the Pacific Theater. Life magazine published a story on the phenomenon in July 1944, noting how the bar’s clientele had turned over entirely. Once, it was “the exclusive night spot of San Francisco.” Instead, the journalist wrote, it was \"patronized by beribboned servicemen,” and “democratically crowded to the walls.” Crowded was an understatement. On busy nights, servicemen would wait hours in the hotel lobby to take the elevators up to the Top of the Mark. Some months would see as many as 30,000 military visitors to the hotel bar, where an unusual tradition sprang forth. “One day, it's rumored that an officer from a squadron bought a bottle of bourbon, wrote a note on it, attached it to the bottle, and left it with the bartender,” explains Connie Perez-Wong, creative director at the hotel. Any member of the squadron who came in could have a shot from the bottle. “The only caveat was that whoever had the last shot would need to buy the next bottle,” Perez-Wong says. Servicemen who passed through San Francisco often promised to meet each other again at the Top of the Mark, and many did, making it a meaningful place of reunion and remembrance for those who didn’t return from the war. But eventually, Perez-Wong says, the custom stopped. “I don't know if it was actually stopped or it just died off,” she says. But the story “passed down through the different teams at the hotel.” Then, in 2009, came the revival. According to Perez-Wong, a cadet named Lieutenant Mike Hall, who’d just graduated from Annapolis, came to the bar. “And at the time, the manager of the room knew about this tradition, and he told young Lieutenant Hall,” Perez-Wong says. “And Lieutenant Hall said, ‘By golly, we’ve got to get it restarted.’” Lieutenant Hall bought a bottle and left it behind the bar. In the following years, the collection exploded. Today, guests stepping off the elevator into the Top of the Mark will be greeted by dozens of bottles, some in display cases, some on carts, all covered in notes and surrounded by photographs, badges, patches, and pins. Some notes contain well-wishes for those in active service, while others memorialize those who never came home. “We also have logbooks for anybody that wants to leave a story or leave a dedication,” says Perez-Wong. Today, there’s about 80 bottles in the collection. Some of them will likely be gone soon, since it’s currently Fleet Week, when San Francisco welcomes Navy, Marine, and Coast Guard ships. Civilians can tour ships, listen to military bands, and watch an air show by the Blue Angels. The air show alone usually draws a million people to the city. Perez-Wong says the bar hosts an influx of guests during Fleet Week, as well. Some of them might even buy a bottle to leave behind. Anyone can leave a bottle, and you don’t need to be part of a specific squadron to have a drink, either. “If you present a military ID, you can choose whichever bottle that you want to drink from, basically,” says Perez-Wong. As for what there is to drink, “the story is that it started with a bottle of bourbon,” she says. “So the majority would be either whiskey or bourbon, but we've had purchases of vodka [and] gin. It runs the gamut now.”",

    "description": "It’s considered a miracle, an engineering marvel, and even a scientific anomaly, depending who you ask. In Santa Fe, New Mexico, the helix-shaped spiral staircase at Loretto Chapel has long puzzled visitors, including architects and physicists. There are several unknowns surrounding the staircase and its late-19th-century origins. First off: how was the 20-foot structure, which includes two 360-degree turns, built without the use of nails or other support? And how has it never wavered, despite so much use, after all these years? Also unknown is the type of wood used to build the staircase, and who built it in the first place. Neither the carpenter nor their materials have ever been identified. Over the years, multiple historians—and, more recently, internet sleuths—have scoured historical records and other sources in various attempts to solve the mystery, with little agreement between them. There are numerous conflicting theories, and the staircase’s construction has been scrutinized in several books and even an episode of Unsolved Mysteries. Today, roughly 250,000 visitors marvel at the chapel and its mystifyingly unsupported spirals each year. For some, the ongoing mystery is an answer in itself. According to chapel curator Richard Lindsley, these absences of information can only lead to one explanation: a divine miracle. “People from all different fields—from faith, from science—have gravitated to it, but no one has given me truly convincing evidence,” says Lindsley, who’s been employed by the chapel for over 30 years. “And that’s why I choose to believe that prayers to St. Joseph were deeply involved.” Once upon a time in New Mexico In 1872, the Sisters of Loretto, a Catholic religious order that originated in Kentucky, commissioned a chapel to be built for their girls’ school in Santa Fe. The blueprint came from prominent French architect Antoine Mouly’s son, Projectus. The chapel would serve as a side project while he worked on the nearby Saint Francis Cathedral with his father. After five years of construction, the Loretto Chapel was consecrated in 1878 as an impressive Gothic Revival building based on the famous Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. With spirals and buttresses constructed from locally quarried sandstone, plus stained glass windows imported from France via the Santa Fe Trail, the chapel was considered a masterpiece—that is, until everyone realized that Projectus Mouly’s plans did not include access to the chapel's choir loft. Unfortunately, by that time, Mouly had met his untimely death in a shooting; his father had returned to France. The nuns called in a team of carpenters, who after a period of deliberation decided that this problem could never be solved. A staircase would not only detract from the chapel’s grand design, they said; it would also be impossible to build in such a small space. The only feasible way to reach the loft would be by ladder, which the nuns refused as being too inappropriate and hazardous to climb in their habits. Without alternatives, the sisters turned to what they knew best: prayer. During a novena (nine days’ of consecutive prayer to a specific saint or intention), they asked St. Joseph, the patron saint of carpenters, for an answer. Allegedly, on the ninth day, a mysterious, shabby-looking man arrived with a donkey and a toolbox, offering his services. Over the next few months, he made the staircase for the chapel, requesting only complete privacy and several tubs of hot water for the duration. When it was finished, he left suddenly without taking payment. Of course, the sisters were flummoxed to see the result: a sleek, beautiful staircase comprising 33 steps—33 being the age at which Jesus was crucified—held together with only wooden pegs, no nails. Even more incredulously? The wood it was made of certainly did not come from New Mexico. After searching for the man, and never finding him, they concluded that the Loretto Chapel’s staircase must have been built by St. Joseph himself. Searching for the carpenter’s identity To this day, no one knows who built the staircase. Whoever he was, decades of experts have confirmed that he must have been a woodworking master to create a staircase comprising two tightly coiled 360-degree turns free of centering support. According to Reba Weatherford, an archivist at the Loretto Heritage Center in Kentucky, dozens of people have written to the order over the years claiming that a relative of theirs had been the unknown man. One writes: “My grandfather J.H. Rogers disappeared from Omaha, Nebraska in 1881 … When he arrived in Santa Fe, he heard about the need for the stairway and he decided to build the stairway as an atonement for his sins of drinking. That could be the reason for not staying around after it was built to receive any money.” This letter is just one story of many. “In the 1950s and 1960s, there were a lot of these,” Weatherford says. The most popular theory about the carpenter’s identity has come from Santa Fe historian Mary J. Straw Cook in her 1984 book Loretto: The Sisters and Their Santa Fe Chapel. She posits that the builder was François-Jean “Frenchy” Rochas, citing a 1895 newspaper article about the murder of the reclusive rancher. The article described Rochas as “an expert worker in wood”, and claimed he was the man behind the Loretto Chapel staircase. Cook backed up her claim with an 1881 logbook memo for an $150 check “[p]aid for wood — Mr. Rochas for N. School.” Many familiar with the staircase mystery aren’t satisfied with this theory, however, as the payment was three years after the staircase’s supposed completion and, at that time, the sisters had indeed also commissioned the building of a nearby school. Loretto archivist Weatherford adds, “The [newspaper] clipping has been referenced a lot, that’s for sure. But it does not exist in our records, I don’t know where it exists.” Unfortunately, many such historical records pertaining to the staircase have been hard to find. Some were lost over the years, in the moving of archival records between convents, or burned in several fires that destroyed the schools and convent buildings throughout New Mexico missions in the late 19th and early-to-mid 20th centuries. A structure defying physics, even today The staircase’s design was ingenious for its era, even more so considering how it was made to stay up using only basic hand tools and no electricity. Over the years, the staircase also endured regular use (a 1959 archival photo shows a 20-strong womens’ choir assembled on its steps), though these days, its access is firmly closed to the public. Lindsley, the curator, says he’s spoken to architects who can’t explain the staircase’s durability. “Every carpenter I’ve ever met has been amazed,” Lindsley says. He recalls many stories of scientists and tradespeople visiting the chapel, like the staircase builder from Arizona who once spent eight hours intensely inspecting the staircase. “I was impressed by his wife, who was there and waiting for him [the whole time],” he laughs. A puzzling detail exists, though. Despite being such a master craftsman, the staircase’s builder did leave out one thing: a hand railing to keep the steps from shaking when stepped on. (The twisted stairs, like a giant spring, were known to have a serious bounce.) After a decade, a railing was added, when supposedly the nuns grew tired of crawling down on their hands and knees to prevent tripping. Indeed, it’s strange that a narrow spiral staircase, intended for nuns in traditional robes, wouldn’t come with hand support in the first place. The wood’s unknown origins Experts have determined that the staircase is made of spruce wood, but it’s unclear where the wood came from. It certainly did not come from local lumber yards. Recently, the wood’s inconclusive origins have become what many consider to be an absolute indication that Loretto Chapel’s staircase was a divine act. In 1996, Forrest N. Easley, a retired forester and wood technologist for the U.S. Forest Service, also formerly of the U.S Navy Research and Development Laboratory, studied the staircase over 15 months. He concluded in a study that no spruce existed in the world exactly like it, even suggesting that the wood was so unique that it should be named “Loretto Spruce”. The staircase’s legacy The Loretto Chapel was actively used every day by the students and nuns of the Loretto Academy girls’ school until it closed in 1968. Today, it functions as a privately owned museum, visited by everyone from Catholic pilgrims to school groups; it’s also a popular wedding venue. The Loretto Heritage Center archives highlight the staircase mystery’s impact over the years. This impact can be seen in a film made about the staircase, as well as songs, a comic book, and a children’s book, which archivist Reba Weatherford has blogged about. Each year, she says, the center receives a handful of information requests from curious documentarians and filmmakers. She says the sisters are too busy focusing on the Loretto community’s mission to \"work for justice and act for peace” to pay much attention to the staircase’s fame. Instead they simply enjoy the miracle and mystery. “It’s interesting to have this instance of religious history colliding with pop culture,” she explains. “Especially from an archival perspective, it’s fun since the bulk of what we get are genealogy requests.” Even after 30 years as curator, Richard Lindsley continues to welcome anyone to try to change his mind that the Loretto Chapel’s staircase is anything but a miracle. “I’m always asked my opinion and I have to believe [it’s a miracle],” he says. “And I’ll find out the details on the other side.",

    "title": "Inside the Weird World of Corn Mazes",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/corn-maze-design-and-history",
    "description": "It was a sunny autumn day in Danvers, Massachusetts on Oct. 10, 2011—perfect for some fall fun. Taking advantage of the good weather, a family of four ventured into a headless horseman-themed corn maze at Connors Farm. Things quickly unraveled. As the sun set and the maze closed for the evening, members of the family, which included a five-year-old child and three-week-old baby, realized getting lost wasn’t as amusing as they thought. Eventually, they called the police department, desperate for a way out. \"We thought this would be fun,” the woman said on the phone with the police, according to a NBC News story about the misadventure. “Instead, it's a nightmare. I don't know what made us do this.” Though stressed, the family was never in any real danger. The maze staff were still on site, waiting for them to finish, and would have gone in to find them if needed. And the family simply could have walked through the corn “walls” to the field edge at any time. But panicked parents and kids aren’t that unusual. Anxious corn maze calls to 911 happen more often than you might think. At Cool Patch Pumpkins in Dixon, California, emergency calls from deep inside their massive, 60-acre corn maze, one of the world’s largest, are an annual occurrence. Mazes are supposed to be fun—even the getting lost part, says Brett Herbst, who has been designing mazes in Utah and across the country since 1996. Herbst says there’s an art to making a maze: It must be engaging but not so tricky that people quit. “If you make it too challenging, you lose some people,” he says. While some visitors call the cops when they can’t find their way out, the bigger risk is people getting frustrated and cheating, he adds. People have been experiencing the twists and turns of mazes for millennia, as architectural defenses intended to slow and confuse the enemy, for walking meditations, and yes, as entertainment. Hedge mazes, with dense greenery that towered over players, became popular with European aristocrats in the 17th century, heralding the future fun of the corn maze. The modern corn maze—in which visitors are usually tasked with finding an exit or solving a variety of challenges—is a fairly recent invention, created only in 1993. Don Frantz, a creative director who had worked on Broadway and the Super Bowl’s halftime show, thought of the idea while admiring cornfields from an airplane. He recruited British designer Adrian Fisher to carve a dinosaur named Cornelius the Cobasaurus into a three-acre Pennsylvania field. Workers pulled stalks by hand to create the design. The attraction, dubbed “The Amazing Maize Maze,” quickly garnered media attention and inspired farmers around the country to create their own versions. For example, Herbst runs a company—The Maize—that not only crafts an annual maze in Utah, but also helps hundreds of other farms do the same. While mazes have become more intricate, a lot remains the same from those early days, Herbst says. Corn is typically planted in a grid system, which makes it easy to map out designs using software such as Adobe Illustrator. Then comes the tricky part—actually cutting the maze out. Herbst remembers making his first corn maze using a weed wacker with a saw blade attachment. For the ideal maze, you want to cut the path when the corn is somewhat grown—about three feet high—but not so tall that falling stalks risk knocking down their neighbors, which creates jagged lines, says maze manager David Wissemann. He and his wife create designs for the family company and farm, Mike’s Maze, in Massachusetts. The Wissemanns’ work focuses more on intricate patterns than dead ends. Instead of hoping to get visitors lost, the team builds in games and other sidequests. Wissemann remembers his father, Mike, and landscape designer Will Sillin using a four-wheeler with a GPS unit to carve out their first design in 2000. It worked, but they knew they could do better. The following year, Sillin decided to preserve the fine details of the design by going into the maze with a hoe and weed whacker, taking weeks to clear the path by hand. Now, they bring in Rob Stillford from Missouri, who has a GPS mounted on a Bobcat skid steer that can get the job done in one day. Hiring someone six states away to haul his equipment in for a day job might seem like an expensive choice, but the profits from a corn maze can bring in far more money than the crop itself. “I joke that we get more of our ‘harvest’ in September and October than we do when we go through with the combine in November,” says Wissemann. And Corn mazes are as popular as ever, according to Herbst. In areas hit by drought, however, some farms have had to think outside the box. In 2022, At’l Do Farms outside of Lubbock, Texas, used a mix of sorghum, sunflowers, pearl and foxtail millet, cowpeas, sun hemp, and radishes to create their maze. Herbst and some other farmers have also opted to complement their corn mazes with versions made of sunflowers. The key element, he says, is that you can’t see over or through them too easily. While some 911 callers might disagree, “Getting lost is a lot more fun than what you'd initially think,” says Herbst.",

    "description": "This article is adapted from the October 5, 2024, edition of Gastro Obscura’s Favorite Things newsletter. You can sign up here. Where I live in California, it’s been an unseasonably warm fall. While cafés and grocery stores are going full-speed ahead with all things autumn, no one I know is running to get a pumpkin spice latte yet, considering the 100-degree plus temperatures. Instead, we’re all still craving anything cold and iced. The other day, I saw my first at-home pebble ice machine, and I was filled with a brief longing to buy one for myself so that I could enjoy textured, crunchy ice whenever I wanted. Alas, all of my ice comes from plastic trays in the freezer. But I’m fascinated by the growing number of people who treat ice as an art. Instead of cloudy, rectangular cubes, some bartenders hand-carve sparkling frozen forms out of perfectly clear ice. Others use special molds, edible flowers, juices, and fruit to create ice that adds flavor and texture to a drink, as well as cooling it down. Focusing so much effort on ephemeral ice might seem impractical. Yet people often fixate on the perfect liquors, the perfect glassware, and the perfect drink-making technique. Ice is an essential part of many beverages, so this week, we’re finding out more about this fascinating frozen art. Cool History Before refrigeration, ice was a flex. Around the world, there are records of the wealthy and powerful sending their servants up high mountains to bring back snow for drinks and desserts. Even those without convenient snowy mountains nearby could enjoy cold treats on hot days by constructing insulated buildings and stocking them with winter ice cut from bodies of water nearby. But this depended on having a cold enough climate during the winter. In the 19th century, fast ships and railroads could carry ice around the world. The United States began shipping ice from its lakes to far-flung locales like the Caribbean and England. But Americans kept plenty of that ice for themselves, adding it to trendy new mixed drinks called cocktails. In the 20th century, home freezers made ice more accessible than ever before. But, until recently, people have stuck to cloudy white cubes to cool down their drinks. Ice Gets Hot Over the past few years, I’ve seen “ice restock” videos appear across my social media feeds. These consist of influencers showing off floppy silicone ice molds filled with colorful frozen liquids and fruits, and the process of popping out aesthetically-pleasing ice into freezer drawers. Comments range from admiring to skeptical, but there’s no denying that the sounds of ice cubes (there’s often an #asmr tag) and the colors of the ice are appealing. Creations like pink, cherry blossom–shaped ice and ice frozen into rose shapes and sprinkled with dried petals almost seem too pretty to submerge in a drink. Of similar interest are videos of bartenders, especially from Japan, painstakingly carving clear ice into spheres or diamonds. But why would a bartender want to take time out from a shift to hand-carve a piece of ice? There’s numerous explanations: certain shapes, such as spheres, melt slower and dilute a drink less, and a good number of small Japanese bars buy their ice in huge chunks that need to be broken down anyway. The Quest for Clear Ice These factoids come from Camper English, the author of The Ice Book: Cool Cubes, Clear Spheres, and Other Chill Cocktail Crafts. Over the last 15 years, English has made a name for himself as the internet’s ice guru, a reputation established by a long-ago quest to create clear ice at home. It all started with a bit of mythbusting, he explains. He attended a cocktail conference where a panel touched on the subject of making clear ice. “So I decided to test the theories that people were suggesting, methodically, at home,” he says. For example, many people think that freezing boiling water will result in clear ice. English tried it. It didn’t work. “It's more of an urban legend than anything else,” he says. So he set out to develop a standardized process. In his book, English describes freezing different kinds of water in different containers, but all his ice ended up cloudy-white in the center. It took a lot of ice and observation before he noticed that the outer edges of his ice cubes stayed clear. On December 28, 2009, he posted this finding: freezing water in an insulated container without a top would result in a piece of clear ice with a cloudy layer at the bottom that could be chipped off. This, he explains to me over the phone, is known as directional freezing. The last part of water to freeze will end up cloudy from trapped air and impurities. Usually, that’s the very center of an ice cube, but using an insulated container without a lid “only freezes from one direction, which is the top down towards the bottom,” he says. You can also get see-through ice from not allowing a cube to freeze solid, keeping the center liquid. Both home and professional bartenders absorbed English’s findings, and there’s now an industry creating tools to make ever-more fanciful clear ice at home. “I'm glad that it's still going all these years later,” says English. He hasn’t gotten tired of ice, either. “I have fun with my reputation as an ice weirdo,” he says. “I rarely keep food in my freezer if I can avoid it because I've always got a few ice projects happening in there.” “You don't think of people who knit a lot as being obsessive or weirdos. My hobby is making ice cubes that are really good,” English laughs. “So save your judgment, people.” English has noticed an uptick in the number of people doing ice projects the last few years. “Initially, the process that I shared was known among bartenders, but it really took off only during the pandemic when a lot more people were trying to make good-looking drinks at home,” he says. In his book, English demonstrates not only how to make clear ice, but also how to suspend flowers and fruit inside cubes, make frozen punch bowls, and how to create frozen spheres to hold cocktails. Ice, he says, can do much more than simply cool down a drink, and even a single cube of clear or colorful ice can make a cocktail feel special. “I often use the analogy of drinking fine champagne out of a Styrofoam cup while sitting in a ditch, as opposed to drinking the same champagne from a crystal flute in a fine-dining cocktail bar,” English says. “It's the same champagne, but the experience is elevated with a better visual environment.”",

    "title": "Archaeologists Explore Life After Dark in the Ancient Night",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/life-after-dark-ancient-night",
    "description": "This story was originally published on SAPIENS and appears here with permission under a CC BY-ND 4.0 license. As recently as a few decades ago in the Western world, stars dazzled humans with their brightness and the Milky Way could be seen spanning the far reaches of the heavens as night deepened into an unspeakable darkness. In the 21st century, such a scene is becoming a rarity across many parts of the globe as we light up the night like never before. Today our experience of the night differs significantly from that of our ancestors. Before they mastered fire, early humans lived roughly half their lives in the dark. The only night light they had came from the moon when skies were clear. Then, when humans began to gain some control over fire use (probably around 400,000 years ago), everything changed. From that point on, most people have had access to some form of “artificial” light, at least occasionally. Thus began our persistent efforts to light up the night. Even people who lived relatively recently—those with candles, oil lamps, and early electricity—were far more familiar with darkness than we are today. Their nocturnal world simply wasn’t as bright as ours. But what have we gained by illuminating the night? Has anything been lost in our efforts to banish darkness? Were people, and the world, better off when it was darker? The night has always fascinated people, for it brings with it a simultaneously feared and revered part of our existence. Yet the scientific journey into understanding ancient nights has been long in coming: Only recently have archaeologists begun to research what life was like after dark in the ancient world. Were people better off when it was darker? A few years ago, when we began thinking about the night lives of our ancestors, we found little academic work on the subject. The more we thought about the nocturnal, whether it was during the Paleolithic (which coauthor April Nowell studies), or during Classic Maya times (which coauthor Nancy Gonlin researches), the more we realized that very little research had been explicitly conducted on it. That is when we embarked on the process, with the assistance of many of our fellow archaeologists, of putting together the book Archaeology of the Night (2018), which we coedited. Ancient nocturnal habits were numerous and were like the many kinds of nightly activities in which we modern humans engage: sleeping, sex, stargazing, work, ceremonies, secret meetings, and so on. Take the ancient Romans, for example. If you think that a noisy nightlife is a hallmark of the modern world, think again! Ancient Rome was a busy and often loud place. Wheeled vehicles provisioned the city’s taverns and took away its waste, and people partied until dawn during festivals, prompting one poet to write, “The laughter of the crowd passing by awakens me and all Rome is at my bedside.” Rome’s citizens often took advantage of the cover of darkness to pee over their balconies or dump objects into the streets, and to engage in crimes ranging from disturbing the peace to assault. A roving band of police rounded up these criminals, and the individual in charge of this law enforcement squad—a man who had been up all night—was also the judge who sentenced them the next morning for their crimes. Ancient Rome reminds us that something as simple as sleep is not the same everywhere and in every time period. How we sleep, where, when, how much, on what, and with whom all have cultural aspects. Cross-cultural night studies challenge what we take to be universal and natural: Twenty-first-century Westerners think that sleeping for eight hours in a row is a good thing, but a Roman example shows that concepts such as normal sleep patterns are, in fact, culturally defined. A “first sleep” of a few hours and then a “second sleep” was a common pattern. In between those times, ancient Romans engaged in some other activity for a short time, such as deep contemplation, prayer, sex, or reading. In ancient Mesoamerica, the Maya built their cities in the tropics during the Classic (250–900) and Post Classic (900–1521) periods. Nighttimes were busy: hunting, guarding the fields, preparing the next day’s meals, feasting, and celebrations all took place when people weren’t sleeping. As dusk set in and vision waned, other senses became heightened. Jaguars roamed the landscape and insects buzzed about, creating a profusion of sounds unique to the night. Tropical plants bloomed in the cool nighttime air, adding scents to the nocturnal ambience. Crackling fires in torches, hearths, and ceramic vessels illuminated and warmed the cool tropical nights and warded off beings, both real and fantastical, in the dark. Night was both an ominous and sacred time. People made offerings to appease the gods who ruled the underworld, thereby ensuring the rising of the sun. The Moon Goddess rode her deer across the night sky, keeping watch over those who dared to venture into darkness. Sacred ceremonies took place in which royal persons imbibed hot, inebriating cacao drinks and danced at midnight. People across the social spectrum practiced bloodletting—drawing blood with obsidian blades, stingray spines, and thorn-lined ropes—in order to honor their ancestors. Astronomical readings of Venus determined whether war was on the horizon or if peace was prudent. Likewise, in the urban area of Copan, Honduras, for some 250 years (600–850) city dwellers shared a noisy nocturnal life in closely built housing. They slept on their stone benches, which were covered with cloth and padding for comfort. Others who lived outside of the city likely had portable sleeping mats, like those found from the incredibly well-preserved Classic farming community of Joya de Cerén, El Salvador. The Classic Maya wrote about many of these activities, and we are fortunate today to be able to understand their hieroglyphic writing, some of which gives us insight into their nightlife. In other areas of the world, people created lighting technologies that inform us about the relationships they perceived between the night, darkness, and death. Every day at dusk in ancient Egypt, the sun god Ra died in the west, casting the world into darkness. According to ancient Egyptians, the dead also traveled to the west—to Osiris, god of the underworld. Lighting played essential roles in funerary rituals during the dynasties of the New Kingdom period, which began in 1570 B.C. (nearly a thousand years after the Pyramids at Giza were built) and ended in 1069 B.C. “Wicks-on-sticks” are pictured on the famous Book of the Dead papyrus, and one of these lighting devices was discovered in King Tutankhamun’s tomb. These are just a few of the nighttime practices that have taken place around the world over the course of history. In Oman, Bronze Age (3100–1300 B.C.) farmers irrigated their crops in the cool night air to reduce evaporation, and later, in Iron Age Zimbabwe (200–1900), metalworkers fired up their forges at night to escape the blaze of the sun. Over 4,000 years ago in ancient Pakistan at the famous archaeological site of Mohenjo-daro, the removal of night soil (human excrement) was a task that was considered best suited to darkness, and in Polynesia, for centuries, ancient mariners looked to the stars to guide them on their long journeys home. The Vikings living in northern Europe during the Dark Ages used fish-oil, whale-fat, and seal-blubber lamps to light the dark interiors of their pithouses, and in 19th-century Bahamas, enslaved people achieved freedom, if only for a while, under cover of darkness. Fast-forward to today, when the glow from cityscapes drowns out the stars and creates a brilliant night sky our ancestors would not recognize. As we’ve studied the archaeology of the night, we’ve become starkly aware of how much we are losing today by over-lighting the world. Our modern nocturnal footprint is so bright that it is detected from outer space. We have “night mayors” in cities that never sleep, millions of people working night shifts, and health problems associated with the disappearing night as darkness gives way to the brightness of electrical illumination. Recent research demonstrates that circadian rhythms control 10–15 percent of our genes and that interruptions of these rhythms are linked to medical disorders such as heart disease, insomnia, and depression. Some researchers even suggest that certain cancers are likely caused by exposure to excessive nighttime lighting. There are also social implications to our overlit lifestyles: For most of our past, people would gather around campfires at night to tell stories and sing songs, much like many Westerners do today on the rare occasions when we find time to go camping. With the advent of electric light, we don’t need to congregate in one place—we are free to follow more solitary pursuits, bathed in our individual sources of light. On top of the health and social effects among humans, the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA), a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the dark environment of night, has brought to our attention the ecological damage we are causing to numerous species all over the world. There are many “poster animals” for the impacts of our harmful light pollution: Sea turtles and migrating birds stand out as those most endangered by humans’ nocturnal habits. Not to mention the fact that more lights require the burning of more fossil fuels and thus an increased contribution to climate change. The IDA provides numerous ideas about how we can regain the dark, such as using dark-sky friendly outdoor lighting and advocating for lighting ordinances in local communities. Even in the brightest countries in the world, such as Japan, it’s possible to preserve an entire area, such as the certified International Dark Sky Place in the national park of the Yaeyama Islands. Each of us can do our part to lessen the brightness of modern nights. Our archaeological inquiries into the night have taught us that while our relationships with the night have shifted, we remain part of the darkness, part of the night. It is essential to our well-being—and that of the planet—that we do what we can to turn out the lights.",
