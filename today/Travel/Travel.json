    "description": "Our writer recalls his favourite mountain experiences, from hard-won views to splendid isolation and the comforts of simple refugesAfter a tough scramble to the summit of Rhinog Fach, we look down into the deep valley holding the chilly waters of Llyn Hywel, then west across several miles of heather, bilberry and bare rock to the Welsh coast. Turning my gaze north, there is the entire Llyn peninsula leading east to the peak of Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon), no doubt weighed down by thousands of visitors. Up here there are just two of us in an utterly peaceful landscape. No clouds on the horizon. No surprises.I lie down for a few minutes and feel myself drift off. There are no human voices to be heard, only birds. Summer has come early to these mountains and I wouldn’t be anywhere else, drinking in that particular kind of tranquillity to be found on a peak under a blue sky. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Listen and subscribe to the Atlas Obscura Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps. Dylan Thuras: Hey everybody, Dylan here. So it has been, boy, over five years since the pandemic shutdown. That both feels at once like incredibly long ago and like weirdly recent. I think for a lot of people, when you think back on that period, the early days of the pandemic, especially that first year, year and a half, you know, the conversations are about the things that changed, the places, and sometimes the people we lost during that period. Even if you didn’t lose anybody, you probably had a restaurant that closed or maybe an office that got shut down. Maybe you had to maybe move out of your city or you had to change schools. So there was obviously a lot of loss during that time. But we also know that there was some things that were gained. And for this episode, we want to ask the staff at Atlas Obscura about what places they gained during the pandemic, what new relationships were formed during a time when you could do so little of what your normal experience was, when you had to kind of find this whole new way of being in the world. And I know at least for myself, you know, I came to know this state park nearby me incredibly well during that period. It was a kind of glorious haven to retreat to during a time when a lot felt really uncertain. And I still love it. It is a very, very special place to me in no small part because of the role it played. Well, I could not see people very easily or go to the places I was used to going. So we are going to talk about all the relationships that people built with new places during the pandemic. And there are some really, really surprising stories in there. Okay, here is the episode. This is an edited transcript of the Atlas Obscura Podcast: a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Find the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps. Luz Fleming: What’s up, everybody? This is Luz Fleming, your audio guy. So me and my family moved to Vancouver, B.C. in August of 2019, just months before the pandemic hit and everyone went into full lockdown. And I barely had a chance to get to know anybody before that. I was lucky enough to meet a drummer named James Ash. And we became fast friends. But when we could no longer meet in person indoors as musicians, we decided to try to find a place outdoors where we might be able to meet safely and play together at a safe distance outside with plenty of moving air. So, I remembered this tunnel that runs under the on ramp to the Iron Workers Bridge onto the One. And the tunnel is between Empire Field and New Brighton just before you leave Vancouver for North Vancouver. And I remember riding through that tunnel with my son on our bikes and just immediately noticing how amazing the acoustics were. And there was this incredible slapback delay slash reverb. And we would hoot and holler and snap. And we did it every time we rode our bikes through there. So when James and I were trying to decide where we could meet and play music, I immediately thought of that tunnel for its acoustics. And it had the added benefit of being a tunnel where we could go there and play during really wet, dreary, cold Vancouver days. And we wound up meeting there regularly. And soon enough, James had some friends and some fellow collaborators who really wanted to get on board. And so other musicians would come and sit in with us, and we did a bunch of recording, and absolutely everyone who drove by or walked by or rode their bike interacted in some way or another. Whether honking a horn or waving or thumbs up or stopping and staying for a while and chatting with us. And it was just such a great way to keep that musical collaboration continuing and to receive that communal energy back and forth. It just became this incredible meeting place. And yes, now that we can meet indoors and other closer quarters, we have gone to the tunnel less and less, but we still do go back there just to meet in that really cool space and hear those incredible acoustics and to remember about that time that we shared there and the community that was built around that space. Here’s a little recording of some of the stuff we did there. Johanna Mayer: Hi, this is Johanna. I live in Brooklyn, New York. I’m the senior producer of the show. And the place that I really got to know during COVID is a cemetery, Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. And it might sound kind of morbid to think about strolling through a cemetery in the midst of a pandemic, but it’s really one of the most peaceful and beautiful places that I have encountered in the city. It is just full of magnolias and cherry trees. It’s also the highest point in Brooklyn, is in that cemetery. So you can walk up the hill and you get this incredible view of Manhattan. I don’t know if anybody else remembers how clear the skies felt when airline traffic was down during that time, but it was just this really cinematic, crystal clear view of the city from that point in Brooklyn. I also learned, side note, that in about the 1860s, this was one of the first rural cemeteries in America. And other people thought the cemetery was beautiful too, because it was one of the biggest tourist attractions in the United States. It was second only to Niagara Falls for a time, which is amazing. I spent a lot of time walking through that cemetery during the pandemic. The parks in the city got kind of crowded. The cemetery felt a lot more open. I remember one particular afternoon, I walked in there and heard bagpipes being played, which sounds maybe kind of corny in retrospect, but it was very moving at the time. A whole groups of little clusters of people in their own little pods were standing at a distance, everybody watching this bagpipe player in the cemetery under the magnolia trees. I think about that moment a lot. And I still go to the cemetery all the time. It started during the pandemic, but just this past year, I moved so that now I live right across from it. I can see the cemetery out my window. And it feels odd to have gained a place during the pandemic, because so often we hear about the loss, but I am just really thankful that that cemetery is in my life and on my radar now. Kameel Stanley: Hey Atlas Obscura, this is Kameel, also the executive producer of the show. One of the things that COVID brought into my life was hiking. Before COVID, I had hiked off and on, but not very regularly and certainly not as much as I started doing in that period of the lockdown when we were told we couldn’t really leave and things like that. Well, my rebellious spirit automatically said, well, if I can’t leave, then I must leave. I must leave the house. So one Saturday morning, I looked up, “Where’s the nearest state park to me?” and drove about 30 to 40 minutes and ended up at one of the state parks not too far from the city. And this park called Babler kind of became my place. It became a cherished place that I still go to many Saturdays, and it’s a place for me to be surrounded in nature, but it’s also become a place that I can’t imagine my life without. There are well-worn paths, there are paths that if you’re a little adventurous, you may not know exactly where you’re going. I’ve gotten attuned to the change of the seasons. I know at what point of the year I like to hike through there and at what point of the year I don’t. It’s no surprise if you know me, it’s when it’s cold. I’ve gotten to see how things change when a tree falls or when an animal has run through. It’s where I’ve worked out problems. It’s where I’ve cried. It’s where I’ve laughed. It’s where I’ve met strangers who have been kind to me. It’s where I’ve gotten angry at the world when I see people carving things in the trees. It’s really, really special. It’s about that time of year when the weather is finally good enough for me to be out every weekend on the trails, and I cannot wait to get to Babler this weekend. Amanda McGowan: Hello, Atlas listeners. It’s Amanda McGowan here, producer on the show. And thinking about places that COVID changed my relationship to, I think I would say the library. So in the days pre-COVID, I actually used to work on a live radio show that would broadcast from a studio that was in the Boston Public Library downtown, which is very cool. Like people, you know, it was in the cafe and people would sit there and talk to you, whatever. But you know, when you work somewhere, you go there all the time. It just becomes part of your background noise. But then during COVID, everything closed, of course. And it was like a very Joni Mitchell kind of, “you don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone” experience. But the library did something amazing, which was when everything shut down, they had all of these electronic resources available. So you could use your library card, you could download an app on your phone for free, instantly download books, movies, audio books, magazines directly to your phone from home. And now that’s like a huge part of my life. I constantly have Libby holds like coming up and stressing me out because I just can't read as fast as my holds are coming in. But anyway, and when everything opened back up again, I just really appreciated the library in a new way. And I think that’s what the library in a new way. I was like, Oh, thank God I can putter around somewhere again, flip through books, flip through magazines, just like, you know, wasting time in a space that’s not my home. Thank God. The library near me now has free concerts and free art shows. And you can go pick up like a national park pass or a state park pass for free. Now I’ve totally become a library evangelist. There’s just so much cool stuff out there that libraries make available to us. Such a fantastic resource.

    "title": "Meet the Volunteers Who Keep Thru-Hikers Moving",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/pacific-crest-trail-angels",
    "description": "In 2023, Ashley Lynn Neville was hiking the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail with her husband and their daughter, pushing big miles to reach Oregon’s Cascade Locks in time for Pacific Crest Trail Days: an annual outdoor festival that caters to thru-hikers. The trio was still a day or two out from the city and their spirits were high, but the fatigue was real. As they approached a road junction near Lolo Pass, just past the trail’s mile marker 2117, they noticed a propped-up piece of brown cardboard with the words “Trail Magic” written across it in bold, black Sharpie. And beside it: a canopy tent, a circle of camp chairs, and a low fire where a tall, bearded man was grilling hot dogs for any weary hikers who came his way. “Packs were dropped. Shoes came off,” Neville says. “It was a moment of grace.” The tall, bearded man was what’s known as a “trail angel.” These self-appointed volunteers offer unexpected acts of kindness and generosity to hikers along long-distance trails, including the 2,653-mile-long Pacific Crest Trail or “PCT,” which runs along the Pacific Coast from the U.S.–Mexico border to the U.S.–Canada border, traversing desert, forests, national parklands, and mountain passes along the way. Participants in the informal trail angel network are often motivated by personal aspirations, connecting with others, and even motherly instincts—similar to strangers cheering on marathon participants from the sidelines or travel enthusiasts offering their couches to young globetrotters coming through. Some offer hikers rides to and from town, while others will greet them at trailheads with everything from slices of fresh watermelon to pancake breakfasts and make-your-own taco bars. Paying a hiker’s tab at a local restaurant, providing a place for a hot shower, even performing trail maintenance are some of the many forms of trail magic that trail angels perform. Ani Benson, an office manager from Bellevue, Washington, first got interested in becoming a trail angel around her 50th birthday, when she was looking for a way to celebrate outdoors. “I’m a hiker,” she says, “but I’ve never done anything like the PCT. I’m just so fascinated by it.” She learned about trail angels through YouTube videos and various friends. “I thought that would be cool to do.” Benson got her first opportunity to work trail magic several years later, when Carolyn “Ravensong” Burkhart—who became the first woman to solo thru-hike the PCT in 1976 and is now the proprietor of the Lion’s Den, a hiker hostel in the tiny community of Mazama, Washington—put out a call for drivers over Labor Day weekend. “I wasn’t doing anything,” Benson says, “so I wrote back and said, ‘I can be there around lunchtime.’” She drove four hours north from Bellevue, picked up a group of hikers, and drove them another four or so hours south to Sea-Tac Airport while talking the whole time. Since then she’s continued to provide transport to hikers and help them gather their resupplies, including food, water, medication, and gear. “It satisfies the mom instinct in me, to want to take care of people,” she says. Benson describes one October afternoon after a heavy rain storm, when she’d been at the Lion’s Den helping to shut things down for the season. A hunter pulled up with two women hikers in his truck, both of them soaked to the bone. “They looked like drowned rats and were wearing garbage bags to try and stay dry,” she says. Benson immediately went into mom mode. “‘OK,’ I said, ‘get your butts in here.’” She handed them some extra clothes that the hostel keeps handy—flannel pajama pants and Hawaiian shirts—and urged them to take a hot shower before getting changed. In true trail angel fashion, she washed their wet clothes and made sure the hikers were properly cared for and ready before they returned to the trail. Former commercial fisherman Scott Maloy knew nothing about the PCT before his then 18-year-old daughter decided to thru-hike it several years ago. “I had a lot of apprehension about it,” he says, “but the more I learned about the trail the more psyched I got and wanted to help.” His first foray into trail magic came between Mount San Jacinto and Big Bear Lake in southern California’s San Bernardino National Forest. Maloy flew down from Washington, where he’s based, rented a four-wheel drive Jeep, and stopped at both Costco and Walmart to load an empty cooler with steak, lobster, strawberries, fresh whipped cream, ground beef, and bagels. He set it all up in a rented cabin equipped with a shower, washer, and dryer, then hiked in to meet his daughter and her “trail family.” Once back at the cabin, they feasted. “We had steak and lobster, strawberry shortcake, and even lobster bagels for breakfast one morning,” he says. Maloy’s magic also included condiment packets that can add a lot of flavor to bland camping food, replacement lids for reusable water bottles, and extra chargers that he set up in his Jeep for hikers to re-up their battery-powered devices. Some of the thru-hikers stayed overnight while others just paused their treks for an hour or two, but once Maloy’s daughter was back on her way, he realized he wasn’t yet ready to go. “I thought to myself, ‘I’ve got all this stuff and I’m already here,’” he says. “‘I might as well stay a little longer.’” He stuck around, treating some thru-hikers to his remaining food and taking others to pick up their resupplies. “I just admire what they’re doing and want to help them—it’s such a cool thing.” In some cases TAs will take gas money or payment for food, though the purest form of being a trail angel is offering assistance without expecting anything in exchange. “Obviously there’s a position of privilege to being able to have that flexibility and time and resources to be able to do that,” says a trail angel who goes by her initials, M.E.G.. “For me, I feel like I can.” M.E.G., who lives in central Washington and works from home, had been reading books on the PCT and found a few area Facebook groups that mentioned trail angels. It was the perfect fit. “I do a little bit of hiking,” she says, “but I prefer to help out more.” Like many trail angels, M.E.G. likes to be a part of the action without becoming the main event. Around 2014, she signed up with the hospitality exchange service CouchSurfing to connect with strangers traveling through the Pacific Northwest. “At the time I wasn’t able to offer them a place to stay,” M.E.G. says, “but I would pick them up from the airport, take them around, and give them a tour of [the town] where I was living at the time.” These days, M.E.G. and her husband sometimes offer thru-hikers a place to stay and a home-cooked meal, as well as an occasional ride or some baked goods. “Just something as simple as a muffin means so much to them,” she says. They once hosted a thru-hiking German couple for an entire week because one of them had sustained a leg injury. A year or two later, M.E.G. and her husband went over to Hamburg to visit them. “The trail has definitely led to a lot of great connections.” But as welcoming as trail magic is for many PCT thru-hikers, it can be overdone. After all, solitude is what attracts many thru-hikers in the first place. The Pacific Crest Trail Association, a self-proclaimed “eclectic band of trail junkies” that’s been committed to protecting, maintaining, and advocating for the PCT since 1977, recommends keeping any sort of trail magic gathering small, and reminds trail angels to never leave food and drink (which can attract wild animals and create trash) unattended. Trail magic also makes the biggest impact where hikers need it most: away from major highways and in less traveled sections of the trail, such as central California’s Sierra mountain range. Not every hiker sees the magic in trail angels (according to a August 30, 2016, Outside article, “The question of whether trail angels, posted in droves along the country’s most popular trails, degrade the wilderness experience is a legitimate one”), and there have undoubtedly been bad experiences when it comes to angels and hikers alike. But according to both M.E.G. and Neville (who’s since become a trail angel herself), those encounters are few and far between. Instead, the trail angels are a tight-knit community that finds joy and solace in what the hikers are doing, while satisfying some personal incentives of their own. “In Western culture, independence and self-sufficiency are often seen as the ultimate goals, but the trail shows you that being self-sufficient doesn’t mean going it alone,” Neville says. “Being at the mercy of the weather, terrain, and your body ... the kindness of others becomes not just helpful, but sacred. Trail angels are such a profound part of that.” Plan your next adventure with our Explorer’s Guide to the National Parks, packed with overlooked wonders, expert tips, and all the best spots to visit.",
