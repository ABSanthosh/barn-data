    "description": "Tracing part of an ancient highway in Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire – now the A1 – proves rich in stories going back 2,000 yearsAfter a while it is clear that someone, or something, is following us. A figure, some distance back. But here’s the thing: it doesn’t appear to draw any closer, or get further away. It seems to remain, matching our pace, just at the edge of vision – at the edge of the dusk now descending over the grand Lincolnshire parkland surrounding Burghley House. When we stop, the figure vanishes. When we set off again, it returns. A shrouded shape; a shadow stalking our steps.Perhaps it shouldn’t be a surprise. The old Roman highway we’ve been intermittently tracing from Water Newton to Stamford is a nine-mile track layered with history. Now overgrown and concealed, it was once a bustling leg of a great north-south thoroughfare that has run, in some form or another, like a backbone through the body of Britain for at least 2,000 years. A unique assemblage of ancient trackway, Roman road, medieval path, pilgrim route, coach road and motorway. Today, hereabouts, its modern incarnation – the A1 – loops west, leaving, as it does in many places, forgotten, discontinued ghost highways to their own devices. Continue reading...",

    "description": "The north of England’s most overlooked natural beauty spot is home to wild terrain and some of the UK’s rarest birds, including the spectacular hen harrierA grey male drifts slowly across the moorland. No, not me, but a big, beautiful hen harrier, scouting for love, or breakfast. I’ve only been here 10 minutes, and I’m in a mild state of shock. Aren’t these precious, threatened birds of prey so vanishingly rare that seeing one is hugely improbable?I’m walking with Sonja Ludwig, RSPB species and habitats officer for the Forest of Bowland, and she knows these harriers. “They’re ‘traditional’ birds,” she says. “They tend to come back to more or less the same place. We always see them here. Rookies always notice the males first. Their plumage, white rump and the black tips on the wings are unmistakable.” Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mogollon-ghost-town",
    "description": "After driving nine miles up a narrow, winding road in the rugged Mogollon Mountains, the ghost town of Mogollon emerges from Silver Creek Canyon like an apparition. Officially established in 1890, the town of Mogollon boomed with rich deposits of gold and silver, as well as timber. People flocked to Mogollon, and by 1915, the town had electricity, water, and telephone lines. Mogollon even had saloons, restaurants, a hospital, a theater, and two red-light districts. At the town’s height there were a few thousand people living there. Fires and floods have killed residents and all but destroyed Mogollon multiple times throughout its history. Still, the residents rebuilt. Low demand for precious metals during World War II, coupled with another fire, caused all but one of Mogollon’s mines to close. By the 1970s, all mining came to a halt, leaving the remote town empty.  Today, Mogollon has some seasonal residents and small businesses. Visitors can enter the Mogollon Museum and browse artifacts such as old photos and documents, clothing, mining tools, and even a recreated mine shaft in the building’s old root cellar. The town also has a woodworking shop open for visitors. The visitor center in the Old Kelly Store sells local art, jewelry, books, and other merchandise, including the visitor center owner’s original art. A mile up Fanny Road, North of Mogollon’s Historic District, is Mogollon Cemetery. The trees and plants obscure the graves, and visitors can wind their way around the cemetery like a labyrinth. Many of those interred in the cemetery died in the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic. The road to the cemetery has a view of Mogollon from above, as well as views of other abandoned homes and miner’s shacks.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/governor-calvert-house-hypocaust",
    "description": "Tucked inside the Governor Calvert House in Annapolis, Maryland, is a hypocaust—an early heating system discovered during excavations. Inspired by ancient Roman technology, this system worked by circulating hot air under the floors. Built in the 17th or early 18th century, it was not only used to heat the house but also to grow plants and citrus in colder months.  The Governor Calvert House is a historic building in downtown Annapolis. Built in the late 1600s, it was once home to Charles Calvert, the fifth Lord Baltimore, who played an important role in Maryland's early history. Over the years, it has been renovated and expanded, combining its original colonial style with modern features. A 20th-century archaeological dig discovered the hypocaust, which can be seen under a plexiglass floor.",
