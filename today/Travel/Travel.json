    "description": "The UK’s first national trail was established to help secure a right to roam. To mark its anniversary, our writer takes on a particularly wild sectionHigh on the ridges of the Pennines, somewhere between the waters of Malham Tarn in the Yorkshire Dales and Kirk Yetholm in the Scottish Borders, a 31-year-old woman stands amid a group of mainly male walkers. She’s wearing bell-bottom jeans, a fitted long-sleeve top and an Alice band to keep her hair out of her face in the prevailing westerly wind. Her name is Joyce Neville and the year is 1952. She’s in the middle of a walk along a proposed national trail – the Pennine WayJoyce had seen an advert for this self-described “Pioneer Walk” in the Sunday newspapers a few months earlier. It was placed by the writer and campaigner Tom Stephenson who was requesting “accomplished walkers, fit and over 18” to take part in a 15-day hike on the “long green trail” he was suggesting be created in Britain (inspired by the US’s 2,200-mile Appalachian Trail). Few women wore jeans back then, according to Joyce’s notes (which were passed on to me by Paddy Dillon, author of Cicerone’s Walking the Pennine Way guidebook), and the whole trip cost just £25.

    "description": "Idyllic scenery is just part of the appeal of a break that is also about sustainability, meeting locals and maintaining pathsArmed with gloves and pruners, my friend and I are near Pythara waterfall above Chora – the capital of the Greek island of Andros – and we are cutting back thorny and overhanging vegetation. We’re helping out the local volunteer association, Andros Routes, which has been restoring a network of ancient mule tracks, from the coast to the interior and its low mountains. The tracks form part of a new walking holiday that allows us to explore the pretty island on foot – and give something back, too.The eight-day trip with Ramble Worldwide takes you from the south-east to the north-west, from Ormos Korthiou to Gavrio, via Chora on the east coast, with accommodation in low-key hotels and luggage transfer between them. Daily routes are only suggested: guests can choose full-on trekking days or easy circular walks, customising the holiday to suit energy levels and using buses or taxis to skip sections if desired. Along the way you can choose to help with the maintenance of the paths (secateurs and gloves are delivered to your hotel). Continue reading...",

    "description": "Dalkey Island is an uninhabited island off the coast of Dalkey, not too far from Dublin. Once a Viking outpost and later a Christian holy site, Dalkey has a long history of use. A short walk from the dock, there are the 7th century ruins of St Begnet's Church, and farther on, an old fort as well as a tower from the Napoleonic period. The island hosts wonderful rock scrambling and spectacular views. There are rabbit holes and rabbits all over the island. One visitor claimed to have watched a rabbit scale a brick wall like some kind of vampire. A herd of goats live here, as well as numerous seals who occupy the rocks and the surrounding waters. Walking along the shoreline closest to Dalkey, one can also find the ruins of St. Begnet’s Well. Ancient Christians would make a pilgrimage here to get healed by the waters.  It was also called \"scurvy well\" as it was rumored to provide relief from that ailment for sailors.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bronze-cow-chicago",
    "description": "In 1998, a Chicago shoe retailer named Peter Hanig saw a public art display of cows while visiting Zurich, Switzerland. The fanciful exhibit inspired him to create a similarly whimsical display in his native city. The following year, a collaboration with Commissioner of Cultural Affairs, Lois Weisberg allowed Hanig to bring \"Cows On Parade\" to life. His brainchild spawned similar public displays in many other cities throughout the U.S. In 2001, long after \"Cows On Parade\" had been put out to pasture, Hanig continued to receive positive feedback from fans expressing their fondness for the cows and lamenting their disappearance. In response, Hanig gifted \"The Bronze Cow\" to the people of Chicago. This throwback to \"Cows On Parade\" is an 8 foot long, 4 1/2 foot tall bronze bovine that stands outside the Chicago Cultural Center. Its eyes are etched with images of the Water Tower and Picasso's untitled sculpture.",
