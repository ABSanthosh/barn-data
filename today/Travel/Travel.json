    "description": "The spectacular Shetland archipelago – with its dive-bombing gannets, ancient settlements and endless horizons – is the perfect spot for a holiday with kidsIt takes us 38 hours – two trains, a tube, the Caledonian Sleeper, a day in Aberdeen, a hire car and the NorthLink ferry – to reach Shetland from our home in Oxfordshire, and yet the immortal words “Are we there yet?” are not uttered once. When the ferry docks at Lerwick, the kids, Lydia (11) and Alex (eight), are uncharacteristically silent as we take in the view: the town huddled on a low hill, the water shimmering in the morning sun, and islands as far as the eye can see.We are spending a week in the archipelago, travelling first around Mainland, the main island, and then north to the less populated islands of Yell and Unst, linked by regular ferries. It turns out to be the perfect location for a family holiday: short journey times (it takes 80 minutes to drive from the southern tip of Mainland to the northern) combined with the sea almost always being in view, and the excitement of a boat or ferry trip every day.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/daugim-cross",
    "description": "Many centuries ago, Old Goa was also called \"Cidade de Goa\" (City of Goa) or \"Goa Dourada\" (Golden Goa). It had two bustling suburbs called Daugim to the east and Panelim to the west, amongst others. Daugim, the eastern suburb, was home to the Madre De Deus Church, which was eventually shifted to Saligao in North Goa. Due to the presence of the church, Daugim was also referred to as \"Madre De Deus.\" The suburb was also the residence of Fidalgos (Portuguese aristrocrats). According to historical sources, the area was a community hub populated with many houses. Eventually, after capital was moved from Old Goa to Panaji in the 1840s,  Old Goa and its suburbs fell into neglect and disrepair. The Church of Madre De Deus moved from Daugim to Saligao. Today, Daugim is a largely deserted area and has been reduced to a memory from the past. However, some reminders of its once vibrant existence remain in the form of old relics and ruins dotting the area. One such marker is a memorial cross which stands on the side of the road connecting Old Goa to the village of Gandaulim. An inscription on the cross reads: \"Calcada De Daugim.\" \"Calcada\" translates to sidewalk or pavement or in some contexts, roadway. The location of this marker gives an idea of the location of this once thriving but now deserted suburb of Old Goa. The place lives on in memory by means of this marker.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-grave-of-james-lick",
    "description": "James Lick was a 19th-century entrepreneur who owned many hotels, orchards, and other businesses in and around San Francisco. For much of his life he was not particularly generous, but this changed after he had a stroke and started to fund many charities.  His dream was to have a large pyramid in the middle of the city where he could be entombed, but fortunately, he got talked out of that by his peers. Instead, Lick donated an astronomical $700,000 (roughly $25 million today) to build the world's most advanced observatory atop Mount Hamilton, about 70 miles (112 km) southeast of San Francisco. The Lick Observatory opened in 1888. It was the first observatory with permanent staff on the mountain. Many discoveries were made there, including several moons of Jupiter, as well as exoplanets.  Lick himself supports these discoveries in a rather literal way, as his coffin was interred in the pillar on which the telescope stands. His gravestone is only visible from below the platform and rarely open to visitors. One of Lick's stipulations was that his grave be marked with flowers, which is why a plastic bouquet can be found in front of the marker to this day.",
