    "description": "The city and its stunning setting on Scotland’s north-east coast are surprisingly easy to explore by rail, bus and on footSeabirds fly below the train as it crosses the Firth of Forth with late afternoon light sparking the water. A kestrel hovers over hay meadows near Kirkcaldy. The lumpy Lomond Hills are sun-misted and the woods are touched with autumn gold. The final stretch of the seven-hour train journey from London to Aberdeen runs along the rocky Scottish shore past forts and firths. (York-Aberdeen costs from £32.30 one way, London from £68.80, lner.co.uk).Looking back, near Stonehaven station, I can see Dunnottar Castle. The walk from Stonehaven along the cliffs to this castle on its promontory in the North Sea is one of many exceptional car-free days out from Aberdeen. It’s a city I keep coming back to. I first arrived expecting oil rigs, grey buildings, and bad weather – and I found art galleries, wooded lochs, 91 miles of coast, and surprisingly mild weather in one of the UK’s sunniest cities. Aberdeenshire also has good, reliable public transport. I’m spending a week exploring by bus, from the county’s south-west corner in the Cairngorms to Scotland’s first mainland lighthouse on Aberdeenshire’s north-easterly tip. The scenic journeys I take are cheaper with a countywide Bluebird Explorer 7-Day MegaRider (£51.20/£38.40 full price/student). Continue reading...",

    "description": "A trip from the UK in search of late-season sun leads to fresh discoveries in Pompeii as well bonus trips to Procida and PaestumWhen the Mediterranean makes its first appearance, it’s through chilly sheets of rain. I spot the not-very-blue waters between the buildings of Marseille as my train from Paris pulls in. By the time we reach Nice the skies are still grey and I’m starting to wonder how far south I’ll have to go before I get some late-in-the-year sun. Of course, I’m not the first Briton to flee damp, cold drizzle.Back in the autumn of 1820 a sickly John Keats took the same decision. In his case, however, the situation was more critical. His heartfelt line in Ode to a Nightingale, “O for a beaker full of the warm South”, written the previous year, had an edge of desperation. My own goal is Pompeii. That should be far enough, I reckon, to guarantee a warm sun. Not only that, but I have been drawn by recent stories of new discoveries at the ancient site. How much, I wonder, is that stalwart of the tourist circuit changing? An out-of-season visit seems like a good opportunity to see one of the world’s tourist honey pots without the crowds, and feel the sun on my face. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/future-city-galactic-earth-railway",
    "description": "Hanamaki City in Iwate Prefecture is notable for its associations with Kenji Miyazawa, a poet and author of children's literature best known for his fantasy novel Night on the Galactic Railroad, written circa 1927 and posthumously published in 1934. The story follows the adventures of a lonely boy named Giovanni and his friend Campanella as they travel across the galaxy on a fantastical train. It deals with themes of sorrow and self-sacrifice, a reflection of life and death. As with other works by Miyazawa, it is often difficult to interpret and leaves space for theories. In 1993, a new road was constructed in Hanamaki and the city commissioned local artist Osami Yamamoto to create a large mural to reduce the stuffiness given off by the concrete wall. Spanning 80 meters (87.5 yards) long and nearly invisible during the day, the mural is illuminated with UV light after sundown to reveal a stunning tribute to Kenji Miyazawa's novel, depicting a vibrant galaxy with steam locomotive trains running through.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ta-kola-windmill",
    "description": "When the Knights of St. John controlled the islands of Malta, they oversaw the construction of many public works buildings that would benefit the general populace. One of their projects was the construction of windmills for providing flour, and these buildings became central parts of the villages in which they were located. These Maltese windmills all had a very similar yet distinct design. The base of the building was typically slightly broader than the windmill sails and was square, although some windmills had bases with other shapes. This base structure often had two stories. A cylindrical tower with windmill sails stood in the center of the top of this square base.  The entire structure was typically built using beige limestone. A total of about 54 of these windmills were constructed by the Knights of St. John, mainly between the years of 1663 and 1773. When the Industrial Revolution came, however, the use of windmills to produce flour became less efficient, and many windmills fell out of use. Over the years, most of the windmills were either demolished or converted into buildings for other uses, with the sails and the milling mechanisms removed. These decommissioned windmills are quite common across the islands of Malta, while intact windmills are rare. The Ta’ Kola Windmill in Xagħra is one of the few windmills in Malta that has retained its sails and internal milling mechanisms. The mill was originally constructed in 1725 in a different location but was rebuilt in its current location in 1787, and it was in use until 1960. Through the efforts of the family of Ġużeppi Grech, who was the windmill’s last miller, and later the museum authorities who took over the maintenance of the mill, the structure has been preserved remarkably well, and it now functions as a museum sharing the story of Malta’s windmills with all of its visitors.",
