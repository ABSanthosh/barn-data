    "description": "The opening of the V\u0026A East Storehouse and Sadler’s Wells East mark the transformation of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park into an exciting new creative hub for the capitalThere’s a collective intake of breath as the curator slowly unzips the white garment bag to reveal the treasure within: a white military-style jacket embellished with gold buttons and epaulettes, worn by Elton John on his 1981 World tour. To my left, laid out on a table, are a gold Versace bag and a pair of daintily embroidered blue silk shoes dating from the 1720s. To my right, a Vivienne Westwood corset and a Balenciaga pink taffeta evening dress from the 1950s. It’s a fashion lover’s fever dream and it’s all here, at my fingertips.I’m at the V\u0026A East Storehouse in east London, a radical new museum experience that allows anyone to order up any item from the V\u0026A’s vast collection – for free – and to examine it at close quarters. Housed in the former Olympics Media Centre, on the edge of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, this lofty warehouse space gives unprecedented access to more than 250,000 objects, from an 11m wide stage cloth designed by Picasso to a cross-section of a maisonette from the Robin Hood Gardens council estate in Poplar. Gone are the glass cases, white walls and carefully curated exhibits of a traditional museum space. Instead, visitors are invited to look behind the scenes of a working museum, to wander among open shelves stacked high with deliriously eclectic objects and to peer into the workshops where conservators are at work. The effect is part Ikea showroom, part Victorian cabinet of curiosities. It’s bold, slightly bonkers and I love it. Continue reading...",

Which year did Ian Botham make his Test match debut? And how long can a sea anemone live? These were the big questions we considered, sitting outside Heddon Orchard Bothy, listening to the river gurgle through the steep valley (for answers, see * below). I had a fat Penguin book of trivia (1991 edition) balanced on my knees, gifted by a past guest who’d written on the yellowing flyleaf: “This is your only entertainment.”In some ways they were right. The bothy – a 19th-century apple store turned bare-bones bolthole – has nothing. No electricity. No running water – just space for sleeping and access to a loo, 100 metres away. In other ways it has everything you really need. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grave-of-helen-peters-nosworthy",
    "description": "Tucked away in Denver’s historic Fairmount Cemetery, a gravestone marks the final resting place of Helen Peters Nosworthy—the woman who named the Ouija board. Though largely forgotten for decades, her role in the board’s origins is now cemented in stone, thanks to a headstone erected by the Talking Board Historical Society in 2018. Helen Peters Nosworthy was a prominent spiritualist in the late 19th century. On a night in 1890, she sat with the original creators of the Ouija board and asked the mysterious device what it wished to be called. The planchette slid across the board and spelled out “O-U-I-J-A.” When asked what the word meant, the board simply replied: “Good luck.” A deeper mystery lies in the name’s possible origins—Nosworthy was wearing a locket featuring a portrait of the English novelist Ouida, and some believe the board borrowed the name from the author, rather than the spirit realm. Despite her early involvement, Nosworthy later distanced herself from the Ouija board, calling it a board that tells lies. She died in 1940 and was buried in an unmarked family plot, her story fading into obscurity. Nearly 80 years later, occult historians and Ouija enthusiasts rediscovered her contributions, ensuring that her name would not be lost to time. Today, visitors can find her grave marked with an inscription that reads: “The Woman Who Named the Ouija Board.” It stands as a quiet tribute to the peculiar history of one of the world’s most infamous spirit-communication devices.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-tiger-inscription",
    "description": "Caoling Historical Trail is one of the most beloved hiking trails in northern Taiwan. The route is a segment of the larger Tamsui-Kavalan Trails system, which Han Chinese immigrants used to get through the blocking hills and reach the eastern side of the island. Near the highest point of the hiking trail, a stone inscription has welcomed travelers since 1867. The carved inscription features a single tiger (虎) Chinese character in an artistic style. Most native speakers probably might not even recognize the character without an explanation. The word for \"tiger\" comes from the saying, “Clouds follow the dragon, winds follow the tiger.” The original inscriber, General Liu Mingdeng of the Qing army, hoped to calm the perennial winds along the route. Fittingly, you will likely encounter gusts of wind when visiting the stone inscription. Just above the stone is a vista point where the trail finally opens to the Pacific Ocean. From there, you’ll be able to spot Turtle Island and the beautiful Yilan coastline. In the past, hikers would bring ink and paper to make rubbings of the inscription, which caused damage to the original. This practice is no longer permitted, and the government has put up many replicas at the Dali Visitor Center that is located at the end of the trail. Another original tiger inscription—similar in style—can be found in the Pilin Tea Museum. Hikers on the Caoling Historical Trail will also come across another stone inscription, the “Xiongzhen Manyan\" (\"Boldly Quell the Wild Mists\") Monument, if they travel north.",
