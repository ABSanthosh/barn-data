The Turing test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. From the 1940s 1 to the 2010s people programmed computers, and computers could only do what they were programmed to do in a rules-based deterministic manner. Sometimes a person would program the computer and it would do something unexpected, but 100 out of 100 times the computer was doing what it was programmed to do whether the person liked it or not. While there has been experimentation with what today we call AI since the 1950s, those machines were a long ways away from passing the Turing test. Why does using ChatGPT feel more like a conversation with the smartest person you know than a computer? It's because ChatGPT doesn't solve problems deterministically the way a programmed computer does, it solves them probabilistically. 2 ChatGPT demonstrates the ability to think about something in a logical, sensible way, the definition of reasoning. 3 We've created something completely new here, a reasoning computer. 4",

    "link": "https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=jimo1g6z",
    "description": "Lies of P is closer to its surprising source material than you might think.Based on Carlo Collodi’s 1883 novel The Adventures of Pinocchio, the Apple Design Award-winning game is a macabre reimagining of the story of a puppet who longs to be a real boy. Collodi’s story is still best known as a children’s fable. But it’s also preprogrammed with more than its share of darkness — which made it an appealing foundation for Lies of P director Jiwon Choi.“When we were looking for stories to base the game on, we had a checklist of needs,” says Choi. “We wanted something dark. We wanted a story that was familiar but not entirely childish. And the deeper we dove into Pinocchio, the more we found that it checked off everything we were looking for.”ADA FACT SHEETLies of P Winner: Visuals and Graphics Team: ROUND8 Studio (developer), NEOWIZ (publisher) Available on: Mac Team size: 100 Previous accolades: App Store 2023 Mac Game of the Year, App Store Editors’ Choice Developed by the South Korea-based ROUND8 Studio and published by its parent company, NEOWIZ, Lies of P is a lavishly rendered dark fantasy adventure and a technical showpiece for Mac with Apple silicon. Yes, players control a humanoid puppet created by Geppetto. But instead of a little wooden boy with a penchant for little white lies, the game’s protagonist is a mechanical warrior with an array of massive swords and a mission to battle through the burned-out city of Krat to find his maker — who isn’t exactly the genial old woodcarver from the fable.“The story is well-known, and so are the characters,” says Choi. “We knew that to create a lasting memory for gamers, we had to add our own twists.”Those twists abound. The puppet is accompanied by a digital lamp assistant named Gemini — pronounced “jim-i-nee,” of course. A major character is a play on the original’s kindly Blue Fairy. A game boss named Mad Donkey is a lot more irritable than the donkeys featured in Collodi’s story. And though nobody’s nose grows in Lies of P, characters have opportunities to lie in a way that directly affects the storyline — and potentially one of the game’s multiple endings.We knew that to create a lasting memory for gamers, we had to add our own twists.Jiwon Choi, Lies of P director“If you play without knowing the original story, you might not catch all those twists,” says Choi. “But it goes the other way, too. We’ve heard from players who became curious about the original story, so they went back and found out about our twists that way.”There’s nothing curious about the game’s success: In addition to winning a 2024 Apple Design Award for Visuals and Graphics, Lies of P was named the App Store’s 2023 Mac Game of the Year and has collected a bounty of accolades from the gaming community. Many of those call out the game’s visual beauty, a world of rich textures, detailed lighting, and visual customization options like MetalFX upscaling and volumetric fog effects that let you style the ruined city to your liking. For that city, the ROUND8 team added another twist by moving the story from its original Italian locale to the Belle Èpoque era of pre-WWI France. “Everyone expected Italy, and everyone expected steampunk,” says Choi, “but we wanted something that wasn’t quite as common in the gaming industry. We considered a few other locations, like the wild west, but the Belle Èpoque was the right mix of beauty and prosperity. We just made it darker and gloomier.”We considered a few other locations, like the wild west, but the Belle Èpoque was the right mix of beauty and prosperity. We just made it darker and gloomier.Jiwon Choi, Lies of P directorTo create the game’s fierce (and oily) combat, Choi and the team took existing Soulslike elements and added their own touches, like customizable weapons that can be assembled from items lying around Krat. “We found that players will often find a weapon they like and use it until the ending,” says Choi. “We found that inefficient. But we also know that everyone has a different taste for weapons.”The system, he says, gives players the freedom to choose their own combinations instead of pursuing a “best” pre-ordained weapon. And the strategy worked: Choi says players are often found online discussing the best combinations rather than the best weapons. “That was our intention when creating the system,” he says.Also intentional: The game’s approach to lying, another twist on the source material. “Lying in the game isn’t just about deceiving a counterpart,” says Choi. “Humans are the only species who can lie to one another, so lying is about exploring the core of this character.” It’s also about the murky ethics of lying: Lies of P suggests that, at times, nothing is as human — or humane — as a well-intentioned falsehood.“The puppet of Geppetto is not human,” says Choi. “But at the same time, the puppet acts like a human and occasionally exhibits human behavior, like getting emotional listening to music. The idea was: Lying is something a human might do. That’s why it’s part of the game.”The Lies of P story might not be done just yet. Choi and team are working on downloadable content and a potential sequel — possibly starring another iconic character who’s briefly teased in the game’s ending. But in the meantime, the team is taking a moment to enjoy the fruits of their success. “At the beginning of development, I honestly doubted that we could even pull this off,” says Choi. “For me, the most surprising thing is that we achieved this. And that makes us think, ‘Well, maybe we could do better next time.’”Meet the 2024 Apple Design Award winnersBehind the Design is a series that explores design practices and philosophies from finalists and winners of the Apple Design Awards.

    "title": "Working at startups vs large companies",
    "link": "https://swiftrocks.com/working-at-startups-vs-large-companies",
    "description": "Working at a large company like Apple or Google is such a common goal in the tech industry that there's even a market for selling courses and books designed to help people achieve this goal. But one thing that I've learned in my career is that working at such companies is not for everyone. The experience of working at a large company is extremely different from that of a startup, so if you're not aware of those differences, you can end up having a big (negative) surprise down the road that can make you regret your choices. In this article, I'd like to show you the difference between companies of different sizes so that you can determine which one better fits your personal style and interests. Disclaimer: I haven't worked at every company to ever exist in this planet, so this is obviously not a 100% perfect model for every company out there. There are always exceptions, this is just a basic description of the average case. Working at a startup Pros: Great to get experience in a wide variety of topics and areas Growth potential is huge Little to no bureaucracy or politics Generally a great community / vibe overall Cons: Generally crap pay Highly unstable Little to no engineering challenges (startups often prioritize speed) Work is complete chaos Most likely going to work with a product that nobody cares about Working at a startup is the most fun I've had in my career, but I think it takes a special kind of person to thrive in this environment. I feel that working at a startup is ideal if you have an entrepreneurship mindset, because you not only get to be constantly exposed to the organizational side of things, you are likely also involved in it. This allows you to build a lot of experience with how companies work under the hood, which I've found to be really handy overall. Another thing I like about startups is that the vibe is generally very positive. Since there aren't a lot of people in the company, there's basically no bureaucracy and chances are that everyone gets along well. This also makes it so that you can grow quite fast in the company, provided that the company itself is doing well in the first place. In general, startups are a high-risk high-reward situation. While you can win big fast, you can lose big just as fast because any minor setback can destroy the entire company. This is another reason why I find them best for those with an entrepreneurship itch. The work itself also tends to be very chaotic and thus not something that someone looking for stability would enjoy. Another important downside to mention is that the engineering side of things tends to be a bit dull. Since startups often prioritize speed, building things tends to be down-prioritized in favor of going for easy out-of-the-box and / or plug-and-play open-source solutions, making a software engineering job feel more like assembling LEGO than anything else. Every work I had as a mobile engineer at a startup was basically 100% building UI, which became really boring to me after a while. Working at a mid-level company Pros: Generally good pay and benefits Better engineering challenges than the startups Opportunity to work with popular products Mostly stable Cons: Growth potential is not as great when compared to a startup Some bureaucracy / politics Despite the presence of interesting challenges, there aren't many sufficiently skilled engineers to tackle them / the engineering culture is not strong enough The mid-level company is the company that is big enough to overcome the downsides attributed to startups, but nowhere as big enough to have the pros attributed to large companies. In general, the pros/cons of a mid-level company are essentially the averages of the other two cases in this article. The primary problem with mid-level companies is that they try to mimic the processes and objectives of large companies, but have nowhere near as many resources as they do. This results for example in the team being tasked to solve massive engineering infrastructure challenges, because that's what large companies do, even though almost no one in the team is skilled enough to pull it off (likely because most who did have such skills ended up getting poached by the large companies). This puts giant pressure on these select few, which on one side can be seen as a great growth opportunity, but on the other side puts the company into a difficult position, as said people are likely to either burn out or leave in favor of an actual large company. With that said, I find that mid-level companies still offer great growth opportunities. I think they are good choices for people who like the vibe and stability of large companies but can't stand the downsides of working at actual large companies. Working at a large company Pros: Life-changing pay and benefits World-class engineering challenges Opportunity to work with some of the smartest people on the planet In some cases, opportunity to pioneer / define tech trends for the entire planet Opportunity to work with products that are used / loved on the entire planet Apart from potential layoffs, they are extremely stable / too big to fail Cons: Unbearable politics Growth is extremely hard By \"large company\", we're talking about tech giants like Google, Apple, Meta, and so on. Looking at the pros, it's easy to see why people dream of working at such places. But what a lot of people don't know is that there are strong downsides attached to working at such companies, and being able to tolerate them is critical to succeed there. I've met many folks who couldn't and ended up leaving. The first and most critical downside is that everything is covered by a thousand layers of bureaucracy and politics. I cannot overstate how unbearable this is, but it's how things at companies of this size. When you work at a startup, if you want to do something, you just go there and do it. For a mid-level company, it might be slightly more annoying, but still doable. But when you work at a large company, if you want to do something, you're going to have to have a meeting about having a meeting about drafting a document about a meeting about drafting another document, which hopefully will be picked up by the planning season several months later, leading to more meetings and documents until hopefully you get to do some actual work around a year later, unless the company re-orgs sometime during this process, in which case you'll have to drop everything and start from scratch. This boundless bureaucracy extends everywhere, including the promotion process. Growing at such companies can be extremely hard as the process involves considerable amounts of bureaucracy and things that are outside of your control, especially for Staff+ positions. Which team you're part of also plays a big role as some teams are bound to have more opportunities to drive impact than others in a company of this size. I think that thriving at a large company is directly correlated to how much you can tolerate such politics. No one would look at this description and be happy, but if you look at it and feel that you could take it, then working at a large company might be for you. Conclusion As I mentioned in the beginning, this is just a basic description of the average case. There are thousands of exceptions who surely don't fit into these descriptions. But the idea is just to present that the concept of trade-offs also applies to companies and cultural fit. Just because one company is larger than the other doesn't necessarily mean it's best you; depending on what you value, you might find that smaller companies are a better fit for you.",

    "title": "My process for learning new languages",
    "link": "https://swiftrocks.com/my-process-for-learning-new-languages",
    "description": "Throughout my life, I have met several people who struggle to learn a new language, with some of them being unable to communicate at a basic level despite having studied for several years. I believe that learning a language is not a matter of talent, but that of dedication and following a good process. In this article, I would like to share the process I used more than once (and am still using) to tackle the challenge of learning a new language with great success. I currently speak three languages (native Portuguese, English, Swedish), and am in the process of learning a fourth (Japanese). My process For me, learning a new language consists of three major steps: Learning basic grammar Becoming good at reading and listening Becoming good at speaking Learning basic grammar My first step towards learning a new language consists of understanding the basics of the language. This includes things like learning how sentences are structured, how words should be pronounced, how to count, and any other language-specific basics that may apply (for example, for Swedish, learning the difference between en / ett, or the concept of soft / hard vowels). The word \"basic\" here is very important. I want to have a good understanding of how things work in that language, but I don't want to waste time reasoning about complex grammar rules. Think of the sorts of things a mom would correct a child for; my mom would correct me if I used a word in the wrong place, but she wouldn't lecture me about the theory of participle clauses. Knowledge of basic grammar massively pays off because later on it will simplify the process of expanding the vocabulary. Although at this point I will not know many words, my knowledge of basic grammar will allow me to more easily figure out how to pronounce any new words that I may encounter in the future, to properly classify them (subject? verb? noun? adjective? present? past tense?) based on their format and position in a sentence, and in some cases even accurately guess their meaning based on this information. Although in the next section I'm going to complain about traditional language learning books / schools, I think they are one of the best resources for learning basic grammar. It's also usually straightforward and can be mastered in just a couple of months. Becoming good at reading and listening But this is about as far as those language schools and books will help you out, because in my opinion they massively fuck up pretty much everything beyond this point. In my experience, after learning basic grammar, schools and books usually follow up by teaching advanced grammar. I think this is a complete waste of time and is why in my opinion many adults struggle with learning a language despite attending classes for multiple years. Learning complex grammar rules will not help you learn the language, even natives don't know this stuff! What natives know is vocabulary, and this is what I believe is the right focus at this stage. My goal then becomes to expand my vocabulary as much as possible by immersing myself in the language, consuming as much media as I can and as frequently as possible. This is something that is usually referred to as the immersion method. Here are some examples of things I do in this step: Changing the language of my phone / computer Watching shows with either sound or subtitles in that language, preferably both if available Listening to podcasts, sometimes actively and sometimes passively as background noise Finding internet forums / subreddits / YouTube channels for topics I like Reading the news You might think that this doesn't make sense because you won't understand anything, but that's exactly the point. Children also don't understand anything at first, yet magically they seem to just \"get it\" after one point, simply by being exposed to the language. This is because our brains are big pattern-matching machines; the more you expose yourself to a language, the more patterns / words you discover, which leads to further discoveries until you eventually reach a point where everything just clicks. In other words, the purpose of this step is to try to replicate how a child would learn a language at home. I find watching shows / YouTube videos to be particularly excellent for this because you can usually guess what a word means based on the context of the scene, meaning you don't need to spend as much time translating words as you would when compared to other types of media. Duolingo can also be a good tool to expand your vocabulary, as long as you don't use it in isolation. This is because although Duolingo is a good way to learn new words, it tends to be quite bad at everything else (e.g grammar), so I think it's important to back it up with the other methods mentioned in this section. It's important to note also that the quality of Duolingo's exercises varies greatly between languages, so looking for reviews before getting started is a must here. If you tend to quickly forget things like I do, a spaced repetition system can greatly assist you with fixating all of this new knowledge. In my case I quite enjoyed using Readwise for this, but I know many who have used Anki / traditional flashcards with great success. This entire process is very painful at first, but gets easier with time as your vocabulary improves. The unfortunate part is that this is a lengthy process; it can take several years of doing this before reaching a point where reading / listening to the language becomes effortless, and I think there's no way around it. Becoming good at speaking Although the previous step is excellent at making me good at reading and listening, in my experience it doesn't necessarily help me become good at speaking. When I was learning Swedish for example, although I had an easy time understanding what people were saying and knew in theory what to answer back, I still had a very hard time doing so, mostly because I just wasn't used to it. Although I knew the vocabulary in theory, it would still take several seconds for the right words to emerge in my mind when having a conversation with someone. Unlike the other steps, I don't think there is any special method that one can use to become good at speaking a new language. This is something you just have to keep doing until your brain gets used to it. It's a massive advantage if you actually live in the country in question, but this is doable even if you don't as there are many online services designed around connecting you with native speakers of a particular language. I personally never used them though, so I cannot comment on their efficiency. Another interesting to mention is that nowadays there are websites that connect LLMs to voice recognition models, allowing you to chat with something like ChatGPT with your voice for the purpose of language learning. I've tried one but personally didn't like the experience as talking to a robot felt completely different from talking to a real person, but if you'd like to try it out, you can easily find them on Google (there are hundreds of websites for this as of writing). I think the most important part here is to resist the urge to switch to another language when you start to struggle, especially if you live in a country like Sweden where the natives are good at English. (In fact I would say that the hardest thing about learning a language like Swedish is not the language itself, but rather that Swedes are so good at English that they automatically switch to it when they see you struggling with Swedish, making it almost impossible for you to improve!) Conclusion Although we can divide the process of learning a new language in logical steps, we're still talking about a multi-year effort. That's just how it works, there are no shortcuts. If you struggle with learning a new language, I hope this post was able to teach you something new that can help you in your journey!",

    "description": "Two new sizes as the Pro phones grow in size, and weight, and get even smaller bezels. Here’s what you need to know about the iPhone 16. The New Models in a Nutshell As in earlier years, Apple has discontinued the iPhone 15 Pro models and added features to the base iPhone 16 models. Apple also continues to sell the base iPhone 15, iPhone 14, and the iPhone SE. The Pro models increase in size from last year given us four different screen sizes across the iPhone 16 range: The base models have the same screen sizes as last years iPhone 15 models, but still lack ProMotion and the Always-on display. They keep the aluminium body where the Pro models are Titanium. Support for USB-3 (10Gbp/s) transfer speeds is still limited to the Pro models. The displays have the same peak brightness as last year but now have a 1 nit minimum brightness and the latest generation Ceramic Shield. All models now have the Action button and the new Camera Control button. iPhone 16 The iPhone 16 gains new colours, the Action, and Camera Control buttons, and the A18 chip with support for Apple Intelligence.

That screenshot can be for either the 6.9\" or 6.5\" iPhone display. You can upload either of the following sizes for the 6.9\" display (portrait sizes, reverse for landscape): 6.9\" 1320 x 2868 pixels (iPhone 16 Pro Max) 6.7\" 1290 x 2796 pixels (iPhone 16 Plus) If you don’t upload screenshots for the 6.9\" display you can provide either of the following for the 6.5\" display: 6.7\" 1284 x 2778 pixels (iPhone 14 Plus) 6.5\" 1242 x 2688 pixels (iPhone 11 Pro Max) All other iPhone display sizes can use scaled versions of the above.

    "title": "SwiftData Expressions",
    "link": "https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swiftdata-expressions/",
    "description": "SwiftData gained support for predicate expression in iOS 18. How does it compare to the expressions we can use with Core Data? Core Data Queries with NSExpression When Apple launched SwiftData with iOS 17 there were some gaps compared to Core Data. A big one for me was the ability to create an aggregate query (FB12292503). For example, to fetch the minimum, maximum, sum, or average of a property. I first wrote about using a Core Data expression to query for min and max values back in 2012. Here’s an updated example with a Core Data log entity that contains a set of markers: public final class CDLog: NSManagedObject { @NSManaged public var name: String? @NSManaged public var timestamp: Date? @NSManaged public var markers: NSSet? ... } The markers also contain a timestamp: public final class CDMarker: NSManagedObject { @NSManaged public var timestamp: Date? @NSManaged public var log: CDLog? ... } I want to know the range (min…max) of timestamps for the markers in a log entry. One way would be to fetch the markers, sorted by timestamp, and return the timestamps of the first, and last markers. A better way is to have SQLite calculate and directly return the values. Core Data has long supported creating fetch requests and predicates with the Foundation type NSExpression. It takes a lot of code but here’s a request that fetches the minimum (earliest) and maximum (latest) dates of markers in a log entry: public class func boundsRequest( _ timeline: NSManagedObjectID ) -\u003e NSFetchRequest\u003cNSFetchRequestResult\u003e { let request = NSFetchRequest\u003cNSFetchRequestResult\u003e( entityName: CDMarker.entityName) request.predicate = CDMarker.inTimeline(timeline) request.resultType = .dictionaryResultType let keyPathExpression = NSExpression(forKeyPath: \\CDMarker.timestamp) let earliestDescription = NSExpressionDescription() earliestDescription.name = \"earliestDate\" earliestDescription.expression = NSExpression(forFunction: \"min:\", arguments: [keyPathExpression]) earliestDescription.expressionResultType = .dateAttributeType let latestDescription = NSExpressionDescription() latestDescription.name = \"latestDate\" latestDescription.expression = NSExpression(forFunction: \"max:\", arguments: [keyPathExpression]) latestDescription.expressionResultType = .dateAttributeType request.propertiesToFetch = [ earliestDescription, latestDescription ] return request } The two NSExpression properties apply a function (min or max) to a keypath returning the two values in a dictionary. Core Data translates the expressions to an SQLite statement performing the work at the database level. SwiftData Predicate Expressions In iOS 18, SwiftData can make use of Foundation’s new #Expression macro to make it easier to build more complex predicates. From the WWDC session: Expressions allow for reference values that do not produce true or false but instead allow for arbitrary types. You can then evaluate the expression as part of more complex predicate. Let’s see an example. I have an Item model class that can contain one or more Record items: @Model final class Item { var name: String var timestamp: Date var record: [Record] } The Record model includes a score: @Model final class Record { var score: Int ... } Suppose I want to find all items with three or more records of which at least two are a passing score of 90 or more. We can write an expression that counts the number of passing records: let passingScore = #Expression\u003c[Record], Int\u003e { records in records.filter { $0.score \u003e= 90 }.count } Note: The body of the expression is restricted to a single expression. We can then evaluate this expression in a compound item predicate: let highScoring = #Predicate\u003cItem\u003e { item in item.records.count \u003e 2 \u0026\u0026 passingScore.evaluate(item.records) \u003e 1 } The resulting SQL query: CoreData: sql: SELECT 0, t0.Z_PK, t0.Z_OPT, t0.ZNAME, t0.ZTIMESTAMP FROM ZITEM t0 WHERE ( (SELECT COUNT(t1.Z_PK) FROM ZRECORD t1 WHERE ( t0.Z_PK = t1.Z1RECORDS) ) \u003e ? AND (SELECT COUNT(t2.Z_PK) FROM ZRECORD t2 WHERE ( t0.Z_PK = t2.Z1RECORDS AND ( t2.ZSCORE \u003e= ?)) ) \u003e ? ) This look promising but I could already write this predicate without the expression: let highScoring = #Predicate\u003cItem\u003e { item in item.records.count \u003e 2 \u0026\u0026 item.records.filter { $0.score \u003e= 90 }.count \u003e 1 } If you expand the expression macro or check the Expression documentation you’ll see it’s creating PredicateExpressions which appear to support a wide range of methods. Unfortunately I can’t seem to get most of them to work either in predicates or expressions. For example, similar to my earlier Core Data example, here’s an expression to return the maximum score in a collection of records: let maxScore = #Expression\u003c[Record], Int\u003e { records in records.map { $0.score }.max() ?? 0 } That fails to compile: The map() function is not supported in this expression So maybe this will improve in future updates but right now I’m not sure I’m gaining anything from using expressions?

My goal has always been to make NetNewsWire a model net citizen, and learning where it’s not is super valuable. So: much respect and thanks to Rachel for this. The Data Let’s look at some data and try to figure out what’s happening. Here’s Rachel’s report for NetNewsWire. Things to know: these are all requests for a NetNewsWire-specific feed, and the copy of NetNewsWire making these requests is on my personal laptop. That laptop is occasionally used for development, which can throw things off, but not often. You can even see in the data a gap lasting just over two weeks where there were no requests (I was on vacation). (You can also see some anomalies from when I had it on my dev machine also — ignore every row where ip is v6, since that’s my dev machine.) Another thing to know: this is testing direct feed-reading, as with the On My Mac (or iPhone/iPad) and iCloud accounts. With systems such as Feedly, Feedbin, and so on, we get the data from the sync system and not directly from the site. Ignoring Timing Issues Let’s set aside, at least for today, the timing issues. That situation could be improved, but it very much reflects that this is a desktop app with a command that allows you to refresh feeds manually, without having to wait for the next poll. Conditional GET Issues First, a refresher on how this should work. When a server returns a Last-Modified header, the client should return that exact same string in follow-up requests in an If-Modified-Since header. The server then looks at the If-Modified-Since header and decides to either return a 200 plus the feed — if it has been modified since — or return a 304 Not Modified response and an empty body. It’s the same story with the Etag header. The client should save it and return it in follow-up requests in an If-None-Match header. This is great because it can save a ton of bandwidth, which is great for server and app alike. And NetNewsWire’s been doing this since the early 2000s. But clearly there’s a bug! In some cases, NetNewsWire is not picking up and saving the changed Last-Modified and Etag headers. Sometimes it does, and sometimes it keeps using whatever it already had and ignores the new ones. What could account for this? Let’s look at the logic. Feed processing logic Here’s what happens when a feed download completes without errors and the content is non-empty: First we check the hash of the raw feed data against the hash of the raw feed data the last time it actually changed. If those hashes match, then the app stops processing, because the feed hasn’t changed: it’s exactly the same as last time. This is an optimization that deals with the fact that many servers unfortunately don’t support conditional GET. It allows the app to skip feed parsing and updating the database. Saves a bunch of work. Good for battery life. If the hashes don’t match, then processing continues: it parses the feed and then sends the parsed articles to the code that updates the database. After that it updates and saves the hash of the raw feed data, and finally it stores the conditional GET info — it saves any Last-Modified and Etag header values to send with the next request. This isn’t actually the code, but it’s what the logic looks like: downloadDidComplete(httpResponse, feed, feedData) hash = feedData.md5 if hash == feed.previousHash then return parsedFeed = parse(feedData) updateDatabase(feed, parsedFeed) feed.previousHash = hash feed.conditionalGetInfo = conditionalGetInfoFromResponse(httpResponse) My theory There’s a great chance you’ve already spotted what I think is the issue: it’s that optimization where we check the hash of the raw feed data and return if it matches the previous hash. Here’s what I think has happened in some of the tests: the raw feed data was unchanged, but one or both of the Last-Modified and Etag header values did change. NetNewsWire never picked up the changes to those headers, because that code didn’t run — it had already bailed when it saw that the raw feed data was unchanged. The assumption I made when I wrote this code was that if the raw feed data was unchanged then of course the Last-Modified and Etag header values would be unchanged too, so there was no need to check to see if they were new. And I think that in real-world situations this is probably true pretty much all the time, and it’s only in tests like this where my assumption wouldn’t be true. But I can’t say that for sure! This is a real bug, and we’ll fix it and add a test or tests to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Here’s what the new logic should look like: downloadDidComplete(httpResponse, feedData, feed) hash = feedData.md5 if hash != feed.previousHash { parsedFeed = parse(feedData) updateDatabase(feed, parsedFeed) feed.previousHash = hash } feed.conditionalGetInfo = conditionalGetInfoFromResponse(httpResponse) With the above logic, conditionalGetInfo gets updated no matter what. PS There could be other bugs My theory does point to a bug that should get fixed. But is it the only bug? Is it even the bug that causes the issues in these tests? Though I’m pretty confident that this is the bug — seems pretty obvious, right? — more investigation and testing is warranted.",

It’s due to my changing settings in my blog generator. Pages now have a .html suffix where before they had none. This change impacts permalinks, which also changes the guids in my RSS feed — and NetNewsWire and other RSS readers use the guid property to identify articles, which means these will show up as new articles.
