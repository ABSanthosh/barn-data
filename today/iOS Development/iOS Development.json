    "link": "https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=awedznci",
    "description": "The European Commission has required Apple to make a series of additional changes under the Digital Markets Act:Communication and promotion of offers Today, we’re introducing updated terms that let developers with apps in the European Union storefronts of the App Store communicate and promote offers for purchase of digital goods or services available at a destination of their choice. The destination can be a website, alternative app marketplace, or another app, and can be accessed outside the app or within the app via a web view or native experience. App Store apps that communicate and promote offers for digital goods or services will be subject to new business terms for those transactions — an initial acquisition fee, store services fee, and for apps on the StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement (EU) Addendum, the Core Technology Commission (CTC). The CTC reflects value Apple provides developers through ongoing investments in the tools, technologies, and services that enable them to build and share innovative apps with users. Music streaming apps on the App Store in the European Economic Area (EEA) wanting to use the Music Streaming Services Entitlement (EEA) can use these options. Update to Business Terms for Apps in the European Union By January 1, 2026, Apple plans to move to a single business model in the EU for all developers. Under this single business model, Apple will transition from the Core Technology Fee (CTF) to the CTC on digital goods or services. The CTC will apply to digital goods or services sold by apps distributed from the App Store, Web Distribution, and/or alternative marketplaces. Apps currently under the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU continue to be subject only to the CTF until the transition to the CTC is fully implemented next year. At that time, qualifying transactions will be subject to the CTC, and the CTF will no longer apply. Additional details regarding this transition will be provided at a later date. User Experience Update Beginning with iOS 18.6 and iPadOS 18.6, iOS and iPadOS will provide an updated user experience in the EU for installing alternative marketplaces or apps from a developer’s website. Additionally, later this year, we will provide an API which will allow developers to initiate the download of alternatively distributed apps they publish from within their app. To learn more, view Communication and promotion of offers on the App Store in the EU. To read the full terms, view the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU or the StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement Addendum for EU Apps. You can also request a 30-minute online appointment to ask questions and provide feedback about these changes.",

    "description": "Colleen and I were binge-watching Gossip Girl last winter, and there are a few scenes where a stressed and irate Blair Waldorf wanders over to Central Park to feed the ducks. I told Colleen, \"that sounds soothing — we should do that when the weather gets better\". And then, as I’m wont to do, I promptly forgot. But Colleen takes note of moments like that, and a few months later she reminded me: we should actually go feed some ducks. That’s how I found myself in Central Park last weekend, feeding ducks. It was the first beautiful day of spring in New York — the kind of day New Yorkers wait for, when everyone pours out to enjoy sunlight finally breaking through after a long dark winter. We had a picnic, strolled through the park, wandered amidst thousands of New Yorkers — and of course, we fed the ducks. My wife (who I should preface is an extremely kind, caring, and loving person) and I got into a small debate over what kind of bread to feed the ducks. I insisted on buying them a nice loaf, and she felt it was unnecessary — the ducks would happily take our scraps. I argued that buying a good loaf cost us very little but could potentially make their day. Heck, it could even possibly be the best meal they ever have. She replied that there’s no way to know if they’d even notice the difference — to them, it might just be one carb versus another. Three Philosphers Interject I bought the dang bread, and she didn’t mind. I spent the whole afternoon thinking about that moment, and why it meant so much to me. In the end, I came back to three philosophers and their philosophies.",

    "description": "How do you use Icon Composer to add App Icons to an Xcode project? Last updated: Jun 26, 2025 Icon Composer Xcode 26 adds a new Icon Composer tool to build icons for the new Liquid Glass design system. I recommend the Apple Article: Creating your app icon using Icon Composer and the WWDC videos linked below to learn how to best use Icon Composer. The basic idea is that you use your preferred design tool (Photoshop, Sketch, Pixelmator, etc.) to design your icon’s foreground layers. You then export these as fully opaque SVG layers to import into Icon Composer. Using Icon Composer, you add the background, adjust size and positions of the layers, set opacity, color/gradients, shadows, and glass effects. Xcode uses the single .icon file to generate all the icon variants it needs for all supported platforms. Adding Icons to an Xcode Project The step that left me confused when watching the WWDC video was how to add the icons to an Xcode project. You no longer need to add default, dark, and tinted variants of the app icon to the asset catalog in the app bundle. What you need to do is drag the Icon Composer .icon file into the project navigator sidebar of the Xcode project: Once you add the .icon file to the project you no longer need the external file. You can open and edit the icon file in Icon Composer directly from Xcode: I would prefer that we could avoid this two step process. Maybe Apple will add an Icon Composer template to Xcode so we can create a new icon file directly in the project (FB18297643). One final step, in your app target settings, make sure the App Icon Set Name matches the name of the Icon Composer icon file name (without the .icon extension): What About Alternate App Icons? One thing that is missing is support for alternate app icons. I expected to be able to add alternate app icons to the project using Icon Composer. For example, if I create a purple variant of the icon named AppIcon-purple.icon and add it to the project: That should be enough for Xcode to generate the icons (making sure to have “Include all app icon assets” enabled in the build settings - see above). Unfortunately, setting the alternate icon name fails: UIApplication.shared.setAlternateIconName(\"AppIcon-purple\") Investigating some reports from people that claimed to have it working I decided to compare what Xcode generates when I add the app icons to the asset catalog. This is what I see in the Info.plist: Adding those keys to the Info.plist of the target fixes the problem. Note that the ~ipad variant seems to be necessary for it to work on the iPad. Hopefully Apple fixes this in a future Xcode release (FB18233873). Backwards Compatibility One other problem I’ve seen is icons not rendering correctly on older iOS releases. For example, on iOS 16.4 the background is not rendered. This looks like a known issue, the workaround being to keep the asset catalog icons: Icon Composer icons back deploy to older versions of iOS, macOS, and watchOS with inconsistent rendering. (152258860) Workaround: Keep the previous Asset Catalog app icon in your project until this issue is resolved.

    "description": "My WWDC 2025 viewing guide to help you plan the sessions you want to watch. Where Do I Start? The two big themes for the year are Liquid Glass design and Apple Intelligence. Start by watching the Platforms State of the Union (SOTU) for a summary of what’s new this year. You don’t have to learn everything new today! There are over 100 sessions and a lot of new stuff to learn. You may feel like you’re getting left behind. Don’t let it overwhelm you. You’ve got time. Don’t burn yourself out trying to keep up. Watching The Sessions I watch the videos using the Apple Developer app. It’s available on macOS and iOS. The video player supports from 0.5x to 2x playback, most videos have transcripts, some have summaries, and allow copying of the onscreen sample code. You can also watch on YouTube. There are a lot of sessions, but many are short (10-20 minutes). There’s no padding and Apple’s engineers get to the point quickly. Swift Swift 6.2 is here with some updates to ease the pain of adopting Swift Concurrency: What’s new in Swift Install toolchains with Swiftly. Faster clean builds for macros with pre-built swift-syntax dependencies. Finer controls for compiler diagnostics/warnings. Concrete notification types. New Observation type for tracking changes. Testing attachments and exit tests. InlineArray and Span types. Swift 6.2 is single-threaded by default. Opt-in to infer main actor. Improve memory usage and perforamce with Swift Profile a test to find performance issues. Just because it’s shorter, doesn’t mean it’s faster. Reduce allocations and copying. Exclusivity checks. InlineArray fixed size array. Span types to work with contiguous memory. Swift Binary Parsing library. These Swift Concurrency sessions are essential viewing. This seems like a better Concurrency approach: Embracing Swift concurrency Start by running code on the main thread. Introduce concurrency as you need it. Swift 6.2 allows a module to default to main-actor isolation. Use async tasks to await for data. Interleaving - single thread alternating between tasks. Run code on a background thread by marking method with @concurrent. Use nonisolated for library API and let client decide. Actors to move data off main thread. Enable Approachable Concurrency and Default Actor Isolation build settings. Code-along: Elevate an app with Swift concurrency Transform a single-threaded app to use concurrency as needed. Explore concurrency in SwiftUI SwiftUI views are isolated to the main actor. Tasks in the view run on the main actor. Find the boundaries between your UI code and non-UI code. Default actor isolation setting removes need for most @MainActor annotations. Interoperability with C, C++, and Java: Safely mix C, C++, and Swift Strict memory safety build setting, off by default. Annotate C and C++ functions and types so Swift can use them safely. Explore Swift and Java interoperability Incremental adoption of Swift by mixing Swift and Java code.

Search as a dedicated view. Control sizes are larger. UIGlassEffect. iPadOS A good year for iPadOS bringing macOS style windowing and menu bars to the platform: Make your UIKit app more flexible Best practises to make your app adapt across sizes and platforms. Adopt UIScene life cycle - mandatory in next major release. New trait to determine if parent split view is collapsed. Split view support for Inspector column. UISceneSizeRestrictions to set preferred minimum size. Scenes on iPadOS have macOS style window controls. Use layout guide to keep content clear. UIRequiresFullScreen is deprecated and will be ignored in a future release. Apps will no longer be scaled for new screen sizes. AppKit Build an AppKit app with the new design Rebuild with Xcode 26 to get the Liquid Glass design. Use NSSplitViewController for new glass sidebar, removing any visual effects from sidebar. NSBackgroundExtensionView to mirror and extend content. New larger control sizes and corner radius. Add icons to menu items. watchOS What’s new in watchOS 26 New toolbar and control styles.

Get to know the new design system Adjusted System colors for Liquid Glass. Alert Text is left-aligned. Concentricity aligns radii so shapes nest. Larger controls use capsule shapes. Sheets spring from an action source. Remove custom backgrounds from controls. Primary action stays separate and tinted. Hard scroll edge effect on macOS for stronger boundary. Bars rely more on symbols, see HIG for glyphs for common actions. Design foundations from idea to interface Start with app structure. Where am I? What can I do? Where can I go from here? Use toolbar for screen specific actions. Progressive disclosure. Group by time, progress or patterns. Use a cohesive visual style. Design is never really finished. Make a big impact with small writing changes Simplify. Too many filler adverbs and adjectives. Does each word add value. Don’t apologise for errors. Avoid repetition.

Machine Learning and Apple Intelligence An API to access an on-device Large Language Model (LLM) was high on everyone’s wish list: Meet the Foundation Models framework API access to Apple’s LLM. On-device so data stays private and can run offline. Experiment with prompts using the new Playground feature in Xcode. On-device model not intended for world knowledge or advanced reasoning. Adapters for common tasks. Use @Generable and @Guide to define Swift type that models returns. Streams partially generated types. Model can callout to tools you define. Session instructions get priority over user prompts. Context is retained during a session. Only available where Apple Intelligence is available. Deep dive into the Foundation Models framework Session throws error when it reaches available context size. Create new session with extract or summary from previous session to provide context. Greedy sampling produces deterministic output. Check for supported languages. @Generable macro defines structured schema for responses. Constrained decoding forces model to return valid tokens for the schema. String properties can use a regex pattern guide. Tool protocol to define functions model can call to access external data. Explore prompt design \u0026 safety for on-device foundation models On-device LLM has ~3-billion parameters, small when compared to cloud based models. May need to break down complex prompts. Avoid maths, code, or tasks requiring real world knowledge. Avoid where facts are critical or provide verified information in prompt. Use prompts like “in a few words” or “in detail” to control output. Provide model with a role. Ask a single, detailed task. Less than five examples in prompt. Use “DO NOT”. Apple designed guardrails to block harmful inputs and throw safety errors. Use instructions to steer model output. Never include user input in instructions.

    "description": "I wrote in my love letter to my colleagues at Audible that retirement is coming up — and now it’s here. Today’s the day! I’ve attended my last meetings. I’ve said my goodbyes. My laptop’s ready to ship back to Audible HQ. * * * I started working in 1984, while in high school, busing tables part time at Schaefers Canal House in Chesapeake City, MD. And I stopped working this day in 2025, almost 41 years later, as a senior engineer (which is surprisingly a lot like busing tables — lots of cleanup and setting the table just right for the customers to have a great time). Along the way I worked on, among other apps, Userland Frontier, NetNewsWire, MarsEdit, Glassboard, Vesper, OmniFocus, OmniOutliner, and Audible. * * * My immediate plan — Exhale! Breathe. Enjoy a steak. Watch WWDC from the comfort of home next week. Get back to work on NetNewsWire. 🌲",
