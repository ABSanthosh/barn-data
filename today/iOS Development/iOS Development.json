    "description": "For iOS, Accessibility values are one of the building blocks of how Accessibility works on the platform, along with traits, labels, hints, and showing/hiding elements. If you’re familiar with WCAG or web accessibility, accessibility values are the value part of WCAG 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value. Values Not every element in your view will have a value - in fact, most won’t. Any element that ‘contains’ some data, data that is not included in the element’s label requires an accessibility value to be set.",

The exact experience will vary between assistive technologies, in some cases they may change the intonation of what VoiceOver reads, or add additional options for navigation, sometimes they will disable that assistive technology from accessing the element, or change how the assistive tech functions.

    "description": "I. I once knew a wonderful man. He was kind, gentle, and beloved by many. He was so wise that when he graduated from college, Mahatma Gandhi himself handed him his diploma. He was a scholar and a gentleman, blessed with the unique gift of deeply knowing Sanskrit and Hindi. He spent much of his life translating scrolls filled with the wisdom of the ancients into modern language — in pursuit of preserving history. II. When Mongol troops raided the House of Wisdom and dumped so many manuscripts into the Tigris that “the river ran black with ink”, Muslim chroniclers equated the loss of knowledge to a civilizational catastrophe. Many of the books in the Grand Library of Baghdad were torn apart by pillagers so their leather covers could be made into sandals — compounding the pain of an already destructive act. III. In 1969, three astronauts planted an American flag on the moon. This event was captured on film and beamed to millions of household television sets, as people across the world shared the experience of witnessing a profound leap for mankind. Our connection to the cosmos had been reshaped — and we still talk about it decades later. IV. Early internet phenomenons like Charlie the Unicorn, Potter Puppet Pals, and Peanut Butter Jelly Time provided endless entertainment. My older brother introduced me to All Your Base Are Belong to Us, and I showed him lolcats. A few months later, I met a kid I considered sheltered because he’d never heard of Newgrounds — so I showed him everything it had to offer, and we relived the humor together. That rhythm of discovery and sharing lasted for years, as the internet grew at a pace that felt almost unthinkable compared to my early childhood.",

    "description": "Colleen and I were binge-watching Gossip Girl last winter, and there are a few scenes where a stressed and irate Blair Waldorf wanders over to Central Park to feed the ducks. I told Colleen, \"that sounds soothing — we should do that when the weather gets better\". And then, as I’m wont to do, I promptly forgot. But Colleen takes note of moments like that, and a few months later she reminded me: we should actually go feed some ducks. That’s how I found myself in Central Park last weekend, feeding ducks. It was the first beautiful day of spring in New York — the kind of day New Yorkers wait for, when everyone pours out to enjoy sunlight finally breaking through after a long dark winter. We had a picnic, strolled through the park, wandered amidst thousands of New Yorkers — and of course, we fed the ducks. My wife (who I should preface is an extremely kind, caring, and loving person) and I got into a small debate over what kind of bread to feed the ducks. I insisted on buying them a nice loaf, and she felt it was unnecessary — the ducks would happily take our scraps. I argued that buying a good loaf cost us very little but could potentially make their day. Heck, it could even possibly be the best meal they ever have. She replied that there’s no way to know if they’d even notice the difference — to them, it might just be one carb versus another. Three Philosphers Interject I bought the dang bread, and she didn’t mind. I spent the whole afternoon thinking about that moment, and why it meant so much to me. In the end, I came back to three philosophers and their philosophies.",

    "link": "https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ks775ehf",
    "description": "The App Store is designed to be a safe and trusted place for all ages, including children. The age rating system for apps and games has been updated in order to provide people with more granular age ratings. We’ve also introduced new age rating questions to help identify sensitive content in your app and added the ability to set a higher rating to reflect your app’s minimum age requirement. Ratings for all apps and games on the App Store have been automatically updated to align with this new system and will be reflected on Apple devices running beta versions of iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, and watchOS 26.The updated age rating system adds 13+, 16+, and 18+ to the existing 4+ and 9+ ratings. Age ratings are assigned to each country or region and may vary based on region-specific suitability standards.We’ve introduced a new set of required questions to the ratings questionnaire for all apps. These new questions cover: In-app controls. Capabilities. Medical or wellness topics. Violent themes in your app or game. Your answers to these questions will help Apple better calculate a rating and help you deliver an age-appropriate experience.If your app has a policy requiring a higher minimum user age than the rating assigned by Apple, you can set a higher age rating after you respond to the age ratings questions. You can view the age rating for each of your apps under the updated system and respond to the new questions for each app in the App Information section in App Store Connect.As a reminder, you must consider how all app features, including AI assistants and chatbot functionality, impact the frequency of sensitive content appearing within your app to make sure it receives the appropriate rating. All apps are subject to the App Review Guidelines, such as the safety guidelines regarding objectionable content or user generated content, and must abide by all applicable local laws and regulations, like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).Please provide responses to the updated age rating questions for each of your apps by January 31, 2026, to avoid an interruption when submitting your app updates in App Store Connect.Learn more about age ratings values and definitionsLearn how to set your app rating",

    "description": "Xcode 26 ships with Swift 6.2 and enables Approachable Concurrency. How do you adopt it in existing projects and in Swift Packages? What is Approachable Concurrency? In Swift 6.2 Apple is introducing a new more approachable way to use Swift Concurrency. It starts with the assumption that you start by running your app’s code on the main thread and only move work to a background thread when needed. I highly recommend watching the session video WWDC25 Embracing Swift concurrency and/or reading the Swift Evolution proposals to learn more: SE-0461 Run nonisolated async functions on the caller’s actor by default SE-0466 Control default actor isolation inference SE-0470 Global-actor isolated conformances Enabling in Xcode 26 Creating a new project with Xcode 26 enables MainActor default isolation and approachable concurrency by default. For an existing project you opt-in by changing the build settings for a target: Enabling Approachable Concurrency enables a couple of extra upcoming features: The Infer Isolated Conformances setting enables SE-0470 (upcoming feature flag InferIsolatedConformances). The nonIsolated(nonsending) By Default setting enables SE-0461 (upcoming feature flag NonisolatedNonsendingByDefault). The other concurrency features are enabled with Swift 6. Using in a Swift Package You can apply the build settings for approachable concurrency and default actor isolation to one or more targets in your Swift Package. You need to update the swift tools version to 6.2 (first line of Package.swift): // swift-tools-version: 6.2 To set the Default Actor Isolation (SE-0466) for a target, there’s a new swiftSettings option: .target( name: \"MyFeature\", swiftSettings: [ .defaultIsolation(MainActor.self) ] ) To enable approachable concurrency, add the upcoming feature flags for both SE-0461 and SE-0470: .target( name: \"MyFeature\", swiftSettings: [ .defaultIsolation(MainActor.self), .enableUpcomingFeature(\"NonisolatedNonsendingByDefault\"), .enableUpcomingFeature(\"InferIsolatedConformances\") ] ) If you want to apply the settings to all targets, including test targets, add the following to the bottom of your Package.swift file: for target in package.targets { var settings = target.swiftSettings ?? [] settings.append(contentsOf: [ .defaultIsolation(MainActor.self), .enableUpcomingFeature(\"NonisolatedNonsendingByDefault\"), .enableUpcomingFeature(\"InferIsolatedConformances\") ]) target.swiftSettings = settings } Initial Experiences I’m writing this post using Xcode 26 beta 3 and I would say this is still a work-in-progress. One common issue is with protocols like CodingKey which expect to be nonisolated: struct AppSettings: Codable { let name: String private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey { case name } ... } That generates a compiler warning: Conformance of ‘AppSettings.CodingKeys’ to protocol ‘CodingKey’ crosses into main actor-isolated code and can cause data races You can workaround it by marking the enum as nonisolated but a permanent fix is on the way. I’ve also seen issues when the generated Bundle.module becomes isolated to @MainActor by default.

I recommend the Apple Article: Creating your app icon using Icon Composer and the WWDC videos linked below to learn how to best use Icon Composer. The basic idea is that you use your preferred design tool (Photoshop, Sketch, Pixelmator, etc.) to design your icon’s foreground layers. You then export these as fully opaque SVG layers to import into Icon Composer. Using Icon Composer, you add the background, adjust size and positions of the layers, set opacity, color/gradients, shadows, and glass effects. Xcode uses the single .icon file to generate all the icon variants it needs for all supported platforms. Adding Icons to an Xcode Project The step that left me confused when watching the WWDC video was how to add the icons to an Xcode project. You no longer need to add default, dark, and tinted variants of the app icon to the asset catalog in the app bundle. What you need to do is drag the Icon Composer .icon file into the project navigator sidebar of the Xcode project: Once you add the .icon file to the project you no longer need the external file. You can open and edit the icon file in Icon Composer directly from Xcode: I would prefer that we could avoid this two step process. Maybe Apple will add an Icon Composer template to Xcode so we can create a new icon file directly in the project (FB18297643). One final step, in your app target settings, make sure the App Icon Set Name matches the name of the Icon Composer icon file name (without the .icon extension): What About Alternate App Icons? One thing that is missing is support for alternate app icons. I expected to be able to add alternate app icons to the project using Icon Composer. For example, if I create a purple variant of the icon named AppIcon-purple.icon and add it to the project: That should be enough for Xcode to generate the icons (making sure to have “Include all app icon assets” enabled in the build settings - see above). Unfortunately, setting the alternate icon name fails: UIApplication.shared.setAlternateIconName(\"AppIcon-purple\") Investigating some reports from people that claimed to have it working I decided to compare what Xcode generates when I add the app icons to the asset catalog. This is what I see in the Info.plist: Adding those keys to the Info.plist of the target fixes the problem. Note that the ~ipad variant seems to be necessary for it to work on the iPad. Hopefully Apple fixes this in a future Xcode release (FB18233873). Backwards Compatibility One other problem I’ve seen is icons not rendering correctly on older iOS releases. For example, on iOS 16.4 the background is not rendered. This looks like a known issue, the workaround being to keep the asset catalog icons: Icon Composer icons back deploy to older versions of iOS, macOS, and watchOS with inconsistent rendering. (152258860) Workaround: Keep the previous Asset Catalog app icon in your project until this issue is resolved.
