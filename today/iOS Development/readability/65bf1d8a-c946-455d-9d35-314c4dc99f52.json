Thatâ€™s rare enough to forget how I solved it, but frequent enough to waste 15 minutes rediscovering the answer. And letâ€™s be honest: itâ€™s not the big problems that drive you mad â€” itâ€™s the little ones that feel like their own Sisyphean hell. The Problem Some websites 1 require you to log in using a magic link â€” a one-time link emailed to you that signs you in when clicked. Itâ€™s usually seamless. But on iOS, it can quietly become a headache. 2 If you open the link in your default browser, everythingâ€™s fine â€” no issue at all. But I do most of my reading in my RSS app, Reeder. When I run into a short-form RSS feed 3, Iâ€™ll tap to open the article in SafariViewController â€” the in-app browser you see in apps like Reeder, or my own app, Plinky. Itâ€™s an easy way to read the full article in a browser without leaving the app youâ€™re already in. The Problem (Simplified) I open a link to paywalled content, like the excellent tech newsletter I subscribe to: platformer.news. Platformerâ€™s hosting provider, Ghost, emails me a magic link to log in and access the content I pay for. But thereâ€™s no way to open that sign-in link inside Reederâ€™s SafariViewController. If I click the link, it opens in the iOS default browser â€” and thereâ€™s no way to force it to open in Reederâ€™s SafariViewController instead. 4 I canâ€™t even copy and paste the link, since SafariViewController has no address bar. The Solution Every time I run into this issue, I end up coming back to the only solution that actually works. My favorite RSS provider, Feedbin, has a clever feature: it lets you generate a unique email address (like [emailÂ protected]) that turns incoming emails into an RSS feed. 5 Itâ€™s meant for forwarding email newsletters into your RSS reader â€” a nice way to keep all your reading in one place. But in a pinch, itâ€™s also a great trick for accessing any email inside your feed. I canâ€™t tell Platformer to send the magic link directly to that Feedbin address, because my login is tied to my personal email â€” but I can forward the email there myself. Since Iâ€™m already subscribed to that email-based RSS feed, the message shows up in Reeder. Now I can tap the login link in Reeder, which opens SafariViewController â€” and just like that, Iâ€™m signed in. ðŸŒŸ Finally, I can read the paywalled content I actually paid for! ðŸŒŸ Conclusion While I hope this post helps someone else out there, letâ€™s be honest â€” itâ€™s really written for me, 12 months from now, when Iâ€™ve forgotten all of this again. ðŸ˜’ Joe Fabisevich is an indie developer creating software at Red Panda Club Inc. while writing about design, development, and building a company.
