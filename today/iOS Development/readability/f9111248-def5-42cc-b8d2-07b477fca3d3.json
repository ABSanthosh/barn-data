  "text": "I recently discovered minifeed, and it has quickly become one of my favorite things on the internet. Minifeed is a curated blog reader and search engine. We collect humans-written blogs to make them discoverable and searchable. Once, maybe twice a day, I load the homepage and browse through the latest posts from real blogs written by real humans. I almost always find something surprising, delightful, weird, or just plain fun to read. Even better, I come away with a new blogger to follow. From the minifeed About page, there is a self-imposed deadline to decide if the service is worth maintaining: I have been building and using Minifeed since December 2023 (see changelog). I will launch it publicly by the end of 2024, allow paid subscriptions, and keep actively working on it for 1 year (until end of 2025). In December 2025 I will make a public announcement choosing between one of 3 options: Given enough interest and support from users, continue to develop and maintain Minifeed for the long term. Given little, but not enough interest, run it for as long as the money lasts. Given no interest, shut it down and allow users to download all their data in a simple, usable format. I sure hope they start charging soon. I’d love to see the service last.",
