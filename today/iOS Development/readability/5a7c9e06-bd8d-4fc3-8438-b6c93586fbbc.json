  "description": "The App Store is designed to make it easy to sell your digital goods and services globally, with support for 44 currencies across 175 storefronts.From time to time, we may need to adjust prices or your proceeds due to changes in tax regulations or foreign exchange rates. These adjustments are made using publicly available exchange rate information from financial data providers to help make sure prices for Apps and In-App Purchases stay consistent across all storefronts.Tax and price updatesAs of May 16:Your proceeds from the sale of eligible apps and In‑App Purchases have been modified in Brazil to account for the Contribuições de Intervenção no Domínio Econômico (CIDE) tax introduction of 10% for developers based outside of Brazil.Beginning June 2:Pricing for apps and In-App Purchases will be updated for Brazil and Kazakhstan if you haven’t selected one of these storefronts as the base storefront for your app or In‑App Purchase.¹ The updates in Brazil also consider the 10% CIDE tax introduction. If you’ve selected Brazil or Kazakhstan as the base storefront for your app or In-App Purchase, prices won’t change. On other storefronts, prices will be updated to maintain equalization with your chosen base price.Prices won’t change in any region if your In‑App Purchase is an auto‑renewable subscription. Prices also won’t change on the storefronts where you manually manage prices instead of using the automated equalized prices.The Pricing and Availability section of Apps has been updated in App Store Connect to display these upcoming price changes. As always, you can change the prices of your apps, In‑App Purchases, and auto‑renewable subscriptions at any time.Additional upcoming changesBeginning August 4:All auto-renewable subscription price increases in Austria, Germany, and Poland will require customers to consent to the new price for their subscription to continue renewing. Price increases scheduled with a start date on or after August 4: All customers must consent to the new price. If a subscriber doesn’t agree to the new price or takes no action, Apple will continue to request consent approximately weekly through email, push notifications, and in-app messaging until their subscription expires at the end of their current billing cycle. Price increases scheduled with a start date before August 4: Current notice criteria will remain in effect, even if the renewal occurs after August 4 (for annual subscriptions, renewal could be as late as August 2026). See criteria, noting that consent may apply to customers depending on the size or velocity of your price increases. To help ensure a smooth transition, we recommend avoiding scheduling price increases with a start date between August 2 and August 4.Learn more about managing your pricesView or edit upcoming price changesEdit your app’s base country or regionPricing and availability start times by country or regionSet a price for an In-App PurchaseLearn more about your proceedsView payments and proceedsDownload financial reports¹ Excludes auto-renewable subscriptions.",
