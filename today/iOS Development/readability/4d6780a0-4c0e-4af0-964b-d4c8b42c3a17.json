On a daily basis, I spend a lot of time debugging and I am usually using several LLDB commands over and over again. For this purpose, I have defined a couple of custom LLDB commands like printing out the contents of Data as String - so instead of po String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8) I simply write printData jsonData Since not many devs know about the opportunity to define own custom LLDB aliases or commands, I have put together a short video: (Fun fact: The video was made with Keynote which I found quite useful for such task) The example of .lldbinit file can be seen on my gist. Stay safe!",
