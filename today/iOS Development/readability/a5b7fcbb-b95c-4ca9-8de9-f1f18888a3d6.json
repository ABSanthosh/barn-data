  "description": "Lindsay and Steve talk to Mike Gallagher, Software Architect at Hip eCommerce, about his blog post exploring server-side rendering and how Nuxt functions under the hood. They explore Mike's specific use case of needing to manage routing on the client, rather than the server, and how he was able to find a solution. They also discuss how Mike approaches difficult problems like this, and how he determines the next steps to find a solution. They explore some of the intricate details of Nuxt, including how Mike's company handles caching with Nuxt and other production use cases.
