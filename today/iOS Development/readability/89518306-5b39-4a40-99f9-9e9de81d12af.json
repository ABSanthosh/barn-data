That's when I remembered the humble Twitter carousel. You may have seen carousels serving you ads for apps or services that everyone is excited about like‚Ä¶ VMWare Cloud. But did you know that Twitter's advertiser tools are available to everyone, without having to pay a penny? 1 That's right, you a regular Twitter user can have the same capabilities as a company that pays Twitter millions of dollars per year. I'm going to show you how to take advantage of them so you can stand out just like household brands such as Disney, Nike, and of course‚Ä¶ VMWare. Who's That Handsome Guy? About Me About Me‚Äî ‚ú® Ó®Ä Joe Fabisevich Ó®Ä ‚ú® (@mergesort) February 19, 2022 I've always debated whether my bio should link to my home page, my About Me page, or the best posts I've written. Thanks to the carousel I no longer have to choose, and I'm able to put all three front and center. The flexibility of having six links means I can also guide people to the office hours I host, and have room to spare for another link or two.2 As importantly as taking the time to construct the tweet is remembering to pin it, that way anyone who comes to my Twitter account has this information visible immediately. Do you love red pandas? Love apps? Find out more about what we do!‚Äî The Red Panda Club (@redpandaclub) February 19, 2022 A brand can get really creative by linking to their homepage, their support page3, FAQs, App Store apps, and a whole lot more. The carousel is also a medium to play with, you can use custom artwork to show off your brand's style, which in my case is playful and silly. I created a tweet carousel for my indie development company Red Panda Club as a proof of concept, and pinned it to the top of the @redpandaclub Twitter account. Building Your Carousel The process for building your own Twitter carousel is hidden away, but surprisingly easy. Head over to ads.twitter.com and look in the navigation bar for a menu titled Creatives. Under Creatives you'll find a menu item titled Tweet Composer, this is unsurprisingly what you'll want to compose tweets. The URL will look something like ads.twitter.com / composer / XXXXX /carousel, where the XXXXX will be a random set of letters and numbers. You may run into various popups asking for more information, feel free to ignore ‚Äòem! The only popup you‚Äôll see that you have to fill out is one asking you to setup a payment method and campaign to unlock a Creatives menu. 1 (You really don't have to pay Twitter anything to use the tools but you do need to have a credit card on file to use the Ads Tweet Composer.) And that's actually it, there's no real step 2 beyond composing your tweet. But to save you some time I'll mention a few things that may seem unintuitive. A) Your first step for customizing the carousel is to add media. You can't start creating a card by updating the website destination; that will only appear after you've chosen media for your carousel. B) Website cards can customize the text that displays under a card's image, but app cards always display the app name and app category under the image. C) You‚Äôll be asked to choose an app carousel or a web carousel, but don‚Äôt let that think you can't make one that mixes the two together. To do this you'll need to choose a website carousel and for any app you want to add you'll use your app's App Store or Google Play URL and manually upload your app's icon. D) The Tweet Composer will default to making your tweet Promoted Only. If you want the composed tweet to show up on your profile timeline remember to uncheck the Promoted Only checkbox. It's worth noting that a Promoted Tweet is a real tweet, but you‚Äôll only be able to find the tweet‚Äôs URL in the Twitter Ads dashboard. E) Cards do not render in third-party clients4, so if that's important to you I recommend including text and links in the body of the tweet. It doesn't look as good in native Twitter clients so it's your choice whether to prioritize this or not. Now that you know how to build a fun carousel, I'd love to see you get creative. I can't wait to see what kind you come up with. üé† Joe Fabisevich is an indie developer creating software at Red Panda Club Inc. while writing about design, development, and building a company.

But to save you some time I\u0026#39;ll mention a few things that may seem unintuitive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA) Your first step for customizing the carousel is to add media. You can\u0026#39;t start creating a card by updating the website destination; that will only appear after you\u0026#39;ve chosen media for your carousel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eB) Website cards can customize the text that displays under a card\u0026#39;s image, but app cards always display the app name and app category under the image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC) You‚Äôll be asked to choose an app carousel or a web carousel, but don‚Äôt let that think you can\u0026#39;t make one that mixes the two together. To do this you\u0026#39;ll need to choose a website carousel and for any app you want to add you\u0026#39;ll use your app\u0026#39;s App Store or Google Play URL and manually upload your app\u0026#39;s icon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eD) The Tweet Composer will default to making your tweet Promoted Only. If you want the composed tweet to show up on your profile timeline remember to uncheck the Promoted Only checkbox. It\u0026#39;s worth noting that a Promoted Tweet is a real tweet, but you‚Äôll only be able to find the tweet‚Äôs URL in the Twitter Ads dashboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eE) Cards do not render in third-party clients\u003csup id=\"fnref-4\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#fn-4\"\u003e4\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e, so if that\u0026#39;s important to you I recommend including text and links in the body of the tweet. It doesn\u0026#39;t look as good in native Twitter clients so it\u0026#39;s your choice whether to prioritize this or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that you know how to build a fun carousel, I\u0026#39;d love to see you get creative. I can\u0026#39;t wait to see what kind you come up with. üé†\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eJoe Fabisevich is an indie developer creating software at \u003ca href=\"https://redpanda.club\"\u003eRed Panda Club Inc.\u003c/a\u003e while writing about design, development, and building a company.
