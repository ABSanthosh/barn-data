  "description": "Steve and Solomon talk to Henry Eze about Hygen. Hygen is a generic file generator that allows you to dynamically generate files, such as Vue templates, tests, and any other file needed in a project. In addition, they talk about Docuvaluate, an AI-based program Henry is working on that is used to evaluate contract language and structure. As always, they wrap up the show with picks, including Steveâ€™s famous dad jokes of the week.
