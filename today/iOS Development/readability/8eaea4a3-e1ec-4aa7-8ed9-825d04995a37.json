It’s more than can fit into the narrow width of a side panel, and I’m not a fan of giant iWork-style modal sheets. These new fiddly settings are like the “inner workings” of the TextBuddy document you’re editing, which gave me the idea of having those settings “inside” the window itself. If I complain that modern software is too generic and boring, I should take my own advice and try something fun and borderline silly. And while I’m thinking of it, if you’ve never used TextBuddy or my other app Fastmarks, here are two screen recordings showing their About windows. (About windows are magical places that, in the best cases, tell you something about the people who built an app rather than just the company name and version number.)",
