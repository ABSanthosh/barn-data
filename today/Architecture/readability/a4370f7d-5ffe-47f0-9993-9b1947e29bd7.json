  "text": "Architizer is thrilled to welcome Lyndon Neri, Hon. FAIA, co-founder of 2023 Firm of the Year Neri\u0026Hu Design and Research Office, to the jury for the 2025 Vision Awards. As one of the most respected voices in contemporary architecture and design, Neri brings a deeply interdisciplinary perspective that aligns powerfully with the program’s celebration of conceptual rigor and visual innovation. To have your work seen by Neri and secure a place in the running for global publication this year, Architizer cordially invites you to submit your best architectural concepts, images and ideas to this year’s Vision Awards: Share My Vision Based in Shanghai and working globally, Architizer’s 2023 Firm of the Year Neri\u0026Hu is known for its boundary-defying approach to design — where architecture, interiors and product design are all treated as part of a singular, research-driven narrative. With a stunning portfolio of richly layered cultural projects, Neri\u0026Hu’s work expresses a commitment to contextual storytelling and material exploration at every scale. The firm’s projects are recognized not just for their aesthetic sensitivity, but for the conceptual clarity that underpins each spatial gesture. Educated at the University of California, Berkeley and the Harvard Graduate School of Design, Neri is equally celebrated as an educator and theorist. In recent years, he has held prominent teaching positions at Harvard, Yale, Berkeley and Princeton, where he was appointed as Visiting Faculty in 2024. His editorial and written contributions — including Persistence of Vision: Shanghai Architects in Dialogue and Neri\u0026Hu’s monograph Thresholds: Space, Time and Practice — have helped frame an emergent dialogue around contemporary Asian architecture and its role in global discourse. Neri’s presence on the 2025 Vision Awards Jury is particularly exciting given the program’s expansive exploration of architectural ideation across every medium. Categories for architectural drawings, models, renderings and conceptual designs all speak directly to Neri’s longstanding interest in the process and craft of architecture, from concept to construction. His insights will undoubtedly help shape a new generation of design thinking through this year’s program. Neri joins a stellar judging panel that includes fellow architectural luminaries such as Daniel Libeskind, Steven Holl, Winka Dubbeldam and Suchi Reddy — all united in the search for the most inspiring architectural ideas and visual work from around the world. Entries for the 2025 Vision Awards are open, with a Main Entry Deadline of June 6th, 2025. Winners will be featured in Architizer’s Visionary 100, a definitive guide to the architecture industry’s most innovative creators, and see their work published on Architizer’s new book How to Visualize Architecture. Think you belong among them? Take part in the Vision Awards and show the world your boldest architectural visions!
