  "text": "June 10, 2025 Central Bark, designed by Chrissy Fehan for DARRAN, is a workspace solution that quietly rethinks what office furniture can be, especially in pet-friendly workplaces. At its core, it’s a modern desk system with clean lines and warm materials. What sets it apart is a built-in pet nook, integrated directly into the design. Instead of an afterthought or a separate dog bed tucked under the desk, Central Bark includes a designated space for your dog from the start, a quiet, sheltered spot where they can rest nearby while you work. The idea is simple: many people bring their dogs to work, especially in more flexible or creative office environments. This design makes space for that reality without compromising the look or function of the furniture. It’s practical and low-key, not flashy or over-engineered. Central Bark also supports a more inclusive environment for people who rely on service animals, offering a workspace that accommodates both human and canine needs with minimal fuss. One thoughtful detail: the pet bed isn’t fixed in place. It can be brought forward to give your dog more space when they need it, and tucks neatly back in line with the edge of the desk when not in use. This keeps the overall footprint compact and the workspace looking tidy. Rather than reinventing the office, it’s a small but thoughtful shift, a reminder that good design can respond to how people actually live and work.",
