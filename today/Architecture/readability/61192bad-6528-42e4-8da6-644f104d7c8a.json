  "text": "a spiraling structure for a Brazilian homeA new residence designed by New York-based Brazilian architect Victor B. Ortiz is set to rise among the lush plantings of São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo. Envisioned as an immersive living environment, the 380-square-meter house responds to the clients’ wish for spaces that engage with the surrounding greenery while maintaining a calm interior order.A spiraling timber beam structure shapes the roofline, creating a visual rhythm that anchors the composition and allows light to enter from multiple directions. A generous skylight opens above an internal garden, drawing the eye upward and casting shifting patterns across the lime-washed walls and polished concrete floors. The corten steel staircase introduces a contrasting tone and texture, bringing a deliberate material presence into the heart of the plan.visualization © Victor B. Ortiz ArchitectureVictor ortiz ensures Continuity across all levelsArchitect Victor B. Ortiz gathers the primary social spaces of its São Paulo home into a continuous sequence along the ground floor. These include a living area, dining room, kitchen, and a reading nook that overlooks the garden. Each zone maintains a sense of connection to the outdoors, framed by floor-to-ceiling glazing that softens the boundary between inside and out.The upper level contains four suites and a home office arranged around the central void. Here, the spiral beams reveal their full geometry, radiating from the skylight to delineate private spaces without enclosing them completely. Glass partitions and open sightlines maintain a feeling of continuity across the plan.Furnishings adopt a restrained palette, supporting the architectural gestures without competing for attention. In the living room, custom seating groups rest on smooth concrete slabs, while low tables in brass and timber introduce warm accents. A small yoga deck opens to the landscape, offering a place of retreat within the overall composition.Victor Ortiz designs the residence as a 380-square-meter living environmenta spiral timber beam structure defines the expressive roof geometrypolished concrete floors and lime-washed walls create a calm backdropa central skylight brings light into the interior garden and main living spaces",
