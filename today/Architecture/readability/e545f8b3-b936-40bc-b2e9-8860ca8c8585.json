  "text": "C-O Lab reconstructs traditional 1955 cell on Serifos IslandC-O Lab’s Gremnos House project involves the reconstruction of a traditional cell, originally built before 1955, alongside the design of a main residence and an independent guesthouse in Serifos Island, Greece. The structures are integrated into a landscape characterized by geological formations, requiring careful placement on the site’s limited flat areas. The design approach prioritizes preserving the natural rock formations, with excavation conducted to minimize impact on the terrain.The main residence consists of two stone volumes connected by a smaller plastered volume. The first stone volume contains the living room, kitchen, and dining area, while the central connecting space accommodates the entrance, corridor, storage, and one of the two bathrooms. The second stone volume houses two bedrooms and an additional bathroom. The guesthouse, positioned at a lower level and separate from the main residence, follows a V-shaped layout with an obtuse angle. It aligns with the main residence’s central connecting space and includes a living area, kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom.all images by Vangelis PaterakisGremnos House follows the contours of rock formationsOutdoor spaces, including courtyards and terraces, follow the irregular contours of the rock formations, maintaining a strong relationship between built elements and the natural site. The restored cell retains its original character and functions as an additional living space with a bed, wardrobe, and bathroom. Its outdoor area includes a built-in kitchen and day bed, enclosed by semicircular walls referencing the layout of traditional cell courtyards.C-O Lab’s design team opts for a material palette that consists of exposed stone masonry, earth-toned plaster, cement mortar for floors and built-in structures, and chestnut wood combined with reed ceilings and pergolas. Wooden exterior frames are painted in a gray-brown shade to integrate with the stone, while interior doors and wardrobes were constructed from repurposed old doors and shutters. Fixed furniture, such as kitchens, was made from cement mortar and solid chestnut wood. The overall material and spatial composition establish a connection with traditional construction techniques while integrating contemporary living requirements.courtyards and terraces follow the site’s natural contours, integrating built and natural elementsGremnos House integrates traditional architecture with Serifos Island’s rugged geological formationchestnut wood and reed ceilings establish a connection with traditional construction techniquescement mortar floors and built-in structures create a cohesive interior-exterior aestheticthe spatial and material composition balances heritage preservation with contemporary designexposed stone masonry and earth-toned plaster define the project’s material palette",
