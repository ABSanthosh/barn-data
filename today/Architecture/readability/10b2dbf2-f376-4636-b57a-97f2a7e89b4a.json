  "text": "A New Vision for Coex with a reimagined facadeHeatherwick Studio has won the competition to redesign the Coex Convention Centre in Seoul, setting the stage for a major transformation of one of South Korea’s most significant conference and exhibition venues. In collaboration with the Korea International Trade Association (KITA), the studio aims to replace the existing generic glass structure with a dynamic and engaging space that reflects Seoul’s evolving identity.Currently, the Coex Convention Centre in Seoul spans 350 meters, but its current facade lacks distinctiveness and does not adequately represent its role as a hub for trade, culture, and innovation. Heatherwick Studio’s winning design introduces a fresh concept inspired by a ‘Cabinet of Curiosities,’ which will transform the venue into an interactive destination that draws visitors even outside of official events. Slated for completion in 2029, the Coex Convention Centre redesign adds to Heatherwick Studio’s growing portfolio in South Korea.the project will transform the existing glass structure into a dynamic cultural destination | images © Devisualheatherwick studio’s dynamic Architectural ApproachHeatherwick Studio’s proposal for the Coex Convention Centre in Seoul features modular ‘boxes’ of varying sizes stacked along the exterior, providing spaces for exhibitions, public engagement, and conference activities. With this innovative approach, the architects maximize material reuse while creating a visually compelling and accessible facade, a departure from the fortress-like appearance of the existing structure.Stuart Wood, Executive Partner and Group Leader at Heatherwick Studio, emphasized the project’s goal to redefine convention centres as lively cultural spaces. ‘Ironically for places that bring people together, most convention centres feel imposing and uninviting and are often devoid of public activity. Our design will radically reinvent Coex to become a new cultural destination for the city of Seoul that attracts both locals and visitors alike.‘Varied and unusual, our ‘display case’ design offers endless potential to curate art, performance, dining, entertainment, and nature, serving as a true representation of Seoul’s creative power. We want Coex to become an irresistible place that is open, dynamic, and always culturally relevant.’the new design features modular boxes stacked along the exterior for exhibitions and public engagementExpanding Public Engagement in seoulHeatherwick Studio’s vision for the Coex Convention Centre in Seoul extends beyond its visual transformation. The project reimagines the ground floor as a public space with diverse activities that encourage both visitors and residents to linger and explore. This new public realm will connect seamlessly with the adjacent park, providing the Gangnam community with an inviting space, even when no events are scheduled.At the upper levels, the redesigned Coex Convention Centre in Seoul will include new indoor and outdoor spaces, ensuring a balance between formal event functions and public accessibility. A sky garden and viewing deck will offer panoramic views of Seoul and the Han River, reinforcing the venue as a year-round attraction rather than a space limited to scheduled conventions.Heatherwick Studio has embedded sustainability into the Coex Convention Centre project in Seoul, ensuring that it not only meets but exceeds future environmental standards. The redesign prioritizes: Maximizing material reuse; enhancing energy efficiency; improving indoor and outdoor environmental comfort; and promoting overall well-being for visitors and occupants.the facade redesign maximizes material reuse and enhances accessibility and visual appealthe ground floor will be reimagined as a public space connecting with the adjacent park in Gangnamproject info:name: Coex Convention Centrearchitect: Heatherwick Studio | @officialheatherwickstudiolocation: Seoul, Koreacompletion: expected 2029visualizations: © Devisual | @devisualchina",
