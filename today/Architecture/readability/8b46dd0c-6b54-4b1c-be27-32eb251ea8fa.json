  "text": "anchor If there is a lesson to be taken from this year, it is that small evils lead to ever-bigger ones. The wrong behaviors and motivations get rewarded until the process capitalizes into a singular upending spectacle. That reality is just as resurgent in professional spheres and does appear likely to retain its dominance over other civic ones. Unethical practices, the influence (good or bad) of politics and public opinion, removal of history, and a culture of dishonesty coursed, as ever, through the domain of architecture in 2024. Inside its ranks, questions as to why the cycle itself is so prevalent continue to go unsettled. Here, instead, is an impartial breakdown of the year’s most controversial news headlines in architecture. What can be taken from it is a testimony to the ways moral disintegration is both reflected and can be defeated in our built environment. We’ll start with the biggest stories and slowly narrow into a spotlight on the global salients within more limited constraints. It may be out of context, but the sight of labor issues once again losing ground to economic immediacy in the face of fiscal instability seems subconsciously worth noting. From June: Saudi officials ordered lethal force to make room for NEOM, former security forces commander claimsFirst, in the Gulf region, where Saudi Arabia's NEOM plans had become a font for controversy even before Bloomberg’s unnamed source sprouted in an April report that later confirmed details concerning the planned 170-kilometer-long main structure's difficulty. The Line’s violations on the people and earth whose displacement it requires may be the reason for some dropping out of the project lest they be put in front of a growing chorus of skeptics calling its vision unattainable and exposing its allegedly dangerous labor practices. Also from June: AIA Board of Trustees issues statement in response to controversyThe drama unfolding at AIA National with leadership’s wintertime endeavors and other missteps being made into a screaming matter by late spring, resulted in an internal complaint by the end of summer and remained unresolved until the resignation of CEO/EVP Lakisha Ann Woods on December 10th. Elsewhere in D.C., the Architect of the Capitol’s abuse of office saga, some thought to be over, was extended into earlier this month with news of Chere Rexroat’s employment discrimination case went public along with her quizzical status as a defendant in another. From January: Plans for London’s Sphere are no more as developers abandon projectThe London Sphere is finally no more after a yearslong concerted effort by community members in East London to block the mammoth Populous project (whose Las Vegas cousin eclipsed $1 billion in revenue in the FY 2024). Meanwhile, Oklahoma was the place where, somewhat paradoxically, the debt-laden Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Price Tower suffered its owner’s forbidden furniture sale.  From March: LA City Council places Dodger Stadium Gondola project on hold pending further reviewsLocally, the projected $550 million LA Dodger Stadium gondola proposal appears to have stopped pending future reviews after multiple Angelenos’ legal challenges mindful of gentrification and carbon emissions were rejected. In New York’s Chinatown, work to demolish the neighborhood’s existing jail (aka The Tombs) terrified residents already living in fear and opposition to its future record-holding replacement. In the rest of Manhattan, the hot-button issue of a congestion pricing mandate also looks like it has faltered. From June: Moriyama Teshima Architects opposes 'shock' closure of Ontario Science Centre in new letterAbroad, a revisionistic German AfD party’s parliamentary push tried to declare the original Bauhaus to have led modernism in the wrong direction. In Canada, memorial designer Renée Daoust is suing the federal government over a rule-changing swap she says could create a \"very dangerous precedent\" for her country in terms of architectural competitions. There, other lawsuits failed to block Toronto’s contentious Ontario Place while preservationists there are still fighting the planned demolition of Raymond Moriyama's Ontario Science Centre—a surfeited reality that’s \"based on a faulty business case,\" according to the critic Elsa Lam. From July: UK gov't cancels long-controversial highway tunnel project near StonehengeFinally, back stateside, Chris Pratt’s imbecilic entry into architectural history and the politics of preservation proved less winsome than the trope his on-screen persona relies on after he and Katherine Schwarzenegger’s decision to raze a historic Craig Ellwood design for a modern farmhouse drew ire online and from the LA Conservancy. Their story highlights how the topic has grown in importance not just for American architects but for those in other countries. It also points out the destructive pettiness of personal ambition, greed, and poorly envisioned planning that can cloud sentiments about the profession. Through them, some will invariably lose favor. On the side, the same people are working to solve existential global problems and bring better design into the public consciousness.
