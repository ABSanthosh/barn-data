  "text": "tchoban foundation to exhibit the american architect’s archiveIn February 2025, the Tchoban Foundation in Berlin will open an exhibition titled Steven Holl — Drawing as Thought, showcasing the American architect’s extensive body of work. Steven Holl is known globally for his cultural and public buildings, which include museums, art centers, concert halls, libraries, and universities. He is equally recognized for his drawing practice. The exhibition will focus on his watercolors and large-scale black-and-white drawings, including those from the competition-winning design for the expansion of the Amerika-Gedenkbibliothek in Berlin in 1988. Steven Holl — Drawing as Thought will run from February 7th until May 4th, 2025.Chapel of St. Ignatius, Seattle University, Seattle, Washington, USA. Perspektivische Ansicht 1, bei Nacht. 1995, Aquarell und Bleistift auf Papier, 25,4 × 35,24 cm © Steven Hollinside ‘steven holl — drawing as thought’Berlin’s Tchoban Foundation will highlight architect Steven Holl’s architectural philosophy across its exhibition of drawings and watercolors. Central to this philosophy are three ‘principal missions’: the role of art in driving architecture, the necessity for ecological excellence, and the exploration of space, light, material, and detail as experimental phenomena. This museum will feature both realized and unrealized projects, offering visitors a deep look into his creative process and the role of drawing in his design thinking.Steven Holl — Drawing as Thought will include a range of Holl’s works, from unrealized designs for the Palazzo del Cinema in Venice (1990) and Porta Vittoria in Milan (1986), to iconic completed projects such as the Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki (1993–1998), the Chapel of St. Ignatius at Seattle University (1994–1997), Maggie’s Centre in London (2012–2017), and The REACH at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. (2012–2019). Holl’s drawings provide insights into his approach to architecture as an evolving, experimental practice.Museum für zeitgenössische Kunst Kiasma, Helsinki. Studie, Schnitt, 1993, Aquarell und Bleistift auf Papier, 40,32 × 56,52 cm © Steven Holla curated Glimpse into an Overwhelming Body of WorkThe exhibition concludes with sketches for Steven Holl’s Ex of In House (2016), a personal retreat in Rhinebeck, bringing a glimpse of Upstate New York to Berlin. This sculptural lakefront refuge, recognized by its dramatic spherical subtractions, is described as his ‘ideal place’ for drawing, highlighting the importance of environment and solitude in his creative process.While the show presents only a small selection of Holl’s immense collection of over 50,000 sketches, black-and-white drawings, and watercolors, each drawing stands on its own as a piece to be explored and studied individually. This is precisely what Steven Holl hopes for visitors to experience — a personal encounter with each piece of his work. The exhibition, curated by Kristin Feireiss, will also be accompanied by a catalog.To mark the opening of the exhibition, a discussion will take place on February 6th, 2025, at 5pm at the Aedes Metropolitan Laboratory. The event will feature a conversation between architect and researcher Diana Carta, Steven Holl, and Sergei Tchoban, offering further insight into Holl’s philosophy and work.Amerika-Gedenkbibliothek, Berlin.
