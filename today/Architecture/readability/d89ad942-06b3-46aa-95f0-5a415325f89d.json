  "text": "Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat can I use instead of a bathroom vanity?While major furniture retailers have plenty of ready-to-install vanity options, you can also get creative with bathroom vanity ideas by putting a spin on a vintage dresser or credenza. “These can be retrofitted to handle the storage you need and often have carved details and brass hardware not found on new vanities,” points out Verruto, the founder of Blythe Interiors.Liu even used a piece of wood to create a vanity with a vessel sink. If you do go the DIY route, keep in mind that transforming a piece of furniture into a vanity requires both plumbing and carpentry skills.What color bathroom vanity is timeless?When polling design experts on what a timeless bathroom vanity means to them, they all agreed that natural is the color of choice. This could mean something like walnut or oak cabinetry, though it can also stay neutral with navy, charcoal, and taupe, Hayward adds. White and off-white design ideas are also a popular choice and “suitable for any bathroom, regardless of the door style. “Their enduring appeal speaks for itself,” Saine continues.A bold vanity color can also make a statement, but know that popular colors tend to change rapidly and may not always endure, Fisher adds. When in doubt, stick to a white or wood bathroom vanity and bring in a bright design via paint color or coverings on the bathroom walls, which are easier to switch up.What are the most popular colors for bathroom vanities?According to 2024 US Houzz Bathroom Trends Study, “wood is the new white for vanities.” Gray and blue vanities tie for third place. “We are seeing a lot of darker greens, wood tones, and natural materials making a resurgence,” Hayward says. “Keeping the vanity style classic allows more freedom in color and materials.”With the rise of eclectic bathroom styles, bathroom vanity hues are also getting more whimsical. “I’d welcome the introduction of more vibrant colors such as pink, yellow, and orange,” Saine says.What does a modern vanity look like?Historically, a traditional vanity is typically a sink with legs and limited storage, so anything with storage is technically a modern vanity, Fisher explains. But design-wise, sleek, linear vanities that are cantilevered or appear to be floating are examples of a contemporary aesthetic, he adds.For Verruto, flat panel or skinny shaker doors, as well as clean lines and minimalistic detail is what a modern vanity is all about. Unexpected elements are what draws Saine to fresh design ideas: sleek slab doors, bold stone tops, and integrated sinks.",
