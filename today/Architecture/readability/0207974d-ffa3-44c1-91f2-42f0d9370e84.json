  "text": "At its heart, Architizer’s A+Product Awards celebrates products and materials that redefine the possibilities of design, technology and sustainability within architecture. For brands entering this season’s program, the ultimate goal is to follow in the footsteps of last season’s celebrated winners and have their work recognized by some of the most influential voices in the industry. Enter the A+Product Awards Currently open for entries, the 2025 A+Product Awards places innovative work in front of a jury of top architects and designers who are shaping the future of the built environment. Many of these thought leaders recently shared their thoughts on last year’s pioneering products as a precursor to this year’s celebration and reflected on the power of this unique industry program to champion good design. CUPACLAD by Cupa Pizarras, A+Product Awards Popular Choice Winner in the Building Envelopes, Cladding \u0026 Roofing category. Reflecting on the program’s mission, Mecanoo Founding Partner and A+Product Awards Juror Francine Houben described the judging experience as “an inspiring exploration of innovation and excellence in design, enriching our built environment.” With Mecanoo winning this year’s Firm of the Year Award, Houben’s perspective carries great weight, underscoring how the A+Product Awards contributes to a larger goal: celebrating products that match up to the exacting demands of the world’s best architecture firms. Among the defining themes in last season’s winning entries was sustainability. As Stantec‘s Hamidreza Khademi noted, “The finalists and winners embody sophisticated design, blending ingenuity, aesthetic appeal, and tangible impact. Notably, sustainability is a prevalent theme, with many products incorporating recycled materials and strategies to reduce environmental impact.” Last season’s jurors were frequently impressed with how sustainable practices were rigorously integrated into high-performance, visually compelling products — a vision that 2025 entrants can aspire to emulate. DEKTON Pietra Kode by Cosentino Group, A+Product Awards Jury Winner in the Hard Surfacing, Tiles \u0026 Stone category. The craftsmanship and materiality of last year’s winning products also left a lasting impression on the jurors. As Architectural Engineering Consultants‘ Alessandro Mangano shared, “I was impressed with the quality of craftsmanship, the use of color and composition displayed. The use of texture in many products was beautifully done.” Mangano’s remarks underscore the commitment to quality and artistry that distinguished these entries, creating a standard for future entries to meet. Enter a Product In a rapidly changing design landscape, flexibility and adaptability were also key strengths recognized in last year’s winners. Juror Grace Eun, Senior Designer at Studio O+A, praised the trend toward “solutions with flexibility and adaptability,” while Gary A. Li, Principal at Kostow Greenwood Architects, highlighted the “technological advances within various industries and sectors — from the integration of multifunctional fixtures, accessories, products to the ability to meet many technical and sustainable goals with new materials.” Entrants in the 2025 A+Product Awards will have the chance to showcase their own versatile, resilient designs in front of a jury eager to champion innovation once again. Obi by Expormim, A+Product Awards Jury Winner in the Outdoor Furniture category. Juror Louise Braverman, Founding Principal of Louise Braverman Architect, celebrated the impact of the multi-faceted qualities of the winning products, noting: “Many of these products aesthetically amplify and simultaneously de-carbonize our physical world. This is good news!” Her reflections capture how winning entries can go beyond functional success to make a profound impact on our world — a goal that jurors will hope is carried forward in this year’s program. Whether exploring new sustainable materials or modular systems that enhance functionality, the A+Product Awards honor work that enriches both people and planet. As juror Gavin Leung, Founder and Chief Designer at Bagua+Bhava, summarized: “The quality of work showcased this year was exceptionally high. Each product demonstrated meticulous attention to detail, innovative design, and a commitment to excellence.” For 2025 entrants, this is an inspiring standard to meet, demonstrating that thoughtful design and innovation can make a lasting difference. Tantimber Thermowood by Tantimber, A+Product Awards Finalist in the Sustainable Design category. With the 2025 A+Product Awards currently accepting entries, brands worldwide are invited to join this legacy of impactful design and innovation. This is your chance to showcase work that could become the next benchmark for excellence, inspiring jurors and architects alike as they continue to shape the future of architecture.
