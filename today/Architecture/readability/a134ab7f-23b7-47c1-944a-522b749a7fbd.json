  "text": "studio gang reveals their first completed project in franceStudio Gang, led by the American architect Jeanne Gang, completes their first project in France, the University of Chicago’s John W. Boyer Center in Paris. A brise-soleil facade of approximately 900 cylindrical stone batons filters light and responds to the program inside. The layout is organized around a transparent, multistory atrium—the Vertical Campus—that connects all major spaces and fills the interior with natural light. This central hub arranges learning, working, and social spaces to promote interaction among academic departments, students, and visitors.Outdoor green areas, including a biodiverse rooftop garden, offer access to nature and fresh air. At the same time, programs are strategically positioned around the atrium for easy movement between study and social spaces.‘The Center in Paris is designed as a vertical campus. Its multilevel atrium provides all the spaces with light and offers visual connections across programs,’ shares Jeanne Gang.‘We wanted the building to amplify social interactions, scholarly collaborations, and cultural exchange between the University and the City of Paris.’images © Fabrice Fouillet, courtesy of Studio Ganglimestone facade links the center with the urban contextThis Paris Center expands on Studio Gang’s ongoing work with the University of Chicago, following their completion of a 400,000-square-foot residential building on the Chicago campus in 2016. Located in Paris’s 13th arrondissement, a key area for research and higher education, on the Rive Gauce neighborhood, the Center is part of a broader development. The cylindrical stone baton facade of the building, crafted from locally sourced Lutetian limestone, brings a sense of lightness to the structure while connecting it the architectural heritage of the city. These stone batons, quarried just 40 kilometers from the site, create a variable texture by densifying around private study areas and opening up to reveal activity in public spaces. The use of limestone references the Chicago campus of the Univiersity and unites the building visually with PARC Architectes’ adjacent residential buildings.On the top floor, a double-height event space with a biodiverse rooftop garden, the Great Room, enhances the role of the Center as a forum for intellectual exchange and offers views of Paris. This flexible event space together with an adjacent amphitheater accommodate conferences, lectures, and social gatherings, supporting the mission of the establishment.a signature element of the Center is its brise-soleil facade of approximately 900 cylindrical stone batonsintegrating sustainable materials and energy efficient systemsThe design of the Center aligns with the environmental goals of its French city, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient systems. Its hybrid mass timber structure and masonry facade contribute to a reduced carbon footprint, while outdoor terraces and a central courtyard encourage natural ventilation and support biodiversity through native plantings.Photovoltaic panels on the roof generate clean, on-site energy, and the building is connected to the district’s heating and cooling network to maximize efficiency. The massing of the structure is carefully shaped to capture optimal daylight and enhance air circulation. Situated directly above a regional train station, the Center provides convenient access for university students, faculty, and Parisians alike, while animating the streetscape with a commissioned artwork by artist Tony Lewis.the limestone batons were quarried just 40 kilometers from the sitethe Center is organized around a transparent, multistory atriumprograms are strategically positioned around the atrium for easy movement between study and social spacesa double-height event space enhances the role of the Center as a forum for intellectual exchange",
