  "text": "Erwan Bouroullec and LVArchitectes complete farm RenovationDesigner Erwan Bouroullec collaborated with LVArchitectes, led by Guillaume Le Dévéhat and Charlotte Vuarnesson, to transform an old farm in Burgundy, France, into a versatile, enduring space. The project embraced a meticulous and thoughtful approach, emphasizing respect for the site’s history, collective intelligence, and integration with its natural surroundings. The result is a ‘landscape house’ gently nestled on a slope, offering nearly 360-degree views of the surrounding valleys and forests. This reimagining of rural architecture exudes a simple, radical beauty while demonstrating efficient environmental design. Former barns and stables now serve as resilient, multi-functional spaces, housing living quarters, workshops, and other diverse uses.The design process was guided by a profound understanding of the building’s layers and history, ensuring its transformation respected the past without erasing it. The architects worked with the existing structure, magnifying its raw beauty by revealing its materials and preserving its authenticity. The natural slope of the land was maintained, with the buildings following its contours to blend harmoniously with the environment. Pathways were gently shaped, creating balanced areas for flora and fauna to thrive. Openings were strategically positioned to facilitate natural ventilation and air circulation, while seasonal changes in light and landscape were observed to enhance the spatial experience. The architecture not only integrated with the landscape but also invited nature into the home, with vegetation woven into the facades.the project by Erwan Bouroullec and LVA Architects reimagines rural architecture | image by ©Charles PetillonLa Grange rehabilitation project reuses barn’s original materialsThe rehabilitation by studio LVArchitectes and designer Erwan Bouroullec preserved the overall organization of buildings around the courtyard while opening views to the south by removing a collapsing section. Part of the old stable’s asbestos roof was replaced to create a spacious, multi-purpose area. The former silage pit was transformed into a natural swimming pool, while new frameworks of Douglas fir were paired with aged stone, achieving both structural continuity and warmth. Polycarbonate panels in the workshop areas now filter natural light, creating comfortable intermediate spaces that remain cool in summer and shield from winter winds. Rainwater is collected and stored in an underground tank, and reused for garden irrigation and to supply the naturally filtered swimming pool. A rainwater basin made from a galvanized steel trough, featuring vegetation and fish, punctuated the facade as a thoughtful and aesthetic detail.Sustainability was a core consideration, with the roof insulated using wood fiber, windows fitted with double glazing, and underfloor heating supplemented by wood-burning stoves. Existing stone walls were retained, with lightweight wood-frame partitions added where needed. Materials were reused wherever possible, with oak from removed trusses repurposed for new lintels, local quarry gravel used for site work, and terracotta tiles salvaged for window sills. Stones found on-site were even crafted into stair treads, exemplifying the project’s resourceful approach. The design anticipates future renovations, including the conversion of a charming dovecote with its lauze-edged roof and simple volume, ensuring the site continues to evolve while maintaining its connection to the past.‘landscape house’ nestled on a gentle slope offers views of Burgundy’s valleys | image by ©Charles Petillonbuildings follow the land’s natural slope, standing in harmony with the environment | image by ©Philippe Thibaultthe design respects the farm’s history, preserving authenticity with a fresh vision | image by ©Philippe Thibaultsliding glass panels and strategic openings ensure natural ventilation and light | image by ©Philippe ThibaultDouglas fir frameworks and stone ensure warmth, continuity, and structural beauty | image by ©Philippe Thibaultlarge glazed openings bring the beauty of the landscape into the living spaces | image by ©Philippe Thibaultthe architecture invites nature into the home, with vegetation woven into the facades | image by ©Philippe Thibault",
