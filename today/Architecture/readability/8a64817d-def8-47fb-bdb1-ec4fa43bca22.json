  "text": "Archiro VietNam Blends Japanese Myth and Modern DesignIn Can Tho, Vietnam, architecture firm Archiro VietNam has designed Trăng Non, a residence that draws on the myth of Kaguya Hime, the Moon Princess, blending traditional Japanese influences with modern architectural elements. The house reflects the emotional depth of the tale, in which the moon rises over Mount Fuji, symbolizing eternal love and longing. The facade evokes a moonlit night, using bold geometric forms balanced by refined, softer elements to create a harmonious fusion of modernity and romantic charm. The interior continues this narrative with flowing lines and carefully curated lighting, reminiscent of moonlight rising over the mountain. Every detail serves to evoke the image of the moon slowly rising, with fluid spaces that reflect tranquility and connection. all images courtesy of Archiro VietNamTrăng Non serves as a spiritual sanctuary, a space for reflectionA notable design feature is the floating staircase and the bridge connecting the mezzanine level to the rest of the spaces, symbolizing a path between the earth and the moon—a reference to the longing of Kaguya Hime’s lover as he ascended Mount Fuji to reunite with the princess.
