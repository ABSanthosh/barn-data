  "text": "populus hotel opens with nature-inspired architectureThe newly completed Populus Tower, designed by architecture practice Studio Gang, has officially opened its doors in downtown Denver, Colorado. With its eco-conscious architecture and nature-inspired facade, Populus is a landmark project that integrates architectural innovation with biophilic design principles. The 265-room hotel, developed by Urban Villages and managed by Aparium Hotel Group, aims to reconnect guests with nature in the heart of the city. See designboom’s previous coverage here!‘The opening of Populus marks an incredibly significant milestone and represents a new model of environmentally conscious hospitality that will forever change the guest experience for mindful travelers, while adding vibrancy to the city of Denver,’ said Jon Buerge, President of Urban Villages. ‘We are excited to watch Populus come to life as the center of a thriving community, becoming everything from the new neighborhood hotspot to a must visit hotel destination, all while inspiring the industry to rethink how hotels can prioritize the health of the planet in a positive, engaging, and meaningful way.’Populus is a newly completed hotel in downtown Denver designed by Studio Gang | image © Jason O’Rearstudio gang draws from colorado aspen treesStudio Gang’s design for Populus takes direct inspiration from Colorado’s beloved aspen trees, known scientifically as Populus Tremuloides, which serve as a recurring symbol of the state’s natural beauty. The hotel’s most defining architectural feature is an array of eye-shaped windows, which the architects shape to reference the dark markings found on the bark of aspen trees. Each window varies in size and function, offering expansive views of Denver’s skyline at the building’s base and more intimate, private settings for the hotel rooms above.The windows also play a functional role. They are designed to optimize energy efficiency by reducing solar gain through outwardly extending ‘lids’ that shade the interior. The thoughtful use of materials and form contributes to Populus’ ability to perform well in Denver’s varying climate conditions, marking Studio Gang’s first project in Colorado as both a visual and environmental success.the architecture is inspired by the natural ecology of Colorado, especially its aspen trees | image © Jason O’Rearinside the new hotelInside the Studio Gang’s Populus hotel, studio Wildman Chalmers Design and studio FOWLER Architecture and Design have created an interior environment that complements the nature-focused theme. The hotel’s interiors incorporate natural materials, such as reclaimed wood and sustainable textiles, to evoke the feeling of moving through a forest. The lobby is characterized by warm tones and wood accents, reminiscent of a forest floor, while the hotel’s guest rooms and upper levels aim to represent the trunk and canopy of an aspen grove.This theme is further enhanced by the use of environmentally responsible materials. Reclaimed wood from Wyoming, biodegradable carpeting, and beetle-kill pine headboards are just a few examples of the sustainable choices made throughout the building. The hotel’s focus on biophilic design and sustainability is evident in every detail, from the natural light flooding the rooms to the earthy textures and finishes.windows evoke the eye shaped marks of aspen tree bark and vary in size | image © Jason O’RearPopulus seeks to shape and contribute to the evolving landscape of Denver. By incorporating biophilic design principles and landscaping by locally-based studio Superbloom, Studio Gang has redefined what an urban tower can achieve. The hotel’s design is a reflection of Denver’s unique balance between city life and closeness to nature.‘Denver strikes a unique balance between being a vibrant city and a gateway to some of the country’s most awe-inspiring natural landscapes,’ says Jeanne Gang, Founding Partner of Studio Gang. ‘Our goal was to draw from this distinct urban character and rich ecology to create a building that would help define the skyline of this thriving city.’What’s more, the project actively supporting environmental stewardship. For every night spent at the hotel, a tree is planted, creating a direct impact on the environment. This initiative aligns with the ethos of Urban Villages, the project’s developer, which is known for its commitment to sustainability.eco conscious features include shading elements and energy efficient materials | image © Jason O’RearPopulus plants a tree for every night a guest stays | image © Jason O’Rear",
