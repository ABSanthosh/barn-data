The Breaking Bad house—the real-life Albuquerque residence that served as Walter White’s home in the AMC drama, and where flocks of fans have pilgrimaged over the years to take photos and recreate an iconic scene in which the crystal-meth-selling antihero angrily tossed a pepperoni pie on the roof—has landed on the market. Such hallowed ground will cost you, though. Zillow estimates the New Mexico home’s value on par with the surrounding properties at around $340,000, but according to TMZ, the asking price for this 1,900-square-foot abode is a whopping $4 million.Unsurprisingly, the house’s fame is heavily featured in marketing materials. “Step behind the camera and experience this home like never before,” reads the listing website. “Featuring instantly recognizable architecture and timeless charm, this property is more than just a home—it’s a symbol of cinematic storytelling.”The four-bedroom, one-bathroom dwelling was built in 1972 and then scooped up by Fran and Louis Padilla the following year. 52 years later, the couple’s children, who grew up in the home, are its owners. The Breaking Bad producers came a-knocking in 2006. Two weeks later, filming for the series, which starred Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, officially began. One of the Padilla children, Joanne Quintana, told local news outlet KOB that the family was present throughout the show’s production; Fran even provided cookies for the cast and crew. Though the dwelling’s exterior and backyard swimming pool featured prominently in the series, the interior was only used to house gear and prep areas.Join NowNew Year's Sale: Become an AD PRO member for only $20 $12 per monthArrowWhen the show blew up, fans were quick to find the abode. In 2015, it got so bad that showrunner Vince Gilligan had to make a plea for fans to stop showing up with pizzas to throw on the roof. Since then, the Padillas have installed gates, cameras, and numerous private property signs. One reads, “Take your pictures from across the street! DO NOT DISTURB US.” 12 years after the series finale aired, an average of 300 cars still visit the home every day, Quintana told KOB. “I hope they make it what the fans want,” she said. “They want a B\u0026B, they want a museum, they want access to it. Go for it.”",
