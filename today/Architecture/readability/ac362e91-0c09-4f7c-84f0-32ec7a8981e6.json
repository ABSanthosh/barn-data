  "text": "anchor The National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) has announced a consensus opinion regarding the regulation of artificial intelligence technology and its future impact on the architectural profession. This announcement emerged from NCARB's 2024 Annual Business Meeting in June, where 150 licensing board members convened. The meeting built on earlier discussions held during the March 2024 Regional Summit and the inaugural Futures Symposium in December 2023, which explored AI's impact on the profession. NCARB stated, \"Going forward, NCARB will continue to monitor the expanding use of AI across practice and its potential interface with the regulatory mission of NCARB and its members. NCARB remains committed to collaborating with its licensing board members to ensure the best interests of the public are served through the effective and reasonable regulation of architectural practice.\" NCARB emphasized that while advancements in AI and computational design are providing architects with new labor-saving tools, it is essential that architects maintain responsibility and accountability. They noted that AI is a tool, not a replacement for professional judgment, and that regardless of the AI tools used, it remains the architect's duty to conform to the standard of care and remain in responsible control of all technical submissions under their seal. The organization also highlighted key points of consensus from their regulatory community: Regulators should not limit the use of technological advances that support the profession’s ability to improve the health, safety, and welfare of the public.It falls outside of NCARB's mission and expertise to evaluate or provide opinions on specific AI tools and their application, nor is there precedence for enforcing limitations on a tool's use.Any proposed regulation must ensure that the licensed practitioner remains responsible and accountable for all work produced, regardless of AI involvement.In addition, NCARB plans to explore guidance and best practices for architects using AI, including reassessment of responsible control parameters and identification of best practices for ethical AI usage.
