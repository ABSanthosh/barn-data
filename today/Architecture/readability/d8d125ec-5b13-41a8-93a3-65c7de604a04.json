  "text": "Below, Laura Gwyn and Jason F. McLennan of the global design firm Perkins\u0026Will write about the recent hurricanes affecting the South and how the architecture and planning communities can prepare for our new normal.Well before Hurricane Helene, the allure of living on or near the water has drawn hundreds of thousands of people to coastal and river towns in Florida, Georgia, Texas, and the Carolinas. For decades, scientists have sounded alarms about the dangerous impact of human-induced climate change. Sadly, these warnings have gone unheeded, leading to unspeakable loss and damage as seen in the last week in cities throughout the South. Florida, which is receiving a one-two punch from both hurricanes Helene and Milton, has just incured unthinkable damage.A van flows in floodwaters near the Biltmore Village in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Asheville, North Carolina.

Our North Carolina studio is heartbroken over the flooding at the New Belgium Brewery in Asheville, which we designed and was completed in 2016.The New Belgium Brewery in Asheville before Hurricane Helene devastated the area. Photo: Mark HerbothWhile sustainability was a driver for the construction of the brewery, and the site elevation was raised to mitigate a 100-year flood (which helped the damage), it could not prevent total flooding from such a catastrophic and powerful event as we saw at the end of September, and into early October.High in the mountains, Asheville residents thought they would be spared from climate impacts. But Hurricane Helene brought the town not a 200-year flood, but a 1,200-year flood. The already saturated ground could not withstand the torrential rain, effectively turning the mountains into a series of funnels that drove more water into the swollen French Broad and Swanannoa rivers. The flood washed out roads and bridges, destroyed whole neighborhoods like the famous Asheville River Arts District, and made towns like Chimney Rock, North Carolina, unrecognizable.Chimney Rock before the hurricane.

And we know this won’t be the last storm. In fact, we expect that this is a new normal in a world that is getting warmer with more frequent and more devastating hurricanes and environmental events.Designed by Perkins\u0026Will, the Henrico County Public Schools Living Building for the Center for Environmental Studies and Sustainability in Virginia will be the world’s first ‘living’ environmental center for public schools when it's estimated to be completed at the end of 2026. Photo: Courtesy of Perkins\u0026WillThis new normal requires a different approach to how we design our buildings, plan our cities and towns, and create and use energy. After Hurricane Maria—which, in 2017, devastated the northeastern Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico—Perkins\u0026Will worked with various entities to develop ResilientSEE, a resilient planning framework that can be applied to neighborhoods, districts, cities, and countries in need. ResilientSEE offered a multi-lens approach that considered social, economic, and environmental vulnerabilities and helped communities in Puerto Rico to recover in sustainable ways. The same holistic approach could be used to help communities throughout the South in 2024 and beyond.How should we think differently about building in light of climate change?1. Change how we designWe need to craft buildings and infrastructure that is greener, healthier, and more resilient. And we must think carefully about where we build, especially in relation to water. We should embrace the design principles laid out by the International Living Futures Institute’s Living Building Challenge that are creating the greenest buildings in the world, because they run solely on renewable energy and are vastly better for the environment as well as for people’s health and well-being. They are more resilient buildings—with their own power and water supplies and ability to stay comfortable even when systems fail. A current Perkins\u0026Will project in Henrico County, Virginia, is being designed for a 500-year flood plain and will feature onsite wastewater treatment, water harvesting, and energy generation.2. Rethink energyWe need to eliminate our dependency on fossil fuels and accelerate efforts to decarbonize in order to reduce and eliminate greenhouse gas emissions so that we don’t make what is today a dire situation even worse.3. Depoliticize climate changeAs we are seeing with these most recent storms, climate change is a matter of life and death and economic security for our communities. It should never become a political issue. We need to bring everyone who has a stake in our communities—residents, architects, builders, planners, scientists, policy makers, and politicians—together to chart a new path forward, irregardless of political party affiliation.For now, however, we want to surround our cherished and battered Appalachian region with help to address immediate needs as well as later support on rebuilding in ways that safeguard both the physical and social infrastructure in these communities. It is also important to remember we cannot bury our heads in the sand and, in a month’s time, forget about these recent hurricanes. The human and financial costs of ever worsening climate events are too high. There are solutions, but they will require that we have the will and grit to embrace new approaches to ensure a healthy future for all of us. Our lives, quite literally, depend on it.Donate to the victims of Hurricane Helene.Laura Gwyn is principal and managing director of Perkins\u0026Will’s North Carolina Studio.Jason F.
