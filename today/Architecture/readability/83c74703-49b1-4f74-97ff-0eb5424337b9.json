  "text": "In the heart of the Copenhagen Harbour, a two-story modern houseboat now floats serenely between the opera house and the revitalized Paper Island. This architectural feat belongs to Danish designer and craftsman Søren Hvalsøe Garde, founder of the esteemed design company Garde Hvalsøe. Merging innovative living with timeless craftsmanship, the 1,507-square-foot home represents a personal and professional milestone for Garde, who spent nearly two years perfecting the project. The journey began when Garde was inspired by his son’s move to a floating community in Refshaleøen, known for its eco-conscious design and affordable student housing fashioned from shipping containers. That experience sparked a deeper curiosity in the potential of water-based living. Garde, a lifelong maker and designer, saw an opportunity to construct something that fused his love for functional beauty with his fascination for alternative living spaces. Finding the perfect spot proved to be the most elusive part of the plan. With the city’s harbor space in high demand, it took months of persistence before Garde secured an ideal location with scenic views and architectural prestige. From there, the vision took shape in collaboration with architect Anders Halsteen, resulting in a houseboat that blurs the line between residence and design object. Built in Poland and floated to its permanent site in Copenhagen, the structure features expansive glass walls that invite the harbor in, while carefully placed terraces offer outdoor sanctuaries above the waterline. The exterior is sheathed in dark wood cladding reminiscent of Garde Hvalsøe’s signature wardrobes, ensuring both privacy and harmony with the urban landscape. Inside, the space is a showcase of bespoke details and high-end materials. The kitchen, a focal point for Garde and his wife Rita, features handcrafted Garde Hvalsøe cabinetry, a dramatic stone countertop, and open displays of culinary tools that speak to the couple’s passion for cooking. Vintage furniture by Bruno Mathsson and Hans Wegner anchor the dining area in Scandinavian heritage, while contemporary lighting and minimalist design add a refined edge. “I love the process of creating something new, and by building from scratch, you get everything exactly as you want,” says Søren, who took the same approach to this project as he does his cabinetry company. Materials throughout the houseboat reflect both luxury and longevity. From brass bathroom fixtures that will develop a natural patina over time to fine oak flooring by Dinesen and concrete surfaces, the palette is restrained but richly tactile. Even the shower, tiled in soft neutral tones, exudes a quiet elegance. Despite downsizing from a larger home, the couple prioritized shared spaces over private rooms. The layout maximizes openness and flow, with communal areas taking center stage. A sheltered deck garden, perfect for summer dinners, completes the setting – a space designed for living slowly and savoring the water views. A highlight feature is the custom-designed wine cellar, lined in oak and temperature-controlled via a system that draws on the surrounding seawater. This blend of form and function exemplifies the meticulous planning behind every detail of the home. Reflecting on the arrival of his floating home, Garde recalls the emotional weight of seeing it towed into place on a calm summer evening. Since then, life on the water has offered a renewed sense of serenity. The gentle motion of the home and the ever-changing light over the harbor have become part of daily life – an embodiment of Garde’s belief that thoughtful design can elevate the everyday.
