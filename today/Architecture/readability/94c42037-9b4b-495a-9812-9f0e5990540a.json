  "text": "“It was an enchanted geodome,” says longtime Pacific Palisades resident Tamara Rawitt, of the area she called home. “It was enchanted.” Rawitt, an Emmy winner and cocreator and producer of In Living Color, lost her home in the catastrophic fire that devastated around 75% of the Pacific Palisades. “Everyone knew how lucky we were to be there,” she says.  “We knew we were a Fabergé egg, and you want to get up close because it’s so precious-looking and so special and fragile, as was proven.”The Pacific Palisades, a sun-kissed enclave of around 23,000 artists, cinematographers, actors, and lawyers, nestled between Malibu and Santa Monica and the Pacific Ocean, is now a burned-out shell. Thousands of people have lost homes and businesses, including celebrities like Anthony Hopkins, Mel Gibson, Eugene Levy, Billy Crystal, Cary Elwes, Melissa Rivers, Lakers coach JJ Redick, Jeff Bridges, Paris Hilton, and Adam Brody and Leighton Meester.Cultural and architectural wonders have been lost as well. A postwar haven for architects, structures destroyed include a home by modernist master Richard Neutra, the brutalist Robert Bridges’ house that once towered over Sunset Blvd., and modernist Ray Kappe’s iconic Keeler House.A home burns during the fires in Pacific Palisades in early January 2025.

Silent stars paraded on massive outdoor sets, including sprawling Wild West sets, a Japanese village, and a Swiss village, cooled by the temperate breezes of the Pacific Ocean.The Pacific Palisades proper was founded in 1922 by Methodist reverend Charles H. Scott, who established a religious community there. Nearby, beloved comedian and environmentalist Will Rogers’ ranch encompassed 359 acres in the Santa Monica Mountains, in what is now Will Rogers State Historic Park. The park was severely damaged in the fire, and Rogers’ iconic ranch house was destroyed, leaving preservationists to wonder what’s next.A commercial building in Pacific Palisades was destroyed in LA's most destructive fire.

It’s a huge, huge loss,” Fine says.During the 1930s, the Palisades was also a haven for intellectual refugees from Europe, including novelist Thomas Mann (whose famous home was saved), Austrian writer Vicki Baum, and the authors Marta and Lion Feuchtwanger whose home Villa Aurora became a salon and is now a center for artists.In the postwar era, the Pacific Palisades became the perfect bucolic testing ground for Case Study architects like Rodney Walker,  Richard Neutra, and Charles Eames. Cliff May, who is known as the Father of the California Ranch House, also worked frequently in the area. As the community grew, it became known as the perfect place to raise children, an upscale Mayberry filled with natural wonders and a feeling of safety.“I’ve never experienced the kind of cohesive community feel that you got in the Palisades,” says native Bruce Wallin, a journalist whose home was destroyed in the fire. “You could walk to the schools, to the park, to the village, to the ice cream store, to everything, the movie theater back then. There were kids everywhere. You’d walk out your door and you’d find someone to play with.”An aerial view of the bucolic setting that made up the Pacific Palisades before the devastating fires this month.

It’s still like that. It’s a small town in the middle of one of the biggest cities in the US.”Even as prices in the Palisades have risen, this sense of familiarity and kindness remained.  “I love doing open houses in the Palisades,” says realtor Juliette Hohnen of Douglas Elliman. “People are so polite. It’s always sunny there. They’re just nice, normal people…. They’re not on three acres of land. They’re on small lots. And they value community.”Now, that community is shattered. “Your entire town has been obliterated off the face of the earth,” Wallin says. “It’s a trauma that’s just going to last for these kids for a long, long time. And, honestly, I’m mostly worried about older people, like my mom’s generation, and then the kids. They’re not as equipped to deal with a trauma like this.”And there are fears that it will never be the same again. “I’m feeling waves of numbness, waves of grief, and the reality that I might never see any of my neighbors again because everyone fled,” Rawitt says.Although they are now spread across the city, many from the Palisades are determined to reclaim the community spirit that resides not in buildings and infrastructure, but in their personal ties. “We lost every single possession we have, but we’ll rebuild,” Wallin says. “We’ll figure it out.”",
