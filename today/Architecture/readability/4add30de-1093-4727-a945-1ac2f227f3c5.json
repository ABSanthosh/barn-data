  "text": "“There are good people. There are bad people. There are Krefeld people.” The framed quote can be spotted in the impressive hallway of Verena Holthaus’s Munich apartment. If you aren’t familiar with German geography, Krefeld is a town in North Rhine-Westphalia where the creative consultant and entrepreneur hails from, though she has now lived in Munich’s lively Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt neighborhood for around nine years.Among Munich residents, Holthaus is known for her company Salon c/o, located not far from the city’s famous Englischer Garten. Salon c/o creates contemporary table settings though in her store at Werneckstrasse 5 (and online) she sells and rents table objects from a wide variety of eras. She also regularly hosts events with Munich creatives gathered around her exquisite tables, which then appear in many Instagram feeds. Holthaus invited AD Germany to sit down at one of her tables for this interview. The aroma of tea brewing filled the air as we sat under a red and white striped canopy above the table we’re seated at, while the gentle winter sun created an enchanting play of light on the silver and glassware. It’s an ideal atmosphere to discuss her apartment, Salon c/o, and young artists.Verena Holthaus next to the sculpture Formation of Universal Consciousness by Gregory Borlein, 2022. The hat on the wall is by Maryam Keyhani. Holthaus placed various objects atop the Biedermeier chest of drawers, including a ceramic box by André von Martens, the Mist vase by Tamer Nakisci for Nude, and the room fragrance by Peace in the Wild. A home in only black and white? Not at all! Verena Holthaus’s apartment is full of color. The Ettore Memphis armchair from Studio Greca matches the painted ceiling perfectly. Vintage wall lights (Vistosi), silver and porcelain objects (Salon c/o). AD: Verena, you dedicate yourself to tableware at Salon c/o, run a store, and organize various events. Today we are sitting at this artfully laid table. Could you please explain your concept in more detail?Verena Holthaus: It’s not easy for me to put it in one sentence. In the end, for me it is about a contemporary interpretation of the culture of gathering around a table. It’s about creating a place in Munich—or anywhere, for that matter—where people can come together, be inspired, and perhaps leave with new ideas. I achieve this through the following three pillars: concept, community, and conversation. I have both the store, which serves as a physical location where I sell and lend objects, and then there are my events with a focus on art and culture, which I also create for clients. There are also series of events such as the Gabelfrühstück [or second breakfast, a traditional meal in Bavaria between breakfast and lunch], which are designed to bring people together and inspire them. It’s very important to me that it’s not just about superficial objects, but also about the stories behind them. I always try to pick up on the history of the things I use in my settings: What period or style is a particular object? Where does the design come from? What was the inspiration? It’s about revisiting these beautiful old things in a modern context. Many of my objects have histories while they are also items that you want to continue to use.The image on the right is by Robert Jan Poorter, 2021. How did you end up with this unique career?I studied fashion and design management in Düsseldorf and actually always wanted to work in fashion. Even as a child, I was often sketching. My father was a photographer who did a lot of fashion work and he would sometimes take me to shoots. I actually had a clear path in mind and worked for stylist Karin van Noort when I was in school. She still influences my work today and taught me how to work with objects. After university, a job with fashion label Marc O’Polo took me to Bavaria, first to Rosenheim and then to Munich. But I always wanted to start my own business, so I decided to get an MBA in Innovation and Business at the Technical University of Munich. At the same time, I started my own business. Then, thanks to a friend, I moved into consulting—that was something completely different.It is indeed. What did you work on as a consultant?In the finance IT and fintech sectors. I’ve always liked to delve into new topics. I also try to bring people together to talk to each other and solve problems. And then at some point Salon c/o was added to the mix, and my consulting activities gave me the financial means to build up something on the side.Into the ring: An artfully laid table in the dining room. Tableware is Holthaus’s passion. The kitchen was Holthaus’s first painting project and she saturated the space in a deep forest green. The chairs and table here are from a flea market; the lamp is also vintage. Old brass tank shells now serve as vases. Kitchen: IKEA. Photo: Werner HolthausHolthaus’s favorite painting hangs on the wall: Fleck (Stain) by Andrej Maxim Auch. The chest of drawers from IKEA is decorated with a lamp by Sigmar Willnauer and a candelabra by Josef Frank for Svenskt Tenn from the 1920s, chair by Wassily Kadinsky. So how exactly did you come up with the idea of focusing on the culture of the table?The desire to bring people together came with my time in Munich. I used to celebrate New Year’s Eve with a group of friends here in my apartment. But as the parties got larger, we would always run out of dishes. At some point, my mother said: “We have so many dishes. Why don’t you just take some of ours?” That’s how it started and I took my experience and everything I learned with Karin von Noort and applied it to table settings. We celebrated New Year’s Eve after New Year’s Eve and I was always in charge of the table settings. At some point I started doing it for weddings too. And then I thought to myself, I have to do something more with this now. At some point it occurred to me that Munich was missing a space that brings people together, inspires them, and points them towards new ideas. So I started writing the first business plan in 2021 and then I opened the first space in Neuhausen in 2022. In the meantime, however, I’ve moved to a new location in Schwabing, not far from the Englischer Garten.What does tableware mean to you personally?From top to bottom: Fork and spoons by Nella Beljan; knife rest by Christofle (Salon c/o); mixed vintage cutlery. With Salon c/o, I have found something that brings people together. I don’t have any siblings, I was alone a lot with my parents. I think I would have liked to have experienced people gathered around a table more often. Somehow it always gives me a feeling of conviviality, that you’re not alone and that you can give something back to people. For me, a table always exudes a certain calm while at the same time it offers so many possibilities. At events, I always take a moment to step back and observe everyone sitting around the table, laughing, smiling, and immersed in conversation—there’s something very special about that for me.How exactly do you select the objects for your settings and your store?That’s a good question. Trusting my instincts plays a big role. My parents have always surrounded themselves with beautiful things. Not necessarily expensive objects, but beautiful ones and I think I’ve absorbed that over the years. The eye always has to linger on an object and trigger a reaction in me. I always look for a certain a-ha feeling.Oil painting by Andrej Maxim Auch, 2022. Silver, porcelain, and ceramic objects (Salon c/o). Hand-painted flower plates (Steffi Bauer), Tamegroute bowls (Nora Khereddine). On the metal shelving unit, a bowl from Raawii, a vase from Villeroy \u0026 Boch, and a glass jar from Lobmeyr. Where do you find these special items?Most of them come from flea and antique markets. I could go searching every week. I usually go with a friend who is just as passionate about these objects as I am. It’s nice because then we also look for items for each other. I also find objects in classified ads and at online auctions. I also pick up lots of finds when I’m traveling, for example in France, Belgium, or Italy.The Salon c/o space looks very clean and brutalist, very different from your apartment.That also reflects part of me. There are always two hearts beating in my chest. On the one hand, there’s the business side; I could spend days buried in spreadsheets and working on strategies, but I can also spend hours in museums or exploring flea markets. This duality runs through many areas of my life, including in my apartment and my workspace.Let’s talk about your apartment, how long have you lived here?About nine years. When I first moved here, I shared the apartment with a girlfriend from Krefeld.KFF Trix chair by Karl-Friedrich Förster next to a vintage chest of drawers. Atop of the chest of drawers, a range of objects from an Art Deco tea service by Christian Fjerdingstad to a 3D-printed vase and a silver bowl. How many people have lived here in total?I think nine including me. Almost everyone was from Krefeld. I’ve been living here on my own for about a year now.How has the apartment changed over time?Of course, my flatmates used to have their own styles in their own rooms. But the style of my room would be recognizable today. It was always a combination of new and old elements, and I still maintain that same mix.The striped armchair in the dining room was a free find via a classified ad. The side table is also vintage. On the wall: All that Ramana Maharshi Told Us by Gregory Borlein, 2023. Holthaus likes to combine contemporary and vintage objects, such as the Biedermeier chest of drawers with the Giraffa lamp by Jonathan Bocca in the dining room. The painting on the wall hung in her parents living room as did the small picture on the wall to the left. The framed work atop the stack of books is Just Two Little Spritzers, by Veronika Günther, 2023. Where did you buy your furniture?I bought most of it at flea markets or from classified ads. I don’t think I own a single piece of furniture that cost more than 1300 euros. I think it’s good to show people that you don’t have to buy all your furniture from a catalog, and that objects are beautiful when they have a story to tell. Every piece of furniture I have has its own story, as does every room. For example, I always paint rooms when I’m feeling heartbroken. [Laughs.] The kitchen was my first painting project.How do you handle color? Judging by the hallway, you’re very brave.I think colors are very important. However, they have to adapt to the architecture. When I think about it, I realize that perhaps I first had to get to know my home in order to know what it needs. Over time, you develop a different relationship to colors and you see how a room responds to a particular hue. But, of course, it takes some courage to experiment with color. My friends have already commented on the ceiling in the hallway and how they don’t know what to make of it. But I do!A green party in the kitchen: ceiling light (Ferm Living), marble tray (H\u0026M Home), wine glasses (Studio Riviera), Ottoni kettle (Bodum). Above the Art Nouveau bed hangs a picture of an angel, a gift from her father. A vintage Panthella lamp from Louis Poulsen is on the bedside table, next to it a candlestick from Ystad. Bed linens (Hay). The butterfly image is also a vintage find. How do you decide what to purchase?That’s a good question. Intuition comes into play here too. Of course, I also do a lot of research in newspapers, books, magazines, and on Pinterest. But I also get inspiration while traveling and from friends. Once I have a rough idea of what I want to do, I usually create a small mood board. Then I build everything up slowly. A room is rarely done, with everything complete. If it were, then I wouldn’t be able to discover anything new to add to it. After all, everything evolves.Are there always a lot of changes in your interiors?Definitely! I don’t buy items specifically for a particular room; I buy what I like. If something doesn’t fit exactly, it just has to wait a little until the right place is found for it.What else is important to you when furnishing and decorating an interior?It’s important to keep surprising people. For example, the bright red hat in the dining room doesn’t really have any particular purpose, and that’s exactly why the eye lingers on it. Not just because it’s an interesting object, but also because it’s hung in an unusual way. I also place small, interesting objects everywhere that tell a story and that you have to think about a little when you see them for the first time. This can also be observed in my store. Customers come back because they don’t immediately grasp everything. It’s also important to me that books that inspired me and led to a certain table setting are always visible. Books are also always part of my work. They usually provide a great basis for conversation. Two years ago, I was given the book Fragebogen (Questionnaire) by Max Frisch as a gift, which is a perfect conversation starter.The framed quote hangs diagonally above the Ettore Memphis armchair: “There are good people. There are bad people. There are Krefeld people.” Wall lamp (Vistosi), vase (Salon c/o). A photograph by artist Jürgen Klauke hangs above Joe Colombo’s B-Line trolley. Stainless-steel cups (Studio Priori), Please Try Again by Veronika Günther. How do you deal with mementos?Of course, there are objects that perhaps no longer work for me aesthetically, but which are still part of my life and remind me of a certain time. For example, this chair by Thonet was the first chair that I bought at an auction. It may not fit the interior quite as well as it used to, but I still can’t part with it because it’s also a beautiful memento. Or the picture above the Biedermeier chest of drawers in the dining room. It used to hang in our living room in Düsseldorf. Above my bed, there’s a picture of a little angel, which has been above my bed since I was born.It seems like you aren’t adding anything new?I wouldn’t say that. There’s an IKEA wardrobe in the hallway which I bought for purely practical reasons. The Memphis chair is new, and I made the curtains for the canopy in the living room myself. But I don’t think I buy as many new things because I also like to spend that money instead on art and to support young artists.Carafe from Christofle (Salon c/o). You have a lot of art in your home. How do you choose which works to buy?Art has to captivate me. A good example is the work by Andrej Maxim Auch. I looked at his works at the Academy in Munich and I initially had a completely different work in mind, but it wasn’t available. Then I got stuck on this particular one, which is now hanging in my hallway. It is a little disturbing. But I think that’s what art sometimes does; it triggers something in you, be it enthusiasm or irritation. I think it’s also good to establish a connection to artists. If I see a work that appeals to me, but I don’t connect with the person behind it, I tend to be hesitant about buying it.Do you have a special work of art that is close to your heart?In the living room, there’s Fleck (Stain), also by Andrej, which is my absolute favorite painting. It was also the biggest art purchase I’d ever made. And without my planning it, it fits the room perfectly. I could look at it for hours and I always find something new.You have also been organizing events in your apartment for some time now. How did that come about?That was always one of my plans. I realized how exciting I found it to visit other people’s spaces. When you meet in an intimate space, you remember the event in a completely different way. A place needs warmth and heart. And all of this ties into the idea of hospitality. It’s easier to warmly welcome someone in private spaces.Finally, what are the main ingredients for creating an atmosphere that feels inviting?I think the themes of color, materiality, and personal objects are very important, but also art. And of course a lot of intuition.The tureen in the bathroom is from Villeroy \u0026 Boch, Holthaus placed it atop a vintage cupboard. Towels (Zara Home), towel rail and soap dish (Hay). Shell game: Brass casings are repurposed as vases. Cutlery and napkins (Salon c/o). Yellow bowl (IKEA), Tamegroute bowl (Salon c/o), cutlery (Bent Falk for Menu). Verena Holthaus. The robe by Alva Morgaine is the perfect counterpart for the blue wall. The vases and picture are vintage finds.

Once I have a rough idea of what I want to do, I usually create a small mood board. Then I build everything up slowly. A room is rarely done, with everything complete.

For example, the bright red hat in the dining room doesn’t really have any particular purpose, and that’s exactly why the eye lingers on it. Not just because it’s an interesting object, but also because it’s hung in an unusual way. I also place small, interesting objects everywhere that tell a story and that you have to think about a little when you see them for the first time. This can also be observed in my store. Customers come back because they don’t immediately grasp everything. It’s also important to me that books that inspired me and led to a certain table setting are always visible. Books are also always part of my work. They usually provide a great basis for conversation.

Or the picture above the Biedermeier chest of drawers in the dining room. It used to hang in our living room in Düsseldorf.

But I think that’s what art sometimes does; it triggers something in you, be it enthusiasm or irritation. I think it’s also good to establish a connection to artists.
