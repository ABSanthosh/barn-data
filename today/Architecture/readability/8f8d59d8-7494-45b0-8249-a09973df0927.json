  "text": "Can sound define space? If brooks can babble and the wind can whistle, who’s to say walls can’t talk? Curious co-hosts Faraz Shah and Ella Hazard pose this question in the fifth episode of their podcast Sense of Space where the duo explores the subtleties of architecture’s aural experience. Presented by Turf and the SURROUND Podcast Network, this conversation takes listeners on an oral journey to find the parallels between music and design. Shah and Hazard approach the subject with a deep reverence for music and wholistic design that regards architecture as an artistic practice. The two present the work of multi-hyphenate creative Bryan Black, also known as Black Asteroid, as a case study, whose from-scratch sounds are responses to visual stimuli that often inspires the production. Buildings, cities, and even skylines have a way of eliciting soundtracks or lyrical musings reflected in songs, which eventually inspire designers when scene building with tangible materials. The co-hosts celebrate connections within the shared heritage between architects, designers, and musicians pointing out a common thread through the visual media, music, or even fashion. No matter the genre, the goal is often to craft some kind of experience for someone else. Shah also draws connections between the devices that make music memorable in the same way interiors are made interesting. “You use pattern in space, often with repetition to set expectations. And I think electronic music is the same way. But then you have to find ways to create these moments of surprise and delight,” Shah says. “You interrupt that pattern, you break it. And I think that’s the thing that’s so interesting about all of this – it’s the same principles, different mediums.” Hazard continues by building on the previous idea introducing the concept of tempo or pace, citing apps that match musical stylings to the speed of physical movement. How might segments of circulation through a building sound, and in what ways could a tune tempt listeners to explore new architectural territory? These points represent just a sliver of sound bites tackling the craft, creation, and spatial experiences cataloged in episode five leaving listeners a little more attuned to their surroundings – are you ready to listen?
