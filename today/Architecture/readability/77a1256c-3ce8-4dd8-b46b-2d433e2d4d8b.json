  "text": "Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, is officially heading to the 90210. The rapper bought a Beverly Hills mansion for $35 million under an LLC in an off-market deal, per TMZ. The purchase comes after the failed renovation of his former Malibu home, which he purchased in 2021, gutted, and left abandoned. The property was originally designed by Japanese starchitect Tadao Ando in 2013 and sold to Ye for $57.3 million. After controversy and legal issues surrounding his plans to turn the beachfront abode into a “1910s-inspired concrete bomb shelter,” the musician listed the estate for sale in December 2023. It was later listed with Selling Sunset’s Jason Oppenheim and sold in September 2024 for $21 million—a whopping loss of $36.3 million.But the multi-million dollar slash clearly didn’t put too much of a dent in West’s wallet. The Heartless singer’s new pad is a gated 20,000 square foot mansion in the celebrity-studded neighborhood North Beverly Park. The estate is perched on nearly seven acres of land, per TMZ. It reportedly features 11 bedrooms and 18 bathrooms, with an “entertainment pavilion” connected to the main house. Other amenities in Ye’s manse include a resort-style waterfall pool, along with another pool for swimming laps, a pool house, and a luxe gazebo. There is also an on-ground paddle tennis court. Ye has yet to confirm whether he plans to reconstruct his new abode.Shop Open DoorLove celebrity homes?

The home was purchased by Belwood Investments owner Bo Belmont, who told the Los Angeles Times that he plans to invest $8 million to “restore [the house] right back to what it was” and “as though Kanye was never there.”",
