Select your winners using the A+Awards Judging Criteria as a guide. Share the voting link with your community and encourage them to vote, too! For over a decade, Architizer’s A+Awards have celebrated the world’s best architecture — not just the buildings that look great, but the ones that do great things, inspiring other designers to continue pushing the bounds of the profession. A+Awards winners set a bar for global design standards. Now in its 13th year, the world’s largest architectural awards program is back with a powerful theme: Rewarding local innovation with global recognition. VOTE NOW \u003e Across the globe, architects are balancing universal challenges — from climate change to rapid urbanization — with the specifics of local conditions, cultures and communities. This year’s finalists reflect that mission in full, demonstrating how buildings can be at once globally relevant and deeply rooted in place. By voting, you’ll also get a sneak peak at the world’s top architectural projects, the finalists narrowed down by Architizer’s prestigious jury. Finalists in Hall / Theater (from left): Kuwait University’s Convocation Hall by Skidmore, Owings \u0026 Merrill (SOM); Nanchang Grand Theatre by PES-Architects; New Bund 31 Performing Arts Center by Neri\u0026Hu Design and Research Office; Unique Henan · Land of Drama by Beijing Institute of Architectural Design; Teatro Borsoni by Botticini + Facchinelli ARW  Finalists in Restaurants (L\u003e1000 sq ft) (from top): Hanbury Hall by Howells; Big Red Crayfish by Dayi Design; The View by Rockwell Group; Aruma Split Garden by RAD+AR; Noodle In Transit by Office AIO.  Finalists in Architecture +Brick (from left): 64 University Place__Kohn Pedersen Fox (KPF); Du House, Pingchuan by TAOA; Tianjin Zhongshuge bookstore by X+LIVING; A House Looking to a Cedrus Tree by Cedrus Architecture Studio; Academia Atlas by Sordo Madaleno. Unlike the closed-door panels of other major awards, the A+Awards embraces a democratic approach. Each Popular Choice winner is selected by you — the global public — offering a fresh perspective that’s grounded in real, everyday experience. You don’t need a design degree to know when something works — or, if you do have such credentials, your expertise matters just as much as the big names that sit on our jury. VOTE NOW \u003e As you’ll see by perusing the finalists, this year’s cohort doesn’t play it safe. These are projects that could only emerge from the places they are from, offering exemplary solutions that may not be on the radar of architects’ elsewhere — whether through innovative materials and detailing, passive heating and cooling strategies, community-led construction or bold urban integration. They’re proof that the future of architecture is as hopeful as it is innovative. Finalists in Sustainable Multi-Unit Residential Building (from top): Moos by concrete amsterdam; Meander Housing by Steven Holl Architects; The Park by KoningEizenberg Architecture; 6 HPP Ses Veles Puigpunyent by Fortuny – Alventosa Morell Arquitectes; Rose des Vents _ Student housing by ADHOC Architectes  Finalists in Sustainable Cultural Building (from left): Weinan-Qiaoma Village Cultural Center by Xi ‘an University of Architecture and Technology Design and Research Institute; Duling Educational and Cultural Centre by Project Mingde; Zero-Carbon Origami Airplane — Shanghai Lin’gang Starry Sky Theme Park Visitor Service Center by China Architecture Design \u0026 Research Group; Tekαkαpimək Contact Station by Saunders Architecture; Wencheng Biology Expo Park by The Design Institute of Landscape \u0026 Architecture China Academy of Art.

We ask you to approach the projects with fresh perspectives and discernment, disregarding names and locales. Consider: Does this project elevate our world? Does it ignite inspiration? Is it genuinely groundbreaking? If so, champion it and applaud the most extraordinary endeavors crafted by visionary architects worldwide. Now is the time to bring global recognition to local innovation. A+Awards winners are paragons of design excellence, representing leaders who chart the course for the profession’s future, and we want to cast a spotlight on groundbreaking work in all corners of the globe. Our democratic voting process is designed to forge a new path toward a more sustainable and equitable built environment. Join us in reclaiming architecture’s narrative. Cast your vote and celebrate the awe-inspiring projects, alongside the dedicated individuals who brought them to life: VOTE NOW \u003e Top image: Woven Passage to Cloudy Peaks by line+ studio",
