  "text": "shiv nader school winds through 1,400 trees in chennai, indiaVastushilpa Sangath’s Shiv Nader School in Chennai, India, is unified by a sweeping red roof that weaves through existing vegetation, creating a porous campus that intertwines architecture and ecology. Built around 1,400 mature trees the school is composed of low-slung, modular structures linked by deep verandahs and shaded courtyards. Designed to grow in phases, the campus is thoughtfully responsive to both its climate and context, treating the site’s natural, cultural, and hydrological layers as integral parts of its design logic.The architects have devised the design language by looking to Tamil traditions, particularly the Chettinad thali, a composition of varied dishes served on a banana leaf. This is reimagined here as a sequence of spatial experiences, unfolding through a series of modest, dispersed volumes unified by sweeping curved roofs and deep verandahs. These transitional spaces also become functional learning environments in their own right, remaining shaded, open, and deeply rooted in local traditions of gathering and exchange.all images by Edmund SumnerVastushilpa Sangath stages the campus as a loop of low volumesVastushilpa Sangath’s master plan breaks the built mass into modular units organized in a loop that is adjusted around the existing trees based on their age, species, and ecological significance.
