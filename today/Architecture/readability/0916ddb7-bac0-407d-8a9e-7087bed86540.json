  "text": "October 7, 2024 AODA Interior Design Co. has shared photos of an apartment interior in Taiwan they recently completed, that includes a variety of design elements specifically for the home owners cats. The clients are a couple with four cats and two medium-to-large dogs. Previously, they lived in a rental property where all the animals shared the same space, lacking vertical separation. This environment led to issues between the cats and dogs. The design concept for the apartment was to create a harmonious living environment for humans and their pets. This included vertical elements such as cat trees, elevated walkways, and multi-level platforms to provide necessary space for the cats to climb and explore, adding visual interest and unique aesthetics. A central wall unit provides a place to mount the television, but also includes shelving for the cats to perch on, as well bubbles for the cats to look out from while feeling protected. Throughout the project, the designers selected robust and easy-to-clean materials to achieve a pet-friendly and durable interior. Floors were covered with scratch-resistant and non-slip surfaces for safety and comfort, while walls and furniture had non-toxic, washable finishes to ensure health and safety. Natural materials like wood and stone were incorporated to create a warm atmosphere. Privacy screens with black frames have been placed along the windows and on top of cabinets, which also have openings for the cats to hide. Other elements include cat scratching posts and openings to a kitty litter box hidden from view. Here’s a look at the floor plan for the apartment. Photography by Studio YHLAA",
