On October 16, an Opening Night Gala benefiting the Fine Arts Museums of America kicks off the international art, antiques, and design fair.

Photography Courtesy of East ForkThe categorical devastation that Hurricane Helene has ensued across the American southeast is still being measured, as citizens in locales previously thought to be protected from such weather patterns are now coping with the aftermath of the severe storm. One of the many profoundly affected businesses is East Fork, the Asheville, North Carolina–based pottery brand helmed by Alex Matisse, who, without water or power, is calling for support. As of last week, East Fork launched a special sale—30% off all pottery with slight imperfections, though all are still completely functional—with 5% of sales donated to grassroots organizations in the region providing aid, such as food relief efforts for those in western North Carolina. Additional donations can be made upon checkout, which will be passed directly to these programs.AD PRO Hears……that—amid Hurricane Helene’s billions of dollars of damage and a Category 5 hurricane anticipated to soon hit Florida—Zillow has announced a new feature that will identify climate risks for for-sale property listings across the US, as well as insurance requirements for such hazards. Because, indeed, climate change affects your home value.ProductFive covetable highlights from London Design FestivalThe 22nd edition of the London Design Festival was held last month, and once again the city pulsated with colorful installations, insightful panels, and parties that fostered memorable connections. All this buzz made it a ripe time for product reveals too, and AD editors instantly grew smitten with a handful of new designs.Take the Muffin collection spotted at George Smith’s Kings Road showroom: a fusion of the English heritage maker’s expertise with AD100 practice Commune Design’s distinctive California point of view. The collaborators’ versatile sofa, armchair, chaise, and ottoman are defined by curvaceous Art Deco silhouettes and wrapped in crushed velvet evocative of Jean-Michel Frank. Modern and old-world sensibilities also unite in the eight-piece upholstered furniture collection from Todhunter Earle Interiors. The latest works from the London studio were hand-built in the Cotswolds by Lorfords Contemporary. Unveiled at Design Centre Chelsea Harbour’s Focus/24 show, the collection's bench, sofas, and armchairs made a splash with elegant details like scrolled arms, bullion fringe, and plump French down cushions.Both ranges pair beautifully with Tulipa, the urn-like glass vases, candle sconces, pendant lights, and mirrors from New York–based French American designer Sophie Lou Jacobsen that pull from de Gournay’s chinoiserie wallpapers. An extension of Jacobsen’s Giardino Segreto series, their pink, yellow, and amber hues mesmerized at de Gournay’s Chelsea showroom styled with the help of New York antique dealer Christoper Cawley. The overall vignette transported visitors to romantic early 20th-century European salons.Similarly, vintage vibes is what Matt Hranek, founder and editor of the lifestyle platform Wm Brown, was after when hatching his compact bar trolley with English furniture company Another Country. Crafted from oak and oak-veneered plywood, the piece sports a convenient handlebar and two sleek wheels. Meanwhile, the unveiled Archibald Denim Edition of Poltrona Frau’s iconic Jean-Marie Massaud-designed chair, with its slubbed texture and rows of stitching reminiscent of stonewashed jeans, would be just the place to hole up with a cocktail served from that well-stocked cart.AD PRO Hears…The Simon Porte Jacquemus-curated Lalanne auction opens for bidding on October 10. Photo: Brian W. Ferry…Francophiles, rejoice: acclaimed French fashion designer Simon Porte Jacquemus is curating a collection of François-Xavier Lalanne’s whimsical sculptures for Christie’s. All lots—from the shapeshifting Lapin a Vent de Tourtour to the cheerful yet hollow La Vache Bien Établie I—are from Lalanne’s daughter’s collection. Get your paddles ready—bidding opens tomorrow.…Frette was all aboard at this year’s Monaco Yacht Show. The Italian linens label debuted the latest designs in its bespoke collection of customizable bedding, tableware, and bath linens—all on luxurious view inside the expansive M/Y Frette yacht.…Dunn-Edwards just released its 2025 Color of the Year, adding another notch to this season’s earthbound belt: Caramelized (DET687), a soft fawn reminiscent of lattes and aged terra-cotta, was selected for its vintage appeal and consumers’ curiosities toward saturated hues.Project SpotlightGlass blocks and green stucco rep downtown glamor at the Billy Cotton–designed BridgesFor the past year, chef Sam Lawrence (formerly of Estela), alongside hospitality vets Nicolas Mouchel and Josey Stuart, have been combining their expertise to open a European bistro in Manhattan. To tap into their spot’s downtown ethos, the trio tapped industry titan Billy Cotton to design an interior swank enough to match the food at Bridges. Now, as guests devour heady Comté tarts and sherry-spiked grilled king crab in the 2,300-square-foot space, they have AD100 designer Billy Cotton to thank for the moody Art Deco–meets–Futurist surroundings. Green stucco pairs with antique Chinese tea paper at Cotton’s inaugural restaurant project, which first entices diners with a glass brick foyer that nods to Chatham Square’s brutalist architecture. This materiality sets the tone for a dining room that mingles rich cherry wood and leather banquettes with red marble-embedded concrete floors, lit above by gleaming chrome fixtures from neighboring design studio Blue Green Works.ExhibitionsA hundred years of Svenskt TennEstrid Ericson founded Svenskt Tenn in 1924, and the Stockholm store and studio have been synonymous with Swedish interiors ever since. At nearby gallery Liljevalchs, where Ericson frequently exhibited, London-based Jane Withers and Svenskt Tenn’s own Karin Södergren have curated Svenskt Tenn: A Philosophy of Home (on view through January 12) to honor Ericson’s legacy. Shaped in large part by Svenskt Tenn’s long-term collaboration with Austrian architect and designer Josef Frank beginning in the 1930s, the centenary retrospective unfurls in 13 rooms. Vibrant table settings, textiles, and furniture in each pay tribute to different eras of the company’s history. Look for 1920s pewter objects and the soft, cocooning 1934 Liljevalchs sofa—Frank’s first piece for Svenskt Tenn—as well as his and Ericson’s São Paulo living room, conceived for the Swedish Consul in the 1950s. These installations are rounded out by archival treasures such as Frank’s never-before-seen pattern drawings and glimpses into the craftsmanship (see: cane bending and cabinet making) that feature prominently in Svenskt Tenn designs.Vibrant architectural drawings take over A83The drawing submission from Young Projects defies the bounds of architectural convention. Photo: Bryan YoungFor its ongoing Architectural Drawing series, nonprofit printmaking studio and gallery A83 tasks emerging architects and designers to share their architectural drawings through the experimental lens of the studio’s printmaking. The third installment of the exhibition series, featuring fantastical, large-format silkscreens by Bureau Spectacular, Drawing Architecture Studio, Gore/Hall, Gus Crain, Michael Robinson Cohen, MOS, and Young Projects, is now on view through November 17 at the A83 Gallery in New York.AD PRO Hears……sculptural wunderkind Brian Rochefort’s latest surrealist creations are on view at Sean Kelly—his first exhibition with the gallery after gaining representation this year. If you’re on the West Coast and in the mood for some terrestrial, avant-garde ceramics, look no further than “Staring at the Moon” (through November 2).OpeningsIn LA, Armani/Casa exits the design center for a sunny street-level façadeLast month’s grand opening of Armani/Casa on N Robertson Boulevard in Los Angeles means more than just sophisticated new digs—the 3,500-square-foot standalone store marks the label’s first foray away from design center showrooms. The façade’s plaster white coat carries into the bilevel boutique’s modern interior, brand classics including the curved Classic Tub chair, tripod-shaped Ramage floor lamp, and hand-knotted striped Max rug are on display. After a stroll through the stylish showroom, take a break on the secluded backyard terrace and courtyard, which showcases Armani/Casa’s recently introduced outdoor collection. Teak loungers topped with performance jacquard cushions? Don’t mind if we do.",
