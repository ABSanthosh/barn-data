  "text": "Rupert Murdoch has finally found a buyer for his luxe Flatiron penthouse. The multi-billionaire media tycoon, who currently owns Fox News and News Corp, sold his triplex at One Madison for roughly $23.8 million, per Crain’s New York Business.Though this sale price is hefty by any standards, it is $20 million less than Murdoch paid. The magnate originally bought the three-floor pad in 2014 for $43 million, along with an additional unit below it for $14 million. In 2022, he listed the 6,580-square-foot property for $62 million and the secondary unit for $16 million. The latter space—a three-bedroom on the 57th floor often used as a guest suite—sold in October 2022 for $12.5 million. Since then, the Fox News founder made several adjustments to the triplex listing, taking the property on and off the market and slashing the price, including a recent markdown in June from $38.5 million to $28.5 million.“My client is a realist, and he is very astute about how markets function,” Kyle Blackmon, the head of luxury sales at Compass, who represented the property, told Crain’s about the price reduction in June. The buyer has yet to be revealed, but city records confirm that an LLC tied to Murdoch sold the home.Murdoch’s freshly-offloaded unit spans the top three highest floors of the 60-story One Madison tower. The multi-floor condo, renovated during his decade-long residence, features five-bedrooms with accompanying ensuite bathrooms, floor-to-ceiling windows open to 360-degree views of Manhattan, a wrap-around terrace, and a private elevator. The building boasts luxury amenities including a doorman, concierge, fitness center, and pool.Shop Open DoorLove celebrity homes?

While the Australian-born mogul is saying farewell to Midtown for now, he still has a global real estate portfolio and a 6,500-square-foot abode on Central Park South, which he acquired in 2023 at $35.2 million, to fall back on. The seven-bedroom townhouse sits on the 27th floor of Hampshire House, the same building where Murdoch previously lived during the ‘90s.",
