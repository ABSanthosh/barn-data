  "text": "anchor Lakisha Ann Woods. Image courtesy of AIA The American Institute of Architects (AIA) has announced its EVP/Chief Executive Officer Lakisha Ann Woods will be stepping down from the post in February of next year, following a misconduct scandal that sparked outcries about organizational leadership, corporate spending, and nepotism. Woods was cleared of any wrongdoing by an independent investigation in August, which prompted the AIA Board of Directors to file an ethics complaint against her accusers in September. She has served as EVP/CEO since being named to the position in November 2021.  Related: AIA Board of Directors files ethics complaint against misconduct accusersAIA President Kimberly Dowdell, lauded her tenure in saying: \"[The] AIA is losing an incredible talent in EVP/CEO Woods, but we were so fortunate to have benefited from her leadership for three years. She is a leader among leaders, and those who have had the opportunity to collaborate with her understand how much of a loss this is to our organization and the profession of architecture. Woods leaves AIA in a stronger financial position than when she started, and we appreciate her expertise and fortitude in achieving this goal.\" Woods, who made history as the first Black woman to serve in the post, said: \"It has been an honor to serve as CEO of AIA working alongside such talented and dedicated professionals and members. I am proud of the accomplishments we have achieved together, and I am confident that AIA will continue to evolve in the years to come.\" Taking her place on an interim basis will be Stephen T. Ayers, the former Architect of the Capitol and interim CEO of the National Institute of Building Sciences since 2021. The AIA says it will now \"engage in a comprehensive search process to identify Woods’ successor\" starting in 2025.",
