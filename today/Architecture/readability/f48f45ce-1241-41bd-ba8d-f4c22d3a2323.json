With irregular topography and surrounded by water at the rear, the project expands its views and engages in dialogue with the surroundings, where transparency and privacy play significant roles in the domestic experience. The house creates spaces through exploration, with a double-height internal patio serving as the central axis that distributes the various areas. The lateral exterior portico establishes a dual rhythm: privacy and solidity towards the street, and transparency and lightness towards the lagoon. Reinforced concrete, marble, and glass provide strength and transparency, while wood and vegetation act as counterpoints that balance the domestic space, giving it scale and making it habitable.all images courtesy of Seta StudioCasa Pevi centers around a fully open living-dining areaThe design team at Seta Studio achieves open spaces and a fully open living-dining area by employing mixed structural techniques. The use of iron and reinforced concrete allowed for the removal of interior supports. Various construction techniques and materials combine to create a project that is not only visually striking but also functional, comfortable, and low-maintenance in the long term. To enhance the expressive quality of the overall design, two formwork techniques were used: vertical elements with boarding and smooth horizontal ones.reinforced concrete, marble, and glass balance strength and transparency in the designthe lagoon-facing side features large, glass openings for uninterrupted viewsSeta Studio experiments with geometric concrete volumes",
