  "text": "Tom Brady is considering cashing in on the Bezos effect that has jacked up prices in the wealthy Miami enclave known as Indian Creek Island, according to Bloomberg. The outlet reports that the retired quarterback has been quietly showing his custom-built estate on the manmade Florida landmass, which has been nicknamed Billionaire Bunker due to its high-net-worth inhabitants. Though it has not been officially listed, the house has fetched bids topping $150 million, according to Bloomberg.Jeff Bezos began scooping up properties on the island in 2023. Since then, he has accumulated three Indian Creek parcels, costing him more than $230 million in total. The Amazon founder’s presence has apparently skyrocketed the value of land in the exclusive Biscayne Bay area; an empty plot of land next door to Bezos that last sold in 2018 for $27.5 million recently listed for $200 million. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner also live there, and Adriana Lima once called the 300-acre island home.Brady and his former wife, supermodel Gisele Bündchen, bought the roughly two-acre property in 2020 for $17 million and then built an eco-friendly mansion designed by architect Scott Mitchell on the land. The former New England Patriot kept the dwelling following his 2022 divorce. According to Zillow, the plot’s 2023 assessed value was about $28.6 million.Join NowBecome an AD PRO member for only $25 $20 per month + receive an exclusive toteArrowPer Bloomberg, the current record for the most expensive single-family home transaction in the Miami area clocks in at $107 million—that was what hedge funder Ken Griffin paid for a Coconut Grove property in 2022.Brady has shared glimpses of his Billionaire Bunker home to his Instagram account. Last November, he posted a photo of the pad’s modern concrete façade, which features a flat roof and floor-to-ceiling windows. “Home is where the Heart is,” the California native captioned a snap of an infinity pool bordered by palm trees in March.",
