You can only surround yourself with things that you really love and need,” designer Regina Hoefter says. She would know, having lived in a 430-square-foot Munich apartment in the Maxvorstadt District, near the lively Elisabethmarkt, for 10 years. The unit, located in an older building, was completely renovated. “The floor plan was entirely reorganized in a very efficient way, which makes the two-room apartment appear much larger,” she explains. High ceilings, tall doors, oversized windows, and a herringbone parquet floor with oversized proportions were also key to creating the illusion of extra space.AD100 Germany architect and interior designer Regina Hoefter. A compact—not cramped—430-square-foot Munich apartmentThe floor plan of Regina Hoefter’s two-room apartment illustrates the careful thought behind its layout. Jean Sebastien MalebrancheHoefter’s apartment is far from feeling like a sterile and functional space. As soon as you enter, you’re struck by the fact that this home feels lived in. It’s an eclectic interior that invites you to pause and take a closer look at an antique piece of furniture, a portrait, or an especially striking light fixture and ponder the story behind the object. Hoefter grew up in an environment where art and design played large roles and she learned early on to appreciate different styles and eras. Today, when she works with clients, she places antique and vintage finds in contemporary contexts.“It was important to me not just to preserve a mix of eras, but to continue to build it and integrate it into my own style,” she says. The decor of her home wasn’t planned in advance following a preconceived concept. Instead it grew organically incorporating furniture, art, and objects that she inherited or received as gifts from her parents and grandparents. “I would never have chosen many of these pieces myself, but their emotional value makes them irreplaceable. For me, they are not just furniture or mere decoration. They reflect lived moments and emotional memories. There are natural differences and contrasts that give a unique life to the apartment as a whole.”It’s not a coincidence that many small apartments have round tables. Eero Saarinen’s Tulip Table seats five guests on chairs by Josef Hillerbrand (which were once owned by Hoefter’s grandparents). The Onos 55 pendant light is a design by Florian Schulz. How to organize a small space, which furniture and lights should you choose, and what other strategies should you keep in mind? Hoefter shares some insights.#1. Small apartment = small furniture?“Not at all. I think it’s okay to be daring when it comes to proportions. It’s the unexpected that often adds a certain unique element to an apartment.”#2. Be conscious about your purchases“If you are limited when it comes to room, buy only things that you really love and need. Consider it a welcome opportunity to be conscious about the things you acquire.”#3. Create structure without resorting to partitions“With art, carpets, and lights, you can create zones in a room which don’t require internal partitions or dividers.”Everything is in one room and yet each area stands on its own. The living area is defined by a Moroccan carpet while the side table by Felix Muhrhofer and Kelly Wearstler, the vintage sofa, and the table lamp by Masayuki Kurokawa combine to form a coherent unit. The window corner follows the school of mix and match with Hoefter hanging paintings by a number of different artists in a vertical column. #4. Sorting art“I group works of art by themes, to give some sense of organization. Small format pieces should be hung with others of the same size to create a certain visual density. I also like to hang art on top of each other and a little higher than is typical, which leads me to my next point...”Hoefter likes to combine small-format pictures, both heirlooms and flea market finds, into groups. They then combine to create a new and unique work of art composed of the different elements. Three generations: The paintings in the bedroom show Regina Hoefter’s grandmother, her mother, and herself. The interior designer combines the Hillerbrand side table, which was owned by her grandparents, with an armchair by Luigi Caccia Dominioni from 1975. #5. Look Up“I use vertical elements to emphasize the height of a room. For example, I’ll hang long curtains, place a floor lamp atop a chest of drawers, or a hang a pendant lamp on a very long cable so that it floats above a bedside table. These elements fill the vertical space of a room and have the effect of making it feel larger.”Thinking different: In the bedroom, a 1960s floor lamp adds a jaunty touch sitting atop a chest of drawers once owned by her grandparents while further emphasizing the space’s high ceilings. #6. Lighting is key“Light fixtures are important elements, especially in rooms with high ceilings. I use the whole arsenal of wall, pendant, and floor lamps to illuminate different levels of the room and create a cozy atmosphere.”A lamp by Hans-Agne Jakobsson on an extra-long cable floats above Gianfranco Frattini’s 1960s bedside table. Different light sources illuminate different levels. The right-hand corner of the living area, with works of art by Bram Bogart, Nina Kirste, and Giorgioppi is illuminated by a pair of brass wall lamps by Josef Hillerbrand. The three-legged stool is from a flea market.",
