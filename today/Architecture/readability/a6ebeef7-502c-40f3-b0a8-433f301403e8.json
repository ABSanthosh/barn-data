  "text": "yiiie architects presents community art creative project (cacp)The Community Art Creative Project (CACP) by YIIIE Architects has revitalized an abandoned bicycle shed in China into a vibrant public space that encourages recycling, community involvement, and sustainable urban living. Designed as a collaborative intervention in informal, ‘leftover’ urban areas, the project combines modular light steel construction, terraced green roofs, and locally sourced materials to engage marginalized communities while addressing the challenges of rapid urbanization.Situated in Yulin 2nd Alley, a dense urban center marked by partially demolished red-brick buildings, the site serves as a hub for low-income groups, migrants, minorities, and indigenous residents. Once a bustling urban landmark, the space had become stagnant over decades of neglect. Through an interdisciplinary approach blending architecture, design, sociology, and art, CACP transforms this ‘waiting land’ into a community-driven experiment in adaptability and resilience.all images courtesy of YIIIE Architectsa community intervention in a ‘leftover’ urban pocketYIIIE Architects’ (see more here) design integrates nature through rotated units and roof plantings that create zigzag boundaries, with sawtooth gaps bringing in more greenery and further enhancing public orientation. The exposed structure supports ongoing modifications, while the planted roof serves as a community garden and provides cooling benefits and scenic green views while fostering collective maintenance of public gardens.Low-cost, locally sourced, and recycled materials have been employed, resulting in a dynamic, accordion-like spatial hierarchy. Transparent polycarbonate panels and a lightweight galvanized steel structure maximize natural lighting while creating a soft and airy aesthetic. The structure provides further possibilities for a participatory construction and ongoing spatial updates, with adaptable modular units. These design choices establish a friendly, adaptable environment that welcomes diverse community interactions. Within just seven days, the CACP team, 30 volunteers, and local residents collaboratively assembled the main structure.a dense urban center marked by partially demolished red-brick buildingsa meeting point for workshops, meetings, and exhibitionsThe revitalized space serves as a venue for workshops, meetings, and exhibitions, connecting local stakeholders while fostering community resilience. Activities like furniture renovation, community meetings, and artistic interventions also address social challenges and empower local vendors. The space’s flexible and open design emphasizes the importance of process, allowing continuous feedback and refinement to ensure lasting impact. Future plans for the site include integrating commercial operations, such as florist shops, alongside public activities, creating a balance between community use and business opportunities. CACP aims to extend this model to other aging courtyards, inspiring further dialogue on the role of community commerce in preserving local culture. YIIIE and CACP’s work bridges the gap between top-down government initiatives and grassroots community actions. By establishing alliances among local youth, resident groups, and governmental bodies, the project highlights the potential of informal urban spaces to evolve into vibrant hubs of social, ecological, and economic activity.YIIIE Architects presents Community Art Creative Project (CACP)a vibrant public space that encourages recycling, community involvement, and sustainable urban livingthe site was once an abandoned bicycle shedthe project combines modular light steel construction and locally sourced materialsthe revitalized space serves as a venue for workshops, meetings, and exhibitions, connecting local stakeholderstopped with terraced green roofsthe zigzag boundaries and sawtooth gaps bring in more greenery and further enhance public orientationwithin just seven days, the CACP team, 30 volunteers, and local residents assembled the main structure",
