  "text": "Kamakura Studio’s residence in japan doubles as community hubKamakura Studio introduces House F, a home and office for an architect in Chiba, Japan, that doubles as a community hub. Situated in a rapidly evolving neighborhood, the residence introduces a flexible first-floor space where neighbors gather over coffee and films. At its core, a diagonal, south-facing void entwines lush greenery, reflecting the plant-sharing culture of the area. The facade of the residence shifts in perception—its north-facing elevation steps back toward the sky, where shared greenery flourishes, while the west-facing facade offers a distinct, ever-changing impression to passersby. House F proposes a model for sustainable urban communities where daily life extends beyond individual thresholds to nurture collective belonging.all images by Kouji Fujii / Shinkenchiku-sha, courtesy of Kamakura Studioa wood stove fills house f with warmth through vertical voidWith adaptability in mind, the Japanese architects at Kamakura Studio designed the first-floor office to invite spontaneous visits, positioning the home as an accessible social space rather than an enclosed private retreat. The defining feature of House F is its vertical void, which connects all floors while channeling light and heat from a first-floor wood stove. This spatial conduit boosts warmth and airflow and serves as a visual and functional link between levels, uniting them. On the second floor, an open-plan living-dining kitchen (LDK) space extends onto a balcony laden with edible plants.An atrium further bridges the second and third floors, culminating in a study space designed for children. Here, openness is prioritized, with abundant greenery and strategic sightlines encouraging interaction. Natural light filters through a reflective box, brightening interiors while extending a luminous presence onto the street.
