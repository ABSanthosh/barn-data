  "text": "Tamouz constructs Layered facade for Sarv Office BuildingTamouz Architecture \u0026 Construction Group takes over the design of Sarv Office Building in Tehran, Iran. The office project addresses the tension between opposing concepts such as order/disorder, openness/enclosure, and light/shade through its architectural design. Initially approached for facade approval in June 2017, the design team undertook the construction of the building which presented unique architectural challenges. Its partially constructed form with 100% plot coverage limited the potential for natural light and ventilation, leaving the southern facade as the sole source of airflow.To overcome these limitations, the designers rejected the idea of a flat facade, instead creating a layered structure that serves as both a protective shell and an interactive space between the building and its surroundings. The southern side needed to allow natural light into the building while shielding it from harsh sunlight, balancing transparency with privacy. The design solution involved two layers: large, transparent windows on the interior side, maximizing light and visibility, and a semi-transparent outer layer composed of wooden railings and steel planters. This outer permeable screen functions as a filter, regulating light and air while maintaining privacy for occupants.all images by Mohammad Hassan EttefaghSarv Office Building’s facade Balances Transparency and privacyThe space between these layers acts as a semi-open active zone, blending functional and aesthetic elements and softening the transition between the building and the urban environment. The design team extends this concept to the rooftop, where the design continues the theme of transparency and semi-transparency, offering views and natural light while maintaining a sense of seclusion. Internally, the principles of layering, openness, and controlled interaction with the environment inform the organization of service zones, common areas, and mechanical systems. Each element of the design works in harmony to balance contrasting forces, creating a cohesive structure that engages with its surroundings while addressing practical constraints.Sarv Office Building by Tamouz Architecture balances openness and enclosure in its designthe southern facade introduces layered transparency, optimizing natural light and ventilationthe semi-transparent outer layer is composed of wooden railings and steel plantersthe layered facade functions as a protective shell and interactive zone with the surroundingsthe outer screen acts as a filter, regulating airflow and creating privacy for the occupantslarge transparent windows flood the interiors with light, enhancing visual connections",
