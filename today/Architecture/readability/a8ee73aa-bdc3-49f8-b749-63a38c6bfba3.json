  "text": "Kiss bassist and co-lead singer Gene Simmons has a little problem. “These hard times, you don’t want to say I have too many houses, but we have too many properties,” the shock-rocker told the Wall Street Journal. To address the issue, the musician and reality TV star is offloading his modern Beverly Hills home. The 7,700-square-foot pad has hit the market for just under $14 million.Designed by Swiss architect Roger P. Kurath, the boxy structure was built in 2017 with concrete, glass, oak, and steel. Simmons bought the half-acre property in 2021 for $10.5 million. “My favorite part of the house is waking up in the morning in the upper bedroom, having coffee in bed and on a clear day being able to see all the way out to the ocean,” the musician said in a press release. “The views really are spectacular.” Glass walls allow for indoor-outdoor living and showcase those panoramic vistas—which include mountain, valley, and Pacific Ocean views.The home’s living area.

It incorporates top-of-the-line smart home features, like solar powered heating for the 40-foot infinity pool, which is the crown jewel of the 1,800-square-foot deck space. “It is like a 22nd-century house,” Simmons told the WSJ. “I had to go out and buy a simple microwave so that I could press one button and heat things up because the coffee maker, the cappuccino maker, the time machine, all that stuff was built into the wall—voice activated I might add—was so complex, I couldn’t make it work.”Simmons and his wife, model and actor Shannon Tweed, also maintain a residence in British Columbia, two in Malibu, and homes for each of their two children.",
