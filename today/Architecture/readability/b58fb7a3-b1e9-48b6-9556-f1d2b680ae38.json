  "text": "Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and others may have received top billing in the Dark Knight trilogy of Batman movies, but one uncredited star of the films was its Batmobile, nicknamed the Tumbler. This articulating, low-riding, armored, and heavily-armed vehicle was every bit as compelling as any of the other gadget-laden whips driven by the Caped Crusader during his lengthy reign behind the fictional wheel.Now, for the first time, individuals who have an extra $2.99 million burning a crypto hole through their virtual wallets can purchase an officially sanctioned, drivable (but not street legal) replica of the Batmobile directly from movie studio Warner Bros Discovery’s Global Consumer Products division, and Relevance International, an expert experiential marketing firm. These companies co-produce the Wayne Enterprises Experience, an exclusive online retail shop that sells items that could be used by Bruce Wayne, were he not the imaginary civilian persona of an imaginary superhero. Only 10 Tumblers will be produced for this drop, so if you’re interested in owning one—or any of the other widgets, vehicles, scents, clothing, art, or homes derived from this meta-Möbius comic strip of brand extension retailing—check out the collection of Gotham billionaire–inspired merch at BruceWayneX.com.Photo: Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer Products“The Tumbler was introduced to audiences in the Dark Knight Trilogy as a tactical vehicle and instantly became an icon of Batman lore in cinema,” says Robert Oberschelp, head of global consumer products at Warner Bros. Discovery.“Opening sales on these vehicles, as we celebrate 85 years of Batman throughout pop culture, perfectly represents the brand’s relentless pursuit of exceptional uniqueness and quality.”Each Tumbler will be constructed by Action Vehicle Engineering, a Southern California–based automotive fabrication shop that specializes in conceptualizing and creating specialty and stunt cars for the film, movie, and video gaming industries. Each will be constructed of high-strength exotic materials such as aeronautical steel, Kevlar, and carbon fiber, and equipped with a 525 hp 6.2-liter Chevrolet Performance engine and paddle-shifting automatic transmission. Each will also include a digital dashboard, five-point racing harnesses, smokescreen delivery system, and jet engine simulation. No actual jet engines will be included, as they get a bit flame-y and we imagine would be challenging to insure.Photo: Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer ProductsEach Tumbler will also have a number of special features, made-to-order for the individuals who purchase them. “The exterior of each Tumbler will look the same as they were seen in the Dark Knight Trilogy, however the interiors are being custom-built to each owner’s specifications,” says Oberschelp. “Each vehicle’s driver seat, steering wheel, pedals and more will be custom made, specifically, to fit each individual owner’s physical dimensions and requirements.”This special vehicle will thus approximate, for its owner, some of the joys and sensations of being an actual superhero. But even a $3 million fanboy toy has its limitations. “The Tumbler is the ultimate in iconic design, a collectible work of art, and coveted fantasy purchase,” says Suzanne Rosnowski, founder and CEO of Relevance International. “While we don’t recommend fighting crime with these beauties, this is as close to Batman’s vehicle as you can get.”",
