  "text": "Amidst their ongoing divorce, actor Jessica Alba and film producer Cash Warren have found a buyer for their Beverly Hills home two months after they placed it on the market, Realtor.com reports. Records indicate that the 8,829-square-foot residence entered into contract on June 27; time will tell if it will close at the full $18.995 million asking price.Alba and Warren, who met on the Fantastic Four set in 2004 and share three children, bought the traditional-style dwelling in 2017 for $9.9 million. “We wanted a place to watch our kids play and grow up,” Alba said during a 2019 Architectural Digest home tour of the property. As such, the growing family was on the hunt for a spacious home with a nice backyard. The seven-bedroom, 8.5-bath abode sits on a nearly two-acre plot with a grassy lawn and mature trees, so it fit the bill. “I walked in and knew within 20 minutes, even though [the previous owners’ style] wasn’t our vibe, this was exactly what we were looking for,” Alba explained.To transform it into what would eventually become their “dream house,” the couple tapped Kathleen and Tommy Clements of AD100 firm Clements Design. The mother-and-son design team took the house down to the studs to rework the floor plan into a more open, family-friendly flow. The final product, which features organic materials including reclaimed wood, natural fibers, and marble, took 18 months of renovation.Join NowAD PRO members enjoy exclusive benefits.

Up a sleek architectural staircase, the primary suite houses a fireplace-warmed sitting area, dual dressing rooms, and a luxe bath with a glass-encased shower complete with a soaking tub. Standout amenities include a gym, a theater, and a resort-style swimming pool with a nearby cabana.According to Realtor.com, Warren was seen touring a Sherman Oaks home earlier this month. “I'm proud of how we've grown as a couple and in our marriage over the last 20 years and it's now time for us to embark on a new chapter of growth and evolution as individuals,” Alba wrote in an Instagram post in January.",
