  "text": "A year and a half after buying their midcentury modern LA home, new parents Alexandra Daddario and Andrew Form have parted ways with the pad. As reported by Mansion Global, the White Lotus star and her film producer husband, who welcomed their first baby on Halloween, listed the stylishly renovated Mandeville Canyon house in August. It officially changed hands earlier this week for $2.9 million.Daddario and Form bought the treehouse-inspired abode, which was built in 1959 by surfer-turned-architect Matt Kivlin, for $2.8 million in May 2023. The previous owners were documentary filmmaker Lacey Uhlemeyer and her husband, Rendell Johnson, who welcomed AD’s cameras in for a tour. The 2022 feature highlights the transformative renovations the duo tackled in collaboration with designer Claire Thomas. They sought to restore the dwelling’s midcentury glory following a dated ’80s makeover. Uhlemeyer told AD that the home’s beautiful original design still shone through, which is ultimately what drew her to the property. “What I did see, beyond the chocolate brown painted ceilings and stone tile bathrooms, was a really special post-and-beam architectural treehouse with floor-to-ceiling windows that invite in the gorgeous, protected canyon views,” she said.It appears the Mayfair Witches actor didn’t change much—if anything—about the residence. A loft area with ’60s-style green shag carpet, bare wooden beams, and a serene green primary bathroom with a Japanese-inspired hammered copper tub remain, per listing photos. Lined with glass, the light-flooded great room is centered around a red-tiled hearth that separates the kitchen and dining areas from the living room. A wraparound porch equipped for alfresco dining, a sauna, and a cold plunge round out the amenities in the tree-lined yard.Register TodayAD PRO's 2025 Interior Design Forecast is almost hereArrowIt’s unclear where Daddario and Form have relocated to, but the Percy Jackson actor did share a peek into her baby’s new nursery on Instagram recently; the space features high ceilings, exposed brick, floral-printed drapes, and a built-in sage green shelving unit.",
