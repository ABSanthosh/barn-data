The national average kitchen remodel cost for a minor, mid-range renovation is $27,492, per Remodeling’s 2024 Cost vs. Value Report. When you consider how that often doesn’t even include renovations like moving plumbing fixtures or making changes to the room’s layout, your desire to follow through on your own renovation may start to wane a little bit. As the report’s cost breakdown continues, a more major, mid-range renovation averaged $79,982, while an upscale remodel’s average overall cost came in at $158,530. If you call a major metropolitan city home, the prices are likely to be even higher than that, due to the cost of labor. From budget-friendly options all the way to a high-end dream kitchen, renovations will likely cost homeowners a pretty penny—particularly if you’re dealing with a lot of square footage and looking to totally rework your kitchen design.“Bath and kitchen remodeling projects are the most expensive rooms in the house because they are chock-full of expensive stuff, like kitchen appliances, countertops, cabinets, and [light] fixtures,” says Steve Pallrand of design firm Home Front Build. “That doesn’t even include all the behind-the-scenes, code-required systems to make things work safely, like electrical, plumbing,v and mechanical.”What’s the typical breakdown of costs in a kitchen remodel?When it comes to the breakdown of finances for a new kitchen, Pallrand says the necessary plumbing, mechanical, electrical, framing, and plaster takes up about one third of the project budget. Another third goes to finishes, and the final third goes to the installation of those finishes. In 2024, the average cost of new appliances has come down a bit from last year—but those figures are still up overall when compared to recent years. While many people blame traditional inflation, Pallrand says it’s not the cost of goods like appliances and countertops that are making princes increase; instead, it’s the labor costs that send remodeling budgets soaring. Hiring a general contractor, interior designer, or constructing crew has become increasingly costly.“Home renovation or construction is, and will always be, a labor-intensive business,” says Pallrand. “You can mass-produce some elements in advance, but they need to be put together on-site, and the cost of labor has increased significantly.”Below, we give an overview of where your money is likely to go in a kitchen renovation.How much does a small kitchen remodel cost?If you’re not feeling ready to totally gut your kitchen, you can still give it a facelift with a minor kitchen remodel. Tasks like updating to stainless steel, energy-efficient appliances, and painting your walls and cabinets can make a major difference. Dan Mazzarini, principal and creative director of AD PRO Directory firm BHDM Design and ARCHIVE, says that if you’re focused on keeping your budget in check, you can get a great-looking, less expensive range to suit almost any aesthetic these days. Ultimately, appliances should account for 10 to 20% of your budget at most for a mini kitchen remodel.“To save money, change cabinet hardware, not the kitchen cabinets, if you can,” Pallrand recommends. “If the cabinets are well made, paint them, and add some convenience hardware like pullouts, lifts, and organizers.”How much does a total kitchen remodel cost?For larger-scale renovations that are part of a major remodel, Mazzarini recommends focusing most of your project cost on custom cabinetry, countertops, and high-end appliances. “Really, these are the three main ‘food groups’ for a gorgeous kitchen,” he explains. “They are also the things that will sell a kitchen, so spend it here.”If you’re looking to install new cabinets and shelving, be prepared for it to consume between 20 and 40% of the budget. High-quality faucets and hardware are the “jewelry of the kitchen,” because they sparkle, shine, and get attention, so those features are likely to cost more if you’re using higher quality materials.HVAC and ducting work should take up about 5% of your budget, while plumbing fixtures should also come in at about 5%. Electrical work should account for approximately 10%, but “if electrical J-boxes are in the right place, change the light fixtures for an updated look,” suggests Pallrand.Is it possible to fully DIY my kitchen remodel?Disclaimer: You’d be hard pressed to find a kitchen professional who would recommend tackling a full kitchen remodel on your own! (We sure were.) “This gets tricky. Early in my career, I did my fair share of these kitchens,” says Mazzarini, who notes that, while sometimes they come out looking great, DIY remodels require patience and hard work. If you’re adamant about tackling some of the work yourself, consider taking on tasks that aren’t as heavy of a lift. “Painting and changing hardware is very different from installing new countertops yourself,” says Mazzarini. “My advice is to be safe, and call in the muscle for the heavy lifting—both figuratively and literally.”Should you always hire a pro?While plenty of people do attempt to DIY their kitchen remodel in order to keep costs low, our experts are in agreement on this one: Hire a professional for a full kitchen remodel. Pallrand cites examples of DIY mistakes, from paint colors not looking as expected to a faucet being improperly aligned to the sink. “There are so many things that can go wrong if you tackle it on your own and do not have any design or construction experience,” he cautions.Donna Garlough, author of Your Home, Your Style and owner of the Boston boutique Monroe Home \u0026 Style concurs, noting that “unless you’re a plumber, carpenter, or have a library of power tools, it’s easy to get in over your head and stuck without a working kitchen for an indefinite amount of time,” she says. “When in doubt, hire a pro.”Of course, there are certain DIY tasks that might be fun to tackle—but be patient with yourself. Garlough says cosmetic upgrades, like painting cabinetry and adding tile backsplash, might be a good place for handy people to start.What are the biggest challenges of a kitchen remodel?The way we live has changed significantly in the last few decades. The older the house, the more a kitchen’s layout needs to be reconsidered, says Pallrand. “Traditional kitchens, even those from a house as recent as the 1960s or ’70s, used the model of the kitchen as a utility space where food is made and served in another room,” Pallrand explains. “Nowadays, the kitchen is much more [of] a living room for entertaining or checking emails or doing homework.” Turning a kitchen into a public space can often involve expansion and reorientation to the rest of the house, and that’s a pricey endeavor. Plus, the older the house, the more the systems will need to be upgraded to today’s codes for safety. Luckily, updating the kitchen will have a positive effect on your home value, providing a return on investment you’re likely to recoup come selling time, no matter the size of the kitchen.What factors affect kitchen remodel cost?In a kitchen renovation—even one that may have started out very small-scale—“you’re kind of doing everything,” says Mazzarini. He describes kitchens as being like sweaters, as “sometimes, when you pull the strings, you end up in a much bigger project than you set out to accomplish.” Since kitchens involve appliances, plumbing fixtures, millwork, hard surfaces, and lighting, it’s one of the most technical rooms of a house. Combining utilities and lots of small details will affect the price tag of your kitchen overhaul. Another one of the most costly endeavors is upgrading the footprint by expanding the size of your kitchen or reorienting the layout. If you’re looking to reduce costs, Pallrand recommends spending money on better appliances that promise lasting durability and experience fewer problems. Another important factor to consider is where you live, per Mazzarini, since labor and access to materials depends on location.How can you save money on the remodel of a kitchen?Sticking with the existing layout is a great way to save money, says Garlough, who notes that a cosmetic upgrade is always going to be less expensive than a full remodel. From blowing out walls and adding more cabinetry, to moving electrical and plumbing, heavy changes will make your overall kitchen remodel cost go up.One surefire way to keep makeover costs down is by avoiding the latest trends, since it’s unlikely that you’ll want to undergo an invasive project like a kitchen renovation again in five years when you regret your style choices, per Garlough. “Check back in periodically to make sure you’re staying focused on what you originally wanted: things like upgraded appliances, a better work triangle, well-made cabinetry, smart storage, and the like,” says Garlough. “And if you find your budget skyrocketing, take care to prioritize those elements rather than the zellige tile, pot filler faucet, or handblown pendants you discovered halfway through the process.”To save on the cost of a kitchen remodel, Pallrand also recommends avoiding the latest trends, since a traditional kitchen will look appropriate in 10 or 100 years. “Sticking with what works will save on any remodel costs,” he says.",
