  "text": "lavender bushes depict van Gogh’s iconic painting in bosniaInspired by Vincent van Gogh’s iconic 1889 painting, Starry Night Retreat is a sanctuary in central Bosnia envisioned by entrepreneur Halim Zukić. At its heart is a 10-hectare park nestled within a natural amphitheater, a landscape in progress for over six years to bring art and nature into harmony. The park features swirling patterns and circular arrangements of over 130,000 lavender bushes in six vibrant hues, interwoven with aromatic and medicinal herbs such as sage, echinacea, wormwood, and chamomile. Fed by natural streams, 13 lakes, along with thousands of trees, enhance the multi-sensory ambiance of the park. Set to open in May 2025, Starry Night Retreat spans 70 hectares, offering an experience where the natural landscape becomes a living artwork.all images by Almin Tabak, unless stated otherwiseintuitive approach shapes landscape at Starry Night RetreatToday, 20 years after the beginning of its formation, Starry Night Retreat landscape design is a work in progress approaching its completion. Six years ago, Halim Zukić, standing on a hilltop, noticed the spiral patterns left by tractors in a hay meadow, evoking van Gogh’s swirling skies. Inspired by this vision, Zukić set out to shape the landscape with an amateur team, working without a specific project and formal design plans. Instead, following an intuitive, step-by-step approach, he used construction machinery as brushes and plants as his palette. Often reworking sections to achieve natural harmony, this process resulted in an undulating terrain free of straight lines, all while respecting the existing natural environment.inspired by Vincent van Gogh’s iconic 1889 painting, Starry Night Retreat is a retreat in central Bosniathe project aims to serve as open-air museumOver time, Zukić’s vision for Starry Night Retreat grew into a cultural sanctuary for reflection and creative expression. He envisions the retreat as an open-air museum, inviting artists from around the world to contribute to its evolving landscape. Beyond a tribute to van Gogh—and to those who follow their inner vision—the retreat will also serve as a cultural hub, hosting art programs and celebrating the heritage of the region.the landscape has been in progress for over six years to bring art and nature into harmonyover 130,000 lavender bushes in six vibrant hues shape swirling patterns and circular arrangementsaromatic and medicinal herbs such as sage, echinacea, wormwood, and chamomile complete the composition",
