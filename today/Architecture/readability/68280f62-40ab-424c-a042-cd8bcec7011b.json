  "text": "Mandy Moore is one of the thousands of residents displaced by the historically destructive Los Angeles wildfires. After her Altadena home was deemed “not livable” as a result of the Eaton blaze, Moore, her husband Taylor Goldsmith of the indie rock band Dawes, and their three children have moved into Hilary Duff’s Beverly Hills abode, per Moore’s brother-in-law Griffin Goldsmith.Griffin revealed in a recent Instagram post that Duff and her husband Matthew Koma opened their home to Moore’s family in their time of need. Duff and Koma also helped launch a GoFundMe campaign for Griffin’s own family since they, too, lost their home to the flames.“Our dear friends [Matthew Koma] and [Hilary Duff] thought it [was] wise to set up a gofundme for us to help with everything moving forward,” Griffin wrote. “Not to mention they are currently housing my brother’s family. They’ve taken care of my entire family from the moment this began. I will never be able to thank them adequately…This is the kindest act any human could do for another,” he added. “They are the most beautiful, selfless people we’ve ever known.”When the wildfires broke out last Wednesday, the This Is Us star shared on Instagram that her family evacuated the property “before it was too late.” Roughly a 40-minute drive away is Duff’s Beverly Hills home, a 5,260-square-foot Georgian–style sanctuary that the How I Met Your Father actor has lived in for nearly a decade.Moore and Duff’s friendship is over two decades in the making. In the early 2000s, the two kicked off their acting and singing careers around the same time, cementing themselves as beloved teen sensations through major Disney projects (Duff in Lizzie McGuire and Moore in The Princess Diaries). These days, the pair bond over parenthood.Join NowNew Year's Sale: Become an AD PRO member for only $20 $12 per monthArrowIn a December 2024 interview with People, Duff spoke highly of her celebrity mom friend group, which includes Moore, Meghan Trainor, and Ashley Tisdale. “I feel like our big connection to one another, even though we’re pop stars or on TV, is [that] we love our kids,” Duff told the outlet. “They were little baby worms when we all first got together and started music class at my house. Now, we’re in art class together, and we’re in gymnastics class together, and we’re just, like, moms.”",
