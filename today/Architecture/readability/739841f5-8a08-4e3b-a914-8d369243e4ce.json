  "text": "X+living crafts bookstore out of bricks and ironwork in chinaArchitectural design firm X+living unveils the Tianjin Zhongshuge bookstore in China, housing a three-story structure made out of bricks and ironwork. From the facade to the interior layout, every detail—down to the bookshelves—incorporates these two materials. Approximately 400,000 custom-designed bricks are used throughout the bookstore, each crafted to meet specific spatial and functional requirements. Bookshelves, seating areas, and steps become one with the structure, with trapezoidal brick shapes ensuring smooth transitions between different elements. Li Xiang, lead architect at X+living, uses a unique cutting technique to create gaps in the brickwork, allowing the building to breathe. Arched doorways rise in tiers like waves, reflecting the spread of knowledge, while the progressive steps within the bookstore metaphorically represent humanity’s pursuit of truth. As visitors ascend these steps, their journey through books becomes both a physical and spiritual ascent.‘The design aims to blur the physical boundaries of the architecture, suggesting that the boundaries of knowledge and cognition are vague, yet the spiritual core is clear and resolute. Just as the bookstore’s hybrid nature of commerce and culture dissolves the boundary between profit-oriented operations and public-spirited sharing. It appeals to an openness and accessibility to the public. The boundary does not represent rigidity; on the contrary, I believe it is filled with exploration and contention. While it proclaims a definition, it also leaves room for gaps, inviting conflict and challenge to occur.’  shares Li Xiang.all images courtesy of X+livingbricks in Tianjin Zhongshuge reinterpret classic architectureSurrounded by a century-old cluster of Italian red brick buildings, Tianjin Zhongshuge draws on the historical and cultural significance of the material, which is rooted in Italian and Chinese architectural traditions. In this project, Shanghai-based X+living uses red brick as a structural element and a symbol of craftsmanship, with each brick carved and stacked to reflect a sense of heritage. The use of these materials encourages a reflective pace, reminiscent of the slow, contemplative process of reading, inviting visitors to pause and engage with the space. Inspired by the structure of blinds, where light filters through slats to create interwoven patterns of light and shadow, the designer integrates this concept into the bookstore’s architecture. The dense brick walls are strategically cut, introducing gaps that lighten the material’s visual weight and create a dynamic interplay between solid and void, enhancing transparency and movement within the space. This cutting logic represents an innovative reinterpretation of classical architectural forms. The design also incorporates a deep blue steel plate that runs through the building’s core, and its undulating, wave-like form symbolizes the city’s maritime spirit, where rivers converge and knowledge flows.
