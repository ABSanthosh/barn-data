  "text": "Automotive company General Motors and developer Bedrock have released a proposal to redevelop the 1970s Renaissance Center complex in Detroit, which calls for the demolition of two of the skyscrapers on the site. The plans call for the removal of two of the skyscrapers and the redevelopment of the remaining three, all of which were originally designed by American architect John Portman and completed in the late 1970s on the city's riverfront. General Motors and Bedrock have released a conceptual proposal to redevelop the Renaissance Center skyscrapers in DetroitAccording to the developers, two of the office towers closest to the rivers will be removed. Michigan's tallest tower, the Detroit Marriott, which stands 727 feet tall (222 meters) and the two other large skyscrapers will be kept and renovated, transforming the complex into one geared more towards residential and hospitality use. A low-rise base that connects the buildings will also be removed to orient the structure towards the redevelopment of the riverfront included in the plans. Public space as well as a promenade to create more connections with the city are also included in the development plans. \"This iconic landmark's future is important to Detroit and Michigan, and our shared vision with General Motors ensures that its redevelopment aligns with Detroit's economic advancement,\" said Bedrock CEO Kofi Bonner. \"Additionally, our collaborative approach makes certain that the reimagined Renaissance Center and the riverfront further augment and support the city's continued growth, benefiting the community and region at large.\" The scheme would see the demolition of two of the five John Portman-designed skyscrapersRenderings of the redevelopment show the central Detroit Marriot building prominently standing next to the river, whereas before it sat in the middle of the four taller skyscrapers, slightly obscured. At its base will be a more condensed glass podium that extends towards the river. East of the complex, a series of low-lying structures and landscaped areas will replace what is now a massive parking lot. Since the complex was purchased by General Motors (GM) in 1998, it has undergone multiple renovations and improvements, but Bedrock said the skyscrapers need to be updated to suit present demand in a time when office real estate is still uncertain. \"When GM purchased the building in 1996, it was a catalyst for the revitalization of downtown Detroit and development of the Riverwalk,\" said Bedrock. \"To date, GM has invested more than $1 billion in improvements to the RenCen site, however, it must be reinvented to be viable into the future.\" Bedrock said that it and GM have both pledged the \"majority\" of funds for the redevelopment, but that it will look to public funds to finance the remainder. This will require approval by local legislatures and regulators. It includes the placement of a riverfront parkGM told the Detroit Free Press that demolishing the whole complex is possible if the firms cannot secure enough funding to carry out the redevelopment. GM had no comment on its statement to the Detroit Free Press when approached by Dezeen. Renderings supplied to Dezeen of the redevelopment were credited to Gensler and Field Operations, though a spokesperson for GM said that it was \"far too early to speculate on the final plans\". Bedrock has redeveloped a number of other structures in the city including the 1920s Book Tower skyscraper, which was turned into a hospitality venue last year by Method Co.
