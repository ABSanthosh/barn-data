Start your entry today, and take advantage of the Early Entry prices! When the AI wave first crashed into architecture, many feared the end was near. Digital tools like Midjourney, DALL-E and Stable Diffusion could sketch, render and visualize ideas faster than most human teams. Overnight, centuries of craft risked being reduced to a series of prompts and algorithms. But not everyone panicked. Some adapted and evolved. A few, like Amir Hossein Noori, were already living in the future and gaining recognition for it. In 2023, Noori earned Special Mentions at the Architizer Vision Awards, both in the Architect Creator of the Year category and for his AI-assisted visualization project, Cave of Wonders. His early work showed that architects could engage with AI critically and creatively, instead of defensively. He is part of a new generation of architects paving the way forward for a future of architecture with AI. Project by AHN Studio | Images courtesy of Amir Hossein Noori Rather than treating AI as a threat, Noori embraced it as a design partner. As the Cofounder and CEO of AI Hub, he has built a system that helps architects and designers survive in a creative industry that is changing faster than anyone expected. Through AI Hub, Noori has been quietly reshaping what an architect’s toolkit looks like. Instead of offering off-the shelf solutions, his team builds custom AI tools tailored to each firm’s needs. They train design teams to find and use the right technologies, create private AI models to protect creative identity and help architects win more projects, save time, and work smarter. The early days of AI’s arrival were chaotic. Many architects worried that machine-generated design would dilute the craft or even eliminate the need for human designers altogether. I for one, was worried about the fact that it further encouraged the wrong notion that everything done quickly was good, even if it really wasn’t. For Noori,  the panic missed because he was way ahead of time. Architects, he believed, could either resist it or lead it. Project by AHN Studio | Images courtesy of Amir Hossein Noori “My design process is a combination of manual and hand drawing, software, and artificial intelligence. In the initial phase of the project, the project brief is established through multiple client discussions,” says Amir Hossein Noori. “Using the brief and developing a narrative that can support the project’s design concepts, the procedure continues. After refining the narrative, I begin to visualize the ideas using sloppy sketches and diagrams, which are then translated into powerful visuals using artificial intelligence and other software.” Just like Noori, survival for architects should not be about working harder or faster. It should be about working differently. Architects who once spent days refining 3D models now collaborate with AI systems that generate dozens of options in hours. Those who once viewed design as a linear, painstaking process now see it as an agile, evolving conversation between human intention and machine intelligence. The shift has not been easy. Many traditional architects resist the idea of AI participating in the sacred creative process. But some architects are not clinging to the standard definitions of authorship. They are reframing their role and are moving from sole creators to creative directors. They guide and collaborate with AI. Their tools simply changed but the vision is still theirs. Project by AHN Studio | Images courtesy of Amir Hossein Noori Noori’s work shows that AI is not here to replace architects; it is here to extend them. By the work he has done with AI hub, he is showing that the future of architecture belongs to those who know how to lead both people and machines. Its not about losing control. It is about changing the reins and spending less time on the mundane tasks that bog down creativity and more time on the things that matter. Architecture education, too, will need to evolve. As AI becomes a standard design tool, future architects will need to be fluent in form-making, prompt engineering, data interpretation, and creative collaboration with non-human systems. Being a great designer will no longer mean just drawing faster. It will mean thinking broader. Project by AHN Studio | Images courtesy of Amir Hossein Noori At its core, architecture has always been a negotiation between art and technology. From the invention of squares and tables to the first CAD programs, technology has pushed the boundaries of design. AI is simply the next tool in that continuum. Like every tool before it, it demands adaptation and leadership, not fear. The architects who resisted AI may still be standing for now. But those who have embraced it, like Amir Hossein Noori, are already building the next generation of practice. And they are making it clear that in the next era of architecture, vision is still the most powerful tool. Architizer’s Vision Awards are back!
