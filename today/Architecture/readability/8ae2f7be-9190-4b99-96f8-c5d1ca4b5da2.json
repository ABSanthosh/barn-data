  "text": "simple design archive: a poetic sanctuary in the cityThe newly completed gallery Simple Design Archive, by architecture studio HAS Design and Research, is a new addition to Hefei, China. This multi-purpose museum houses contemporary Asian art and modern Northern European furniture, blending art and architecture to create an immersive visitor experience. The team, led by architects Jenchieh Hung and Kulthida Songkittipakdee, was inspired by the surrounding natural beauty of Anhui’s famous Huangshan Mountain, aiming to create a serene, flowing space that mirrors the region’s timeless, poetic landscape.Breaking from conventional museum design, the Simple Design Archive’s entrance does not directly connect to the bustling exterior. Instead, visitors pass through a sequence of nearly ten curved walls, designed to resemble natural rock formations or ‘caves.’ These walls form a barrier that shields the museum from the noise of the city, while creating an inner courtyard referred to as an ‘echo chamber.’ The varied heights of the wall openings control the flow of light and sound, turning the courtyard into a peaceful acoustic refuge.images © W WorkspaceA Natural Micro-Ecosystem within hefei, chinaThe architects at HAS Design and Research introduce Simple Design Archive’s ‘echo chamber’ courtyard to create both a physical buffer and a small ecosystem — the space draws in birds, cicadas, and other wildlife. The landscaping introduces natural sounds into the space, enriching the auditory experience of visitors. As the day progresses, the curved walls also filter light, blocking the intense western sun and creating patterns of light and shade. In the afternoons, this interplay of sunlight and shadow transforms the courtyard into a space reminiscent of a church, offering moments of reflection and spiritual calm to urban dwellers.The design philosophy extends beyond the entrance. Inside the museum, the curving walls of the exterior continue into the gallery spaces, creating a fluid transition between the outside and inside. This continuity reinforces the feeling of natural flow that the architects sought to evoke. Upon entering the foyer, visitors are guided toward a curving gallery, where the high walls open to a seasonal garden illuminated by a five-meter-high skylight. The interplay of light and shadows changes throughout the day, creating a dynamic environment that mirrors the cyclical rhythms of nature.Simple Design Archive is a gallery in Hefei, China designed by HAS Design and Researcharchitecture as a Multi-Functional ToolBeyond the gallery, Simple Design Archive’s art and materials library features continuous walls formed by HAS Design and Research. These walls, unbroken and flowing, display art collections and handcrafted furniture, creating an uninterrupted visual experience. This deliberate design choice ensures that visitors can engage with the exhibits at their own pace, in a setting that feels calm.The use of continuous walls throughout the Simple Design Archive is a key architectural strategy. These walls are not merely structural elements but are used to guide visitors, display artwork, and store objects. By doing so, HAS Design and Research not only defines the boundaries of the space but also integrates these boundaries into the museum’s overall experience.
