Led by Homme Architects and commissioned by Xiangban Cultural Tourism, the project sits backdropped by the mountains, shifting Pengzhou’s traditional vegetable trading center toward an inclusive, community experience.The building’s structural design combines steel and wood in a lightweight frame supporting a blue-tiled roof in a contemporary reinterpretation of Sichuan’s traditional beam-framed architecture. A round portal carves into the roof, welcoming views of the bamboo forest in the center and the vast fields beyond. Expansive glazing along the facades strengthens the architecture’s relationship with its outdoors, creating an immersive interaction between nature, sustainable design, and regional architecture.all images by Yi Liexpo garden’s architecture draws on the site’s geographyThe site’s distinct geography and cultural heritage informs the Tianfu Vegetable Fragrance Expo Garden’s design.
