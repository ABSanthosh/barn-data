  "text": "Air House’s design emphasizes air, light, space, and viewsESTUDIO 87’s design of Air House prioritizes spatial quality over quantitative elements, focusing on air, light, space, and views rather than rigid programmatic distribution. The house in Buenos Aires, Argentina, interacts subtly with an existing structure, establishing a connection through open voids and highlighting contrasts.The concept of air, with its undefined volume, transparency, and sensitivity to temperature, guided the architectural approach. The design emphasizes the relationship between the interior and exterior, allowing air to flow through the house and enable cross-ventilation. Instead of fixed walls, furniture is used to define interior boundaries, providing flexibility that can adapt to the changing needs of the occupants. A courtyard acts as the central link between public and private spaces. The house does not have a single main entrance but features multiple access points connected by a semi-covered gallery. Clear sightlines extend from these entryways, framed by oak wood, which defines the boundary with neighboring properties.all images by Albano GarcíaESTUDIO 87 employs iron, concrete, glass, and woodThe structure is defined by two horizontal planes supported by 12 metal columns and enclosed with floor-to-ceiling windows. The architectural team at ESTUDIO 87 incorporates an overhang and metal sunshades to filter sunlight, creating rhythmic patterns on the facade. An accessible green roof replaces the absorbent ground previously occupied, contributing to the house’s sustainable features.The material palette includes iron, concrete, and glass, with wood used in a subtle manner. At night, indirect perimeter lighting and home automation systems regulate artificial light, enhancing spatial comfort. The interplay of natural and artificial lighting creates fluid and open spaces that dissolve boundaries, reinforcing the house’s connection to its surroundings.Air House by ESTUDIO 87 prioritizes air, light, space, and views over rigid programmatic layoutsthe house emphasizes a fluid relationship between interior and exterior spacesthe design integrates with an existing structure through open voidscross-ventilation is enabled by the open design, allowing air to circulate naturally through the house",
