  "text": "May 16, 2025 Situated on a street of older houses, the Shudell House, designed by Weiss Architecture + Urbanism, is a prime example of when brick is used in a contemporary way. The Toronto neighborhood, known locally as “The Pocket”, where this home is located, has deep roots in brick. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the area was lined with quarries and brickworks. Many of the nearby homes were built by master masons who took pride in details that often went unnoticed by passersby. This new house continues that lineage in a quiet but powerful way. The brickwork is a deliberate tribute to the area’s heritage. The diamond patterning, known as “diapering,” was once a hallmark of skilled masonry in cities with strong brickmaking traditions. This home updates that tradition, using a mix of buff and dark brown brick to create a layered texture that feels both historic and contemporary.
