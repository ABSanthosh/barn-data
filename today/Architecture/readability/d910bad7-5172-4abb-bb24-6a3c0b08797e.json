  "text": "Mariah Carey may want to hold onto her Queen of Christmas crown a little tighter. On a recent episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show, the “Since U Been Gone” singer revealed that she has an entire “Christmas room” in her New York City home that stays decorated year-round.Clarkson, who took her talk show with her when she moved from Los Angeles to Manhattan in 2023, explained during a recent interview with Here actor Robin Wright that her new pad near Central Park has more space than she knows what to do with. One room in particular had the mom of two stumped.“I decorated it the first year for Christmas. And then I was like, ‘That was a lot of work. We’ll just shut the doors until [next] Christmas,’” Clarkson told Wright with a laugh. The Grammy winner doesn’t let all that holiday cheer go to waste, though: “We literally will go in there and dance throughout the year and just put Christmas songs on,” she said, referencing impromptu holiday jam sessions with her eight- and 10-year-old kids.Outside of her dedicated room, it seems the “Underneath the Tree” singer is already in the full Christmas swing for this year. “For me, November first is the marker,” she reasoned with the Forrest Gump star, “Because you spend so much time decorating.” That sentiment is shared by Carey, who for the past five years has released increasingly elaborate videos on November first to ring in the yuletide season, announcing that “it’s tiiiiiiiiime.” Of course, Clarkson gives credit where credit is due: “When Mariah came out with her first Christmas record, she changed the game for all of us,” Clarkson said in a recent statement to the New York Times.The American Idol winner, who recently dropped a deluxe version of one of her two Christmas albums, plus a new remix feature on Cher’s “DJ Play a Christmas Song,” will return for the second year in a row to host NBC’s Rockefeller Center tree-lighting ceremony on December 4.Register TodayAD PRO's 2025 Interior Design Forecast is almost hereArrowAs for Carey, she recently embarked on her Christmas Time tour, which will conclude in New York on December 17. She’s also celebrating the 30th anniversary of “Merry Christmas,” the album that established her as the Queen of Christmas in the first place. “It’s something that I look forward to all year,” Carey told NYT of her feelings around the holiday. “Maybe people think it’s something that I put on, but it’s really my favorite time of year.”",
