  "text": "The iconic Eames House, Getty Villa, and other Los Angeles landmarks are at risk of destruction following a series of brush fires that have ravaged Southern California since Tuesday. As of publication time, two casualties have been reported and evacuation order were put in place for nearly 30,000 residents. California governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency and warned that the blaze could continue for days. “By no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods,” he said.The fire started around 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles. Two other fires, named the Eaton fire and Hurst fire, ignited later in the day, impacting Altadena and Sylmar, respectively. The cause of all three is still under investigation, but according to officials, more than 1,000 homes, business, and buildings have been destroyed, and around 13,000 structures across the Los Angeles area are at risk.Homes in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles Photo: David Swanson/Getty Images“The fire is being fueled by a combination of strong Santa Ana wind and surrounding topography, which makes it extremely challenging for us firefighters to get a handle on it because we dealt with wind gusts up to 100 miles per hour last night,” Erik Scott, a firefighter and the Public Information Officer for the Los Angeles Fire Department, said in a video posted on X. “Our priority is life and structure defense.” As Scott detailed, protecting life is the most important, while structural integrity is also paramount. Below, the current status of a number of local landmarks.What buildings have been affected by the Palisades fires?The Getty Villa: Katherine E. Fleming, president and CEO of the J Paul Getty Trust, confirmed in a statement on Tuesday evening that the fire had reached the museum’s grounds, but that staff and collections remained safe. “Museum galleries and library archives were sealed off from smoke by state-of-the-art air-handling systems. The double-walled construction of galleries also provides significant protection for the collections,” Fleming said.Villa de Leon, also known as the Kauffman Estate, seen amid flames.

The estate was seen engulfed in flames on a video posted on Instagram by Los Angeles Magazine.Palisades Charter High School: The New York Times confirmed that classrooms, tennis courts, the baseball field, and bungalows had all burned in the fire. The school was closed for winter break, and only a small number of people had to be evacuated, according to the BBC. The local high school is known for a number of celebrity and entertainment industry alumni including J.J. Abrams, Forest Whitaker, and Will.i.am.Palisades Elementary Charter School: Nearby, the Palisades Elementary Charter School had also reportedly been burned, according to the BBC and Los Angeles Scanner, an X account reporting real-time news across the LA area.The Eames House in California Photo: Walter Bibikow/Getty ImagesEames House: A landmark of 20th century design, the colorful modernist house was designed by Charles and Ray Eames in 1949 and served as their home and studio until their death. Though located in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, which has been heavily affected by the fire, the home is currently unharmed. “We are closely monitoring the situation, and the Eames Foundation has taken every precaution to protect the site. Yesterday, the foundation’s team worked quickly to remove a small number of objects from the house before they had to evacuate the building,” Lucia Dewey Atwood, executive director of the Eames Foundation, said in a statement to AD. “The loss and displacement caused by these fires is staggering, and we stand in solidarity with everyone affected during this incredibly difficult time.” Visits to the residence are cancelled until further notice.Theatre Palisades, Pierson Playhouse: Founded by three veteran television writers, Theatre Palisade, Pierson Playhouse was located in a California Modern structure designed by John G. Wallis. “Our beloved Pierson Playhouse is gone, but the heart of Theatre Palisades beats on. We will rise again,” the organization posted on Facebook.The Pasadena Jewish Temple and Center was lost early Wednesday.

According to a post on Facebook, the red shiplap building that housed the store was lost in the fire. “This is so unreal for me, and I’m having a hard time finding the words that even make sense. I want to thank everyone who has sent kind words and expressed concern for the store, my family, and staff. We are so thankful for the love and support you all have shown us after 60 years in business,” the owners wrote.Reel Inn: A iconic roadside seafood restaurant, Reel Inn succumbed to flames, according to The Malibu Times. “Known for its fresh fish and laid-back coastal atmosphere, Reel Inn has been a staple along the Pacific Coast Highway for decades,” the outlet wrote.This is a developing story.",
