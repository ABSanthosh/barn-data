However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.In the days since devastating fires began sweeping through Los Angeles, vast swaths of neighborhoods like Altadena and the Pacific Palisades are likely all but lost. Dozens of people have died; more than 12,000 structures have been destroyed. As of Monday, January 13, many of the fires are still raging, and 150,000 residents have been forced to evacuate.“I’m almost certain the apocalypse in LA right now will be one of the worst things I see or experience in my life,” wrote AD100 designer Mark D. Sikes in an Instagram post. Calling the catastrophe “a complete tragedy,” Sikes noted, thankfully, that his own home near the Hollywood Hills was spared. “Our team is safe.”Sadly, not all were so lucky. Word of the impact on the city’s vibrant architecture and design communities came quickly and mostly online. On Wednesday, designer Suzanne Tucker posted a photo of a client’s house in ruins. “I finished [it] a few months ago,” she wrote. “They are safe. The house is completely gone. And there will be thousands of photos like this of unfathomable loss and utter heartbreak.” She was right: Over the course of the next day, numerous designers, including Leanne Ford, shared their own tragedies. “Three weeks ago we got keys to our new LA place in Rustic Canyon. It was a place to write, to create. Three days ago we lost it,” Ford wrote. “We are the lucky ones. Still, to be affected by fires is shocking. I’ve been praying hard for ‘the peace that passes understanding’ through this—for everyone.”While the conflagrations are unprecedented, they are not unimaginable in an area plagued by recurring wildfires. Last week, the design writer Gregory Han and his wife went through their 1963 Altadena foothills home inch by inch, preparing for the worst. (Han even wrote a Wirecutter article on protecting homes in high-risk zones, publishing it the day the fires arrived.) But little can stop 100 mile-per-hour winds. “Our home is currently in a Schrödinger’s state, with firefighters still on the adjacent hillside hardening the [land] and dropping water to keep our neighborhood from adding to the toll,” he wrote to me on Friday. “For now the house is still standing. Not knowing has been a very challenging part of the situation, all the while learning this friend or that acquaintance has lost their home. There’s an element of survivor’s guilt and gratitude battling incessantly.”As Han and thousands more wait and see, the tally of confirmed losses increases. Dozens of historic landmarks are gone, including Altadena’s Bunny Museum, the Brutalist Robert Bridges House above Sunset Boulevard in the Palisades, and William Randolph Hearst’s Topanga Ranch Motel. Some are still in danger, including Case Study House #8 (the Eames House), and are being closely monitored.Retail shops have not been spared: Amber Lewis posted that her Shoppe Amber Interiors store in the Palisades is gone. “Our company values are deeply rooted in our love and appreciation for all things ‘home’ and we are absolutely devastated for all those who have lost theirs,” she posted. JJ Martin’s forthcoming DoubleJ store was also destroyed. “This was doublej’s very first shop in the United States, a labor of love, enthusiasm and total joy, conceived and painstakingly designed by our team over the last 9 months. We are unfathomably heartbroken,” she wrote on Instagram. “It has been excruciating watching the homes on Enchanted Way where I grew up burn to the ground, including our childhood home, the Gundershaugs down the street, seeing videos of family friends driving through walls of flame.”Some stores, like Riverside Drive’s Salvare Goods and Coco’s Variety, have recast themselves as distribution centers providing free wares to residents in need. Clad Home and many other showrooms are functioning as donation drop-off locations, while Heath Ceramics posted that “all are welcome” in their LA showroom for “water and light snacks, power to charge your phone, restrooms, a place to take a moment while we all figure out what’s next.” Nursery outfitter Babyletto has offered replacement cribs for anyone who lost their home too: After just 24 hours, says founder Teddy Fong, they began “processing over 400 inquiries from families in need.” That number speaks to the scope of the ongoing tragedy—and also the design community’s immediate response.Workplaces, too, are lending a hand to neighbors. AD PRO Directory member RIOS has opened its office doors to support victims from the design community, offering space to work, access the web, and find comfort. Also underway: a rebuilding guide containing updates from the city, county, and state. (For more information or to access the guide, email etosha@rios.com.)The Los Angeles Conservancy has posted a Fire Impact Form on their website to offer assistance, and architect Joanna Grant compiled a Google sheet for architects, engineers, and contractors to help with rebuilding. (Fill out the form here if you want to add your name.) And interior design consulting platform The Expert has launched a Rebuild Hotline, offering free one-hour calls to those who have lost their homes.While it may feel too soon to start thinking about rebuilding, this cataclysmic event is a stark reminder of the effects of a changing climate and extreme weather. And meanwhile, there’s no time like the present to support those most in need with donations to GoFundMe campaigns (AD writer Rachel Davies is tracking them here, and a list of fundraisers for displaced Black families can be found here.) AD has also shared resources on its Instagram for making an impact, like the World Central Kitchen, the California Community Foundation, and the California Fire Foundation.As designer Michael Hilal posted on Saturday, “The next years are going to be filled with hard choices and anxiety as everyone pushes through. It’s more important than ever that we reach out and give a helping hand to everyone who is suffering to help soften the blow as much as possible.”",
