It’s hard to know where he really stands. — LA Times Candidate Trump had stated his ambition to open federal lands for housing development among his only tangible plans that could directly elicit the production of new housing. The threat of new tariff impositions/reforms, which has been wielded aggressively against U.S. trade partners in Mexico, Canada, and China, is seen as likely kneecapping the overburdened supply chain for building products and materials and therefore counterproductive for home builders. Building costs would likely be negatively affected by the administration's threatened mass deportations as well.  The country's current housing shortage stands at over 4 million homes, according to the National Association of Realtors and other industry groups.",
