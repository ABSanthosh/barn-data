  "text": "Interior Define Sloan 2-Seat Reversible Chaise SectionalReviewer: Malia GriggsModel tested (with shop link): Interior Define Sloan 2-Seat Reversible Chaise SectionalThe details: Interior Define goes deeper into customization than most retailers do. Plenty of brands let you pick a fabric or adjust the size, but with ID’s seating, you can tweak nearly every detail—from seat depth and cushion fill to leg style, sectional length, and what highly specific shade of green you want. It’s a more detailed, flexible process than what you’ll find at most online furniture brands. The Sloan sectional sofa is a great example: It has a clean, midcentury-inspired silhouette and a range of configurations, including a reversible chaise, multiple widths, and a ton of fabric options.Ordering processPrice: How much does it cost? Are there payment plans available?Including customizations, taxes, and a $279 flat-rate fee for in-home delivery and assembly, the total price came to $3,576. The base price for my configuration of the Sloan sectional, a three-seater with a chaise, $3,140. I chose a performance velvet fabric, oiled walnut legs, the standard 36-inch seat depth (it’s $300 extra for a deeper seat), a 63-inch chaise (the longer of two options), and an 87-inch overall length. I stuck with the standard down-alternative fill—the down blend would’ve added another $300.You can split payments into four increments every two weeks through Afterpay if your order is under $4,000, but approval depends on your credit, and there are late fees if you miss a payment.What are the upholstery or customization options? Did you choose any?There are a lot of ways you can fine-tune the details on the Sloan. You can choose from over 100 colors in a range of fabrics—performance velvets, brushed knits, linens, chenilles, bouclés, tweeds, plush, and more—and 18 leg finishes in a mix of woods and metals. I opted for Essex, an earthy green performance velvet, and rounded oiled walnut legs, which work well with the darker wood and jewel tones in my living room.The Sloan comes in two seat depths: a standard 36-inch and an extra-deep 40-inch version. You can also choose from a 63-inch or 73-inch long chaise , and adjust the chaise width to either the standard 35 or 45 inches. I went with the standard depth and shorter chaise.For the overall sofa width, there are six size options ranging from 75 to 91 inches; I went with the 87-inch, which was just right for my space. To be sure everything would fit, I brought home the offered free fabric swatches and mapped out the full layout with painter’s tape—a step I highly recommend.What is the lead time for customization, manufacturing, and delivery?Because ID’s furniture is mostly made-to-order, it does take a while longer to receive its pieces. The company quotes an 8- to 12-week lead time for most of its customizable pieces, and mine arrived right around the 12-week mark. The company notes that delivery timelines vary by collection and are listed on the product page, in your cart, and in the confirmation email for ultimate transparency. I didn’t receive many updates during the building process, but I was notified when the couch was ready to ship, and when I was prompted to schedule a delivery window.Couch delivery + assemblyWhat was the delivery process like?Once my couch was ready, I received a scheduling email from Interior Define’s delivery partner, Metropolitan Shipping. The team arrived promptly within the three-hour morning window, and I appreciated that the entire process was easy to coordinate.Interior Define charges a flat-rate delivery fee between $99 and $279, depending on the size of the order. For made-to-order items like mine, the $279 fee includes white glove service; the delivery team brings the piece into your home, handles setup, and cleans up, taking all of the packaging with them.What was the assembly process like? How long did it take, and how many people?Two delivery people handled the full setup in under 20 minutes—impressive, considering their delivery truck was blocking traffic on the narrow road outside my apartment building. Assembly was minimal; the legs needed to be screwed on and the chaise position decided, but otherwise, the pieces arrived intact and without much setup needed. Once everything was in place, the workers cleared out all the packaging and left the space clean and ready to go.After installationWhat are the dimensions? How does it fit in your space? Would it be better suited for a different type of home?My couch measures 87 inches long, with a 63-inch chaise and a 36-inch seat depth. I debated going with the extra-deep 40-inch version, which I probably would have loved for lounging, but it would’ve pushed the chaise even further into the entryway. The 36-inch depth ended up being the right call. For reference, I’m five four, and the width of the sofa is enough for me to lie across without feeling cramped.The Sloan fits my living room so perfectly, several friends have commented that it looks like it was custom-made for the space (which it was!). My living room borders a narrow entry hall, and I worried the chaise might jut out too far and turn into a tripping hazard. But all the careful measuring (and light agonizing) paid off; the Sloan doesn’t block any walkways, and it visually harmonizes with the décor of the room.A nice feature: The Sloan’s chaise is reversible, so you can switch it from left to right depending on your layout. While it’s not fully modular, it does offer some flexibility—reconfiguring the chaise takes a few steps (disconnecting the clips underneath and possibly reinstalling the legs), but it’s manageable and a great option if I move or rearrange my space.The Sloan works neatly as a sectional for a small space in my roughly 196-square-foot living room, but it could easily suit a more open layout if you scaled up the frame.Sit test: Is it comfortable? Does it feel well made? Does the couch have a tendency to sag?The Sloan feels well-constructed and balanced. It’s not one of those ultra-cushy, sink-in couches, but I didn’t want that. I prefer furniture (mattresses included) that lean firmer and maintain their shape over time. That said, the sectional is not stiff or unforgiving by any means. The cushions have softened slightly with regular use, and the seat has just enough give to make it comfortable without feeling floppy. The chaise is wide and supportive enough to curl up without sliding around.Lay test: Is it comfortable? Does it feel well-made? Does the couch have a tendency to sag?Definitely. I’ve stretched out on the chaise for movies, taken plenty of naps, and even spent the night on the main seat when my parents stayed in my bedroom. The cushions have held their shape well—no sagging or uneven spots. With the back cushions removed, the sofa doubles as a surprisingly roomy single bed for my height. While the standard down-alternative fill isn’t super plush, it’s plenty supportive. Worth noting: Interior Define does offer an even plusher down blend for an extra $300.Is the sectional suitable for particular decor styles and, if so, which?The Sloan’s clean lines, softly rounded edges, and simple silhouette make it stylistically versatile—it works well with my mix of midcentury and Japandi influences, but it could easily suit more traditional or contemporary spaces depending on your fabric and leg choices. The deep green velvet and walnut leg I chose add richness and warmth without feeling overly formal or staunchly modern.Is it durable/practical in a modern home? Is the couch kid- and/or dog-friendly?I have two cats, and the sectional has held up surprisingly well against their havoc—wrestling on the chaise, treating its sides like a scratching post, and near-constant shedding. While I wouldn’t call velvet a low-maintenance upholstery choice (it definitely attracts lint and pet hair), it has performed better than I expected. My last couch was chenille, and whenever my pets scratched it, the threads would start to pull and get stringy. That hasn’t happened here. Velvet has a short, dense pile that doesn’t snag the same way—so even when my cats do go to town with their claws, the fabric doesn’t show damage as obviously. I also specifically chose performance velvet, which has a more durable, tightly woven surface than some of the brand’s other options, like the brushed vintage velvet, which is finer and more delicate. (Feeling a sturdier leather sofa instead? Try Interior Define’s Gaby Leather 3-Seat Chaise Sectional.)What are the care and cleaning instructions? Do you think stains could be easily removed?I’ve accepted that daily care is—sigh—part of owning a velvet couch with pets. Or it is for me, anyway, because I want to keep my prized couch looking pristine. I hung a reusable lint roller on the wall next to the sofa and swipe it across the fabric every day—especially on the chaise, which is the cats’ preferred lounging spot. I’ve also draped a washable throw blanket along the seat to help keep fur under control.For scratches, I use a soft-bristled brush to blend out marks and spray the sides with a fabric-safe deterrent to discourage clawing. So far, both seem to have helped prevent lasting damage.My nightmare scenario did happen: One of the cats threw up a hairball directly on the velvet. I gently scraped up what I could, pressed at the stain, then treated it with an enzymatic stain-and-odor spray. After letting it sit and smoothing it out, there was no visible trace left behind. A miracle!Do the photos do this product justice? Was there anything you were surprised to see IRL?For the most part, yes, but the green velvet looks noticeably different in person. Online, it appears darker and flatter; in my apartment, it has far more depth and pop, especially as the light shifts throughout the day (and as it reacts to the warm yellow of my lamps). I was extremely glad I took home the free fabric swatches before committing.I’d expected the couch to feel bulkier, given the chaise. But the scale feels spot-on; the sectional balances out the living room without weighing it down. I love how seamlessly the Sloan fits into the rest of my apartment—and how glamorous it looks from every angle.Sectional grades (from A to F)Comfort: AValue: ADelivery and assembly: A+Style: A+Overall couch rating: A (only not an A+ because it is admittedly expensive)I really do love this couch. If you enjoy tailoring your décor to your taste, are willing to pay a bit more for quality, and have the patience for a made-to-order process, this is a wonderful sectional—especially for a smaller space (and even with cats).",

deeper into customization than most retailers do. Plenty of brands let you pick a fabric or adjust the size, but with ID’s seating, you can tweak nearly every detail—from seat depth and cushion fill to leg style, sectional length, and what \u003cem\u003ehighly specific\u003c/em\u003e shade of green you want.

The Sloan \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-sectional-sofas\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esectional sofa\u003c/a\u003e is a great example: It has a clean, midcentury-inspired silhouette and a range of configurations, including a reversible chaise, multiple widths, and a ton of fabric options.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"ordering-process\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eOrdering process\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"price-how-much-does-it-cost-are-there-payment-plans-available\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrice: How much does it cost? Are there payment plans available?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIncluding customizations, taxes, and a $279 flat-rate fee for in-home delivery and assembly, the total price came to $3,576. The base price for my configuration of the Sloan sectional, a three-seater with a chaise, $3,140. I chose a performance velvet fabric, oiled walnut legs, the standard 36-inch seat depth (it’s $300 extra for a deeper seat), a 63-inch chaise (the longer of two options), and an 87-inch overall length. I stuck with the standard down-alternative fill—the down blend would’ve added another $300.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can split payments into four increments every two weeks through Afterpay if your order is under $4,000, but approval depends on your credit, and there are late fees if you miss a payment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"what-are-the-upholstery-or-customization-options-did-you-choose-any\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat are the upholstery or customization options? Did you choose any?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of ways you can fine-tune the details on the Sloan. You can choose from over 100 colors in a range of fabrics—performance velvets, brushed knits, linens, chenilles, bouclés, tweeds, plush, and more—and 18 leg finishes in a mix of woods and metals. I opted for Essex, an earthy green performance velvet, and rounded oiled walnut legs, which work well with the darker wood and jewel tones in my living room.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Sloan comes in two seat depths: a standard 36-inch and an extra-deep 40-inch version. You can also choose from a 63-inch or 73-inch long chaise , and adjust the chaise width to either the standard 35 or 45 inches. I went with the standard depth and shorter chaise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the overall sofa width, there are six size options ranging from 75 to 91 inches; I went with the 87-inch, which was just right for my space. To be sure everything would fit, I brought home the offered free fabric swatches and mapped out the full layout with painter’s tape—a step I highly recommend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"what-is-the-lead-time-for-customization-manufacturing-and-delivery\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat is the lead time for customization, manufacturing, and delivery?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause ID’s furniture is mostly made-to-order, it does take a while longer to receive its pieces. The company quotes an 8- to 12-week lead time for most of its customizable pieces, and mine arrived right around the 12-week mark. The company notes that delivery timelines vary by collection and are listed on the product page, in your cart, and in the confirmation email for ultimate transparency. I didn’t receive many updates during the building process, but I was notified when the couch was ready to ship, and when I was prompted to schedule a delivery window.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"couch-delivery-assembly\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCouch delivery + assembly\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"what-was-the-delivery-process-like\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat was the delivery process like?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce my couch was ready, I received a scheduling email from Interior Define’s delivery partner, Metropolitan Shipping. The team arrived promptly within the three-hour morning window, and I appreciated that the entire process was easy to coordinate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterior Define charges a flat-rate delivery fee between $99 and $279, depending on the size of the order. For made-to-order items like mine, the $279 fee includes white glove service; the delivery team brings the piece into your home, handles setup, and cleans up, taking all of the packaging with them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"what-was-the-assembly-process-like-how-long-did-it-take-and-how-many-people\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat was the assembly process like? How long did it take, and how many people?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwo delivery people handled the full setup in under 20 minutes—impressive, considering their delivery truck was blocking traffic on the narrow road outside my apartment building. Assembly was minimal; the legs needed to be screwed on and the chaise position decided, but otherwise, the pieces arrived intact and without much setup needed. Once everything was in place, the workers cleared out all the packaging and left the space clean and ready to go.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"after-installation\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAfter installation\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"what-are-the-dimensions-how-does-it-fit-in-your-space-would-it-be-better-suited-for-a-different-type-of-home\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat are the dimensions? How does it fit in your space? Would it be better suited for a different type of home?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy couch measures 87 inches long, with a 63-inch chaise and a 36-inch seat depth. I debated going with the extra-deep 40-inch version, which I probably would have loved for lounging, but it would’ve pushed the chaise even further into the entryway. The 36-inch depth ended up being the right call. For reference, I’m five four, and the width of the sofa is enough for me to lie across without feeling cramped.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Sloan fits my living room so perfectly, several friends have commented that it looks like it was custom-made for the space (which it was!). My living room borders a narrow entry hall, and I worried the chaise might jut out too far and turn into a tripping hazard. But all the careful measuring (and light agonizing) paid off; the Sloan doesn’t block any walkways, and it visually harmonizes with the décor of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA nice feature: The Sloan’s chaise is reversible, so you can switch it from left to right depending on your layout. While it’s not fully \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-modular-sofas\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emodular\u003c/a\u003e, it does offer some flexibility—reconfiguring the chaise takes a few steps (disconnecting the clips underneath and possibly reinstalling the legs), but it’s manageable and a great option if I move or rearrange my space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Sloan works neatly as a \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-sectionals-for-small-spaces\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esectional for a small space\u003c/a\u003e in my roughly 196-square-foot living room, but it could easily suit a more open layout if you scaled up the frame.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"sit-test-is-it-comfortable-does-it-feel-well-made-does-the-couch-have-a-tendency-to-sag\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eSit test: Is it comfortable? Does it feel well made? Does the couch have a tendency to sag?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Sloan feels well-constructed and balanced. It’s not one of those ultra-cushy, sink-in couches, but I didn’t want that. I prefer furniture (mattresses included) that lean firmer and maintain their shape over time. That said, the sectional is not stiff or unforgiving by any means. The cushions have softened slightly with regular use, and the seat has just enough give to make it comfortable without feeling floppy. The chaise is wide and supportive enough to curl up without sliding around.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"lay-test-is-it-comfortable-does-it-feel-well-made-does-the-couch-have-a-tendency-to-sag\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eLay test: Is it comfortable? Does it feel well-made? Does the couch have a tendency to sag?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eDefinitely. I’ve stretched out on the chaise for movies, taken plenty of naps, and even spent the night on the main seat when my parents stayed in my bedroom. The cushions have held their shape well—no sagging or uneven spots. With the back cushions removed, the sofa doubles as a surprisingly roomy single bed for my height. While the standard down-alternative fill isn’t super plush, it’s plenty supportive. Worth noting: Interior Define does offer an even plusher down blend for an extra $300.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"is-the-sectional-suitable-for-particular-decor-styles-and-if-so-which\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs the sectional suitable for particular decor styles and, if so, which?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Sloan’s clean lines, softly rounded edges, and simple silhouette make it stylistically versatile—it works well with my mix of midcentury and Japandi influences, but it could easily suit more traditional or contemporary spaces depending on your fabric and leg choices. The deep green velvet and walnut leg I chose add richness and warmth without feeling overly formal or staunchly modern.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"is-it-durablepractical-in-a-modern-home-is-the-couch-kid-andor-dog-friendly\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs it durable/practical in a modern home? Is the couch kid- and/or dog-friendly?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have two cats, and the sectional has held up surprisingly well against their havoc—wrestling on the chaise, treating its sides like a scratching post, and near-constant shedding. While I wouldn’t call velvet a low-maintenance upholstery choice (it definitely attracts lint and pet hair), it has performed better than I expected. My last couch was chenille, and whenever my pets scratched it, the threads would start to pull and get stringy. That hasn’t happened here. Velvet has a short, dense pile that doesn’t snag the same way—so even when my cats do go to town with their claws, the fabric doesn’t show damage as obviously. I also specifically chose performance velvet, which has a more durable, tightly woven surface than some of the brand’s other options, like the brushed vintage velvet, which is finer and more delicate.
