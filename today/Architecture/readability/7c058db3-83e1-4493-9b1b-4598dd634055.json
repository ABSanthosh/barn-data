This 1,300-square-foot modern house, on the other hand, shows that colorful accents in the right places can turn a non-descript apartment into something unforgettable.“The owner, Nuria, told me that she wanted her home to convey a sense of peace,” says Rosana Fuster from Arkitandem, an architecture studio based in Valencia, Spain. “But she’s also this incredible whirlwind with a larger-than-life personality and we wanted that to be reflected in this project.”A view of the apartment with the kitchen to the left and the living area to the right. A Stool 60 seat, by Alvar Aalto for Artek, is in the foreground. Fuster’s words perfectly capture the two different sides of this apartment, which is also located in Valencia. On the one hand, it’s a simple and contemporary home in wood and white, filled with light. It embodies a feeling of relaxed well-being. On the other hand, there are a number of small details, surprising pop touches, that give this home its appealing energy and make it unique.The striking yellow hood above the stove was custom designed for the home. The kitchen’s back wall features Ferrés tiles. The most obvious example of the apartment’s colorful side is in the kitchen-living-dining-room area, where a custom hood in bright yellow is paired with a ceiling beam paintedin the same hue.The thermally efficient windows are from the Cor Vision series in matte white aluminum by Cortizo.

This was sometimes an advantage: It gave me a lot of flexibility when it came to redistributing the spaces since there weren’t any columns acting as obstacles in the central living area. But, on the other hand, the home’s large metal beams made it difficult to install some pieces,” Fuster says about this apartment that dates to the 1960s.The living room-kitchen has sweeping views of Valencia’s Jardín de Turia, a park located in the former riverbed where the Turia once flowed. The sofa is from Ferm Living. Rather than work against those difficult beams, Fuster decided to embrace them and turn them into essential components of the project. “That’s when we decided to leave them exposed and paint them yellow,” she says.The 12.5-foot-long table in the living area is used for eating, gathering, and as a work area. That decision to emphasize the beams was key to giving the 1,300-square-foot home some of its distinctive attitude. Other details continue the embrace of color like the orange-and-white tiles in the kitchen, the wallpaper with a Roy Lichtenstein look in the children’s bathroom, and the lamps with warm gradients found in the principal bathroom.Colorful details bring this house to life. Beyond the colorful details, the larger goal of this complete renovation was to adapt a dated home from the 1960s to the needs of its new inhabitants, a couple with two daughters, ages nine and 11. “It was a home with too many partitions, corridors, and small rooms and we have now completely transformed the layout. Our primary goal was to create three independent and clearly defined areas: the girls’ area, the parents’ area, and the living room-kitchen, where all four members of the family come together,” the architect explains.European oak is found throughout the home. When the renovation was complete, the results exceeded expectations: “The family’s needs and preferences were key to redefining the new areas of the house. Now, all the spaces in the house are lived in; even the hallways and the dressing room become places where the different members of the family can interact,” Fuster concludes.This modern house tour was first published by AD Spain. It was translated by John Newton.“It was a home with too many partitions, corridors, and small rooms and we have now completely transformed the layout,” says Fuster. The bathroom’s faucets are by Iconic. Dipping Light sconces by Marset. The wallpaper in the children’s bathroom is from Bien Fait, based in Paris. The powder room also doubles as an entryway to the children’s bedrooms. In the background, the bedroom of one of the couple’s daughters. The two children’s bedrooms have identical access to a shared bathroom. A view into kitchen from one of the children’s rooms.",
