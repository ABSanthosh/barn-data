Niyodogawa Town in Kochi Prefecture is developing municipal housing as part of its efforts to support the local forestry industry and attract new residents. The residential project utilizes 30×105mm wooden studs, a material typically exported for Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) panels, to construct the entire building without the use of glued panels or plywood. Designed for efficient disassembly and relocation, the structure maximizes the use of locally sourced timber, reducing both costs and CO2 emissions while strengthening the regional supply chain.all images by Tomoyuki Kusunose unless stated otherwiseVUILD uses wooden studs sourced from Niyodogawa’s forestsVUILD’s architectural team designs structural components to be under three meters in length to align with the capabilities of a small CNC router (ShopBot) installed in the town. By processing timber locally—from milling and drying to fabrication and assembly—the project minimizes transportation requirements and intermediaries, reducing environmental impact while promoting economic circulation within the community. The project presents a model for sustainable construction that integrates forestry practices with housing production, demonstrating a localized approach to material sourcing and building processes.VUILD completes Niyodo River Stud House using only locally sourced wooden planksthe sustainable housing project supports the forestry industry in Niyodogawa Townthe structure is built without glued panels or plywood, using only wooden studs",
