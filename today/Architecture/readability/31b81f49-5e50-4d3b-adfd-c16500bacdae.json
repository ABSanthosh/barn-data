  "text": "Maybe we shouldn’t be surprised that Nick Cannon’s house—which he offered fans a tour of in a recently uploaded YouTube video—looks like it belongs to Tom Hanks’s 12-year-old character from Big. After all, the multi-hyphenate has a dozen kids to entertain and certainly has the cash to do so with flair. In response to a question about a tabloid’s estimation that he pays $3 million in child support annually, Cannon told the Los Angeles Times last year that that was a paltry figure. “When you think about my lifestyle, I have to generate at least $100 million a year,” he said. With all that in mind, what do you imagine the entertainer keeps inside his home? A slide connecting the floors? A candy room? A ball pit? Well, yes—all of the above.Undoubtedly, the star feature of the home is the slide, which (naturally) deposits its rider into the aforementioned ball pit in the family room below. The comedian had a practical reason for eliminating his stairs in favor of a more whimsical amenity: “I got tired of walking down the steps and going to the kitchen or going to the living room, so I said, ‘I want to be able to slide into a ball pit at the front of my house.’”Cannon’s 13-year-old twins Moroccan and Monroe, whom he co-parents with Mariah Carey, help show off their dad’s lavish Saddle River, New Jersey, pad over the course of the 30-minute video (“I’m pretty sure like 80% of this stuff is expired,” Monroe says of the candy room’s offerings). Cannon moved into the 8,371-square-foot dwelling in 2015, the year after he and Carey split. Since then, Cannon has welcomed 10 more kids with five more partners—each of whom he has reportedly gifted a house.Join NowNew Year's Sale: Become an AD PRO member for only $20 $12 per monthArrow“Red is my favorite color,” the Masked Singer host says near the start of the video, as his daughter plays the opening notes of Kanye West’s “Runaway” at a cherry red piano in the double-height foyer. That factoid is soon made very, very clear; the slide and the ball pit are also red, as is the huge sectional at the center of the family room, the chandelier above, the velvet ropes that partition the area, the dramatically swooping drapes, and the nearby pair of ginormous bean bags.Other fun features of the estate include custom Louis Vuitton Iron Man masks, a sword, a “Godfather motif” study, an all-black dining room complete with a suit of armor, a movie theater filled with countless pillows in lieu of furniture, and a private lake in the backyard, where Cannon ends the video. “That’s my duck,” he quips, pointing out a bird chilling on the water.The man really wasn’t kidding when he referred to himself as “the dad that is a big kid.”",
