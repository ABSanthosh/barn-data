The entire 37-year process earned an Advocacy Citation of Merit at the 2024 Modernism in America Awards last month.  \"We understand that frustration, but we would have had to have made the entire structure accessible and install an elevator,\" Marmol explained of the exhibition's limitations. \"It’s tiny, the stairs are too narrow and steep, the doors are too narrow. There was no way to comply with ADA accessibility and fire safety codes without redesigning the entire house.\"",
