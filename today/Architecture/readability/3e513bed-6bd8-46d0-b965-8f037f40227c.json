They have become particularly known for their commitment to human-centered, community-driven designs that not only serve the needs of their users but also enrich the environments around them. This year, they were recognized as the Popular Choice Winner for Best Sustainable Firm in Architizer’s prestigious A+Awards. Founded in 1942, ZGF has evolved from a small practice in Portland, Oregon, into a national leader with offices across the United States. Known for its collaborative approach and holistic design philosophy, the firm’s dedication to creating impactful spaces has led to a portfolio of work that spans multiple sectors. In recent years, ZGF has a growing portfolio of net-zero energy buildings, green infrastructure, and LEED-certified projects. ZGF’s approach to sustainability is not just about reducing environmental impact but designing for the future, creating buildings that respond to the urgent need for resilience. The Assembly Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Popular Choice Winner, Higher Education \u0026 Research Facilities, 12th Annual A+Awards The Assembly in Pittsburgh is transforming the historic Ford Motor Plant into a cutting-edge biomedical research hub, symbolizing a new era of innovation for the city. Originally one of 31 Model T assembly plants in the U.S., the building now houses the University of Pittsburgh and Hillman Cancer Center, consolidating academic research and private industry under one roof. The design retains much of the plant’s original architectural character, including the vertical crane shed, now repurposed as a collaborative atrium. A new lab tower complements the historic structure, showcasing how adaptive reuse can breathe new life into industrial spaces for the future. PAE Living Building Portland, Oregon The PAE Living Building in Portland, Oregon, is the world’s largest commercial office building to meet Living Building Challenge standards, proving that sustainable, mixed-use developments can be financially viable. Designed to last 500 years, the five-story structure generates 108% of its energy through solar panels, meets all water needs through onsite rainwater capture, and prioritizes occupant comfort with operable windows and healthy materials. The building blends modern sustainability with timeless aesthetics, showing how commercial buildings can benefit both urban environments and the planet. California Air Resources Board Southern California Headquarters, Mary D. Nichols Campus Riverside, California Since 1967, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) has led the world in setting vehicle emissions standards to improve public health and combat climate change. Known for innovations like the catalytic converter and exposing Volkswagen’s diesel emissions scandal, CARB now showcases its commitment to sustainability with a new net-zero energy headquarters. Designed by ZGF, the 403,306-square-foot (37,470-square-meter) facility consolidates CARB’s Southern California operations and serves as one of the world’s most advanced vehicle testing centers. The LEED Platinum certified building incorporates renewable energy, including a large solar array, and features 140 EV charging stations, aligning with California’s climate policies. Camp Namanu Accessibility \u0026 Inclusion Redesign Sandy, Oregon Camp Fire Columbia, dedicated to supporting historically oppressed communities, particularly LGBTQIA2S+ youth, operates Camp Namanu, one of Oregon’s largest and oldest youth camps. Situated on 550 acres (222 hectares) along the Sandy River, the camp has served generations for nearly a century. In 2021, Camp Fire Columbia partnered with ZGF to update Camp Namanu’s facilities, focusing on accessibility, inclusivity, and equity. The first phase, completed in 2022, reimagined the Sherwood Unit with ADA-accessible pathways, improved privacy and safety features, and new cabins designed to balance communal connection with individual privacy and comfort. University of California, San Francisco, Nancy Friend Pritzker Psychiatry Building San Francisco, California The UCSF Nancy Friend Pritzker Psychiatry Building addresses the critical need for mental health care by providing a welcoming, transparent, and accessible facility in the Bay Area. Integrating pediatric, neurological, and mental health services, it quadruples access to care while fostering research and collaboration. Designed by ZGF with Perkins\u0026Will, the building prioritizes patient comfort with abundant natural light, uplifting aesthetics, and features like a rooftop garden and nature-inspired art. The facility brings together multiple UCSF disciplines, enhancing interdisciplinary collaboration and setting a new standard for mental health treatment and research. Portland International Airport Main Terminal Expansion Portland, Oregon Portland International Airport, named “America’s Best Airport,” has completed a major expansion designed by ZGF Architects to accommodate 35 million passengers annually. The project doubles the terminal’s size, blending innovative architecture with the beauty of the Pacific Northwest. A locally sourced wood roof honors the region’s forestry heritage, supported by Y-shaped columns and skylights. The expanded ticket hall offers travelers a forest-like experience with biophilic design, while clear sight lines and regional goods enhance the passenger journey. Sustainability and resiliency are key, with the use of renewable materials, seismic base isolation and carbon reduction strategies leading the effort.
