  "text": "In the heart of Ermionida, Greece, a former machinery workshop has been given a vibrant new identity as a dynamic and contemporary living space. Apartment V, a project by Anastasia Naki of Naki Atelier, breathes new life into a once-industrial setting, integrating modern design elements while paying homage to its past. Spanning 807 square feet, the residence is strategically designed to optimize natural light. A wall of glass blocks surround the front entrance allowing light to enter the space while also prioritizing privacy. With only one external-facing facade, the architectural team prioritized its design to flood the interior with daylight, enhancing both ambiance and energy efficiency. The layout is thoughtfully structured, dividing the home into two primary zones. The private section, containing two bedrooms and a bathroom, is accessible via a corridor that extends from the kitchen. Meanwhile, the public area of the apartment is an expansive, open-plan living area that combines various functions without compromising comfort or aesthetic appeal. A defining feature of the renovation is a suspended steel loft – in a cherry red hue that is seen throughout the space – which serves multiple purposes. Hovering above the kitchen and dining space, this mezzanine area acts as an additional relaxation zone while simultaneously shaping the perception of height in the room. The elevated structure provides a sense of intimacy, counterbalancing the generous 14-foot-high ceilings. By incorporating this level, the design maintains an open connection between different parts of the apartment while ensuring a warm and inviting atmosphere. Leading up to the mezzanine and suspended from the back of the kitchen island, the floating staircase makes a 90-degree turn midway up and continues to the top with added treads that tie the red between the two floors. The material selection reflects both the industrial history of the space and a bold contemporary vision. A red steel framework anchors the design, echoing the building’s original function, while stainless steel custom-made furniture reinforces the industrial aesthetic. To balance these raw, robust elements, the interior features Tinos green marble, bold-hued tiles, thick textiles, and raw birch plywood – each adding texture and warmth to the space.
