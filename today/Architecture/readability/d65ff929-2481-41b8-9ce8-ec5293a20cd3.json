  "text": "iacopo capone-doumas’ ART FILLS minimal APARTMENT with colorThe vibrant, summer-inspired artworks of Iacopo Capone-Doumas transform a minimalist apartment in the heart of Athens, Greece, into a serene urban hideaway where simplicity meets artistic expression. Designed in collaboration with Michail Architects as both a personal sanctuary and an immersive art studio/showroom, the clean interior, with its muted palette and simple lines, allows the curated artworks to take center stage. ‘With its summer-inspired energy, clean design, and colorful palette—reflecting my artistic identity— I intended to create a refreshing escape from urban monotony,’ Capone-Doumas explains. ‘This space allows the artworks to shine while inviting guests into a transformative and uplifting experience.’In his work, Iacopo Capone-Doumas transforms his passion for surfing and the ocean into colorful paintings and sculptures. Throughout the apartment, the Athens-based artist’s pieces, created specifically for the space, radiate warmth and positivity. An installation of three surfboards in gradient blues meets text-based canvases in vibrant yellows, purples, and oranges, while motifs of the sea and sun take over the walls in the form of sculptural pieces and paintings. all images by Yiorgos Kaplanidis, courtesy of Iacopo Capone-DoumasA VIBRANT ART HIDEAWAY IN THE CENTER OF ATHENSEvery detail throughout the apartment in Kolonaki, the Greek capital’s upscale central neighborhood, has been carefully thought out to achieve a well-curated balance of minimalism and artistic expression. With creative direction by Iacopo Capone-Doumas and interior design by Athens-based Michail Architects, the studio apartment evolves around an open-plan space that integrates the kitchen, dining, and living area. Ample natural light enters the space through floor-to-ceiling openings that visually connect the interior with the energy of the urban landscape. The monochromatic kitchen dissolves into the white interior palette, while architectural lighting by CPLD – Christos Papachristos illuminates Capone-Doumas’ artworks. Subtly referencing the waves of the ocean, a gentle curve on the ceiling adds depth to the space through the playful interplay of light and shadows. On the other side of this space, a set of three rotating wooden doors with white-painted surfaces and exposed natural wood at the base serves as a dynamic partition between the living room and bedroom. Inside, the artworks’ bold red stripes and sky-blue hues infuse the otherwise subdued space with color and energy. ‘The space itself becomes an experience—an invitation into a vibrant, dreamlike world,’ Iacopo Capone-Doumas notes.an installation of three surfboards in gradient blue meets text-based canvasesrotating doors separate the bedroom from the living areaAthens-based artist Iacopo Capone-Doumas",
