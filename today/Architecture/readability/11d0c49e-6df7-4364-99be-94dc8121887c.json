  "text": "Retro-Futurism Meets Car Culture in GARAGE by DDDDGARAGE, designed by DDDD Creative Company, is located in the basement of the Poly Theater in Shenzhen‘s commercial district. The project is a multi-functional commercial space centered around vintage modified cars, transforming the original car park into a hub for car culture. The design incorporates a Special Vehicle Exchange Center theme, combining a range of automotive-related services such as vintage car exhibitions, car tuning, maintenance, and retail of accessories, alongside lifestyle elements like a cigar and coffee club.The concept of retro-futurism serves as the foundation of the design, blending vintage automotive culture with futuristic elements. Drawing on the aesthetics of the industrial era and retro influences, the space features materials like oxidized brass, vintage tiles, old shop gates, and American neon signs. A UFO-themed gas station and the use of silver materials and aluminum textures add a futuristic layer. The combination of these elements blurs the boundaries between the past and the future reflecting the stylistic positioning of GARAGE.all images courtesy of DDDD Creative CompanyHollywood-Inspired Design Divides GARAGE into Three ZonesThe design by DDDD Creative Company follows a narrative inspired by Hollywood films, creating an atmosphere akin to a modified car underworld. The space is divided into three distinct zones, each with its own identity. The front zone features a black driveway entrance, the gray middle zone consists of a commercial street with cement and stainless steel finishes, and the back zone is dedicated to used car trading with gold accents. The three levels correspond to the backgrounds of the three different classes of characters in the storyline, namely, the car trader, the street driver, and the boss. As the first vintage garage complex in the Greater Bay Area, GARAGE also engages with local culture, particularly Shenzhen’s identity as a youthful and fast-paced city. The space serves as a car-mediated vault for classic and modified cars, offering car enthusiasts an immersive experience.GARAGE’s design blends retro-futurism with modern elementsCinematic spatial narration arranges spaces within GARAGEThe entrance to the underground garage features a striking round illuminated fixture inspired by 1950s-60s American flying saucer-shaped gas stations. Columns in the space are reimagined as semi-circular lamp panels with mirrors that create a futuristic, eye-catching effect. Nearby, the underground café is positioned next to the car wash and maintenance shop, allowing customers to watch their vehicles being serviced while enjoying coffee. The café design features a warm palette of caramel wood tones, pink marble, and black limestone floors, paired with vintage furniture and vinyl records to create a cozy, retro atmosphere. Separate sections for vinyl and cigars further enhance the experience.Adjacent to the café, the car accessories shop features an old iron scissor-shaped gate, echoing Hong Kong and Taiwan’s vintage garage style. Inside, lacquered wood and marble finishes contrast to create a high-end, vintage aesthetic. The car wash area continues this industrial theme, with black tiles, grey walls, and aluminum panel doors. Large, black iron-framed windows contribute to a mechanical industrial assembly line feel, referencing Chicago’s architectural style. Inspired by the 1985 sci-fi film ‘Back to the Future,’ the car tuning room uses aircraft aluminum and LED screens to create a space that evokes time travel. The folding doors and circular light panels enhance the futuristic atmosphere. As cars are elevated by electric lifts, mirrored walls reflect the vehicles, creating an illusion of movement through time and space, transforming the experience into a cinematic journey.oxidized brass, vintage tiles, old shop gates, and neon signs, reflect retro automotive culturethe space narrative draws from Hollywood films, creating an underworld-like ambiancedivided into three zones, each section represents a different class of movie charactersgold accents in the back zone emphasize the luxury of the classic car trading area",
