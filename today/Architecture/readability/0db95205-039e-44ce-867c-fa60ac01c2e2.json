This 1,300-square-foot modern house, on the other hand, shows that colorful accents in the right places can turn a non-descript apartment into something unforgettable.“The owner, Nuria, told me that she wanted her home to convey a sense of peace,” says Rosana Fuster from Arkitandem, an architecture studio based in Valencia, Spain. “But she’s also this incredible whirlwind with a larger-than-life personality and we wanted that to be reflected in this project.”A view of the apartment with the kitchen to the left and the living area to the right. A Stool 60 seat, by Alvar Aalto for Artek, is in the foreground. Fuster’s words perfectly capture the two different sides of this apartment, which is also located in Valencia. On the one hand, it’s a simple and contemporary home in wood and white, filled with light. It embodies a feeling of relaxed well-being. On the other hand, there are a number of small details, surprising pop touches, that give this home its appealing energy and make it unique.The striking yellow hood above the stove was custom designed for the home. The kitchen’s back wall features Ferrés tiles.",
