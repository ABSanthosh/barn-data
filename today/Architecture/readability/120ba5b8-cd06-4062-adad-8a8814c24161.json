The jury commended the balance of heritage and innovation in this year's field of selected projects. Dubai-based Killa Design managed to place two of their projects on the list this year, with the Jumeirah Marsa Al Arab in the UAE and the Shebara resort in Saudi Arabia.\"The common thread between these sixteen extraordinary hotels is the fact that they all elevate expertise and local heritage,\" noted the Prize's Secretary General, Jérôme Gouadain.Take a look at the top hotel designs for 2025 below, and explore recent Prix Versailles selections for the World's Most Beautiful Museums, Sports Venues \u0026 Passenger Stations, Campuses, Airports, Emporiums, Museums, and Restaurants.Mandarin Oriental Qianmen Beijing, China by Cheng Chung Design Mandarin Oriental Qianmen Beijing, China by Cheng Chung Design © Mandarin Oriental Qianmen, Beijing Project description: \"In the heart of a traditional hutong neighbourhood, Mandarin Oriental Qianmen reveals a little slice of the city that makes this a truly one-of-a-kind property. Through its 42 perfectly restored houses, each with its own inner courtyard-cum-outdoor lounge, the hotel offers an immersion that is both subtle and extraordinary, driven by authentic architecture featuring original materials. Almost everything here has been preserved: every brick and tile, not to mention wooden frames and beams, carvings, gates, piers and columns. The contemporary interiors, arranged by Cheng Chung Design, are a blend of modern techniques and oriental aesthetics.\"Jumeirah Marsa Al Arab, Dubai, United Arab Emirates by Killa Design Jumeirah Marsa Al Arab, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Killa Design © Killa Design Project description: \"With the Jumeirah Marsa Al Arab, [Killa Design] has unveiled a stationary yet airy vessel, the final instalment of the 'trilogy' of hotels inspired by the ocean. Flanked by the sail-shaped Jumeirah Burj Al Arab and the wave-like Jumeirah Beach Hotel, the establishment delivers a new expression of Dubai’s seafaring legacy on a peninsula that also serves as a pier.\"Rosewood Munich, Munich, Germany by Tara Bernerd \u0026 Partners Rosewood Munich, Munich, Germany, Tara Bernerd \u0026 Partners © Davide Lovatti Project description: \"In the heart of Bavaria’s capital city and housed in two magnificently restored landmark buildings featuring Baroque and Rococo architecture, Rosewood Munich could easily be the home of a rich and distinguished ambassador. In fact, the hotel occupies the former Bavarian State Bank headquarters and Palais Neuhaus-Preysing, an aristocratic residence. This causes a surprising sensation – especially given the setting in the heart of the old town – when guests set foot inside its peaceful, discreet and muted atmosphere. With its décor carefully crafted by Tara Bernerd \u0026 Partners, Rosewood Munich offers a collection of memorable spaces for travellers to enjoy, including a spa and an indoor pool, where the magic of the place provides holistic wellness like an ancient thermal bath house.\"Al Moudira, Luxor, Egypt by Olivier Sednaoui Al Moudira, Luxor, Egypt, Olivier Sednaoui © Al Moudira Project description: \"Al Moudira is an oasis designed in the early 2000s in Luxor, on the West Bank of the Nile, on a stretch of untouched sand facing the timeless silhouette of the Valley of the Kings. Launched at the initiative of Zeina Aboukheir, the hotel is a dream, a mirage the likes of which only the desert could elicit. Arranged around a series of ten interior courtyards and surrounded by 25 acres of palm groves, the palace took shape in 2002 under the guidance of architect Olivier Sednaoui. Hand-painted frescoes, traditional mashrabiya, and locally inspired design details appear throughout. Still, this is no pseudo-regional pastiche: the entire property asserts the prestigious past of cities like Alexandria, Cairo, Beirut and Damascus. Multiple influences – including the vast renovation and expansion project that was completed in 2024 by the new owner, Florian Amereller, and his team – have accrued a saga of architectural and artistic references drawn from the depths of time.\"Hôtel du Couvent, Nice, France by Festen Architecture Hôtel du Couvent, Nice, France, Festen Architecture © Giulio Ghirardi Project description: \"Tucked away on 10,000 square metres of greenery in the heights of Nice’s Old Town, just a few minutes’ walk from the seashore, Hôtel du Couvent is a place of quiet reflection. As suggested by its name, the hotel was a 17th-century convent. It has been restored with care to its original essence, at the initiative of Valéry Grégo and with the support of Festen Architecture – using natural materials and no pastiche. The establishment celebrates the rituals of a monastic life that no longer exists, with the restaurant occupying the old refectory, and with the bakery and herbal pharmacy returned to their original locations. In this way, the hotel cultivates an uncommon atmosphere, albeit with no explicit mention of religion, that is conducive to tranquillity and well-being.\"Hôtel Hana, Paris, France by Laura Gonzalez Hôtel Hana, Paris, France by Laura Gonzalez​ © Stephan Julliard Project description: \"Hana is Japanese for 'flower.' It also means 'compliment' in Arabic. And now, it stands for 'bliss' in French. In this neighbourhood known as Little Tokyo, the dialogue developed here by architect Laura Gonzalez – a fusion of early 20th century Belle Epoque maximalism with Japanese minimalism – makes this hotel a perfectly Parisian establishment. And yet, the muted atmosphere maintained by clean lines and traditionally inspired furniture (custom-made for the hotel), from public areas to guest rooms, envelops visitors in an instant change of scene that is great for helping tired or hurried travellers relax and unwind.\"Mandarin Oriental Mayfair, London, UK by RSHP Mandarin Oriental Mayfair, London, UK by RSHP © Mandarin Oriental Mayfair, London Project description: \"Located on Hanover Square with architecture entrusted to RSHP, Mandarin Oriental Mayfair provides a novel link between the worlds of art, fashion and history. From sumptuous guest rooms crafted by Studio Indigo to ultra- contemporary public areas designed by Curiosity, the hotel’s personality is revealed in its extremely well-curated composition. The brand’s Asian roots are subtly underscored by a palette of soft tones and rich textures, as well as by bespoke furnishings that further contribute to the establishment’s charm. The large sculptural lobby and reception to the spa boast rare green Ming marble in a reflection of the vegetation of Hanover Square, Berkeley Square and Green Park. Lastly, 'a walk in the park' and the natural elements of wind, water, earth and fire inspired the spectacular décor of the restaurant Akira Back and the staircase leading to Dosa by Akira Back, the Korean chef’s table.\"Ran Baas The Palace, Patiala, India by Abha Narain Lambah Ran Baas The Palace, Patiala, India by Abha Narain Lambah​ © Ran Baas The Palace Project description: \"It was a real event in Punjab when, after 80 years of abandonment, Ran Baas reopened in November 2024 within the oldest Sikh fort (Qila Mubarak). After undergoing painstaking restoration work, it became the region’s first luxury palace hotel. The government brought in architect Abha Narain Lambah to supervise this revival of traditional crafts. By adding few contemporary touches that only elevate the Mughal and Sikh architecture – featuring a spa within the royal kitchens and restaurants in the erstwhile throne room – Lambah and Priya Paul (Chairperson of Park Hotels) have more than met the challenge of preserving the site’s historical integrity, using authentic materials to restore its lost grandeur by creating a visual palette that reflects the richness of Punjabi aesthetics.\"Palazzo Talìa, Rome, Italy by Studio Luca Guadagnino Palazzo Talìa, Rome, Italy by Studio Luca Guadagnino © Palazzo Talìa Project description: \"Built in the early 1500s, Palazzo Talìa was the residence of Angelo Colocci, a humanist and secretary to Pope Leo X. After being acquired by Cardinal Michelangelo Tonti, one of whose titles included Titular Archbishop of Nazareth, the building became known as the Collegio Nazareno. The hotel opened its doors in May 2024, the meticulous restoration carried out by Studio Luca Guadagnino having revived its former radiance and instilled it with a perfectly contemporary yet unostentatious spirit. For guests staying in one of its 26 rooms and suites, it’s impossible to provide an exhaustive description of the rich artistry deployed throughout the 5,000 square metres of space, from its façades decorated with Medici rings, lion mouths and buffalo heads to Bar Musa with its 17th century Grotesque ceilings, by way of frescoes, chandeliers, sculptures and more.\"Romeo Roma, Rome, Italy by Zaha Hadid Architects Romeo Roma, Rome, Italy by Zaha Hadid Architects​ © Chris Dalton Project description: \"How does one establish a dialogue between past and present inside a palazzo that dates back to 1590? Zaha Hadid Architects managed to write a particularly complete chapter on the subject, released in December 2024, in which the English studio’s vocabulary manipulated and rewrote the existing construction in one fluid motion that enabled every imaginable contemporary, almost organic, stroke of boldness, without ever undermining the enduring identity of this ancient building. Custom-made furnishings, crafted by internationally renowned artisans, further magnify the perfectly restored interiors. Zaha Hadid’s pioneering spirit is evident in the design’s voluptuous curves and futuristic aesthetic. A distinctive feature is the transparent pool, which encapsulates this historical layering by allowing guests to observe the archaeological finds discovered during the renovation work. And on a small terrace, there grows a centuries- old olive tree.\"MGallery Sosei Sapporo, Sapporo, Japan by Taiji Fujimoto of Studio Crowe MGallery Sosei Sapporo, Sapporo, Japan by Taiji Fujimoto of Studio Crowe​ © MGallery Sosei Sapporo Project description: \"Like its industrial façade and extraordinary interiors featuring a multitude of works of art, Sosei Sapporo is a dazzling world of contrasts, combining Western-style salons with Japanese living quarters. Nothing could be more authentic or historic than this development in which epochs collide, a reflection of what transpired on the island of Hokkaido during the Meiji era (1868- 1912), when the country opened up to the West and laid the foundations of its industrial modernity. In fact, the Kaitakushi Brewery – the birthplace of Sapporo Beer, founded in 1876 on the banks of the Sōsei River that gave the site its name – was already a landmark of the region’s now well-established modernisation. Today, it is a boutique property where heritage, design, and quiet luxury converge. Its warm minimalism pairs with tactile elegance for a refined experience, in a concoction 'brewed' by Taiji Fujimoto of Studio Crowe.\"Todos Santos Boutique Hotel, Todos Santos, Mexico by Alejandra Sarmiento Legorreta Todos Santos Boutique Hotel, Todos Santos, Mexico by Alejandra Sarmiento Legorreta​ © Todos Santos Boutique Hotel Project description: \"Todos Santos Boutique Hotel is a jewel of Baja California Sur, where thoughtful design meets authentic soul. Brick arcades and open hallways – typical of the region’s architecture – blur the lines between interior and exterior, while the original façade was preserved in homage to the town’s heritage. Here, as in the rest of the country, frescoes are the preferred cultural medium for celebrating history. In the village of Todos Santos ('All the Saints'), this former schoolhouse bears witness to the tradition of frescoes in its lobby, where an original remains intact, its surface marked by preserved gunshot impacts that echo untold stories. Each of the ten guest rooms is set against a backdrop of exuberant nature and features a hand-painted fresco mural recounting the legacy of the Catholic missions that once shaped the culture of the peninsula. And at the bar La Copa, visitors behold murals that narrate the history of the region’s missions, sugar mills and native flora and fauna. Together, these spaces revisited by Alejandra Sarmiento Legorreta form a sanctuary of culture and elegance.\"Shebara, Sheybarah Island, Saudi Arabia by Killa Design Shebara, Sheybarah Island, Saudi Arabia by Killa Design © Red Sea Global 2025 Project description: \"The future made real: this was what the studio Killa Design had in store for the biggest fans of innovation and immersion in nature when it brought Shebara to life. The eco-resort – which boasts its own solar farm and water desalination and treatment plant – exemplifies the encounter between visionary design and luxury. Located 25 kilometres off the coast of Saudi Arabia, the island is home to dense mangroves, desert flora, rolling sand dunes, turtle nesting grounds and coral reefs. Inspired by the natural formation of pearls in the sea and crafted from polished stainless steel, Shebara’s villas reflect and refract the sky and sea, appearing to dissolve into the horizon. These orbs cantilevered over the water give the impression of floating weightlessly.\"Raffles Sentosa Singapore, Singapore, Singapore by Yabu Pushelberg Raffles Sentosa Singapore, Singapore, Singapore by Yabu Pushelberg​ © Raffles Sentosa Singapore Project description: \"Known as a 'City in Nature,' Singapore now possesses a peaceful, luxuriant sanctuary of villas, designed by Yabu Pushelberg, that is unlike any other on the island and just 15 minutes from the city centre. After a spectacular clifftop arrival on Sentosa Island and against the backdrop of the South China Sea, guests can escape the futuristic cityscape to (re)discover the seasoned reception that awaits them at Raffles Sentosa Singapore. A lush green setting for a brand that was founded in 1887… in Singapore! Scattered across 100,000 square metres of greenery, the 62 villas are so many private havens of peace. Meandering footpaths lead to dining spaces and hidden nooks, all the way down to the seashore. A pair of hundred-year-old ficus trees plus crystal chandeliers inspired by the Papilionanthe Miss Joaquim orchid (Singapore’s national flower) create a connection between past and future, where urban and rural melt into one.\"The Manner, New York, United States by Hannes Peer The Manner, New York, United States by Hannes Peer © Chris Mottalini / The Manner Project description: \"SoHo today may no longer be the neighbourhood of artists and lofts, but The Manner, which opened there in September 2024, seems to be breathing new life into that bygone era. Behind the discreet entrance to a building with the earmarks of a high-class residence, the hotel reveals an extremely joyful assembly of plentiful, generously arty features. In a vibrant tribute to Italy, the Milanese architect Hannes Peer has given each room its own dazzling look. Ochres, deep blues, and sand tones, contrasting with dark woods and red and navy lacquered finishes, reaffirm the oneness and the personality of the setting as a whole. The handmade furniture and artwork – including pieces by Nicholas Shurey, Giovanni de Francesco and Alex Proba – endow each space with its own character: here a residential atmosphere, there a gentle(wo)men’s club… Meanwhile, Elvira Solana’s murals tell the story of a journey through New York, blending nostalgia and modernity.\"Namia River Retreat, Hội An, Vietnam by T3 Architects Namia River Retreat, Hội An, Vietnam by T3 Architects​ © Namia River Retreat Project description: \"The regenerative holiday is one of the latest paradigms of luxury. In response to the chaos of the world today, Namia River Retreat is nestled within a fishing village on a quiet islet along the labyrinthine Thu Bồn River. Here, traditional Vietnamese herbal therapies and daily wellness rituals honour the rhythms of the body and the land, reminiscent of the grace and heart of the hydrotherapy treatments that were so popular in the 19th century. The spirit and architectural soul of the place, designed by T3 Architects, are inscribed in the timber-framed villas on stilts that preserve native plantlife and wildlife. Every detail, from hand-crafted décor to herbal gardens, tells a story – of resilience, beauty and local wisdom.\" Some current competitions on Bustler that may interest you...

tell the story\nof a journey through New York, blending\nnostalgia and modernity.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNamia River Retreat, Hội An, Vietnam by T3
