  "text": "The life cycle of an iconic house is complex. New owners can upset its balance, but it also must be capable of evolving with time. After all, a home is a space built to be lived in. Ezequiel Pini, an Argentinian-born digital artist and designer who is the creative force behind the studio Six N. Five, has found a house that suits him in Casa Riera, more commonly known by its nickname Casa Semienterrada (Half-Buried House), a place whose pioneering spirit connects with his own.Built at the end of the 1980s by the architect Javier Barba, the house was selected by the European Commission as part of the Project Monitor Program in 1989 as an example of one of the best sustainable homes in the world. The roof follows the slope of the mountain, minimizing the visual impact on the landscape. This solution also provides excellent thermal and acoustic insulation thanks to the vegetation. Designed by Barcelona architect Javier Barba in 1986 and located in the Maresme region, to the north of the city, this house was Barba’s first bioclimatic residence. The building, which disappears into the landscape of a mountainous coastal area, was revolutionary for its time—and remains an inspiration for other architects to this day. So much so that we covered it in print in 1987. Barba would achieve that recognition a dozen more times, and one of his properties in Menorca was on the cover in 1992. He was also named to the AD100 list in 2002, 2004, and 2010.The architect’s works have frequently been featured in Architectural Digest since 1987, including a cover story in a special 1992 issue on Spain. He was also included as a prominent figure of the 20th century in the special One Hundred Years of Design. The house is located on a sloping site, with a road along its higher end and views of a pine forest and the Mediterranean. The architect explored the location for days, “morning, noon, and night, to understand the geography and the existing vegetation,” he recalls, until he came to the conclusion that a semi-buried house, with a green roof, would be the best way to integrate the construction into the environment. His goal was always to “create a dramatic and exciting façade that wouldn’t interfere with the landscape, that would fuse its materiality with the granite rocks of the area,” he explains. Walls of concrete mixed with quartz, feldspar, and mica create a unique stony effect, accompanied by various plants native to the region.Once inside, the large semicircular living room is the focal point of the house. The bedrooms, kitchen, and dining room are located within several rectangular, staggered volumes that face south to enjoy the views of the Mediterranean. Pini, who has just acquired the property, intends to renovate it while maintaining the character and personality of the original home. “The straight lines of the house, which are modular and even repetitive, are in a dialogue with the curves of the living room. The straight lines define the space, giving it a certain structure and order, and the circular shapes evoke fluidity,” explains Pini. The fact that it is hidden underground also allowed for a greater energy efficiency. In this sense, it reflects ideas of traditional architecture, “where the building adapts to the context and lifestyle of its residents, and where the depth of the connection with nature transforms how a place is inhabited,” says the architect and founder of the BC Estudio Group. The house blends into its environment so successfully that, during its construction, a German tourist entered the site and pitched a tent on the roof thinking it was open land.The goal (which was more than achieved) was for the house to connect with the environment and transform how its residents live. The house is also energy efficient, taking advantage of its location. Its integration with the landscape not only reduces the heating and cooling needs, but it also provides a deeper connection with nature. When Pini visited the house for the first time, he was amazed. “My first impression was of being in a work of art. When I arrived, I was mesmerized by the location, to the point of forgetting that I had come to see a house and, not knowing where to go, I stumbled across the entrance staircase. You immerse yourself in nature to enter. It has a magical quality,” he says. Inevitably, a friendship was forged with the original owners: “They have seen in my profile a continuation of their life in this house. My approach is as much about valuing as it is about engaging with the original architecture. I feel a deep connection with the house’s history and I want to preserve it as much as possible,” he adds.A view of the house’s pool. For Pini, sustainability is a principle that goes beyond just a choice of green materials or a focus on renewable energy resources. “It’s about creating spaces and objects that integrate with the environment and respect its rhythm,” he explains. He also intends to construct an artist’s studio on an adjoining plot, which will represent a natural evolution of the material and eco-responsible aspects of the original buildings. “I want my work in this place to expand in harmony with the environment, using different materials, with increasingly blurred boundaries. I would like my digital work not only to complement the house, but to transform it.” He is thinking about adding sculptures that change in real time with the weather or the seasons and that interact with the rocks without being perceived as an interruption. “We are on our way to an increasingly hybrid world. Creating imaginary, digital vegetation gives me a similar feeling to the one I experience when I am taking care of a plant in a real garden. It becomes a meditative practice.”The wisdom accumulated over the course of the long career of Javier Barba (left), who is still a practicing architect, connects with the sensibility of Ezequiel Pini (right) and his explorations around “the eternal and the ephemeral, the structured and the organic, and how to use current technology to improve sustainability.” Barba and Pini chat as they stroll along the deck. Both the architect and the owner share a respect for nature and traditional eco-sensitive construction techniques combined with a passion for innovation that looks to the future. Barba was a pioneer of sustainable architecture, and Casa Riera marked a turning point in his career, recognized as one of the most sustainable homes in the world. Other later projects, such as the Binisafua development on the Mediterranean island of Menorca, are also integrated into the landscape. It won an award from the European Community for being an eco bioclimatic house. Today, his words show that his studio (where he continues to work together with his children) is still at the forefront of the movement: “In the not-too-distant future, new materials will allow us to build faster and focus more on energy efficiency, but it is also vital to promote environmental conservation and responsible building practices.” For Pini, getting to know the architect has been a privilege: “Javier Barba is very generous with his support and involvement when it comes to reimagining housing and how it might look in the future. We speak the same language. With our work, we creators leave seeds planted at a specific time, and it’s beautiful to see them reborn years later, as in this case.”This 1980s house was first published in issue 203 of AD Spain. It was translated by John Newton.A view of the living room, which still has the same structure and installation as the house did when it was first built.
