  "text": "The Community Production Center Las Tejedoras in Ecuador, designed by architects José Fernando Gómez and Juan Carlos Bamba for a collective of women weavers, has won the Mies Crown Hall Americas Prize. Located near the developing town of Guayaquil, the project was designed by Gómez of Natura Futura and Bamba to provide a space for local artisans and act as a contrast to local urban development that has resulted in deforestation. José Fernando Gómez and Juan Carlos Bamba have won the Mies Hall Crown Americas Prize\"The winning project, the Community Production Center Las Tejedoras, is infused with civic presence capable of dignifying the entire community,\" said Mies Crown Hall Americas Prize (MCHAP) jury member Maurice Cox. \"Acknowledging the significance of the community's local building practices, the project gives formal expression to local crafts and elevates their qualities.\" The winning project serves as a community centre for a collective of women weaversThe two-storey building consists of a rectangular clay brick core that wraps around a central courtyard. Teak wood supports hold up an expansive roof that hovers over the majority of the structure and is open above the centre. On each level, passageways are exposed to the elements and alternate between being fully open and tucked behind the brick walls, while large windows have been covered with teak wood screens. Open-air design, local materials and greenery serve to contrast local urban developmentThe open-air design responds to the surrounding climate, encouraging light and air to enter the building. \"With a design that draws on local materials such as teak wood and clay brick in an intricate herringbone pattern, the building's architecture not only celebrates tradition but also responds to the climate, ensuring natural ventilation and light,\" said MCHAP. Programming such as training areas, workshops, a store and community spaces are located within the building's large, open halls. Workshops, community spaces and a store are distributed throughout two levelsIts central courtyard was planted with native plants, such as guarumos and heliconias, to create a \"micro-climate\" that attracts local birds and insects. \"Located near Guayaquil, where rapid urban expansion has resulted in deforestation, the center serves as a counter-narrative, reintroducing native vegetation and fostering an environment that encourages biodiversity,\" said MCHAP. The building provides space for the weavers, who had lacked a suitable environment for their craft for years, and also serves as space for general community gatherings. The weaving collective also participated in the construction of the project. The building provides a space for local weavers to practice their craft\"The project not only provides employment in the community but also facilitates skill development through active participation in the construction process,\" said Cox. \"Notably, the structure stands as a physical symbol of community, reflecting the contributions of the local women in its construction.\" The building is organised around a central courtyardGómez and Bamba worked with the Ecuadorian organization Young Living Foundation on the project's development. Conceived by the Illinois Institute of Technology College of Architecture in 2013, the biennial MCHAP awards \"excellence\" in built projects throughout the Americas, taking a holistic approach that considers the integration of \"natural, built, and human ecologies\" in its recipients. Previous winners of the prize include a Mexico City museum extension by Taller Mauricio Rocha and a \"deceptively simple\" school in Peru by Taller Mauricio Rocha. The photography is by JAG Studio.
