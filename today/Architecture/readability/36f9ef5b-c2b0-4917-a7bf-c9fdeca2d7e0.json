  "text": "For centuries, the Netherlands has been a global design innovator; Dutch architects have long pushed the rest of the world to rethink what architecture can and should do. Holland’s contemporary building culture is no different, exemplified by the Delft-based design powerhouse Mecanoo. With its earliest projects focusing on social housing and urban renewal, the firm built its foundation with a strong user focus. They have made their name by designing buildings that are inextricable from their surroundings and demonstrating the power of design to open new possibilities for society. The key to Mecanoo’s change-making designs is a strong interdisciplinary approach — architecture, urban planning, landscape architecture and interior design — applied across typologies. Founded in 1984, this year marked 40 change-making years for the firm. And now, with an impressive list of recently completed projects and construction underway on a bevy of ambitious new designs, Mecanoo has been named Architizer’s Firm of the Year for the 12th Annual A+Awards. The firm will officially receive its prestigious prize at Architizer’s A+Awards Gala in Chengdu this November. Stay tuned for more coverage! More About A+Awards If Mecanoo’s work were encapsulated by a single word, it would be “connection.” Their structures are not only conceived to connect with a larger urban or environmental context, but they are also bridges from our contemporary moment to a better future; they also cultivate links between users and communities and the firm’s collaborative spirit — now across borders as they tackle global projects — connects cultures. Indeed, their projects are remarkable in how they distill the global nature of contemporary building culture down to a contextually local level, always bringing something new to the table. In the following interview, we sat down with Nuno Fontarra, an Associate Partner who has been with Mecanoo for over twenty years, to reflect on the firm’s past, present and future achievements. Tell us a little about your story — how did you get started? How did your firm grow? It all started from Mecanoo’s journey started in 1984 with a group of passionate students driven by creativity and the ambition to make a difference. 40 years later, while the firm has evolved, its mission remains unwavering: to design inspiring spaces that connect communities, adapt to future needs and remain socially relevant. Guided by our core philosophy of People, Place, Purpose, and Poetry. From the beginning, our focus has been on creating architecture that not only stands out for its beauty and functionality but also connects deeply with its surroundings and the communities it serves. This philosophy has guided us as we’ve continued to explore new ideas and embrace a multidisciplinary approach. Over the years, our team has expanded to include talented professionals from over 25 different nationalities. This diversity has been at the core of our success, bringing a rich variety of perspectives to every project we undertake and allowing us to design with a global mindset. Today, Mecanoo has a strong global presence, working on projects that span continents, yet we remain true to our Dutch roots. Our ability to adapt, innovate and engage with the unique cultural and social contexts of each location has been central to our evolution. This blend of local insight and global perspective has transformed Mecanoo from a Dutch firm into an internationally recognized architectural practice. National Kaohsiung Centre for the Arts (Wei-Wu-Ying) by Mecanoo, Kaohsiung, Taiwan Looking back, which of your projects do you feel was the most significant to the firm’s development and why? Looking back, I would say the Library Delft University of Technology, completed in 1998, stands out as one of the most significant projects in Mecanoo’s oeuvre. At the time, there wasn’t as much emphasis on sustainable architecture as there is today, but with this project, we were able to push boundaries and set a precedent for integrating sustainable design into large-scale public buildings. The library’s green roof was truly innovative for its time. Back in the time, the concept of green integration wasn’t new, however, how we executed it with a fully accessible, sloping grass roof that not only insulated the building but also created a recreational space for students and the public was unprecedented. This combination of landscape, architecture and sustainability, all within an educational environment, was one of the first of its kind. The project also marked a shift for Mecanoo in terms of how we approached design. It wasn’t just about creating a building, but about merging the building with its environment and making sustainability a core element of the architecture. The Library Delft University of Technology became the foundation for many of our later works, influencing how we think about sustainable design and the integration of green spaces into our buildings. Ultimately, the Library Delft University of Technology allowed Mecanoo to showcase our ability to innovate and think ahead, and it remains a milestone in our journey as a firm committed to creating spaces that are both visionary and sustainable. How do you feel your firm’s unique cultural and environmental context has shaped its evolution, particularly as it has expanded to design and build in countries outside of the Netherlands? A significant part of our success today is undeniably tied to the diversity within our team. While our roots are Dutch, the broad range of cultures, experiences and perspectives from our diverse architects have shaped a unique company culture that drives our ability to expand globally. This variety of cultural backgrounds enables us to approach each project with insights that go beyond merely addressing the physical environment. It’s about truly engaging with the social fabric and communities we design for, ensuring that our work resonates on a local level. This dynamic mix of global perspectives, combined with the Dutch spirit of innovation, allows us to create design solutions that are not only forward-thinking but also tailored to the specific needs and narratives of each location. It is this blend of local engagement and diverse viewpoints that has truly driven Mecanoo’s growth and evolution on the international stage. What does winning Architizer’s Firm of the Year Award mean to you and the firm? This recognition is a tremendous honour for all of us at Mecanoo. It is a celebration of our journey as a firm, as we have committed for over 40 years, from our early days in the Netherlands to becoming a truly global practice. This award acknowledges our years of dedication and inspires us to continue our mission of designing with purpose, always seeking to connect people, place, and culture through our work. It fuels our passion for innovation and reinforces our commitment to creating architecture that leaves a lasting, positive impact on the world. If you had one piece of advice to offer the next generation of architects, what would it be? At Mecanoo, one of our greatest strengths is the diversity within our team, and this has shaped the way we approach architecture. For the younger generation, I would encourage you to embrace your individuality and unique experiences. It’s easy to fall into the idea that there is a “normal” path to follow in design, but in reality, it’s the differences in who we are, where we come from, and how we see the world that add richness and depth to architecture. Every architect brings their own story, background, culture and personal experiences. At Mecanoo, we’ve learned that it’s these personal nuances, these diverse perspectives, that create the poetry and soul in architecture. The beauty of architecture lies in its ability to be different, to reflect the people it serves and the context it belongs to. So, I would say to the next generation: find your voice, celebrate what makes you different, and apply that uniqueness in your designs. It’s those small, personal touches that make architecture not just functional, but truly meaningful and special. Top image: Villa BW by Mecanoo, Schoorl, Netherlands",
