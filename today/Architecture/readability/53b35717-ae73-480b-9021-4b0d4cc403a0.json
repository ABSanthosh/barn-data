  "text": "mad architects’ never hut reimagines childhood nostalgiaMAD Architects introduces The Never Hut, a playful installation at the Guangdong Nanhai Land Art Festival 2024 in Yanqiao Village, China. Conceived as a celebration of childhood wonder and community connection, the centerpiece of the festival reimagines a historic playground as a vibrant gathering space. ‘This project is about capturing the freedom and wonder of childhood while providing a space for the community to gather, reflect, and imagine what lies ahead,’ shares Ma Yansong, founder of MAD Architects.The distinctive flying saucer-like form of the structure hovers on three tentacle-shaped supports crafted from repurposed fishing nets. Gently swaying in the breeze, the installation creates a kinetic interaction with its natural and cultural surroundings. Building on MAD’s prior work in Nanhai District, including the Timeless Beacon at Taiping Market (find designboom’s previous coverage here) The Never Hut highlights the commitment of the studio to combining art, architecture, and local heritage. all images by Tian Fangfang, courtesy of MAD Architects, unless stated otherwisethe installation is set within a 600-year-old chinese villageSet within a 600-year-old village steeped in history, Beijing-based MAD Architects’ installation draws inspiration from Yanqiao’s Qing Dynasty-era architecture, meandering river systems, and the towering banyan tree at its entrance. Once the site of an elementary school playground, the location holds deep significance for the local community. By transforming this cherished space, Ma Yansong’s firm pays tribute to collective childhood memories while offering a vibrant stage for interactions and experiences. The bold and colorful palette of the canopy contrasts with the muted tones of the village, providing a shaded circular refuge for rest, reflection, and connection. The Never Hut is open to the public as part of the Guangdong Nanhai Land Art Festival 2024, welcoming villagers and visitors alike.the colorful palette of the canopy contrasts with the muted tones of the village | image by Zhu Yumengthe flying saucer-like form of the structure hovers on three tentacle-shaped supports | image by Zhu Yumengconceived as a celebration of childhood wonder and community connection | image by Zhu Yumengthe installation reimagines a historic playground as a vibrant gathering space | image by Zhu Yumeng",
