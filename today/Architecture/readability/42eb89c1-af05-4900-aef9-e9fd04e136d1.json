  "text": "The Final Entry Deadline for Architizer's 2025 A+Product Awards is Friday, January 24. Get your brand in front of the AEC industry’s most renowned designers by submitting today. The most exciting interiors are the ones that speak to us. Not literally, of course — although who wouldn’t want a floor lamp with some spicy opinions — but in the way they resonate with us. We’re talking about the kind of spaces that spark conversation, encourage engagement and leave a lasting impression. They go way beyond ‘nice’ and they more than meet the metric of ‘functional’. What they are is often different to different people, but always they challenge, delight and, above all, make us think. Artful interiors are about emotions. They’re spaces where the items within, be it a Tiffany lampshade or a Nakashima dining table, are part of a larger story, one that is written with the intent to make you feel. They celebrate uniqueness, not just in the end result but throughout the design process itself. They are the result of opportunities seized by designers to take risks, play with form and colour, and ultimately bring their uninhibited ideas to life. The following products, winners of this year’s Architizer A+Product Awards, do just that, aiding the creative freedom that great designers demand. They provide the means to take risks, explore new ideas and challenge conventional thinking about interiors. Each is impeccably designed and manufactured for an industry that sees space as an opportunity to experiment and innovate, becoming part of the conversation to create environments that inspire. Casper Collection By LightArt Popular Choice Winner, Decorative \u0026 Free Standing Lighting, 2024 A+Product Awards Think of light not as a passive fixture but as a sculptural medium that can transform entire spaces. LightArt’s Casper Collection embodies this view, offering sleek, white lights that provide even illumination on all four sides. Reimagined from the inside out — LEDs, drivers, lensing and housing have all been re-engineered — Casper now achieves a 30% weight reduction and boasts a lifespan well beyond its 70k-hour rating. Designers can form continuous linear runs or intricate geometries, specifying tunable white or RGB options to craft atmospheric gradients or vibrant statements. Minimal glare, subtle uplighting, and flexible hang points ensure these fixtures are way more exciting than the usual overhead glow. BuzziCee + BuzziPlanter By BuzziSpace Jury Winner, Contract Seating, 2024 A+Product Awards Well-being, connectivity and sustainability often set the tone for modern spaces in today’s world. To that end, BuzziCee and BuzziPlanter offer designers a chance to create a holistic interior experience. BuzziCee’s acoustic seating employs recycled materials and ergonomic form to absorb ambient noise, creating comfortable pockets of calm. Alongside it, BuzziPlanter integrates lush greenery into the design, celebrating biophilia with eco-conscious construction. Together, they blend aesthetics, acoustics and nature into adaptable zones that bring human-centered values into offices, lounges, or social hubs. These pieces allow designers to use furniture not just as a functional backdrop but as an active, life-giving element of their interiors. Seem 1 Acoustic Louver By Focal Point Jury Winner, Lighting, Recessed \u0026 Mounted Lighting, 2024 A+Product Awards When ceilings take on a more valuable role, like illumination and acoustics, innovation emerges. Focal Point’s Seem 1 Acoustic Louver integrates ID+ technology into PET felt baffles, delivering deep regress louver cells that precisely channel light in broad or focused beams — all while softening sound overhead. Designers can choose bidirectional illumination, pairing direct and indirect light to shape mood and function, and mix louver finishes with a rainbow of felt colors for an elegant and customized aesthetic. By turning technical nuance — cutoff angles, beam spreads, acoustic absorption — into a palette of creative choices, Seem 1 allows designers to compose environments that engage the senses, encourage interaction, and embrace expressive risk-taking. Arborisa By Arktura Jury Winner, Finishes, Acoustic, 2024 A+Product Awards Not every acoustic solution need be linear and subdued. With Arborisa, Arktura looked to tree canopies for inspiration, conjuring large-scale, cable-hung “clouds” of PET-felt baffles that mimic the organic complexity of branches. Each of the four modules — Nest, Axil, Aura, Denza — is unique and channels natural motifs into angular lines and layered silhouettes. Specifiable in wood-inspired finishes or duo-tone Soft Sound® textures, Arborisa is ideal for designers looking to break away from standard acoustical treatments.  Ova By Matthew McCormick Studio Popular Choice Winner, Pendant Lighting, 2024 A+Product Awards Ova captures the grace of molten glass and transforms it into a modular, artisan-crafted pendant light. Over a year of experimentation refined every detail—from the spacing between glass layers to the delicate inner “spine” that masks the LED source, resulting in a luminous form that radiates warmth. Available in clear or frosted outer shells, Ova’s diffuser creates a soft glow that shifts as you move around it, breathing life into static spaces. Rather than settling for conventional lighting, Ova nudges designers to treat illumination as an art form, urging them to shape environments that wow visitors. TRIBA By AQForm Jury Winner, Decorative \u0026 Free Standing Lighting, 2024 A+Product Awards Some products prove that precision and versatility can be expressive and ornamental. TRIBA is one such light fitting. Hybrid optics, varied diameters, and multiple mounting strategies come together in a design that ensures visual comfort without sacrificing performance. Offered in LED or replaceable light source formats, TRIBA suits a host of project types, from liner suspension in residential corridors to grouped layering in commercial displays. TRIBA adapts effortlessly to scale and need. Edge By Sige Spa Jury Winner, Best of the Year, Residential Design, 2024 A+Product Awards Organization can be elegant without being fussy, and Edge proves just that. A modular wardrobe system, Edge relies on telescopic elements, soft-close runners, rubber profiles, and carefully chosen materials that dampen noise and protect garments. Enhanced by a semi-glossy warm grey finish that subtly catches the light, Edge provides functional order while maintaining a refined, contemporary look. Admix Tables By Allsteel Popular Choice Winner, Contract Furniture, 2024 A+Product Awards Furniture should invite agility and Admix Tables provide a spectrum of reconfigurable options — telescoping legs, wheelbarrow features, casters, and glides — that respond to evolving team sizes, collaborative modes and technological demands. Their open design supports integrated wire management and accessory trays, bag hooks and footrests. Rather than imposing rigid hierarchies, Admix empowers designers to craft spaces where functionality, user experience and adaptability shine. Futurismo Collection By GRAFF Jury Winner, Fixtures \u0026 Fittings – Kitchen, 2024 A+Product Awards. Paying homage to architectural Futurism, Futurismo borrows from a movement known for its embrace of modernity, dynamic lines, and innovative use of materials and layers those principles into a beautiful faucet collection. Futurismo caters to diverse needs—bar faucets, pot fillers, independent side sprays—expanding its use across commercial and residential applications. Each piece’s architectural form and advanced finish options (like Gunmetal or Polished Gold PVD) speak to designers who wish to turn a kitchen or bathroom fixture into a focal point, reaffirming that even the most common elements can carry forward vision and innovation Obi By Expormim Jury Winner, Outdoor Furniture, 2024 A+Product Awards Why should outdoor seating have the dull predictability of a plastic chair? Obi challenges that notion by taking inspiration from the kimono’s belt (obi), introducing an elastic band that wraps the sofa’s backrest cushions in a contrasting material. Backed by an aluminum injection-molded frame and extruded profiles that are 100% recyclable, Obi combines cultural storytelling with ergonomic design. It’s comfortable, weather-resistant and visually intriguing — a mix that encourages designers to blur boundaries between indoor refinement and outdoor resilience. In this, Obi demonstrates that authenticity can elevate even the most functional furnishings. Memory Components By Siqueira+Azul Popular Choice Winner, Residential Furniture, 2024 A+Product Awards Not all storage has to fade into the background. Memory Components is a collection of small timber side furniture that transforms and can be configured into multiple setups. Drawers of varying sizes, swiveling trays, and open compartments allow designers to tailor functionality, while visible joint details highlight the craftsmanship of the natural wood. Positioned side by side, these pieces form a stunning continuous sideboard. Designers who favor simplicity, honesty and sophistication will find in Memory Components a beautiful, eye-catching and adaptable piece of feature furniture. Arktura x Pure+FreeForm Collaboration – Wall Panels By Arktura Popular Choice Winner, Walls \u0026 Wall Coverings, 2024 A+Product Awards Walls need not be silent, static surfaces. With Arktura’s perforated panel systems and Pure+FreeForm’s premium metal finishes — ranging from Hollywood and Parisian Rust to refined wood grains — interior surfaces can be used to tell stories of pattern and texture. Over 30 style options in Vapor®, Trace®, and other lines let designers customize modules that balance aesthetic flexibility with technical precision. Whether embracing metallic patinas or naturalistic hues, this collaboration encourages professionals to expand their design vocabulary, step out of their comfort zone and adopt something new and expressive. REGUPOL Upscale By Regupol Popular Choice Winner, Flooring, 2024 A+Product Awards. Footwear, footsteps and the thrum of daily activity shape how we experience a space from the ground up. REGUPOL Upscale’s Luxury Rubber Tile (LRT) and Plank (LRP) harness recycled tire rubber and EPDM chips to create a flooring solution that balances comfort, slip resistance, acoustic control and easy maintenance. With various sizes, colors and edge profiles, Upscale adapts to education, corporate, retail, hospitality and healthcare environments. Its dense, customizable patterns minimize visible wear, while sustainable sourcing ensures an ethical footprint. Upscale exemplifies how floor design can be both earth-conscious and design-forward, enabling creators to explore color and pattern with ease. Seyun Collection By Zaha Hadid Design Jury Winner, Residential Furniture, 2024 A+Product Awards Heritage, craftsmanship and advanced fabrication are the basis of the ambitious Seyun Collection, which extends Zaha Hadid Design’s architectural language into elegant furniture. Chairs, armchairs, barstools and tables use sustainably sourced wood, machine precision and hand finishing to reveal striking grain patterns and powerful asymmetries. Modular dimensions allow tables to unite into unique configurations, their corner details forming interlocking, organic geometries. In Seyun, the fusion of material honesty, digital tooling, and artisanal care is evident and stands as an example of the continuous innovation, bold decisions and the willingness to explore complexity and beauty that both Zaha Hadid Design and leading furniture manufacturer Karimoku are known for. The Final Entry Deadline for Architizer's 2025 A+Product Awards is Friday, January 24. Get your brand in front of the AEC industry’s most renowned designers by submitting today.",

Specifiable in wood-inspired finishes or duo-tone Soft Sound® textures, Arborisa is ideal for designers looking to break away from standard acoustical treatments. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr/\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://architizer.com/brands/matthew-mccormick-studio/products/ova/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOva\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBy \u003ca href=\"https://architizer.com/brands/matthew-mccormick-studio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eMatthew McCormick Studio\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePopular Choice Winner, Pendant Lighting, 2024 A+Product Awards\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/Matthew-McCormick_Ova-C33_CLEAR_Hotel-Lobby_02-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"2560\" srcset=\"https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/Matthew-McCormick_Ova-C33_CLEAR_Hotel-Lobby_02-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/Matthew-McCormick_Ova-C33_CLEAR_Hotel-Lobby_02-300x300.jpg 300w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/Matthew-McCormick_Ova-C33_CLEAR_Hotel-Lobby_02-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/Matthew-McCormick_Ova-C33_CLEAR_Hotel-Lobby_02-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/Matthew-McCormick_Ova-C33_CLEAR_Hotel-Lobby_02-768x768.jpg 768w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/Matthew-McCormick_Ova-C33_CLEAR_Hotel-Lobby_02-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/Matthew-McCormick_Ova-C33_CLEAR_Hotel-Lobby_02-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"/\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOva captures the grace of molten glass and transforms it into a modular, artisan-crafted pendant light.
