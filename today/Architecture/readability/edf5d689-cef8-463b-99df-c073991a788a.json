  "text": "The recent total loss of Eric Owen Moss' 708 House design from 1982 in the Pacific Palisades Fire has been documented by the Los Angeles Conservancy and its current owner Ed Massey, who told The Hollywood Reporter, \"It was serene and beautiful all in one.\" Image courtesy Eric Owen Moss ArchitectsImage courtesy Eric Owen Moss ArchitectsMoss shared the following words with Archinect in response to the devastating loss: How the recent Palisades fire affects the story of the 708 house story isn’t clear to me.  Possibly the fire itself, for all its devastation, ratifies a quality in the building — its temporality? Unclear that I can recapture the essence of going forward back when it was designed, while reflecting backward on its recent burning.  The 708 house was a series of tentative conceptual gestures, a series of space/form/shape and surface experiments,  a kind of illiteracy looking for a language.   I think I can say I’m still looking, so the 708 probably says that the road remained better than the inn, or at least the inn remained elusive. Search unrequited? It looks somewhat crude now, perhaps clumsy, and maybe those were obligatory design steps. The house belongs to a period in the middle ’70s through the early 80s that included the Morgenstern Warehouse, the Fun House, the Pinball House, ending with the Petal House. In simple, clinical terms it raised the issue of the instability of formal definitions.  It raised the issue of the interrelationship of new to old, or existing to new.   What’s an architecture language? Who says so? Why?  Does the project confirm an a priori series of form, material, and organizational priorities we recognize, or should its task be to interrogate, and suggest possible alternatives, no less ephemeral? What’s a wall, a floor, a door, a window? Curiosity? Wonder? I think those were the ingredients. Aspirationally 708 could continue to stand for that.Designed during a formative period in Moss’ career, the 708 House extended a modest 1948 Case Study-style home with an unconventional second story and a series of fragmented, layered elements that challenged architectural norms. Flying buttresses, a perforated façade, and an oversized false-front gable played with formal instability, an ongoing theme in Moss’ work. Its address, “708,” was embedded into the structure itself, its digits forming part of the building’s small windows.",
