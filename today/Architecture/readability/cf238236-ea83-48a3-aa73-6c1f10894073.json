Olin McKenzie Design Partner at Skidmore, Owings \u0026 Merrill (SOM) As a designer, Olin McKenzie is influenced by his experience of cities — the spaces, patterns, and buildings that contribute to the novelty and wonder of urban living. His architectural sensibility is invested in restraint and clarity, and by the belief that layered work can be most powerfully achieved through an economy of design moves. When he joined SOM in 2006, Olin initially worked in the education sector, with projects including the Raffles American School in Iskandar, Malaysia, and student activity and athletic facilities for Kuwait University. He went on to design dynamic and influential transportation projects, including Brightline, which encompasses three passenger rail stations in South Florida, and the Philadelphia 30th Street Station District Plan. A human scale and distinct visual identity are throughlines in Olin’s work. From the curving glass façade which masks the structural columns at Pendry Manhattan West to the locally sourced timber screens that enable passive shading and air flow at the Raffles American School, Olin is known for finding unexpected formal and material solutions that enrich a building’s function and surroundings.

James Biber Founder/Principal of Biber Architects James Biber, an architect and author, was a partner in the New York office of Pentagram for nearly 20 years before founding Biber Architects.
