  "text": "If frying eggs or bacon is a regular part of your morning ritual, take note. Soon, your ability to use nonstick cookware may come down to where you live. New York state lawmakers recently introduced a bill that would prohibit “the manufacture, sale, and use” of cookware containing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the primary substance used to create a nonstick surface. Though the chemical compound, commonly known by the brand name Teflon, is approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration, New York has now joined a growing list of states that are proposing to ban—or in some cases, have already banned—nonstick cookware in their territories.Is New York banning nonstick cookware?In January of this year, two New York State senators introduced Senate Bill S1767, which if passed, “prohibits the manufacture, sale, and use of cookware containing polytetrafluoroethylene.” In the bill’s justification, the sponsors write that the chemicals used in nonstick pans are “within the family of polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) which are known to have severe health effects such as harm to reproductive and bodily functions, developmental effects in youth, increased cancer risk and increased risk for high cholesterol and obesity.” It acknowledges that additional research is needed to determine the full scope of risk, but “we should not leave people vulnerable to the potential negative health effects,” it concludes.The bill is currently in Senate committee, meaning it hasn’t been brought to the floor for voting by the whole legislative body. Once on the floor, it needs to be approved by both the New York State Senate and Assembly, then signed into law by the governor.Are nonstick pans safe?Your favorite pan now comes in a sturdier versionThere is little debate about the safety risk of nonstick pans that do not use Teflon coating, for example ceramic or cast-iron pans. However, those that do use PTFE have raised concerns in recent years. “PTFE belongs to a subgroup of what is known as PFAS,” explains Bruce Jarnot, PhD, global materials compliance expert, toxicologist, and product compliance advisor at Assent. PFAS are often colloquially called “forever chemicals,” because they don’t degrade over time, and the human body cannot metabolize them.In some instances, this can come in handy. PFAS are used to insulate leads in a pacemaker or used in hip joint replacements since they are inert. “In these instances, it’s fine, it’s inert,” Jarnot says. “But there are other considerations to take into account when considering potential laws like New York State Senate Bill 1767.”Nonstick pans are commonplace in many households. Photo: Valentyna Yeltsova/Getty ImagesThe first, he says, is the environmental waste and pollution that manufacturers of products containing PFAS make. “We all have the monomers—the building blocks of polymers like Teflon—inside us from the manufacturing phase,” Jarnot says, adding that the waste ends up in water and soil, which eventually makes its way to the humans. “So there’s a strong argument against PFAS in general. Because they stay put in the body, and they can accumulate over time when they’re in our environment.”In cookware specifically, that potential risk increases because the products are used with high heats. “That’s probably the highest heat environment that a material like Teflon is exposed to. So when you have a pacemaker implanted, it’s at body temperature. If you’re searing fish or steak in a fry pan, it’s being exposed to much higher heat,” he says. Chemical reactions occur faster in hot environments, and, “You could have decomposition of the polymer giving rise to some really nasty airborne PFAS. And there is probably some internalization of these decomposing products at high temperature.”What happens when PFAS accumulate in the body?According to the the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), exposure to PFAS could be harmful to human health. “Scientists at EPA, in other federal agencies, and in academia and industry are continuing to conduct and review the growing body of research about PFAS. However, health effects associated with exposure to PFAS are difficult to specify for many reasons,” the agency says. For that reason, more research is required to determine the exact risks.As Jarnot explains, toxicologists often say that it’s the dose that makes the poison. “So here you have something that’s not metabolizing and that is accumulating in your body, creating aggregate exposure. In that case, every bit you add to your exposure cup counts.”Both cast-iron and ceramic pans are popular alternatives to PTFE-coated pans. Photo: Rebeca Mello/Getty ImagesShould consumers throw out nonstick pans?Even in states where nonstick pans are legal, some consumers may consider discarding theirs because of potential risk. “As a toxicologist, I still use Teflon pans,” Jarnot admits. “But you should never heat them without something in it, and should avoid very high heat.”That said, eliminating nonstick pans could be an easy way to minimize exposure to PFAS. “You’re getting exposure in almost all drinks—water, wine, beer, soda—because it’s in the water these drinks are made from. But you need water, you need food. So one of the places you could easily omit exposure is in cookware,” Jarnot adds.What other states have banned nonstick pans?Multiple states have passed or are considering legislation about polytetrafluoroethylene in their territories. California, for example, passed a law that states cookware with intentionally added PFAS must be disclosed on product labels; however, it hasn’t passed a full ban. Others, like Connecticut, Maine, Vermont, and Rhode Island have passed laws that go into effect over the next few years and ban products with intentionally added PFAS. Minnesota passed a law banning PFAS in a number of consumer goods, including cookware, which went into effect in January of this year.",
