The project, situated south of the Lu Xun Memorial Museum, transforms a previously fenced-off, underutilized woodland into an accessible urban space. The redesign relocates existing trees to create pathways, soft boundaries, and an open gathering area that uses architectural and landscape elements to bring out the public nature of the site. The Breeze Hall features a wing-like roof supported by slender steel columns, creating a 42-meter-long, 15-meter-wide, and 12-meter-high open space suitable for events, exhibitions, and gatherings. Prefabricated perforated roof panels, assembled on-site, filter light and air, resulting in a semi-transparent structure. Low eaves shield the hall from the bustling commercial street, focusing attention on the surrounding natural landscape of trees, bamboo, and water features.all images by Lv Xiaobin, courtesy of SHISUO Design Office, unless stated otherwiseBreeze Hall as a landmark in harmony with its verdant contextSituated south of the Lu Xun Memorial Museum, the site was previously enclosed and unused. Shanghai-based SHISUO Design Office reorganized the area by transplanting trees to create a walkway that frames the museum and forms a soft boundary for the new building. The architects locate additional trees on the flanks of the site, enclosing a large open space and preserving existing tall trees and bamboo, integrating new pathways.The team addresses two key challenges in the Breeze Hall project: creating a high-quality structure within a limited budget and timeframe while establishing a landmark building in harmony with the urban context of the park. The base of the pavilion transitions into steps, benches, a bridge, and a waterside platform as it intersects with the inclines of the site. A pool at the base reflects its surroundings, with rainwater collected for reuse. The low eaves mitigate noise from nearby commercial streets, creating a serene atmosphere within the hall.SHISUO Design Office unveils Breeze Hall | image by Zhu Runzithe interior of the structure resembles a silent monumentInside Breeze Hall, the base rises to form an abstract structure, resembling a silent monument, with a canyon-like staircase leading to elevated platforms that frame moments of the park through narrow windows. This interplay of light and shadow emphasizes the connection between the sacred and the everyday. Attention to detail shapes the tactile and sensory experience of the building. Beige plaster finishes provide a soft, skin-like texture, and handrails with arched profiles encourage visitors to linger. Double-layer perforated panels create a microclimate enhanced by the evaporation from the pool. During construction, the team adapted the design to accommodate wildlife, ensuring the pool remains a water source for birds, lizards, and other animals, further integrating the building into its natural environment.this multifunctional public space is located within Shanghai’s most significant memorial park | image by Zhu Runzitransforming a previously underutilized woodland into an accessible urban space | image by Sanifthe redesign relocates existing trees to create pathways and an open gathering area | image by Lv Xiaobin",
