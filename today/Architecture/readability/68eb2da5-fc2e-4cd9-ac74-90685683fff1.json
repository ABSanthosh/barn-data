  "text": "In an episode from Tiny House Giant Journey, a YouTube channel dedicated to unique home tours, host Jenna visits the Black Crane Treehouse, a striking, mid century-inspired retreat perched in the treetops above Mission Lake in Washington State. Designed as an artist residency, this small but highly intentional space blends architecture, craftsmanship, and nature into one unforgettable experience. The treehouse is supported by two 100-year-old trees and a central structural tower. Specially engineered bolts allow the trees to sway while keeping the house stable. Though small in footprint, it took ten months to complete and is designed to last 80 years, adjusting with the trees as they grow. The exterior channels mid century style with clean lines, skylights, and covered porches that frame views of the Olympic Mountains. Inside, the sleeping area centers around a king-sized bed placed directly beneath the treehouse’s largest skylight. From here, guests can look up into the tree canopy, an experience meant to soothe and reconnect. The plywood interior creates a warm, tree-like atmosphere that feels enclosed yet light-filled. The bathroom features an open-plan rain shower under a skylight, heated floors, and a high-tech bidet toilet. The materials balance smooth, modern finishes with bold, textured elements, creating contrast and warmth. The open layout avoids clutter and enhances the natural feel of the space. What began as a potential lounge area evolved into a large dining nook with a built-in banquette and table for up to twelve guests. Designed on the fly during construction, the space now anchors communal meals and gatherings, maximizing function in a small footprint. The compact kitchen is outfitted with custom cabinetry, deep sinks, and handcrafted ceramics made on-site. Every piece, from mugs to plates, was designed to match the house’s black-and-wood palette. The dish rack doubles as storage, and the under-counter fridge keeps the space feeling open and usable. The Black Crane Treehouse is a space built for creativity, reflection, and connection. With its thoughtful layout, handcrafted details, and immersive setting, it invites guests to slow down and reconnect with themselves, nature, and their work. Watch the full video tour below from Tiny House Giant Journey.",
