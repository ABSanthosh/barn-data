  "text": "Chris Evans is letting go of his longtime Los Angeles mansion. The actor, known for his role as Captain America in the Marvel cinematic universe, is offloading the property for a hair under $7 million. Evans purchased the Mulholland Canyon estate for $3.5 million in 2013. Though the 1940s property retains much of its original charm, the Avengers star personalized the pad with contemporary upgrades in collaboration with the LA-based design firm Stewart-Gulrajani.The four-bedroom abode is located on a 4,600-square-foot lot in the Hollywood Hills, a celeb enclave where Keanu Reeves, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Ariana Grande also reside. The plot sits atop the canyon and offers sweeping panoramic views of the Santa Monica Mountains and Mulholland and Laurel Canyons. Sky-high ceilings and exposed beams are featured throughout the home. The formal living and dining rooms are outfitted with fireplaces, a wet bar, and large windows that bathe the space in natural light.The home’s kitchen. Photo: Noel KleinmanThe sky-lit gourmet kitchen features luxury appliances including a Wolf range, a Sub-Zero fridge, and marble countertops. The home’s secluded primary suite offers a private deck. Other highlights of the main bedroom include a walk-in dressing room and a spa-like bathroom, complete with a steam shower and a soaking tub. Each bedroom extends outdoors to a terrace, with access to the garden, a pool, and other outdoor amenities, including a fire pit. In a press release, the actor says he worked to “enhance the beauty of the view and make the yard into an entertainer’s paradise.” An additional guest unit is attached to the house and is fully equipped with a kitchen, office, gym, and jaw-dropping vistas to comfortably accommodate visitors. The actor transformed the space into a private gym, where he trained for his role as Captain America in the Marvel films.The home’s gym. Photo: Noel KleinmanA bedroom in the home.
