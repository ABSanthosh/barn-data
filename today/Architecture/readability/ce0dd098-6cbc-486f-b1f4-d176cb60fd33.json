  "text": "Mosca Bianca Integrates Craft Process into Interior designThe Mosca Bianca project by AACM – Atelier Architettura Chinello Morandi is a ceramic workshop that also functions as an exhibition space in Padua, Italy. The design concept integrates the entire process of terracotta crafting into the spatial and material composition of the interior. The primary design gesture takes the form of a continuous, sculptural element that extends from the ceiling and guides the spatial experience. Shaped to evoke the twisting movement of clay on a potter’s wheel, this form creates a centripetal dynamic within the space, drawing attention toward a single zenithal light source. This lighting element punctuates the central axis, aligning with a monolithic work and display table positioned diagonally within the room.The table serves multiple functions. While it operates as an exhibition platform when closed, it transforms into a worktable during ceramic workshops. Its structure reveals a series of concealed chairs and storage compartments integrated into the volume. Constructed from okumé wood sheets and supported by T-shaped frames, the table features a slender, cantilevered design that visually reduces its mass and emphasizes lightness. The choice of surface material responds to functional requirements for clay workability.table without chairs | all images by CatalogoSpatial Design by AACM is Rooted in Material LifecycleThe surrounding surfaces contribute to the narrative of the ceramic-making process. Walls and ceilings are finished with a rammed-earth plaster composed of clay and brick production waste. This material selection reflects a focus on reuse and closed material cycles, consistent with the lifecycle of terracotta. Storage for tools and workshop equipment is integrated discreetly behind metal blades and fabric curtains, maintaining a clear spatial language and allowing functional elements to appear only as needed during use.Throughout the project by studio AACM – Atelier Architettura Chinello Morandi, the relationship between form, material, and function remains central. The spatial layout, material palette, and lighting strategy collectively reference the phases of terracotta production, from raw material, through shaping and working, to final display.table closed altarworktablediagonal table closeddiagonal table opentable light curtain",
