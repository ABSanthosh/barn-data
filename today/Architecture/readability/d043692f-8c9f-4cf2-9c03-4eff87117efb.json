  "text": "Actor Will Arnett is letting go of his customized Beverly Hills house, the Wall Street Journal reports. The Bojack Horseman star has listed the 10,300-square-foot contemporary dwelling for $22.5 million. His listing agent told the outlet that the bicoastal actor is selling because he has been spending more time in New York.Arnett, who co-hosts the popular SmartLess podcast alongside his Arrested Development co-star Jason Bateman and Will \u0026 Grace star Sean Hayes, had a professional sound booth installed on the half-acre parcel to record voiceovers and podcasts from the comfort of his home. He was the first resident of the new build when he bought it for $16.4 million in 2021. He then spent millions more tweaking it to his liking; in addition to the sound booth, the Toronto native revamped the backyard, added built-ins, and switched out the lighting, plumbing fixtures, and hardware.A black pivot-entry front door opens into the home’s double-height foyer, which features a sculptural floating staircase leading up to the bedroom level. The primary suite comes equipped with a modern fireplace and a luxurious bathroom with vaulted ceilings, treetop views, a massive glass-walled shower for two, and a soaking tub. The upper level also features a balcony overlooking the home’s resort-like backyard, which boasts a cold plunge, meditation area, sauna, and a vegetable garden—in addition to the typical outdoor amenities of an eight-figure Beverly Hills listing, including a swimming pool, a barbecue area, and an alfresco dining setup. More entertaining spots can be found on the pad’s lower level, which hosts a game room, a gym, and an especially cozy-looking film screening spot with tiered seating, wood paneling, and extra-deep sofas.Join NowBecome an AD PRO member for only $25 $20 per month + receive an exclusive toteArrowArnett apparently has a thing for bespoke homes.
