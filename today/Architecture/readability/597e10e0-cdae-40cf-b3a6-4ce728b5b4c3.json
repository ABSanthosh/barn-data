Ortiz ArchitectureA Fusion of Tropical and Japanese DesignWith the design of the Dominican Republic Residence, studio Victor B. Ortiz Architecture employs a carefully curated selection of materials, including wood, concrete, metal, and glass, for an aesthetic that is at once sophisticated and approachable. The interiors are furnished with pieces custom-designed by the architect himself, complemented by iconic Brazilian furniture by designers such as Sergio Rodrigo and Jader Almeida. Ortiz’s signature tropical style is infused with elements of Japanese design, per the client’s request. Full-height windows and expansive terraces create a fluid transition between indoor and outdoor spaces, inviting the surrounding plant-life into the home. The result is a serene and airy interior environment that balances contemporary design with natural greenery.Victor Ortiz designs a tropical-Japanese inspired residence in Santiagomaterials include wood, concrete, metal, and glass for a modern aestheticthe home spans 1,800 square meters indoors and 2,000 square meters outdoorsfurniture combines custom pieces with works by Brazilian designers Sergio Rodrigo and Jader Almeida",
