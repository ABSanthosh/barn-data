However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Architect Kristin Luks remembers feeling surprised the first time she stepped into this apartment in order to get to work for her clients. She came off a tree-lined street on New York’s Upper West Side and into a building that’s stood for nearly a century, eventually making her way to a one-bedroom apartment that measured about 1,000 square feet—rare outdoor space included.Sure, New York City is known for its architectural charms, but to see so many appear in one enduring address was exciting. “The 10-foot-tall ceilings coupled with tall northern-facing windows were just breathtaking. And the two terraces, a functioning fireplace, and a sunroom really wowed me,” Luks says. “The owners were able to check so many items off their wishlist when they purchased this apartment.”Aline Sullivan and William Pitt, who own a financial services research and communications consulting firm and have adult children, had joined a small list of fellow optimists when they claimed this home for themselves. Previous occupants had likely started their share of projects with the thrill of impending improvement, but once Luks came around at the end of 2022, their past work had only resulted in too much of a blank slate. “All but two of the original details had been stripped from the apartment after years of different owners and renovations,” Luks says. “Thankfully we had no issue salvaging both items: existing windows in the living room and kitchen that open out into the sunroom. They are single-glazed but so charming, and because they open into a conditioned space, we didn’t have to worry about efficiency and heat loss.”Luks and the couple wanted to reinstate some of the details that were discarded, tying the apartment more clearly to its history without being too beholden to it. The big surprise Luks wanted to pull off was figuring out when and where to update the classics. She worked with Interior Masters Group to replace vinyl planks with herringbone wood floors, and swapped the fireplace’s oversized wood surround for a reclaimed stone mantle. New wood casings made to resemble ones of the 1920s were put in around the windows, and existing cove plaster was kept and mimicked on the walls.A Noguchi ceiling light hangs above a vintage coffee table, stool, and chair from Somerset House. “I like to keep the colors and textures of our designs aligned to the style of the buildings they’re in,” Luks says. “I want my clients to never have to renovate, so I prefer timeless finishes over trends that can date quickly.” “It’s common as a New York City architect to make sweeping changes that can modify existing layouts for the better,” she says. “While we did that in small ways, we spent a lot of time thinking about this apartment in sections. With such a small footprint, we had to get creative about how we layered things on top of one another.” The kitchen and bathroom were reconfigured for this era, and the grandfathered-in sunroom was entirely renovated so that it could flex as a dining room, office, and guest bedroom. “We hung three of the four air handlers for central air from the existing ceiling structure in the living room, and then concealed them in dropped ceilings. The fourth one is actually concealed above the bookcases in the living room and closets in the bedroom. And that bookcase also conceals a wine fridge.”Luks says that carrying out these changes was like solving a Rubik’s cube instead of a jigsaw puzzle, but she enjoyed the challenge. And besides, it’s fun when everyone enjoys the same warm-yet-neutral palette. “This is probably my dream kitchen in terms of color and finishes,” she says. “We chose the paint color together, which is Farrow \u0026 Ball’s Skylight, and then I ran with the millwork and layout.”After about two years of working as a team, Luks left the apartment to Sullivan and Pitt at the start of 2024. She had spent years researching the history of century-old homes, learning how to honor them. And she committed herself to finding just the right materials to meet present expectations—it took visiting five different outfitters to find that exact “Stilton cheese” kitchen countertop the owners requested. Luks wasn’t surprised by how dedicated she was to this place. Perhaps she was just returning the favor.“It’s very important to me to create a connection between any project I’m working on and the surrounding area,” Luks says. “Infusing the home with a sense of history has made it feel grounded and period appropriate.”“The sunroom is one of those wild things you come across every so often as an architect working in the city—something that was built years ago and was grandfathered in,” Luks says. “Meaning, it’s fully legal but I’d never be allowed to build it now.” Ann Sacks floor tiles and Allied Maker sconces surround a vintage dining table and custom benches built by Charles Shackleton. The daybed is by Caravane.Waterworks supplied the stone tiles and fixtures, while the shower curtain was sourced from Crate \u0026 Barrel. “The toilet used to be under the window, with the tub and sink along the right side of the room,” Luks says. “The tile patterns we chose are also typical of a pre-war bath but done in a more luxurious marble.”",
