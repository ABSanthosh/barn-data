  "text": "kooo architects completes hotel rakuraguA nine-story building built on a narrow site of 84 square meters, Kooo Architects’ Hotel Rakuragu takes constraints in a positive light and sublimates them into design. Located in Tokyo’s central district, the hotel focuses on the ‘gaps’ within the urban fabric to maximize natural ventilation, light, and diverse urban views within the dense cityscape through a rhythmic geometric facade punctuated by cut-out terraces.These irregular voids in the white cuboid lend each room a balcony with a unique view, with integrated passive design principles to balance openness with thermal comfort. This decision mitigates summer heat and improves winter heating efficiency — a critical consideration during the Covid-19 pandemic design phase.all images courtesy of Kooo Architectsthe geometric volume is defined by cut-out terracesSurrounded by mixed-use buildings of varying heights, materials, and styles, the site lacked scenic vistas or uniformity in its urban context. While typical Tokyo hotels omit balconies to maximize interior room space, Kooo Architects took a different approach, observing the surrounding buildings and orienting each floor’s openings toward urban gaps, creating balconies in varying directions. Wrapping around Hotel Rakuragu, some balconies are triangular, while others span the entire bay.
