Computational Design Young Voices AwardRegistration/Submission Deadline: Friday, May 9, 2025\"The Computational Design Young Voices Award (née Leland Jobson Prize) recognizes architecture students who have created a project demonstrating strong technological ingenuity, celebrating them with the hope that it emboldens them to continue on the path to computational design as well as inspiring others to do the same.\" Madang Project Design Competition for the Korean Museum of Urbanism and ArchitectureRegistration Deadline: Thursday, May 15, 2025Submission Deadline: Monday, May 19, 2025\"XORBIS Inc., one of the consortium currently undertaking the exhibition design, production, and installation for the opening exhibition of the KMUA, is hosting this design competition under the overarching theme of 'The Natural \u0026 the Artificial in the Museum.' The northern courtyard is designated under the sub-theme 'Rest,' while the southern courtyard is associated with 'Play.' Through this competition, the intent is to define the characteristics and functions of each courtyard—positioned respectively at the core of the exhibition space (north) and the workshop studio \u0026 fabrication lab (south)—and to derive the most suitable design proposal that harmonizes natural and artificial elements.\" University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Campus Instructional Facility by Skidmore, Owings \u0026 Merrill was a People's Choice Award Winner in the 2023 AIA Chicago Architecture Awards.
