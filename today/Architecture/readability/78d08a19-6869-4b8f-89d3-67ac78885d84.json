  "text": "anchor Image: Sebastian Stephan Thiel/Flickr (CC BY 2.0) An alarming new study produced by the University of Miami has shown 35 buildings to be sinking at depths of up to 8 centimeters (3.1 inches). They are all located in between Miami Beach and its northernmost Sunny Isles Beach neighbor. The subsidence has gone on since at least 2016 and affected multiple structures in the vicinity of the former Champlain Towers South in Surfside, where nearly 100 people were killed tragically in a 2021 building collapse. Roughly half of those documented by the survey were constructed after 2014, according to its authors. (h/t NBC 6 South Florida).",
