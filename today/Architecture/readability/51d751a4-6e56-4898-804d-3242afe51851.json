  "text": "A career path to architecture unfolded for Elizabeth Graziolo when she was accepted into the architecture program at Cooper Union in New York City. At the time, she wasn’t sure what she wanted to do, yet within a few months at the storied institution her course was set. “After my first semester everything clicked,” Graziolo says. “I started seeing the world differently, from new perspectives, and I completely loved it.” After graduation she joined the team at Cicognani Kalla, where Ann Kalla was an early and influential mentor. Kalla helped shape Graziolo’s understanding as she moved from theory to real-world design. As she honed her skills, Kalla’s guidance also prepared her for what women experience in the profession. Graziolo spent nearly two decades at Peter Pennoyer Architects, where she worked on a wide range of projects, from townhouse reconstructions to residential developments. Ready for her next challenge, she decided to venture out on her own and founded Yellow House Architects in 2020. Elizabeth Graziolo \\\\\\ Photo: Joshua McHugh As a firm owner and leader, Graziolo strives to foster collaboration and create a space where staff members can freely share diverse points of view. With offices in Manhattan and Miami, the firm is noted for reviving landmark properties, uncovering the unique elements to bring them to light once again. No matter which city Graziolo is in at any given moment, she is ready to capture interesting things to enhance her own creative process. “I don’t use one specific method; I mix it up,” she notes. “I take lots of photos, doodle in my sketchbook, and collect objects or images that I find inspirational.” Today, Elizabeth Graziolo joins us for Friday Five! Photos: Elizabeth Graziolo 1. Sunsets This slide captures the profound inspiration drawn from observing a sunset – a reminder of nature’s ability to inform and elevate design. The photograph, taken with my iPhone from my apartment, encapsulates the vibrant, dynamic hues of the setting sun. These natural colors became the foundation for a mood board that guided a recent project. The warm, glowing tones inspired the selection of Beatrice Serre’s copper-skinned mirror, while the delicate raindrops on the windowpane influenced the choice of Lindsey Adelman’s Knotty Bubbles chandelier. Finally, the fluidity and depth of the water informed the inclusion of De Gournay’s fish-themed wallpaper, completing a harmonious interplay between nature and design. Photo: Elizabeth Graziolo 2. Bibliotheque Nationale de Paris I always find this picture so inspiring on so many levels, from its innovation to the materials and finishes. Photo: Elizabeth Graziolo 3. Alia Ali The artwork by Alia Ali serves as a profound source of inspiration. There’s an enigmatic quality to this piece that invites endless interpretation. To me, it explores the interplay of form and shape, masterfully presented in a fluid and dynamic context, leaving the viewer’s imagination to fill in the narrative. Photos: Courtesy of Elizabeth Graziolo 4. Nature We often draw inspiration from nature. On the slide above, we took inspiration from many pictures of Central Park which inspired the creation of a custom mural by Dean Barger for 200 East Building. Photo: Elizabeth Graziolo 5. Door Knockers I’m absolutely fascinated by door knockers – they’re a universal feature found across cultures, often carrying symbolic meanings. I love exploring their designs and imagining the stories or intentions behind them. This particular one is from South America, featuring an elephant trunk, a design I haven’t seen anywhere else. I like to think it reflects the homeowner’s wish for wealth and prosperity.
