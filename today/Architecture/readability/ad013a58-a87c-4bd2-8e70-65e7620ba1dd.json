  "text": "A New Home for Bay Football ClubThe upcoming Bay FC Training Facility, designed by Olson Kundig, has been unveiled as the future home of Bay Football Club (Bay FC), the Bay Area’s first National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) team. The project will be located on Treasure Island in San Francisco, offering panoramic views of the Financial District, Golden Gate Bridge, Sausalito, the Bay Bridge, and East Bay. Designed to empower athletes and support staff while encouraging community engagement, the new training center marks a major step in Bay FC’s evolution into a global sports franchise.‘In order to be a global sports franchise, the team needs its own home and dedicated facility. Tom Kundig and the Olson Kundig team understand our priority of player-centricity and also designed an inspirational and stunning space which reflects a sense of home for our players and staff,’ says Bay FC CEO Brady Stewart. ‘Olson Kundig are true innovators and are helping us future proof the facility and create something uniquely designed for our athletes that will nurture the whole person and unlock maximum potential.’visualizations © Olson Kundigolson kundig sets standard for athlete-focused designWith the design of its Bay FC Training Facility, Olson Kundig integrates sports science with a warm, residential feel to set a new standard for athlete-focused design. The architects incorporate human-scaled proportions, natural materials, and central courtyards to create a bright, well-ventilated environment. Locally-sourced materials and immersive environmental graphics reinforce a sense of home while embodying Bay FC’s identity. The facility is designed to foster team cohesion, performance, and personal development.Bay FC Training Facility reflects the unique climate and cultural history of California, anchoring it as both a symbolic and literal center for the team. Tom Kundig emphasizes that the design acknowledges the athletes’ commitment to training, teamwork, and excellence.
