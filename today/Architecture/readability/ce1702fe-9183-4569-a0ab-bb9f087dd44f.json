The 51-year-old Brutalist structure, which was originally designed by Jeffrey Howlett and Donald Bailey, will undergo an over $98.5 million state-of-the-art reworking to enhance its visitor experience and public spaces. A much-needed restoration of the building's plinth will be enacted in addition to refurbished lobbies on both building levels One and Two, with a new foyer and musicians’ lounge/patrons' area added to the former. Perth-based WITH Architecture Studio are included on the project team. The expectation is for renovations to be complete by the end of 2028. You may remember OMA was behind a colorful design for the city's PRINCIPLES Square earlier this year.",
