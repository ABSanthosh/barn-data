Built as part of the Grand Paris Express transport system, Saint-Denis Pleyel Station has an angular form made up of wedge-shaped tiers wrapped in external ramps. It acts as an interchange between four metro lines and connects with an existing urban bridge, providing access to the existing RER D transport lines. RIBA announced a David Chipperfield-designed office as one of the shortlisted projects for its International PrizeIn other architecture news, the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) announced a three-strong shortlist for its biannual International Prize. The projects in the running to be named the world's best building by RIBA were an office in Germany by David Chipperfield, a museum in China by O-office Architects and a social housing project in Spain by Peris + Toral Arquitectes. Design Mumbai celebrated its inaugural editionFollowing the opening of the inaugural Design Mumbai fair, Dezeen spoke with co-founder Piyush Suri about the country's rapidly growing design industry. According to Suri, India's booming real estate and a fast-growing middle class are key components to the growth in the architecture and interior design market, which he thinks will further \"triple in the next five years\". Michelle Ogundehin argued for the \"homesteading\" lifestyle trendMichelle Ogundehin wrote about the adoption of the \"homesteading\" lifestyle among Gen Zs and millennials in the pursuit of a quieter life experience. Rather than this lifestyle switch being \"a blissed-out opt-out\", Ogundehin believes it could be an \"empowering\" alternative to fast-paced consumerism. The Nest exhibition was showcased at Designart TokyoWe highlighted six key projects at this year's Designart Tokyo, including the Nest exhibition of seating and chunky clothing made from woven rice straw. Also this week, we selected six eclectic innovations that were recently presented at Seoul Design 2024, ranging from an udder-shaped battery charging system to a line of cosmetics made from wine industry byproducts.
