  "text": "Saint of Athens curates Temps Perdu, a dough lab in PiraeusCreative studio Saint of Athens designs Temps Perdu, in Piraeus, Athens, Greece, a bakery and patisserie that bridges past and present through taste and memory. Named after Marcel Proust’s ‘In Search of Lost Time,’ the new gastronomical project explores the concept of ‘lost time’ as moments recaptured through sensory experiences, particularly taste. The name ‘Temps Perdu’ conveys the idea of time slipping away unnoticed, yet regained when relived as meaningful experiences. Each product aims to trigger memories, much like Proust’s madeleine cake, and offers enduring moments of pleasure through carefully crafted flavors.Housed in a renovated commercial building in Piraeus, the design of the ‘dough lab’ merges French culinary tradition with modern industrial aesthetics. A transparent facade invites passersby to observe the preparation process, fostering interaction between the street and the interior. A large, fixed window on the first floor enhances visibility, further integrating the process into the urban fabric.all images by Giagkos Papadopoulosindustrial aesthetics and exposed materials adorn Temps PerduThe interior employs raw construction materials, exposed details, and minimalist lighting to create a balance between urban and industrial elements. Concrete and marble emphasize a sense of stripped-down elegance and timelessness. Carefully curated by Saint of Athens, this setting reflects the meticulous care and time invested in the preparation of every product.Temps Perdu operates as a dough lab, blending traditional French techniques with modern innovation. The team uses seasonal, locally sourced ingredients to craft products that combine creativity with authenticity. The space is imbued with the aromas of dough and fresh ingredients, offering a sensory experience that begins even before tasting. From croissants to inventive sweet and savory creations, every item is crafted to be both a culinary and visual experience. The preparation of each product reflects a harmony of flavors and textures, elevating them into small works of art that resonate with memory and tradition.Temps Perdu by Saint of Athens blends French culinary tradition with modern industrial design in PiraeusThe culinary team at Temps Perdu is led by Chef Yiannis Vlasiou and Baker Dimitris Dritsas.
