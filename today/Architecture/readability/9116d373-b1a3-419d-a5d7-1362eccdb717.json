From rolling hills to fertile valleys, the designs in this collection integrate with their surroundings, becoming part of the terrain they inhabit. By sinking into the earth or following the contours of the landscape, these cultural, commercial and community-focused buildings honor natural forms while creating spaces for learning, working and gathering. So without further ado, let’s explore these seven remarkable examples where design meets the land. Anji Creative \u0026 Design Center By Atelier Deshaus, Huzhou, China Jury Winner, Architecture +Landscape, 12th Annual A+Awards In the tea fields of Anji County, the ACDC follows the natural contours of the land, integrating architecture with the rolling terrain. The roof is planted with greenery to echo the patterns of tea cultivation, creating a strong connection to the landscape. Spaces for co-working, creative labs and public events are spread across the site, linked by elevated walkways that guide visitors through the fields. The design reflects the agricultural heritage of the region while supporting modern uses. Visitors are free to explore the corridors and pathways, staying connected to the tea fields at all times. The architecture brings together tradition and contemporary needs, creating a meaningful addition to the countryside. Skamlingsbanken Visitor Centre By CEBRA, Kolding, Denmark Popular Choice Winner, Cultural and Expo Centers, 12th Annual A+Awards Carved into the rolling hills of Southern Jutland, the Skamlingsbanken Visitor Centre lies almost hidden within the glacial landscape. Its design draws inspiration from the site’s contours, creating a curved hill that houses exhibitions, teaching spaces and a café. Visitors walk through pathways that flow between the land and interior spaces, where earthy materials like clay and terrazzo reflect the natural surroundings. A panoramic window at the heart of the centre frames sweeping views of the Little Belt Strait, offering a moment of reflection. The project expanded the protected area from 35 to 128 hectares, supporting rare local flora with carefully selected grass mixtures. It honors the site’s history and biodiversity in equal measure. Chengdu Museum of Contemporary Art, Tianfu Library of Humanity and Art By CSWADI, Chengdu, China Jury Winner, Libraries, 12th Annual A+Awards Tianfu Art Park combines art and nature with two key landmarks: the Chengdu Museum of Contemporary Art and the Tianfu Library of Humanity and Art. Their curved roofs rise like mountains, inspired by the nearby western Chengdu landscape. The Chengdu Museum is a space for exhibitions, installations and events. Large curtain walls and skylights bring in natural light and views of the surrounding lake. The Tianfu Library, designed as a “Book Mountain,” features terraced reading platforms and book walls that encourage exploration. Visitors can move through paths designed for discovery and quiet moments. The park provides a space where culture, learning and the outdoors come together. Bona Villa · Gaoling Suji By ANT ARCH, Ji’An, China Popular Choice Winner, Architecture +For Good, 11th Annual A+Awards This project addresses the challenges of disappearing “hollow villages” by reconnecting architecture with the natural environment. Inspired by traditional ecological wisdom, the design preserves the rustic character of the site while integrating buildings into the valley. Using local materials such as rammed earth, black tiles and timber, the project restores the village’s pitched roofs, earth walls and courtyards. Sunlight filtering through century-old ginkgo trees creates shifting patterns of light and shadow, adding a poetic quality to the space. Construction avoided large machinery to protect the site, relying on local resources. New spaces like a makers’ center and agricultural workshops support local tourism and economic growth, creating a sustainable model for rural development in South China. Museum of Ethnography By NAPUR Architect, Budapest, Hungary Popular Choice Winner, Museum, 11th Annual A+Awards Popular Choice Winner, Architecture +Facades, 11h Annual A+Awards As part of the Liget Budapest Project, the Museum of Ethnography is a striking addition to City Park, with over 60% of its structure built underground. Its curving, grass-covered roof creates a public space while linking the urban area with the park. The building’s façade features nearly half a million metal pixels arranged in ethnographic patterns, reflecting the museum’s global and Hungarian collections. Inside, flexible spaces accommodate exhibitions, events and research, offering visitors an immersive experience of cultural heritage. Supported by cutting-edge structural technology and designed for sustainability, the museum provides a home for its 250,000-piece collection in harmony with its natural and urban surroundings. Library in the Earth By Hiroshi Nakamura \u0026 NAP, Japan Located within an agricultural site, Library in the Earth is built beneath the surface to preserve the fertile soil above. Shaped like a water drop when seen from above, the library offers a quiet retreat for farmers and visitors. A corridor of bookshelves greets visitors as they enter the earthen structure, where walls, floors and ceilings are finished with soil. The roof is covered with lush greenery, aiding water retention and irrigation. Inside, spaces vary in height, with hidden rooms for children and a storytelling hall surrounded by stepped seating and bookshelves. The design reflects the interconnectedness of life, soil and community, creating a space that celebrates both nature and human wisdom. Office crahayjamaigne By crahayjamaigne, Malmedy, Belgium This workplace is designed to integrate into its natural surroundings with minimal visual and environmental impact. Built into a hillside, the structure is partially underground, with green roofs and grey-toned wood siding that echo the landscape. Access is discreet, with the entrance and underground parking tucked into the slope. Inside, spaces transition from reception areas to work zones, with large windows maintaining a constant connection to the surrounding nature. A central multipurpose area encourages interaction while offering views of the hill. Sustainability is key, with zero-energy certification, solar panels, rainwater storage and geothermal systems. A flower meadow, maintained by sheep and bees, further connects the project to its environment.
