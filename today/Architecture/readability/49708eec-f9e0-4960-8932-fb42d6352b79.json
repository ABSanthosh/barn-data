In the 21st century, museums are no longer passive containers of culture; they are active participants in shaping daily life. These winning projects from the 13th A+Awards present a curated selection of recent museum projects from around the world that exemplify this shift. These institutions are not only spaces for reflection and learning but also engines of urban regeneration, social interaction and cultural identity. From the adaptive reuse of industrial relics in Beijing to the sensitive restoration of historic civic buildings in the UK and Portugal, each project demonstrates how architecture can bridge the past and present, the local and global, and tradition and innovation. These museums embrace hybrid functions, combining exhibition, retail, education and community gathering, challenging conventional typologies and expanding the role of the museum in public life. 1. Living Cultural Infrastructure FW JI· The Rural Memory Museum By IARA, Huangshan City, China Jury Winner, Architecture +For Good; Popular Choice Winner, Architecture +Localism, 13th Architizer A+Awards Unlike conventional museums that enshrine artifacts behind glass, the Rural Memory Museum redefines the typology as a living space for both remembrance and daily ritual. Elevated above an open-air gathering area, the building fuses exhibition and infrastructure, offering shaded, rain-protected space for local weddings, funerals and village feasts. Drawing from the courtyard traditions of southern Anhui, the architecture embraces vernacular materials and forms while inverting spatial hierarchies to prioritize outward-facing community engagement. Rather than monumentalizing history, it cultivates shared memory through intimate storytelling, transforming the museum into a contemporary ancestral hall for a rural population in flux. 2. Historic Restoration Perth Museum By Mecanoo, Perth, United Kingdom Jury Winner, Museum, 13th Architizer A+Awards Mecanoo’s 2024 transformation of Perth’s former City Hall into the Perth Museum is an excellent example of architectural restoration, preserving the architectural legacy while making it relevant today. Originally built in 1914, the Edwardian structure has been revitalized to serve as a modern exhibition and cultural center. The design respects the building’s historic grandeur while introducing contemporary spatial dynamics and accessibility. This adaptive reuse project not only preserves a civic landmark but also repositions it as a vibrant cultural destination. 3. Embedding Culture in Nature The Sorol Art Museum MeierPartners Architects, Gangneung-si, South Korea Popular Choice Winner, Museum, 13th Annual A+Awards Located on the Gyo-Dong 7 Public Park in Gangneung, the Sorol Art Museum by MeierPartners Architects offers a cultural retreat with panoramic views of the sea and mountains. Completed in 2024, the museum sits atop a natural plateau. The ground floor connects directly to the public park, enhancing accessibility and community interaction. With its modernist aesthetic and contextual sensitivity, the museum is both a landmark and a gathering space. 4. Expanding Access to Culture Folger Shakespeare Library KieranTimberlake, Washington, DC Jury Winner, Architecture +Renovation, 13th Architizer A+Awards The 2024 renovation of the Folger Shakespeare Library by KieranTimberlake marks a new chapter for this iconic institution. Over a decade in planning, the project enhances public engagement through new galleries, a café, and collaborative research spaces. Accessibility upgrades and modernized infrastructure ensure the library’s continued relevance. The design balances respect for the historic fabric with a forward-looking vision, expanding the library’s reach and reaffirming its role as a cultural and scholarly landmark. 5. Designing with Local Sensitivity Vila do Bispo Museum spaceworkers, Vila do Bispo, Portugal In 2024, spaceworkers completed the Vila do Bispo Museum, a sensitive intervention that honors the identity of its site. The design introduces a new volume that mirrors the form of adjacent structures, creating a sense of continuity while asserting its own architectural presence. This addition serves as the museum’s main entrance, blending seamlessly with the existing building while marking a clear moment of transformation. The project exemplifies thoughtful contextual design, preserving heritage while embracing the future. 6. Reimagining Industrial Heritage Valley Strolling: X Museum Studio NOR, Langyuan Station, China Valley Strolling: X Museum, designed by Studio NOR in 2023, shows how old structures can be reimagined for new civic purposes. Located in a repurposed 1970s red-brick factory at Langyuan Station, the museum embraces a hybrid identity: part cultural hub, part lifestyle venue. The adaptive reuse of the industrial structure reflects a layered architectural narrative, combining historical textures with modern interventions. Its openness to trends and popularity challenges conventional museum norms, inviting broader public engagement. 7. Expressing Identity Through Form Yohoo Museum Aedas, Hangzhou, China Designed by Aedas and led by Ken Wai, the Yohoo Museum in Hangzhou’s Yuhang District is inspired by the symbolism of jade. Completed in 2024, the museum’s aerial form features two interlocking rings, evoking ancient Chinese jade artifacts and symbolizing the connection between Liangzhu culture and the Grand Canal. This architectural metaphor bridges past and present. The museum anchors the Liangzhu Yohoo Park, enhancing the district’s identity as a historical and artistic hub. 8. Bridging Tradition and Innovation Tianfu Museum of Traditional Chinese Medicine MUDA-Architects, Sichuan, China MUDA-Architects’ Tianfu Museum of Traditional Chinese Medicine, completed in 2024, is a monumental cultural project in Pengzhou, Sichuan. Situated within the Tianfu TCM City, the 139,930-square-foot (13,000-square-meter) museum celebrates the region’s rich medicinal heritage. Surrounded by natural and infrastructural landmarks, the museum is both an educational and experiential space. Its design reflects a harmonious blend of tradition and innovation, supporting China’s national strategy to revitalize traditional medicine.
