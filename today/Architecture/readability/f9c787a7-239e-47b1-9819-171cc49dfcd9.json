Linear yet fragmented by courtyards, the spatial sequence cultivates an interplay of openness and privacy, as WY Design describes it. Twin houses by WY DesignThe entrance courtyard provides a gentle transition from street to home, thoughtfully designed to avoid windows facing parked cars or the street—a common privacy issue in countryside homes that often leads to closed windows. The central courtyard transforms bedrooms into garden retreats, while the rear garden extends the social spaces outdoors. This arrangement ensures that every room is bathed in natural light, naturally ventilated, and attuned to the changing atmospheres of weather and time. Clad in pastel pink and yellow pigmented concrete, both inside and out, and complemented by pigmented micro-cement floors, the twin houses present a monolithic yet delicate visage, reminiscent of Hungarian village charm.

The formal simplicity is enriched by brick parapets and concealed rainwater systems, maintaining a low eaves height for a humble and approachable scale. Working closely with local builders to explore and achieve non-standard details and a streamlined aesthetic, WY Design aspired to transcend minimalist construction. ‘It is perceived as a sincere and thoughtful alternative to traditional Hungarian countryside homes, emphasising architectural quality, craftsmanship, and a connection to the landscape,’ concludes the studio. entrance viewinterior perspectives of the twin houses by WY Design",
