  "text": "When Marta Ordovás Lladó says that her new house is “the home she had always dreamed of,” it is more than just a cliché she’s repeating. As children, the Spanish designer and her sister had a game: If they passed a house they would like to live in, they would pretend to ring the doorbell, shout “it’s me!,” and then run away and hide. Years later, they remembered that childhood joke when they went out running together and, getting lost in the streets of a neighborhood in the north of Madrid, Ordovás imagined herself knocking on the door of a home she saw. Then the pandemic hit, she decided to move, and after searching extensively, she saw photos of a house with “incredible vibes,” without initially knowing its exact location.The original wooden floors on the porch were preserved. In the background, a glass table from María Lladó and armchairs from a flea market, as well as the frame of an un-upholstered chair used as a support for a canvas. The entrance captures the concept behind the renovation—a neutral framework of plaster walls, microcement floors, and white carpeting on the staircase which is then dotted with colorful details. Instead of getting rid of the old railing, they updated it by painting it red. On the wall is a work by Sonia Morales based on a photograph by María Bolin. On the day of the visit, when her taxi stopped in front of the house, she could tell this was the house she had always wanted. The 1950s building had unique details but it was also dark and had been divided into too many smaller spaces, with drop ceilings and black woodwork. It has now been transformed into an open, bright, and colorful home, with a personality as distinctive and welcoming as that of its owner. She knew that day it was a match, the perfect project for someone who likes to “restore old things that still have life in them,” from clothes to furniture and, of course, her own home.“Change everything without changing anything”Laia Cervelló and Miguel Fernández-Galiano of Nula.Studio, the team who were responsible for the renovation, understood Ordovás’s approach right away. While it may sound like a paradox, she wanted to “change everything without changing anything.” The designers embraced the idea of transforming the home without replacing anything and intervening without eliminating anything that already existed. To do this, they decided to “neutralize everything and then highlight the most special elements,” they explain. The starting point was the original floor on the ground level, a mosaic of blue, red, green, and yellow tiles. Here they implemented a strategy based on preserving, recovering, and completing. That is, they kept original fragments, restored essential elements, and filled in the gaps with microcement, achieving an architectural connection between past and present. This same strategy was then repeated throughout the entire house.The large built-in sofa was chosen in response to a specific request from the owner. The green upholstery and curtains are by Gancedo. The yellow armchair is from María Lladó, and the leather, steel, and rosewood armchair from the 1970s is from El Guateque. On the left, a ceramic rooster from the Mercadillo de Santo Domingo; on the right, a large painting by Lorena Ventimiglia, next to a smaller work by Blanca Muñoz. A family affairThe result was a neutral backdrop—plaster walls and light-colored floors—with touches of color inserted to bring the space to life. The original railing, for example, has now been painted red while the yellow lacquered dining room table and a wooden bookcase are custom designs by Ordovás. Her interest in interior decoration runs in the family including with her aunt, interior designer María Lladó, whose influence is seen in some of the vintage light fixtures, the unusual armchairs, the collection of Murano glass ashtrays, and the striking rug in the living room. “I was excited to have those who have always inspired me—my mother, my aunt, my grandfather—be reflected in my home. The green upholstery on the sofa reminds me of some fabrics by Gustavo Torner that were in my grandparents’ house,” she explains. She was determined to have her own custom sofa made, and it proved to be a wise decision.",
