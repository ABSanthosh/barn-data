  "text": "In Montreal’s leafy Notre-Dame-de-Grâce neighbourhood, a 1905 home has been reimagined by RobitailleCurtis for a young doctor couple seeking more space and flow. What began as a pandemic purchase evolved into a sensitive expansion, making way for a growing family and a lifestyle rooted in clarity and connection. A modest seven-foot addition to the rear created room for a new kitchen, dining area, and deck, spaces now defined by warmth, tactility, and meticulous detail. At the heart of the newly expanded home is a warm, sculptural kitchen where every element feels carefully considered. Anchoring the space is a custom island clad in white oak slats, meticulously detailed to wrap around its curved edges. These slats are more than aesthetic, they conceal deep drawers and storage, while flowing gracefully around a recessed seating area designed for casual meals and conversation. The island’s form softens the geometry of the room, inviting movement and reinforcing the home’s calm, contemporary character. The main kitchen wall mirrors this craftsmanship, with floor-to-ceiling oak panels that conceal generous cabinetry, integrated appliances, and a seamless coffee bar. Flush, curved handles, designed in collaboration with Montreal-based millwork studio Kastella, maintain the minimalist visual rhythm while offering tactile depth. The oak grain adds organic warmth, balancing the cool precision of porcelain tile flooring underfoot and crisp white walls that reflect the daylight pouring in through expansive west-facing glass. Natural light plays a key role in the kitchen’s feel. A large sliding door opens onto a new raised deck, allowing the interior to flow directly outside. The openness is matched by material restraint: wood, stone, glass, and tile work together to create a bright and breathable space that supports daily routines without visual clutter. Adjacent to the kitchen, the dining area is anchored by a built-in oak banquette that offers both seating and integrated storage, with detailing that mirrors the white oak slats of the nearby island. Its rounded backrest and soft edges make the space feel intimate and welcoming, perfect for family meals or quiet moments with a coffee. Echoing the island’s softened form, an enclosed volume at one end conceals a powder room. Its location within the island structure is clever, preserving openness without compromising on function. The space maintains the oak and porcelain palette, and benefits from the same soft-edged detailing that defines the rest of the kitchen. Through careful detailing, natural materials, and a focus on flow, RobitailleCurtis has created a home that feels both deeply personal and effortlessly functional. The result is a warm, contemporary interior where everyday moments unfold with ease and quiet beauty.
