Hidden in plain sight, across from the grand Scuola della Misericordia and only glimpsed from passing boats, the retreat is accessed discreetly via its own porta d’acqua, or water gate.Conceived and curated by Mara De Guidi, a former fragrance executive turned hospitality visionary, the boutique hotel is a destination for lovers of design, art, and tranquility. De Guidi personally curated every element, from the tide-protective engineering system to the use of traditional Venetian materials like brocade, brass, and Murano glass. A bespoke composition of textures and scents completes each suite, enhanced by Diptyque amenities, handpicked linens, and daily offerings of fresh fruit and desserts. The residence is centered around its lush private garden, a notable part of the Wigwam Club’s appreciation for botanical culture and heritage.practical info: name: Madama Garden Retreat | @madama_venice location: Sestiere Cannaregio 3604, 30121, Veniceimages courtesy of Madama Garden Retreatvenice venice hotelThe Venice Venice Hotel reimagines the legacy of the Ca’ da Mosto palazzo, one of the oldest buildings along the Grand Canal, as a five-star retreat.

Originally built in the 15th century and once home to legendary figures like mercenary captain Pandolfo Malatesta and the ill-fated Count of Carmagnola, the palace has seen its share of drama, grandeur, and transformation.After a fire in 1845 destroyed its canal-facing facade, the damaged section was eventually replaced with a garden that adds to the charm of the property. Inside, frescoes from the 19th century still line the hallways, painted to reflect scenes of Venice’s social life, while ornate ceilings, gilded beams, and a stunning marble staircase have all been carefully restored. The building has changed hands over the years, from noble families to collectors, and each chapter left its mark.Following a meticulous restoration completed in 2016, the historic palace reopened as Palazzo Venart – Luxury Hotel. With just a handful of rooms, a peaceful courtyard garden, and sweeping views of the Grand Canal, it offers guests an intimate way to experience Venice.practical info: name: Palazzo Venart | @palazzovenart location: Calle Tron, 1961, 30135, Veniceimages courtesy of Palazzo VenartDESIGNBOOM VENICE GUIDE: where to eatABC ZattereAs part of the evolving cultural identity of Scuola Piccola Zattere, Fosbury Architecture completes the new ABC Zattere restaurant, bringing together architecture, design, and food. Following the studio’s November 2024 intervention for the institution, the restaurant extends the same values of continuity, openness, and material sensitivity. The project subtle references Venice’s convivial spaces, historic cafés, shaded courtyards, and the language of civic architecture.The transformation of the courtyard centers the project, now envisioned as an integral part of Scuola Piccola’s cultural program. The architects introduce a continuous surface of brick paving, developed in collaboration with Fornaci Sant’Anselmo and embedded with recycled glass, echoing the Venetian tradition of terrazzo. Salvaged Istrian stone from the nearby Arsenale restoration is reworked into a linear bench, and a new pergola structure – referencing the movable canopy of the Scuola Grande di San Rocco – frames the space for gatherings and performances throughout the warmer months.Inside, bespoke elements like the custom boiserie reinterpret the visual identity of the Scuola with a nod to the warm intimacy of classic Venetian interiors. The project is completed with iconic furniture, including Enzo Mari’s Mariolina chair for Magis, and a menu by chefs Jack Martin and Nathan Cal Danby that puts seasonal ingredients and natural wines at the center of the experience. practical info: name: ABC Zattere | @abczattere location: Dorsoduro 1401, Veniceimage courtesy of ABC Zatterezanze XVIJust a short walk from Venice’s Santa Lucia train station, set along the quiet Fondamenta dei Tolentini, Zanze XVI feels like a Venetian tavern, but what arrives at the table is thoughtful, modern, and full of surprise. Chef Giovanni Rigoni leads a young, talented team, creating seasonal menus inspired by the lagoon and its surroundings with every dish baginning with ingredients hand-picked from local markets. Dishes are served for the whole table, in the tradition of local osterie, and vegetarian options are available with a bit of notice. There’s also a Chef’s Table for private gatherings, and an outdoor terrace when the weather’s right.practical info:name: Zanze XVI | @zanzexvi location: Fondamenta dei Tolentini, 231, 30135, Venice suggested by: Sam Baron | @sam__baronimage courtesy of Zanze XVIgelateria paolin dal 1760One of Venice’s oldest gelaterias, Gelateria Paolin dal 1760 sits proudly on Campo Santo Stefano, drawing both locals and visitors with its creamy, flavorful gelato and laid-back vibe. With tables spilling into the square, it’s a perfect spot to pause between museums and bridgesThe gelato is what most people come for, but Paolin offers more than sweets. Their coffee is excellent (worth a stop on its own), and the menu extends to light bites, spritzes, and pastries for any time of day.practical info: name: Gelateria Paolin dal 1760 location: Campo Santo Stefano, 2962, 30124, Venice suggested by: Sam Baron | @sam__baron cantina del vino gia schiavi – vini al bottegonJust beyond the busiest thoroughfares of Venice, Cantina Schiavi offers an authentic glimpse into the city’s everyday rhythm, where locals and curious visitors alike gather to share a glass of wine and a plate of freshly prepared cicchetti in true bacaro tradition.This historic wine bar and shop, with its shelves lined with over five hundred carefully selected bottles, from regional Italian labels to grappa, whisky, and rare liqueur, is both a neighborhood institution and a casual culinary stop. There are no seats here, only people standing elbow-to-elbow, enjoying panini made to order with fresh salumi, or sampling the day’s seasonal cicchetti, all prepared by the in-house cook. At lunchtime, the space hums with regulars grabbing a quick bite, while in the early evening, it transforms into a spirited gathering spot for aperitivo, with prosecco and spritz flowing freely. practical info: name: Cantina Del Vino Gia Schiavi – Vini Al Bottegon | @cantinaschiavi location: Fondamenta Nani, 992, 30123, Venice suggested by: Sam Baron | @sam__baron image courtesy of Cantina Del Vino Gia Schiavi – Vini Al Bottegonristorante localSituated between Piazza San Marco and the Biennale, Local is a modern Venetian restaurant built on deep roots. It was opened in 2015 by siblings Benedetta and Luca Fullin, who grew up in Venice and wanted to create a place that felt both familiar and forward-thinking. The name Local speaks to that idea – it’s about territory, community, and, in Venetian dialect (Locàl), a gathering spot. Today, Benedetta runs the restaurant with her partner, Manuel Trevisan. Together, they’re shaping a style of hospitality that’s relaxed but precise, rooted in tradition but open to change. In the kitchen, chef Salvatore Sodano brings a fresh take on Venetian flavors using local ingredients. practical info:name: Local location: Salizada dei Greci, 3303, 30122, Venice suggested by: Juliane Rohrimage courtesy of LocalquadriLocated above the historic Grancaffè in Piazza San Marco, Ristorante Quadri is helmed by Max Alajmo and executive chefs Silvio Giavedoni and Sergio Preziosa. The Michelin-starred restaurant offers refined interpretations of classic Italian and Venetian cuisine, with ingredients sourced directly from the lagoon. Guests can choose from two tasting menus or à la carte options, each paired with a curated wine list that features both local producers and international names. The interiors, redesigned by Philippe Starck and the Alajmo brothers in 2018, were brought to life by local artisans who preserved the palazzo’s layered history while revealing its original grandeur.practical info:name: Quadri | @alajmo location: Piazza San Marco, 121, 30124, Venice suggested by: UNIMATIC | @unimaticwatchesimage courtesy of Ristorante Quadriharry’s bar \u0026 harry’s dolciHarry’s Bar in Calle Vallaresso, Venice is a legendary place that’s been around since 1931. Over the years, it became a favorite hangout for all kinds of famous people, from movie stars and writers to artists and even royalty. It’s where big names like Ernest Hemingway, Katherine Hepburn, and Frank Lloyd Wright would come to relax, chat, and enjoy the vibe. Harry’s Bar feels warm and casual, like a cozy club where everyone knows each other or quickly becomes friends. The staff are friendly and laid-back, making sure you feel comfortable without any fuss or pressure. This easygoing spirit made Harry’s Bar so special that the Italian government recognized it as a National Landmark. Carrying forward that same spirit of hospitality and charm, Harry’s Dolci opened 50 years later, in 1981, on the peaceful Giudecca Canal. Open from spring through autumn, it offers guests an escape where they can unwind by the water, savoring the gentle rhythm of passing boats. With its elegant white tablecloths, welcoming interior, and attentive service, Harry’s Dolci mirrors the timeless appeal of its iconic sibling.practical info: name: Harry’s Bar location: Calle Vallaresso, 1323, 30124 Venicename: Harry’s Dolci | @cipriani location: Fondamenta S.

It was opened in 2015 by siblings Benedetta and Luca Fullin, who grew up in Venice and wanted to create a place that felt both familiar and forward-thinking. The name Local speaks to that idea – it’s about territory, community, and, in Venetian dialect (Locàl), a gathering spot. Today, Benedetta runs the restaurant with her partner, Manuel Trevisan. Together, they’re shaping a style of hospitality that’s relaxed but precise, rooted in tradition but open to change. In the kitchen, chef Salvatore Sodano brings a fresh take on Venetian flavors using local ingredients. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003epractical info:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ename: \u003c/strong\u003eLocal\u003cbr/\u003e \u003cstrong\u003elocation: \u003c/strong\u003eSalizada dei Greci, 3303, 30122, Venice\u003cbr/\u003e \u003cstrong\u003esuggested by:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jr.artynotes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eJuliane Rohr\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" alt=\"designboom\u0026#39;s guide to venice: what to see and do outside of the biennale\" width=\"818\" height=\"353\" data-src=\"https://static.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/venice-architecture-biennale-side-trip-modern-new-historic-must-sees-city-designboom-15.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/venice-architecture-biennale-side-trip-modern-new-historic-must-sees-city-designboom-15.jpg 818w, https://static.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/venice-architecture-biennale-side-trip-modern-new-historic-must-sees-city-designboom-15-768x331.jpg 768w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://static.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/venice-architecture-biennale-side-trip-modern-new-historic-must-sees-city-designboom-15.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/venice-architecture-biennale-side-trip-modern-new-historic-must-sees-city-designboom-15.jpg 818w, https://static.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/venice-architecture-biennale-side-trip-modern-new-historic-must-sees-city-designboom-15-768x331.jpg 768w\"/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eimage courtesy of Local\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003equadri\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLocated above the historic Grancaffè in Piazza San Marco, Ristorante Quadri is helmed by Max Alajmo and executive chefs Silvio Giavedoni and Sergio Preziosa.
