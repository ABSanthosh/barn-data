  "text": "Qicang Design crafts tea House as tranquil escape in chinaNestled at the crossroads of bustling streets in the coastal city of Ningbo, China, the XinHeYe Tea House by Qicang Design offers a serene retreat from urban chaos. Inspired by the rituals of tea and the rhythm of the seasons, the 80-square-meter space embodies the essence of tranquility, balancing tradition, innovation, and nature.Visitors approach the tea house via a curated path, flanked by dome-shaped greenery. Two plots of land brimming with lush plants lead to the understated entrance, where stepping stones are arranged in irregular spacing over a pond. Upon entering, the structure reveals itself as a quiet sanctuary—a black timber facade that integrates with the verdant surroundings. Inside, the architectural team draws on arid landscapes, warm tones, and organic materials to create a calming ambiance. Earth-toned walls are paired with dark furniture crafted from wood and stone, while olive and yellow accents unify the palette. The spatial layout is intentionally uncluttered, allowing light patterns to form as sliding and folding doors connect the interiors to the outdoor greenery.images courtesy of Qicang Designvarious textures compose the interior of XinHeYe Tea HouseThe interplay of light and shade transforms the Qicang Design’s XinHeYe Tea House throughout the day, enhancing its tranquil atmosphere. Two stone walls in the lobby introduce a tactile quality to the space. A sculptural niche in the stone provides a communal gathering point, with a fire feature whose flickering warmth evokes a sense of timeless ritual. At the heart of the tea house is a black wood and copper green metal bar counter, where tea and pastries are prepared. A five-meter-long mottled mirror visually expands the space, contrasting with the earthy textures of the shelving below.Furnishings and antiques, handpicked by the owner—from black lacquered fruit plates to European antique chairs—add layers and enhance the timelessness of the space while maintaining a central focus on practicality despite their theatrical placement. Seasonal changes are celebrated through floral installations and curated tea rituals, encapsulating the passage of time. From spring cherry blossoms to winter snow, the tea house reflects the natural cycles of life, creating an ever-evolving narrative. Nestled at the crossroads of bustling streets in the coastal city of Ningbo, Chinathe XinHeYe Tea House by Qicang Design offers a serene retreat from urban chaosinspired by the rituals of tea and the rhythm of the seasonsthe 80-square-meter space embodies the essence of tranquility, balancing tradition, innovation, and nature",
