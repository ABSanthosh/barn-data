Located in the garden of Pettanco House 2, in the Japanese Alps, the cabin hovers on a single-legged foundation, considering a new relationship with the landscape. The small wooden space covers a compact 10 sqm area and is cut off from the land on all four sides. One of the main aspects of the design was to create a new relationship between the landscape and the building, born from cutting the edge.all images courtesy of Yuji Tanabe Architectslocal Japanese larch shapes up Hovering CabinThe compact foundation directly reduces cost in this area where the freezing depth is deep. For the roof and exterior wall, Yuji Tanabe architectural team utilized siding materials made of local Japanese larch. The roof base employs a galvalume corrugated sheet, and the exterior wall base applies a highly durable waterproof sheet made in Germany. The client himself was fully involved in the construction of the roof and exterior wall.Yuji Tanabe Architects constructs Hovering Cabin in the Japanese Alpsthe cabin serves as a small local community center and office for a landscape designerthe cabin hovers on a single-legged foundationthe structure appears floating building a new relationship with the landscapethe design utilizes siding materials made of local Japanese larch",
