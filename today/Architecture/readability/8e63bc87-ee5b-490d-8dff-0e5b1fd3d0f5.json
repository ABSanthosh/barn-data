  "text": "expo 2025 osaka explores ‘ocean: the blue dialogue’At Expo 2025 Osaka, the Portugal Pavilion, designed by renowned architect Kengo Kuma, embodies Portugal’s dedication to sustainability and its deep historical connection to the ocean. Under the theme Ocean: The Blue Dialogue, the pavilion highlights Portugal’s role as a leader in addressing global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable development.The Portugal Pavilion, located in the Empowering Lives area of the Expo site, is an ethereal architectural interpretation of the ocean’s fluid movement. Kengo Kuma’s design features suspended ropes and recycled nets, symbolizing waves and creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow. These elements are both visually compelling and environmentally considerate, aligning with the pavilion’s theme of sustainability.The pavilion’s materials and design showcase a commitment to circular economy principles. By using durable, eco-friendly components, the structure minimizes its carbon footprint while offering visitors a sensory experience of the ocean’s fluidity and rhythm. The upper section of the pavilion appears to float, giving the impression of a wave caught mid-motion, a metaphorical gesture towards Portugal’s historic relationship with the sea.visualizations © Kengo Kuma \u0026 Associateskengo kuma plans two didactic sectionsThe architects led by Kengo Kuma design the Portugal Pavilion to span a 1,837-square-meter plot within Expo 2025 Osaka, dividing the space between two main exhibition sections. The first section, Sharing Knowledge, illustrates the historic and ongoing relationship between Portugal and Japan, initiated nearly five hundred years ago through maritime exploration. Visitors are invited to discover historical artifacts, artistic displays, and interactive exhibits that highlight technological advancements in ocean sustainability.The second section, Partnering for a Sustainable Future, provides an immersive multimedia experience. A specially created five-minute audiovisual installation encourages visitors to imagine a harmonious coexistence between humanity and the ocean. This section emphasizes the urgent need for marine conservation and sustainable innovation, spurring active dialogue about global environmental challenges.the pavilion is designed under the theme Ocean: The Blue Dialogue‘portugal dives into the oceans’In addition to exhibition spaces, the Kengo Kuma-designed Portugal Pavilion houses a restaurant showcasing Portuguese gastronomy, a retail shop, and a multi-purpose area for events at Expo 2025 Osaka. These features aim to promote Portugal’s blue economy, tourism, and cultural heritage. The strategic placement of the pavilion near the Expo’s Grand Ring creates a welcoming interaction between the two spaces.

It is, therefore, with the future in mind and the well-being of us all that we will present in Osaka, and also in Portugal, a Blue Dialogue of science, environment, economy, art, and culture in defence of our shared home: the blue planet.’the lightweight structure features suspended ropes and recycled netsthe upper section of the pavilion appears to float, giving the impression of a wave caught mid-motionproject info:project title: Portugal Pavilionarchitecture: Kengo Kuma and Associates | @kkaa_officialevent: Expo 2025 Osaka | @expo2025japan",
