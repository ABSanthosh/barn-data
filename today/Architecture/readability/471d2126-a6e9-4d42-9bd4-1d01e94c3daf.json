  "text": "netflix house to bring popular shows into the real worldNetflix is set to bring some of its most popular shows and films into the real world with Netflix House, a new kind of entertainment venue set to open in Philadelphia and Dallas by the end of 2025. Located inside the King of Prussia Mall and Galleria Dallas, respectively, the two permanent spaces will span over 9,290 square meters, offering fans a chance to step inside immersive environments inspired by the most iconic titles of the platform, including Stranger Things and Wednesday, as well as Squid Game and One Piece. A third venue is also confirmed for Las Vegas, slated to open in 2027.The venues, designed to be more than themed attractions, combine physical storytelling with hospitality and retail. Netflix House invites visitors all year round to explore interactive sets, dine at a show-inspired restaurant called Netflix Bites, and browse exclusive merchandise tied to different Netflix universes. Each location will feature a rotating lineup of experiences and installations, allowing returning guests to discover something new with each visit.Netflix House Philadelphia | all images courtesy of Netflix Housephiladelphia and dallas locations coming by the end of 2025In the Philadelphia Netflix House, guests will find a VR arcade based on Netflix shows, a nine-hole mini golf course called Top 9, and a screening space known as the Tudum Theater. The Dallas location will include Netflix RePLAY, a game-filled arena blending physical challenges with story-driven environments in an arcade-style setting. These activities are tied closely to familiar titles with obstacle courses inspired by Squid Game, moody walkthroughs set in the halls of Nevermore Academy, or adventures at sea with the One Piece crew, complete with snail phones and references to the Going Merry ship.Netflix House Dallaswelcoming guests to explore and dine subscription-freeWhile the experiences vary by location, both venues aim to reflect the broader focus of the streaming platform on inclusion and global storytelling. According to the company, the goal is to create welcoming spaces that feel accessible to all, whether or not you’re a Netflix subscriber. Guests can simply walk in, explore the installations, or enjoy a themed meal, no membership required.The retail side of Netflix House will offer exclusive apparel and collectibles, while Netflix Bites is expected to serve a menu influenced by scenes and characters from across its international catalog.

The venues shift how the company approaches fan engagement beyond screens to create destinations where people can revisit the stories they love.
