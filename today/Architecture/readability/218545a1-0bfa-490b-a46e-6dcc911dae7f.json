  "text": "1. Architecture for Dogs As a dog owner, lover, and self-proclaimed professional DIY-er, I bookmarked so many blueprints from this exhibition! Architecture for Dogs is such a unique celebration of our furry companions, showcasing creative and functional designs that go beyond traditional pet spaces. From ramps and cushions to a vertical doghouse that lets your dog gaze at you at eye level, I love that this project truly puts pets at the heart of design. It’s so cool to see how architecture can foster a deeper bond between humans and dogs while exploring new ways of cohabiting with our pets. Even more exciting, you can download the plans to build these innovative creations for your own dog – making it an interactive experience for pet lovers everywhere! (It’s currently on view at the ADI Design Museum until Feb. 16, 2025, and you can bring your pet!) 2. Traditional Tear-off Calendars As we celebrate Lunar New Year today, it’s the perfect time to reflect on traditions, and these two tear-off calendars make that easy and fun! Growing up, my family always had one hanging, and I love how these capture that same nostalgic feel. The first from @smallerthanthree.vn offers a daily link to Vietnamese culture with its minimalist, elegant design. Each page marks the date and lunar cycle and highlights important events like Vietnamese New Year, lucky hours, and even zodiac signs to guide your daily journey. While it’s now out of stock for 2025 (keep an eye out for next year!), the second by @duck.ruai x Haptic Editions brings just as much joy with its playful, frame-by-frame animation design. Not only is it a great way to track the year, but it can be reused for years to come, making it both sustainable and super fun! 3. The Parcel System from Cadence Traveling over the holiday season made me realize I didn’t have a solid system for organizing on the go, especially when it came to my skincare and makeup. Chaotic bags, clutter everywhere – it was a hot mess! With some trips lined up for the year, I’m hoping the Parcel System from Cadence will help me get it together a bit better. Versatile and featuring a modular design, you can connect multiple bags side-by-side for a completely customizable setup. Plus, it’s easy to clean and built to last! 4. Charles Kaisin’s Surrealist Dinners Oh, to even be a fly on the wall at one of Charles Kaisin’s surrealist dinners… Whether it’s fishing for ducks at the table or dining under a cosmic sky, these dinners are like something straight out of a whimsical dream! Each one is meticulously crafted around a theme that’s as bizarre as it is brilliant, creating a playful, almost Alice in Wonderland-like atmosphere that keeps guests talking for years! The stunning attention to detail, from the setting to the service, is absolutely amazing. Honestly, who wouldn’t want to dine in a grand château or a secret garden while indulging in this kind of creative madness? 5. Teatsy Vortex Kit I’m a big tea drinker, but I recently learned that teabags can release tons of microplastics, so I’ve been on the hunt for ways to steep loose-leaf tea. I came across the Vortex Kit from Teatsy and was instantly intrigued by its 360° rotational strainer. This clever design brews tea to perfection without over-steeping, and the set includes three minimalist teacups and a durable travel case for tea on the go. The best part? You can reuse the tea leaves multiple times, so you can savor every layer of flavor with each steep – all without the microplastics! As the Social Media Consultant, Maivy is always dreaming up new ideas to curate content. If she's not glued to her phone, she’s probably at the dog park with her pup Koda, training at the gym, or trying the latest food/drink trends! See the BTS of her life over on Instagram.",
