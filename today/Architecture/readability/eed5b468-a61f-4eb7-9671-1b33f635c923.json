  "text": "A Berlin interior designer refreshed the 1920s Art Nouveau manse with bright colors and a painstaking attention to detailDesigner Gisbert Pöppler’s reimagining of an Art Nouveau villa was just the right match for the taste of the new owner Katja Pütter-Ammer, who has a love of colorful interiors. All products featured on Architectural Digest are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.We’ve all been there. Two people live through the same experience, but then later each remembers it differently. One morning, two years ago, Gisbert Pöppler was standing in a German villa where he was supposed to do some minor renovations when it hit him that that there was nothing interesting or noteworthy about the home. In that early meeting, he mustered the courage to inform the client that the interior wasn’t unique or remarkable. “I recommended gutting the house and starting over,” the architect and interior designer says, even though that could easily have meant an early end to the project. Entrepreneur Katja Pütter-Ammer, who had just purchased the villa, has completely different memories of that morning. “I believed in Gisbert Pöppler right from the start, and that he was the right man for the job.” When he ultimately shared his plans with her, she thought: “Wow, that’s daring, and my husband said: ‘Oh God, I hope it turns out okay. But go for it.’” And what was it about Pöppler’s plan that won her over so quickly? “I love colors and I’m a spontaneous person. This house was also an impulse buy. My husband and I stood in front of it and knew, that’s the one. It just had a good vibe.”Angled sunlight highlights the unusual surface of the brick façade. The villa had been completely renovated once before, in the 1980s, though its landmark status kept the façade untouched. Inside, however, nothing original had been left in place and everything was new. Even the park-sized garden was run down when Pöppler started the project. The original house had its charms, and as part of the Hohenhagen Garden City it was also of historic interest. Nearby is the Hohenhof, a 1908 villa designed by Belgian architect Henry van de Velde. A leading exponent of Art Nouveau, van de Velde built the home for art patron Karl Ernst Osthaus, whose collection would form the core of the Museum Folkwang in Essen following Osthaus’s early death.Two Arpa outdoor armchairs from Bonacina 1889 overlook the natural swimming pool that looks like a pond. Originating in England, the Garden City movement was embraced in Germany by many leading architects of the day including Peter Behrens and Walter Gropius. The villa that Pütter-Ammer and her husband purchased was designed by local architects, the Ludwig brothers. Today, the city of Hagen, where their home is located, isn’t well known outside this region of Germany beyond its status as the Gateway to the Sauerland. In the first two decades of the 20th century, however, Hagen, which sits on the southern edge of the Ruhr region was a center of the European Garden City movement, thanks to visionaries such as Osthaus and van de Velde.The house’s park-like garden was designed by Berlin’s Royal Garden Academy. The Borea furniture on the terrace is by Piero Lissoni for B\u0026B Italia. Osthaus was also very involved in the Deutscher Werkbund, an association started in 1907 which included architects, artisans, and designers who sought to reunite art with crafts in response to Germany’s rapid industrialization, just as the earlier British Arts and Crafts movement had. That background provided Pöppler with a few decisive cues when designing the villa. Choosing the right materials is one thing. But you also need people who know how to work these materials to the correct standards, especially since the project was a “millimeter construction site,” according to Pöppler. That is, a building site where literally every millimeter counted given the precise design of the renovation.Pöppler chose Italian Muschelkalk limestone for the bathroom. He made the washbasin and mirror himself. “Outstanding craftsmanship is our passion,” says the Berlin designer. “Our clients enable us to work with great companies over and over again.” Anyone who has spent time in 1920s houses knows that spaces can often feel cramped. Pöppler turned three rooms that overlook the garden into one large living and dining room. He moved the extra-small kitchen in order to redesign a new one with Ofco, a kitchen interior company based in the city of Iserlohn, Germany, and created a suite on the second floor that includes a bedroom, dressing room, and large bathroom.A new staircase was placed in the same location as the old one. In contrast to the warm wood of the steps, the walls of the room are painted in a cool light blue. The staircase connecting the floors was rebuilt, and as a central motif of the redesign, Pöppler gave the passageways round arches. He opened up the conservatory entrance to make the space feel larger, just as he let more light into the house by installing oval wall openings (which he borrowed from Italian designer Luigi Caccia Dominioni whom he admires). Angling window openings are “an elaborate way of making them look larger than they are,” explains the architect, “and are particularly common in Switzerland.”Ceiling lights in the guest room are from Mawa Design. Visible in the background are some of the arched passageways found throughout the house. Pöppler commissioned a “fantastic freak” of a specialist from Berlin to produce the reddish terrazzo floor in the garden room, which is reminiscent of the Hohenhof’s interior. Another highly specialized team under master carpenter Stefan Freudenberger from the Bavarian town of Rimpar, near Würzburg, added rounded slats to wooden panels in the plinth area there (and at the entrance), which Pöppler chose so that “the room doesn't look so empty and bare.”The garden room has a dining table and a sideboard also designed by Pöppler. On the wall are Joy sconces by Draga \u0026 Aurel. The Cab 413 leather chairs were created by Mario Bellini for Cassina. The tableware is from KPM. The elegant two-tone kitchen was designed by Nicole Otto from Ofco, who also introduced the client to Pöppler. The green wall element is a signature piece that Pöppler designed for this house and which also serves as a shelf. The handles on the Ofco cabinets are by Gisbert Pöppler Objects. Freudenberger was also responsible for the special treatment that Pöppler wanted for the ceiling in the garden room. “It’s a kind of woodwork often found in yachts. Pressed planks make the wood extra hard and give it a nicely irregular and lively look. There are two carpenters in the workshop whose only job it is to replace overly large knotholes with nicer ones.” Pütter-Ammer—who holds a doctorate in medicine—and her husband are the third generation to run a medical company based on sustainability and naturopathy and they not only run their own apiary, but a culinary business as well. In other words, there’s usually a lot going on in the house and garden. “We regularly host guests and entertain here,” Pütter-Ammer says, “so it’s only natural that we live by our values.”The glassed-in addition leading out to the terrace lets in perfect light for reading. With all that sunshine, the room is even used as a mini orangery. Armchair by Pöppler with upholstery by Josef Frank for Svenskt Tenn. The Pütter-Ammers appreciate flowering meadows as one can see in the park that Berlin’s Royal Garden Academy created for them, with a large natural pool that looks like a pond serving as a swimming hole. The furniture in this welcoming house is made up of a mixture of design classics and pieces from Pöppler’s own furniture line. The fabrics for the sofa and armchair covers come from Dedar, Bute, Svenskt Tenn, and Le Manach, the latter now a collection under the Pierre Frey brand that Pöppler likes to work with as he says it offers greater flexibility when it comes to customization than almost anyone else. Even the door handles were specially designed and manufactured for the villa by a foundry in Belgium, perhaps motivated by a desire to honor Henry van de Velde’s Hohenhof. After two years of sweeping renovation work, it is this attention to seemingly minor details that convinced “impulse buyer” Pütter-Ammer that this house is now their home. “We will enjoy it for a very long time to come, I’m sure of it.”This German villa renovation was originally published by AD Germany.

Prefabricated architecture has always posed a more affordable and sustainable future for housing as they’re fast and cheaper to build and produce less waste in the long run, so why hasn’t it taken over?

With the help of florist to the stars, Jeff Leatham, green garlands, a classic tree, and vintage decorations lace the halls of her home creating a nostalgic atmosphere. Much of this nostalgia stems from decorations from Kendall’s childhood handed down from her mom Kris–most notably her collection of Christopher Radko tree ornaments. “Growing up with [those ornaments] every year, they became so special to me,” she says. “And I can’t wait to share that with my kids one day, but I love sharing this with my friends.

Pressed planks make the wood extra hard and give it a nicely irregular and lively look. There are two carpenters in the workshop whose only job it is to replace overly large knotholes with nicer ones.” Pütter-Ammer—who holds a doctorate in medicine—and her husband are the third generation to run a medical company based on sustainability and naturopathy and they not only run their own apiary, but a culinary business as well. In other words, there’s usually a lot going on in the house and garden. “We regularly host guests and entertain here,” Pütter-Ammer says, “so it’s only natural that we live by our values.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe glassed-in addition leading out to the terrace lets in perfect light for reading.

back by Kendall Jenner to tour her LA home while it’s decorated for Christmas. Over the years, the Kardashian-Jenner clan has become known for their flamboyant Christmas decorations but Kendall’s approach to holiday decorating is much more traditional. With the help of florist to the stars, Jeff Leatham, green garlands, a classic tree, and vintage decorations lace the halls of her home creating a nostalgic atmosphere. Much of this nostalgia stems from decorations from Kendall’s childhood handed down from her mom Kris–most notably her collection of Christopher Radko tree ornaments. “Growing up with [those ornaments] every year, they became so special to me,” she says. “And I can’t wait to share that with my kids one day, but I love sharing this with my friends. I love entertaining, I love hosting, and so these decorations get used really well.”\n\n2024 Helen Frankenthaler Foundation, Inc. / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-item=\"{\u0026#34;dangerousHed\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;10 Office Chairs on Amazon That Have Your Back (and Your Glutes)\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;index\u0026#34;:10,\u0026#34;contentType\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;venue\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;hotelLink\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.architecturaldigest.com/best-office-chairs-on-amazon#intcid=_architectural-digest-article-bottom-recirc_6c9a871b-6896-4a1d-9cc6-6d6ea0072677_roberta-similarity1\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;GridFourColumns\u0026#34;}\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ca data-component-type=\"recirc-river\" data-recirc-id=\"item-hed-11\" data-recirc-pattern=\"summary-item\" href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/best-office-chairs-on-amazon#intcid=_architectural-digest-article-bottom-recirc_6c9a871b-6896-4a1d-9cc6-6d6ea0072677_roberta-similarity1\" target=\"_self\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"ClampWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e10 Office Chairs on Amazon That Have Your Back (and Your Glutes)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom budget-friendly models to an all-around ergonomic Herman Miller option\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-item=\"{\u0026#34;dangerousHed\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;We Tested Dozens of Mattresses in a Box for All Sorts of Sleepers\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;index\u0026#34;:11,\u0026#34;contentType\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;venue\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;hotelLink\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-mattress-in-a-box#intcid=_architectural-digest-article-bottom-recirc_6c9a871b-6896-4a1d-9cc6-6d6ea0072677_roberta-similarity1\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;GridFourColumns\u0026#34;}\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ca data-component-type=\"recirc-river\" data-recirc-id=\"item-hed-12\" data-recirc-pattern=\"summary-item\" href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-mattress-in-a-box#intcid=_architectural-digest-article-bottom-recirc_6c9a871b-6896-4a1d-9cc6-6d6ea0072677_roberta-similarity1\" target=\"_self\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"ClampWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe Tested Dozens of Mattresses in a Box for All Sorts of Sleepers\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese are our absolute favorites along the spectrum of very firm to very squishy\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
