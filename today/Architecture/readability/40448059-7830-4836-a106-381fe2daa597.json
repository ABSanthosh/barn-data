  "text": "Perched on the slopes of East Gros Ventre Butte, Ridge 52 Residence by Ward + Blake Architects is a modern mountain home that doesn’t just sit in its surroundings, it appears to grow out of them. Designed with strict height restrictions in mind, the house doesn’t rise above the ridge, but instead folds into it, taking full advantage of sweeping views of Wyoming’s iconic mountain ranges. From its sod-covered rooflines to its buried garage, everything about this home whispers harmony with the land. At first glance, it’s the roof that catches your eye, not because it stands out, but because it blends in. The low-slung shed roofs are covered in sod, reducing visual impact from neighbors uphill while helping manage stormwater. From above, it looks like part of the hillside. From below, the standing seam metal roofs gently angle skyward, framing views of the mountains beyond and shielding outdoor terraces from sun and snow alike. At night, the house glows softly against the hillside, its warm interior light spilling through expansive windows and casting a gentle glow onto the surrounding landscape. From a distance, it feels almost like a quiet lantern tucked into the slope. Inside, the design continues its quiet conversation with nature. Thoughtful openings draw the outdoors in, allowing light and landscape to shape the daily experience of moving through the home, while the open plan makes it easy to transition between the living room, dining area, and kitchen. Sunlight floods deep into the structure, warming the floors beneath your feet, a passive solar strategy that not only brings comfort during long winters, but also boosts energy efficiency. The home’s rugged material palette, weathered wood, rusted steel, stone, and sod, nods to Wyoming’s frontier roots, with the finishes flowing from exterior to interior without pause. The design channels the character of old “soddy” cabins and working ranch structures, but elevates them through a refined and contemporary lens. The exposed wood beams overhead lend a cozy sense of structure for the open plan interior, while soft textures in the rug and sectional invite you to sink in and stay awhile. Earth-toned pillows and sleek, sculptural chairs add just the right touch of contrast, while the fireplace, wrapped in stone and steel, creates a look that’s both grounded and modern. Throughout the home, like in spaces the staircase and hallway, expansive windows are thoughtfully positioned to frame panoramic views of the surrounding mountain ranges. Corner windows frame the golden grasses and distant, snow-capped peaks, turning the view of this bedroom into a quiet, ever-changing backdrop. Crisp white bedding and soft textures keep the room light and serene, while details of exposed steel add a refined, modern edge. In another bedroom, stone walls add texture and weight, grounding the space in the surrounding terrain, while a muted palette of soft grays and creams keeps the atmosphere calm and understated. Layers of natural fabric and a plush rug underfoot invite stillness, and a simple armchair by the window offers a quiet spot to take in the view. Bathed in natural light and framed by views of the surrounding peaks, this bathroom has a sculptural stone tub that anchors the space, offering a place to pause and soak in both water and landscape. The floating vanity, made from richly veined stone, adds a sense of understated luxury. In another bathroom, bold simplicity has been paired with a warm, organic style. The wood vanity brings a rich, grounded presence to the room. Wall-mounted mirrors and soft-glow sconces add just the right touch of refinement, while floor-to-ceiling tile in earthy gray tones ties it all together. The walk-in shower, with its frameless glass and picture-perfect window, offers a view that turns a daily ritual into something quietly luxurious. Every detail, from the sod roofs to the carefully framed views, celebrates its place on the Wyoming hillside. This residence embraces the landscape with respect and intention, blending tradition with modern living. It offers a serene retreat where architecture and nature come together seamlessly, creating a home that feels both grounded and timeless. Photography by Alan Blakely",
