Think back to those deer-in-headlights moments when you blanched at basic prompts like “Tell me about yourself” or the dreaded: “Do you have any questions?” The truth is we all want to nail it on a job interview, but sometimes things don’t always go as planned. Nerves, of course, are one thing, but there are measures you can take to be better prepared—and by extension, more confident—the next time you go in for a face-to-face chat. Below, top designers share their best interview tips and reveal the blunders prospective hires have made in the past (hint: never address Jamie Drake as “Ms.”) to help make sure your next sit-down keeps them entertained and lands you your dream job.Interview tips before you arrive…You were late.This might sound pretty basic, but being late to an interview gets the whole thing off to a bad start. The impression on the interviewer is that you aren’t well prepared and didn’t leave enough time to get to the interview. —Virginia Toledo, Toledo GellerYou didn’t dress for success.I’d like to think I run a pretty stylish firm, and my staff usually dresses in clothing with clean lines and looks professional. I am turned off when a candidate is over-dressed or particularly underdressed for an interview. It shows me that they didn’t take time to research our office culture, and a simple phone call in advance would get them the information they need. —Gonzalo Bueno, X+IIIYou went with a form résumé…If you are an aspiring designer, your résumé had better reflect an intentional, graphic point of view with clarity, style, and a spatial arrangement that is complete and sophisticated. When we see a résumé that looks like you could be applying to be an assistant plumber, it almost always gets tossed out. —Jamie Bush, Jamie Bush + Co.Join NowAD PRO members enjoy exclusive benefits.

Call me old-school, but an applicant of any age should not assume potential employers have memorized his or her credentials! —Nick Olsen, Nick Olsen Inc.You didn’t do your research.There’s one mistake I’ve come across many times over the years: Employment candidates will send a letter enthusing rapturously about their love of our work and how I am their design idol. But they trip up when they get the company name wrong or address me as “Ms. Jamie.” This tells me they don’t really know the firm or me well at all. —Jamie Drake, Drake/AndersonWe are often presented with large portfolios that are redundant or off topic. We suggest a candidate research the firm’s body of work and edit their portfolio presentations accordingly. When in doubt, leave it out. —Thad Hayes, Thad Hayes, Inc.I have interviewed prospective interns who have no idea who Bunny is or what our firm does. They were interested in the position because someone told them they should get an internship with us, and it would be good for their résumé. This is a big no-no. No one wants gushing or brown-nosing, but some knowledge of what you are walking into is key. —Elizabeth Lawrence, Williams LawrenceYou lied.I once interviewed someone who completely falsified their skillset. I asked them to do a drawing test, and it turned out that they didn’t have the skills they purported to have. You can only fake it for so long. Never pretend you’re someone you’re not. —Jeff DeGraw, DeGraw and DeHaan ArchitectsAnd During the ChatYou’re too detail-oriented.The biggest mistake I’ve witnessed repeatedly: candidates who spend way too much time walking us through every tiny detail of their portfolios. It feels like it goes on forever. —Lauren Buxbaum Gordon, Nate Berkus AssociatesYou didn’t ask questions.At the end of every interview I ask candidates if they have any questions and appreciate when someone has insightful ones, not just what time they can take lunch. —Elizabeth Lawrence, Williams LawrenceYou forgot the basic rules of human interaction.Eye contact is essential. I always prefer someone who appears calm and confident. —Alex Papachristidis, Alex Papachristidis InteriorsFresh out of design school? In the middle of a career change? We quiz industry insiders on how to best present yourselfI pay attention to the small stuff—it tends to amplify on a day-to-day level. It could be a handshake or a perfume [choice]. I don’t want to say that it breaks getting a job in my office, but it [could be] a signifier for compatibility—and if we are compatible, chances are we are going to work well together. —Miles Redd, Redd KaihoiYou missed the memo.There is always a technical aptitude I am looking for a candidate to possess, but beyond that, and perhaps even more importantly, I very much pay attention to communication skills and a candidate’s ability to quickly think on his/her feet. A large part of what we do as designers is problem-solve, so I really want to understand a candidate’s agility. —Maureen Ursino, Ursino InteriorsYou’re just copycatting.We look for individuality that will become a great addition to our team. We receive so many inquiries where the prospective hire says they want to “be me.” Although flattering, it’s uninspiring. —Alison Rose, Alison Rose New YorkYou kept yourself under wraps.I get really excited when a portfolio has photos of the person’s own home or something they had helped work on for a friend or family member. It doesn’t have to be completely finished or professional photos. It’s a nice insight into what they are doing and thinking about for themselves. As a result, you usually learn a lot about them, and sometimes it is just the thing that puts that person ahead of others. —Elizabeth Lawrence, Williams LawrenceLooking to start or advance your interior design career? Here’s your guide to the interior design jobs to look out for—and what they payYou’re not a team player.We look for a certain kind of character in candidates that fits with the distinctive spirit of our studio. Exhibiting basic skills and clear communication are, of course, essential; however, of even greater value is finding talent innately capable of positive contribution to Yabu Pushelberg’s culture of working collaboratively within and between teams, fostering an environment of both learning and teaching. —George Yabu and Glenn Pushelberg, Yabu PushelbergYour focus is too narrow.It’s important for a candidate to be dedicated to design, even obsessed with it. I am impressed when candidates have clearly researched historical furniture designers and have a sense of the various design periods. I want my team to be functional and successful with a project regardless of what style a client desires. —Margaret Naeve Parker, M.NaeveYou didn’t sell yourself.I once interviewed a candidate whose portfolio wasn’t the strongest—the work samples they provided weren’t what we were used to seeing. On paper, they might not have stood out, but as soon as the interview began, their personality took center stage. They were engaging and warm, with a genuine enthusiasm for the role. They didn’t try to overcompensate for their portfolio; instead, they openly acknowledged where they were in their career and shared stories about their journey. We decided to give them a chance, and they ended up exceeding expectations, quickly growing into a strong contributor who brought a fresh perspective and energy to our culture. —Caroll Conway, Hoerr SchaudtAPPLY NOWGrow your business with the AD PRO DirectoryArrow",

As a result, you usually learn a lot about them, and sometimes it is just the thing that puts that person ahead of others. \u003cem\u003e—Elizabeth Lawrence,\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca data-offer-url=\"https://williamslawrence.com/\" data-event-click=\"{\u0026#34;element\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;ExternalLink\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;outgoingURL\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://williamslawrence.com/\u0026#34;}\" href=\"https://williamslawrence.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWilliams Lawrence\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"GenericCallout\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Image may contain: Diagram\" src=\"https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/669adb45d49d9bd4dc3ab688/master/w_775%2Cc_limit/Interior%2520Design%2520Jobs.jpg\" srcset=\"https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/669adb45d49d9bd4dc3ab688/master/w_120,c_limit/Interior%20Design%20Jobs.jpg 120w, https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/669adb45d49d9bd4dc3ab688/master/w_240,c_limit/Interior%20Design%20Jobs.jpg 240w, https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/669adb45d49d9bd4dc3ab688/master/w_320,c_limit/Interior%20Design%20Jobs.jpg 320w, https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/669adb45d49d9bd4dc3ab688/master/w_640,c_limit/Interior%20Design%20Jobs.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"100vw\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eLooking to start or advance your interior design career?

On paper, they might not have stood out, but as soon as the interview began, their personality took center stage. They were engaging and warm, with a genuine enthusiasm for the role. They didn’t try to overcompensate for their portfolio; instead, they openly acknowledged where they were in their career and shared stories about their journey. We decided to give them a chance, and they ended up exceeding expectations, quickly growing into a strong contributor who brought a fresh perspective and energy to our culture. \u003cem\u003e—Caroll Conway,\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/hoerr-schaudt-farm-rhode-island-summer-getaway\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHoerr Schaudt\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"external-link-embed--inline\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca aria-label=\"APPLY NOW\" data-event-click=\"{\u0026#34;element\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;ExternalLink\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;outgoingURL\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.architecturaldigest.com/v2/offers/add202\u0026#34;}\" href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/v2/offers/add202\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAPPLY NOW\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGrow your business with the AD PRO Directory\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg focusable=\"false\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eArrow\u003c/title\u003e\u003cg clip-path=\"url(#a)\"\u003e\u003cpath fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M14.707 8 8.354 1.646l-.708.708L12.793 7.5H1v1h11.793l-5.147 5.146.708.708L14.707 8Z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/g\u003e\u003cdefs\u003e\u003cclipPath id=\"a\"\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M0 0h16v16H0z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/clipPath\u003e\u003c/defs\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ca aria-label=\"APPLY NOW\" data-event-click=\"{\u0026#34;element\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;ExternalLink\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;outgoingURL\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.architecturaldigest.com/v2/offers/add202\u0026#34;}\" href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/v2/offers/add202\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/64b965c22cadf9d478acea1c/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/ADP_logo_white_on_black_1x1.png\" srcset=\"https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/64b965c22cadf9d478acea1c/1:1/w_120,c_limit/ADP_logo_white_on_black_1x1.png 120w\" sizes=\"100vw\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
