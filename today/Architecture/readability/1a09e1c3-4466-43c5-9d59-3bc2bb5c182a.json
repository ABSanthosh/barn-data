  "text": "Gwyneth Paltrow officially has one less home in her portfolio of West Coast properties. The actor and Goop founder sold her longtime Los Angeles manse for $22 million, per the Wall Street Journal.Paltrow’s Brentwood, California, abode, which was left unscathed by surrounding (and still ongoing) wildfires, first hit the market in May 2024 for $29.9 million. She lowered the price to $24.9 million in October before landing on its final list price. The buyer’s identity has not yet been revealed.Paltrow first purchased the home with her ex-husband, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, in 2012 for $9.95 million. After finalizing their divorce in 2015, she retained the property—a 1950s single-story equestrian estate in the Mandeville Canyon community. Following a series of renovations in 2009, the 8,000-square-foot property now features six bedrooms and eight bathrooms. The main house has sky-high ceilings, a professional-grade kitchen, wood-paneled walls, and a built-in outdoor barbecue area. There’s also a one-bedroom guesthouse complete with an office, wine cellar, gym, movie theater, and entertainment room. An extra apartment above a detached two-car garage and a horse stable are situated out back. If the amenities aren’t appealing enough on their own, the property comes with a major A-lister neighbor; Paltrow’s now-former pad sits right next door to rapper Kendrick Lamar, who bought a mansion in the area last year for $40 million.Join NowBecome an AD PRO member for only $25 $20 per month + receive an exclusive toteArrowAs for why she’s leaving the well-appointed dwelling, Paltrow told WSJ last year that her children were getting older and have since moved out.
