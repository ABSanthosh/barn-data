However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.For AD100 star Jeremiah Brent, home is everything (he wrote a whole book about it, after all). That’s why his inaugural line of rugs and throw pillows for Loloi, which launches tomorrow, is inspired by downtown Manhattan—the place where his creative journey began. “It’s really where I started off,” he says. “I'm always thinking of ways to weave New York into a story because it means so much to me.”Each of the four Jeremiah Brent x Loloi rug collections is named for a street in the West Village, the historically artistic neighborhood where Brent launched his career and currently lives with his family. The hand-tufted, wool-and-jute Barrow Collection, for example, features bold, linear motifs that nod to the mix of modern and classical buildings in the area, like the Barrow Street Nursery School. “There's this particular corner that I love—the shadows and the light and the architecture,” Brent says. “Everything's rooted in a memory for me.”The Barrow collection is available in six colorways and a variety of sizes. Courtesy of LoloiThe power-loomed Bleecker Collection, with its warm tones, high-contrast patterns, and subtle distressing, honors “one of the most important streets for our family,” shares Brent. “We're always running up and down it on the weekends.” Meanwhile, the hand-woven wool and cotton Greenwich Collection plays with pile and texture variation to add dimension to solid colors.A hand-knotted, soumak weave construction defines the Perry Collection: a set of four wool-and-cotton rugs available exclusively to trade customers. Brent created these pieces to fill a void in the market that he noticed as an interior designer. “I always try to pull in things that not only inspire me, but also that people need and can't find anywhere,” he explains. “So making these really beautiful, sturdy, thick weaves that have a lot of personality and quality was really important.”Shoppers drawn to the collection’s throw pillows can choose from the Sullivan, Brent’s version of a ticking stripe, the Christopher, which offers a cozy, waffle texture, and more. “Throw pillows are the gateway,” he says. “They’re a really safe way that you can add a lot of personality and not feel like you've necessarily spent your entire paycheck.” Courtesy of LoloiThe collaboration is rounded out by 20 throw pillows, which Brent loves for their ability to encourage individuality. Across all the rugs and pillows, Brent opted for neutral, earthy tones like creamy ivory, warm beige, charcoal gray, and moss green. “The palette, for me, is always based off of nature,” he notes. These versatile hues accomplish his goal of longevity for the collections. “This line is really about investing in something that you're going to have for a long time,” Brent says. “I believe that everything you spend money on needs to mean something.”Jeremiah Brent x Loloi will be available for purchase at www.loloirugs.com, Amazon, and select retailers starting tomorrow at 9 am.",
