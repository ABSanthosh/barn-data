  "text": "If the market’s latest debuts have any lesson to tell, it’s that the design community indeed works better together. From Carlos Mota’s hand-embroidered linens for Loretta Caponi to Ligne Roset’s reeditions of Pierre Guariche furniture, industry brands across categories are coming together to bring thoughtful new offerings to designers’ tool kits. Looking for the latest in furniture, decor, lighting, and beyond? Meet the industry’s latest dynamic duo.John Derian x Astier de Villatte Photography courtesy John DerianJohn Derian x Astier de VillatteAmong decoupage designer and retailer John Derian’s stash of beloved collectibles is 18th-century Dutch and English delftware, a passion taken to new heights by joining forces with Paris ceramics workshop and longtime collaborator Astier de Villatte on a serving platter and array of soup, dinner, and dessert plates. Emblazoned with the likes of a pastoral chinoiserie landscape, cascading blossoms, and gliding herons, the 12 designs range from 6 to 14 inches in diameter, ideal for all dinner party configurations.Carlos Mota x Loretta Caponi Photography courtesy Loretta CaponiCarlos Mota x Loretta CaponiMoody still lifes painted by the Dutch Old Masters were the spark for Natura, one of three collections dreamed up by AD100 talent Carlos Mota for the fabled Florence fashion house Loretta Caponi. The New York designer worked alongside creative director Lucia Caponi and her band of skilled craftspeople, who delicately hand-embroidered vibrant flora, fauna, and fruits onto linen tablecloths, napkins, and placemats, as well as cotton percale bedding, terrycloth towels, cushions, and wool throws. Mota’s other designs include Mobile, distinguished by a pattern of swirling gold, and Lucky Us, a reinterpretation of the auspicious clover sporting regal appliqué borders.Kelly Wearstler x Giobagnara Photography courtesy Kelly WearstlerKelly Wearstler x Giobagnara Photography courtesy Kelly WearstlerKelly Wearstler x GiobagnaraIntimate cocktail soirees are decidedly more stylish with the arrival of Maris, Kelly Wearstler’s barware collection for Italian leather atelier Giobagnara that takes the form of rustic pebbles strewn outside the AD100 Hall of Fame designer’s own Malibu abode. Along with stacking trays, placemats, coasters, and insulated double-chamber ice buckets, there are centerpiece bar carts adorned with well-concealed side drawers and pull-out shelves to hold sleek serving accessories, like ice tongs. Giobagnara’s signature leather harmoniously melds with marbled stone, sandblasted aluminum, and ash and wenge woods.Jamie Bush x Marc Phillips Photography courtesy Marc PhillipsJamie Bush x Marc Phillips Photo: Yoshihiro Makino c/o Marc PhillipsJamie Bush x Marc PhillipsJamie Bush, founder of the eponymous AD100 practice in Los Angeles, continually gravitates to organic materials for his warm interiors, and Field Studies embodies this ethos. Bush’s second assemblage of rugs for Marc Phillips (Topo, evocative of terraced mountain ranges, made its debut in 2014) is based on his own abstract paintings depicting aerial views of weather-beaten agricultural fields. Hand-knotted in Nepal with allo, silk, wool, and hemp fibers, the trifecta of fluid motifs is available in aptly earthy hues including Alfalfa, Barley, and Pepper.Pierce \u0026 Ward x Fame Hardwood Photography courtesy Fame HardwoodPierce \u0026 Ward x Fame HardwoodLast month at the WestEdge Design Fair in Santa Monica, California, Pierce \u0026 Ward unveiled its American Heart Pine capsule for Fame Hardwood. Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, of the Nashville- and Los Angeles–based AD100 firm, share an affinity for characterful rooms, and the bespoke flooring, which swaths Ward’s own charming Bolinas, California, residence (shown above), delivers with rich, inviting patinas finished in hard wax oil. Sourced from responsibly managed forests and sanded and stained by hand, the pine, whether honeyed Buddy or pale gold Herringbone, infuses spaces with soul.NeKeia McSwain x Ngala Trading Photography courtesy Ngala TradingNeKeia McSwain x Ngala TradingOn a memorable trip to South Africa with the Ngala Trading team, NeKeia McSwain, principal designer of Denver studio NeKeia + Co., met the proficient artisans who would bring the NeKeia Collection 2.0 to life through materials like hair on hide and gleaming brass. The sequel to her 2021 lighting range for the African furniture and home decor destination, the collection comprises the three-tier tasseled Gwen chandelier; the swiveling, fringe-skirted Nerissa chair; and the undulating Nkova mirror that mimics South Africa’s rivers with leather-trimmed edges; among other pieces sustainably made in Johannesburg.Pierre Guariche x Ligne Roset Photography courtesy Ligne RosetPierre Guariche x Ligne RosetPoring over Pierre Guariche’s archive, the designers at Ligne Roset became enamored with the midcentury French designer’s timeless creations, some of which the furniture company has now reissued as part of its expansive catalog. Consider the sinuous upholstered Vallée Blanche chaise longue Guariche hatched for the La Plagne ski resort in the French Alps in 1963, or the high-backed, spinning Jupiter armchair from 1966 anchored by a lacquered steel base. They join the equally fresh 1953 G10 love seat flanked by molded plywood armrests and a 1952 bookcase outfitted with laminated glass shelves that look right at home in contemporary settings.Justine Kegels x Silestone Photography courtesy CosentinoJustine Kegels x Silestone XM by CosentinoTo kick off Cosentino’s Le Chic Bohème collection and commemorate the 40th anniversary of Modupoint architectural luminaires from Belgium’s Modular Lighting Instruments, Justine Kegels has conceived a series of sculptural coffee and side tables ripe for hospitality environments. The Antwerp-based designer behind JJ Studio and footwear label Odare played with two of Le Chic Bohème’s four colorways (Blanc Elysée and Château Brown), highlighting their graceful gold, copper, gray, pink, and bronze veining in layered, polished slabs that incorporate Modupoint’s new orb-shaped panel mount fixtures.APPLY NOWGrow your business with the AD PRO DirectoryArrow",
