  "text": "Madriguera Eco Reserve Stays merge architecture with natureMadriguera Eco Reserve Stays by S-AR is the first built component of Glampeer, a hospitality initiative that aims to integrate architecture into mountain-based nature tourism. Located within a forested area that opens onto a small valley in Sierra de Arteaga, Mexico, the project explores how built structures can frame and enhance the experience of the surrounding landscape.This initial phase comprises two separate cabins, Cabaña Conejos and Cabaña Liebre, each designed with distinct spatial programs but unified by a consistent material palette including wood, concrete, steel, and glass. Positioned along the western edge of the site’s natural slope, both cabins are oriented to maximize views toward a nearby mountain range. Their siting leverages the terrain for unobstructed visual access to both the valley and the forested backdrop.all images by Recording ArchitectureS-AR Sets Cabaña Conejos and Cabaña Liebre on a forested slopeCabaña Liebre is compact in scale, roughly equivalent to a standard tent footprint, yet incorporates full interior amenities including a bathroom and kitchen. The structure employs a hybrid system of concrete supports and steel framing, enclosed with thermally insulated wooden boards. A concrete volume containing the bathroom and storage is inserted into the larger wooden shell. A surrounding terrace provides exterior space, adaptable for temporary features such as a portable fireplace. Cabaña Conejos, the larger of the two, accommodates multiple functions including sleeping, cooking, dining, and living, with the capacity to adapt interior configurations based on occupancy needs. The building is constructed using load-bearing concrete block walls and lightweight concrete slab systems, clad externally with thermally insulated black-painted wooden boards. Interior surfaces include wood flooring with a natural finish and walls coated with a cement and black paint mixture. Additional features include a workspace, a balcony, a rooftop viewing platform, and multiple access terraces.Both structures operate as contemporary interpretations of the mountain refuge typology, using material economy and structural clarity to establish a visual and spatial dialogue with their environment.
