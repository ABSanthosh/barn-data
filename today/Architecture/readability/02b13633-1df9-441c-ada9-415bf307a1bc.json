The Kansas City Chiefs starting quarterback is just 29 years old and already one of the greatest athletes of his generation. The son of professional baseball player Pat Mahomes Sr., the Texas Tech Red Raider was recruited by Major League Baseball team the Detroit Tigers before he even began concurrently playing college-level baseball and football. The phenom eventually dropped baseball to concentrate on football, and was picked up by the Kansas City Chiefs as the tenth NFL draft pick in 2017. By 24, Mahomes had won his first Super Bowl. He then went on to earn his second and third rings, consecutively, by the ages of 27 and 28, all with the Chiefs. In 2020, a year after their first Super Bowl win in 50 years, the Kansas City Chiefs extended Mahomes’s time on the team to a total of 10 years with a $503 million payout, the highest salary and longest contract of any American athlete, ever.Many sports pundits have compared Mahomes to Tom Brady in terms of greatness—and even Mahomes has weighed in. “I’m trying to catch Tom, but Tom’s a long ways away,” the athlete once told Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer. So where does Patrick Mahomes live? If he follows in Tom Brady’s footsteps when he’s off the field, Mahomes may just end up with as hefty a real estate portfolio as the newly retired football great. Here, we take a look at the properties Mahomes has owned so far. No doubt there’ll be a lot more to come.The starter homeAn aerial view of Kansas City, Missouri. Photo: Allan Baxter / Getty Images2017 was the year Mahomes began his professional career, so it makes sense that it would also be the year he bought his first piece of real estate. The quarterback’s starter home was a 1,800-square-foot penthouse in a building that was conveniently close to his workplace, the Arrowhead Stadium, in downtown Kansas City. The Kansas City Star reports that he paid $307,000 for the pad, although Zillow lists a pending sale of $475,000. A contemporary space, the residence boasts hardwood floors and recessed lighting throughout. There is a wood-burning fireplace in the living room and in the main bedroom, and Mahomes’s unit is the only one to sport three outdoor terraces, including a roof deck. Mahomes listed the condo for sale in 2019 but could not find a buyer, so he withdrew it from the market. In July of 2023, the two-time Super Bowl MVP put the penthouse back on the market for $550,000. By October, according to Zillow, the unit had been sold for an undisclosed amount.SuburbiaIn 2018, less than two years into his professional career and right before he led the Kansas City Chiefs to their first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years (and his first Super Bowl win), Mahomes upgraded his home to a $1.8 million mansion located just a 20-minute drive from Arrowhead Stadium. Set on 1.4 acres of land in a Kansas City suburb, the 4,300-square-foot three-bedroom, four-bathroom abode had all the trappings of a luxury home, and then some. Mahomes and his then girlfriend (now wife) renovated the 1953 build, which had an open floor plan with a modern eat-in kitchen that flowed into a family room featuring a fireplace. There was also a wet bar, a 500-bottle wine room, office space, a sun porch, patio, a pool with a spa, a rose garden, an expansive lawn, and even a miniature putting green. The manse also came with an unusually large 1,250-square-foot main bedroom with a fireplace. The true highlight of the massive space, however, was Mahomes’s shoe room. “That has been something that I’ve wanted for the last six, seven years at least,” Mahomes told Bleacher Report in a video unveiling of the room. At the time, Mahomes (who has a menswear collection with Adidas) owned 180 pairs of shoes, so the couple transformed a section of the massive room into a boutique-style closet just for the sneakerhead’s footwear and sunglasses. The couple listed the upgraded historic property for $2.9 million in June of 2023; it quickly sold less than a month later.The dream estatePatrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany Mahomes, share two children, daughter Sterling, 2, and son Bronze, 9 months. The couple announced in July that baby number three is on the way. Photo: JC Olivera/Getty ImagesIn September of 2020, Mahomes bought a vacant eight-acre parcel of land in Belton, Missouri, a town about half an hour’s drive from Kansas City. The property was listed at $400,000, but records do not show the final price paid by Mahomes. Last summer, the father of two moved his family into a completed compound built from the ground up on the previously vacant land. “I actually decided to get the land, to get ready to build that right when I signed my contract here in Kansas City,” Mahomes said in the Netflix docuseries Quarterback. “I knew I wanted to be here [in Kansas City]. So when I did that, I was like, ‘I’mma be here, I might as well build the exact house I want.’” And what Mahomes wanted, Mahomes got. Although the mansion’s exact square footage is not yet known, aerial shots of the compound reveal a rambling palatial residence, filled with signature features built especially for the athletically inclined family. On the grounds are a 50-yard football field with a soccer net (both Mahomes and his wife Brittany are co-owners of the Kansas City’s soccer team, the Kansas City Current) custom stamped with the three-time Super Bowl MVP’s personal logo in the middle and the family’s last name in the end zone, a pool with a swim-up bar, a firepit, pond, and a par-three golf hole, where he’ll most likely practice for the celeb golf tournaments in which he participates during the off-season.Interior highlights include a gym; an indoor basketball court, which was transformed into a full-on field filled with football-themed party paraphernalia and picnic areas for son Bronze’s first birthday party; a built-in case where Mahomes displays his numerous trophies; an enormous built-in fish tank and full bar in their reception room; an all-black movie theater adorned with the champ’s numbered jerseys and cleats; and Mahomes’s massive, all-black boutique-style walk-in closet, hopefully large enough to fit his colossal shoe collection. “Finally we’re gonna have a home that we built and has everything we could have ever dreamed of having,” Brittany said in the docuseries before the home was completed.The Texas manorMaking sure he stays close to his roots, Mahomes also bought a four-bedroom, seven-bathroom Texas manor in 2020, and it has become the place where he usually spends his off-season months. The native Texan bought the 7,800-square-foot manse from the estate of the late Andrew Gissinger III, a professional football player turned COO turned private equity fund manager. Mahomes’s stellar negotiating skills shone again as he was able to get the property at $3.37 million despite a listing price of $4.26 million. Designed in a modern farmhouse style, the home’s interiors are thoroughly contemporary. Soaring double-height ceilings abound and the home’s general palette is a soft white and ash gray, with subtle touches of blue. Highlights of the home include a floating staircase, wine room, wet bar, and game room. With unobstructed views of the Vaquero golf course, many of the rooms face the picturesque scenery and open up to a loggia that runs the length of the house. Once outside, you’ll find numerous lounging areas, an infinity pool with a spa, an outdoor grill, and a fire pit. The home is estimated to be worth $5.5 million.",
