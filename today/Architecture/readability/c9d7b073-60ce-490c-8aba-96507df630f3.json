Here’s how to narrow down your choices:Responsiveness and BounceResponsiveness, or how quickly a mattress adapts to your movement on top of the bed, is one of the biggest factors combination sleepers should consider. Innerspring and hybrid beds, which both have coil systems, will generate the most bounce, as will naturally bouncy latex beds. An all-foam bed may be tougher to change sleeping positions on—particularly if it’s softer—simply due to its squishiness and slow-moving feel.FirmnessA bed with a medium-firm feel is generally a safe choice for combination sleepers. This crowd-pleasing firmness will be firm enough to keep your hips and low back lifted while stomach and back sleeping, but soft enough to make side sleeping comfortable without pressure buildup along the sensitive shoulder area. Still, firmness is subjective, so branch into softer or firmer territories if that level of firmness ultimately feels the most comfortable for you.MaterialsThe materials used in a mattress can make a big difference in your sleep experience. Hot sleepers will want to look for breathable materials like cotton and aerated foams. A hybrid or innerspring bed with coils that help push air throughout a mattress can also keep hot sleepers cool. Latex is another excellent choice for people with sensitive skin or allergies, since latex is hypoallergenic and also naturally cooling. Likewise, bouncier materials (like coils and latex) can also boost a bed’s responsiveness, making it easier to move around on.Edge SupportEdge support is essentially how well the perimeter of a bed holds up to sitting or sleeping. Sleepers who curl up along the edges of the bed or people with mobility issues who might struggle to get in and out of bed will want to prioritize edge support. A bed lacking edge support will sag when sitting or laying on it, which can make it tough to get out of bed (or even make it feel like you’re going to roll off).Pressure ReliefContouring memory foam and zoned support can help generate pressure relief for sensitive joints like the shoulders and hips. Coil systems are also designed to evenly distribute your body weight throughout the bed, which helps create balanced pressure relief. People with sore joints should prioritize beds with good pressure relief.Combination sleepers might find one mattress type more comfortable than another depending on their sleep style and preferences. Here are the best types of mattresses for combination sleepers:InnerspringInnerspring mattresses are the most responsive thanks to their springy coil systems. These beds may be the easiest to change sleeping positions on, but they are usually much firmer than their hybrid or foam counterparts. Side sleepers opting for an innerspring bed will want to look for a bed with a plush pillow top, which can help cradle the shoulders and add a touch of softness.HybridA hybrid mattress blends the best of both worlds by combining bouncy coils with cushioning foam. You get responsiveness from the inner coils, as well as pressure relief from the foam layers.LatexA latex mattress can be an excellent choice for combination sleepers who run hot. Latex is a naturally cooling material, and latex beds are very bouncy and easy to move around on. However, they tend to be more expensive than other mattress types.FoamA foam bed may be tougher to move around on, and, when soft, can leave some combination sleepers feeling stuck. But that doesn’t mean all foams are out of the question. Those who don’t want to sacrifice feeling cradled by their bed should look for firmer foam mattresses that don’t sink as much under weight. They should also avoid soft memory foam beds. On the flipside, foam beds excel at absorbing movement, making them a great choice for couples or those who share a bed with a pet.FAQsWhat mattress firmness is best for combination sleepers?Medium-firm mattresses can work for all three primary sleeping positions. Back and stomach sleepers can get enough firmness to keep their hips and low back supported, while side sleepers are cushioned around their shoulders and other sensitive joints.What is the best pillow for combination sleepers?This depends on your primary sleeping positions. Most stomach sleepers need a lower loft pillow (under three inches tall), and some don’t use a pillow at all. Side sleepers need more height to support the head and neck (typically at least four inches). If you rotate between stomach and side sleeping, a low loft pillow that can be scrunched up while on your side works best. A medium-loft pillow could also work, depending on how long you stay on your stomach. Back sleepers are more versatile, since they can use a pillow that’s almost any height as long as it keeps their head and neck aligned with the rest of the spine.Is memory foam good for combination sleepers?Memory foam isn’t known for having the best responsiveness due to its slow-moving feel, which can leave some combination sleepers feeling stuck when trying to change sleeping positions. Combination sleepers may find a bouncier hybrid bed easier to move around on.What is the best sleeping position?There’s no one best universal sleeping position. Instead, the best sleeping position for you will depend on your age, lifestyle, preferences, and health. Stomach sleeping, for instance, can reduce snoring or sleep apnea, while side sleeping can help support pregnant individuals or those with respiratory issues. Back sleeping, meanwhile, is often considered best for back pain.",
