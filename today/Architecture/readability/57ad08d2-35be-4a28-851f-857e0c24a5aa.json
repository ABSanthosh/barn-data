However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Richard Peduzzi is evidence that 82-year-olds can still be multifaceted revolutionaries. It became apparent early on that the Frenchman’s love of life would not be one-dimensional. He’s polyamorous, if you will: He initially studied at a drawing academy in Paris, but then decided to devote himself to painting. However, he soon grew tired of standing at an easel and chose set design as his medium. “It requires drawing skills, reading, listening to music, and keeping my eyes open to the world,” he says.Peduzzi has created countless spaces for theater, opera, and film; perhaps the most famous in Germany to this day are the sets for the 1976 Bayreuth Festival’s Ring of the Century. Peduzzi was just 33 at the time and the opera’s director, Patrice Chéreau, was even younger, then 31 years old; the duo’s unconventional staging led to a leaflet campaign against it, petitions, and even physical fights. It takes guts and deep trust to entrust such a man with a typical Viennese apartment in a Neo-Baroque landmark (the courageous client is an opera lover, art collector, and long-time acquaintance of Peduzzi who prefers to remain anonymous).Richard Peduzzi stands here in front of Haus von Innen (House from the Inside), 2013, by Miriam Cahn and a black-and-white painting, Peninsula, 2020, by Sarah Crowner, an artist based in New York. The dreamy wall landscape in the salon is by Jongsuk Yoon; the South Korean artist created a huge mural, Kumgangsan (Diamant Mountain), for Vienna’s Mumok last year. Peduzzi is not the type to settle with discreetly weaving in a bit of modernity under historic stucco ceilings while subtly modifying a traditional floor plan. Instead he will remove walls, floors, and an apartment’s decorative details as he completely reimagines a space.From the oval salon, if you go to the right, you reach the kitchen and some other functional spaces. Head to the left and a double door leads into the dining room, and from there into the living room. Together, these more public areas are almost 1,400 square feet and form a wonderful enfilade. The salon serves as the central hinge of the layout. Its serene round shape exemplifies what characterizes the apartment: First of all, there are the sweeping, huge chandeliers, custom-made from brass, while discreet ceiling rail lighting creates different lighting moods, just like in a theater. Then there is the new elegant oak parquet flooring. All the rooms have different patterns while small ceramic inlays provide bold splashes of color.Pastel tones (all colors are from Argile) are used in the oval salon where there are marquetry chairs and an intimate round table, whose shape is repeated in the chandelier above it and in the Mikado carpet designed by Peduzzi. Models of the custom furniture are displayed on the bar. Next to the door hangs a piece by Friedensreich Hundertwasser, and above it is a work by artist Miriam Cahn, who was awarded the Goslar Kaiserring award in 2024. The sofa with a harlequin pattern follows the curved wall of the oval salon and it is complemented by the window valances, which evoke knightly tournaments from Technicolor films. All the furniture was made by French manufacturers. There are also pastel shades (including stripes and patterns on the furniture and fabrics) that subtly project their colors onto the walls. “The color concept forms a kind of gentle path through the apartment; I developed it with my daughter Antonine.” And, last but not least, some of the furniture and carpets that characterize the interiors are also included in the collections of the Mobilier National, a huge collection of furniture used for France’s government buildings and found in its museums from the 17th century to the present day. “I received my first commission from the Mobilier National in 1989, followed by around 30 more, including creating seating for the Louvre.”In the dining room, a huge brass chandelier floats above the specially designed oak ensemble used for larger dinners. The chandelier uses candles (which requires some acrobatic maneuvers to install and light). As with his stage sets, Peduzzi attaches great importance on atmospheric lighting. Works by Sean Scully flank the double doors into the oval salon. Geometry in the family room: The view of the courtyard is concealed by a delicate curtain and behind it are 15 panes of colored glass, the tones of which are reflected in the parquet inlays. Peduzzi’s Pyramid table was designed in 1992 and is made of oak on a metal structure. The chairs celebrate geometric shapes—rhombuses, rectangles, squares, and polyhedrons. The carafe and glasses were designed in 1914 by Josef Hoffmann for Lobmeyr. An oak table on a metal structure consists of two balancing pyramids and seating made of wood or iron celebrate the rhombus, rectangle, square, and polyhedron. The effect is very postmodern. Peduzzi’s large carpets, in turn, are reminiscent of the brightly colored painting geometries of Paul Klee or the Fauvist Alfred Marquet. Now they enter into a dialogue with the owner’s enormous works of art.Peduzzi designed the huge custom hexagonal tiles for the kitchen; their delicate green is intended to be reminiscent of the color of young plants. The Viennese apartment took four years, with the structural and technical work alone taking 12 months; Peduzzi checked in on the progress every two weeks. As the director of the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris and the Villa Medici Academy in Rome for many years and as a set designer in demand around the world, dropping into the city twice a month was nothing new.Peduzzi also designed the tiles in the bathroom.",
