  "text": "The Curved House Responds to surrounding Terrain in AlteaLocated on a sloped plot in Altea, Spain, The Curved House by Ramón Gandía Brull SLP – RGB Arquitectos responds to topography and orientation through a distinctive curvilinear form. The project is positioned at the upper part of a mountainous residential development, where the site reveals itself gradually along a winding access road. This approach sequence informed the house’s formal strategy. Its curved exterior is shaped to align with the topography and to minimize visual mass from the street, despite its substantial 47-meter-long sea-facing facade.The residence is composed of three levels, each serving distinct functions. The basement level contains the garage and service areas, the first floor includes bedrooms for children and guests as well as a gym and spa, while the uppermost floor houses the primary living spaces, kitchen, pool, and master suite. Internally, all three floors are organized using rectilinear plans to optimize spatial efficiency and layout clarity. While the internal layout remains orthogonal, the exterior shell introduces curvature to modulate the building’s appearance and to establish a gradual, immersive arrival experience. Large cantilevered terraces, including a 21-meter pool with a 6-meter overhang, extend from the structure to provide covered outdoor spaces and to reduce the building’s perceived bulk. A triple-height entrance lobby marks the transition from exterior to interior, enhancing spatial legibility.all images by Mayte PieraMaterial and Linear Lighting Emphasize the Home’s CurvatureThe material palette reflects regional building traditions and climatic considerations. Exterior walls are finished in a white multilayer coating, referencing Mediterranean typologies. Expanses of glazing with graphite-colored frames are set back beneath the curving slabs, accentuating the horizontal planes and cantilevered geometry. Interior finishes reinforce the architectural language through custom millwork with curved profiles, combining white lacquer and dynamic-grained natural wood. Large-format porcelain panels define bathroom volumes and spa areas, while neutral-toned flooring establishes continuity throughout. For the lighting design, the architectural team at Ramón Gandía Brull SLP – RGB Arquitectos maintains the house’s themes of movement and sectional layering.
