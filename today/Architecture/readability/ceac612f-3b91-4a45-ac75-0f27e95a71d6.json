However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.One might assume that Mark Zuckerberg’s houses consist primarily of sleek Silicon Valley mansions. That’s not wrong—the Facebook (now known as Meta) founder does own a compound not far from his office—but as his fortune has grown over the years, so has his real estate portfolio, encompassing additional properties in California as well as a much-talked-about Hawaiian compound. The world’s third richest man, according to Forbes, Zuckerberg ranks just behind Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and boasts a net worth of around $214 billion.In classic Zuckerberg fashion, every house he owns is massive, considerably upgraded, and oftentimes saddled with complaints from the general public. Furthermore, Zuckerberg has been known to buy up neighboring homes to make sure that he and his family have the utmost privacy. Below, we recap all the places the Zuck, his wife, Priscilla Chan, and their two young children now call home.Tricked-out Palo Alto compoundAbout a year before he and Chan said “I do” in 2012, Zuckerberg set down roots in Palo Alto with the purchase of a 5,617-square-foot home just a short 10-minute drive from Facebook’s Menlo Park campus. The tech maven reportedly paid $7 million for the five-bedroom, five-bathroom mansion, and then paid a pretty penny to have it outfitted with some nifty technological upgrades, including a “custom-made artificially intelligent assistant” called Jarvis, according to CNBC. (Among its tasks: helping Zuckerberg’s daughter with her Mandarin lessons, identifying visitors at the door, and supplying clean gray T-shirts from a rigged-up “T-shirt cannon.”) Other features of the home include a saltwater pool, a glass-enclosed sunroom, and a huge backyard pavilion.The following year, the couple began buying up the four homes surrounding their original Palo Alto house. In all, they reportedly spent an estimated $43 million on those properties. The Wall Street Journal reported that the couple initially leased the homes back to their former owners, with plans to eventually demolish all four to build something new in 2016. The city voted against Zuckerberg’s plans, however, so he had to settle for just renovating two of the four homes in order to create a compound situated on a lot measuring 1.83 acres.San Francisco pied-à-terreIn late 2012, the Facebook founder spent $10 million on a pied-à-terre town house in the Dolores Heights neighborhood of San Francisco, reportedly shelling out an additional $1.8 million to renovate the brick and stucco home. SF Gate reported that renovations included the addition of a first-floor office, a media room, a laundry room, a wine room, and a wet bar. Reportedly, there was also a $65,000 bathroom and kitchen remodel and the addition of a greenhouse on the premises. Not much else is known about the property, except that it presently measures 7,368 square feet. Zuckerberg and Chan sold the place for $31 million in an off-market deal, according to the New York Post, in July of 2022.Kauai, Hawaii, estateZuckerberg began what has now been a years-long love affair with Hawaii in 2014, when he snapped up 707 acres on the island of Kauai for about $116 million. His first purchase, according to local newspaper Garden Island, included most of Pila’a Beach and the Kahu’aina Plantation, and posed an issue for locals who complained about the walls the tech magnate put up around his property, which ultimately blocked beach access. According to the paper, Zuckerberg’s first Hawaii purchase included plans for a 6,100-square-foot main house with a 16-car garage and a structure that would serve as security headquarters for his $23 million security team.Zuckerberg and Chan. Taylor HillThree years later, he and Chan expanded their Hawaiian holdings with the purchase of 89 more acres for $45 million. They once again found themselves in the spotlight after filing lawsuits in order to buy pockets of land on their estate known as the kuleana parcels. These parcels were given to native Hawaiian tenant farmers in 1850 and were considered sacred to the generations who had owned them since. Zuckerberg and Chan backed off after public outcry, but still ended up purchasing 12 of these parcels.In 2021, Zuckerberg and Chan decided to deepen their holdings in Hawaii, spending $53 million for 600 more acres on Kauai. The lot was previously owned by the Waioli Corporation, a local organization that works in conservation efforts, and the couple has been outspoken about their hopes to prioritize preservation efforts with their ever-expansive estate. “We have been working closely with a number of community partners to promote conservation, produce sustainable agriculture, and protect native wildlife at our ranch and in the surrounding areas, and look forward to extending that effort to Lepeuli in the months ahead,” Zuckerberg said in a statement. Their most recent purchase brings their total acres owned in Hawaii up to a reported 1,400.The mogul offered a small glimpse at his Hawaii property on Instagram in January 2024, not long after Wired reported that the Meta CEO was building a $100 million compound complete with a bunker. In his social media post, he poked fun at the report, sharing a video of himself playing video games in a home theater with the caption, “Meanwhile, in the ‘bunker’.…” He also told Bloomberg during an interview, “No, I think that’s just like a little shelter. It’s like a basement.”Lake Tahoe compoundIn 2019, Zuckerberg and Chan quietly purchased two adjoining Lake Tahoe homes for $59 million—the Brushwood Estate and the Carousel Estate—which they combined into a massive compound on the lake’s west shore. (According to The Wall Street Journal, the couple was also contemplating a third purchase, but it remains unknown whether or not they have made moves for that expansion yet.) Photos of the compound are scant, but what is known is that the Carousel Estate features a seven-bedroom main house and sits on three and a half acres, with a marina-style pier ideal for docking a large yacht. And the Brushwood Estate is slightly larger, measuring 6.2 acres, with a six-bedroom main house.Mysterious Woodside, California, propertyWhen the Real Deal reported in March of 2024 that Zuckerberg had parted ways with a 4,800-square-foot dwelling in the town of Woodside, California, it was the first most people had heard of him owning the place. The outlet tied the four-bedroom, four-bathroom house to Zuckerberg via a convoluted web of LLCs and stated that he’d purchased it back in December 2021. The house sold for $29.6 million.",
