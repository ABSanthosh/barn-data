However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Jordan and Ethan Green remember everything about their first visit to what would become their next home: the spectacular ceiling height, the abundance of light, and the oak floors, still in great condition. “There was an aura of calm that we just couldn’t find anywhere else,” says Jordan, a strategy consultant, about the Brooklyn apartment, situated in a prewar building that once served as the headquarters for the Bell Telephone Company. For the couple, who both work long hours, mostly in the office, the space held the promise of a sanctuary where they could catch their breath after an exhausting day.But even in their meditative trance, the Greens, then renting in Manhattan, noticed a few minor drawbacks: The 1,300-square-foot apartment lacked character, and the overall vibe felt somewhat antiseptic—think black hardware, white kitchen cabinets, and subway tiles in the bathroom. “We knew it needed work but we saw a lot of potential,” shares Ethan, a lawyer—so much potential that the couple, first-time homeowners, decided they wanted to start with a completely blank slate. Not a single piece of furniture came with them—a decision fully supported by interior designer Carly Krieger of New York City–based Past Lives Studio, whose work they had admired on Instagram and whom they soon entrusted with the transformation.Before the renovation, the entryway was an awkward 15-foot-long passage. “We saw it as an opportunity to use bold color to open the space up and introduce materials that recur throughout the apartment,” says Krieger, who chose to highlight the lower cabinets with Farrow \u0026 Ball’s Vert De Terre, a shade reminiscent of green onyx. A slab of Calacatta marble was crowned atop the millwork to display vintage treasures, including a sterling silver Christofle vase and a 1940s pewter vessel by GAB Sweden. Satin nickel knobs by Mi\u0026Gei and a series of small ceramic mirrors by Hervé Taquet Ceramique give the space a jewel-box feel. The top priority for Krieger was giving the home a personality. “We wanted to infuse warmth and transform it from what felt like the lobby of a tech startup,” jokes the designer, who remedied the situation with an earthy palette and jewel-toned touches. Mind you, the process didn’t all go according to plan—though, as it turned out, in the best way. “The building was historically landmarked, which meant some features, such as the bronze grilles on the ground floor doorways and the windows in the lobby, had remained intact through the years. Initially, the idea was to use these as a jumping-off point for the apartment design,” recalls Krieger. Only, the idea never made it out of her head. “As we looked through source material and moodboards in the early days of the project, I quickly discovered that Jordan and Ethan shared the same affinity that I do for the Swedish Grace movement,” continues the designer, referring to Sweden’s equivalent of the Art Deco style, with added neoclassical flourishes.Krieger followed no strict rules, drawing inspiration from the colors, motifs, and geometric patterns of the style, while also making a mental detour to 1970s Italy, incorporating waterfall stools in the living room and a travertine table in the dining area. She wasn’t particular about perfection, intentionally choosing unexpected patterns and materials like unlacquered brass, patinated bronze, leather, plaster, burlwood, and seeded glass, to allow the home to develop a patina over time. Krieger took a similar approach with color, opting for earthy tones with hints of terra-cotta, cider, and hazelnut, which she sprinkled throughout the apartment—on shelving, storage, cabinetry, the velvet sectional sofa, and the corduroy bed frame in the bedroom.In the living room, a 1950s Swedish brass table lamp by Sonja Katzin, with an eyelet linen cone shade, glows atop a 1970s burlwood cube side table. To the left, a pair of 1950s waterfall foot stools by Osvaldo Borsani, upholstered in Gucci’s emerald green velvet, squares off the seating area. In another lifetime, Jordan and Ethan might have been born in the early 1900s, given their immediate desire to build a collection of vintage treasures—economically, of course. For every unique find foraged from an antique store, they balanced it with a budget-friendly piece to match. “Carly relied on her experience sourcing from the farthest corners of the internet and online auctions to secure the lighting, art, decorative objects, and many of the furniture pieces in the apartment,” Jordan notes. Beyond beautiful things, the couple wanted the home to feel cozy—for themselves, yes, but also for their shih tzu-poodle, Lola. Krieger delivered with warm textures like velvet, shearling, and wool, as well as ample seating where people and pooch alike could lounge and entertain with ease.Ask Jordan and Ethan if their home lives up to their vision, and the couple nods in unison. “We wanted it to feel highly styled but also inviting, and Carly really helped us strike the right balance,” says Jordan. Lola approves too. “Every time a new upholstered piece arrived, we’d watch her develop a new obsession—but it only lasted until the next seating option was delivered. A chair would arrive, and she’d roll around on it, sitting there all day, wagging her tail in contentment. If we weren’t already excited about our new seating, seeing Lola so happy made it even more fun.” It’s safe to say no one was disappointed.The living room is a sunset sanctuary that mirrors the colors of the skyline throughout the day. Achieving this aesthetic wasn’t easy for Carly. “One thing that ended up being more intricate than I had originally anticipated was finding the right objects for the floating shelves. The ceilings are quite high so I needed to find items that took up enough visual space and were scaled appropriately so the eye was drawn upwards,” she says. She wasn’t afraid to mix metals, using brass, patinated bronze, and sterling silver to create striking vignettes.In the living room, a pair of slim 1950s Swedish Slædestolen BM-2254 chairs by Borge Mogensen bask in the evening afterglow.The kitchen is a soothing vision in white. Krieger painted the walls and ceiling Benjamin Moore’s Cloud White and updated the original black-stained millwork with warm maple veneer. As for the upper cabinets, she whited out the original high-shine vinyl with Benjamin Moore’s Soft Chamois, and added some shiny knobs by Mi\u0026Gei. She chose Calacatta marble for the backsplash and countertops.The dining room storage benches, fronted with maple veneer and softened by custom seat and back cushions—fabricated in Afua fabric by Studio Ashby with olive green velvet piping by Pierre Frey—stand out against the solid-toned periphery.To save time and money, Krieger opted for sand-toned waterproof plaster over the existing subway tiles, creating a rustic hammam-like experience. She also clad the sides of the tub in Calacatta marble for a touch of elegance.",
