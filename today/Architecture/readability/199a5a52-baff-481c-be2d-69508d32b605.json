Photo credit: Qingyan Zhu “Cheaper buildings are not good for the planet and they’re not good for our health, and actually we need to spend a little bit more – but only a little bit – and I think the next few years are about really proving that we can make buildings radically more human for only a little bit more money.” — South China Morning Post \"There is a misunderstanding in construction. People say, 'Oh, it’s more expensive than ever to build buildings' – and that’s not actually true,\" Heatherwick added. \"Relative to the money in society, buildings are cheaper than they’ve ever been – a bit like ultra-processed food […] We didn’t have roads, cranes, lorries in the past; labour is more expensive now, but there are all these other factors.\" The designer goes on to mention his new Xi’an Centre Culture Business District favorably in light of his now two-year-old Humanize campaign, which announced its first-ever academic partnership with Loughborough University in January.",
