The Papaloapan River Linear Park revitalization project by Mexican practice Entorno y Contexto reintegrates the river into the urban fabric, restoring its environmental and social significance. Before intervention, the site suffered from silted waters, informal settlements, and underutilized green spaces.Crucial to the project is a network of pathways connecting open and covered structures that accommodate diverse activities, from running and cycling to theater performances. Four elevated 420-square-meter buildings link the new park to the urban grid, strategically designed to withstand seasonal flooding. Their material palette — brick, concrete, and dark red-painted steel — resonates with the industrial architectural language of Tuxtepec, fostering a sense of familiarity and belonging.all images by Andrés Cedillo / ESPACIOSthe revitalization introduces new spaces for the communityWhile past efforts to activate the area introduced sporadic amenities, they lacked a cohesive vision. Recognizing the need for a comprehensive approach, Entorno y Contexto led an extensive research phase, conducting site mapping and direct community engagement to tailor the park’s program to local needs.
