  "text": "Coastal Art For a forthcoming renovation of the Ogunquit Museum of American Art (OMAA) Kevin Daly Architects (kdA) and landscape architects Reed Hilderbrand are drawing from Maine’s coves and coastal landscape and the rich cultural and art scene of the area. The architecture and landscape designers have teamed up to develop a strategic plan for the museum to update its facilities using sustainable approaches and to reaffirm the connection to the coastline, all while enhancing visitor experience. “Preservation is a key value for our strategic plan. We grow from our past and without it we could lose our connection to the early artist’s communities and our landscape” said executive director of OMAA, Amanda Lahikainen. OMAA’s original building built in 1952 by Charles Worley Jr. (Courtesy Ogunquit Museum of American Art) Originally founded by artist Henry Strater and opened in 1953, OMAA showcases a diverse collection of paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, and photographs spanning from the late 1800s to the present. Displayed works include pieces from historical figures like American painter Charles Woodbury, who was a trailblazer in the Ogunquit art scene. Through its renovation, the architects aim to restore the simplicity of the original design, focusing on harnessing a deeper connection with the waterfront. It also looks to historic elements such as the early 1900s fishing shacks of Perkins Cove. Architect Kevin Daly noted that the distinct roofline and unobstructed ocean views of the original 1952 building, designed by Charles Worley Jr., will inform kdA’s design approach. “As the original building evolved, the relationship to the ocean and the coastal setting that was the inspiration for artists and visitors alike has been cut off,” Daly said. “The site review will be focused on re-establishing a presence on this outcropping and imaging new encounters between visitors and the coast.” Lahikainen listed out the improvements she hopes for in an article published in the Portland Press Herald. These include a community room, accessibility upgrades, and renovated office space for staff. She floated the idea to tear down the 1990s addition, where the permanent collection is now on display, to make room for a new structure that may better meet the needs of the museum. The new additions will contribute and build off of a 2022 addition that installed floor-to-ceiling windows.

Geoff Fritz, an associate principal at Reed Hilderbrand, said in the Portland Press Herald he is looking to improve water management on the site. kdA will lead two in-person public town hall meetings at the museum on November 12 to hear what improvements the community hopes for. OMAA has not shared a timeline for the project.",
