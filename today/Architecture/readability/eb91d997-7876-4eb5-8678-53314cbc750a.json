  "text": "The White House Rose Garden looks different these days. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump announced his intentions to alter elements of the White House’s exterior, including the historic Rose Garden. The New York Times previously reported the president’s plans to remove the plot’s grass and replace it with hardscape—possibly limestone—for a patio and potentially some hardwood floors for dancing. Construction began last month, and new photos reveal that the project is nearing completion. The lawn that has centered the green space since 1961 has been paved over with concrete, separated from the garden’s namesake rose bushes by neatly trimmed shrubs.A photo taken July 23 shows the pavement work in progress at the White Hose Rose Garden lawn. Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe president explained in an interview with Fox’s Laura Ingraham in March that he wanted to give the space, which sits just outside his Oval Office, “a gorgeous stone” patio experience. “You know, we use [the Rose Garden] for press conferences, and it doesn’t work because the people fall…” he said, citing the wet terrain and “women with the high heels, it just didn’t work.” He expressed that “the roses stay…. It’s just the center section” of the garden that would get an overhaul. The Times reported that the makeover is intended “to resemble a patio like the one he has at Mar-a-Lago”—the Palm Beach resort he’s owned since 1985, which is where he tends to hold court with club members. The overhaul, undertaken by the National Park Service, is being funded by the Trust for the National Mall.In June, a White House spokesperson told People that the first couple “have deep respect for the history of the White House and for the Rose Garden” and referred to the project, which is scheduled for a mid-August completion, as a “restoration” that “preserves the beauty of the space and builds on the work done in 2020,” when Melania Trump added a limestone border.Once complete, what might the new Rose Garden look like with this Floridian vision in mind? After the changes were announced in March, we reached out to interior and landscape designers familiar with Mar-a-Lago’s flamboyant aesthetic, along with experts familiar with the horticultural history of roses, to get their take on the news.Why does Trump want to pave over the White House Rose Garden?It may sound extreme to pave over the grass in such a legendary space. Trump reportedly wanted hardscaping on the plot out of concern about foot traffic on the garden’s soft terrain, according to reports from CNN and The New York Times. “All of this foot traffic likely puts a lot of wear and tear on the lawn, so they may be looking for something more durable,” says Kristine Paulus, a contributor to The Rose Book, a text featuring essays exploring the horticultural history of the rose.Vice President Walter Mondale (left) and President Jimmy Carter talk in the shade of the White House Rose Garden in this 1978 photo.

Bell, a landscape architect based in Washington, DC. Bell also works extensively in Palm Beach, Florida, and has a good sense of what the goals and pitfalls are in terms of Trump’s changes to the garden. “Anyone who has walked on spongy turf in formal shoes knows that queasy feeling you get when you’re not sure if you’re going to sink into a soft patch,” Bell says.What is “Mar-a-Lago Style”?A 2015 photo of the tiled patio at Mar-a-Lago Photo: Mary Jordan/The Washington Post via Getty ImagesWe don’t yet know the extent to which Mar-a-Lago’s design aesthetic will inform the Rose Garden’s finished renovations beyond what is referenced by the New York Times report, but according to Miami interior designer and founder of IV Atelier, Irena Viitiuk, Mar-a-Lago–inspired design doesn’t necessarily mean directly replicating the private club and spa’s particular brand of extravagance. Instead, she says, the White House Rose Garden could selectively embrace sophisticated hardscaping techniques like the use of limestone or bluestone, carefully chosen landscaping, and nods to historical motifs.“Mar-a-Lago style” can be thought of as a particular look typically found in high-end Florida estates and private golf clubs. “It’s a blend of Mediterranean revival with hints of Palm Beach, drenched in gold finishes, grand chandeliers, patterned floors, heavy drapery, and plenty of oversized everything,” says Angie Kreller, an interior designer at Yabby. For her, the Mar-a-Lago aesthetic leans maximalist and embraces the theatrical. While it has historical European influences, it is “mashed together in a way that feels more about impact than restraint,” she adds.According to the Times, Trump has also explored the idea of recreating Mar-a-Lago’s ballroom at the White House, a notion that he first pitched when President Barack Obama was in office. No plans have been set in motion for that project, which Trump reportedly said would cost $100 million.Did Trump redesign the White House Rose Garden in his first term?An August 2020 photo of the recently renovated Rose Garden. The project included new limestone walkways. Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesMelania Trump spearheaded a restoration of the White House Rose Garden with landscape architecture firm Oehme, van Sweden during Trump’s first term. The renovations were controversial and drew backlash, leading to a petition that called for the changes to be reversed. Though the limestone border was an unpopular change aesthetically speaking, Melania’s renovation was also intended to improve the garden’s drainage and level of sunlight. The First Lady also added 200 new rose bushes to the 12 remaining original specimens, per People. As Paulus points out, the White House Rose Garden has undergone several renovations since it was originally created in 1903 by first lady Edith Roosevelt. “The first major redesign was by well-known garden designer Rachel ‘Bunny’ Mellon during the Kennedy administration,” says Paulus, who adds that Mellon’s design included the large central grass panel.It’s possible for a largescale redesign to the White House Rose Garden to be successful (and popular), but it would need to be approached with sensitivity to the garden’s historical legacy. The heirloom floral varieties that populate the space speak to its rich backstory. “Cultivars include ‘John F. Kennedy,’ ‘Mister Lincoln,’ ‘Queen Elizabeth,’ ‘Pope John Paul II,’ and ‘Peace,’” says Paulus. Would all this be lost with Trump’s interventions? “From what I understand, the plan is to only change the lawn area of the Rose Garden, not the Rose Garden itself,” Paulus says. “The White House Rose Garden is a horticultural gem and a living cultural artifact. I think most Americans would like to see it preserved as much as possible.”",
