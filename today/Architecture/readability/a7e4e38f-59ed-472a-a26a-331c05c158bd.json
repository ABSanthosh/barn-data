  "text": "This week on Dezeen, we reported that homes designed by Richard Neutra and Ray Kappe were among more than 12,000 structures lost in the Los Angeles wildfires. In the wake of the deadly fires, Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order to allow  \"residents to rapidly rebuild\", while architects and critics called for a development \"rethink\", to ensure that the rebuilding is done in a way that limits further damage. Ryue Nishizawa's Moriyama House was the most significant building of 2005We continued counting down the most significant architecture of the 21st century in our 21st-Century Architecture: 25 Years 25 Buildings series. Among this week's highlights were Ryue Nishizawa's Moriyama House (above), Snøhetta's Oslo Opera House and Elemental's Quinta Monroy housing. Demolition of the first Stirling Prize winner was approved this weekIn the UK, the demolition of the inaugural RIBA Stirling Prize-winner was approved by Salford City Council. The University of Salford's Centenary Building, which was completed in 1995 by Hodder+Partners and won the Stirling Prize in 1996, will now be razed despite an objection from the Twentieth Century Society. We looked at the cute robots unveiled at CESContinuing our coverage of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, we rounded up all of the cute robots that took over this year's event. Other news from the event included the launch of an AI-powered self-watering smart planter and Honda's latest electric prototypes. Walmart carried out a low-key rebrandAlso in the US, Walmart unveiled its latest rebrand, which included a logo that was largely unchanged from its 2008 version. Designed for the brand's \"next chapter\", the new branding is slightly bolder and brighter with the logo's elements moving closer together. A house in a forest in Chile was this week's most popular projectPopular projects on Dezeen this week include a Chilean home surrounded by forest, the conversion of a group of 15th-century farm buildings into housing and a restaurant topped with a \"clod of earth lifted from the ground\". Our latest lookbooks focused on calming home interiors with earthy finishes and listening bars that are easy on the eyes and ears.
