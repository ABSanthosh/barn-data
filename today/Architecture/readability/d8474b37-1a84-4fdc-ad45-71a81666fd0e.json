The architects note that the area has been central to the capital city’s industrial expansion over the past five decades, and describes it as a barren and expansive area that has become a preferred location for factories and manufacturing facilities. The design team, led by architect Davood Boroojeni, has returned to Eshtehard for a second time to realize this new workspace, the process department of the Shamim Polymer Factory.images © Deed Studiodavood boroojeni employs industrial materialsCovering 2,200 square meters, the factory’s process department is designed by Iran’s Davood Boroojeni Office as a pair of asymmetrical and unconventional forms. The architects‘ primary goal was to reflect the concept of optimization through the building’s design, the objective aligning with the factory’s mission, emphasizing spatial efficiency and practicality. The result is a facility that mirrors the function of the process department it houses while enhancing the daily experiences of its workers.A notable feature of the project is its worker-centered approach, integrating the employees’ input into the design process. The building’s walls and ceilings are made of raw iron sheets, which contribute to the industrial atmosphere, while storytelling elements are woven throughout the space to create a dynamic and engaging environment. The design reflects the priorities and preferences of the factory’s workforce, who were actively involved in shaping their work environment.the factory covers 2,200 square meters with asymmetrical formsThoughtful Design for Employee Well-beingTo address the need for designated outdoor break areas, the design includes two courtyard spaces on the east and west sides of the building. These areas provide a practical solution for employees without disrupting the overall work environment. Transparent hatches have been integrated into the walls to create a sense of openness and continuity throughout the building, allowing for better visibility and a more connected workspace. One of the most distinctive aspects of the project is the inclusion of personalized elements, such as a chicken coop, which was suggested by an employee during construction. This thoughtful addition underscores the participatory nature of the design process, lending the creation of a workplace that feels comfortable and familiar, almost like a second home for the employees.raw iron sheets and storytelling elements define the industrial aestheticthe design focuses on optimization to reflect the factory’s functionworkers played an active role in shaping the building’s design",
