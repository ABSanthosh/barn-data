  "text": "Giada Nava remembers playing on the low, wide concrete steps of her parents’ home when she was only six years old—Nava, who is now a young Italian designer, had decided then that they were ideal for rolling down “like a kitten.” At the time, of course, she had no idea how much architectural daring lay behind these stairs. “We moved here in the 1970s,” she says. “For my brother and me, it was just a big three-story house with lots of space to run around in the living room and a huge garden. It had four bedrooms, which were relatively small compared to other rooms and only used for sleeping, along with four bathrooms and an indoor pool that we used a lot.” Schoolmates who visited the 8,611-square-foot home were impressed: They told their parents about a concrete spaceship that had landed in the tranquil greenery of Cusano Milanino, a town just outside Milan.Bruno Gecchelin’s Gesto lamp for Skipper is mounted above a Tecno T69 table. The lounge area in front of the embossed concrete surfaces of the staircase is defined by a Nomade carpet from CC-Tapis. The floor lamp is by Mario Bellini for Flos, the stool by SEM. Building a raw home in a green paradiseHow did the house come about? Nava doesn’t know too much about the history of the project, which her parents began in the early 1970s. Her father worked a lot and was often traveling on business. She found him “not very talkative, almost boring.” In contrast to her quiet father, her mother was an eclectic, cultivated society lady who, after boarding school in Switzerland and a relatively restrained rebellious phase, decided to marry a serious self-made entrepreneur. During one of her soirées with illustrious guests from the worlds of culture and art, she must have introduced her husband to the architect Francesco Castiglioni from Como, some 30 miles north of Milan. He then built the villa for the family on a newly acquired plot of land. Castiglioni also designed the garden and much of the home’s furnishings.The garden of this Brutalist villa near Milan spans almost three-quarters of an acre. It was also designed by architect Francesco Castiglioni. The architect chose reinforced concrete as his building material. In fashion at the time for office buildings and public works, it was an unusual choice for this green garden city. In the midst of the stylistically uniform and colorful Art Nouveau villas of Cusano Milanino, a development from the early 20th century, the home’s angular Brutalist architecture was so striking that neighbors called the villa “the bunker.” For Nava, however, the house with its expanses of glass, its spacious rooms, and its various functions and elements reduced to bare minimal presences, the home evokes different associations. “It is a successful design that feel like a huge loft because there are no unoccupied areas,” she emphasizes.The bedroom features the Roma Squared lamp from Nassi. The bed linens and throw are from Society Limonta. How Nava gave the Brutalist build a faceliftA mother of four, Nava inherited her father’s entrepreneurial spirit. After a long career in the family business, four years ago she took over Exilia, a historic Italian lingerie brand and restarted production while bringing the brand into the present day. She inherited her creative flair and love of beauty from her mother and her uncle, a gallery owner. It is no coincidence that she and her husband are passionate collectors. So, when her father died five years ago, she decided to give the large house a second life. “I freshened it up, repainted it, cleaned the carpets that cover every inch of the floors and had some worn furniture reproduced, based on original sketches we found in some drawers.”After a renovation five years ago, Giada Nava and her family moved back into the house where she grew up. She sits on a sideboard with a high-gloss black lacquer that contrasts elegantly with the rough concrete walls; Francesco Castiglioni designed this and other furniture specifically for this project. The renovation of the house was an investment that pays off two-fold: Nava enjoys the beauty, and has found inspiration for her Exilia collections in it: “The geometries, the colors, everything is a source of ideas for my work.” She points to the home’s unexpected used of glass and concrete—the large living room with its floor-to-ceiling windows trace the asymmetrical silhouette of the rear, garden-facing façade—which inspired the shimmering tulle inserts of her initial Keros swimsuit prototype. The home’s interior and exterior are in a constant dialogue, including with a double-sided fireplace that bridges the two.The sloped window on the front of the villa opens the large living room to the garden. A leather-covered cantilever chair from Zanotta stands in front of Gae Aulenti's Pipistrello lamp. Ceramic works by Rosa Süss (from Common Sense) and Heidi Bjørgan (from Officine Saffi). The 20-meter-long indoor pool of the Brutalist villa near Milan. “This is my favorite corner,” says Nava as she sits down on the steps that lead to an area with a marble table by Angelo Mangiarotti. The console at the entrance is also one of his designs. From there you have access to the kitchen and the staircase that leads to the bedrooms, the swimming pool, and the roof terrace. The fact that the walls are made of rough reinforced concrete does not detract from the familiar warmth of this villa.The marble console in the entrance area dates from the era when the house was built. It is from Angelo Mangiarotti’s Eros collection from the 1970s. On it is a Snoopy lamp by Flos. The vase by Arina Antonova and the red sculpture by Kassandra Widmark Utas are both from Common Sense.
