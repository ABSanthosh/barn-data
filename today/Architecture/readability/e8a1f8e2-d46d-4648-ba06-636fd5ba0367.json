Architects, developers, builders, contractors and fabricators are searching for innovative—and cost-effective—solutions that will enable them to work quickly and safely while still delivering high-quality, sustainable finished projects. One such solution is prefabricated (“prefab”) construction, a method that helps to streamline the building process and produce beautiful results. In commercial building, prefab construction of a building’s façade involves assembling, in a controlled environment, large exterior panels into units. The completed units—which can be larger than 40 feet wide and one story tall—are then transported to the job site. Once on-site, they are connected to the building’s structure. (Courtesy 3A Composites) This method is challenging traditional paradigms in commercial construction, creating value by offering design flexibility, faster project delivery and accelerated project scheduling, quality assurance and reduced risk of jobsite injuries. The building, Union on 24th, paved the way for prefabricated excellence. Located on the campus of the University of Texas, Austin, the student housing highrise showcases the innovative combination of ALUCOBOND® PLUS aluminum composite material (ACM) and prefabrication construction techniques. Developed by Greystar and constructed with prefabricated panels built by Baker Triangle, the project achieved stunning aesthetics, exceptional quality and an accelerated construction schedule.
