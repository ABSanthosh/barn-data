Selected from 624 anonymous entries in an international competition, the designs are poised to anchor Helsinki’s cultural landscape while bringing together the Museum of Finnish Architecture and the Design Museum Helsinki under one roof. Furthering the city’s goals to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 — aligned with the museum’s anticipated opening — sustainability is a key driver of the concepts.Each of the projects, envisioned to sit along the historic South Harbor, adopts varying approaches to defining a new landmark for the nation — with some carving sculptural forms and other subtly extending their urban fabric. Yet they share a commitment to public accessibility for a new community engagement. The designs include a series of interlocked volumes topped by an undulating roof, a geometric form carved with triangular openings, and a sequence of covered and open squares.486 Moby | all images courtesy of ADMcultural and environmental sustainability root the proposalsOrganized by the Foundation for the Finnish Museum of Architecture and Design and Real Estate Company ADM, the competition called for a 10,050-square-meter museum hosting forward-thinking exhibitions and public programs. It will also house over 900,000 artifacts, including works by iconic Finnish designers such as Alvar and Aino Aalto and Maija Isola, and brand such as Nokia and Fiskars. The selected architectural projects — titled 96 Tyrsky, 351 Kumma, 486 Moby, 545 Tau, and 616 City, Sky and Sea — devise flexible and purpose-built spaces that demonstrate distinct visions guided by principles of environmental, cultural, and social sustainability.Among the selected proposals, 96 Tyrsky stands out for its curved green copper roof and interlocking volumes that create a courtyard filled with natural light. Its use of mass timber for load-bearing structures and interiors underscores Finland’s commitment to sustainable building practices, while its undulating form echoes the waterfront landscape. 351 Kumma takes a compact and low-rise approach, preserving views of its locality while incorporating historical architectural motifs through its slanted, stepped walls and triangular openings. The proposal prioritizes accessibility, allowing visitors to enter directly into the exhibition space from the important Market Square.545 Taua new cultural landmark for helsinki and finland486 Moby presents a wedge-shaped design that maximizes sightlines from the waterfront to Tähtitorninvuori Park. Its compact form and resource-efficient materials — many of which are recycled — demonstrate the initiative’s low-carbon ambitions. Meanwhile, 545 Tau embraces sculptural simplicity with a design that seeks to merely extend the urban fabric of the Market Square and prioritizes visitor accessibility. Lastly, 616 City, Sky and Sea employs curved walls and rooflines to create a lightweight, tent-like structure that harmonizes with the surrounding cityscape. Its central hall offers distinct framed views of Helsinki’s sea and skyline.The finalists will each receive €50,000 to refine their designs, guided by feedback from the jury and stakeholders ahead of the winning entry is revealed in September 2025. Emphasis will be placed on the buildings’ low-carbon designs and the integration of circular economy principles. At the end of the competition, the jury will award three prizes and two purchase agreements, with a total of €150,000 distributed.616 City Sky and Sea616 City Sky and Sea351 Kumma351 Kumma",
