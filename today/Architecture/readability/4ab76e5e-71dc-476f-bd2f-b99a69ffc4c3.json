Audiences just can’t get enough of creator Mike White’s endlessly dissected fantasia on money, sex, power, privilege, and high-dollar spa treatments. Last week in Los Angeles, Jim Thompson—the global lifestyle brand built on the pioneering work of the company’s eponymous founder and Thai silk impresario—threw a lavish fête celebrating the groundswell of interest spurred by the hit HBO series, which was set in Thailand this time around. Pieces from Jim Thompson’s fashion and home collections were prominently featured throughout the series, with many interiors decked out in signature Jim Thompson textiles.Walton Goggins, Mike White, Tayme Thapthimthong, and Dom Hetrakul.

Extravagantly embellished with architectural relics and decorative arts from Thailand and across Asia, Dawnridge provided the perfect backdrop for the festivities.

Since its founding more than seven decades ago, the brand has become synonymous with exceptional Thai craftsmanship and a pioneering spirit that bridges tradition and innovation,” Cancelloni said.Walton Goggins, Tayme Thapthimthong, Jim Thompson CEO Frank Cancelloni, Dom Hetrakul, Natasha Rothwell, and Jon Gries. Photo: Harmony GerberJim Thompson, the man, was an American intelligence operative working for the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in Thailand during World War II. Following the war, he returned to private industry, founding a business that helped revitalize the Thai silk industry in the 1950s and ’60s. He vanished in Malaysia’s Cameron Highlands in 1967, never to be seen again—a famously unsolved mystery that continues to garner interest and speculation to this day. His formidable legacy includes the extraordinary Bangkok house he built in the late 1950s, a place that merged his professional training as an architect and his passion for Asian antiquities. That landmark project provided serious inspiration for The White Lotus’s creative team, and it remains a touchstone for designers working across the globe today.
