  "text": "New research on disaster recovery from the Urban Institute has given a sketch of the complicating factors dictating the timeline for recovery of communities affected by the Los Angeles Fires.  The report’s authors claim their study of recovery timelines following recent wildfires in Hawaii, Colorado, and Northern California indicated that the issuance of new building permits will, alongside the debris removals process, most likely push into the end of the decade. This comes after both the state and city dropped certain requirements recently in an effort to expedite the recovery process. The estimated cost of the damage has been reported at $30 billion per the LA Times.
