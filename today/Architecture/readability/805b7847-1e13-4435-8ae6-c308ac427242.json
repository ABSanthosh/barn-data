However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.The COVID-19 pandemic changed homeowners’ priorities for their outdoor spaces; they’ve since envisioned them as flexible extensions of their residences’ interiors. “It was during the pandemic that we noticed the huge upswing in demand for terraces, balconies, and patios, and that has not abated,” notes mono-monikered New York–based designer Clodagh. ﻿“It’s that need we have to know that we can escape from a confined space: the need for air, sky, and vista.”According to the National Association of Realtors, 64% of homeowners seek to create multifunctional outdoor spaces, which aligns with the boom in the outdoor living market—this market segment is projected to hit $26.8 billion by 2027. But in a sea of new furnishings and materials, what patio trends are here to stay? AD PRO tapped industry experts to share the patio designs shaping today’s outdoor spaces.Keep it seamless“Clients that are looking for their outdoor spaces to be designed similarly to their indoors, so there’s a seamless transition between the two,” explains New York–based interior designer Tina Ramchandani. “Clients are excited about feeling like they are in their living rooms—just outside! This involves carrying the same flooring or same color/finish of flooring, similar furniture and fabric styles, and the same color palette over to the exterior area.”Landscape architect Robert Bell is seeing more use of color outdoors, as clients and manufacturers move away from a monotone look inside too. “While adding pops of color via cushions or pillows has long been a design trick, clients are committing to unique tile and furniture colors like blue, coral or yellow,” he says, noting that he recently designed a flamingo pink garden gate for a home in South Florida.Join NowAD PRO members enjoy exclusive benefits.

Taking it a step further, and matching styles is even better. “We design our outdoor spaces the same way we tackle our interiors. We look for comfort, luxury, and timelessness,” explains Jose Achi, senior director of design development at Clodagh Design. “Our exterior experiences not only include the usual outdoor living room arrangements, but we truly believe in people’s primal connection to the outdoors—we even provide beds to be able to sleep under a starry sky to complete the outdoor living experience.”Providing the same level of comfort in both interior and exterior spaces is important too. For example, installing a flush heater over an outdoor dining table or outdoor living room helps smooth the transition from inside to outside the home without the shock of a temperature change, says Southern California–based designer Dustin Morris, principal of AD PRO Directory firm Eyoh Design.“Often placed near the large sliding doors, the warm air creates a barrier that even helps regulate the indoor temperature so that you can have those doors opened up and the cold air doesn’t seem to get in,” Morris explains. “Homeowners love them because you are always able to use that outdoor space.”Meanwhile, a pass-through window to the patio can set up a physical link to ground outdoor design. “Many of our homes set up fold-away servery windows with bar seating looking back into the kitchen,” Morris says. “This allows the kitchen to be connected to the outdoor space and for the people seated outdoors to be connected to the people in the kitchen.” While this window is a very social feature, it also satisfies a functional need, as food from the indoor kitchen can be served through it to the outdoor kitchen or dining space.The veranda at this Tucson, Arizona, home by landscape architect Elizabeth Przygoda overflows with cozy desert personality. Courtesy of Elizabeth PrzygodaGo plush—or super sleek“In the last few years, we’ve been incorporating more furniture that has the feel and the look of indoor furniture,” says AD PRO Directory designer Tom Stringer.To put a finer point on it, says San Francisco–based interior and product designer Jiun Ho, “Out is the dull, square-edged, traditional, utilitarian teak furniture that screams ‘Grandma’s house.’” Instead, pros are embracing sculptural, weather-resilient furnishings that can hold their own—and play as well outside as they potentially could indoors. Noting that most conventional teak outdoor furniture has stayed the same for over 50 years, Ho has taken to designing pieces to function well wherever good design is needed. For example, his Furu outdoor dining furniture melds teak and stainless steel for a sexy aesthetic.Jiun Ho’s creations, like the teak Kiyomizu Dining Table, buck cliché conventions of traditional outdoor furniture. Courtesy of Jiun HoLindsey Jamison, lead designer and partner at Rumor Designs, loves a curved sofa on a patio. “In an open space like a patio, it can function in the center of the space which makes everything feel more playful seeing the curves,” she notes. “[Organic shapes] immediately make a patio feel cozy and warm. A neutral fabric curved sofa will add a sense of serene, calm—everything you want to relax in an outdoor space.”LA-based interior designer Kishani Perera says clients are gravitating toward “softer, less-structured furniture in favor of cozier pieces more in line with indoor pieces than outdoor—whether it’s for a more cushy sofa, a fab weather-resistant rug, or a rounded occasional table.” Genevieve Lake, owner of Florida-based design firm Love Lake Studio, points out that advances in performance fabrics can also lend a helping hand. “Gone are the days of crunchy, cardboard-feeling outdoor furniture,” she says; today, it’s all about velvets, weaves, and bouclés.Lauren Lerner, CEO and founder of Living with Lolo in Scottsdale, Arizona, goes so far as adding accouterments beyond just furniture. “We enjoy crafting outdoor living spaces furnished with rugs and even outdoor TVs,” she says. “Our designs [use] natural materials like stone, wood, and plants to create an organic, inviting ambiance.” And don’t forget to create shade where it may not exist naturally, says Indiana-based designer Susan Yeley: “Big sturdy umbrellas add architectural interest and make outdoor gatherings on sunny days more pleasant.”Landscape architect Elizabeth Przygoda, founder of Boxhill, is noticing the rise of custom ramadas and shade structures. “These aren’t just to block the sun, they’re fully outfitted spaces with lighting, fans, and lounge setups,” she explains. “In the past month alone, we’ve installed five of them. They’re definitely an investment, but they completely transform the usability of a yard. It’s astonishing how quickly they transform a space.”No need for overly coordinated patio sets, says Inner Gardens’ Stephen Block: A mix of vintage and modern is just as compelling for an outdoor space as it is for an indoor one. Courtesy of Inner GardensMix materials, eras, and price pointsStephen Block of the store Inner Gardens, with locations in Malibu and Culver City, California, cautions against going matchy-matchy through old standbys like coordinating deck sets. He prefers to invest in “an eclectic mix”—wood, wicker, metal, and concrete—to carve out a more creative, personalized vibe. And designers shouldn’t feel too hemmed-in by sticking to a particular era of furnishings, he adds: “Mixing vintage with modern pieces creates a timeless aesthetic that feels fresh while adding character and depth to the space.”Przygoda says she appreciates the trend of mixing old and new—like sourcing vintage captain’s chairs for the ends of a contemporary dining table—and is seeing a lot more mixing of highs and lows. “Someone might put an IKEA rug under a $12,000 outdoor table—and it works,” she says. “That’s one of the things I love most about landscape and outdoor design: It’s much more forgiving than interior design.”She adds, “Layering these highs and lows and olds and news gives spaces ‘legs’ to stand on, and they don't feel so staged and catalogue-ish.”LA-based interior designer Alex Yeske has noticed an influx of European inspirations in patio trends. “I am personally a huge fan of European outdoor spaces and like to achieve that vibe from a mix of materials—rattan, iron, stone, wood—and mixing and matching new pieces with vintage finds,” she says. “There have been many fun iron and powder-coated steel furniture lines introduced for outdoor use, as well as more options beyond stripes for patterned outdoor fabrics.”To achieve a curated look, Shaw mixes brands and textures. “While there is something appealing about the clean and minimal approach of finding a furniture line you love and purchasing a full set, there is a richness and greater sense of personality and originality that comes from mixing things up,” she says. “It ultimately allows our clients to have a greater feeling of satisfaction and connection to their outdoor living spaces.”Source eco-friendly findsAesthetics and functionality are not the only concerns for patio designs; increasingly, homeowners and designers weigh environmental impact when furnishing an open-air room. “Clients are asking for products made of more natural materials instead of plastic. Outdoor furniture made from rope, teak, and naturally sourced wood is not only better for the environment, but also much better to the touch than plastic,” Stringer notes.Similarly, Joseph Carline, partner at Kligerman Architecture \u0026 Design in New York, says his firm’s recent focus for patio design has been to “use local materials that not only exude timeless beauty but are sustainable and ethically sourced.” Local reclaimed or FSC-certified hardwoods and natural stone are top choices for patio furniture, as they tend to have a smaller carbon footprint. “We also often use US-made brick products as patio pavers, which are endlessly versatile, durable, and just look stunning,” he continues, naming materials like limestone and sandstone as options that “offer a range of textures and colors to suit various aesthetic preferences while maintaining sustainability.”Bell also sees increased focus on recycled or reused paving materials. “Reclaimed Chicago brick pavers are a perennial favorite but now mixed with tabby materials like recycled shell or glass pavers,” he says. “Bricks and concrete pavers are often made locally or regionally and may be a greener (and tariff-free) choice compared to European or Indian stones shipped long distances. We've had lots of simulated limestone paving made in the Palm Beach area.”To further reduce a garden’s environmental impact, Carline says his firm “embraces water-saving landscaping techniques, such as native plantings and permeable hardscaping surfaces to help conserve water and promote biodiversity. These elements not only enhance the beauty of the patio but also contribute to a healthier ecosystem.”Carline also says his firm “embraces water-saving landscaping techniques, such as native plantings and permeable hardscaping surfaces to help conserve water and promote biodiversity. These elements not only enhance the beauty of the patio but also contribute to a healthier ecosystem.”A small private patio in the citrus grove at Paseo La Cresta II, designed by KAA © Roger Davies/OTTOAdopt native and edible plantsWhat’s an outdoor living space without proper plantings? Trees, shrubs, plants, and flowers not only add aesthetic appeal but also ground a patio design in its site-specific locale. “Biophilia in design is magic to all of us,” Clodagh offers. “We like to turn terraces and patios, large and small, into greenery-filled gardens as much as we can, all for a huge mental health boost. They make wonderful spaces to sneak out and connect with nature and disconnect from devices. All the senses become more alert outdoors and you can listen to the sounds of life in your garden.”Nashville-based designer Brad Ramsey notices a trend toward using native species in patio planting, as they tend to require less maintenance. “Many people also opt for native evergreen plants and perennials for year-round green and annual color without having to purchase and replant every spring,” he says.“Using trees and shrubs that are native to your region contributes to a healthy ecosystem and attracts highly desirable visitors to the garden such as birds and butterflies,” explain Damien and Jacqueline Harrison, principals at landscape firm Harrison Green in New York. “We like to ensure that at least two thirds of our gardens are made up of native plants.”The design duo also favors edible plants, which are both beautiful and functional, and likes to use espaliers to train fruiting trees to grow in a flat plane along a wall. They say they’ve had great success with using espaliers for apple and pear trees in small patio spaces in New York City, as they take up less space. “They’re a nice alternative to a vine for coverage on a wall and will immediately elevate the look of any garden,” they add.LA-based senior landscape architect Michael McGowan of AD PRO Directory firm KAA Design loves the idea of smaller, more intimate patio spaces that integrate biodiverse gardens—think plants, flowers, and veggies. He even created a mini fruit tree grove into one client project. “The divine scent of spring citrus blossoms and comfy furniture entice residents to spend time enjoying the serenity of the space,” notes McGowan.A robust dining setup, sculptural outdoor lighting, bar cart, and a fireside lounge help make Donna Mondi’s design for this alfresco space especially inviting. Photo: David PattersonFire it upAn outdoor fire feature can be the pièce de résistance of a patio design. “We rarely design homes without an outdoor living room, complete with a fireplace,” says Bruce Bockus, architect and chairman at Bockus Payne. From actual wood-burning fireplaces to gas-powered devices that can turn on via smartphone or remote control, these amenities can help extend the season of a patio into the cooler months. “We like to hook up firepits directly to a gas line for easy-peasy ambiance and heat,” says Yeley in Indiana.“Horizontal gas fireplaces are a trending design feature right now. You can place them low and position a television above it at an easily viewable height,” adds Bockus, noting the need to offer clients a few options. “A firepit is the least expensive way,” he says, but it needs to be placed in the open. “If you like the feeling of being under the stars, it might be the perfect choice for you.”But beyond including just any old fire source, Stafford of Rumor Designs says that firepits are trending away from sleek, modern forms and leaning into structures that exude more character. “Lately, we’ve found how important it is to make the most simple things interesting,” she says. “For so long we’ve whittled elements down to such a modern, clean skeleton with no [personality], and we’re ready to add thoughtful details back into design elements.”Przygoda adds, “With all the recent wildfires on the West Coast, we’re seeing more focus on safety. Clients are opting for firepits that use hidden propane tanks, which can be easily shut off, contained, and controlled. They’re beautiful but practical, which is exactly what outdoor living should be.”A multi-level garden in San Francisco for architectural designer Abigail Turin features a small pool and seamless indoor-outdoor access.

Photo: Sang An / Styling: Rod HipskindTake the plungeAlthough there was a time when grand backyard swimming pools were all the rage, today’s homeowners are thinking smaller—much smaller—and leaning into more niche spa amenities like cold plunges. Often this is because clients “want to build their own private sanctuary to decompress after a stressful work day or lounge on the weekend,” notes Jennifer Nawada Evans, owner and designer at Nawada Landscape Design.“We love the growing emphasis on wellness in design and that more people are putting in saunas and pools,” says North Carolina–based interior designer Carrie Moore. “The design of these elements is getting more sophisticated. Tiny plunge pools are being put in smaller urban backyards, and while they are [compact], they still have a very calming impact on our senses.”Taking the plunge, so to speak, also leaves more space to enjoy the rest of the garden. Plus they’re easier to install, says Nawada Evans. “They take up less space, water, and energy than a standard-size swimming pool, and they require fewer chemicals.”Blu Dot Longday Bar CartTerrace Solid Wood Bar CartBring on the bar carts“Designers love a good bar cart moment, and outdoor patios are no exception,” says Denver-based designer Donna Mondi, who recently added Holly Hunt’s Omura bar cart to her own patio. “It’s been used for tequila tasting, a backup bar, and champagne service for events at our home,” she notes. “It’s stylish, strong enough to withstand the elements, and mobile so we can wheel it where we need it.Dan Mazzarini, principal and creative director at BHDM Design, also thinks that bar carts add a lavish aesthetic to patio designs for all seasons. “Bar carts can do much more than just hold liquor,” he explains. “From accommodating dim sum to buffets, these pieces are both form and function and go from poolside chic to dinner party elegant as the sun sets.” There are plenty of bar-cart styles that combine the warmth of wood with cool aluminum to meld well with other patio furniture and decor.North Carolina–based Carrie Moore decked out this alfresco kitchen with plenty of pendant lighting and cozy cushions.
