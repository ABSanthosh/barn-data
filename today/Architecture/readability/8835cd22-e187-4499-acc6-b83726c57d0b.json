A founding principal of Overland Partners and Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, Archer brings almost 40 years of experience in sustainable design and community-focused practice. The appointment follows an active year for O’More College, which graduated its first architecture cohort this spring and celebrated the 25th anniversary of its annual fashion show. Originally established in 1970, the college joined Belmont in 2018 and is home to Tennessee’s first undergraduate architecture program. \"I am deeply honored to join O'More College and build upon its extraordinary legacy,\" Archer said about the appoinment. \"My work has always focused on leveraging design as a vehicle to help all humans flourish across all creative disciplines. The collaborative spirit I've witnessed at O'More, with community-engaged projects across fashion, interior design and architecture, exemplifies the holistic design education that prepares students to make meaningful impact through their creative work.\"",
