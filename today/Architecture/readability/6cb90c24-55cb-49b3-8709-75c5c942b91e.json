  "text": "Architecture firm Estudio AMA has released designs for a 90-metre-high residential tower in Paraguay wrapped in balconies supported on a concrete grid. The Bulnesia tower will be located in Distrito Perseverancia in Paraguay's capital, Asunción, and will contain apartments as well as street-level restaurants and shops. Estudio AMA has released designs of a residential tower in ParaguayDeveloped by local company Grupo La Perseverancia and designed by Estudio AMA, the tower's design focuses on social connection, according to the team. Renders show a tower wrapped in a gridded, concrete facade. Symmetrical, square balconies surround the core of the building, while its ground-level and upper floors are slightly extended. It features a gridded facadeThe design was informed by the \"charm of tranquil streets and community life\" according to the Estudio AMA, as well as providing balconies for each unit. \"One of the main design intentions was to maximize views across all facades by creating frames with the concrete grid facade, offering perspectives of the city and the river,\" Estudio AMA told Dezeen. \"A key design feature was ensuring that every residential unit, even the one-bedroom ones, included a terrace or balcony that could serve as an extension of the social area.\" The tower will contain one to three-bedroom apartments and amenities spaces including an outdoor pool, relaxation areas and co-working spaces. Interior renders show furnishings in a palette of neutral colours, with warm-toned wood and stone used throughout. Its interiors pull in Brazilian and mid-century modern influencesAccording to the studio, the interior design also pulls in Brazilian influences and mid-century modern details in contrast to the \"minimalist\" architecture of its exterior. \"With its emphasis on sustainability, elegance, and social connection, Bulnesia establishes itself as a new social hub and an icon of urban living in Asunción,\" said the team. The building will include amenities such as a pool deck on the top floorIt joins other news of a host of projects under development in South America, including \"the world's tallest residential tower\" in Brazil. Renders were recently unveiled of another Estuio AMA project in Guadalaraja made of red-toned concrete, while Equipo de Arquitectura completed a house topped with a vaulted brick roof elsewhere in Asunción.
