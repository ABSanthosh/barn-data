  "text": "Casa Carceller stands in Foios’ old neighborhoodQuadrat Estudio’s Casa Carceller aims to revive the heritage of traditional residential architecture in Foios, Spain. The residence stands surrounded by adjacent building walls in a succession of narrow, low-lying plots within an old working-class neighborhood. The height, shape, and choice of materials of the structure, such as brick,  are intended to harmonize with neighboring houses while maintaining a non-obtrusive presence. The design concept prioritizes privacy, light, and spatial efficiency, maximizing the living area across the entire length of the plot. The interior layout guides occupants through various rooms while keeping the ceiling line intact. A centrally located staircase, illuminated from a skylight above, structures the main area and connects different levels of the house. An inner courtyard separates the building from its neighbor, allowing natural light to flood the interior spaces.all images by Mariela ApollonioQuadrat Estudio Showcases Handcrafted BrickworkThe designers at Quadrat Estudio carefully select materials for Casa Carceller to highlight the imperfections inherent in handmade elements, while strategically incorporating brick, making use of the local brick industry. The use of bricks in various formats meets the structural requirements of the residence while serving as facade cladding and forming the gutter in an extended format. Solid bricks finish the interior walls and appear prominently on the facade. Arranged vertically with an increasing gap pattern, these bricks reveal their non-supporting character. The visible sand and white cement used to grout the clay bricks on the walls and floors contribute to the handcrafted aesthetic of the facade.
