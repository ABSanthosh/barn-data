  "text": "What are current trends for home bars?One of the biggest trends in home bars is catering to those who don’t drink. “Clients are expanding their bar setups beyond traditional beer, wine, and spirits,” says Goesling. “Sparkling water, coffee, non-alcoholic beverages, and crafted mocktails are redefining how these spaces function throughout the day. As a result, versatile storage, specialized chilling solutions, and multi-use accessories are becoming essential.”Speaking of versatility, stealth setups are another trend, especially as home bars climb out of the basement. Goldbach says, “Increasingly, home bars are designed to be concealed when not in use. Pocket doors, operable walls, and closed storage solutions are becoming more prevalent, allowing these spaces to blend seamlessly into the home.”Are wet bars in style?The wet bar, a staple in the well-to-do homes of the 1970s, seemed to disappear for a few decades. But it’s back. “If you have the room, a wet bar is the way to go,” says Renee DiSanto of Park \u0026 Oak in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. “It adds convenience with a sink and running water, making prep and cleanup seamless.” Its countertop-centric cousin, the dry bar (basically a wet bar minus the sink), doesn’t have all the bells and whistles but is still useful—especially if you’re simply pouring wine and beer rather than mixing cocktails.Are bar carts on trend?“Bar carts remain a popular choice, though their appeal has shifted,” says D’Agostino. “They are now celebrated for their charm and practicality in smaller spaces or settings where a larger bar installation isn’t feasible.” Though if you have a small bar space and don’t need the mobility of a rolling cart, a bar cabinet or repurposed console table are similar decor ideas.How much does it cost to build a home bar?The variety in home bar design means the cost can vary widely as well. “On the more accessible end, a simple setup—incorporating a bar cart and custom shelving—can range from $2,000 to $3,000,” says D’Agostino. On the other end of the spectrum, a luxe space with marble countertops, plumbing installation, and a full-fledged lounge area can run over six figures. “A high-end home bar with premium materials, custom cabinetry, appliances like ice makers and wine refrigerators, and finishes such as brass fixtures or bespoke upholstery can easily cost $100,000 or more,” he says. “It’s about finding the blend that suits both your lifestyle and your budget.”",
