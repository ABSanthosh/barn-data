A showstopping renovation by Modify Homes that turns past limitations into future-proof design. This before-and-after transformation captures the easygoing energy of beachside living through a mix of sculptural curves, smart sustainability, and effortless indoor-outdoor flow. Facade: Respecting the Past, Hinting at the Future From tired brick and ornate gates to crisp lines and a white exterior, this renovation transforms a dated facade into a minimalist modern entry. The original red tiled roof remains, anchoring the home’s past, but everything beneath it has been reimagined. In the photo below, we see how a clean-lined carport, vertical white screening, and soft landscaping signal the calm, contemporary design language carried throughout the rest of the home. The original courtyard featured dated French doors, exposed utilities, and uneven paving. After the renovation, a sleek white exterior and fresh landscaping give the entry a serene, design-forward look. A pistachio green door completes the clean, coastal feel. Rear Facade: A Contemporary Coastal Statement The transformation truly unfolds at the rear. The once-boxy exterior was replaced with a two-level sculptural form wrapped in white exterior wall finish and curved vertical cladding. Timber-framed sliding glass doors invite seamless transition between inside and out, opening directly onto a new lawn, deck, and in-ground pool. A curving white upper level with vertical battens rises above the traditional terracotta roof, blending bold modernism with suburban heritage. Backyard Entertaining, Refined A sleek outdoor BBQ kitchen sits against a wood fence, featuring clean white battens with hidden storage, seamlessly extending from an open-plan living area onto a light wood deck. Before the Remodel: Dark, Dated, and Disconnected The existing ground-floor layout felt cramped and tired. In the kitchen, which is at the rear of the home, clutter collected on the island, and corner shelving became a catch-all, highlighting the lack of purposeful storage. An arched brick opening broke the visual flow between the kitchen, living, and dining areas, acting as a visual and spatial barrier that segmented the open-plan layout into disconnected zones. While the arch added character, its bulky form and contrasting material drew attention to the transition rather than creating cohesion. Below, the flooring further disrupted continuity: cold, heavy slate-look tiles in the kitchen abruptly gave way to pale wood in the living area, amplifying the sense of division. Instead of a unified, free-flowing space, the home felt like a series of separate rooms loosely stitched together. Living Room: Open, Bright, and Breezy The living space is now open-plan and visually expansive, with floor-to-ceiling glass doors, a low grey sofa, and a woven jute rug. Wood accents and white walls create a calm, minimalist atmosphere. Kitchen: Function Wrapped in Sophistication Th kitchen embraces a soft minimalism with clean lines, matte white cabinetry, and integrated appliances. A long island with warm wood accents anchors the space, paired with woven stools that echo the natural textures outside. Discrete storage is seamlessly tucked beneath the wood staircase, maintaining the home’s clean lines while adding practical functionality. Dining Area: A Serene Take on Coastal Dining The dining zone flows directly from the kitchen and captures the essence of coastal minimalism with its soft palette, natural materials and considered styling. A rounded table anchors the room, surrounded by sculptural wood chairs that echo the curve of the table’s edge. Overhead, a pair of pale mist-colored pendant lights lend a subtle pop of color while tying into the home’s beachside context, which is reinforced by a framed ocean image on the wall. Study Nook, Kid’s Playroom, and Laundry Room: Clever Space Carving A serene hallway off the front door showcases a refined approach to minimalism, where full-height flush doors blend seamlessly into the wall to create a clean, sculptural surface. A compact study nook, kids’ playroom, and well-planned laundry sit discreetly off the hallway. The laundry room with a powder room tucked behind a pocket door, stays invisible until needed, then fully functional when in use. The powder room pairs a terrazzo-tiled wall with a sleek floating vanity and rounded mirror. Soft lighting and a muted palette create a calm, refined feel in a compact space. The study nook features custom joinery in warm wood, with integrated shelves and a built-in desk that maximizes space. A wood chair complements the natural palette, while filtered light from the sheer Roman blind enhances the cozy, focused atmosphere. The playroom features corner sliding doors that open fully to a small outdoor deck, seamlessly extending the play space. Sheer curtains filter natural light across the minimalist interior, while built-in cabinetry provides sleek, hidden storage. A round rug softens the polished concrete floor. Staircase: Concealed, Calm, and Carefully Detailed The original staircase was narrow with steep steps, dark grey carpet, and white wood paneling. A small skylight provided limited light, highlighting the cramped layout. The new staircase is tucked behind a blade wall near the kitchen, continuing the home’s palette of wood, concrete, and white finishes. Its concealed placement maintains clean architectural lines and adds a quiet sense of discovery as you move through the space. Skylight: Soft Light From Above A striking oculus skylight was introduced above the stair void, acting as both a sculptural focal point and a powerful source of natural light. This circular opening floods the center of the home with daylight, subtly marking the transition between ground and first floors. Its placement enhances the home’s passive solar performance while drawing the eye upward, creating a moment of quiet drama within the otherwise restrained interior palette. At different times of day, the light shifts to cast soft, organic shadows across the curved surfaces below, reinforcing the project’s calm and cohesive atmosphere. First Floor: Light, Air, and Family Function All bedrooms are now located upstairs, delivering the privacy the owners needed. In this bedroom, there’s a corner featuring a softly curved window, while a custom-built window seat with integrated storage below adds functionality and a cozy spot to rest. The pale wood floor and tonal cabinetry maintain a calm, cohesive palette. A built-in wardrobe with flush cabinetry lines one wall in the main bedroom, maintaining a clean and uncluttered look. Also part of the main bedroom suite, this walk-in wardrobe features full-height cabinetry with wood disc handles and soft battens that filter light through the window. Ensuite Bathroom: Curves and Calm in a Private Retreat The original bathroom shows a compact, dated space with dark tile flooring, a basic vanity, and a combined shower-over-bath setup. Frosted glass windows provide privacy but limit natural light, while cluttered surfaces and aging fixtures contribute to the room’s cramped, utilitarian feel. The new main bedroom ensuite, now concealed behind a closet door, continues the home’s sculptural language with a soft, curving shower wall that adds an unexpected moment of architectural elegance. A muted palette of off-white tiles and speckled terrazzo underfoot reinforces the spa-like feel, while wall-mounted fixtures and a large mirror keep the space feeling open and serene. Natural light enters gently from the adjacent window, heightening the room’s sense of calm. Family Bathroom: Streamlined Design With Everyday Ease Clad in soft white tiles and warm terrazzo, the family bathroom delivers effortless functionality with a refined finish. A built-in bathtub sits flush within a terrazzo surround, creating a sculptural edge that doubles as a wet zone. In the shower, a rainfall shower head and hand-held fixture offer flexibility for every stage of family life. Vertical blinds filter natural light, casting playful shadows across the surface while maintaining privacy. Every element feels deliberately pared-back and polished. This renovation proves that calm doesn’t mean characterless. Through thoughtful spatial planning, custom detailing and a finely tuned material palette, the home now feels both deeply resolved and effortlessly serene.
