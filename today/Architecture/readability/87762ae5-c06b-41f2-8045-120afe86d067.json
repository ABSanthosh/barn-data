  "text": "Architecture studio Diller Scofidio + Renfro has unveiled a one-hundred-metre-tall structure comprised of cascading pool terraces for the Therme Dubai wellness resort. Set to be built in Dubai's Zabeel Park, the resort will feature a series of staggered, rounded platforms populated with pools, lush planting and waterfalls. Designed for developer Therme Group, visualisations show a lake surrounding Therme Dubai and a swooping transparent facade partly wrapping its structure to form indoor and outdoor spaces. Therme Dubai will contain terraces partly covered with a transparent facadeDiller Scofidio + Renfro designed the resort to rise to one hundred metres tall, intending to create a landmark that provides a relaxing retreat from the city. Spaces and amenities will be divided across three sections – Play, Relax and Restore – and will include indoor and outdoor thermal pools, saunas, steam rooms, mineral baths, water slides, restaurants, an indoor botanical garden and events space. The design has been approved by Dubai ruler Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and aligns with the city's Quality of Life Strategy 2033, according to the developer. Its staggered structure will rise to one hundred metres tall\"Elevated high above the concerns of everyday urban life, Therme Dubai is an oasis in the sky,\" said Diller Scofidio + Renfro founding partner Elizabeth Diller. \"It emerges from the lake of a revitalised Zabeel Park as a series of botanical islands stacked into a tower,\" she continued. \"Each island is a platform for thermal pools, decks, and verdant indoor and outdoor vegetation; each offers a distinctive atmosphere, and each is oriented toward the dramatic view of the Dubai skyline.\" Therme Group hopes that Therme Dubai will help improve wellbeing in the city by combining nature with leisure facilities. According to the developer, 90 per cent of the resort's thermal pool water will be recycled. Therme Dubai will contain multiple pools\"Dubai is a city that understands the future must be built with wellbeing at its core,\" said Therme Group founder Robert Hanea. \"We are creating more than a destination – we are shaping how cities can integrate nature, water and culture to elevate quality of life at scale.\" Construction on Therme Dubai is due to commence in 2026 and is expected to be completed in 2028. Other projects in Dubai that have recently been revealed include a pair of skyscrapers by Foster + Partners that will be linked by a penthouse swimming pool and the Dubai Walk masterplan, which will feature an elevated air-conditioned looped path.
