The city’s charm now extends beyond its grand hotels, and the best Airbnbs in Florence—from 16th century palazzi and artist ateliers on the Arno to regal apartments where the Duomo is practically within reach—offer some of the best rooms with views in this historic, beautiful place. Here’s where to stay when Florence comes calling.Perks: On the banks of the Arno, well-equipped kitchen, washing machineIf you ever had dreams of being an artist in Italy, this one-bedroom apartment will push you a little further to make your dreams a reality. Owned by a renowned Florentine sculptor, the bright and airy space is brimming with art, sculptures, antiques, and books. Located on the banks of the Arno, the apartment is very close to the city center—about a 10-minute walk—but in a serene neighborhood off the tourist track. It’s a charmingly old-world spot with a tub instead of a shower, and easy to fall in love with. Although best for just a couple, there is an additional bed in the living room, making it an option for a group of friends or a family of three. From $629 for two nights, with a two-night minimum stay.Perks: Spacious, terrace, sunroom, well-equipped kitchenThis spacious one-bedroom apartment is located on the second floor of the Palazzo Rosselli del Turco, which dates back to the 16th century. While simply furnished, the building is a work of art in itself, with a loggia and beautifully preserved architectural details, including magnificent fireplaces, original flooring, and ornate ceiling frescos. But the views out the windows aren’t bad either: The large terrace overlooks the stunning Basilica of Santa Spirito. This is an ideal spot for travelers looking to stay in a quieter area; here you’re located between the neighborhoods of Santo Spirito and San Frediano, and just across the Arno from the city center. From $741 for two nights, with a two-night minimum.Perks: Private garden, two bathrooms, baby crib, high chair, baby bathtubThis first-floor apartment is located in a neo-Renaissance mansion built in the 19th century by an English artist and a Florentine architect. Descendants of the architect live on the top floor of the building today and have arranged the mansion-style apartment Airbnb to show off the grandeur of the space. They’re so dedicated to its history, in fact, that most of the furniture is original, and they’ve preserved the original frescoes and fireplaces. But the space has also been completely modernized, with 21st-century comforts like a modern shower, dishwasher, and washing machine. A communal art library and studio is set up in the building’s loggia, which guests are welcome to use, and the Airbnb features a private interior garden as well. It’s also well-equipped for those traveling with young children, as the apartment comes with a crib, high chair, baby bathtub, toys, and children’s dishes. From $1,641 for three nights, with a three-night minimum.Perks: In the historic city center, recently renovated, crib and high chairIt doesn’t get more historic, or more Florentine, than sleeping in the home next to Dante’s house, and you can practically feel the poet’s presence here. This stunning three-bedroom apartment was recently fully renovated, but mercifully, the original wall frescoes and vaulted ceilings were preserved. This is the place to bring a crowd, or at least a full family, thanks to its two king bedrooms, one queen, plus crib. Although the spacious, tasteful interiors alone are reason enough to book, being in the heart of Florence’s center is the cherry on top. From $933 for three nights, with a three-night minimum.Perks: Private terrace, backyard, very modern kitchen and bathroomNewer by Florence’s standards—Palazzina Maresa dates from the 1920s—this Airbnb feels decidedly contemporary thanks to a renovation that converted the building from one palace into eight separate apartments. This special one-bedroom unit features custom-designed furniture that gives a very fresh 21st-century twist to the Renaissance-heavy city. The apartment’s original wall plaster is preserved, and their light salmon hue harmonizes beautifully with the ultramodern, somewhat stark white and steel furnishings. A private terrace is a cozy antidote. From $539 for two nights, with a two-night minimum.Perks: Lots of space, pet-friendly, terrace, washer and dryer, optional housekeeping servicesA true palace, this Airbnb sleeps 11 guests and has a staggering five bathrooms to accommodate everyone. And as it’s just steps from the city’s most sought-after places, like the Ponte Vecchio and the Uffizi Gallery, the location could not be more central or convenient. A modern conversion of a 17th-century building, the five-bedroom home features double-height ceilings, exposed beams, contemporary, luxurious furniture, and a private terrace. And this being a palace, for an additional cost, the host can arrange services including daily housekeeping, laundry services, linen changes, and the like. From $15,409 for seven nights, with a seven-night minimum.Perks: Dedicated workspace, crib, prime locationNot far from the Piazza della Repubblica, this stylish apartment is minimalist to the fullest extent of the word. So, while it might not provide the coziest stay, it promises to deliver a beautiful one. There is room for two adults, and a crib is available, but we imagine this as the perfect place for a single traveler looking to immerse themselves in a self-declared artistic residency, using the apartment’s dedicated workspace to dig into a project, and the Spartan, stylish space as a resting spot at the end of a creatively fulfilling day. Guests should note that the apartment is on the upper floor of a multi-floor, non-elevator building. From $1,263 for two nights, with a two-night minimum.Perks: Prime location in the center of Florence, amazing views, underfloor heatingThe view out the window of this one-bedroom could not be more iconic. Here, Florence’s Duomo— the Santa Maria del Fiore—looks so close you could almost touch it. Besides its prime location in the historic city center, this Airbnb serves as a palate cleanser after a long day of exploring. The interiors are so luxurious, it feels more like a hotel than a privately owned space, with welcome amenities including a plush king-size bed, an oversized soaking tub, a compact suite-like living room complete with a large TV, and an ultramodern kitchenette. From $747 per night.Perks: Elevator-accessible, fully equipped kitchen, self-check-in, great views, lots of roomThis three-bedroom home has a striking amount of room for being in the center of Florence: room for five guests to stay comfortably, to cook giant pasta meals in the well-equipped kitchen, and to enjoy the fruits of their labor at a long, rustic dining table. The views are striking too—here the Duomo appears just down the street. The third-floor, elevator-accessible (still not a given in Europe) apartment blends contemporary design into a traditional space complete with exposed wood beams, lofted, vaulted ceilings, and tile floors. From $792 for two nights with a two-night minimum.",
