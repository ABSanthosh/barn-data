Architizer’s jury, comprising over 250 experts across architecture, technology and design, brings a wealth of global knowledge and diverse perspectives to the selection process. Each year, we’re thrilled to introduce new leaders who are shaping the future of the built environment with cutting-edge innovations and revolutionary ideas. Enter the 13th Annual A+Awards This year, we are proud to welcome five trailblazing experts who are redefining architecture through technology. From the integration of AI and generative design to the creation of mixed-reality environments and the critical exploration of the internet’s materiality, these innovators are paving the way for a more dynamic and inclusive profession. Their collective expertise spans computational design, game design, digital literacy and AI education, offering invaluable insights into how architecture can harness emerging tools to tackle the most pressing challenges of our time. Discover how these five exceptional thought leaders are reshaping the architecture’s technological landscape and bringing their expertise to this year’s Architizer A+Awards jury. Ismail Seleit AI Influencer, Foster + Partners Ismail Seleit is a design architect at the industry-leading Foster and Partners, specializing in design technology. With extensive experience in architecture and computational design, Ismail has contributed to diverse projects, ranging from design competitions to the realization of buildings on various scales. Actively supporting design teams, Ismail leverages his expertise in BIM and Computational Design to navigate complex challenges. His primary focus is on enabling project teams to achieve efficient, informed, and collaborative design outcomes. Collaborating across departments, Ismail works to implement innovative methodologies to manage the design process from urban planning to product scale. Simultaneously, Ismail engages in applied research, exploring new opportunities for implementing cutting-edge design workflows. His research specifically focuses into the integration of generative AI image-generating tools, with a keen interest in the combination of Stable Diffusion and ControlNet. This unique approach offers various techniques for generating controlled image compositions based on diverse user-defined inputs. Beyond his architectural pursuits, Ismail is an ambient-electronic music producer, with a focus on film scores. He has composed and produced soundtracks for architectural short films and contributed to the music and sound design of various independent films. Ismail’s passion for creative thinking, coupled with his dedication to design problem-solving, continues to drive his multifaceted and innovative endeavors. Keir Regan-Alexander Principal, Arka Works Keir is an AEC Domain Expert operating with one foot in practice and one in live software development. He founded Arka Works with a mission to prepare the profession for AI-driven change. He does this by helping architects, clients and startups to effectively apply the latest Generative Design and AI tools to the work they already do, so that they can adapt to a rapidly shifting professional landscape. Mindy Seu Designer and Technologist, UCLA Department of Design Media Arts Mindy Seu is a designer and technologist based in New York City and Los Angeles. Her expanded practice involves archival projects, techno-critical writing, performative lectures and design commissions. Her latest writing surveys feminist economies, historical precursors of the metaverse and the materiality of the internet. Mindy’s ongoing Cyberfeminism Index, which gathers three decades of online activism and net art, was commissioned by Rhizome, presented at the New Museum, and awarded the Graham Foundation Grant. She has lectured internationally at cultural institutions (Barbican Centre, New Museum), academic institutions (Columbia University, Central Saint Martins) and mainstream platforms (Pornhub, SSENSE, Google), and been a resident at MacDowell, Sitterwerk Foundation, Pioneer Works and Internet Archive. Her design commissions and consultation include projects for the Serpentine Gallery, Canadian Centre for Architecture and MIT Media Lab. Her work has been featured in Vanity Fair, Frieze, Dazed, Brooklyn Rail, i-D and more. Mindy holds an M.Des. from Harvard’s Graduate School of Design and a B.A. in Design Media Arts from the University of California, Los Angeles. As an educator, Mindy was formerly an Assistant Professor at Rutgers Mason Gross School of the Arts and Critic at Yale School of Art. She is currently an Associate Professor at University of California, Los Angeles in the Department of Design Media Arts. Stjepan Mikulic Founder, AI in AEC j.d.o.o Stjepan is the founder of AI in AEC, a company which educates architects, engineers and construction professionals in the practical use of AI. Albeit young, this company has clients in 54 countries across the entire globe! Before embarking on his solo-preneur journey, Stjepan has worked as a Constructing Architect at Europe’s largest engineering practice, Sweco, and as a BIM Lead in the world renowned architectural studio BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group). Stjepan’s main piece of work is the world’s largest database of AI tools for the AEC industry called the AEC AI Hub, accessible to everyone for free and recognized by more than 18k LinkedIn professionals. Leah Wulfman Mixed Reality Architect, Educator, Game Designer, University of Utah, College of Architecture \u0026 Planning, Multi-Disciplinary Design (MDD) Leah Wulfman is a Carrier Bag architect, educator, game designer, digital puppeteer and occasional writer. Trained as an architect, Wulfman has been assembling hybrid virtual and physical spaces to prototype new relationships to technology and nature and challenge normative ideologies so often reinforced by technology and architecture. In addition to mixed reality installations that play with and emphasize the physical, material basis of everything digital, they are presently working on a research series focusing on gamified environments, interactions and materials. Such mixed reality ecologies and interactions find their foundations in disability, trans and queer embodied practice and politics, and operate as lenses to reconfigure and re-contextualize space and time orientations in architectural discourse beyond the normative. Wulfman holds a Bachelors of Architecture degree from Carnegie Mellon University, as well as a Masters of Arts in Fiction and Entertainment at SCI-Arc. They have taught at numerous institutions in the United States, including ArtCenter’s Media Design Practices Graduate Program, IDEAS Program at UCLA Architecture and Urban Design, SCI-Arc, The School of Architecture at Taliesin, and most recently University of Michigan’s Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, where they have developed youth programming and mixed reality coursework. Leah is now at the University of Utah’s College of Architecture and Planning, where they are currently Visiting Assistant Professor in the Division of Multi-Disciplinary Design (MDD). The Final Entry Deadline for Architizer's 2025 A+Product Awards is Friday, January 24. Get your brand in front of the AEC industry’s most renowned designers by submitting today.",
