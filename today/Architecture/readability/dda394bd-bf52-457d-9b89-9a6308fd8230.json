However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Sure, you could post up in a fancy hotel for your next (or first) visit to the Big Easy, but consider the best New Orleans Airbnbs if you want to cosplay as a local. This historic Southern city—bursting with culture, music, and architecture—is best enjoyed right in the center of the action, from the porch of your short-term rental by the French Quarter, perhaps, or in the brick-walled outpost you’ve secured in the Marigny district to hear the neighborhood brass bands as they parade the streets.There are hundred of stylish Airbnb rentals to serve as your cozy home base after a long day of eating and shopping. Take home a souvenir or two near Bourbon Street, inhale some gumbo and fried food in the Garden District, or suit up for an evening out on the town at one of NOLA’s famous nightlife hotspots. Ahead, discover some of our favorite New Orleans Airbnbs for indulging in all the Southern comforts on your stay, from modern Victorian mansions to Creole cottages and light-filled lofts.Courtesy of AirbnbLuxury Pool House in TremeOld World meets New in this private pool house that was renovated just a few years back. Situated behind a classic New Orleans–style home that dates back to 1833, the two-story guesthouse is equipped with a modern kitchenette complete with sleek stainless steel finishes, along with a generous living room for game nights. And for those weary of sharing the property, rest assured that guests are free to roam the backyard and commandeer the pool at their convenience. Plus, the private entrance sure doesn’t hurt. Only a hop, skip, and a jump away from the bars on Bourbon Street, live music on Frenchmen Street, and galleries on Royal Street, this accommodation is most definitely the best of both worlds. From $190 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbThis three-bedroom home is steeped in romance, from the rich color palettes to the dreamy decor (think tasseled curtains, jewel-toned rugs, and floral wallpaper). Admire the original architectural details, like its nearly 200-year-old tongue-and-groove ceiling, up close along your stay and enjoy some of the secret perks that this three-bedroom, two-bathroom home has in store…a private pool and hot tub in the backyard, perfect for winding down after a long day of walking in the summer heat. Oh, and the location itself is not to be overlooked: You’re located just downriver from the iconic French Quarter’s cluster of bars, restaurants, and live music. From $948 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbWith its bright blue exterior and orange front door, you definitely can’t miss this one on a street map. Located in Bywater, a quiet neighborhood filled with creative and corporate professionals alike, this Orleans dwelling has a modern Victorian aesthetic perfect for families and couples looking for a getaway. Owned by Norman, a superhost—how Airbnb designates its most experienced, highly rated hosts—this two-bedroom home is close to plenty of local cafés and restaurants. Start your mornings off with coffee on the front porch, walk along the Mississippi River through the nearby Crescent Park, and later make your way over to the French Quarter by foot. From $235 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbThere’s no better location for taking in the finest New Orleans attractions than this Bourbon Street one-bedroom loft located in the city’s Central Business District. Visitors are a block away from the iconic neighborhood’s 24/7 energy and, when a break is in order, head two more blocks to the parks and squares that dot the French Quarter. If you’re in town for Mardi Gras, avail yourself of all the great perks in between street excursions: There’s a washer and dryer, a full-size kitchen, and an on-site gym to enjoy after you’ve peeled yourself away from the festive bars, restaurants, and parade routes. From $139 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbBetween the checkerboard kitchen tiles and the bedroom fireplace in this Victorian flat to the 12-foot ceilings in the dining room (complete with a chandelier), you’re in for a hell of a scenic stay here. At your temporary Garden District home, you have the place all to yourself, where you can dine in courtesy of a mint green Smeg fridge and gas stove. But when dining out is so easy (you’re within walking distance of restaurants, coffee shops, boutiques, plenty of parks, and more), we understand if you’re choosing to indulge. From $199 per night.Nestled right in the heart of the Uptown neighborhood, this two-bedroom Magic Cottage will give you a taste of Victorian flair with its original architectural details and two living rooms (one for relaxing, and another for pre-dinner drinks). The back patio features its own fountain and the front patio houses two Adirondack chairs, best used when sipping a cold drink and taking in the sounds of the city. Don’t miss catching some live music at the nearby Maple Leaf Bar. From $195 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbNew Orleans is packed with historic buildings and intriguing histories. At this charming home in the area of Marigny, you’ll be staying in an Airbnb that’s located on the second and third floors of a Creole corner store from the 1830s. Standout features include exposed brick that covers a significant portion of the apartment walls, along with a wraparound balcony, winding staircase, and wood accents throughout the kitchen, dining, and living areas. A quick walk to Frenchman Street makes this Airbnb a prime location. From $175 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbIf you prefer to vacation in spots with character, consider the Carlton Manor in New Orleans’s Uptown neighborhood. The condo owes its colorful palette and bright furnishings to designer Carlton Varney of Dorothy Draper, who decorated the space with funky palm leaf print wall paper and a palm leaf accent chair to match. Touches of green can be found throughout the space in a theme that includes an emerald green couch, green mirror, side table, and even a green diamond-patterned floor tile to tie it all together. From $151 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbThe main draw of this historic home is undoubtedly the picturesque saltwater pool where guests can take a refreshing dip after a long day of sight-seeing. You’ll also enjoy access to lounge chairs, an outdoor dining set up, and BBQ equipment should the weather call for dinner alfresco. When it’s time to take the party indoors, this one bedroom, one-and-a-half bathroom carriage house is flush with modern amenities, such as a full kitchen (complete with a coffee maker), air-conditioning, Wi-Fi, and cable TV. Located just around the bend from St. Charles Ave. and Audubon Park, the property also features free, on-street parking should you prefer a walking tour for leisurely taking in the local sites. From $195 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbSituated within walking distance of the French Quarter, Bourbon Street, Superdome, and the Ernest Moral Convention Center, this pet-friendly condo can comfortably fit up to six guests (as well as any furry friends) if you’re touring the city with friends and family. Velvet curtains flank the floor-to-ceiling windows for some earthy contrast, while a long sectional sofa invites you to spend a relaxing night sprawled out in front of the TV. This two-bedroom home offers cushy memory foam mattresses for guests to catch up on a sleep, with plenty of counter space for cheffing it up at home if you plan to dine in on your stay. From $194 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbSettle into this well-stocked stay located in the Lower Garden District that features a front porch straight out of a Southern novel and a grand staircase that dials up the opulence even further. Guests can end a day of sight-seeing and shopping around the French Quarter with a luxurious soak in the clawfoot tub, or try their hand at Cafe Du Monde’s world-famous beignets in the full chef’s kitchen. From $470 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbIt’s all shades of blue and mauve at this two-bedroom short-term rental in the historic Faubourg Treme neighborhood. Inside you’ll find refurbished hardwood floors, a plethora of design-forward light fixtures, kitschy-cool hardware, and lots of patterned accent chairs. The private apartment is a former citrus compound located within walking distance of Marigny and the French Quarter, and also features separate entrances to each bedroom so you never have to railroad through another space just to brush your teeth. From $316 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbThis sorbet-colored two-story home is located right along the streetcar path (you can’t miss it), so guests can venture to historic sites like Audubon Park or the French Quarter, as well as window shop along Magazine Street. You’ll be occupying the upstairs unit, which includes two cozy bedrooms plus a loft, as well as a large balcony for sipping your morning coffee as you take in some spectacular views of St. Charles. From $205 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbThe ornate fireplace is just the icing on the cake for this historic studio apartment that comes flush with vintage accents and an overhead fan to help you beat the swampy humidity in NOLA. The small size is ideal for a couples’ getaway or solo trip. And with such a central location on St. Charles Avenue, all of its restaurants, cafes, bars, and shops will be right at your fingertips. From $149 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbOur journey of the best New Orleans Airbnbs continues with a French-inspired apartment located in the Lower Garden District. Pop by MoJo Coffee House on your way to Magazine Street and be sure to soak up the charming architecture and rich history the city has to offer, all within walking distance. Inside this two-bedroom unit, floor-to-ceiling windows complement the renovated 1825 Victorian space while the 12-foot ceilings make way for an eye-catching chandelier and eclectic antiques. Be sure to take in the city’s captivating skyline by wrapping up your evenings with a nightcap on the private balcony. From $260 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbThis Garden District apartment is another historic property located on the second floor of a Victorian building built in 1875. Bask in an abundance of natural light with the unit’s high ceilings and expansive windows. The apartment has original hardwood floors, which set the stage for thoughtful modern and vintage furniture; a fiddle leaf fig tree as well as other touches of real plant life on the interior and exterior add to the garden district location to make this stay a plant lover’s haven.

Before joining AD she previously held roles at Business Insider and The Strategist.Read More13 Chairs That Changed the WorldThere’s so much more than most people know to the unexpected history of seatingWhy Prefab Architecture Could Be the Future – But Probably Won’t BeMichael Wyetzner of Michielli + Wyetzner Architects returns to AD to discuss prefab architecture and why it could be the future of housing–but probably won’t be. Prefabricated architecture has always posed a more affordable and sustainable future for housing as they’re fast and cheaper to build and produce less waste in the long run, so why hasn’t it taken over? Wyetzner delves into the history of prefab and why it failed to take off how many architects have hoped it would. ASSETS J. Paul Getty Trust. Getty Research InstituteTouring the ‘Doctor Odyssey’ Set With Joshua JacksonToday AD joins Joshua Jackson and production designer, Jamie Walker McCall, to tour the set of Ryan Murphy’s ‘Doctor Odyssey’. Bringing The Odyssey cruise ship to life was no mean feat–from a fully functioning pool on the leisure deck to the most stylish infirmary a doctor could ask for, this set creates a luxurious backdrop for all the show’s medical drama.Inside Paloma Elsesser’s Timeless Brooklyn HomeToday, AD is welcomed by supermodel Paloma Elsesser to tour her Brooklyn townhouse. An illustrious modeling career means Elsesser is often jet-setting the globe, and as a result, her time at home has become her vacation time. Brooklyn was always where the supermodel wanted to end up setting up home, with Gregory Rockwell and Hester Hodde of Gregory Rockwell Interiors helping bring her oasis to life. Her home takes its cues from Milan design, mixing vintage and artisanal pieces, a style Elsesser has been drawn to since her many travels to Italy’s fashion capital. As the model settles into her dream home, it’s already been a place of great personal evolution–“I feel like I became a woman here,” she admits. “I learned to navigate so many things—a breakup, a contractor, having agency over my decisions and my money. I’m under no one else’s jurisdiction. It’s scary, but also very freeing.”Inside Kendall Jenner’s Home at ChristmasToday, AD is welcomed back by Kendall Jenner to tour her LA home while it’s decorated for Christmas. Over the years, the Kardashian-Jenner clan has become known for their flamboyant Christmas decorations but Kendall’s approach to holiday decorating is much more traditional. With the help of florist to the stars, Jeff Leatham, green garlands, a classic tree, and vintage decorations lace the halls of her home creating a nostalgic atmosphere. Much of this nostalgia stems from decorations from Kendall’s childhood handed down from her mom Kris–most notably her collection of Christopher Radko tree ornaments. “Growing up with [those ornaments] every year, they became so special to me,” she says. “And I can’t wait to share that with my kids one day, but I love sharing this with my friends. I love entertaining, I love hosting, and so these decorations get used really well.” 2024 Helen Frankenthaler Foundation, Inc. / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New YorkInterior Designer Explains Every Decision Behind This SoHo Loft RenovationToday, AD welcomes interior designer Darren Jett to tour one of his most recent design projects, a full Soho loft renovation. From structural changes to interior design, every decision matters when renovating a space–Jett breaks down how he landed on the final design and what factored into his choices.Interior Designer Answers Your Top Design QuestionsToday, AD100 designer David Netto joins Architectural Digest to answer your burning interior design questions.

An illustrious modeling career means Elsesser is often jet-setting the globe, and as a result, her time at home has become her vacation time. Brooklyn was always where the supermodel wanted to end up setting up home, with Gregory Rockwell and Hester Hodde of Gregory Rockwell Interiors helping bring her oasis to life. Her home takes its cues from Milan design, mixing vintage and artisanal pieces, a style Elsesser has been drawn to since her many travels to Italy’s fashion capital. As the model settles into her dream home, it’s already been a place of great personal evolution–“I feel like I became a woman here,” she admits. “I learned to navigate so many things—a breakup, a contractor, having agency over my decisions and my money. I’m under no one else’s jurisdiction.

Over the years, the Kardashian-Jenner clan has become known for their flamboyant Christmas decorations but Kendall’s approach to holiday decorating is much more traditional. With the help of florist to the stars, Jeff Leatham, green garlands, a classic tree, and vintage decorations lace the halls of her home creating a nostalgic atmosphere. Much of this nostalgia stems from decorations from Kendall’s childhood handed down from her mom Kris–most notably her collection of Christopher Radko tree ornaments. “Growing up with [those ornaments] every year, they became so special to me,” she says. “And I can’t wait to share that with my kids one day, but I love sharing this with my friends. I love entertaining, I love hosting, and so these decorations get used really well.”\n\n2024 Helen Frankenthaler Foundation, Inc. / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-item=\"{\u0026#34;dangerousHed\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Interior Designer Explains Every Decision Behind This SoHo Loft Renovation\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;index\u0026#34;:6,\u0026#34;contentType\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;venue\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;hotelLink\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.architecturaldigest.com/video/watch/behind-the-design-interior-designer-explains-every-decision-behind-this-soho-loft-renovation#intcid=_architectural-digest-gallery-bottom-recirc_60cb216b-42c8-4c13-bac7-c17e22973a73_roberta-similarity1\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;GridFourColumns\u0026#34;}\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ca data-component-type=\"recirc-river\" data-recirc-id=\"item-hed-7\" data-recirc-pattern=\"summary-item\" href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/video/watch/behind-the-design-interior-designer-explains-every-decision-behind-this-soho-loft-renovation#intcid=_architectural-digest-gallery-bottom-recirc_60cb216b-42c8-4c13-bac7-c17e22973a73_roberta-similarity1\" target=\"_self\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"ClampWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterior Designer Explains Every Decision Behind This SoHo Loft Renovation\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, AD welcomes interior designer Darren Jett to tour one of his most recent design projects, a full Soho loft renovation.
