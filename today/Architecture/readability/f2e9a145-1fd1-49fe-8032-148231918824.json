  "text": "LA Almazara: symbolic architecture in rondaDesigner and architect Philippe Starck has unveiled his latest project, LA Almazara, a minimalist and abstract structure located in Ronda, a town in Spain‘s southern region of Andalusia. Known for his inventive and often provocative designs, Starck approaches this project with a focus on essentials, creating a space that invites visitors to experience something transformative. The result is a work that strips away excess, leaving only raw materials and symbolic elements that echo the cultural and natural landscape of its surroundings. Ronda is an historic town perched dramatically along a deep gorge, surrounded by the scenic countryside of Andalusia. The region is known for its olive oil production, bullfighting heritage, and blend of Moorish and Spanish architecture. Ronda’s rugged cliffs and distant views of rolling hills lend a postcard backdrop for Starck’s LA Almazara, which draws inspiration from this dramatic landscape.Philippe Starck writes: ‘LA Almazara is an extraordinary, incredible and miraculous place in which visitors envoy a powerful, radical experience that challenges and transforms. It is an accumulation of mysteries where the crystallised respect of olive oil is mixed with emotion.’LA Almazara is a minimalist, radical work by Philippe Starck in Ronda, Andalusia | images © minimalism infused with abstract symbolismPhilippe Starck notes that the heart of LA Almazara in Ronda is its minimalism. The architecture is stripped of ornamentation, where every element serves a purpose. The French designer envisioned a monolithic red cube, an unadorned, geometric shape that stands out against the Andalusian landscape. There are no claddings or decorative details — the focus is instead on clarity and raw materiality. Starck emphasizes the essentials, achieving a structure that feels both timeless and starkly modern.A large steel bull’s horn and a concrete eye spewing black smoke dominate the exterior of the building. Starck uses these elements to evoke the spirit of Andalusian surrealism, referencing great artists from the region. The horn and eye are abstract, intended to provoke thought and reflection. The smoke acts as a metaphorical ‘look’ or thought, extending the building’s symbolic language into the surrounding landscape.the structure is a monolithic red cube with no cladding or ornamental finishesphilippe starck learns from andalusian heritageCurating the interiors of LA Almazara, Philippe Starck designs a series of unexpected and dramatic surprises, each paying homage to elements of Spanish culture and history. A half olive is embedded in a rusted steel wall, clearly a nod to the olive oil tradition of the region, while a metal pipe appears to penetrate the building without an exit. The space is filled with oversized objects that challenge conventional design logic, including a massive bullfighting sword and an enormous portrait of a famous matador from Ronda. These sculptural interventions invite visitors to engage with the interior on a symbolic level, finding connections between the art, objects, and the history of the region.Beyond the built space, Philippe Starck’s vision extends to the Ronda landscape surrounding LA Almazara. A rectangle of light illuminates the interior and draws the eye outward to a terrace, suspended by metal chains. This terrace opens up to the dramatic views of Ronda’s scenic natural context, cinematically framing the countryside. Starck maintains a balance between the building and its environment, planting olive trees and creating spaces for visitors to wander through the groves and green alcoves. Nature becomes part of the experience as visitors are guided through a romantic journey among the trees.symbolic elements include a steel bull’s horn and concrete eye spewing smokeStarck draws inspiration from Andalusian surrealism and local cultural referencesother interior features include a half olive and an enormous portrait of a famous matador",
