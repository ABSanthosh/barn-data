However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.When it comes to uncovering the most beautiful spaces, you could say that we here at AD have insight into the best hotels in the world. Our editors’ expertise stems from constant study of the landscape and frequent travel to design weeks, including the likes of NYCxDesign and Design Miami and Art Basel every year to learn about the latest trends in art, design, and architecture. Plus, our staffers vacation in stylish, design-forward spots on their trips, many that are featured in this piece.From seaside escapes to serene inns tucked away in the mountains, we’ve found lodging for every type of stay. Each location is teeming with design details that are reminiscent of everything from Old-world, Parisian-style apartments to industrial-inspired suites in bustling cities.With what seems like an endless array of hotels across the globe, we’re giving you a look into several standouts. Scroll below to discover the 16 best our editors have traveled to in recent months.Courtesy of Mandarin OrientalMandarin Oriental in Lake Como, ItalyAfter a week traveling around Florence and venturing on various wine- and gelato-fueled day trips to towns around Tuscany, my family and I were beginning to lose the sense of ‘vacation’ on our activities-heavy trip to Italy. We were in need of some true R\u0026R, and our four-day stay at the Mandarin Oriental in Lake Como to finish off the trip was just what the doctor ordered.With the beauty of Lake Como just outside the window, I wasn’t expecting to be so enamored with the interiors. Walking into the palatial lobby, I was greeted by gilded wallpaper, marble floors, and boundless vases of bouquets, while ceiling reliefs and romanesque columns paid tribute to the rich history of Italian art and architecture.Positioned right on the water, the property makes the most of its exterior space with pristine landscaping and plenty of al fresco dining. The jewel of the hotel is the floating pool on the banks of the lake. (Yes, you heard that right.) An infinity-style design gives the illusion of swimming directly in the lake while having greater control of the cleanliness and temperature. Rain was in the forecast for every single day of my family’s stay, and yet we still spent every moment we could out by the pool, laying out on the chaise lounges to read a book, get a drink, or just enjoy the otherworldly scenery.While the stormy skies didn’t let us revel in Lake Como’s beauty as much as we’d have liked, we got lucky with a clear afternoon during a wooden boat tour of the area. Straight from the hotel docks, our captain showed us around the various villas and properties dotted around the lake, peppering in some historical and pop-culture factoids, like how the idyllic Villa Balbianello was featured in the Star Wars prequel films. Beyond the architecture, further north along the lake you’re able to catch a glimpse of the Alps that feed Lake Como’s waters peeking out from behind the lower-lying hills.The turbulent weather turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because it meant we utilized the hotel’s amenities tenfold. Topping that list was the luxurious spa that included several pools, two saunas, a steam room, and a myriad of services from facials to massage. Over the four days, it felt like we were able to enjoy just about everything the property had to offer with time to spare. That sense of ease extended to us enjoying all our meals on-site. Just because we had left wine country didn't mean the dining options were an afterthought. Three restaurants on the property kept us well-fed with inventive takes on Italian classics, two with Asian-inspired fusion menus. Between the scenery, the spa, and the food, our stay was idyllic in all senses—the perfect way to wind down and commemorate the end of our trip. —Lauren Arzbaecher, commerce producerCourtesy of Pátio do TijoloPátio Do Tijolo in Lisboa, PortugalPátio do Tijolo is Lisbon's sleek and charming oasis set between two vibrant neighborhoods, the bustling Bairo Alto and the super-stylish Principe Real. The hotel is fairly low-key but high in industrial chic design. Concrete walls meet stunning emerald green terracotta tiles in the most perfect juxtaposition of modern and traditional decor. After spending four days at Patio Do Tijolo, we left for our Airbnb in nearby Sintra. We reluctantly said goodbye to the helpful staff and the comfort of our lovely room but after our return flight was canceled, we decided to return to Lisbon and the laid-back comfort of Pátio.Michael ShomeMichael ShomeThe complimentary breakfast is absolutely delicious. Served in a sun-drenched dining nook, a daily feast of the most delicious Pasteis de Nata, fresh locally grown fruits, and a selection of rich Portuguese cheeses is not to be missed. There is also a stunning courtyard that insulates the full property and provides an easy indoor/outdoor respite right outside your room. Though limited in services like in-room dining, the cost-effective hotel prioritizes simplicity over luxury. The young staff is extremely knowledgeable and offer invaluable insider tips on what to do in the surrounding neighborhoods. —Michael Shome, global visuals directorNômade Hotel in Tulum, MexicoThe Nômade Hotel in Tulum, Mexico, offers a complete escape, blending Yucatán’s lush jungle and Tulum’s earthy architecture with North African-inspired textiles and color palettes. Dramatic pathways carved through vibrant foliage connect private sections of the hotel, and the abundance of trees creates a magical atmosphere as you walk through. Upon entering, the hotel’s maze-like trails hide surprises around every turn.As someone who visits Tulum annually, I can confidently say Nômade is one of the beach zone’s most exclusive establishments. The boho-chic environment is a sanctuary for wellness, design, music, and food. I was fortunate to stay at Nômade for two nights in 2021, and since then, I always return to its beach club whenever I’m in town. Despite my short stay, every moment felt stunning.While there’s so much to see in Tulum, Nômade’s relaxing atmosphere and accommodating staff create a haven that feels like a home away from home, leaving me little reason to venture elsewhere. I spent most of my time at the hotel’s private beach club and beachfront restaurant, La Popular, where locally sourced seafood is served on minimalist ceramic plates. Each afternoon, a DJ played a mix of tribal deep house music (very Tulum), drawing a diverse group of international guests to lounge on low tables, cushions, and rugs while enjoying the communal vibe. A signature feature at the beach club is the picturesque teepee triangle sculpture with netted rope where guests can relax. Other amenities include a spa, multiple pools, Japanese and Mediterranean dining options, and a gratitude tent for ceremonies, yoga, and wellness sessions.Finally, the rooms are a dream! Options range from treehouses and bungalows to villas and beachfront suites, all defined by minimalistic architecture that incorporates locally sourced wood, stone, and concrete with eco-friendly principles. Interiors feature handcrafted decor that merges luxury with rustic charm. I am completely enchanted by this hotel and wholeheartedly recommend it to all Tulum visitors. —Andrea Lewis, assistant to the global editorial directorPhoto: Lawrence BraunHemlock Neversink in Catskills, New YorkLast winter I spent the weekend at Hemlock Neversink, a beautiful property in upstate New York. My first impression of Hemlock Neversink was its impressive size. A winding road leads you through the forest past a serene lake and a cute goat barn, eventually arriving at the main building. The lobby is beautifully decorated, and you’re welcomed with a glass of homemade apple cider to enjoy as you check in.I stayed at Hemlock Neversink for two nights and three days, which felt like the ideal amount of time. The hotel is fully inclusive, offering a curated itinerary based on your preferences with activities, amenities, and three delicious meals a day. Activities ranged from yoga classes and forest hikes with the resident goats to watercolor painting, s’mores bonfires, and artisanal honey tastings that perfectly captured the upstate vibe. The property also features a gorgeous indoor pool, hot tub, and a thoughtfully designed relaxation room replete with soothing music, books, and art supplies. Additionally, they offer spa treatments that can be booked separately, and they’re well worth it.Another highlight from the stay was the excellent food. Each day, the chef crafted a new menu with locally sourced ingredients. Overall, Hemlock Neversink exceeded my expectations. The staff went above and beyond to meet every need, and all of the included activities and amenities made it such a memorable upstate getaway. —Shani Kravetz, associate visuals editorCourtesy of Rosewood Villa MagnaRosewood Villa Magna in Madrid, SpainThe Rosewood Villa Magna is a beauty—a historic 1970s edifice reimagined by architect Ramón de Arana whose grid of windows light up at night. The facades are rigorous yet refined, giving way to luxurious but by no means in-your-face interiors. Public spaces are upscale but not overwrought, with lots of inviting seating and dining spaces. Refreshingly, there are no heavy-handed invitations for Instagram selfies—understatement being part of what makes this hotel so classy. Restaurants and bars are a hit with locals and guests alike, making the lobby feel like a true living room to the surrounding Salamanca district.My stay was brief—just two nights at the beginning of a weeklong trip through Spain. That’s barely enough time to scratch the surface of this great European capital, with its world-class museums and cosmopolitan glamor. But it was enough to immerse myself in the excellent vibes at Villa Magna.I really enjoyed the location, which was convenient to the city’s attractions but also peripheral enough to feel like you are brushing up against undiscovered local shops and restaurants and markets. The hotel itself had lots of art to discover on site. My favorite was the stained-glass installation in the stairwell. And the spa was a sublime escape. Don’t miss the steam room and soaking tub. —Sam Cochran, global features editorCourtesy of Hotel SacherHotel Sacher in Vienna, AustriaAt a time when so many hotels are succumbing to the insidious forces of minimalism and beige, Hotel Sacher is a delightful kaleidoscope of decorative flourishes, its classically appointed rooms harking back to the Vienna of a bygone era. My eyes gleefully flittered among the many gilded furnishings, opulent light fixtures, and damask wall treatments. You’ll want to explore every room—from the Blaue Bar (perfect for a nightcap) to the Grüne Bar (where I took my breakfast each morning). The hotel first opened in 1876 and is rightfully proud of its venerable legacy, evidence of which can be found in the many photographs of famous past guests.I had the improbable privilege of staying in the presidential suite, whose accommodations were so vast that I only discovered one bathroom moments before leaving for the airport. I may have only been there for three nights but I made the absolute most of them, sipping cocktails in different lounges, having dinner at the Rote Bar restaurant, and checking out a production of Carmen at the opera house across the street. After days pounding the Viennese pavement, running from museum to museum, I was delighted to have such a plush place to lay my head.No trip would be complete, of course, without trying the famous Sacher-Torte, a decadent chocolate cake layered with apricot jam and chocolate icing. Old-world indulgences are part of the fun at Hotel Sacher and, of course, much of the fun in Vienna. —Sam Cochran, global features editorPhoto: Anthony MairThe Bellagio (MGM Resorts) in Las Vegas, NevadaI know a casino may be an unexpected answer, but my stay at the Bellagio this summer was by far one of my most memorable trips, even as someone who has gone to Vegas many times—it encapsulated exactly what I had pictured when I imagined the most whimsical, camp, glamorous reprieve in Sin City.I stayed for four nights and five days and had the most action-packed daily schedule, even on the days that I didn't leave the casino's premises. There were so many elements of Vegas I had never considered, specifically the art—I saw some of my favorite Daniel Arsham pieces to date at the Perrotin gallery location, as well as a deeply thoughtful photography exhibit on China's cultural evolution in the past three decades at the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art. I also attended the most incredible shows in the casino (which says a lot, given that I also saw Lady Gaga's jazz residency and Dead and Co's Sphere show in the same week—my standards are high!) My favorites were O by Cirque du Soleil (which I saw for the third time—each time astounds me more and more), as well as the house band managed by drummer Daniel Foose at the Pinky Ring.The most unforgettable meal I had (out of many) was at the Mayfair Supper Club, a whimsical underwater themed supper club designed by AD100 designer Martin Brudnizki. I felt like I was at an opulent nautical party at Gatsby's as I feasted on a late-night seafood tower, creative cocktails, and other samplers, as burlesque dancers and acrobats swung from the ceilings and danced on tabletops with a view of the electrifying fountain show. And then the most unforgettable bar I went to (again, out of many) not just in Vegas but honestly ever, was a discreet invite-only speakeasy called The Vault, designed by Studio Munge. These experiences at the Bellagio encapsulated Vegas' ability to transport, entertain, and offer a reprieve from the real world, and the way it has birthed its own cultural cannon—I truly felt like I was in a different time and world during my unforgettable stay. —Livia Caligor, US content operations managerSquire Tarbox Inn in Westport, MaineI was instantly struck by the considered and unique design of the Squire Tarbox Inn. It has a classic Maine farmhouse feel updated with Western details (one of the owners is from Texas) and a dark New England exterior that’s full of surprises like a vintage cowhide dresser in the lobby. The dining space reminded me of a Virginia tavern with its low ceilings, wooden beams, Windsor chairs, and a big fireplace with a large tin serving tray on the mantle.It brought together a lot of the East Coast themes I love and replicate in my own home while integrating the Southwestern details that draw me, such as fur, hide, and antique brass details. The gardens are also lush and beautiful, and a big red barn sits adjacent to the inn where they hold parties and events.I stayed a week at the Inn with my friend Molly, who was the breakfast chef, where I not only got to enjoy the inn's extensive grounds (there’s a beautiful pathway that leads down to a marsh) and facilities, but also meet the staff and help with the breakfast service. The dining room made brunch conversation with the other guests a really special part of the stay.The inn’s location is another special perk—it feels remote and peaceful on its part of Westport Island, but isn't far from Wiscasset, where a lot of Maine's summer action happens. The access to nature makes it a perfect New England getaway, and the sound of the crickets at night is something I miss especially living in the city. The hotel beyond met my expectations! I hope to go back this coming summer. —Julia Harrison, commerce writerCourtesy of Hôtel Barrière Le Fouquet'sHôtel Barrière Le Fouquet's in Paris, FranceThis hotel made me feel like I stepped into a dream in Paris. Everything was steeped in luxury. The glamor, the details, the richness of textiles and materials…I wanted to explore every inch of the building.I stayed for two days and two nights, since I felt like I needed at least a week to soak up all the pleasures of the hotel. Even in a short amount of time, I was impressed by my stay. I was able to bask in the incredible pool and sauna, I ate the best French cuisine at the restaurant, and could step outside the front door and instantly be immersed in the magic of the city.The private pool beneath the Champs-Élysées, surrounded by a series of paintings and ancient sculptures, is truly wonderful. I felt like I was in another realm, not just at the lower level of the building. I also loved touring the exception suites. Designed by Jacques Garcia as Parisian apartments, the grand spaces feature incredible views and amazing amenities like glam rooms and photo studios. Every detail felt impossibly chic and well-appointed. I wanted to live in the hotel.The grandeur and luxuriousness was 10 out of 10. I was treated like royalty and slept incredibly well. If you want to really splurge in Paris, this is an absolute winner. —Zoë Sessums, senior digital design editorPhoto: Pascal PronnierHotel Le Majestic in Cannes, FranceBetween the proximity of the red-carpeted steps of the Palais des Festivals and the shimmering blue of the Mediterranean Sea, Le Majestic gives off the impression of luxury and magnificence. The second I saw the building and stepped on the property I could tell this was a five-star hotel.I only stayed for two days and two nights, but despite my short stay, I experienced the best of the hotel’s offerings. From enjoying a fresh, exquisite room service breakfast at the open balcony—with views of the sea, of course—to touring the breathtakingly chic penthouse where I could envision every famous actor getting ready for their red carpet appearance, and even swimming in the relaxing pool, every element of the stay was supreme.The private beach and spa were my favorite amenities at Le Majestic. I was able to bask in the sunshine, swim in the ocean, and get an outstanding facial in the span of a couple of hours, all within a short walk to my room. I really felt like I was taken care of and could enjoy a variety of activities without thinking too much or planning too extensively—which is ideal for me when I stay at a hotel.Le Majestic was built nearly 100 years ago, so it clearly feels full of history and wonder. The best part is the way the staff is excited to talk about the storied past and the constant improvements to the property. It feels both fresh and filled with history all at once. Overall, the hotel far exceeded my expectations. If you seek luxury, this won’t disappoint. —Zoë Sessums, senior digital design editorPhoto: Robert Rieger, Courtesy of EnnismoreThe Hoxton in Southwark, LondonThere’s something about The Hoxton, no matter the location, that has this charming, comfortable, chic air about it. I’ve stayed in the Hoxton in Rome, London, and New York, and you can count on them all having a nice air of familiarity about them. I always get an upbeat, clean, and lively feeling.I stayed at this hotel for three days and three nights, where I was able to try out a variety of food at the restaurant from breakfast to dinner. I stayed for a drink at the bar and settled in each night for a quiet, peaceful stay. I loved the proximity to the Tate Modern and River Thames.The innovative part about the Hoxton Southwark is their extensive coworking space, Working From. The place has library desks, phone booths, and daybeds for working and thinking. There are also incredible views of the city and even a rooftop wellness studio and stocked pantry. It’s an ideal location for people who are working while they travel or even just someone trying to finish a creative project.The hotel and stay was perfect for the kind of working while visiting a new city trip that I was on. It was reliable, easy to be based at, and had luxurious touches to keep me impressed. —Zoë Sessums, senior digital design editorCourtesy of The WestonThe Weston in Weston, VermontYou approach the Weston via a long and windy mountain road, making for a dramatic arrival when you pull up to its inviting, white picketed porches and lovely grounds. I stayed for two really quiet and cozy nights during a cold spell that wasn't cold enough for skiing, but gave me plenty of time to dine at the onsite restaurant and take in a spa treatment and a nearby hike. The Green Mountains are lovely all year round, but I'd love to see the Weston in its summer splendor or during leaf-peeping season! That said, two nights was definitely long enough to relax and take in the beautiful surroundings.The service at this hotel is top-notch. The family who owns the Weston ran the legendary Carlyle in New York for decades, so they are no stranger to high-end amenities and demanding guests (for example, my dog). The property is small enough that the staff knows your name and can give you personalized recommendations—including at the restaurant. They also set up a beautiful layout for my aforementioned dog with bowls, a bed, and toys for her. Ultimately, though, I think what I enjoyed the most about the Weston is the homey, quintessentially New England decor. No detail was left unconsidered on the property and it felt like the most elevated version of the vacation home you've always wanted.Because of the inclement weather, we ended up spending most of our time enjoying the room, the spa, and the grounds. It was the cozy Vermont getaway I'd dreamed of after booking my stay. —Rachel Fletcher, commerce directorCourtesy of The HensonThe Henson in Hensonville, New YorkDriving through tiny little towns in the Catskills, you don't necessarily expect to see an elevated hideaway like The Henson tucked away on an ordinary country road. It's elegant and well-appointed—the check-in area is chock-full of vintage and reclaimed wood with a gorgeous, seasonal bouquet of dahlias at the centerpiece. Each room unfolds with similar drama and elegance as you tour the property.I stayed for the weekend at the end of the summer and it was still quite new but there were almost no hiccups to speak of—I definitely think I experienced a beautiful time at The Henson and think it would be a great retreat really any time of year.Aside from the chic decor, the best element of my stay was absolutely the onsite restaurant, Matilda. It's run by chefs Jeremiah Stone and Fabian von Hauske Valtierra, the men behind Wildair and Bar Contra, and it has the level of sophistication you'd expect from two Manhattan restaurateurs balanced with the warmth of the Catskills. Though pricey—options can be limited in the area—the food and cocktails are phenomenal and worth a trip alone. Breakfast is served at a diner down the street that The Henson now owns (guests get vouchers for free meals) and is absolutely adorable.I felt I saw something new and beautiful everywhere I turned at the Henson. The backyard features gardens where herbs are grown for the restaurant and a walking trail borders the property. The roofdeck makes for a beautiful view of the rolling mountains and a chance to sip your morning coffee. While the rooms are spare (no mini fridge, tub, or walk-in closets) they're tastefully decorated and feature all of the essentials, and pretty much everything you need can be found on-site. It's a beautiful landing pad for everything the Catskills has to offer. —Rachel Fletcher, commerce directorPhoto: Christophe CoenonLa Perouse in Nice, FranceI loved the charming interiors designed by Virginie Friedmann and Delphine Versace of the Paris-based Friedmann \u0026 Versace Studio. From the natural rattan and wicker touches, to the colorful tiled tables, to the charming stained glass in the dining room, it has all the design hallmarks of the South of France. Plus, nothing beats the Mediterranean sea right out the window. I stayed there for three nights at the beginning of a South of France road trip. It was just the right amount of time to explore the city.I also loved the location, which is in the city's old town. The hotel is actually nestled into the limestone face of Castle Hill (Colline du Château) which you can climb to the top for the best view in the city. It's right on the water, a short walk to many restaurants, and, to our delight, just steps from the flea market on Sunday morning. I would absolutely stay there when I return to Nice. —Hannah Martin, senior design editorPhoto: Fampiano KraniotisCali Mykonos in Mykonos, GreeceI once thought, in the world of Instagram and TikTok, that few places lived up to, let alone exceeded, the hype. That was until I visited Cali Mykonos. My first stay at the 40-room retreat coincided with my first trip to Mykonos altogether. ‘Watch out for all of the crazy partiers,’ warned those who learned of my upcoming travels. How wrong they proved to be, as Cali Mykonos—which is a family-run resort located on a quiet nook along the island’s eastern coast—is a sanctuary of the highest order nestled within an archipelago known for harboring such escapes. The resort’s white-washed villas and impeccably designed rooms, which feature spectacular views of the sea, are the epitome of postcard envy. But many five-star properties include similar features.What, to my mind, truly separates Cali Mykonos is their commitment to detail, which is not experienced so much as felt through their impeccable service and first-rate cuisine. After my trip to Greece, I learned that some believe the Greeks had two meanings for the word utopia: Eutopos meant the good place, while utopos was the place that could never be. This family-operated hotel and the talented team at Cali Mykonos have reshaped what a five-star resort can be by promising that the good place does, in fact, exist—because they’ve created it. —Nick Mafi, senior features editorPhoto: Francine ZaslowThe Maker Hotel in Hudson, New YorkLocated on Warren Street, the main artery of Hudson, the Maker is well-situated for the town’s best restaurants and shopping (Ipsum, Freaks, Red Chair, and Battle Brown are my personal faves). It also smells amazing—little surprise, given that the hotel was founded by the creators of French beauty brand Fresh. The room I stayed in was spacious and expertly decorated, with art aplenty and a roaring fireplace. The attention to detail at this hotel is off the charts—expect to have a copy of the newspaper and coffee (with your creamer of choice) at your door first thing in the morning, and a CBD/melatonin edible and tea at turndown service. Chef’s kiss.I had a two-night stay at the hotel, which was enough time to get in a visit to the hotel’s bar, sample their house perfumes(!), and enjoy some time working in their library and cafe. (Speaking of the latter—the pastries are not to be missed.)Hudson has become a go-to destination for antiquing—and anyone visiting the region to partake in it will find a haven at the Maker. Each room has its own theme, like “The Gardener” (where I stayed) or “The Architect,” and is beautifully appointed with unusual, unique finds. If you’re curious about the stories behind them, their age, or their provenance, the Maker is one step ahead of you, as you’ll find all of the above detailed in their app.Like I mentioned earlier, the attention to detail and level of hospitality you’ll find here is hard to beat. If you’re a big TV watcher though, you might be better off elsewhere, as rooms do not have televisions by default. (For me, this was a plus, but it might deter some—still, you can use the room iPad or request a screen if you’re desperate for a fix.) This is my go-to hotel for the Hudson Valley! —Lila Allen, associate director, AD PRO",

Walking into the palatial lobby, I was greeted by gilded wallpaper, marble floors, and boundless vases of bouquets, while ceiling reliefs and romanesque columns paid tribute to the rich history of Italian art and architecture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003ePositioned right on the water, the property makes the most of its exterior space with pristine landscaping and plenty of al fresco dining. The jewel of the hotel is the floating pool on the banks of the lake. (Yes, you heard that right.) An infinity-style design gives the illusion of swimming directly in the lake while having greater control of the cleanliness and temperature. Rain was in the forecast for every single day of my family’s stay, and yet we still spent every moment we could out by the pool, laying out on the chaise lounges to read a book, get a drink, or just enjoy the otherworldly scenery.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the stormy skies didn’t let us revel in Lake Como’s beauty as much as we’d have liked, we got lucky with a clear afternoon during a wooden boat tour of the area. Straight from the hotel docks, our captain showed us around the various villas and properties dotted around the lake, peppering in some historical and pop-culture factoids, like how the idyllic Villa Balbianello was featured in the \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e prequel films. Beyond the architecture, further north along the lake you’re able to catch a glimpse of the Alps that feed Lake Como’s waters peeking out from behind the lower-lying hills.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe turbulent weather turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because it meant we utilized the hotel’s amenities tenfold. Topping that list was the luxurious spa that included several pools, two saunas, a steam room, and a myriad of services from facials to massage. Over the four days, it felt like we were able to enjoy just about everything the property had to offer with time to spare. That sense of ease extended to us enjoying all our meals on-site. Just because we had left wine country didn\u0026#39;t mean the dining options were an afterthought. Three restaurants on the property kept us well-fed with inventive takes on Italian classics, two with Asian-inspired fusion menus. Between the scenery, the spa, and the food, our stay was idyllic in all senses—the perfect way to wind down and commemorate the end of our trip. —\u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/contributor/lauren-arzbaecher\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLauren Arzbaecher\u003c/a\u003e, commerce producer\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr/\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Pátio do Tijolo\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca data-offer-url=\"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189158-d26443006-Reviews-Patio_do_Tijolo-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html\" data-event-click=\"{\u0026#34;element\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;ExternalLink\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;outgoingURL\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2Km7iGSohMTaq67jfDfaov7j2aeGifXv4NpXEefXh5yNVzo6Q68f5W6cQy1oHRfFYsYnfo5xRCLXBcEXFPeSkHKmVHNdvJsw2mB3CsViaqgjJbrVZpX73gBKESeCSDnWszQs7zfpUUsykjsWVb5BiiZ7E57o8hM2bntGcranvH9UvtUNcB69dfEnjqBRuxNypHKhMnDiyfb3MhdbHbue6NYzdKamP1cxS9ofqwdkD26nNa7BJ2Ey6hdF481rzY4CthHq\u0026#34;}\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2Km7iGSohMTaq67jfDfaov7j2aeGifXv4NpXEefXh5yNVzo6Q68f5W6cQy1oHRfFYsYnfo5xRCLXBcEXFPeSkHKmVHNdvJsw2mB3CsViaqgjJbrVZpX73gBKESeCSDnWszQs7zfpUUsykjsWVb5BiiZ7E57o8hM2bntGcranvH9UvtUNcB69dfEnjqBRuxNypHKhMnDiyfb3MhdbHbue6NYzdKamP1cxS9ofqwdkD26nNa7BJ2Ey6hdF481rzY4CthHq\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePátio Do Tijolo in Lisboa, Portugal\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003ePátio do Tijolo is Lisbon\u0026#39;s sleek and charming oasis set between two vibrant neighborhoods, the bustling Bairo Alto and the super-stylish Principe Real.

I spent most of my time at the hotel’s private beach club and beachfront restaurant, La Popular, where locally sourced seafood is served on minimalist ceramic plates. Each afternoon, a DJ played a mix of tribal deep house music (very Tulum), drawing a diverse group of international guests to lounge on low tables, cushions, and rugs while enjoying the communal vibe. A signature feature at the beach club is the picturesque teepee triangle sculpture with netted rope where guests can relax. Other amenities include a spa, multiple pools, Japanese and Mediterranean dining options, and a gratitude tent for ceremonies, yoga, and wellness sessions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, the rooms are a dream! Options range from treehouses and bungalows to villas and beachfront suites, all defined by minimalistic architecture that incorporates locally sourced wood, stone, and concrete with eco-friendly principles.

The property is small enough that the staff knows your name and can give you personalized recommendations—including at the restaurant. They also set up a beautiful layout for my aforementioned dog with bowls, a bed, and toys for her. Ultimately, though, I think what I enjoyed the most about the Weston is the homey, quintessentially New England decor. No detail was left unconsidered on the property and it felt like the most elevated version of the vacation home you\u0026#39;ve always wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause of the inclement weather, we ended up spending most of our time enjoying the room, the spa, and the grounds.

That was until I visited Cali Mykonos. My first stay at the 40-room retreat coincided with my first trip to Mykonos altogether. ‘Watch out for all of the crazy partiers,’ warned those who learned of my upcoming travels. How wrong they proved to be, as Cali Mykonos—which is a family-run resort located on a quiet nook along the island’s eastern coast—is a sanctuary of the highest order nestled within an archipelago known for harboring such escapes. The resort’s white-washed villas and impeccably designed rooms, which feature spectacular views of the sea, are the epitome of postcard envy. But many five-star properties include similar features.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat, to my mind, truly separates Cali Mykonos is their commitment to detail, which is not experienced so much as felt through their impeccable service and first-rate cuisine.
