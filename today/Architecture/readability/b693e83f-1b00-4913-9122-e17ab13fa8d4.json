  "text": "Rounded layers of smooth cement plaster take cues from traditional stone-carved architecture at TropiBox, a home in Kerala, India, designed by local studio Tropical Architecture Bureau. Located in the city of Kochi, TropiBox is informed by the architecture of tropical modernism – a style developed in the late 1940s as a blending of European modernism with the vernacular techniques of tropical regions. Drawing on this style in response to Kochi's hot climate, Tropical Architecture Bureau (TAB) organised the home around a series of internal courtyards and planters, wrapped by curved walls formed of smooth layers of cement plaster. Tropical Architecture Bureau has completed a cement-plastered home in Kerala\"Inspired by tropical modernism, the design incorporates minimalist lines and natural textures, enhanced by the raw beauty of wood, stone, and concrete,\" TAB founder Uvais Subu told Dezeen. \"By using smooth, flowing curves and layered cement plaster, the design achieves a futuristic feel while incorporating minimalistic carvings that pay homage to the region's rich heritage.\" Entered via a covered porch area and living room, TropiBox steps down into a double-height kitchen and dining space at its centre, which is illuminated by a circular skylight. The home is organised around a series of internal courtyards and plantersTo the south of this space, sliding glass doors lead out onto a small patio and swimming pool, while to the north and west sides the living area opens out onto planted courtyards partially sheltered by metal canopies. A black staircase, framed by a section of rough stone-clad wall, leads up to the first floor, where three bedrooms are organised around an upper living area overlooking the ground floor from an L-shaped balcony. \"The layout fosters family interaction through open sightlines and interconnected spaces, while still offering each inhabitant their own private retreat,\" said Subu. \"The central dining area, with its double-height skylight, serves as a gathering point that connects the kitchen, courtyard, and pool, allowing for immersive views of nature from multiple angles and enhancing Kerala's tropical greenery,\" he added. A double-height kitchen and dining space sit at the home's centreThe mixture of tradition and modernity continues on the interior of TropiBox. Areas of irregularly-paved flooring are contrasted by smooth stone paving, while rough-plastered walls meet crisp metal window frames and canopies. Built-in elements such as a stone-clad, steel-topped kitchen island sit alongside vintage and repurposed pieces of furniture, in what Subu describes as \"blending old-world charm with the modern\". A circular skylight illuminates the living spaces belowOther homes recently completed in Kerala include a mud-plastered dwelling nestled into a forest by Studio Terratects and a residence by 3dor Concepts featuring an oversized concrete roof to offer shade and privacy.
