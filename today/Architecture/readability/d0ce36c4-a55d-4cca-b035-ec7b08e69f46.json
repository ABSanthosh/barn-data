  "text": "Ellen DeGeneres has officially left American life behind and is completely slashing her US real estate portfolio in the process. After relocating to the UK with her wife Portia de Rossi last year, the pair put their final California property on the market for $5 million, per Realtor.DeGeneres and de Rossi purchased the two-bedroom, two-bathroom SoCal home in 2020 for $2.9 million. The dwelling is located in Montecito, a celeb-beloved enclave about five miles from Santa Barbara. The 1,691-square-foot pad was originally built in 1954 as a classic cottage before renovations refashioned it into the contemporary beachside bungalow it is today. The home sits a short distance away from the ocean and, according to the official listing, welcomes in a generous amount of natural light. The property comes with its fair share of “simple yet sophisticated” touches; it boasts a kitchen fully decked out with luxury appliances, plus a primary suite with a private patio, an ensuite bathroom, and a spacious closet. Other luxe features of the residence include sun-drenched patios, a sprawling backyard, a courtyard with a fire pit, a guesthouse, and a pool.DeGeneres sold another Montecito property—a five-bedroom, 10-bathroom compound—in February of last year for $32 million. Unlike her just-listed waterfront abode, that single-floor, Roman-style mansion features extravagant French doors, cathedral ceilings, a chardonnay vineyard, and a full-size tennis court. Among the other well-appointed abodes clipped from the serial house flipper’s portfolio is a midcentury modern Beverly Hills mansion sold in 2022 for $8.8 million.Join NowFlash Sale: Become an AD PRO member today and unlock your design potential.ArrowThe couple are now living in a farmhouse in Cotswolds, a quiet countryside region nearly two hours away from London.",
