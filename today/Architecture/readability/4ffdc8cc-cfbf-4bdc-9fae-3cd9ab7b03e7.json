However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Whether you’re planning a beachside weekend or booking a food tour of the south, any of the best Charleston Airbnbs in South Carolina will greet you with the region’s signature Southern hospitality. The Lowcountry city is one of the most popular destinations in the southeast, and its vacation rental scene comprises a wide swath of housing, from sprawling waterfront abodes to impressive, multi-story homes dating back to the 1800s (like the Whilden House).If you’re new to the city, it’s worth strolling its neighborhoods to study up on all the history within your line of sights: a single cobblestone street can include a hodgepodge of different architectural styles, including Georgian, Art Deco, Italianate, Victorian, Federal, Classic Revival, and Gothic Revival. Rainbow Row—a block of colorful, historic homes in the downtown neighborhood—may be at the top of your itinerary, but don’t underestimate the impact of a mosey down Charleston’s less-touristy streets.Architecture aside, the cuisine (from hush puppies to delicious seafood and soul food), spooky ghost tours, and beach proximity make Charleston, South Carolina the place to be in spring and summer. Ahead, some of the most beloved and beautiful Charleston Airbnbs we uncovered for your next getaway—from pet-friendly villas and condos in the heart of downtown to tucked-away homes a short drive (or bike ride) away from the ocean.Perks: In-unit washer and dryer, outdoor dining space, smart TV, cribWhat resembles a Barbie Dreamhouse on the outside is just as dreamy on the inside. This spacious five-bedroom rental a stone's throw away from King Street (on the main artery of the city’s historic district) features a green-and-pink palette befitting of the Wicked set and can sleep up to 14 of your nearest and dearest. Perks include a soaking tub that will ease your sore muscles after a day of exploring the city on foot, plus an abundance of space to sprawl out. Outdoors, make sure your crew reconvenes for a backyard BBQ if you’re stopping by in peak summer.Price: From $415 per night.Perks: Fireplace, dedicated workspace, coffeemaker, bikesIf you plan on spending most of your time shopping, loading up on fried food, and touring the city’s most beloved spots, you’ll be pleased about the prime location of this three-bedroom manor within walking distance of the city’s buzziest hubs, including King St. The typically Southern wraparound porch is anoter major highlight for people watching, dining, or imbibing alfresco. Inside, the Victorian-era home (which was built in 1885) brims with charm, thanks to individual color palettes that delineate its rooms, from the moodier bunk bed quarters to the powdery pastels of the living room.Price: From $199 per night.Perks: Historic design, full kitchen, free parking, patioStaying here is like walking into a time capsule of sorts—one with plenty of modern amenities like lightning-speed Wi-Fi. Dating back to 1887, the two-bedroom Whilden House features soaring ceilings, original design details such as crown molding and stained glass, along with a massive southern wraparound porch and canopy beds that grace the sleeping spaces. If you plan on enjoying the local culinary delights, consider that at the Whilden, you’re within strolling distance of some great eats (Leon’s Fine Poultry and Oyster Shop, Rodney Scott’s BBQ, and Maison, to name a few).Price: From $311 per night.Perks: Free parking, Smart TV, in-unit washer and dryer, private backyardIf you plan on cooking big, family-style meals, this two-bedroom might just check all of your boxes. Designed in the late 1800s as a “kitchen house”—a style that creates a seamless transition between cooking and lounging spaces—it’s easy to keep conversations going as dinner prep progresses. The back porch is another quintessentially Southern spot for nibbling your dessert, which you can chase with a nightcap or some reruns on the smart TVs in each bed room.From $236 per night.Perks: Bikes, high-speed WiFi, coffeemaker, in-unit washer and dryerSoho House for city dwellers signifies exclusivity and co-working, but in Charleston, it means the exact opposite: enough room for up to 10 of your favorite people and cozy lodgings for everything but logging on to work. Energizing murals, paint, and wallpaper in each room make this spot feel more special than your average bed and breakfast, and this cleverly designed home even includes two bikes for biking to the beach or to the store for supplies.From $249 per night.Perks: Private pool, chef-style kitchen, outdoor dining space, fire pitA mere 20-minute drive from Charleston, Folly Beach has a pier that juts 1,000 feet into the ocean. It’s a classic beach town, with sandy shores strewn with sunbathers, surf shops, and plenty of souvenir opportunities. The four-bedroom home includes its own private pool and a living room that was made for movie nights. The kitchen is worthy of any chef, with state-of-the-art appliances and every piece of cookware you’d need for a delectable family meal. Guests can walk off their breakfasts with a brisk six-minute walk to the beach, or drive into Charleston when a change of scenery is in order.From $1,081 per night.Perks: Smart TV, fireplace, pets allowed, multiple patiosThe Barbuda feels more like a small boutique hotel than a vacation rental, with its picture-perfect bedrooms and lodgings complete with charming floral wallpaper and dramatic furnishings (think artful four poster beds, gilded tables, and and a pink velvet sectional you’ll dream about once you’ve returned home). Originally built in the 1880s, the four-bedroom property offers spacious rooms drenched in light—equipped with king and queen beds, massive walk-in showers, and ceiling fans for air circulation on the swampiest days of the year. Best of all, the home is a quick walk from downtown sights, so you can rest up closeby before another day of taking in the local sights.From $372 per night.Perks: Private pool and hot tub, beach access, chef’s kitchen, ping pong tableLocated on the Isle of Palms—a 23-minute drive from Charleston—this six-bedroom, waterfront home is about so much more than checking the “easy access to beach” box. The main bedroom has a dreamy en-suite bathroom: walk-in shower, garden tub, double sinks, and an unmatched ocean view. End the day with a swim in the pool and a dip in the hot tub or by cooking up a feast in the impressive chef’s kitchen.From $1,500 per night.Perks: Front porch, BBQ grill, WiFi, air conditionerIf the beaches of Isle of Palms and Sullivan’s Island are priorities on your visit, book into this three-bedroom in Mount Pleasant located halfway between the city and the coast’s sandy shores—10-minutes each way via car. Here, guests are greeted by a welcoming front porch, charming rocking chairs, and live oaks. The second floor houses an additional bedroom and a separate lounge space, so it’s the ideal setup for two families vacationing together. You and your guests can grill out or sprawl out on the deck, but most of your meals can be cooked in the chef’s kitchen indoors which flows into the dining and living spaces.From $297 per night.Perks: Beach access, pool, exercise equipment, cribThis one-bedroom luxury condo looks out onto the scenic marshes of Seabrook Island and its brilliant sunsets, with the kind of calming, whitewashed decor to make you feel at home and at peace in your temporary lodgings. Beyond the views, other premium features include a wet bar that’s well-stocked for happy hours, a long kitchen island for prepping meals, and a spa-worthy bathroom setup. The best place to perch come sundown is in the viewing room, the aptly-named living space with wide windows that offer an unencumbered view of your surroundings. When you’re ready for a trip into town, you’re a 38-minute drive to Charleston and two minutes away from Freshfields Village.From $209 per night.Perks: EV charger, Smart TV, central air conditioning, dedicated workspaceMore of a guest house or studio than a full-on home, this nautical James Island stay (complete with rope room dividers and a farmhouse-style color palette) is a smart option for a couple or solo traveler. Past guests applaud its responsive host and quiet environment despite being so close to the crowded streets of Charleston. Fittingly for the decor scheme, it’s also close to Folly Beach for some pier-side fun whenever the mood strikes.From $113 per night.Perks: Backyard, free parking, EV charger, early luggage drop-offThis entire three-bedroom Victorian beauty in downtown Charleston feels like something straight out of an AD spread, from the moody textures and color palettes of its bedrooms to the picturesque kitchen done up in pastels. The lush interiors give the home a restorative, romantic feel (like a modern day Jane Austen novel), and the amenities—from an electric vehicle charger to a washer and dryer—ensure that you have everything you need during your stay. Enjoy the home’s stock of teas for an afternoon pick-me-up, then retreat to the airy living room for some evening relaxation.From $505 per night.Perks: Cowboy pool, hammock, firepit, multi-level deckIn North Charleston, the three-bedroom Marsh Shack makes clever use of its roomy backyard with a small pool, deck chairs for lazing in the sun, an umbrella-covered hammock, chair-lined fire pit, outdoor dining space, and a jumbo-sized Jenga setup. In front, the porch is ideal for stealing away for some quiet time while the rooms themselves are cozy and brightly decorated, including a camplike bunkbed room with a pullout trundle bed. With enough room for you and seven other guests, we’d recommend this playful spot for a group vacation or Bachelorette getaway.From $124 per night.",
