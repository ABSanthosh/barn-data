  "text": "Ellen DeGeneres has officially left American life behind and is completely slashing her US real estate portfolio in the process. After relocating to the UK with her wife Portia de Rossi last year, the pair listed one of their final California properties earlier this month for $5 million. The home officially changed hands for $5.2 million last week after just 10 days on the market, according to Robb Report.DeGeneres and de Rossi purchased the two-bedroom, two-bathroom SoCal home in 2020 for $2.9 million. The dwelling is located in Montecito, a celeb-beloved enclave about five miles from Santa Barbara. The 1,691-square-foot pad was originally built in 1954 as a classic cottage before renovations refashioned it into the contemporary beachside bungalow it is today. The home sits a short distance away from the ocean and, according to the official listing, welcomes in a generous amount of natural light. The property comes with its fair share of “simple yet sophisticated” touches; it boasts a kitchen fully decked out with luxury appliances, plus a primary suite with a private patio, an ensuite bathroom, and a spacious closet. Other luxe features of the residence include sun-drenched patios, a sprawling backyard, a courtyard with a fire pit, a guesthouse, and a pool.DeGeneres flipped another Montecito property—a five-bedroom, 10-bathroom compound—in February of last year to mining magnate Robert Friedland for $32 million. Months later, the former talk show host bought back that estate, known as Pompeiian Court, for the same price as part of a massive real estate deal with Friedland. Unlike her just-listed waterfront abode, the single-floor sprawl features extravagant French doors, cathedral ceilings, a chardonnay vineyard, and a full-size tennis court. Per Robb Report, DeGeneres still owns the Roman-style mansion. According to property records, it was briefly listed for rent in January before going off the market again. DeGeneres and de Rossi also appear to retain ownership of a 1,400-square-foot two-bedroom, two bathroom Santa Barbara property that they bought in September 2021 for $2.95 million.Join NowFlash Sale: Become an AD PRO member today and unlock your design potential.ArrowThe couple are now living in a farmhouse in Cotswolds, a quiet countryside region nearly two hours away from London.",
