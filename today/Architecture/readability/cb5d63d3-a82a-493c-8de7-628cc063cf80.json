  "text": "“This apartment will never really be finished because I’m always thinking of something else I want to change,” Adele Helmers says with a laugh. She and Stephan Raczak are the perfect couple when it comes to renovating and furnishing a historic Berlin apartment. Raczak runs a real estate company that designs and renovates properties. Helmers, who is originally from the United States, studied at the Rhode Island School of Design and has projects in both the US and Berlin. The couple’s apartment was a true diamond in the rough when they found it, and now they have polished it into a unique home. Here, Helmers tells us more about the design and renovation of the couple’s dream apartment.Adele Helmers on renovating her Berlin apartmentAD: Adele, let’s start from the beginning, where did you grow up?Adele Helmers: I grew up in South Carolina with four other siblings in a very old house that my mother had lovingly renovated and decorated. Part of my childhood even included going to antique stores with her and my siblings. We used to call them candy stores back then because the owners would always give us something to snack on. So I grew up around antiques. After school, I started studying textile design at the Rhode Island School of Design.What happened next?After my studies, I moved to Morocco and worked for various non-profit organizations. I then moved to Berlin, where I met my husband relatively quickly—that was around eight years ago.Did you like Berlin right from the start?Berlin has now become my home, I love the city very much. But if I hadn’t met Stephan, I certainly wouldn’t have survived the first winter. We quickly moved in together and started renovating this apartment bit by bit.At what point did you decide to open your own interior design studio?When we started the renovation of our home, I started sharing the process on social media. And we also love entertaining! Suddenly I started getting more and more requests—“Hey, I moved, can you help me too?” and that was the beginning of Adele Helmers Studio.Do you now have a specialty?I mainly work on projects on the East Coast of the US or here in Berlin. I usually renovate old buildings; places that I breathe new life into. For me, it all starts with the architecture and how it shapes the visual and emotional rhythm of a space. I work very intuitively and always try to create a concept that goes deeper than mere surface aesthetics.The interior styles of Americans and Germans are very different. How do you deal with this in your designs?In my designs, I combine both: the cozy, tactile aesthetic of American interiors with the clarity and visual order of German designs so that nothing feels overdone.How Helmer’s changes created a flood of light in a historic Berlin apartmentHow did you work together as a couple during the renovation?I was responsible for the design vision and I planned and designed everything. Stephan approaches every project with a very solution-oriented mindset, he worked with the necessary trades and coordinated the work. After all, he’s already carried out many renovations of old apartments with his real estate company Citium Homes. So I make the decisions and he makes sure that they are implemented. Trust and communication are essential with a project like this.When you take a look at the before pictures, you immediately notice that you changed a lot. Walls have been covered, doors painted… What did the renovation involve?I really wanted to minimize the hallway. For me, it’s a dead space that you can’t use. Natural light is also very, very important to me. I wanted to create a visual axis so that the view sweeps through the entire apartment and daylight can circulate. So we changed parts of the floor plan and reduced the size of the hallway and bathroom, for example, removing or relocating doors and investing in a new floor. We also had the ceilings and stucco work completely restored. The aim was to keep the intrinsic beauty of the apartment.Helmers’s clever color tricksIt all looks very harmonious. How did you use color in the design?It was very important to me to create an atmospheric home, and color was key to that. I opted for a grayish pink for the ceiling in the living room. In the dining room, we had layers of paint removed to create an almost fresco-like effect. We deliberately kept the ceilings darker in most of the rooms as they are so high. I had the walls painted in a white with a yellow undertone (First Light by Little Greene), as Berlin is characterized by a lot of blue-gray light due to its dark winters. I wanted to make sure we had warm natural light all year round.So the weather had a big influence on your color decisions?Definitely, I try to take that into account in every project. But the weather also has a big influence on the room layouts, their orientations, and the textiles I use.The couple had Marco Zanuso’s Lady chair for Arflex, on the left, reupholstered (it was originally red). Art: Duilio Barnabe; Elisabet Oscarsson/© VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn 2025You studied textile design, what impact did that have on the interior design?I always try to create a layered look and play with patterns, shapes, and colors. A good example of this is the bathroom. It was important to me to have carpet there, so it didn’t look too sterile and I hate bathmats. My favorite find is the rug in the living room. I spent a long time looking for a Chinese silk rug and then I came across the right one at a reasonable price at a market. When you spend a long time searching for something, it really makes the object more special when you finally find it. The rug is the perfect contrast to the sofa from the ’60s. I love combining different eras. I also like the fact that each room tells a different story.Did you have any particular source of inspiration?Yes, the Chelsea Hotel in New York City for one. It’s a building steeped in history. Patti Smith and Leonard Cohen are just two of the creatives who have stayed there. It recently reopened after an extensive redesign that preserved the building’s history while adding new sophisticated finishes, evocative color palettes, and a thoughtful restraint. There are also incredible rugs in every room. It’s insane!Have you bought a lot of new furniture?Since I moved from the US and then to Morocco before coming to Berlin, I didn’t arrive with any furniture. This meant I had to create a completely new design vision to tell a story that would allow the individual objects to come together. But I also love changing furniture over time—our bed is from Westwing, for example, and I had it upholstered in a new fabric. We have bought a lot of furniture from auctions and antique dealers like Felix Bachmann.How would you describe your style?Romantic and also eclectic. My style is always evolving; this apartment may not be the same in five years’ time. I don’t think I can ever say that I'm finished. I’m always trying to create the perfect retreat.How do you incorporate art into your interiors?Beyond the visual impact, I see art as a way to add history and a spirit to a space. Whether it’s a small piece of art from a trip I’ve taken or an eye-catching statement piece, art always works on different emotional levels while also creating focal points and a rhythm to the space.What is your favorite work?One of my favorite pieces is a still life by Duilio Barnabè that I bought at an auction. There’s something timeless and emotional about his painting style. It hangs in a spot that gets late afternoon light, and I’m still discovering new aspects to it. That’s the power of good art: It unfolds slowly and anchors a home in beauty and time.Last question: I know you’re expecting a baby soon. How are you preparing yourselves and your home for this?The marble coffee table in the living room has to go; it’s far too dangerous. But I think we’ll have to live with the fact that a white sofa wasn’t a practical decision. I will also have to create storage space for toys. I want them to play and run around. I think furniture is there to be used, you shouldn’t worry too much about wear and tear. Every object has to work with me, not against me. But the apartment will certainly change with a child.Step inside Adele Helmers and Stephan Raczak’s historic Berlin apartmentThe living room has doors or windows on every wall, making it the most difficult room to furnish.
