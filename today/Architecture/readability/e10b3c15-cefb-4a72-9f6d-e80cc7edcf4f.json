This location is one of the most historically significant and heritage-protected streets in the northern suburbs. Homes in this area, including Parkside, typically feature dual street access, with a front entrance on the shaded southern side and a garage facing the sunny northern park. In response to the need for increased housing density within inner-city suburbs, the project involved subdividing the block, retaining the original house, and adding a new structure at the rear to create two distinct family homes. Parkside, however, is more than a mere density solution — it embodies resilience, efficiency, and long-term flexibility, offering improved liveability while respecting the heritage of the area.images © Tess Kellya melbourne home for ‘aging in place’Parkside is an environmentally adaptable two-story home designed by Austin Maynard Architects for aging in place. The compact structure includes single-level living, supplemented by a guest bedroom, bathroom, and art studio on the upper floor, all accessed by a striking yellow spiral staircase. The central courtyard brings natural light, fresh air, and greenery into the open-plan interior. Instead of maintaining a large private garden, the park across the street serves as a shared natural space, offering the residents the benefit of greenery without the burden of upkeep.The owners of Parkside, Bryan and Marija, had purchased their original single-fronted Victorian terrace nearly two decades ago. They saw potential in the dual street access and deep block, envisioning future subdivision. By downsizing into the rear of their property and opening up views of the park previously blocked by a garage, they doubled the block’s density without compromising on heritage or neighborly relations. For the architects, the focus of the design was not on profit maximization but on creating a home that would bring joy and inspiration.Parkside is located in North Fitzroy, Melbourne, and features dual street accessaustin maynard architects maintains community linkStaying engaged with the local community was a central concern for the owners. Research has shown that maintaining strong community ties, especially in vibrant neighborhoods like Fitzroy, can have a positive impact on cognitive abilities, mood, and overall quality of life for older adults. Bryan and Marija’s decision to downsize within their own backyard allowed them to remain in their familiar community, enjoying the sights and sounds of the park opposite, while continuing to live an active, socially connected lifestyle.Bryan Mackenzie, founder of Enzie spiral staircases, and his wife Marija, an artist, had long been familiar with Austin Maynard Architects through past projects involving Enzie staircases. When it came time to design their own home, they entrusted the firm with the project. The design brief emphasized sustainability, functionality, and making the most of the park views. The home needed to include two bedrooms, a studio for Marija’s art, and ample space for entertaining. Maximizing light, air flow, and storage solutions were prioritized over sheer square footage, and custom design elements were incorporated to meet their specific needs.the house is a compact, sustainable two-story home designed for aging in placeOne of the standout features of Parkside is its vibrant yellow spiral staircase. The stair not only serves as a functional element but also as an architectural statement, bringing light and openness to the home’s interior. Though Parkside was designed to allow for single-level living, Bryan explains that the staircase ‘keeps us fit and inspires us.’ Spiral staircases are often seen as safer than traditional ones, as they offer continuous handrail support, making them easier to climb.A significant part of Parkside’s design involved optimizing natural light and ventilation. The central courtyard aligns with a neighboring light well, allowing sunlight and greenery to be shared between the two properties. This internal courtyard, combined with operable panels, strategically placed skylights, and louvres, enables the owners to control light, privacy, and airflow throughout the home. The two-storey void in the dining area features a skylight fitted with rotating louvres, while the perforated steel construction of the spiral staircase filters light without obstruction.a central courtyard brings sunlight and fresh air into the open-plan living spaceSustainability was a core principle in the design of Parkside. The house is fully electric and oriented to take advantage of northern and eastern sunlight, helping to warm the concrete floor, which acts as thermal mass during the cooler months. Energy-efficient elements include double glazing, external shading, ceiling fans, and cross-ventilation systems. Additionally, a 3,000-liter water tank collects rainwater for garden irrigation and toilet flushing. The home’s insulation, low-VOC materials, and permeable garden surfaces contribute further to its environmentally conscious design.the home subdivides the original block, creating two separate family residences",
