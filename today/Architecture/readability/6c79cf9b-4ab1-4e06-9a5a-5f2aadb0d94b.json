This year’s Vision Awards jury assembles eight world-class image-makers — photographers, filmmakers and media producers — who translate buildings into compelling visual stories. From Vancouver to Hong Kong, Bogotá to Brooklyn, they frame space, light and context so vividly that even unbuilt ideas feel tangible. Start Vision Awards Entry Their collective mission aligns perfectly with the Vision Awards’ focus on representation: to reveal architecture’s intangible qualities, inspire public imagination, and elevate the discipline’s dialogue. By judging entries across photography, film, and mixed-media categories, these jurors will champion work that demonstrates how a single image (or sequence) can shape our understanding, preservation, and design of the built environment. Ema Peter Founder of Ema Peter Photography Based in Vancouver, Ema Peter Photography was founded in 2005 to bring Ema’s creative vision to architectural photography. Ema’s training in both the visual arts and photojournalism, with experience at the Magnum Photo Agency in Paris, created the foundations for her approach to lighting and composition. With over 20+ years of experience and shear determination, she has photographed internationally renowned projects and received countless awards. Ema deeply believes that a space has life and she makes it her mission to harness that character in every photograph. Darren Bradley Architectural Photographer at DARREN BRADLEY PHOTOGRAPHY Darren is an American architectural photographer with a passion for mid-century modern architecture and design. Born in 1972 in Honolulu, HI, Darren took his first pictures for a photography class while a freshman in high school. He was instantly hooked. He took his camera everywhere, turned his parents’ laundry into his darkroom, became the school newspaper photographer, and worked at a darkroom in college — but his obsession eventually faded, and when he moved to France to finish his schooling in 1995, he didn’t even bring a camera with him. Upon returning to the US in 1998, he and his wife rented a mid-century modern house in Palm Springs, CA, and he was smitten. He began researching, exploring and appreciating modernist architecture more and more. This new awareness also rekindled his love of photography as he sought to document the buildings he was discovering. Things started taking off from there… Darren’s work has now appeared in large-format art books, academic and professional architecture journals, and lifestyle magazines around the world. He regularly accepts commissions from architects, builders, developers and homeowners. Based in San Diego, CA, Darren is an avid and active supporter of historical preservation efforts, volunteering for organizations including the San Diego Architectural Foundation, La Jolla Historical Society, Docomomo, and Palm Springs Modernism Week. Darren speaks French with native fluency, and holds a degree in history from the University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne. Follow him on Instagram, @modarchitecture Vivien Liu Founder of StudioUNIT Vivien received her Masters of Architecture at Harvard University’s Graduate School of Design, where she was awarded the prestigious Clifford Wong Prize in Housing Design. After 15 years in architecture, Vivien discovered a passion in photographing the urban density and built environment of Hong Kong and around the world. She was accoladed due to her trained architectural eye that translates space into captivating visuals, gaining her a massive organic following on social media as well as the title of Best Female Photographer by #legend in 2017. In her early days, her work has consistently appeared on 10-Best features from popular publications such as ArchDaily, HK Tatler, TimeOut and South China Morning Post. Today, she is creating productions for leading architecture firms and developers on world-class, iconic buildings, including one by a Pritzker-winning architectural office.
