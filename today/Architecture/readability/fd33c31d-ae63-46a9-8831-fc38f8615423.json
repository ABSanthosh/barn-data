  "text": "Studio TAN’s Home in Itoshima fuses Agriculture and Living spacesStudio TAN designs a residence for a family of four, located on the Itoshima Peninsula, Japan, integrating agricultural elements into daily living. Positioned on a coastline facing the Genkai Sea and the mountains of Mount Sefuri, the site is surrounded by a quiet residential area and a forested landscape to the south, with ample space allocated for farming and poultry keeping. The design prioritizes a connection between food production, preparation, and consumption, shaping the spatial organization of the home.The site plan optimizes environmental conditions for agricultural activities. Fields are placed on the east side to receive morning sunlight, while fruit trees are positioned on the north side for optimal airflow and afternoon light exposure. The parking area is located along the western access road, ensuring clear sightlines to both the fields and orchard from within the house.all images by Yashiro Photo OfficeKitchen-Centered Home Blends Indoor and Outdoor LivingThe architectural team at Studio TAN centers the interior layout around the kitchen, eliminating the conventional living room in favor of an open plan that extends into a Japanese-style room, a loft library, and an outdoor dining area. The raised tatami space provides an unobstructed visual connection, allowing interaction across different functions. The lofted bookroom overlooks the double-height atrium, creating a secluded yet connected environment. A large dining table extends through an expansive opening, linking indoor and outdoor dining spaces.The roof design facilitates rainwater management, directing runoff toward three key areas: the parking lot to the west, the orchard to the north, and the cultivated fields to the east. Its sloped form also encloses the loft library, creating a distinct ceiling profile in the atrium and pantry that reflects the structure’s response to seasonal weather conditions.
