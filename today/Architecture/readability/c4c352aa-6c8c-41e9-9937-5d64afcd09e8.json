However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.When the historic Wormley Hotel opened its doors in Washington, D.C. in 1871, it became the first Black-owned luxury hotel to operate stateside. As a hub for international business, it welcomed royalty, dignitaries, presidents, and lawmakers, but also opened the doors for other Black entrepreneurs to enter the hospitality space.Today, there’s a wide range of Black-owned hotels around the world to suit travelers’ every whim, whether they’re looking to post up in a stylish boutique accommodation, well-designed luxury resort, or charming bed-and-breakfast. From the Southwestern ranch vibes of Urban Cowboy to the rich textures and colors of Jnane Tamsna in Morocco, here are several remarkable spaces that are owned by members of the African diaspora.Perks: Nightly live music, free breakfast, bowling alley, Frette Italian sheetsUrban Cowboy is a place for adventurous travelers to lay their heads, if the name didn’t tip you off already. Dating back to the 1800s, this property boasts eight Southwestern-influenced suites designed with graphic wallpaper prints stretching across the ceilings, rustic wood paneling along the walls, and supple leather furnishings. Cookie-cutter suites have no place in this reimagined hotel, where each room has a distinct look and feel except one common feature: a clawfoot bathtub. When you’re ready to venture outside of your room, you’ll be treated to nightly live performances by some of Nashville’s rising artists (a fitting perk for any accommodation located in the Music City of the south). End the evening with wood-fired pizzas at Roberta’s, a famed Brooklyn pizzeria that’s set up shop in the backyard. And for a nightcap, guests have not one, but two bar options to quench their thirst for spirits and top shelf drinks. From $290 per night.Perks: Free parking, free breakfast, tennis court, gardenFlanked by towering palm trees, this boutique hotel combines lush, vibrant interior design with a serene nine acre garden. The juxtaposition of bold architecture, bohemian aesthetics, and serene Moroccan landscaping creates an oasis where guests can luxuriate in nature. With 24 guest rooms spread across five houses, the sprawling property is a wonderland of color and texture, between the sumptuous fabrics, warm hues splashed across the walls, and mahogany furnishings that play up the property’s earthy sensibilities. Guests can expect to eat well at the on-site restaurant that offers Mediterranean fare made with fresh ingredients grown in the hotel garden. Kid-friendly calligraphy classes and camelback excursions also make this a well-rounded retreat for first-timers to the region. From $345 per night.Perks: Fitness center, equestrian center, indoor pool, zip lining, pets allowedThe Blue Ridge Mountains are a spectacular backdrop for this countryside resort nestled in Middleburg, Virginia’s wine country. The expansive property, spread over 340 acres, is steeped in equestrian culture and tradition. Here, guests can relish the lush scenery and surrounding vineyards while horseback riding across the resort grounds and trails. Children can even learn to groom and harness the property’s resident miniature horse, Cupcake.The equestrian influence is also reflected in the lodgings themselves, with accents like artwork and decor that follow the same theme, all selected by owner Sheila C. Johnson. For first-time riders, you may need to book a massage at the tranquil spa on site afterwards. Otherwise, enjoy sipping and swilling local wine or dine at Harrimans Grill, the onsite restaurant that serves classic steakhouse dishes made from regional ingredients. From $535 per night.Perks: Complimentary snacks, secluded garden, keyless entry, outdoor gathering spacesThey say there’s no place like home, but this B\u0026B in the heart of Brooklyn comes pretty close. Located in the young, vibrant Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood on a tree-lined block surrounded by brownstones, this hospitality space is a welcome landing pad for visitors who want to stay beyond the confines of Manhattan. A few stops away from attractions like the Brooklyn Museum, it’s a prime place to lay your head after a day of sightseeing. Guests can unwind in one of the four guest rooms, which are decorated with ornate fireplaces and regal bedscapes, plus rounded out by plush robes and custom toiletries. There’s even an outdoor glamping space for gathering on warm summer nights. From $225 per night.Perks: Fitness center, plunge pool, personal chefHusband and wife team Guy and Michelle Jenkins are the masterminds behind this Caribbean resort, which sits on a hilltop with sweeping waterfront views of Barbados’ exceptionally picturesque Platinum Coast. The secluded property spans nearly 13,000 square feet of both inside and outdoor space where guests can post up by the pool, lounge in covered cabanas, or nosh on authentic Caribbean spreads fusing African, West Indian, and European cuisine. The convivial, tropical atmosphere here is great for vacationing with friends, though the property also hosts wellness retreats and events. From $2,600 per night.Perks: Locally-crafted toiletries, Black-owned art, gift shopLegacy and luxury are seamlessly intertwined at this quaint bed-and-breakfast on the historic Millsaps Buie property, an entry on the National Register of Historic Places. Guests can expect a celebration of cultural heritage that comes through via artwork and decorative accents created by Black artists and artisans. Each of the 11 guest rooms is also named after, and inspired by, a remarkable woman who’s made an impact on the owners’ lives, as well as within the community. Homey touches like tufted paisley ottomans dot the rooms, and some spaces are blessed with checkered stained-glass windows that allow a kaleidoscope of natural light to pour in during the day. While the menu changes seasonally, guests can count on home-cooked, country-style breakfasts that include buttermilk drop biscuits, pork sausage, and yellow stone ground cheese grits to start their day. From $169 per night.Perks: Free Wi-Fi, complimentary snacks, outdoor patioWhen you think of Martha’s Vineyard, cozy cottages and twee storefronts may come to mind. This popular inn fits squarely into that vision. Built in 1870, the Victorian home houses 10 guest rooms, each individually designed for comfort with soft lighting, pristine white linens, and textured accents like wicker headboards. Repeat guests are frequent, returning for the inn’s singular coastal charm, with previous clientele including the likes of Spike Lee, Wynton Marsalis, and Bell Hooks. The inn is also centrally located for exploring the rest of the historic island, just a short walk to the beach and other local attractions. From $175 per night.Perks: Free Wi-Fi, digital key, pets allowed, fitness center, rooftop seasonal pool and terraceSouthern hospitality is on full display at this historic downtown Charleston property with a pretty-in-pink facade and equally alluring interiors. The pool area, offset with striped cabana deck chairs, is just waiting to be posted to the grid, while other communal areas like the dining room (with its dark, moody palette) and European-leaning terrace share the same elegant design sensibilities. Rooms are also beautifully curated with dark woods and modern artwork. Elsewhere, the hotel leans into local Southern comforts, permitting you to bring a fresh catch back to the hotel to cook, or roast S’mores in the courtyard. From $240 per night.Perks: Stocked in-room refrigerator, chef-made breakfasts, free movies and complimentary snacks, private car service, luxury linensThis historic mansion turned hotel offers heated limestone floors in all eight suites and nine guest rooms, but the coziness doesn’t end there. Each room is also equipped with a fireplace, and the beds made with 400-thread count Frette sheets for the most luxurious slumber. Guests are encouraged to make themselves at home by taking a book from the inviting library, striking melodic keys on the Baby Grand piano, or brushing up their billiards skills. Another highlight is the resident bistro, Magdalena, which serves sustainable dishes inspired and sourced from the Chesapeake Bay’s rich bounty. From $630 per night.",
