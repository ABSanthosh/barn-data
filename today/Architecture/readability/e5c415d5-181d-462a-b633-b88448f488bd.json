  "text": "AR Design Studio has brought new life to a mid-century home in Winchester, United Kingdom, creating a seamless blend of the original 1970s design with a fresh contemporary extension. Known as The Seventies House, this project involved both restoring the house and garden, which had fallen into neglect, and adding a 1,012-square-foot addition designed to celebrate the lush landscape that surrounds the property. Originally, the home’s garden was a defining feature, developed by the previous owner, a local horticulturalist, and brimming with mature trees and dense shrubs. However, years of neglect had left it overgrown. AR Design Studio was tasked with rejuvenating the garden, trimming back the foliage and reintroducing new plantings, while relocating elements like the home’s original 70s rockery, or rock garden, to make room for the new extension. The architectural intervention on the house itself introduces a striking contrast. While the original structure showcases the vibrant colors and furniture typical of mid-century design, the extension presents a clean, minimalist approach. A long, asymmetric form stretches along the northern side of the house, with an elegant wooden canopy extending to the west. This overhang not only adds architectural interest but also provides shade and protection from the elements. Inside, the extension prioritizes openness and flexibility. The new space features an expansive kitchen, living, and dining area, making it ideal for both everyday family life and hosting larger gatherings. The use of sliding glass walls creates a strong connection between the interior and the garden, flooding the space with natural light and enhancing the sense of openness. The minimalist interior design allows the garden to take center stage. A neutral palette and sleek, clean lines give the space a calming, contemporary feel. White pocket doors allow flexible partitioning between the kitchen and living areas, offering privacy when needed but opening the house up to light during the day. The furnishings pay homage to the home’s original mid-century character, creating a balance between old and new. A light wood is used throughout the kitchen, offering a textured and warm contrast to the large gray tiles on the floor. The tiles extend out to the wraparound patio further enhancing the seamless indoor/outdoor connection. Even in the bathrooms, the mid-century spirit persists, with modern interpretations of the bold colors and design elements that defined the era. Overall, the The Seventies House transformation carefully maintains its mid-century charm while offering a new, spacious environment that draws the beauty of the garden indoors.
