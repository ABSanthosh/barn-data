  "text": "a portrait of a nationIn Arles, France, a decade-spanning journey unfolds across the gallery walls of Palais de l’Archevêché. U.S. Route 1 (After Berenice Abbott), a collaborative exhibition by photographers Anna Fox and Karen Knorr, offers a contemporary retelling of Berenice Abbott’s 1954 expedition along the Eastern Seaboard. First presented as part of the Rencontres d’Arles festival, the project spans nearly a decade of travel and reflection, and tracks the evolving identity of the United States during a politically fractured era.Set against the legacy of Abbott’s extensive photographic archive, Fox and Knorr began their own journey in 2016, starting in Key West and eventually making their way north to Maine. Like Abbott, they documented motels, diners, storefronts, signage, and the everyday lives of Americans, but did so through the lens of post-2016 political unrest, social upheaval, and a rapidly transforming digital landscape. The resulting body of work, made with a mix of iPhones, DSLRs, and a Phase One medium format camera, resists nostalgia. Instead, it focuses on the contradictions and tensions of the present. designboom visited the exhibition in Arles, which is on view between July 7th and October 5th, 2025, and opened along with launch of their book.Karen Knorr and Anna Fox, Balsam Valley, 2023Anna Fox and Karen Knorr look for americaIn contrast to the commercial optimism captured by Abbott in the 1950s, Anna Fox and Karen Knorr’s images linger on the subdued, often uneasy quiet of a slower U.S. Route 1. Once a major artery of American progress, the road today has a less forward-looking spirit. Their photographs trace the undercurrents of contemporary American life: The remnants of local economies, the signage of political allegiance, and the architecture of disenfranchisement. ‘They searched for a sense of what is happening today and how that differs from what Abbott and Gadd found,’ writes Dr. Charlene Heath in the exhibition essay for Rencontres D’Arles.This search became particularly charged during the Trump presidency, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fox and Knorr continued their project by gathering images from social media, including documentation of the January 6th Capitol riot. The line between observation and participation, fact and filtered performance, became a subtle undercurrent in the work. What began as a road trip became a drawn-out search for the identity of America.Karen Knorr and Anna Fox, Camden 2023Everyday life exhibited in arles, franceThe exhibition’s attention to roadside architecture and landscape becomes a device for social commentary. Cafés and motels sit alongside gun shops and protest placards, and cheerfully painted exteriors front histories of exclusion or economic decline. Fox and Knorr don’t editorialize overtly, but their framing choices are deliberate, drawing out the dissonance between place and policy. In one image, a sunny Southern storefront is disrupted by a mural of Trump and Elon Musk seated beside Robert Kennedy eating burgers on Trump Force One. This moment was captured through the digital feeds on social media, and speaks to the ways photography has shifted since Abbott’s time. The road is no longer just a site of discovery. It has become a scrolling feedback loop. As Heath notes, the project is informed by contemporary movements such as #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, as well as the rollback of reproductive rights. Though rarely shown directly, these forces haunt the spaces Fox and Knorr depict, hinted at through shuttered shops and bumper stickers. Karen Knorr and Anna Fox, Lobster Shack, Islamorada 2016Though long-established in their own right, Anna Fox and Karen Knorr approach U.S. Route 1 as a unified artistic inquiry. Fox, known for her incisive portraits of British social life, brings a sense of saturated realism and cultural critique. Knorr, whose conceptual images often explore class and gender, contributes a more formal, staged sensibility. Together, they navigate the road’s visual and political terrain without forcing a single narrative.Both artists also share a commitment to supporting women in photography. As co-founders of the research initiative Fast Forward, they continue to advocate for greater equity in the field. This ethos permeates the project. ‘Despite being one of the most advanced economies, USA is still surprisingly conservative,’ Heath observes. The photographs illuminate to this conservatism in ways that are subtle and accumulative.Karen Knorr and Anna Fox, Biscayne, Blvd 2025Karen Knorr and Anna Fox, Fort Pierce 2024",
