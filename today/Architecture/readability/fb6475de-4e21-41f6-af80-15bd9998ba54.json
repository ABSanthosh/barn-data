  "text": "bespoke architects unveils sci-fi residence in portugalSky Base One by Bespoke Architects in Lagoa, Portugal, is a villa that fuses sci-fi influences with Taoist philosophy to create a home in sync with nature. The design is driven by fractal geometry and the golden ratio, balancing form and function in a way that makes the villa feel grounded in its coastal setting and poised for flight at the same time. Elevated social spaces and an infinity pool maximize the relationship of the building with its coastal setting. The house is positioned to offer sea views, with hidden gardens and detailed interiors.Skylights that resemble spacecraft hatches fill the circular room that serves as the core of the villa with light.The dark-toned base contrasts with lighter upper levels, giving a sense of groundedness, while a golden perforated centerpiece and minimalist finishes contribute to the villa’s futuristic aesthetic.all images by João Morgado, courtesy of Bespoke ArchitectsSky Base One is infused with tatoist pRinciples of balanceBeing a cult sci-fi film enthusiast, the client envisioned his home as a variation of the traditional villa. This led Lagoa-based Bespoke Architects to a result that infuses architecture with Taoist principles of balance and unity. Built on a narrow plot in Carvoeiro, the villa’s elevated structure becomes a part of the coastal view.Sky Base One offers a connection to nature through private terraces, hidden garden retreats, and sunlit interiors. By day, the villa is bathed in natural light, while at night, lighting transforms the structure, creating a living environment that shifts from serene to lively.a villa that fuses sci-fi influences with Taoist philosophySky Base One is in sync with naturepositioned to offer sea views, with hidden gardens and detailed interiors",
