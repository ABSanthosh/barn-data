  "text": "The world of architectural visualization is evolving rapidly, driven by new technologies and shifting industry demands. To capture the latest trends, Architizer and Chaos surveyed more than 1,000 design professionals worldwide, uncovering key insights into the challenges and opportunities shaping the field. The results are now available in the free-to-download State of Architectural Visualization 2024-25 Report — a must-read for architects, designers and visualizers looking to stay ahead of the curve. Download the Report The new report underlines the critical role of visualization in all areas of architectural design, influencing everything from client decision-making to project approvals. As the industry strives to embrace new tools and creative approaches, professionals must navigate an increasingly complex landscape of software, workflows and emerging technologies. Full of surprising statistics, expert analysis and comparisons with our previously published white paper on the “Future of Architectural Visualization”, this report provides a roadmap for understanding these changes and preparing for the future. What You’ll Learn in the Full Report By downloading the report, you’ll gain exclusive insights into: The role of AI in visualization – Find out how firms of different sizes are experimenting with AI tools for image generation, photorealistic enhancements, and efficiency gains, and what this means for the industry moving forward. The future of sustainability visualization – Understand how firms are adopting emerging tools for daylighting, energy performance analysis, and operational carbon visualization into their workflows. The enduring power of still visualizations – Learn how photorealistic and conceptual renderings continue to dominate client expectations despite advances in visualization technology. Challenges in rendering workflows – Reveal the biggest pain-points AEC professionals face with visualization, from long rendering times to rising software and hardware costs, and how they are addressing these hurdles. How different-sized firms are driving innovation – Learn which firms, from small to large, are leading the charge in adopting cutting-edge visualization technologies, positioning themselves as key influencers in the industry. Access the Report Why This Report Matters Architectural visualization has always been about much more than simply producing stunning images — it’s about communicating design intent, streamlining workflows, and adapting to new client demands. With the increasing role of AI, real-time rendering and sustainability tools, professionals must stay informed to remain competitive. This report serves as an essential guide for architects, designers, and visualization specialists looking to optimize their processes and embrace the latest advancements.Whether you’re a visualization specialist, architect, or industry leader, the white paper provides essential knowledge to help you make informed decisions about your workflow and technology investments.
