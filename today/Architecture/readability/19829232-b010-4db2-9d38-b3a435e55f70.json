  "text": "“I conceived of the project as a lushly planted and inhabited nave, a cathedral-like structure where nature mingles with its occupants, who come and go, stroll, jump, dive, and swim.” This is how Michael Levy describes the vast house he created in a former quarry with no vegetation, in Uzès, France. It’s a town with a history that inspires him, with its Roman heritage including the famous Pont du Gard, as much as the particular site which the architect viewed as a vast territory to explore.His idea was to create a large continuous first floor, which extends from the garden to the interior of the house, with volumes and curved walls defining spaces through which you can move freely. In this stone structure set in the heart of a garden created from nothing, you move from inside to outside, through the grounds and in the water. The pool is an essential component of the design, as are many other water features. If the inspiration comes from the place, the construction aims to blend into the topography of the site. It evokes both troglodyte habitats and future ruins.In this cave-like home, furniture and artworks exist in an intimate relationship with the landscape, erasing the boundaries between inside and outside. “For me, the real border is more than the windows: it’s the curtains that sway in the wind,” Levy says. This hints at the poetry of this contemporary house, where the building and its vegetation form a whole, creating a tension between a refined, radically geometric expression and the exuberance of nature. It’s an abstract interpretation of vernacular architecture: The retaining walls are made of concrete clad in stone, faithful to the architecture of the Gard region in that they are linked to the terrain, making the villa a distinct object, carefully inserted into its setting.Inside, the same brushed Hainaut blue stone is used for the floors, while the aqueous green walls and white ceilings are paired with arches in polished black Corian. These arches open onto the living room and its slightly rounded wall, which Levy imagines as extending an invitation to walk along it and to touch it. The arches also open up vistas as one strolls the property, like vaulted passages. “Corian marks transitions and circulation. When you go from one view of the garden to the next, from one area of light to another, you pass through these dark vaults. These are spaces that exist between two different universes, like interludes. They are also a way of showing that we’re crossing through these volumes, because the structure of this project is made up of pierced masses and large voids.” Corian is an unusual material with its irregularities that are the result of the thermoforming process. It is glossy and polished but, unlike lacquer, it retains imperfections that give its surface an almost aquatic feel. “Holding the Corian handrail to climb into the rooms is a sensory experience,” Levy says.While the open living spaces use the same materials for floors and walls, the more private rooms have a different feel. For example, there’s a TV lounge that is completely upholstered and bathrooms with iridescent glass mosaics that recall the Roman thermal baths that were once common in the region. Colorful material is used in these more intimate spaces that sometimes don’t have any windows. “When there’s no opening to the outside, it’s like stepping into a crystal that has been cut in two, revealing all of its unsuspected richness,” Levy explains. Here, as he often does, the architect slips historical references into his contemporary design. From Roman ruins to medieval buildings, he never forgets the region’s rich heritage.This villa is Levy’s domus romana, a place where he revisits age-old architecture while giving it a contemporary edge, combined with traditional materials such as hand-gouged blackened oak kitchen panels and matte black ceramic tiles. He does all this while still leaving room for joy and sensuality including through a selection of pieces of furniture and decorative objects from the 1970s. They are simple, elemental forms that complete the architect’s postmodernist reinterpretation. He confesses to seeing the architecture and certain 1970s design pieces as expressing a form of almost insolent insouciance where he feels perfectly at home. He concludes: “I can well imagine dancers performing in the open spaces of this house. It hasn’t happened yet, but it’s always in the back of my mind.” Levy’s home is the sort of place where such a spectacle would feel entirely fitting.This home tour was first published by AD France.
