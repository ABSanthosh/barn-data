  "text": "Located by Green Island Lake in Foshan City, Guangdong, China, the Boundless Residence, designed by c.dd, embodies the philosophy of “Limited yet Boundless.” The design seeks to merge the tranquility of nature with modern living spaces, creating an environment where physical comfort and spiritual rejuvenation coexist. Rather than adhering to the rigid boundaries of traditional homes, c.dd adopted a fluid, open-plan layout that allows for an uninterrupted flow between different spaces. The design eliminates physical barriers, ensuring that each area – from the entrance to the living room, dining room, kitchen, and study – blends seamlessly with the next. This open layout transforms the home from a static space into a dynamic, ever-evolving environment that mirrors the fluidity of life itself. This sense of openness is not only physical but also conceptual. The design reimagines the purpose of each space, encouraging residents to interact with their environment in different ways. Whether watching a movie, reading a book, entertaining guests, or simply enjoying the view of the lake, every corner of the residence adapts to the needs of its occupants, offering endless possibilities for relaxation, creativity, and connection. In doing so, c.dd has created a home that is more than just a place to live – it is a canvas for life’s moments, shaped by the people, activities, and time spent within it. Inspired by nature, the design incorporates curved lines, as reflected in Antoni Gaudí’s quote, “There are no straight lines or sharp corners in nature. The straight line belongs to men, the curved line belongs to God.” In keeping with this philosophy, c.dd incorporated gentle, flowing curves throughout the design, from the rounded ceilings to the soft edges of the furnishings. This approach creates a warm, inviting environment that echoes the organic forms found in nature, softening the overall aesthetic of the home. The curves are complemented by concealed, ambient lighting, which enhances the serene atmosphere of the space. Gentle illumination pours from the curved ceilings, bathing the interiors in soft light that subtly shifts with the time of day, creating a calming visual experience that fosters a sense of peace. The use of natural materials – wood, stone, and fabric – reinforces the connection to the surrounding landscape, blending the interior spaces with the natural environment outside. A carefully selected color palette further enhances the residence’s harmonious ambiance. Muted earth tones dominate the design, while accents of deep blue and bright yellow add vibrancy. This restrained yet colorful approach infuses the space with energy and personality. The project also reflects a deep understanding of human needs. Every detail is thoughtfully designed to create a space that resonates with its inhabitants’ emotional and physical requirements. For example, the primary bedroom features a custom wooden table that serves as both a functional piece and a focal point of artistic expression. The result is a personalized sanctuary that promotes creativity and contemplation. Green Island Lake is renowned for its rich biodiversity and scenic beauty. Surrounded by towering camphor, maple, and banyan trees, and centered around a “heart-shaped island” that serves as a sanctuary for rare herons, the location evokes a sense of peace and rejuvenation. At dawn and dusk, the skies above the lake come alive with the graceful flight of thousands of herons, creating an awe-inspiring natural spectacle often described as a “paradise of birds.” He Xiaoping and Li Xinglin of c.dd To see more projects by c.dd, click here.
