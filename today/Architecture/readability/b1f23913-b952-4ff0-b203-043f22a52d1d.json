History buffs can explore architecture from the 1920s at the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, stroll the Deering Estate house museum, or study up on Miami’s urban and environmental design at the Coral Gables Museum. There’s plenty of nightlife to speak of, too, but if you’re aiming for something more low-key, catch a live performance at the Historic Miracle Theatre, or head over to ArtecHouse Miami to immerse yourself in interactive art.You could even devote a day or so to scouring the food scene, from a Cuban food tour of Little Havana to noshing at trendy spots like the playful, pastel-hued Casadonna or local favorites like the News Cafe, the historic restaurant where Gianni Versace used to venture to pick up his daily newspaper.No matter if you’re traveling solo, with a partner, or with a group, there are countless Miami vacation rentals to set you up for an epic vacation to remember, whether you want to be somewhere along the stately avenues of Coral Gables or right in the heart of bustling downtown Miami. Here, nine of our favorite Miami Airbnbs for doing the most (or the least, if relaxation is key) on your visit.Courtesy of AirbnbIn the heart of South Beach and along the Spanish-influenced Española Way lies the peachy-hued Casa Victoria where you'll be posted during your sunny visit. The color palette continues indoors, where pops of orange and yellow complete the tropical vibe of your suite complete with a king-size bed and twin-size floor mattress (which rolls up if you're flying solo). The windows that wrap around your suite soak in lots of sunlight and views of the picturesque surroundings, but one of the biggest perks of your temporary home are the light-blocking curtains which gently diffuse all that light when you’re sleeping off your hangover from the night before.Courtesy of AirbnbLocated in Miami’s Coral Way neighborhood, this lush, pet-friendly casita is the perfect home base for anyone who wants to check into their own private paradise for a few days. The Casa Nomada offers two tranquil bedrooms outfitted with a king and queen bed, respectively, and there are a fully stocked kitchen and an in-unit washer and dryer for business as usual when you’re on vacation. The outdoor space is the real gem of the property, though: a tropical garden flush with palm trees surrounds the private swimming pool like your own personal Eden. It’s fleshed out with a hanging swing and lounge chairs for napping and working on your tan. There’s also free parking on site, so you can rent a car and take a short drive in to Brickell, downtown Miami, Little Havana, South Beach, and more. From $371/night.Courtesy of AirbnbTechnically, this isn't an Airbnb home but a hotel, although Aloha Fridays recently started letting guests book via the rental site instead of going direct. As the name suggests, your new lodgings are extra spacious, with your own separate living room and two bathrooms to commandeer on your stay. Other creature comforts include a small workspace for taking calls or prepping your face, and a bench in the shower for enjoying a little steam while you suds up. From $103/night.Courtesy of AirbnbCheerful colors infuse this double suite with positive energy, so it’s just the kind of space you want to book for some downtime recovering from a nasty winter or a brutal Q1. Located in a historic hotel building in Miami Beach, there’s a stylish pool you share with other guests on the property as well as a communal outdoor cooking area for cheffing it up alfresco. When it’s time to tuck in, you can retreat to your serene bedroom with two double beds and a dresser for storing clothes. From $146/night.Courtesy of AirbnbAn accent wall of pink-and-burgundy wallpaper dresses up the living room at this Art Deco-style one bedroom in Miami Beach close to Biscayne Bay while comfy, coastal furniture gives you a place to fully uneinf. The vacation rental comes with WiFi, a beautiful fully equipped kitchen with glossy wood cabinets, and a pull-out couch for additional guests. Resort passes are also available, if you want to request pool and beach access (and you know you do). From $227/night.Courtesy of AirbnbIf you’re going in with friends or family, consider the upscale community of Coconut Grove, where you can rent out an entire sprawling home for a luxe extended vacation. Though A-frames are most often associated with the mountains, you'll be taking in the beach from your very own cabin that sleeps as many as eight people. The floor-to-ceiling windows in the main living area let in oodles of light to get your vitamin D levels up even indoors. Outside, take advantage of the heated private pool, outdoor kitchen, and comfy lounge chairs for lounging with abandon. Beyond the home, check out the nearby boutiques, restaurants, and shops in nearby spots like Wynwood, Brickell, the beach, and downtown Miami. Then, when it’s time to pack it up and head home, take comfort in knowing you’re about a 15-minute drive from Miami International Airport so you won’t have to make a mad dash for your flight. From $1,400/night.Courtesy of AirbnbSometimes you need a little plant life to keep you grounded, and thankfully this tropical guesthouse has greenery in spades. The casita style home balances a brightly colored exterior with a peaceful garden, koi pond, and waterfall—perfect for finding quiet with a cup of tea or coffee. Inside, you'll fidn several colorful pieces of wall art and a stacked library inside the bedroom with hundreds of wall mounted books. Try out the complimentary bicycles, beach towels, and beach chairs to really make the most of your beach proximity. From $155/night.Courtesy of AirbnbPlanted in Miami’s Design District, this urban-boho condominium is equipped with all of the amenities you can think of to round out an upscale stay. The interior is a mixture of subdued neutrals like the gray couch, rattan wall art, and creamy accent chairs so you can feel restored after a week in the bright sun. And for indulging in even more relaxation, know that your rental comes with access to the yoga room, fitness center, and pool during your visit. From $271/night.Courtesy of AirbnbThis Wynwood studio feels as artistic as the neighborhood it’s located in. A bright teal couch and multi-hued decor brighten up the cool gray interiors, while quilted tiling in the shower livens up your mornings. Step outside onto the private terrace that features faux grass, graffiti lined columns, and overhead murals for a breath of fresh air and a dose of visual inspiration. From $290/night.",
