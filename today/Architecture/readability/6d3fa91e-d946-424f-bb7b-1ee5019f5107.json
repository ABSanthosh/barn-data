The program explores how the built environment can be reimagined and how new experiences can be introduced to the spaces we inhabit. MA Adaptive Reuse Spring Studio collective installation– Redwood Library, Newport, RI – Prof. Wolfgang Rudorf, Lee BoronsonThe one-year+ Master of Arts (MA) in Adaptive Reuse at RISD offers a post-professional, intensive curriculum focused on the creative reuse and transformation of existing buildings. The program emphasizes adaptive reuse as a sustainable practice, integrating architectural, historical, and cultural values into the design process. Students learn to repurpose old or underutilized structures for new purposes—whether residential, commercial, or cultural—while addressing contemporary needs and preserving the building’s historical significance. MA Adaptive Reuse Spring Studio collective installation– Redwood Library, Newport, RI – Prof. Wolfgang Rudorf, Lee Boronson“To adapt architecture is not necessarily a form of nostalgia about the past nor a desire for an aspirational future, but can be an attitude centered on the appreciation of beauty in the present context. We often ask our students to not be caught in the treasures of the precedent nor in promises of novel futures. But instead in honing the beauty and anticipation for the work at hand. To rescue from disuse and decay. To find inspiration from their own value systems with informed responsibility. To envision the creation of uses, artifacts, materials and spaces with a conscious knowledge of resources. Doing the labor ourselves and in collaboration; to advance, alter, innovate, contest and situate how we can live together in the present.” Eduardo Benamor Duarte, Head of Department, Interior Architecture MA Graduate Adaptive Reuse studio 2017 - instructors Liliane Wong, Markus Berger and Michael GruglThis post-professional MA in Adaptive Reuse is designed for students with a first academic degree in architecture or related discipline with work experience in the field. The 45-credit program provides specialized design education, establishing a clear formal, theoretical, and technological framework for the study of adaptive reuse. It equips graduates to engage in architectural practice within the existing built environment. The curriculum emphasizes strategies that address social and environmental responsibility while deepening the architect’s understanding of reuse as both a process and a product, integrating practical and theoretical perspectives. Rohit Rao Vantaram MA - Remastered Studio 2017“MA in Adaptive Reuse at RISD tackles the question of how to re-imagine the existing built environment with a keen interest in the ecological and social impact of architectural and spatial design. This involves designing towards reconfiguration with utmost attention to the existing fabric, while treating ‘reuse’ as not only a structural and programmatic question, but one that has strong ties to the materials, resources, flows, and communities that are at play in any given environment. Such a practice of reuse necessitates not shying away from formal experimentations, working across scales, incorporating emerging technologies, while maintaining a strong sense of place through hands-on experience and real-life scenarios.” Can Altay, Graduate Programs Director, MA \u0026 MDes in Adaptive Reuse Ceramics in Context Studio 2013Program Highlights: Adaptive Reuse Design: Students explore strategies for creatively transforming existing buildings, using both manual and digital design methods to recommend alterations and renovations. Sustainability \u0026 Environmental Responsibility: The program emphasizes minimizing environmental impact by integrating energy-efficient systems and promoting sustainable design. Historical Preservation \u0026 Innovation: Students balance contemporary design requirements with historical preservation, blending new propositions with existing structures to create functional and aesthetically compelling spaces. Curriculum: Studio Courses focus on real-world adaptive reuse projects, from conceptual designs to detailed architectural plans. Historical Research \u0026 Analysis provides a foundation in the history and theory of adaptive reuse. Building Systems \u0026 Professional Practice explores the integration of modern systems into older buildings and equips students with the knowledge needed to navigate real-world project management. Newport Congressional Church MA Studio collective installation 2013In the Studio: Design studios are at the heart of the Interior Architecture department, with seminars that allow students to hone their design skills and understand relevant technologies. Students employ both digital and manual methods to research and propose design alterations that breathe new life into existing buildings. Studios explore a wide range of approaches, including residential, retail, and theater/production design, as well as issues related to preservation and conservation. Each MA candidate develops a final project that begins with a research phase and culminates in a studio design project in the spring. Eun Song Kim, MA Student Work, Layered World, Carpe Diem Arte e Pesquisa Studio, Palacio Pombal LisbonInspiring Community: Approximately 100 undergraduate and graduate students pursue degrees in the Interior Architecture department, working together in their studios at RISD’s Center for Integrative Technologies. Students come from around the world and collaborate with over 25 full and part-time faculty members who practice both in the US and internationally, lending a global, cosmopolitan feel to the department and fostering valuable collaborations and exchanges. MDes Summer program installation 2014Faculty and Resources: The faculty consists of experienced architects, designers, and preservation specialists who bring both practical and academic expertise to the program. RISD's broader resources, such as its renowned architecture and design libraries, state-of-the-art fabrication labs, and materials libraries, provide invaluable tools for students to experiment and refine their designs. Career Pathways: Interior Architecture alumni pursue creatively fulfilling careers worldwide. Some establish their own practices, while others join larger firms or smaller studios.

Each MA candidate develops a final project that begins with a research phase and culminates in a studio design project in the spring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://archinect.gumlet.io/uploads/0e/0e6dc933700797afefaf924de70a5249.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat\u0026amp;enlarge=true\u0026amp;w=1028\" data-size=\"1028x771\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://archinect.gumlet.io/uploads/0e/0e6dc933700797afefaf924de70a5249.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat\u0026amp;enlarge=true\u0026amp;w=514\" srcset=\"https://archinect.gumlet.io/uploads/0e/0e6dc933700797afefaf924de70a5249.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat\u0026amp;enlarge=true\u0026amp;w=514 1x,https://archinect.gumlet.io/uploads/0e/0e6dc933700797afefaf924de70a5249.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat\u0026amp;enlarge=true\u0026amp;w=514\u0026amp;dpr=2 2x, https://archinect.gumlet.io/uploads/0e/0e6dc933700797afefaf924de70a5249.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat\u0026amp;enlarge=true\u0026amp;w=514\u0026amp;dpr=3 3x\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eEun Song Kim, MA Student Work, Layered World, Carpe Diem Arte e Pesquisa Studio, Palacio Pombal Lisbon\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInspiring Community:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApproximately 100 undergraduate and graduate students pursue degrees in the Interior Architecture department, working together in their studios at RISD’s Center for Integrative Technologies.
