This year, we published important conversations with academic leaders about AI application in education, architecture’s role in climate change, and schools' impact on local communities. Leading Voices at Architecture and Design Schools (L-R): SCI-Arc Program Chairs Kristy Balliet, Marcelyn Gow, Elena Manferdini, David RuyAI, Climate, and Advice for the Next Generation: Watch Our Roundtable with SCI-Arc Program Chairs Archinect hosted an insightful roundtable with four program chairs from SCI-Arc, diving into architecture’s most pressing questions. The discussion tackled AI’s impact on the profession, architecture’s role in climate change, overlooked issues, and advice for the next generation. The conversation offers valuable perspectives on education, practice, and the future of the field. Explore the thought-provoking dialogue in the full article and accompanying video. Brett Steele.

In Florida, One Architecture School Offers a Precedent Architecture schools face exciting challenges as they adapt to AI's rapid evolution. Joseph Choma, Director of Florida Atlantic University’s School of Architecture, shared insights on these questions. FAU recently launched one of the nation’s first architecture programs requiring advanced AI training, preparing students to navigate the future of practice and redefine the architect’s role in a rapidly changing technological landscape. Sharing valuable insight with Archinect were (top row, from left) Peggy Deamer, Elizabeth Christoforetti, Marta Gutman, Catherine Chattergoon, Rychiee Espinosa, Lori Brown, Angela Lufkin, Samantha Agostinelli, (bottom row) Eva Franch i Gilabert, Miray Celikkol, Gabrielle Esperdy, Tanvi Singh, Catherine Moreno, Erin Kasimow, Kriti Malik, and Anne Nixon.Notes on Progress: Sixteen Women Discuss What It Means To Be Female in Architecture School Women in architecture schools are making waves, with female deans now at the helm of prestigious institutions like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Cornell. Despite facing challenges, their leadership is leaving a profound mark on architectural education globally. In a May Archinect piece, writer Jamie Chan explored the progress women have made in architecture over the past few years and the areas where further change is needed. The tides are shifting, signaling an exciting era of influence and transformation for women in the field. Tessa Forde.

Forde emphasizes \"organizing\" as a unifying network of relationships spanning disciplines and scales, with architectural education as a transformative arena. She highlights its potential to enhance outcomes for educators, students, the profession, and the planet. Co-authored with Kirsten Day, Peggy Deamer, Andrea Dietz, Jessica Garcia Fritz, Palmyra Geraki, and Valérie Lechêne, the book serves as a guide to leveraging collective action in education to drive positive change across architecture and beyond. Exploring Studio and Student Work Project shown: ‘Recycle, Food, Learn, Play’ by USC architecture students Honghu Chen, Riffath Sultana Hidayathullah, Samuel Tung, Sarina Vega, Jiaqi Zhang, Boyuan Wu [2024].USC Students Try a ‘Bottom-Up’ Approach To Sustainable Housing Delivery in the School of Architecture’s Adaptive P/Re-Use Studios Earlier this month, Archinect’s latest Studio Pin-Ups spotlighted three innovative studios at USC School of Architecture’s M.AARS postgraduate program. Guided by Julia Sulzer and Sascha Delz, the Adaptive P/Re-use studios tackled Los Angeles’ affordable housing and urban service challenges through creative reuse strategies and non-speculative housing models. The projects underscore the importance of sustainability, resilient design, zoning reform, and inclusive economic systems, offering bold solutions to pressing urban issues.
