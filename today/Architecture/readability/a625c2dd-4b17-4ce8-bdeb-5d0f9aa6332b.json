  "text": "With the recent hurricanes devastating parts of the South and Southeast, TJC Products greatly felt the urge to help the community of Asheville, North Carolina. TJC Products has contacted friends, coworkers, contractors, neighbors, and family to support the community affected by Hurricane Helene. The disaster hits close to home for us as a company, as my daughter-in-law has family in Asheville. While they were fortunate to survive the hurricane, they are now facing a severe water crisis due to the destruction of the local water system. The community urgently needs our help. Through family connections, we contacted Joel Johnson, the director of Habitat for Humanity in Asheville. Joel has confirmed a shipping address that can accommodate trucks and trailers and has safe road access. (Courtesy TJC Worldwide) Infinity-AP, a facade contractor based in Waveland, Mississippi, has volunteered to assist with this relief effort. Rick Bradley from Infinity-AP has committed to loading a 53-foot semi-trailer with supplies for Asheville. They have successfully provided similar support during Hurricane Harvey and are well-prepared for this mission. Infinity-AP is also reaching out to secure additional donations and funds, aiming to fill the trailer by October 18. The trailer can hold up to 26 pallets of supplies. We greatly appreciate your support. Any cash donations via Venmo or supplies dropped off at the Infinity-AP office will significantly impact our relief efforts. Venmo account: @Infinity-AP (please designate funds for Asheville Hurricane Relief). Drop off or delivery of supplies location: Infinity-AP 2112 Nicholson Avenue Waveland, Mississippi 39576 For questions and more information contact George Rosado: Office: 972-473-2074 Cell: 214-906-1745 Email: George@tjcwwllc.com",
