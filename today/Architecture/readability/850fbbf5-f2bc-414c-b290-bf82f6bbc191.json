  "text": "Ignacio Urquiza Arquitectos brings together Mexico and JapanLocated in Mexico City’s Juárez neighborhood, a newly completed project dubbed ‘Ninyas’ has been completed by Ignacio Urquiza Arquitectos and Ana Paula de Alba. The 100-square-meter restaurant is curated as a blend of Japanese and Mexican influences through both its cuisine and design. Specializing in rib eye tacos paired with sake, Ninyas features a minimalist interior with stainless steel and wood accents, reflecting the two distinct cultures that, nevertheless, hold several similarities in customs and cuisines. The open layout and reflective surfaces create an immersive dining experience that captures the vibrant spirit of street food culture, while wooden elements and organic forms infuse a sense of warmth.The project concept stems from a father and son’s passion for hosting guests at their home, where they perfected their signature rib eye tacos. What began as a family tradition eventually evolved into the restaurant, with friends and collaborators helping bring the vision to life.images © Rafael Gamostainless steel panels wrap around ninyas restaurantThe Mexican studio’s intervention takes place on the ground floor of a 1950s building. ‘We analyzed trends in both Mexico City and Tokyo, in both their street life and in the materials found in their kitchens,’ shares the team at Ignacio Urquiza Arquitectos, who worked alongside designer Ana Paula de Alba. ‘Sushi bars and teppanyaki griddles made from stainless steel remind us of Mexican fast food joints, classic eateries, and taco restaurants with high tables and bars.’ Inspiration is also drawn from the warmth of lacquered wood finishes found across Japanese eateries, complemented by the vibrancy and shine of Mexican ceramics.Stainless steel panels cover the restaurant’s perimeter walls and define the kitchen furniture, dining bars, and overall layout. The epoxy-coated floor, a non-slip ocher hue, adds warmth and depth to the space, contrasting with the cool, reflective surfaces. These materials come together to evoke a kitchen-like atmosphere where diners actively participate in a shared eating experience. Every reflection on the stainless steel adds color and vibrancy to the minimalist setting.Ignacio Urquiza Arquitectos completes Ninyas restaurantIn contrast to the stark industrial look, the mezzanine introduces a cozier element, featuring a bar where the walls, floor, and ceiling are entirely clad in wood. The shelving unit, positioned between the kitchen and dining area, functions as a partition while facilitating the passage of crockery, cutlery, and sake bottles. Custom-designed stools, crafted from solid oak with stainless steel footrests, soften the overall aesthetic with circular forms while maintaining functional comfort for diners.A stainless steel bridge connects the mezzanine to the main dining area, further uniting the restaurant’s materials and design elements. Ignacio Urquiza Arquitectos composes the facade of pivoting glass panels, which open up to the sidewalk and integrate Ninyas with its surroundings, and enhancing the communal atmosphere.inspired by the vibrant spirit of street food culturea fusion of culinary traditions from Mexico and Japanthe open layout and reflective surfaces create an immersive dining experiencestainless steel panels cover the restaurant’s perimeter walls and dining surfacesthe mezzanine introduces a cozier element, featuring a bar where the walls, floor, and ceiling are entirely clad in woodcustom-designed stools, crafted from solid oak with stainless steel footreststhese materials come together to evoke a kitchen-like atmosphereindustrial surfaces complemented by warm finishes",
