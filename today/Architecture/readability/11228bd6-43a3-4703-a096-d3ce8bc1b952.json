  "text": "Architecture studio Arquitectonica and interior design studio Yabu Pushelberg have designed a \"fun\" residential skyscraper in Miami's Design District for French chef Jean-Georges. The Jean-Georges Miami Tropic Residences will be 48 storeys tall and contain 329 luxury condominiums, as well as amenities such as a podcast-recording studio, bar and lounge, juice bar, spa and outdoor gathering spaces. Arquitectonica and Yabu Pushelberg have designed a skyscraper for chef Jean-Georges in MiamiThe building will also include a Jean-Georges restaurant and retail space at ground level. Renders show a fin-shaped tower that is wrapped in terraces running around the perimeter of each floor. It sits on a multi-level podium with curved corners that clad in glass and terraces on the opposite side. The design features a podium covered in greeneryPlants are shown wrapped around the podium. The building's design is meant to be \"imaginative and fun\" according to the team, which includes Miami developers Terra and Lion Development Group. Terraces line the perimeter of each level\"Designed to provide a curated suite of holistic experiences, Jean-Georges Miami Tropic Residences unique environment is meant to be imaginative, engaging, reinvigorating, and fun,\" said the team. It will also seek to \"blend the urban tapestry\" of the surrounding Design District neighbourhood, which is known for its various creative projects spanning architecture, installations and the arts. \"Miami Tropic's architecture by Arquitectonica and interior design by Yabu Pushelberg seamlessly blend the urban tapestry of art and culture to form strong connections between the building and the people who live there,\" said the team. Yabu Pushelberg's interior design will incorporate plants, shades of green and wood and stone materials to reflect Miami's tropic climate. Yabu Pushelberg will reflect Miami's tropical climate in its interiors\"Having lived in Miami, we've witnessed the Design District's dynamic transformation firsthand,\" said Yabu Pushelberg co-founder George Yabu. \"We are inspired to contribute to this pedestrian-friendly neighborhood with Miami Tropic where the city's lush, tropical environment blends with its vibrant culture.\" The studio will use shades of greensThe project is also \"sustainably-minded\" and will pursue Florida Green Building Design Silver certification. It is slated for completion in 2o27. Miami has seen several new skyscrapers recently completed and proposed for the city's skyline, including an Aston Martin and Bodas Mian Anger-designed tower shaped like a sail and an \"elegant\" skyscraper by Foster + Partners.
