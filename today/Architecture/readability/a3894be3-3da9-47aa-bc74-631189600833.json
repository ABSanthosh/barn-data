  "text": "A cat climbing frame and a cosy window seat are among the features of this colourful extension, added to Park House in London by local studio Office S\u0026M. Bordering Abney Park in Hackney, the addition replaces a leaky conservatory at the Victorian home with a dining and living space designed for both its owners and their cats to enjoy. Office S\u0026M has extended Park House in HackneyOffice S\u0026M's goal for the project was to improve Park House's internal configuration, while also providing the owner with a space to relax and overlook the surrounding trees in the park. Its main feature is a pair of upholstered window seats in the corners of the space, complete with storage, wall lights, a fold-out table and hidden nooks for their feline friends. It is designed for \"both human and feline residents\"\"The clients, both writers who love to read, wanted a multifunctional space where they could cook, eat, read and find inspiration in their surroundings,\" Office S\u0026M co-founder Catrina Catrina Stewart told Dezeen. \"We created a landscape of soft seating that wraps around the kitchen and dining area, designed to meet the needs of both its human and feline residents,\" she continued. \"These versatile elements allow for a range of activities, enabling both people and cats to experience the park from different perspectives. The design invites discovery, making the most of the ever-changing views, and creating spaces that are both tranquil and inspiring.\" A lilac plinth unites the extension with the Victorian houseThe Park House extension takes the form of a single-storey, wood-framed structure with a curved corner. It is unified with the original home by a lilac-tiled plinth. Its form was dictated by the presence of a Grade II-listed wall bordering Abney Park as well as the roots of the surrounding trees. The Park House extension contains a kitchen, living and dining spaceExternally, the Park House extension is painted green. Combined with the lilac tiles beneath, this creates an earthy finish that blends in with the surrounding landscape. \"The design embraces a palette of natural materials and colours, drawing inspiration from the rich context of Abney Park and the surrounding woodland,\" said Stewart. \"The exterior finishes echo the changing seasons, with earthy greens and deep burgundy tones reflecting the hues of summer and autumn.\" Inside, the extension contains a kitchen, living and dining area, illuminated by a large circular rooflight designed to bring \"a sense of connection to nature\". \"It frames captivating views of the tree canopy above,\" said Stewart. \"The rooflight also fills the space with dappled, ever-changing light, enhancing the atmosphere throughout the day.\" It features a bespoke climbing frame for the client's catsThe pair of window seats offer a naturally-lit space to enjoy reading a book and are heated to keep the owners and their cats cosy while sitting there in the winter months. Alongside one of the benches is a bespoke cat climbing frame that incorporates resting spots, a scratching pole and cork-covered shelves designed for \"safe and slip-free climbing\". Window seats feature in its cornersThe Park House extension is complete with a new bathroom and storage space, hidden behind a folding wall. Its interior was finished with a bold range of colours, including yellow kitchen tiles, pastel-blue kitchen cabinetry and red light fixtures, set against a backdrop of exposed wood framework. Park House is finished with a range of coloursA bold range of colours is frequently used in the work of Office S\u0026M, a London studio founded by Stewart and Hugh McEwen in 2013. Its other recent projects in London include Graphic House, the renovation of a mid-terrace Edwardian home in east London, and Beacon House, an extension clad in the same ceramics used for Tube station tiles on the Hammersmith and City Line.
