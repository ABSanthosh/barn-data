  "text": "anchor Graph by Archinect using data provided by Dodge Construction Network The total number of construction starts was shown to have gone up 3% in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.1 trillion, according to the latest Dodge Construction Network data.  According to the new March index, the number of nonresidential starts grew by 6%, whereas residential starts decreased by 5% and nonbuilding starts increased by 9%. On a year-to-date basis, starts were down 1% from last year. Nonresidential starts were down 9%, residential starts were down 5%, while nonbuilding starts were up by 16% over the same period.  For the 12 months ending March 2025, total construction starts were up 4%. Residential starts were up 2%, nonresidential starts were up 3%, and nonbuilding starts rose 8% over the same period.  Related on Archinect: Dodge Momentum Index sees 7% pullback caused by weaker commercial planning\"Construction activity grew over the month, but sector-specific data continued to show mixed trends,\" Eric Gaus, chief economist at Dodge Construction Network, shared. \"Looking ahead, growing uncertainty around trade policy and the direction of the economy will likely weigh on construction activity. Rising delays in the planning pipeline suggest that developers are already bracing for impact, grappling with higher tariffs, dwindling federal funding, and ongoing labor shortages. We expect headwinds to grow as long as the uncertainty remains.\"The largest nonresidential building project to break ground was a $1 billion biomedical research facility in North Carolina. The largest multifamily start to break ground was a $1 billion Four Seasons Private Residences near Las Vegas. A $3.5 billion offshore wind farm between New York and Connecticut was the largest nonbuilding project in the ledger. The biggest driving factors behind the March figures were a reported 21% rise in commercial starts and a 122% rise in manufacturing starts. We've covered the fluctuations in the DCN index and other indicators this year, amidst the impacts of tariff threats and declining architectural billings across the country.",
