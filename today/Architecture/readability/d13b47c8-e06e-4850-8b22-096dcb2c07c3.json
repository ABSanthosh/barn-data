  "text": "Cebra works with Lego employees on the Danish campusCEBRA Architecture collaborates with the LEGO Group to break ground on a 50,000-square-meter Innovation Campus at the Billund, Denmark, headquarters of the company. Designed with input from employees who used LEGO bricks to model ideas for their future workspaces, the campus reflects creativity at its core. This hands-on design process aligns with LEGO’s vision for a dynamic, team-centered environment. In addition to workspace innovation, the campus will feature one of the world’s largest LEGO element libraries, fostering imagination and sustainable design. ‘I am thrilled to mark the beginning of the construction of another new campus as we continue to invest in attractive workplaces for our colleagues around the world. Not only is the building design creative at its core – it is also true to our sustainability ambitions, including our commitment to reducing carbon emissions,’ shares Niels B. Christiansen, CEO of LEGO Group. all images courtesy of LEGO Groupthe innovation campus brings together more than 600 designersOver an 18-month consultation period, employees have been working closely with Aarhus-based CEBRA Architecture, using LEGO bricks to capture and refine concepts that would shape an inspiring and eco-conscious workspace.Designed to spark creativity and sustainability, this LEGO campus will house over 1,700 product marketing, development, and design team employees, uniting over 600 LEGO designers under one roof. The facility features six interconnected modules of up to four stories, incorporating play zones, atriums, and green spaces that prioritize daylight to inspire innovation. At the heart of the building will be one of the world’s largest LEGO element libraries, with around 20,000 unique pieces in 70 colors, providing designers with a comprehensive resource for creativity and product development.employees used LEGO bricks to model ideas for their future workspacesthe building aims for LEED Platinum certificationSustainability is integral to the Innovation Campus, with FSC-certified timber used throughout its core and walls to reduce emissions. The building is designed to meet LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum standards, ensuring energy efficiency, biodiversity, and water conservation through the planning of geometry, height, and facade design. Green spaces and maximized natural light further underscore the LEGO Group’s commitment to an eco-friendly and engaging workplace.Set to open in 2027, the Innovation Campus builds on the ongoing investment of the group in its Billund headquarters, where over 5,900 employees work. It joins the LEGO Campus, opened in 2022, and the upcoming Kornmarken Campus, as part of the company’s commitment to a world-class, collaborative workspace for its global team. ‘Innovation Campus will be an inspiring workplace that honours the modular design of LEGO bricks. With colleague input playing a key role in shaping the overall design, the campus will foster creativity, inclusivity, and the free flow of ideas,’ states Julia Goldin, CPMO of the LEGO Group. the new campus will house one of the world’s largest libraries of LEGO elementsemployees have been working closely with CEBRA Architectureuniting over 600 LEGO designers under one roof project info:name: LEGO | @LEGO Innovation Campus architect:  CEBRA | @cebra_architecture location: Billund, Denmark area: 50,000 sqm",
