The official residence and office of the president of the United States, the White House has been the home of every president since John Adams and the site of some of the most important events in American history.Set on 18 acres of land, the White House is made up of the Executive Residence, the East Wing, and the West Wing, with its famous Oval Office. Today, the residence includes six levels with 132 rooms, including 16 family and guest rooms and 35 bathrooms, and is spread over 55,000 square feet. The White House has been home to every president from John Adams to Joe Biden, and it is an enduring symbol of democracy and one of the most recognizable buildings in the world, attracting 500,000 visitors annually.The early history of the White HousePresident George Washington, who lived in presidential residences in New York and Philadelphia, selected the site of the nation’s capital on the Potomac River for an executive mansion with the help of French architect Pierre Charles L’Enfant, who designed the plan of the city. L’Enfant initially proposed an opulent design for the residence, which would have resulted in a building four times the size of what stands today. He was ultimately dismissed by the three-person committee overseeing the development of the District of Columbia, and his palatial design was abandoned. Instead, Washington and his secretary of state, Thomas Jefferson, decided that the design would be chosen through a national competition.Who built the White House?Jefferson announced the competition—which offered a prize of $500 (or a medal of equal value)—and even reportedly submitted a design himself under the initials “A.Z”. In July of 1792, Irish-born architect James Hoban’s submission was selected by Washington, and he was hired to build the White House.The architectural style of the White HouseThe south façade of the White House Photo: OlegAlbinskyHoban proposed a Palladian neoclassical design. According to Robert P. Watson’s George Washington’s Final Battle: The Epic Struggle to Build a Capital City and a Nation, Hoban’s design took inspiration from L’Enfant’s design for Federal Hall in New York City, Leinster House (now the seat of Ireland’s parliament in Dublin), and a structure he had seen in architect James Gibbs’s 1728 title, Book of Architecture.When was the White House built?Construction began in October of 1792 with the laying of the first cornerstone. “I think it’s critical to recognize that the initial construction of the White House, as well as other early-19th-century projects, like the reconstruction after the burning of the White House…[relied] on the labor of enslaved people, and these laborers [worked] alongside European craftsmen, wage laborers, and African Americans that [were] free to do this work,” says Sarah Fling, a historian at the White House Historical Association. The building was constructed between 1792 and 1800 using Aquia sandstone from the Government Island quarry (also a supplier of stone for the exterior of the US Capitol), bricks made in kilns near the site, and lumber from forests in Maryland and Virginia.In 1800, President John Adams and first lady Abigail Adams moved into the still unfinished building on November 1. While it was much smaller than L’Enfant’s proposal, the completed building was still the largest home in the country and would retain that title until after the Civil War. According to the White House Historical Association, the cost of construction was $232,372.Evolution of the White HouseThe White House has undergone many renovations throughout its history, starting with Thomas Jefferson, who, along with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe, added the East and West Colonnades, which now link the East and West Wings with the Executive Residence. The first major renovation of the White House took place during the War of 1812. On August 24, 1814, British troops marched on Washington, DC, and burned the White House, the Capitol, and several other public buildings. Hoban returned to rebuild the residence, and while work was completed in 1817, he continued to work on additions for several more years. In 1824, he added the South Portico for James Monroe, and he constructed the North Portico for Andrew Jackson from 1829 to 1830.The Green Room in 1956 Photo: Smith Collection / Gado / Getty Images“Every president and first lady really leave their mark, whether that means adding new technology, new artwork, or even external changes like a pool or a putting green, but I think in terms of seeing the White House as we know it today, the 1902 renovation by Theodore Roosevelt really brings the White House into the modern era,” notes Fling.President Theodore Roosevelt hired New York architectural firm McKim, Mead \u0026 White to renovate and expand the building. The firm moved the presidential offices to a new building, which would eventually be known as the West Wing. (Roosevelt’s successor, William Howard Taft, would add the Oval Office to the new extension.) Architect Charles McKim repurposed the former offices into more living spaces, stripped away aesthetically disparate elements from previous administrations, and transformed the basement into the ground floor. New reception rooms, a new entry, and a new grand staircase fit with Roosevelt’s intentions for his administration. “You can see through the Roosevelt renovation that he wants the building to reflect the growing influence and power of the presidency at the turn of the 20th century,” says Fling. “The addition of what we know as the West Wing is major. It became one of the most iconic symbols of the presidency. We also see the Roosevelt renovation expand the State Dining Room, which is really important because it shows the growing importance of the US on the world stage in 1902.”President Harry S. Truman testing out the newly installed bowling alleys in the basement at the White House in 1948 Photo: Bettmann / Getty ImagesWhen President Harry S. Truman moved into the White House in 1945, he became concerned about the state of the building. In 1947, a chandelier in the Blue Room almost fell on Bess Truman and her guests from the Daughters of the American Revolution, and in 1948, the leg of Margaret Truman’s piano pierced through the floor of what is now the private dining room. Engineers confirmed that the building was at risk of collapse, and Truman and his family relocated to Blair House, the president’s guesthouse located nearby at 1651 Pennsylvania Ave.The Blue Room in 1952 Photo: Smith Collection / Gado / Getty Images / Courtesy of National ArchivesThe Blue Room decorated for the holidays in 2021 Photo: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds / AFP / Getty ImagesArchitect Lorenzo Winslow oversaw the three-year gut renovation, during which the inside of the White House was demolished and completely rebuilt. “The Truman renovation is the largest reconstruction at the White House because of the sheer amount of demolition and reconstruction that you see inside,” says Fling.First lady Jacqueline Kennedy giving a tour of the White House in 1962 Photo: Bettmann / Getty ImagesFirst lady Jacqueline Kennedy began a restoration of the interior decoration of the White House in 1961, with the goal of making the historic building a “living museum.” Kennedy asked esteemed collector Henry Francis du Pont of the Winterthur Museum to lead the project and hired Parisian decorator Stéphane Boudin of Maison Jansen to assist with the interior design. “Everything in the White House must have a reason for being there,” the first lady told Life magazine in 1961. “It would be sacrilege merely to redecorate it—a word I hate. It must be restored, and that has nothing to do with decoration. That is a question of scholarship.” Kennedy showed off the restoration during a televised tour that aired on CBS in 1962.To ensure that the White House would be protected and preserved in the future, she founded the White House Historical Association in 1961. “We were initially founded by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy in 1961 for the purpose of enhancing understanding, appreciation, and enjoyment of the White House,” says Fling. “The association’s products fund the acquisition of historic furnishings and artwork at the White House. It assists with the preservation of public rooms and furnishings at the house and also helps to further our educational mission.”The White House was designated a museum by Congress in 1961. The Committee for the Preservation of the White House, founded by President Lyndon Johnson, approves any changes to the State Rooms of the White House.The elements of the White HouseThe Executive ResidenceThe Red Room decorated for the holidays during President Obama’s tenure Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty ImagesThe central Executive Residence is home to the president’s living spaces and the State Rooms. The ground floor originally housed service areas, but now includes the Diplomatic Reception Room, the White House Library, the Map Room, the Vermeil Room, and the China Room. The State Floor features some of the White House’s most treasured spaces, including the East Room, the Blue, Red, and Green Rooms, the State Dining Room, and the Family Dining Room.The private residence of the first family is located on the second floor. In addition to the Presidential Bedroom Suite, the second floor includes historic spaces, such as the Queens’ Bedroom, the Treaty Room, the Yellow Oval Room, the Center Hall, and the East and West Sitting Rooms.The White House’s attic was converted into a third floor during the Coolidge administration, and over the years, it has hosted a music room for President Clinton and a bedroom suite for Melania Trump. There is also a solarium, added by Grace Coolidge, with panoramic views of the Mall.The East WingA small East Wing was first added in 1902 as an entrance to the White House. Today’s structure was built in 1942 and sits atop the Presidential Emergency Operations Center. The two-story East Wing houses the office spaces of the first lady and her staff.The West WingThe Oval Office in 2021 Photo: Bill O'Leary / The Washington Post via Getty ImagesThe West Wing’s centerpiece is the Oval Office. Each president adds their own personal style to the workspace, choosing artwork from the White House collection or borrowing from museums. Six desks have been used in the Oval Office, the most famous of which is the Resolute desk. Made of wood from the HMS Resolute, the desk is currently in use by President Biden.First lady Barbara Bush and her dog, Millie, in the White House Diplomatic Reception Room in 1989 Photo: Carol T.

Additional offices for the president’s staff are located in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The vice president has an office in the West Wing, as well as the ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.The GroundsPresident Joe Biden with Vice President Kamala Harris (R) and US representative Maxwell Frost (L), democrat of Florida, in the Rose Garden of the White House in September of 2023 Photo: SAUL LOEB / AFP via Getty ImagesBeautiful landscaping has graced the White House grounds since the administration of Thomas Jefferson. The South Lawn features over three dozen commemorative trees that date back to the 1870s. During the Kennedy administration, Rachel Lambert “Bunny” Mellon redesigned the White House gardens, including the famed Rose Garden outside the West Wing. The East Garden, also redesigned by Mellon, was later named in honor of Jacqueline Kennedy. First lady Michelle Obama added a 1,100-square-foot vegetable garden on the south grounds in 2009.Interesting facts about the White HouseThe White House once had greenhouses.A greenhouse with orchids at the White House, sometime between 1889 and 1906 Photo: Frances Benjamin Johnston / Heritage Art / Heritage Images via Getty ImagesPresident Buchanan added a glass conservatory in 1857, and it was expanded throughout the 19th century. “[Conservatories and greenhouses were] very popular in the 19th century, especially among first ladies,” says Fling. “But when we see this 1902 renovation with Theodore Roosevelt, he demolished the conservatory to make room for what we know as the West Wing. So it’s something that’s really popular in the 19th century, but I think hard to imagine for a modern audience, having a full greenhouse on the White House grounds.”The White House has a swimming pool.President Gerald Ford in the White House’s outdoor pool in 1975 Photo: David Hume Kennerly/ Getty ImagesThe White House swimming pool used by Franklin D. Roosevelt Photo: Bettmann / Getty ImagesThe White House has been home to two swimming pools. “There had been a pool inside the White House added by Franklin Roosevelt that he would use as exercise for his polio, but later, Gerald Ford wanted an outdoor pool,” says Fling. Ford’s pool was built on the South Lawn, and Roosevelt’s indoor pool was covered and turned into a press briefing room.The kitchen can feed a crowd.Princess Diana dancing with John Travolta in the Cross Hall at the White House during an official dinner in 1985 Photo: Pete Souza / The White House via Getty ImagesThe White House kitchen has the capacity to prepare dinner for 140 guests and hors d’oeuvres for over 1,000.Presidents can bowl, shoot hoops, and watch new releases.The residence features a 42-seat movie theater and a tennis and basketball court. The White House bowling alley was given as a gift to President Truman and was later moved to the basement of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.The White House has a secret entrance.An unmarked alley on H Street is actually a secret entry to the White House. The passage leads to the Treasury Department’s annex, where a tunnel connects the building to the East Wing. The tunnel was constructed during World War II, when the first White House bunker was built for President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Mary Todd Lincoln hosted séances in the White House.Spiritualism was popular during the Civil War and even found its way to the White House. Following the death of her son Willie in 1862, first lady Mary Todd Lincoln hosted séances in the Red Room and at a cottage at the Soldier’s Home, which was used as a presidential retreat during several administrations.There have been ghost sightings.Over the years, White House residents and staffers have reported seeing both presidential and civilian ghosts on the premises, including sightings of the spirits of Abraham Lincoln, Dolley Madison, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Thomas Jefferson, and Andrew Jackson. The staff of the Taft administration told tales of a teenage boy ghost known as The Thing.There’s reportedly a bunker under the North Lawn.The Presidential Emergency Operations Center was built beneath the East Wing during World War II as a shelter and communications center for the president during an attack. However, there are rumors of another underground complex that was built beginning in 2010. According to journalist Ronald Kessler, who wrote about the project in his book The Trump White House: Changing the Rules of the Game, the facility is located five stories underground and has its own food and air supply.It’s valued at nearly $400 million.While its historical significance makes the White House a priceless building, in 2017 Zillow appraised the residence for $397.9 million. According to the real estate marketplace, monthly rental payments would be just over $2 million a month. While the first family fortunately isn’t on the hook for a multimillion-dollar-rent payment, they do have to pay for their own expenses, including food, clothing, household items, hairstylists, and dry cleaning.The White House is missing its cornerstone.On October 13, 1792, a cornerstone was laid on the site of the future Executive Mansion; however, its whereabouts are unknown to this day. There were attempts to locate the stone during the Truman administration’s renovation of the White House and later in 1992 during the construction bicentennial celebration.A flock of sheep grazed on the White House lawn during World War I.Sheep took the place of lawnmowers during the First World War when the manpower needed to tend to the grounds was better served elsewhere. The sheep’s wool was also sold to raise money for the Red Cross.Dolley Madison saved one of the country’s most famous paintings from the fire of 1814.The famous portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart Photo: VCG Wilson/Corbis/Getty ImagesIf it wasn’t for first lady Dolley Madison, the portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart might have been lost to the fire set by British soldiers on August 24, 1814. Madison insisted that the portrait be saved. According to the White House Historical Association, there wasn’t enough time to unscrew the painting from the wall, so the frame was broken, and the painting was removed on its stretcher. The painting returned to the White House in 1817, and today it hangs in the East Room.There have been 19 White House weddings.In addition to countless State Dinners and holiday parties, the White House has also celebrated 19 weddings. The first was the wedding of Dolley Madison’s sister, Lucy Payne Washington, to Supreme Court Associate Justice Thomas Todd in 1812; the most recent nuptials were between President Biden’s granddaugher Naomi Biden and Peter Neal in 2022. There have also been four wedding receptions held at the White House, including a celebration following the New York wedding ceremony of President John Tyler and first lady Julia Gardiner Tyler in 1844.An abandoned ship became the Oval Office’s most famous desk.President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton’s cat, Socks, sits behind the Resolute Desk. Photo: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty ImagesThe iconic Resolute Desk was a gift from Queen Victoria to President Rutherford B. Hayes. The piece was constructed from mahogany and white oak taken from the HMS Resolute. The ship had been abandoned during an Arctic expedition but recovered by an American whaler and returned by Congress as a gift to Queen Victoria. The desk, which was made by William Evenden, has been used by nearly every president since Hayes, and was first used in the Oval Office by President Kennedy.Frequently asked questions about the White HouseWhat was the White House originally called?Early maps referred to the White House as the “President’s Palace,” but in 1810, the building was officially named “Executive Mansion” in order to avoid any connection to royalty. The residence has also been called “President’s House,” or “President’s Mansion.” In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt changed the official name to “White House,” a moniker that had been used throughout the 19th century.Has every president been in the White House?While George Washington chose the site and design of the White House, he did not ever live in the residence. John Adams was the first president to live in the White House, moving in on November 1st, 1800. The executive mansion has been the official residence of every subsequent president.What color is the White House?Contrary to a popular myth that the building was painted white to hide scorch marks after the fire in 1814, the residence was first painted white in 1798 to protect the exterior from weather damage.Today, the White House is painted in Duron’s Whisper White. It takes 570 gallons to cover the exterior.Who can visit the White House?President Bill Clinton’s cat Socks and dog Buddy in the Outer Oval Office in 1998.
