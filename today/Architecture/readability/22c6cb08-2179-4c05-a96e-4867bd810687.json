  "text": "Modern Medieval By •October 9, 2024 • Interiors, International Set along a religious pilgrimage route just southwest of Vienna, dotted with well-preserved and historically significant baroque churches and monasteries, Neuhaus Castle is a 13th-century fortification long left in ruins. Seeing its potential as a country residence, a family has spent the better part of the past four decades slowly but surely restoring this 10,500-square-foot installation and bringing it back to its former, if also updated, glory. Helping them move the meticulous and at times arduous process along is Some Place Studio, which recently outfitted the guest quarters, a modest yet cohesively designed suite of rooms with key details nodding to the locale’s rich history but also contemporary convenience. Working with the peculiarities and existing conditions of the structure while also introducing new elements, the Berlin- and Vienna-based practice—headed up by architect, educator, and curator Bika Rebek—enacted a holistic intervention both in terms of a methodical spatial reorientation and the implementation of custom furnishings. The use of locally sourced materials, culturally appropriate color palettes, and decorative motifs implicitly, rather than explicitly, hint at the castle’s past eminence. “Conceptually, the renovation avoided the opulence of baroque and ornate Habsburg styles in favor of a refined, understated look that emphasizes high-quality craftsmanship and materials,” said Rebek. “The arches and ovals, prevalent in the original castle and the surrounding local baroque architecture, are reinterpreted as defining spatial elements in the renovation.”Read more about the renovation on aninteriormag.com.",
