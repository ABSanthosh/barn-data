Now, Ghenoiu is leading a faculty research initiative at SCI-Arc to study why certain structures survived while others didn’t—and what architects and policymakers can do to create more fire-resistant communities. In a conversation with KCRW’s Press Play with Madeleine Brand, Ghenoiu described how he and his wife, architect Scarlett Esion, took extensive precautions, from replacing vegetation with hardscape to reducing flammable materials. Yet, their home still succumbed to the fire, revealing the limitations of individual efforts in the face of extreme climate events. His research team at SCI-Arc is analyzing the role of building materials, urban planning, and wildfire-resistant design in fire-prone areas. He is advocating for policies that support rebuilding with ignition-resistant construction while maintaining community accessibility in the face of rising property values and insurance challenges. Ghenoiu urges homeowners not to rush into selling their properties at a loss, emphasizing that thoughtful rebuilding—both financially and architecturally—will be key to preserving Altadena’s unique character.",
