Designed for a couple and their two children, the 230-square-meter residence unfolds behind a succession of concentric white walls, culminating in a lush, planted void that becomes the visual anchor of the project.The design builds on the idea of the perivolos, the traditional high wall that once enclosed Cypriot homes and their gardens. Here, it’s reinterpreted as a series of white, protective layers that create a sense of privacy and enclosure while still allowing light and air to flow through.all images by Maria Efthymiou / Creative Photo Roomlayered white walls reinterpret the ‘perivolos’ in House EDHistorically, the perivolos was used in Cypriot homes to shield private courtyards from the outside world. In House ED, Nicosia- and Athens-based draftworks* architects brings this idea into the present through a series of layered white walls that gradually lead from the street to the heart of the home. Rather than entering all at once, you pass through a sequence of spaces, catching glimpses of light, shade, and small pockets of planted greenery, before reaching the central garden. This garden, slightly wild and protected, offers the family a private connection to nature, even in the middle of a growing suburb.Visually, the house takes cues from modernist architecture, specifically from Adolf Loos, with its crisp white surfaces and clean geometry. The extended use of the white color plays a key role in how the house works with light. Throughout the day, sunlight bounces across the walls, a quality especially important to the family, who wanted a home where light could be felt as part of their daily rhythm.Beyond its form, the house is designed as a backdrop for everyday moments and for the couple’s collection of art. Every room is arranged around the central garden, so there’s always a visual and spatial connection to it, no matter where you are in the house. draftworks* architects completes House EDthis family home is organized around a wild inner gardendesigned for a couple and their two childrenthe 230-square-meter residence unfolds behind a succession of concentric white walls",
