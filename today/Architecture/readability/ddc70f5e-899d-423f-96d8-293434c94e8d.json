  "text": "Kris Jenner’s iconic Hidden Hills home, which served as the backdrop for many a Keeping Up With the Kardashians episode, has hit the market for $13.5 million. The reality TV star bought the Mediterranean–style house with her now-ex, Caitlyn Jenner, in 2010 for $4 million. Spanning 8,860 square feet, the 1.5-acre property hosts six bedrooms—all ensuite—and a total of eight bathrooms.“I’ve shared so many unforgettable memories in this incredible home with my family, and I’m excited to see it start a new chapter with its next owners,” Kris told the New York Times. Strategic as ever, the “momager” has timed the listing to the debut of The Kardashians season six, which began airing on Hulu last week. The timing is also opportune in terms of the increased demand caused by the recent Los Angeles wildfires.A living area in the home.

They’re extremely well-versed in real estate and understanding investment returns and market projections.”Fans will recognize many areas of the abode’s interior, especially the grand foyer, which features a double staircase and black-and-white checkerboard floors. The airy room was also the site of a KUWTK scene that went viral on Vine wherein the matriarch presented her daughter Kylie Jenner with a piglet. (To which the Kylie Cosmetics founder responded: “Is that a chicken?”) That scene, and many other oft-quoted tidbits, unfolded at the house throughout the show’s 20 seasons. “This home was an integral part of the show. But it isn’t just a house that was on TV. It’s a home where a family lived their lives, with good times, bad times, kids growing up, and all kinds of evolution,” Fridman told the New York Times.The home’s swimming pool.
