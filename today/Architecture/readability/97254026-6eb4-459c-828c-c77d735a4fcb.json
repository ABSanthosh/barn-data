  "text": "Separate Structures for Distinct school FunctionsBernardo Bader Architekten has completed the Elementary School and Hall in Au, Austria, a project characterized by its clarity and thoughtful integration into the surrounding urban fabric. This newly completed addition consists of two distinct buildings, designed to cater to educational and recreational needs and forming respectful relationships with existing structures on the site. The design divides the project into two separate buildings — a three-story compact, timber cube housing the elementary school and a flat, warehouse-like structure for the gymnasium. This separation ensures that each building is tailored to its specific function while maintaining visual and spatial cohesion across the site.images © Gustav Willeitbernardo bader architekten’s Site-Specific DesignPositioned in dialogue with the middle school and fire department already on the campus, Bernardo Bader Architekten’s placement of these two new structures creates a series of well-proportioned open spaces. The architects specifically design these spaces to accommodate both educational and recreational activities, enhancing the usability of the campus as a whole.The site’s topography was skillfully utilized, with the design incorporating level changes to create fluid transitions between spaces. This feature enhances the project’s accessibility and usability, particularly in its connections to the existing buildings. The southern location of the school building ensures its visibility from the nearby federal road, meeting the need for a clear and welcoming public address in a heterogeneous urban environment.the project by Bernardo Bader Architekten is located in Au, AustriaMaterials and Craftsmanship Local to au, austriaWith the new school in Au, Bernardo Bader Architekten emphasizes design informed by functional organization. Inside the elementary school, learning clusters are strategically planned to lend a conducive environment for both individual and group learning. These clusters are complemented by thoughtful spatial design, maximizing natural light and openness. The gymnasium, set to open in the future, will provide additional recreational facilities and complete the campus’s northeastern edge. Its design will speak to the school building and outdoor sports field, further enriching the campus.The material palette reflects the region’s architectural heritage, with the school building featuring a facade clad in larch wood. The interior continues this theme, utilizing timber finishes to create warm and inviting learning spaces.
