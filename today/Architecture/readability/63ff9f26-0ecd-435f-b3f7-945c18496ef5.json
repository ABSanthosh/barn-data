Situated right off of Central Park in Carnegie Hill, the 15th-floor penthouse at 1120 Fifth Avenue offers uninterrupted views of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir and the city skyline further out. The children of Woodward and the late Newman are handling the sale on behalf of Woodward, who resides at their family home in Westport, Connecticut.It’s not hard to see why the 2,500-square-foot residence was Newman and Woodward’s “oasis in New York,” as the legendary couple’s youngest child, Clea Newman Soderlund, told the NYT. The 1925-built pad boasts views of the sunrise and the sunset and sprawling terraces on each side that total an additional 2,300 square feet.The home’s living area. Photo: Evan Joseph StudiosNumerous original details of the home remain intact, including herringbone floors, a wood-burning fireplace, moldings, and built-ins. “It was really kind of their romantic spot,” Newman Soderlund said. “They would spend weeks at a clip there. They would go to the theater or the opera or out to dinner with friends.” Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Tom Cruise, Cher, Harry Belafonte were among the notable names who the Oscar-winning duo entertained at the penthouse.Join NowHoliday Sale: Become an AD PRO member for only $20 $12 per monthArrowA bedroom inside the home.
