The station connects Los Angeles Metro’s C and K rail lines, closing the final gap along the K line, while marking a significant step forward in the city’s effort to reduce car traffic at LAX. The LAX/Metro Transit Center Station was designed by Grimshaw, along with architect of record and landscape architect Gruen Associates and engineering firm Arup. The project is a component of the wider Landside Access Modernization Program, which establishes a full intermodal facility and a new point of arrival into the city. The program also includes the creation of the long-awaited Automated People Mover, which is set to begin service in 2026. Image © Jason O'RearThe station spans more than 1,100 feet from north to south and includes a bus plaza, bus hub, and a customer service center. The connectedness of the various transit options was central to the design of the station. This was achieved by creating a linked, safe, and fluid movement of passengers. Skylights, canopies, and glazed screens establish a lightweight, spacious environment that reinforces intuitive wayfinding. This experience extends to the wide above-grade concourses, which are filled with natural light. At ground level, the bus bays are integrated into a landscaped public plaza that sits between the bus canopy structures. Image © Jason O'RearThe station also adopts passive design strategies, utilizing California’s coastal climate, including shading by canopies, natural daylight through skylights, and natural ventilation. Targeting LEED Gold, the project also features readily maintained PV panels in adjacent landscaping and infrastructure that will support future EV bus charging.Image © Jason O'Rear“The Metro Transit Center Station transcends the typical function of a transit hub, emerging as a significant civic landmark and gateway to the city’s transport network,” said Managing Partner of Grimshaw’s LA studio, Andrew Byrne. “A hub of multi-modal activity, the station also exemplifies the importance of thoughtful infrastructure to accelerate the necessary shift in our cities: fostering economic vitality and equity and improving the quality of life for residents and visitors alike as Los Angeles moves towards a more sustainable and connected future.” Image © Jason O'RearThe station’s public spaces, including the public plaza, mezzanine, and bike hub, were designed to provide moments of respite and comfort. In addition, the structure’s exterior features drought-tolerant native planting, increasing the biodiversity of the space. The LAX/Metro Transit Center Station comes as Los Angeles awaits major events, such as the FIFA World Cup 26, Super Bowl LXI, and the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The station is expected to significantly increase the Metro’s ridership, with an estimated 5,000 daily boardings by 2035, and reduce the number of personal vehicles in the terminal area.",
