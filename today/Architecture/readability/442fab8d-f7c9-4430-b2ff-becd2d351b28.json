Thanks to a diverse jury of experts from around the world and a global voting public, Architizer has long championed firms from all corners of the globe. This year, we spotlight the unique talent of architects who expertly balance global challenges with local needs. In a world where international work and resources are the norm, today’s leading architects stand out by blending global influences with local traditions, materials, and knowledge. The result? Architecture that is both innovative and deeply rooted in its context. Start Your Submission Have you completed a project that captures the essence of its locale while addressing global concerns? If so, the A+Awards is your platform on which to shine. Enter now for a chance to gain worldwide recognition, have your work featured in print and online, and set a new standard for the built environment. Local Expertise, Global Reach: New Categories Announced Reflecting this year’s theme, the 13th A+Awards invites firms to submit a range of timely new categories, emphasizing architecture that balances local innovation with global vision. New and expanded categories include: Architecture +Localism: Architectural excellence is rooted in understanding and respecting the local context. This category celebrates projects that demonstrate a profound connection to their surroundings, designed in response with the cultural and ecological landscape. Whether through vernacular architecture, critical regionalism, or innovative responses to local traditions and materials, these projects embody a strong sense of place. Architecture +Detailing: The beauty of architecture often lies in the details, where the precision of craftsmanship comes to the fore. This category honors projects that excel in the fine art of construction detailing. From the elegant intersection of building elements to carefully crafted architectural ‘moments,’ these projects showcase an exceptional level of precision and creativity. Submit Your Project Throughout the awards season, we’ll delve into the stories behind some remarkable example of highly contextual spaces from last year’s A+Awards, learning how this decade’s architects are harmonizing the global dimensions of practice with on-the-ground local realities. Best Global Firm: For architecture and/or design firms demonstrating excellence across diverse global geographies. Eligible firms should submit at least 3 projects built within the last 10 years.

Best Local Firm: For architecture and/or design firms demonstrating excellence in their local region. Eligible firms should submit at least 3 projects built within the last 10 years. Projects of all typologies, and scales are eligible, as long as they are all designed and constructed with local and regional emphasis.
