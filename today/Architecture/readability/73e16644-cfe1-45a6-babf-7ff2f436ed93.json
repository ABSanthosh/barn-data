  "text": "pao Revitalizes Village Architecture with Modern CenterThe Fabric Plugin Visitor Center by People’s Architecture Office (PAO) is a contemporary and modular transformation of an old village farmhouse into a local landmark for its rural Chinese site. By introducing a prefabricated, slender, and translucent structure against the original facade, the design distinguishes the center from the traditional architecture of the surrounding area. The modular system used in its construction allows for quick installation, customization, and potential replication, ensuring flexibility for different locations and adapting to the unique needs of various sites.images © People’s Architecture Office, Guan Zhong Mangba Arts Festival CommitteeA Modular Approach to RenovationLocated at the entrance of Caijia Po Village in Xi’an, China, the Fabric Plugin Visitor Center is designed by People’s Architecture Office (PAO) as a modular hub for information about the village and the Mangba Arts Festival. The modular design of the building ensures a consistent approach to the renovation of old buildings in rural areas. In Caijia Po, seven modules have been used to create the visitor center, while a smaller site in Liyukou Village only requires three. This scalable and adaptable approach to construction aligns with the goals of revitalizing rural communities with minimal disruption to the environment.The new addition to the village farmhouse is characterized by a lightweight steel frame facade, which is intentionally unobtrusive, allowing the original building to remain unchanged. As an independent structure, the new facade offers flexibility and reversibility, enabling the building to be adapted or removed as necessary. The elevated wooden deck, along with a fabric membrane above, provides sunshade and creates a comfortable outdoor area for visitors, extending the building’s interior space to the exterior. At night, three horizontal light strips illuminate the blue membrane, enhancing the building’s visibility and creating a distinct atmosphere after dark.Fabric Plugin Visitor Center by PAO transforms an old farmhouse into a local landmarkSustainable, Detachable, and Rapidly InstalledDesigned by People’s Architecture Office as a detachable, modular, and easily installed system, the Fabric Plugin Visitor Center preserves the integrity of the original building while introducing new modular functionality. The use of prefabricated modules allows for quick construction and minimal disruption to the local community, aligning with the need for sustainable and efficient architectural solutions in rural areas.The Fabric Plugin Visitor Center was conceived as part of the 5th Mangba Arts Festival in 2023, an initiative founded by Professor Wu Xiaochuan, alongside faculty and students from the Xi’an Academy of Fine Arts, who launched the Guan Zhong Art Cooperative in 2018. The festival, which includes various rural art interventions, invited PAO to contribute both the visitor center and the interactive installation Starburst. The design reflects a commitment to blending architecture with community engagement, providing a platform for local culture and art while contributing to the ongoing revitalization of rural villages in southern Xi’an.a prefabricated translucent structure contrasts with traditional village architecturethe modular design allows for rapid installation, customization, and replication across different sitesthe project provides information about the village and Mangba Arts Festival",
