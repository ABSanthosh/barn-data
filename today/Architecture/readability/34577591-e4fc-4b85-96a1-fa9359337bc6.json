However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Right about now, most of us in the Northeast can relate to what New Yorker Maira Kalman calls “the impossibility of February” and sometimes, whipping out your credit card and passport to book a trip is the easiest way to stare down the next impending weeks of cold and gray.Our New York-based editors know this struggle well, and we take every opportunity we can to ditch the snow for a quick dose of vitamin D. With the Caribbean and Latin America just a short jaunt away from any of the city’s airports, you can park yourself at some of the best hotels in more appealing climes in under six hours door-to-door. You might not be surprised to know that, in search of a design-forward stay, we tend to stay away from all-inclusive resorts and opt for more boutique hotel and beachfront bungalow experiences. Read on to see which of the best hotels in the Caribbean and other nearby warm weather destinations we pull up to for fun in the sun.Eden Rock is one of those fabled destinations, an oasis of bare-foot luxury and boldfaced glamour tucked among the craggy boulders of St. Bart’s central Baie de St. Jean. The design—distinguished by its signature splashes of crimson red—feels personal and polished. Nothing stuffy. Nothing corporate. Is it fancy? Yes. But it’s also freespirited, a throwback to the island’s days of Radziwills and Rockefellers. Rooms vary widely at Eden Rock, with especially coveted idiosyncratic floorplans on the scenic promontory. Our suite was tucked in the neighboring cove, within earshot of the buzzing beach clubs. I loved being able to recline on our private hammock, relaxing to the sybaritic soundtracks of nearby revelers while also keeping a comfortable distance from the rosé-swilling jet setters dancing on tables. The public spaces were refreshed in 2019 by AD100 designer Martin Brudnizki, who deftly threaded the needle to honor the past while putting his stamp on things.St. Barts is not the easiest place to get to—but the beauty is worth the schlep. There are two routes. You can go through San Juan, hopping on a Tradewind plane from there. Or you can go through St. Maarten, transferring to a quick, fifteen-minute flight or hour-long ferry ride. Over the years, I have done all routes. My favorite is via Tradewind. No matter how you slice it, the journey takes the better part of a day, but if you leave New York first thing in the morning you can be on the beach by mid afternoon.We stayed for four nights, which was a sufficient break from reality and also gave us some time to get off site, renting a car to visit my favorite beach in the whole wide world, Plage de Saline. Eden Rocks expects their guests to explore, offering towels and picnic lunches and whatever you might need. That’s part of the beauty of St. Barts—the hotels all coexist as part of one ecosystem, guests at one property dining at restaurants of another, creating a steady churn of new faces and moods. It’s incredible people watching. My boyfriend called it St. Barts Bingo.As far as amenities go… the service is incredible. Somehow the staff seems aware of your every move and need, choreographing turned-down service and house keeping seamlessly. I loved the spa, which is tucked into the promontory. Breakfast was a scene in the best sense—a parade of caftans and croissants. Take me back.The hotel more than met my expectations. Prices are steep, so save it for a special occasion. But once you’re there just suspend financial disbelief and enjoy. —Sam Cochran, global features directorAs far as beach vacations go, I crave simplicity above all else. So when I was hankering an end-of-the-year escape in December, I wanted the ocean as close to my bedside as possible. I’d long followed Rockhouse, which, in its 50 year history, has hosted the likes of Mick Jagger and what seems like every fashion and travel editor I follow on Instagram, and decided there was no time like the present to get myself to Negril.It’s easy to see why the property is such a siren call. All of the hotel’s villas, which were designed by two Frank Lloyd Wright apprentices, make the most of the coastal, cliffside locale with private decks that lead you straight into impossibly blue waters. In under twenty steps from my bed, I could jump into the sea—mission accomplished. This isn’t the white sand and placid bathwater you might be picturing and therefore isn’t for the faint of heart, but strong swimmers with a sense of adventure will appreciate the invigorating plunge. Grab a snorkel and get moving.For vacation swims with a little less adrenaline, the infinity pool at Rockhouse gives the impression of an ocean swim with no danger in sight—and the poolside happy hour offers two-for-one drinks that’ll keep you quite content while you await what might be the most expansive sunset I’ve ever witnessed. The property also provides a free, daily shuttle service to its sister hotel, Skylark, which is situated on the legendary Negril Seven Mile Beach. It’s here that you’ll find the postcard-worthy white sand beach, as well as food from the Negril outpost of Manhattan-based Miss Lily’s.While I wasn’t busy working towards my goal of doing absolutely nothing but sitting by the sea during my five day stay, I got a chance to check out the gorgeous spa nestled in a thicket of trees as well as a tour of the hotel’s greenhouse, where they hydroponically produce greens and herbs used at Miss Lily’s and the two on-site restaurants, Pushcart (casual, live music) and Rockhouse Restaurant (upscale, open all day).As far as luxury hotels go, the rooms are simple but not lacking amenities in any way. For me, the highlights were the private outdoor shower and the four-post, mosquito-netted bed with unparalleled ocean views available as soon as you open your eyes. After a four hour flight and scenic, 90 minute ride from Montego Bay, you’ll feel gloriously far away from home. —Rachel Fletcher, commerce directorPhoto: Sergio Amiti/Getty ImagesStepping through the gates of the Sofitel Legend Santa Clara Cartagena, a 17th century convent-turned 5-star hotel in Cartagena's historic old town, feels like traveling back in time. Here, amid the Spanish colonial style architecture, lush gardens, and intoxicating heat, time just moves more slowly. I visited last January for an impromptu long weekend escape. We were a bit hardcore and booked the red eye version: Friday morning arrival and Monday night departure, but since the direct flight from New York is only five hours, it wasn’t too bad and really maximized our three-night stay. My best friend Aliza, a tour designer at Artisans of Leisure, crafted the perfect itinerary for our group of four with just enough activities. As it turns out, sunshine, ceviche (we liked La Cevicheria, near the hotel), and salsa dancing at Cafe Havana, fueled by bountiful breakfasts in the hotel garden, world class coffee, and coco loco cocktails, were just what we all needed to beat the winter blues.With Sofitel Legend Santa Clara as our home base, we explored the walled city of Cartegena, shopped the local markets (the concierge tipped us off to Ketty Tinoco, for the best linen shirts), and peeped Fernando Botero's plump Gertrudis sculpture, nearby. Service at the hotel was A+, and you can even text your “butler” should you need help with anything–extra water in the room; a lunch recommendation. One day, the hotel helped us organize a day-long private boat tour (plus transportation) to the nearby Rosario islands that should not be missed—spring for a cocktail made by an enterprising man in a canoe, if you see him, regardless of the hour.In between touristing, we built in ample time for relaxation. For me that meant a massage at the hotel spa, and leisurely hours by the pool, soaking up the sun. I think a few of my friends hit the gym. Be sure to bring along a copy of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' Of Love and Demons for poolside reading—the illustrious crypt that inspired this spooky story is located right on the hotel grounds and Marquez’ house is just around the corner. Try to book a tour of both. If you’re looking for a quick and easy way to escape the cold, I would absolutely recommend Cartagena. My friend group has already discussed making it an annual affair. —Hannah Martin, senior design editorI had never been to this part of Mexico so was unfamiliar with the scale of hospitality. Riviera Maya is a recent development encompassing multiple resorts, including not only Etéreo but a St. Regis and an Edition hotel. It can feel a bit dramatic, driving your way through the shrubs and mangrove en route to Etéreo’s arrival, these dramatic buildings dotting the coast. But once you’re there you feel very cocooned in the hotel’s architectural bubble. It’s a stunning sweep, with a dramatic pool looking out to the ocean. And like all Auberge properties, it takes great care to forge connections to local vernacular and culture, through art installations and the use of regional materials and crafts. It’s a design story, for sure, but it also doesn’t hit you over the head too hard.I stayed here for three nights, as part of a weeklong trip to Mexico. But even without additional stops that would have made for a perfect recharge, given how easy it is to get there from New York City. I tend to completely check out at a beach resort, laying on a lounge chair all day, reading books—no phones for once. And Etéreo is perfect for just that. You could venture off property (to other hotels for meals, to ruins or cenotes) but honestly you won’t want to leave. It’s a place to veg out, soak up some sun, and turn off. That’s effectively how my then boyfriend and I spent three days: poolside, sipping margaritas, eating guacamole. There’s also the ocean, where we ventured for lunch at the beach club. But I wouldn’t call this stretch of sand the most extraordinary. For us, the pool was the vibe.From New York City the trip couldn’t be easier: a four-hour or so flight and then a half-hour drive. Customs can be a pain but such is the price of international travel. The food here was also seriously good—which is so often not the case at a beach resort. But we loved the Mexican menu at Itzam as well as the Asian cuisine at Che Che. It was nice to have options, all delicious. After dinner we would sit by a firepit, surrounded by reflecting pools, and gaze at the stars or chat up the former sorority sisters celebrating their 50th birthdays. One night we did a mezcal tasting. Moods were high. The assignment here is clear: unplug. —CochranWhen I arrived at Our Habitas in Tulum, it felt like stepping into a jungle sanctuary. The property is thoughtfully designed with small buildings seamlessly integrated amongst palm trees and lush flora. The hotel’s construction prioritized preserving the natural habitat, so you’ll find vegetation artfully incorporated into floors and ceilings, with the structures built around them.I stayed for two nights and easily could have stayed longer. The hotel offers a variety of daily activities for guests, from sunrise yoga and artisanal markets to a sunset DJ experience. Beyond the curated schedule, you can also enjoy free bike rentals to explore the area, a serene pool overlooking the ocean, and the hotel’s delicious restaurant, Moro. Open from breakfast (which is complimentary) through dinner, Moro serves locally inspired Mexican cuisine made with fresh, locally sourced ingredients.Photo: Shani KravetzPhoto: Shani KravetzGetting to Tulum has become very convenient with the newly opened Tulum airport just a 30-minute drive to town and another 15 minutes to Our Habitas. The flight from NYC is about four and a half hours, making it a perfect getaway for New Yorkers looking to escape the cold without much hassle. —Shani Kravetz, associate visuals editorEntering Hotel Juayúa is like walking into a serene mountain haven. Flowers cascade gracefully from the trellis lining the breezeway that connects the charming lobby to the pool and garden, where picture perfect views of the region’s most iconic volcanoes await.I stayed at the property for two nights, which was the perfect amount of time to enjoy the delightful town and explore the nearby waterfalls. Perched on a hillside, the hotel offers a peaceful retreat while remaining easily accessible to the town center, home to a local gastronomy festival held every weekend.Traveling through El Salvador was a breeze. The roads are in excellent condition, and the country never feels congested. We hired a driver to take us from our first hotel in El Tunco Beach to Juayúa. The two-hour journey cost $70 and was seamless, offering stunning coastal and mountain views along the famous Ruta de Flores. For those arriving from Monseñor Óscar Arnulfo Romero International Airport, the drive is about two and a half hours.My mom and I stayed in a cozy wooden cabin that offered picturesque views of the mountains, volcanoes, and the property’s garden and pool. The 64-square-foot cabin had two full beds, air conditioning, a private bathroom, and a TV. Facing east, our room treated us to spectacular sunrises each morning, while the sunsets painted the landscape in ever-changing hues.Breakfast each morning was a delight, featuring El Salvador’s plato típico—a traditional plate of plantains, refried beans, eggs, cheese, fruit, tomato sauce, and the country’s signature sour cream—served with refreshing tamarind juice.The hotel is a peaceful and quiet getaway, perfect for those who love mountains, stunning views, hiking, waterfalls, and quaint mountain towns. My mom and I spent our days exploring neighboring towns, enjoying charming restaurants, browsing artisanal shops, and relaxing in natural hot springs and waterfalls. —Andrea Lewis, assistant to the global editorial directorWhen I walked into the lobby my first thought was glamorous. Far from the usual Caribbean tropes, the design of the public spaces is a total throwback—a little bit disco, even a little bit Milan—with graphic compositions of richly striated stone and sculptural furnishings. I was not surprised when I later learned that AD100 Hall of Famer (and maximalist maestro) Kelly Wearstler had designed the hotel. These moody public spaces function as a kind of palette cleanser before you arrive at the rest of the hotel, which is bright and airy, just the kind of joyful jolt you expect from a beach resort. Our suite was spacious, facing the ocean, with a great terrace and plunge pool. It was bliss.My boyfriend and I stayed for three nights. This was enough time to experience the hotel’s great array of swimming pools and beach clubs, as well as its multiple restaurants. We especially loved the newly expanded oceanfront Half Shell bar for Mexican food. (Salt, the main restaurant, was also a hit—with its incredible views of the water.) Had we stayed longer we would have also explored some of Anguilla’s beloved restaurants just down the shore, many of them short walks in the soft sand.There are no direct flights from New York to Anguilla (from Miami, yes) but the trip was a breeze. It’s roughly four hours from JFK to St. Maarten, where you then hop on a short boat to Anguilla. The ferry terminal is across from the airport, making the whole experience very seamless. And the Four Seasons team arranges all your transfers, helping with immigration at every step. The boat ride was a pleasure unto itself, with rum punch on board. When we finally arrived at the hotel after a 20-minute cab ride I was loose, in full vacation mode. All in, I would say you’re looking at 6 or so hours between take off and arrival to the lobby.My favorite spot was the adults-only sunset pool, which was very social and, true to its name, very scenic. Nothing puts people at ease quite like magic hour and booze. Everyone was bobbing in the water, sipping drinks served from the floating bar. We made lots of friends, if only for the night—and what a night it was. We happened to be there on Superbowl Sunday, when the hotel transformed the main bar into a viewing party for the big game. (Admittedly, it took me a moment to realize what game or sport people were referring to.) The spa is also a must if bodywork appeals. The treatment rooms face the water so you’ll hear the sounds of the ocean as your masseur kneads your neck.This was an easy, breezy and rejuvenating trip. It’s quintessential Four Season pampering—great service and utmost comfort but nothing too over-the-top, design-wise. It’s great for a romantic weekend away or, as my neighbor on the flight back advised, nine nights with the family. —CochranPhoto: Walter Bibikow/Getty ImagesI had the luck of squeezing in a vacation at the Bitter End Yacht Club the year before the British Virgin Islands were decimated by Hurricane Irma in 2017. The existing structures (like the beautiful bungalow among the trees where I was posted) had to be fully reconstructed before guests could be readmitted, and in 2021, the hotel was back up and running, albeit closer to the ground. Now, the timber-clad lodgings, styled with nautical-inspired details, are outfitted with wraparound porches and outdoor showers. Still, the evergreen appeal of this beautiful resort remains the same as it ever was: impeccable beachside lodgings with picturesque views of the water, tasty sea-to-table eats, and so many watersports (from kiteboard to windsurfing) and boating opportunities at your fingertips.The hotel’s impressive marina hosts all sorts of yachts up to a whopping 200 feet (the kind you can imagine Richard Branson commandeering, who owns the nearby Necker Island), so if you’ve got your sea legs and want to get out on the water, this is the perfect place to do that. Though I didn’t have much of a stomach for sailing myself, relaxing on the shore at least helped me get deep into vacation mode. Painkillers on the beach (the rum drink, of course) at the hotel’s Reef Sampler, constructed out of a salvaged ship’s hull, are another way to set your internal clock to island time.Around the area, it’s worthwhile taking a drive across the island of Tortola to take in the incredible views or make a trip out to the Baths of Virgin Gorda, a series of granite rock formations that have formed a maze of tunnels and grottos to explore. Guests can fly into Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport (formerly known as Beef Island Airport)—a tiny airport located off Tortola Island, then make a 30 minute ferry ride over to Bitter End. The travel day from the East Coast usually takes at least seven hours and two flights, so factor in two extra days for going back and forth. Oh, and be sure to extend your OOO dates anyways, as this spot requires a minimum five-night stay…In other words, don’t threaten us with a good time. —Lori Keong, associate commerce directorPhoto: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe Dreamcatcher—brought to life by real estate entrepreneur Stephan Watts and his partner, interior designer Roy Delgado—is one of those pinch-me vacation spots that radiates bohemian charm and fun, from the low-slung hammocks that span some of the outdoor spaces to the painted blue fountain that greets you when you arrive at the front desk. I had the pleasure of staying there with a few friends, and was taken by just how truly dreamy the whole place was. Each room has its own personality, from squiggly Ettore Sotsass-esque mirrors and striped wallpaper to sexy, ’70s-esque rooms inflected with bright pops of color.And the vegetarian breakfasts, from French toast topped with fruit to freshly squeezed juices, are also worth staying in for. Even the on-site shared kitchen, which was where I made mug after mug of tea when I eventually got sick midway through the trip, was a nice perk. Though we didn't explore the pool or spa, suffice it to say there are many ways to wind down here. Beyond the property, the beach is just a short mosey away, and you’re also about 15 minutes by car from the magical cobblestone streets and colorful boulevards of Old San Juan.Flights from New York to San Juan are about four hours and are usually always very affordable, so there’s no reason not to make the trek out if you’ve never been. As my sister with a six-year old learned the hard way, though, when I tipped her off to this place, it only accommodates adults. So, if you have little ones of your own, you’ll have to save this one for your next grown-up beach escape away from the kids. —Keong",

My friend group has already discussed making it an annual affair. —\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/contributor/hannah-martin\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHannah Martin\u003c/a\u003e, senior design editor\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had never been to this part of Mexico so was unfamiliar with the scale of hospitality. Riviera Maya is a recent development encompassing multiple resorts, including not only Etéreo but a St. Regis and an Edition hotel. It can feel a bit dramatic, driving your way through the shrubs and mangrove en route to Etéreo’s arrival, these dramatic buildings dotting the coast. But once you’re there you feel very cocooned in the hotel’s architectural bubble. It’s a stunning sweep, with a dramatic pool looking out to the ocean. And like all Auberge properties, it takes great care to forge connections to local vernacular and culture, through art installations and the use of regional materials and crafts. It’s a design story, for sure, but it also doesn’t hit you over the head too hard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI stayed here for three nights, as part of a weeklong trip to Mexico. But even without additional stops that would have made for a perfect recharge, given how easy it is to get there from New York City. I tend to completely check out at a beach resort, laying on a lounge chair all day, reading books—no phones for once. And Etéreo is perfect for just that. You could venture off property (to other hotels for meals, to ruins or cenotes) but honestly you won’t want to leave. It’s a place to veg out, soak up some sun, and turn off. That’s effectively how my then boyfriend and I spent three days: poolside, sipping margaritas, eating guacamole. There’s also the ocean, where we ventured for lunch at the beach club. But I wouldn’t call this stretch of sand the most extraordinary. For us, the pool was the vibe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom New York City the trip couldn’t be easier: a four-hour or so flight and then a half-hour drive. Customs can be a pain but such is the price of international travel. The food here was also seriously good—which is so often not the case at a beach resort. But we loved the Mexican menu at Itzam as well as the Asian cuisine at Che Che. It was nice to have options, all delicious. After dinner we would sit by a firepit, surrounded by reflecting pools, and gaze at the stars or chat up the former sorority sisters celebrating their 50th birthdays. One night we did a mezcal tasting. Moods were high. The assignment here is clear: unplug. —\u003cem\u003eCochran\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I arrived at Our Habitas in Tulum, it felt like stepping into a jungle sanctuary. The property is thoughtfully designed with small buildings seamlessly integrated amongst palm trees and lush flora. The hotel’s construction prioritized preserving the natural habitat, so you’ll find vegetation artfully incorporated into floors and ceilings, with the structures built around them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI stayed for two nights and easily could have stayed longer. The hotel offers a variety of daily activities for guests, from sunrise yoga and artisanal markets to a sunset DJ experience. Beyond the curated schedule, you can also enjoy free bike rentals to explore the area, a serene pool overlooking the ocean, and the hotel’s delicious restaurant, Moro. Open from breakfast (which is complimentary) through dinner, Moro serves locally inspired Mexican cuisine made with fresh, locally sourced ingredients.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"GroupCalloutWrapper\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhoto: Shani Kravetz\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhoto: Shani Kravetz\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eGetting to Tulum has become very convenient with the newly opened Tulum airport just a 30-minute drive to town and another 15 minutes to Our Habitas. The flight from NYC is about four and a half hours, making it a perfect getaway for New Yorkers looking to escape the cold without much hassle. —\u003cem\u003eShani Kravetz, associate visuals editor\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEntering Hotel Juayúa is like walking into a serene mountain haven. Flowers cascade gracefully from the trellis lining the breezeway that connects the charming lobby to the pool and garden, where picture perfect views of the region’s most iconic volcanoes await.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI stayed at the property for two nights, which was the perfect amount of time to enjoy the delightful town and explore the nearby waterfalls. Perched on a hillside, the hotel offers a peaceful retreat while remaining easily accessible to the town center, home to a local gastronomy festival held every weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTraveling through El Salvador was a breeze. The roads are in excellent condition, and the country never feels congested. We hired a driver to take us from our first hotel in El Tunco Beach to Juayúa. The two-hour journey cost $70 and was seamless, offering stunning coastal and mountain views along the famous Ruta de Flores. For those arriving from Monseñor Óscar Arnulfo Romero International Airport, the drive is about two and a half hours.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy mom and I stayed in a cozy wooden cabin that offered picturesque views of the mountains, volcanoes, and the property’s garden and pool. The 64-square-foot cabin had two full beds, air conditioning, a private bathroom, and a TV. Facing east, our room treated us to spectacular sunrises each morning, while the sunsets painted the landscape in ever-changing hues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eBreakfast each morning was a delight, featuring El Salvador’s plato típico—a traditional plate of plantains, refried beans, eggs, cheese, fruit, tomato sauce, and the country’s signature sour cream—served with refreshing tamarind juice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe hotel is a peaceful and quiet getaway, perfect for those who love mountains, stunning views, hiking, waterfalls, and quaint mountain towns. My mom and I spent our days exploring neighboring towns, enjoying charming restaurants, browsing artisanal shops, and relaxing in natural hot springs and waterfalls. —\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/contributor/andrea-lewis\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAndrea Lewis\u003c/a\u003e, assistant to the global editorial director\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I walked into the lobby my first thought was \u003cem\u003eglamorous.\u003c/em\u003e Far from the usual Caribbean tropes, the design of the public spaces is a total throwback—a little bit disco, even a little bit Milan—with graphic compositions of richly striated stone and sculptural furnishings. I was not surprised when I later learned that AD100 Hall of Famer (and maximalist maestro) \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/ad100-kelly-wearstler\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKelly Wearstler\u003c/a\u003e had designed the hotel. These moody public spaces function as a kind of palette cleanser before you arrive at the rest of the hotel, which is bright and airy, just the kind of joyful jolt you expect from a beach resort. Our suite was spacious, facing the ocean, with a great terrace and plunge pool. It was bliss.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy boyfriend and I stayed for three nights. This was enough time to experience the hotel’s great array of swimming pools and beach clubs, as well as its multiple restaurants. We especially loved the newly expanded oceanfront Half Shell bar for Mexican food. (Salt, the main restaurant, was also a hit—with its incredible views of the water.) Had we stayed longer we would have also explored some of Anguilla’s beloved restaurants just down the shore, many of them short walks in the soft sand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are no direct flights from New York to Anguilla (from Miami, yes) but the trip was a breeze. It’s roughly four hours from JFK to St. Maarten, where you then hop on a short boat to Anguilla. The ferry terminal is across from the airport, making the whole experience very seamless. And the Four Seasons team arranges all your transfers, helping with immigration at every step. The boat ride was a pleasure unto itself, with rum punch on board. When we finally arrived at the hotel after a 20-minute cab ride I was loose, in full vacation mode. All in, I would say you’re looking at 6 or so hours between take off and arrival to the lobby.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy favorite spot was the adults-only sunset pool, which was very social and, true to its name, very scenic. Nothing puts people at ease quite like magic hour and booze. Everyone was bobbing in the water, sipping drinks served from the floating bar. We made lots of friends, if only for the night—and what a night it was. We happened to be there on Superbowl Sunday, when the hotel transformed the main bar into a viewing party for the big game. (Admittedly, it took me a moment to realize what game or sport people were referring to.) The spa is also a must if bodywork appeals. The treatment rooms face the water so you’ll hear the sounds of the ocean as your masseur kneads your neck.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis was an easy, breezy and rejuvenating trip. It’s quintessential Four Season pampering—great service and utmost comfort but nothing too over-the-top, design-wise. It’s great for a romantic weekend away or, as my neighbor on the flight back advised, nine nights with the family. \u003cem\u003e—Cochran\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhoto: Walter Bibikow/Getty Images\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had the luck of squeezing in a vacation at the Bitter End Yacht Club the year before the British Virgin Islands were decimated by Hurricane Irma in 2017. The existing structures (like the beautiful bungalow among the trees where I was posted) had to be fully reconstructed before guests could be readmitted, and in 2021, the hotel was back up and running, albeit closer to the ground. Now, the timber-clad lodgings, styled with nautical-inspired details, are outfitted with wraparound porches and outdoor showers. Still, the evergreen appeal of this beautiful resort remains the same as it ever was: impeccable beachside lodgings with picturesque views of the water, tasty sea-to-table eats, and so many watersports (from kiteboard to windsurfing) and boating opportunities at your fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe hotel’s impressive marina hosts all sorts of yachts up to a whopping 200 feet (the kind you can imagine Richard Branson commandeering, who owns the nearby Necker Island), so if you’ve got your sea legs and want to get out on the water, this is the perfect place to do that. Though I didn’t have much of a stomach for sailing myself, relaxing on the shore at least helped me get deep into vacation mode. Painkillers on the beach (the rum drink, of course) at the hotel’s Reef Sampler, constructed out of a salvaged ship’s hull, are another way to set your internal clock to island time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAround the area, it’s worthwhile taking a drive across the island of Tortola to take in the incredible views or make a trip out to the Baths of Virgin Gorda, a series of granite rock formations that have formed a maze of tunnels and grottos to explore. Guests can fly into Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport (formerly known as Beef Island Airport)—a tiny airport located off Tortola Island, then make a 30 minute ferry ride over to Bitter End. The travel day from the East Coast usually takes at least seven hours and two flights, so factor in two extra days for going back and forth. Oh, and be sure to extend your OOO dates anyways, as this spot requires a minimum five-night stay…In other words, don’t threaten us with a good time. —\u003cem\u003eLori Keong, associate commerce director\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhoto: Anadolu/Getty Images\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Dreamcatcher—brought to life by real estate entrepreneur Stephan Watts and his partner, interior designer Roy Delgado—is one of those pinch-me vacation spots that radiates bohemian charm and fun, from the low-slung hammocks that span some of the outdoor spaces to the painted blue fountain that greets you when you arrive at the front desk. I had the pleasure of staying there with a few friends, and was taken by just how truly dreamy the whole place was. Each room has its own personality, from squiggly Ettore Sotsass-esque mirrors and striped wallpaper to sexy, ’70s-esque rooms inflected with bright pops of color.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the vegetarian breakfasts, from French toast topped with fruit to freshly squeezed juices, are also worth staying in for. Even the on-site shared kitchen, which was where I made mug after mug of tea when I eventually got sick midway through the trip, was a nice perk. Though we didn\u0026#39;t explore the pool or spa, suffice it to say there are many ways to wind down here. Beyond the property, the beach is just a short mosey away, and you’re also about 15 minutes by car from the magical cobblestone streets and colorful boulevards of Old San Juan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFlights from New York to San Juan are about four hours and are usually always very affordable, so there’s no reason not to make the trek out if you’ve never been. As my sister with a six-year old learned the hard way, though, when I tipped her off to this place, it only accommodates adults. So, if you have little ones of your own, you’ll have to save this one for your next grown-up beach escape away from the kids. —\u003cem\u003eKeong\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
