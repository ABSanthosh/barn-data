It’s refreshing to hear it from ArchDaily founder David Basulto and his spouse Valeriia Karas, in the context of both the city they chose to make their home and their relationship. The Chilean-Ukrainian couple met in 2017 at a Soho House party in Berlin, and, after years of long-distance dating, the couple got married. They moved into an apartment together in the Herzog \u0026 de Meuron Vert building at the Tacheles residential complex in the heart of the city. The rest, as they say, is history.Enthusiasts of both the Japandi style and Soho House’s eclectic club interiors, the couple tapped the Ukrainian architecture studio Balbek Bureau to design their 900-square-foot apartment. The narrow hallway, which leads straight into the heart of the apartment, and the open kitchen-living room with adjoining balcony were laid out in a more-than-restrained manner. To make the original monolithic gray kitchen more visually appealing, Balbek Bureau divided it into three sections, each made of a different material. The cupboards have MDF panel veneers, while other cabinets are clad in stainless steel, and the wall is covered in precious Caribbean quartzite, whose gray-green hue can also be seen at the rear of an upper row of cabinets with a frosted glass front.The couple’s bedroom, which opens out onto a small terrace, lies in the opposite direction down a hallway. Its undulating plywood cladding was inspired by the gentle lines of the Vert building’s façade. The highlight of the room is a backlit, colorful semi-transparent closet—the idea came from Karas, who is a big fan of Dutch designer Sabine Marcelis’s works in glass. Two bathrooms, in pink and green, add other colorful accents while creating private spaces for the couple. In a conversation with AD, they tell us how they fell in love with each other, and with their home in the Vert building.AD Germany interviews David Basulto and Valeriia KarasAD: What drew you to Berlin?David Basulto: When Valeriia and I met, I was still living in Chile. But I came to Berlin all the time, since I just love the creative energy here so much. At some point we realized that we wanted to live here. Eventually we started meeting regularly, got engaged here, and I would fly from Chile once a month.Talk about a long-distance relationship...Valeriia Karas: When we met in Berlin, everything was so uncertain because he was from Chile, I was from Ukraine, and we didn’t know what the future would bring. Since his position was as CEO, I couldn’t just ask him, “Hey, please move to Berlin and leave your company and 60 employees.” So we had a long-distance relationship, but he promised to come every month. For me it was unimaginable that someone would fly halfway around the world every month, but he did.Your frequent flyer days seem to be over for now.Basulto: Yes, we got very lucky because my company was taken over by a Swiss-German group. That gave me the chance to live in Berlin. So I moved here in 2020, which was, of course, in the middle of the pandemic and a pretty strange year. But I think arriving in Berlin at such a slow moment had its advantages too.Ms. Karas, Berlin is your adopted home and you’re originally from Ukraine.Karas: I was born and grew up in Kyiv and later I came to Berlin to study history at the Free University. Upon graduating, I realized, however, that it wasn’t really my thing. I love beauty and style; my mother is a hairdresser, and I’ve spent a lot of money and time in salons. When I met David in Berlin in 2017 that changed everything. He encouraged me to do what really brings me joy. At some point, I decided to go into cosmetics, did the training, and now I work as a beautician. That’s what makes me happy! I finally know exactly what I’m doing.How the couple discovered the Tacheles apartment building before it was even builtHow did you find this unique apartment?Basulto: We had known that the Tacheles complex was going to be renovated, with a museum and residential buildings. So we got in touch with the people in charge and that’s how we found the apartment. We still had to wait a few years for it to be built though. I’ve been saying ever since that this is where I want to live for the rest of my life.Karas: We used to talk about how helpful it would be for each of us to have our own bathroom. When we saw this apartment with its twin bathrooms, we knew immediately this was it.With its curved façade, the Herzog \u0026 de Meuron building is one of the more charismatic in the residential complex at Tacheles.Basulto: Looking in detail at the different buildings, it became clear that each one had its own personality. But ours has a very special identity. The wavy walls are reminiscent of Bauhaus or German modernism, only with slight curves—it could be right out of the 1920s. It has a strong character. But it wasn’t just about the exterior; the interior layout was very important too. The person showing it to us even said, “This one with its two full bathrooms could appeal to you.” And with Valeriia being a beautician, the bathroom is practically an office for her. All the floor plans of the building vary, and you can tell that they had taken into consideration families having different lifestyles. And right away that’s what we found most exciting.How much did you influence the interior design yourself?Basulto: In Chile, the kitchen, cupboards, and some other items, are usually included in the purchase. It’s different in Germany where there are hardly any prefabricated elements that come with a home. So you are pretty free to choose what you want, which explains why many apartments here look quite minimalist to me. We wanted our apartment to be warm and cozy. I’m an architect who sees a lot of things and I like individual pieces of furniture, certain chairs or tables, but I wouldn’t say I have particularly great taste when it comes to pulling all the elements together to create an interior that works.Where did the inspiration for the interior come from?Karas: We would travel to Kyiv a lot. The city’s lifestyle is great with restaurants, cafés, beauty salons, and hotels. We found out that the architects responsible for the design of a hotel that we liked were from a Ukrainian studio called Balbek Bureau.Basulto: At the time, I was publishing a lot of their work on ArchDaily and thought how great it would be to work with this architecture team on our home. I went ahead and asked them if they would be interested in joining the project, though I wasn’t sure how it would work logistically. They immediately agreed though as they do a lot of projects in Europe—Switzerland and Germany—and internationally in Mexico and the US. They can work on site or manufacture items in Ukraine and have them shipped to Germany. I found that really exciting because they’re very good at steelwork and making furniture. And everything is custom.How did the collaboration go?Basulto: The long-distance collaboration went really well as they are very good at visualizing. Meetings were usually conducted quickly. Then having a project team member come over here was also helpful. I found that we had a good connection with them right from the start and after about three iterations we were done. We focused next on details and product sourcing. That was the hardest part, and as an architect I knew that specifications, mostly in the fulfillment and production of the custom furniture, would be the biggest challenge. I learned about the Ukrainian-German company Plan B in an issue of AD. Their office is in Berlin and they were the last piece of the project puzzle.Which design elements are you most pleased with?Karas: The translucent wardrobe. I love the work of Sabine Marcelis whose design approach inspired me. The wardrobe was just what I wanted, and its design exactly what I had imagined. It’s simply wonderful. The color palette was the only thing that was adjusted slightly. At first, we had wanted a bright orange wardrobe, but in the end we went with a soft peach which gives the room a warm, inviting atmosphere. I'm also particularly proud of the table from Sarah Ellison, an Australian brand that I really like. Australia and its extraordinary design scene and natural beauty have fascinated us for years. The thought of actually bringing this furniture here initially seemed almost impossible. But thanks to David’s contacts at Sarah Ellison, the dream became a reality.Basulto: In the end, the table and chairs arrived here from Australia faster than furniture we ordered in Europe. [Laughs.]How art brings a personal touch to their homeThere are small striking artworks all over your home.Karas: I’ve always enjoyed art. Over time, we’ve built up a small collection. When I was a student, I bought a painting that I really loved by an Estonian artist. It still has a special significance for me. The work feels like it fits harmoniously in the space here. We also have a close relationship with a photographer from Chile. She takes pictures of these triangular buildings found all over Chile that are used as summer houses. Her photos add a personal touch to our home and tell stories that speak to me. These artworks aren’t just decorative; they also represent memories and connections to people and places that mean a lot to me.In addition to the Chilean photographer, there is plenty more South American art to discover.Basulto: When it came to choosing objects for our apartment, it occurred to me that a lot more pieces are available to us than I had first thought. For example, I started working with the Holder Objects gallery in Berlin, which brings Latin American designers to Germany and the Nordic countries. The stool here [editor’s note: the Tori stool by Ries] comes from Argentina, for example. That’s exciting because it has such a special history. It’s made of cast aluminum, and I immediately thought of it for Berlin. It feels really raw, the way graffiti does. We also have some works by Ukrainian painters, including a painting by Machareva who is a very nice artist from Kyiv. Then there are other works from Chile as well. It feels like we’re creating a connection through these artworks and objects to different places and cultures in our life, which I value a lot.How would you describe Berlin in three words?Basulto: Raw, intense, and creative.Karas: Eclectic, creative, and… casual.This 900-square-foot apartment tour first appeared in AD Germany.

I learned about the Ukrainian-German company \u003ca data-offer-url=\"https://www.planb-works.de/\" data-event-click=\"{\u0026#34;element\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;ExternalLink\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;outgoingURL\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.planb-works.de/\u0026#34;}\" href=\"https://www.planb-works.de/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePlan B\u003c/a\u003e in an issue of \u003cem\u003eAD\u003c/em\u003e.

I love the work of \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/sabine-marcelis-and-hem-join-forces-on-this-delicious-new-design\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSabine Marcelis\u003c/a\u003e whose design approach inspired me. The wardrobe was just what I wanted, and its design exactly what I had imagined. It’s simply wonderful. The color palette was the only thing that was adjusted slightly. At first, we had wanted a bright orange wardrobe, but in the end we went with a soft peach which gives the room a warm, inviting atmosphere. I\u0026#39;m also particularly proud of the table from \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/sarah-ellison-muse-sofa-review\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSarah Ellison\u003c/a\u003e, an Australian brand that I really like. Australia and its extraordinary design scene and natural beauty have fascinated us for years. The thought of actually bringing this furniture here initially seemed almost impossible. But thanks to David’s contacts at Sarah Ellison, the dream became a reality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBasulto: In the end, the table and chairs arrived here from Australia faster than furniture we ordered in Europe.

Over time, we’ve built up a small collection. When I was a student, I bought a painting that I really loved by an Estonian artist. It still has a special significance for me. The work feels like it fits harmoniously in the space here. We also have a close relationship with a photographer from Chile. She takes pictures of these triangular buildings found all over Chile that are used as summer houses. Her photos add a personal touch to our home and tell stories that speak to me. These artworks aren’t just decorative; they also represent memories and connections to people and places that mean a lot to me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn addition to the Chilean photographer, there is plenty more South American art to discover.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBasulto: When it came to choosing objects for our apartment, it occurred to me that a lot more pieces are available to us than I had first thought.

That’s exciting because it has such a special history. It’s made of cast aluminum, and I immediately thought of it for Berlin. It feels really raw, the way graffiti does. We also have some works by Ukrainian painters, including a painting by Machareva who is a very nice artist from Kyiv. Then there are other works from Chile as well. It feels like we’re creating a connection through these artworks and objects to different places and cultures in our life, which I value a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow would you describe Berlin in three words?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBasulto: Raw, intense, and creative.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKaras: Eclectic, creative, and… casual.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis 900-square-foot apartment tour first appeared in\u003c/em\u003e AD Germany. \u003cem\u003eIt was translated by John Oseid.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"RowWrapper\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli data-testid=\"LinkStackBullet\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot a subscriber? \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/v2/offers/ard318?source=SITE_0_ARD_HCL_IN_ARTICLE_0_LINK_LISTS_2024_ZZ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJoin \u003cem\u003eAD\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e for print and digital access now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli data-testid=\"LinkStackBullet\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli data-testid=\"LinkStackBullet\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli data-testid=\"LinkStackBullet\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli data-testid=\"LinkStackBullet\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli data-testid=\"LinkStackBullet\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli data-testid=\"LinkStackBullet\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli data-testid=\"LinkStackBullet\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli data-testid=\"LinkStackBullet\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli data-testid=\"LinkStackBullet\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eSign up for our \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/newsletter\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edaily newsletter\u003c/a\u003e to get the best of design in your inbox.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
