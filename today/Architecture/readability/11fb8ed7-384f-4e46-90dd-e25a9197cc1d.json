Around 80 members of the AD PRO Directory joined the Nickey Kehoe team and AD’s West Coast editor, Mayer Rus, to introduce new products, mingle with fellow designers, and talk all things decorating.The AD100 designers Nickey Kehoe have two locations: a flagship in Los Angeles and a recently opened showroom in a historic New York town house.

Photography Courtesy of Nickey KehoeAs the night kicked off around 5 p.m., conversations were immediately flowing. One attendee dished to Rus about a new client. Another mentioned a moody bachelor pad he just wrapped up work on. An architect and designer duo discussed a new project in the pipeline.But the evening wasn’t all work and no play. Others enjoyed a glass of wine beneath the towering monstera plant anchored in the middle of the showroom. Those seeking a quieter spot opted for chats on a cozy sofa in the back of the shop, tucked away in a room hung with fabric swatches.Drinks at the showroom's Plain English kitchen, provided by Avaline Photography Courtesy of Nickey KehoeGuests nibbled from charcuterie boards while sipping Sauvignon Blanc and sparkling wine by Avaline or, for those avoiding a Friday morning hangover, Ghia’s zesty non-alcoholic aperitif, Le Fizz—though one cheeky guest elected to bring her own whiskey.As is the case with many parties, the kitchen was a popular watering hole. Designers coalesced around the butcher-block-topped island in the model Plain English kitchen while dipping hunks of Gjusta bread into tzatziki and hummus.The showroom was peppered with pieces that showcased Nickey Kehoe’s new collaboration with Farrow \u0026 Ball. One standout dining table was painted in Charlotte’s Locks, a fiery peach hue, which popped against a set of sturdy blond wood chairs. Custom Nickey Kehoe Collection furniture is newly available in nearly 300 Farrow \u0026 Ball shades, from playful brights to rich jewel tones.AD PRO Directory members—some of whom made the trek from Orange County and the Valley—agreed that the chance to talk shop with fellow designers was an opportunity they didn’t want to miss.“Owning your own design firm in LA can be a little isolating—you’re working in your own office or at your house. So it’s so nice to get out and connect with other designers,” says Alex Yeske of Alex Yeske Interiors.Mayer Rus, AD’s West Coast editor, toasts at the event. Photography Courtesy of Nickey KehoeThe momentum paused only briefly as guests gathered for remarks from Rus and Medora Danz, president of Nickey Kehoe. “AD PRO and the AD PRO Directory was a vision of my boss, Amy Astley, from the time she came to Architectural Digest,” said Rus, “so thank you for being a part of that community.”Danz echoed the sentiment of gratitude. “The work that you do [and] the creativity that you put forth to clients is an extension of the creativity we feel and want to share every day,” she said. “So thank you so much for choosing our things, for choosing this profession, for supporting each other, and for supporting us.”Glasses were raised, and the party continued.",
