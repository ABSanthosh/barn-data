  "text": "Architizer is delighted to announce that Sanjay Puri, principal architect of Sanjay Puri Architects, has joined the jury for the 2025 Vision Awards. Known for his dynamic and expressive designs across India and beyond, Puri brings an extraordinary depth of experience in concept-driven projects and urban planning, making him an ideal juror for a program dedicated to celebrating the most powerful ideas and imagery in architecture. To have your work reviewed by Sanjay Puri, Steven Holl, Daniel Libeskind and more, and get your work in the running for publication this season, share your vision for architecture in the 2025 Vision Awards: Enter the Vision Awards Since founding his Mumbai-based practice in 1992, Puri has led the design of projects spanning architecture, interior design, master planning, product design and even event design across more than 54 Indian cities. Under his leadership, Sanjay Puri Architects has earned over 360 international awards, establishing the firm as one of the most innovative and globally recognized design studios operating today. His distinctive, sculptural buildings are celebrated for their striking geometries, sensitivity to climate and context, and thoughtful engagement with the cultural fabric of their sites. Puri’s work exemplifies architecture as a narrative force, where bold forms and carefully choreographed spaces convey deeper spatial and social meaning. Beyond practice, Puri is an influential voice in global design discourse. He has served on the jury of major awards including the Architizer’s A+Awards, the World Architecture Festival, Inde Awards Australia, Dezeen Awards UK, and the Architectural Review Awards UK. He has also spoken at leading architectural events worldwide, from London and Amsterdam to Venice and Singapore, offering insights into the evolving role of architecture in fast-changing urban and cultural contexts. As a juror for the Vision Awards, Puri brings particular resonance to categories celebrating architectural unbuilt ideas for civic and communal spaces, including Vision for Cities, Vision for Education and more (click here for your complete guide to Vision Awards categories). His experience leading a practice at the forefront of conceptual design will provide invaluable perspective as the jury evaluates entries that challenge conventions and envision new futures. The 2025 Vision Awards is a global platform honoring the world’s most creative architectural ideas and images, across drawings, renderings, photography, video, models and speculative projects. Winners will be published in the Visionary 100 and featured in both Metropolis Magazine and Architizer’s upcoming print volume, How to Visualize Architecture. Be part of the world’s leading celebration of architectural imagery and ideas — and have your work reviewed by Sanjay Puri and a global jury of design leaders! The Final Entry Deadline is July 11th, 2025. Start My Entry Top image: STUDIOS 90 by Sanjay Puri Architects, Kodla, India",
