Consider options like firing up the grilling station, a stylish pizza oven, or enjoying a meal under a pergola along with friends and family. No matter what you choose, a well-designed outdoor kitchen should feel like an extension of the interior space, seamlessly integrating functionality, aesthetics, and durability, says Margaret Donaldson, CEO and principal designer at MDI Luxury Design.“The outdoor living, dining, and cooking space become a peaceful spot to connect with nature,” says Donaldson, who emphasizes that countertops, appliances, plumbing fixtures, and furnishings must be durable and suitable for extreme weather. Whether overlooking a beautiful pool or an incredible landscape, Donaldson says the goal in designing an outdoor kitchen is “to provide adequate cooking space for the homeowner while not making it the focus.” Since people will likely be gathering around the outdoor kitchen in the same way they do in an interior one, comfortable dining and lounge seating near the cooking area are key components to craft a relaxed setting. Rhode Island–based interior designer Lindy Lowney recommends grounding the soft seating with an outdoor rug, pillows, and an outdoor throw to bring the interior comfort outside with style, while maintaining function.An outdoor kitchen can be an overwhelming project, filled with questions you need to answer about everything from materials to price points. To help you get started, we spoke with a variety of designers who have created unique ones for inspiration. Maybe you’re just looking for design ideas for an outdoor kitchen, or you want something new to complement your backyard landscaping. Perhaps you’re considering hiring a design professional, or maybe you’re feeling inspired to take on the project yourself. Whichever way you’re looking to go, below are plenty of outdoor kitchen designs to spark your imagination… and your appetite.1. Backsplash beautyNancy Epstein’s striking tile backsplash. Photo: Courtesy of Artistic TileA uniquely patterned backsplash is a stunning focal point and a great place to start when searching for patio kitchen ideas. Nancy Epstein, founder and chairman of the board at Artistic Tile, chose walls of a custom glass mosaic in a languid lily pad pattern for her home. Under limestone columns wrapped with star jasmine plants, the space is delightfully fragrant. “My own yard feels as lush and indulgent as the finest outdoor spaces I have experienced anywhere in the world, and I use it almost every day from spring to fall,” says Epstein.2. Continuous countertopsIndoor-outdoor living is at its finest in this space by Kern \u0026 Co. Photo: Courtesy of Kern \u0026 Co.A very popular outdoor kitchen trend is the extension of the kitchen island outside to create bar seating, like in this home by Kern \u0026 Co. Through a large kitchen window, the countertops connect the indoor space to the outdoor entertaining area.3. Serenity and styleMary Patton Design created this outdoor kitchen with many of the amenities of an indoor living room. Photo: Molly CulverComfortable lounge furniture, sleek appliances, and clever storage space is always a win. Houston-based Mary Patton of Mary Patton Design says clients have been asking for kitchen spaces that evoke a balance of serenity and sophistication with a touch of fun. “Amenities like a fireplace or a television create the perfect environment for entertaining,” Patton adds.4. Year-round useHeaters and screens can make your outdoor living area usable in off seasons. Photo: Darren SetlowMaking use of an outdoor kitchen year-round can be difficult in all climates. Cathy Purple Cherry, founder and principal of Purple Cherry Architects, found a way to make the most of all seasons at this Virginia pool house. Its outdoor kitchen can be used nearly all year long thanks to a translucent roll-down screen hidden in the wood-planked ceiling that can be lowered and tied off. There are also infrared ceiling-mounted heaters.5. Poolside pizza ovenA pizza oven brings the pizzazz to this project by Bob White. Photo: Stanly Ranch ResidencesTucked in the vineyards in Napa Valley, this Stanly Ranch home, designed by Bob White, has a pizza oven next to the grilling station, with plenty of space for food prep. “When a home is designed right, they are about celebrating, creating, and honoring a sense of place, capturing moments and memories in people’s lives—all with a spectacular view,” says White.6. Wood cabinetryTake cues from Marie Flanigan and model your outdoor kitchen cabinets after your interior ones. Photo: Julie SoeferSoft and welcoming, this wood cabinetry from Marie Flanigan Interiors creates a rustic enclave with plenty of storage space inside the kitchen cabinets.7. Urban kitchen with a viewAn outdoor kitchen on an urban rooftop? Why not. Photo: Jack VatcherCity dwellers can experience the best kitchen design ideas as well. “Our goal was to make it easy for residents to have that backyard experience,” says Matthew Snyder, co-owner and co-developer of The Archer in Boston’s Beacon Hill.8. White brick and steelWhite brick sets the tone in this project by Marie Flanigan. Photo: Courtesy of Marie Flanigan InteriorsAdding contrast to the steel doors that open up to the sitting room, this white brick stands out. “The bar just in front of the grill adds a place to sit, relax, enjoy a drink, and linger a little longer,” says Marie Flanigan of Marie Flanigan Interiors. “This kitchen is the best of outdoor living.”9. Custom millworkThe kitchenette in this Miami home feels like it is one with the outdoors. Photo: Lifestyle Production GroupThis Bali-inspired home by Miami-based designer Brittany Farinas of House of One features a kitchenette that blurs the line between indoors and outdoors. “We incorporate millwork into our projects, so the space was perfect to create a custom-built feature, and the stone was carefully sourced by Opustone,” says Farinas.10. More pizza ovensA pizza oven is a great visual element for an outdoor space—with delicious results. Photo: Courtesy of Ojai Valley InnA pizza oven is a highly coveted asset for outdoor kitchens. At the Ojai Valley Inn’s Casa Elar, the Tuscan-style kitchen’s outdoor pizza oven makes an unexpected yet integrated focal point at the resort’s culinary events space, The Farmhouse.11. Covered patioCovered patios are a very comfortable way to experience outdoor dining. Photo: Caitlin AtkinsonWeather is unpredictable, but a covered patio can be enjoyed in almost any environment. This Jennifer Risko Smith design creates a shelter from the storm while connecting the indoor kitchen with the pool area, main kitchen, and dining in between. “You can easily pass things to the outdoor kitchen and service the counter and table seating from inside,” says Smith.12. Seamless flowOutdoor zones seamlessly flow together at this resort. Photo: Francisco Estrada/Courtesy of Auberge Resorts CollectionAt Brisa del Mar at Chileno Bay Resort \u0026 Residences, the six-bedroom villa’s indoor-outdoor kitchen has a clean, contemporary aesthetic with an open floor plan and spacious outdoor area.13. Concrete and stoneA cool-toned modern outdoor kitchen is all the rage. Photo: Chipper Hatter/BelgardCool-toned color palettes and modern design styles are extremely popular. Consider elegant pavers or stacked stone. “These materials create smooth, clean lines that complement other elements, like stainless-steel appliances, and coordinate well with pops of color,” says Joe Raboine, director of residential hardscapes at Belgard.14. Marble and woodMeredith Owen applied marble countertops to this outdoor kitchen design. Photo: Molly CulverA strong contrast of marble and wood creates an elegant yet welcoming space in this outdoor kitchen by Meredith Owen Interiors, which is adjacent to the indoor kitchen for ease. “Meals are easily prepped inside and brought out to be grilled. This kitchen overlooks the pool and outdoor dining and living areas, which means the entertaining doesn’t stop, even if you’re grilling burgers,” says Owen.15. Backyard beautyNature is your friend when it comes to creating a beautiful outdoor kitchen setup. Photo: Studio William HefnerThis Studio William Hefner kitchen embraces the natural landscape surrounding it. Tucked away in the backyard, the greenery serves as an ideal backdrop.16. Dining area dramaA striking backyard dining area by Sterling Huddleson Architecture. Photo: Wayne CapiliWhile the kitchen is important for prep, you may want to put the focus on your outdoor dining area, like in this well-lit outdoor space created by Sterling Huddleson Architecture.17. Fireside comfortFirepits are great at defining hangout zones. Photo: BinyanCozy up by the outdoor fireplace and enjoy the views around you. At The Parker, a new building in Boston, Linda Zarifi of Linda Zarifi Design created an elegant firepit area that’s ideal for outdoor entertaining.18. Indoor-outdoor integrationAmanda Barnes Interiors designed an outdoor kitchen that’s directly adjacent to the indoor one. Photo and Styling: Alyssa RosenheckThis outdoor space was built to mirror the adjacent indoor space, explains Amanda Barnes of Amanda Barnes Interiors. “You can read the barbecue thermometer from the kitchen window so you can prep inside and keep an eye on everything outside,” says Barnes.19. Shady sectionIncorporate plants into your outdoor kitchen design. Photo: Jane BeilesThis Design Lines Signature space offers an escape from the sun-drenched pool area and allows lush plants to serve as outdoor decor. “Nature is the backdrop here,” says designer Judy Pickett.20. Waterfront grilling stationChoose materials that won’t erode in the elements. Photo: Drew BirchFire up the gas grill with the natural beauty of the water flowing behind you. Bridgette Caporaso of Sketch Design Studio chose organic materials like wood and concrete for this waterfront home since “salt, water, and sun exposure is very abrasive on many finishes.”21. Textured backsplashA textured backsplash creates an interesting focal point. Photo: Venjhamin ReyesAdd a punch to your backsplash with texture, like in this property by Design West that features quartz and tiles. “Our design teams chose to use a textured backsplash in these spaces to add depth, interest, and visual appeal to the areas,” says Morgan Bratcher, lead designer, and Caitlin Godwin, interior designer.22. Rooftop kitchenDesign your outdoor kitchen space around your lifestyle needs. Photo: Brie Williams. Styling: Kendra SurfaceWhether you’re having a chat around the firepit or lounging with a good book, this rooftop embraces distinct rooms, says Judy Pickett of Design Lines Signature. “Versatility is key when designing spaces—nowadays you can do so many activities outdoors, and having a space that is designed specifically for all of these potential activities is important.”23. Fireplace loungeThe colorful pillows add a splash of color to the outdoor kitchen area. Photo: Caitlin AtkinsonAn outdoor living room is ideal for entertaining, especially in this Jennifer Risko Smith–designed property. “This outdoor kitchen features modern details and pops of color,” says Smith. “It is one hundred percent focused on providing every comfort of the interior outside—beer on tap, barbecue, counter seating, and an adjacent fireplace lounge area and full dining area with heaters, interesting lighting, and views.” Grab a seat by the fireplace and soak up the greenery that surrounds it.24. Grilling and smokingThis project takes grilling and smoking to the next level. Photo: Jeffrey Brian RiemerDesigned for a client that’s a high-end grilling and smoking enthusiast, Kate Anne Gross of Kate Anne Designs said the design team “had to really step up our outdoor kitchen game to meet the expectations.”“The key was incorporating everything without it looking cluttered or taking away from the aesthetics of the island itself,” says Gross. A waterfall polished-cement counter creates a modern, industrial look.25. Bluestone, brick, and shiplapUnexpected materials play nicely together in this space by Kate Anne Designs. Photo: Jeffrey Brian RiemerAsked to combine a decorative backdrop with architectural lighting at this East Coast home, the Kate Anne Designs team combined a rustic creamy brick veneer with bluestone, contrasting it with white shiplap.26. Jewel-toned accentsYour outdoor kitchen area doesn’t need to be devoid of color. Photo: Julie SoeferRich blues and reds pop against organic, natural furnishings and a lime-washed masonry exterior in this home by Benjamin Johnston Design. “The home’s interior color story ranges from earthy neutrals to moody jewel tones, and that palette served as the foundation for this area’s design,” says Johnston.27. Walk-up barA striking bar brings out the vacation vibes. Photo: Courtesy of Benjamin Johnston DesignWith a resort-style vibe in mind, Benjamin Johnston Design created this outdoor kitchen with a walk-up bar at the far end of the pool under a pavilion. “A covered outdoor dining space is essential in the summer, and the walk-up bar and full outdoor kitchen are great for larger events, while still perfect for a weekend barbecue with family as well,” says Johnston.28. Prioritizing privacyTuck away the grill so the focus remains elsewhere. Photo: Julie SoeferA cozy nook can offer privacy, as well as all the necessary tools and equipment for cooking up a feast. “This grill area was incredibly important, as the homeowners are restaurateurs with a passion for entertaining,” says Marie Flanigan of Marie Flanigan Interiors. “Despite the grill being offset, it’s proximal to the outdoor eating and living areas for maximum efficiency.”29. Mini fridge momentWhen it comes to outdoor kitchens, mini fridges are your friend. Photo: Madeline HarperMake the most of your space with a mini fridge, which provides easy access when you’re ready to enjoy some outdoor dining. Arterberry Cooke and Captex Construction created this accessible space with a stunning view.30. Organic fibersOrganic materials make this Costa Rican kitchen sing. Photo: Courtesy of Auberge Resorts CollectionAt El Cultivo, Hacienda AltaGracia’s organic garden and kitchen in Costa Rica, New York–based designer Nina Gotlieb used a neutral color palette and rich textures of wood, stone, and organic fibers.31. Pink and blackPink and black make for a fun, graphic contrast. Photo: Life CreatedColor reigns supreme, even if it’s subtle. Lauren Lerner of Living With Lolo says an outdoor kitchen doesn’t need to be elaborate to be functional. “We had a large island and only a grill. The pink grill adds an unexpected touch to this outdoor cooking space,” says Lerner. She also recommends adding lighting around the grill so you can cook after sunset.32. Poolside placementMake your outdoor kitchen stand out with its own designated structure. Photo: Jenifer McNeil BakerIt’s all about location. Eddie Maestri of Maestri Studio wanted to create a functional structure that complemented this home’s architecture. “The placement of the structure allows adults to prepare food or drinks while maintaining an eye on children in the pool,” says Maestri. The firepit and overhead heaters are a desirable touch.33. Built-in seatingMaximize space with a built-in banquette. Photo: Julie SoeferEven a small outdoor kitchen can have a comfortable dining area. “Consider a banquette built into the patio wall. Providing both a soft seating area and reducing the footprint of a dining table and chairs, banquettes are a delightful small-space solution,” says Courtnay Tartt Elias of Creative Tonic Design.34. Shady StyleA sturdy shade structure is crucial in a canyon setting like this one. Photo: Anthony BarceloPerched at the top of a canyon in the Hollywood Hills, designer Kishani Perera knew that the unpredictable weather could be pretty extreme on this client’s patio. “Shade was a vital component when designing this outdoor kitchen, so our clients opted to build a sturdy structure to ensure the elements never impeded their entertaining,” Perera noted.35. Peninsula powerThe layout of an outdoor kitchen is just as essential as the design of one indoors. Photo: Lissa GotwalsThe flow in this kitchen designed by Carrie Moore Interior Design is optimized thanks to the banquette that allows for quick passing of plates back and forth. “You can easily pass your guests’ plates, as the dining area is directly adjacent to the working kitchen peninsula,” Moore shared. The connection to dining and living spaces also allows for hosting a crowd, even while whipping up a pie in the outdoor pizza oven.36. Biophilic and beautifulSubtle nods to a love of horses are incorporated in this Florida outdoor kitchen. Photo: Michael McVeyA Florida equestrian-inspired home embraces the core principles of biophilic design by featuring carefully curated elements of greenery. “Where does the inside end and the outside begin?” says Joey Conicella, president of Soco Interiors. “We’ve blended the two in a way that connects the homeowner to their natural environment while giving them the comforts and amenities of a luxury home.”37. Desert luxuryStrong lines contrast the softer vegetation, which creates a dynamic design. Photo: Lance GerberThe seamless integration of architecture and nature is clear in this Palm Springs outdoor kitchen designed and built by Beau Laughlin of Framework Design + Build. Tucked under a cantilever slatted pergola, the kitchen “not only provides shade and comfort but also acts as a visual bridge between the home and the stark beauty of the Palm Springs landscape,” says Laughlin.38. Dazzling string lightsA little bit of twinkle goes a long way. Photo: Catherine NguyenAn outdoor kitchen designed by Becky Shea blends Scandinavian design with natural outdoor elements and a fun addition of string lights. A listing represented by Gretchen Coley at Compass, it features materials like concrete and warm wood to create a stylish and functional space that opens up to a spacious North Carolina backyard.39. Stucco stylePergolas laced with greenery, an airy designated dining area, and a stately fireplace are all outdoor kitchen ideas that will make your backyard space an oasis. Photo: Alanna HaleA Marin County outdoor kitchen designed by Rebekah Zaveloff of Impairfait Design Studio incorporates stucco and painted brick with bluestone caps along the perimeter, contrasting with the graphic encaustic concrete floor tile. Tasteful landscape design completes the outdoor oasis. “It was my first time designing a custom pergola and outdoor space entirely from scratch, and this home was the perfect opportunity to create an outdoor oasis that felt—and truly is—one with nature,” Zaveloff says.40. Sustainability in focusThis outdoor kitchen is shielded from precipitation but still gets a great view of the surrounding greenery with open walls. Photo: Brown Jordan Outdoor KitchensSome clients are turning away from high-maintenance setups and instead leaning into sustainable options for their outdoor kitchens, say Brown Jordan Outdoor Kitchens and Danver creative director Daniel Germani. In this Tennessee project, resilient pieces integrate seamlessly with the space, like the stainless-steel grill sitting perfectly surrounded by Pompeiian Gold cabinetry. “Every day, more people are blurring the line between indoors and outdoors. Think comfy furniture, well-designed outdoor kitchens, intimate lighting, and outdoor fireplaces,” Germani says.41. Opt for an elevated neutral paletteThe dining and lounge areas of this outdoor kitchen both have a prime view of the family’s lush lawn. Photo: Laure JulietA seamless flow is easy and breezy in this Regan Baker Design outdoor kitchen and dining area, where neutral tones play off the natural beauty of the surrounding backyard oasis. Green dining chairs and gray cushions function as tranquil finishing touches. “The completely open sides embrace the indoor-outdoor feel of the home’s unique build while drapery offers a functional and elevated feel to the space,” Baker says.42. Mosaic magnificenceA mosaic wall invigorates this outdoor kitchen and sitting area. Photo: Courtesy of ArtaicFine art and mosaic design come together on the patio of this Massachusetts residence, which features stainless-steel appliances under a mosaic installation created with half-inch vitreous glass. A collaboration between Artaic and artist Susan Davies (who used one of her original paintings as the mosaic’s inspiration), the kitchen enhances the ambiance of the outdoor space that’s tucked in the coastal hamlet of Salisbury. Grab a seat in the hanging chairs and curl up your bare feet after a day at the beach.43. Go darkA dark palette adds some unexpected drama. Photo: Stacy Zarin GoldbergInstead of buying a vacation property, a Virginia family turned to Joseph Richardson of Richardson \u0026 Associates Landscape Architecture to transform their home’s entire landscape. A pool house, painted a deep charcoal gray, serves as the perfect focal point for the garden—while offering a fireplace and outdoor bar for cozy gathering spaces. Richardson created a staggered evergreen screen of Arborvitae, hydrangea, Karl Foerster grass, and flowering accent trees. “They embarked on creating a resort for themselves, their kids, and their friends, right there at home,” he says of the family.44. Showcase the sunsetThis outdoor kitchen was made with its picturesque natural surroundings top of mind. Photo: Blaine Johnathan PhotographyA cozy quartet of swivel gliders makes for the perfect spot to take in a Florida sunset in this outdoor kitchen designed by Alex Thies, owner and creative director of Adelyn Charles Interiors in Bonita Springs, Florida. “This outdoor kitchen has the best of both worlds: completely open to the stunning beach beyond but covered and surrounded by a concealed track for motorized mosquito screens and hurricane shutters that operate at the press of a button,” Thies says. A collaboration project with Harper Haus Interiors, the kitchen features dark quartzite countertops that extend down into a waterfall, creating a two-sided bar for optimal entertaining and sunset viewing.45. Elevated your lawn terraceThe greenery around this elevated outdoor kitchen gives it a storybook atmosphere. Photo: Kate WichlinskiThe cooking area in this outdoor kitchen space floats above an elegant lawn terrace surrounded by a sinuous retaining wall in this space by Richardson \u0026 Associates Landscape Architecture. The owners, a couple who frequently entertain, requested an outdoor kitchen that included classic features, like a grill, refrigerator, and storage, as well as a reorganization of the backyard and a comprehensive planting scheme. “Below the wall, stone paths with grass or ajuga-filled joints circumnavigate through the lower woodland parts of the garden and up along the sides of the house,” Richardson says. “Distinctive but discreet lighting shows the way.”46. Tap into calm and cool palettesThe muted color scheme of this outdoor kitchen makes for a calming atmosphere. Photo: Bjorg MagneaA Hamptons outdoor kitchen setup features a large stone monolith that incorporates a barbecue grill. Ample countertop space provides plenty of room for working and serving, while stainless-steel drawers assist with storage. “We prioritized materials that withstand the elements and that also help the design integrate seamlessly into the site with a soft and cool color palette,” says Philip Consalvo, principal of PJCArchitecture. An adjacent patio with a large table sits next to a low wall with hydrangea bushes overlooking the pool.47. Craft a poolside loungeThis outdoor kitchen is perfect for fixing up something to eat on long summer days at the pool. Photo: OldcastleA striking backyard scene for a midcentury-style home in Texas includes several stainless-steel outdoor kitchen appliances, like a grill, pizza oven, refrigeration, and storage for easy hosting and entertaining. Above the main kitchen area, playful design accents are created with composite decking. “This property really lent itself to a unique design, and the outdoor kitchen was no exception,” says Joe Raboine, Vice President of Design at Oldcastle APG. “The kitchen has the conveniences needed for entertaining friends and family, and it has easy access to a beautiful pool to escape the Texas heat.”Frequently asked questions about outdoor kitchen ideasWhat are the trends for outdoor kitchens in 2025?Simply put, seamless integration is the name of the game for 2025.“In 2025, homeowners are seeking true functioning kitchens that enable a full outdoor entertaining experience,” Consalvo says. This includes audio/visual systems that provide music and TV options, lighting fixtures that go the distance from practical task lighting to ambiance cultivation, and readily available appliances and fixtures that create a fully functioning kitchen. Think of appliances that go beyond the typical grill, with elements such as burners, sinks, dishwashers, ice makers, and pizza ovens.Consalvo also notes that homeowners are eager for supply storage that provides a spot for everything from cookware and dishes to glasses and utensils. He’s seen that protection from the elements—pergolas, retractable roofs, awnings, and screens—are in demand, as is the use of sustainable materials that are locally sourced, natural, and appropriate for the site location, says Consalvo, who notes that the best materials work well for the design intention but also withstand the outdoor elements. Thoughtful landscaping, which can help create privacy and provide shelter from the breeze, is a trend that never goes out of style.Can you have an outdoor kitchen in a cooler climate?Living in a cooler climate doesn’t have to mean you can’t embrace an outdoor kitchen. However, certain components need to be taken into consideration.“We recommend looking for cold-rated appliances and materials that can withstand colder climates, such as granite, stainless steel, and marine-grade material,” Consalvo says. In addition to thinking about the materials with which you construct the space, Consalvo says it’s essential to prioritize the comfort of the people who will be congregating there in more frigid seasons. He recommends incorporating features such as heaters and overhead covers like a pergola or a solid roof structure to accommodate everyone. Additional options include wind screens, which can protect both appliances and the people enjoying the outdoor kitchen, and thoughtful landscaping, which can help provide areas of shelter and windbreaks.What are the best design styles for an outdoor kitchen?While there isn’t a single style that reigns supreme, designers agree that the best outdoor kitchens are the ones that combine functionality with ease. “The best outdoor kitchens aren’t just about cooking—they’re about living,” says Tracy Kurc of Tracy Kurc Interiors. “A truly great outdoor space flexes effortlessly: morning coffee, weeknight BBQs, late-night dinner parties under the stars. It’s beyond the grill. It’s about hosting, lounging, and encouraging you to live outside.”Kurc often designs the kitchen and lounge areas “as one fluid experience” that emphasizes items for everyday use. Think functional luxuries like built-in fridges, ice makers, and warming drawers, combined with a pergola or roof for shade and shelter, and layered lighting like outdoor chandeliers, sconces, and moveable lanterns. Also, the warmth of a fireplace or discreet heaters will let you stretch the season well into sweater weather.Of course, design features that take a cue from the outdoor setting and embrace “the natural world” are ideal, says Kurc, who favors trellises draped with climbing hydrangeas, herb gardens, and oversized planters to anchor and define spaces. It’s the special touches that mean the most to the people who use that space that truly make it feel complete, like a wood-burning pizza oven or a tabletop s’mores maker.“The goal is to make it feel curated yet effortless so you linger a little longer,” she adds.Are there any must-have components of an outdoor kitchen?When it comes to important components of a functional and enjoyable outdoor kitchen, Donaldson recommends people focus on a few major features. First up is the grilling and cooking station, since it’s essential to understand how the homeowner prefers to cook when selecting an appliance. Next is the countertops, which provide adequate workspace and a surface that needs to hold up to the elements, including salt air in many circumstances. Next is the sink, since having water access for cooking and cleanup is efficient and convenient. “No one wants to take dripping food containers or dirty utensils back through the house,” Donaldson adds.While lighting is often overlooked, it increases the usability of an outdoor kitchen and also provides an element of safety. Also, shade and cover protect from the sun and rain, and allow the space to be used more frequently. “After all, cooking outdoors and dining al fresco during a summer rain shower can be a lovely experience!” Donaldson concludes.What are the best materials to use for an outdoor kitchen?“Stainless steel is very durable and easy to clean,” says Lowney. “It withstands moisture and heat and holds up well to the outdoor elements.” When it comes to the countertops, Lowney suggests granite because of its strength and durability with minimal maintenance. “With a strong commercial sealer, it will resist staining and moisture. Porcelain is also becoming popular due its ease of maintenance and attractive price point,” she adds.How much does it cost to build an outdoor kitchen?Certainly, building a full-size outdoor kitchen with a prep area, stainless-steel appliances, and a kegerator is a pricey option. Lowney says that it’s “really difficult to put a number on” outdoor kitchens, since “cost can vary greatly depending on the design, size, labor required, and materials you use.” However, many people choose to DIY their own outdoor kitchen, working to plan and build the space with a strict budget. Remember, even a humble mini fridge next to a wisely designed counter space can be the foundation of your outdoor kitchen design. When you’re dining al fresco, having your own outdoor kitchen can be enjoyable with just a pair of comfortable bar stools at a high-top table.Does adding an outdoor kitchen increase the value of your home?Because an outdoor kitchen expands the usable space of your home and enhances the property’s overall appeal, it will ultimately increase the value of your home.“This is particularly true in areas with favorable climates, as they offer opportunities for relaxed entertaining and cooking while connecting with nature, which is a lifestyle goal for many homebuyers,” says Donaldson. However, she also notes that the extent to which an outdoor kitchen impacts a home's value can vary depending on factors such as the quality of construction, design, and local real estate market conditions.How do you keep costs down when building an outdoor kitchen?If you’re looking to expand your outdoor space, Donaldson recommends sticking to a budget that prioritizes which features are most important to you. Since weather-resistant products can often be more costly than their interior counterparts, consider practical, yet lower-cost materials to use such as concrete, stainless steel, or composite material for cabinetry. “It is best to keep it simple in an outdoor kitchen, eliminating the aesthetic bells and whistles, if budget is a concern,” Donaldson added. Consider the outdoor elements as your design inspiration and aesthetic and let the cooking station be just that, functional, and practical, but not too showy. As for where you shouldn’t attempt to save money, Donaldson recommends that people never cut corners when it comes to safety features. “High-quality materials, proper ventilation, and professional installation protect against fire or gas leaks,” she adds. Additionally, waterproofing measures will contribute to the longevity of the outdoor kitchen.What do I do about my outdoor patio kitchen during the winter?There are so many variables that go into designing an outdoor entertainment space, with one of the most important ones being the environment you live in. Folks who live in dry areas with little precipitation don’t have to worry as much about the threat of snow or hurricanes. By building a covered patio kitchen, you aren’t as limited to when you can use the space. Lowney, who based in New England, recommends building a covered kitchen area to ensure it lasts longer. “It extends the longevity of the investment,” she notes.Below, browse a range of backyard kitchen ideas to get you started on your outdoor kitchen journey.",

This includes audio/visual systems that provide music and TV options, lighting fixtures that go the distance from practical task lighting to ambiance cultivation, and readily available appliances and fixtures that create a fully functioning kitchen. Think of appliances that go beyond the typical grill, with elements such as burners, sinks, dishwashers, ice makers, and pizza ovens.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConsalvo also notes that homeowners are eager for supply storage that provides a spot for everything from cookware and dishes to glasses and utensils. He’s seen that protection from the elements—\u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/pergola-ideas\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epergolas\u003c/a\u003e, retractable roofs, awnings, and screens—are in demand, as is the use of \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/topic/sustainability\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esustainable materials\u003c/a\u003e that are locally sourced, natural, and appropriate for the site location, says Consalvo, who notes that the best materials work well for the design intention but also withstand the outdoor elements.

However, certain components need to be taken into consideration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We recommend looking for cold-rated appliances and materials that can withstand colder climates, such as granite, stainless steel, and marine-grade material,” Consalvo says. In addition to thinking about the materials with which you construct the space, Consalvo says it’s essential to prioritize the comfort of the people who will be \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/outdoor-entertaining-seating-ideas-slideshow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003econgregating\u003c/a\u003e there in more frigid seasons. He recommends incorporating features such as heaters and overhead covers like a pergola or a solid roof structure to accommodate everyone. Additional options include wind screens, which can protect both appliances and the people enjoying the outdoor kitchen, and thoughtful landscaping, which can help provide areas of shelter and windbreaks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat are the best design styles for an outdoor kitchen?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile there isn’t a single style that reigns supreme, designers agree that the best outdoor kitchens are the ones that combine functionality with ease. “The best outdoor kitchens aren’t just about cooking—they’re about living,” says Tracy Kurc of \u003ca data-offer-url=\"https://www.tracykurc.com/\" data-event-click=\"{\u0026#34;element\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;ExternalLink\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;outgoingURL\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.tracykurc.com/\u0026#34;}\" href=\"https://www.tracykurc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTracy Kurc Interiors\u003c/a\u003e. “A truly great outdoor space flexes effortlessly: \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/coffee-bar-ideas\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emorning coffee\u003c/a\u003e, weeknight BBQs, late-night \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/culture-lifestyle/entertaining\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edinner parties\u003c/a\u003e under the stars. It’s beyond the grill. It’s about hosting, lounging, and encouraging you to live outside.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKurc often designs the kitchen and lounge areas “as one fluid experience” that emphasizes items for everyday use. Think functional luxuries like built-in fridges, ice makers, and warming drawers, combined with a pergola or roof for shade and shelter, and layered lighting like \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/outdoor-lighting\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eoutdoor chandeliers, sconces, and moveable lanterns\u003c/a\u003e. Also, the warmth of a fireplace or discreet heaters will let you stretch the season well into sweater weather.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, design features that take a cue from the outdoor setting and embrace “the natural world” are ideal, says Kurc, who favors \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/trellis-ideas\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etrellises\u003c/a\u003e draped with \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/indoor-climbing-vines\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eclimbing\u003c/a\u003e hydrangeas, herb gardens, and oversized planters to anchor and define spaces. It’s the special touches that mean the most to the people who use that space that truly make it feel complete, like a wood-burning pizza oven or a tabletop s’mores maker.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The goal is to make it feel curated yet effortless so you linger a little longer,” she adds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAre there any must-have components of an outdoor kitchen?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to important components of a functional and enjoyable outdoor kitchen, Donaldson recommends people focus on a few major features. First up is the grilling and cooking station, since it’s essential to understand how the homeowner prefers to cook when selecting an appliance. Next is the countertops, which provide adequate workspace and a surface that needs to hold up to the elements, including salt air in many circumstances. Next is the sink, since having water access for cooking and cleanup is efficient and convenient. “No one wants to take dripping food containers or dirty utensils back through the house,” Donaldson adds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile lighting is often overlooked, it increases the usability of an outdoor kitchen and also provides an element of safety. Also, shade and cover protect from the sun and rain, and allow the space to be used more frequently. “After all, cooking outdoors and dining al fresco during a summer rain shower can be a lovely experience!” Donaldson concludes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat are the best materials to use for an outdoor kitchen?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Stainless steel is very durable and easy to clean,” says Lowney. “It withstands moisture and heat and holds up well to the outdoor elements.” When it comes to the countertops, Lowney suggests granite because of its strength and durability with minimal maintenance. “With a strong commercial sealer, it will resist staining and moisture. Porcelain is also becoming popular due its ease of maintenance and attractive price point,” she adds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow much does it cost to build an outdoor kitchen?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCertainly, building a full-size outdoor kitchen with a prep area, stainless-steel appliances, and a kegerator is a pricey option. Lowney says that it’s “really difficult to put a number on” outdoor kitchens, since “cost can vary greatly depending on the design, size, labor required, and materials you use.” However, many people choose to DIY their own outdoor kitchen, working to plan and build the space with a strict budget. Remember, even a humble mini fridge next to a wisely designed counter space can be the foundation of your outdoor kitchen design. When you’re dining al fresco, having your own outdoor kitchen can be enjoyable with just a pair of comfortable \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/26-bar-stools-ad100-architects-and-designers-love\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebar stools\u003c/a\u003e at a high-top table.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDoes adding an outdoor kitchen increase the value of your home?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause an outdoor kitchen expands the usable space of your home and enhances the property’s overall appeal, it will ultimately increase the value of your home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e“This is particularly true in areas with favorable climates, as they offer opportunities for relaxed entertaining and cooking while connecting with nature, which is a lifestyle goal for many homebuyers,” says Donaldson. However, she also notes that the extent to which an outdoor kitchen impacts a home\u0026#39;s value can vary depending on factors such as the quality of construction, design, and local real estate market conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow do you keep costs down when building an outdoor kitchen?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re looking to expand your outdoor space, Donaldson recommends sticking to a budget that prioritizes which features are most important to you. Since weather-resistant products can often be more costly than their interior counterparts, consider practical, yet lower-cost materials to use such as concrete, stainless steel, or composite material for cabinetry. “It is best to keep it simple in an outdoor kitchen, eliminating the aesthetic bells and whistles, if budget is a concern,” Donaldson added. Consider the outdoor elements as your design inspiration and aesthetic and let the cooking station be just that, functional, and practical, but not too showy. As for where you shouldn’t attempt to save money, Donaldson recommends that people never cut corners when it comes to safety features. “High-quality materials, proper ventilation, and professional installation protect against fire or gas leaks,” she adds. Additionally, waterproofing measures will contribute to the longevity of the outdoor kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat do I do about my outdoor patio kitchen during the winter?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are so many variables that go into designing an outdoor entertainment space, with one of the most important ones being the environment you live in. Folks who live in dry areas with little precipitation don’t have to worry as much about the threat of snow or hurricanes. By building a covered patio kitchen, you aren’t as limited to when you can use the space. Lowney, who based in New England, recommends building a covered kitchen area to ensure it lasts longer. “It extends the longevity of the investment,” she notes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBelow, browse a range of backyard kitchen ideas to get you started on your outdoor kitchen journey.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
