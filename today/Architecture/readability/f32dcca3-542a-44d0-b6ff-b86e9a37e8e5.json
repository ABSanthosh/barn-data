Silvery olive trees and Mediterranean pines defy the sirocco winds near Il Tabacchificio (“the Tobacco Factory”), a building with a simple and square profile boasts an interesting history and a luxurious present. First built in the 1930s, it once employed about a hundred people, mostly women. At the time, the province of Lecce produced a quarter of Italy’s tobacco, and this operation was one of the most important in the region.Designed in the 1930s, this building in Puglia was once an important tobacco factory that employed about 100 people, mostly women. In the postwar period, part of Tabacchificio was used to store food until the 1960s, when it was converted into small metal and frame factory. After years of neglect, the current owners, who purchased it in 2014, decided to renovate it while preserving its original character. The work, which lasted four years, was entrusted to Raffaele Centonze, an architect who describes himself as a “storyteller of spaces.” He enhanced the building’s original features and made it one of the most popular locations in the region for both Italian and international travelers.After years of neglect, the current owners, who bought the building in 2014, decided to renovate it while preserving its original character. The work, which lasted four years, was entrusted to Raffaele Centonze, “a storyteller of spaces” who was able to enhance the original features. In the dining area, the table is by Marina Home Interiors and it is surrounded by Tulip chairs by Eero Saarinen (Knoll) and Panton chairs from Vitra. The entrance to Tabacchificio, where three pieces from Gaetano Pesce’s famous UP series stand out: the foot (right, foreground), the red armchair (in the rear of the photo) and the ball pouf, all from B\u0026B Italia. The industrial hanging lamps are Naviglio by Boffi. Sustainability played a key role in the renovation, with Centonze using reclaimed materials like vintage doors and other period elements. The main entrance leads to an open space with vaulted ceilings, white walls, and polished concrete floors that reflect the room’s natural light. The front door aligns with one at the room’s rear, helping the space feel more open. Glass and iron elements accentuate the building’s industrial, rationalist soul. What was once a place of intense labor has now become dedicated to relaxation.The pool area of Tabacchificio. The facility is located just minutes from Castro Marina. One of the suites at Tabacchificio. Each has a different design style. In the foreground, a Flos Viscontea hanging lamp with metal frame and a fabric shade by Castiglioni. All the collectibles, placed as if they were part of an installation, are mixed together with a nod to the wabi-sabi aesthetic, a Japanese design approach that celebrates the interplay between beauty and simplicity, as well as embodying the essence of austerity and tranquility. After a long day at the beach or spent lounging by the pool after a round of tennis, the elegant and minimalist suites are intimate and welcoming retreats. The spacious living room, reading nooks with favorites novels and volumes of poetry, the large kitchen and outdoor gazebos all exude the atmosphere of an Italian piazza—this is a place for gathering together, socializing, and enjoying the finer things in life. The living area, centered around a fireplace, includes an eclectic mix of contemporary design and industrial details. All the collectibles, placed as if they were part of an installation, are mixed together in deference to a wabi-sabi aesthetic that celebrates the interplay between beauty and simplicity, as well as embodying the essence of austerity and tranquility.The elegant and minimalist rooms offer an intimate and cozy retreat after a day in the sun. The reimagined tobacco factory has room for up to 16 people in its six bedrooms, each with its own, distinctive design. One bedroom has a four-poster bed, bathtub, and a private bathroom with a walk-in shower. Two suites are distinguished by having either a sculptural bathtub or two four-poster double beds. Two other double rooms offer direct access to the garden and a mezzanine area. A long corridor connects the sleeping area to the living area, a play area, and a screening room.One bedroom features a four-poster bed and sculptural bathtub. The entrance area is dotted with important design pieces. The kitchen, with its French doors opening onto a garden, gives direct access to the outdoors. The screening room and office offer space for working vacations in a tranquil setting. Overarching everything is the peace and inspiration the property and its flawless décor hold.In one of the bedrooms: the ceiling lamps are Splügen Bräu by Castiglioni (Flos). One of the bathrooms. The floor lamp on the right is Hebi Snake by Artemide. One aspect of Tabacchificio that makes the place unforgettable is the pervasive quiet and calm. This enchanted structure that once resounded with the voices of people cleaning, drying, and sorting tobacco leaves is now remarkably peaceful. The 36 vaults of the interior, tall and spacious, make the old building a rural landmark with eccentric and evocative spaces, where white predominates over every other color. The façade, aged by sunlight and wind, speaks to the timeless quality of the architecture. It’s a building with a century-long history that is far from over and instead has now embarked on a new chapter.The pervasive quiet and calm is a standout feature of the property. It is an enchanted place that once resounded with commotion and productivity.",
