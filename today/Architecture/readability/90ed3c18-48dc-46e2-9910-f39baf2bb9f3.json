Also, Hayden Panettierre’s childhood home lists, and a new wellness-geared residential development is announced. In this roundup, AD PRO has everything you need to know.In the NewsThe real estate industry reacts to support Los Angeles wildfire victimsIn the wake of the horrific wildfires across LA County, residents who’ve lost their homes have been scrambling to find a new place to live. Locals are faced with the strenuous task of finding housing alongside hundreds of other victims. While price gouging has been reported, there have been numerous real estate professionals stepping up to help too.Jason Oppenheim of the Oppenheim Group, a brokerage made famous by the Netflix reality show Selling Sunset, announced that he and the other agents at the Oppenheim Group would represent those who lost their houses in the fires for free. “I woke up this morning to a lot of friends and clients reaching out because they lost their homes over the last couple of days,” Oppenheim said in a Reel on Instagram posted January 9. “The Oppenheimer Group is offering to represent anybody for free, or we will credit you back any commission you paid if you lost your house and are now displaced.”Timer Fridman of the Fridman Group and Juliette Hohnen of Douglas Elliman spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about their efforts. Both said that they’re getting creative about opening up inventory by getting in touch with clients with second and third homes to see if they’re open to renting to those in need. “I’m suggesting, ‘Why don’t you go and live in your house in Palm Springs? Or why don’t you go to Palm Beach? Why don’t you do three months in Europe?’” Hohnen told the Hollywood Reporter. “I’ll rent it.”Meanwhile, the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles (AAGLA) has created a centralized list of available rental properties. They’ve called upon property owners and managers with spaces available for rent to share information on unit availability so that they can be added to the running list. “As rental housing providers, we have an absolute obligation and duty to assist fire victims with finding a place to live,” Matthew Williams, president of the board of directors of AAGLA said in a statement shared by Pasadena Now. “We must do whatever we can to match wildfire victims with available housing.”To learn more about how you can help with the LA wildfires, visit our comprehensive guide.New ListingsHayden Panettierre’s childhood home in Sneden’s Landing, New York, lists for $3.995 millionThe house is located at 129 Washington Spring Road. Photo: Ian Alexander NelsonLocated less than half an hour from Manhattan, the town of Sneden’s Landing, New York, is known for its celebrity appeal. It’s fitting, then, that Hayden Panetierre, who’s been full-time acting since she was five years old, grew up there. The actor’s childhood home recently hit the market for $3.995 million.With its mansard roof and ivy cover, the home appears like something out of a storybook from the exterior. Inside, though, the four-bedroom, four-bathroom home is quite contemporary-looking, save for some vintage decorative flourishes, like the grand chandeliers and valence curtains that appear in a few different rooms. The kitchen, with its waterfall marble island, stainless-steel appliances, and recessed lighting is all modern, as are the new marble bathrooms. Downstairs, a rec room features built-in storage and a wet bar.A landscape designer created a number of distinct outdoor spaces on the nearly one acre parcel of land, including stone patios, water features, and a koi pond. Richard Ellis of Ellis Sotheby’s International Realty holds the listing.A sculptural beauty in central California asks $5.6 millionThe ranch is located at 19623 Road 211, Friant, CA.Photo: Andrew BramascoLocated in Friant, California, a small town outside of Fresno, this property offers complete immersion in nature. Totalling approximately 700 acres, the estate comprises three sprawling land parcels, the showpiece of which is a home designed by architect Gene Zellmer in 1989.With terra-cotta tile floors, sculpted white stucco walls, and wood-beamed ceilings, the three-bedroom, three-bathroom home feels tranquil and expressive without becoming a distraction. Well-placed windows frame the views of the surrounding terrain. The open living space includes an elevated seating area surrounding the fireplace—a space that almost feels like a conversation pit in reverse, but with the same intimacy. Expansive terraces and an infinity pool perched near a pergola offer numerous places from which to view the gorgeous rolling hills and trees nearby.Elsewhere on the property, there are two additional homes—a four-bedroom, two-bathroom option and a two-bedroom, one-bathroom residence. There’s also a 2,420-square-foot barn, a chicken coop, horse and cattle pens, and a garden. Sarah Hedrick holds the listing.Asking $14 million, a new town house in The 74The 74 condominium is located at 201 E 74th St, between 74th and 3rd in New York City. Photography Courtesy of Elad GroupFor those who want the convenient amenities of a luxury tower with the sprawl of a single-family dwelling, a town house affiliated with a condo building can be the ideal fit. This newly listed town house on the Upper East Side is located around the block from The 74, but still offers the same design prowess and amenities of its sister building.The four-bedroom, four-and-a-half bathroom residence was designed by Craig Copeland of Pelli Clarke \u0026 Partners, marking the firm’s first-ever town house design. Stained ash wood cabinetry and millwork provides a serene, Scandinavian-style living environment. Numerous outdoor spaces are available for homeowners, including a rear garden with a grill station, multiple smaller terraces, and a rooftop terrace large enough for a fire pit and outdoor dining area.“With The 74 town house, we had a rare opportunity to design a ground-up residence on New York’s Upper East Side, drawing inspiration from the neighborhood’s rich architectural history. Through the design process, we aimed to cultivate a visual dialogue with the neighborhood by drawing inspiration from the qualities of Manhattan Deco,” Craig Copeland, Partner, Pelli Clarke \u0026 Partners, told AD PRO by email. “The result is a bold, sculpted facade crafted from pleated white terra-cotta and red sandstone, which echoes the architectural language of the surrounding buildings.”Douglas Elliman Development Marketing is handling sales for The 74.New DevelopmentsThe Well announces its second residential real estate projectThe Well Coconut Grove is set to be located at 2855 Tigertail Ave, Miami. Rendering Courtesy of The Well Coconut GroveWith the concurrent ascendancy of self care and branded residences, it’s only natural that the two would crossover. In 2023, New York wellness destination The Well announced its first residential real estate project, developed with Terra and located on the Bay Harbor Islands in Miami. Now The Well and Terra are announcing their second collaboration: the Well Coconut Grove.Units will span one- to four-bedrooms, starting at 960 square feet and reaching up to 4,200 square feet. All residents will have access to a range of niche wellness amenities, including hyperbaric chambers, crystal cave relaxation lounges, and other highlights that move beyond the typical “sauna and cold plunge” offerings at the average luxury condo.“We really value the partnership we've found with Terra,” says Kane Sarhan, cofounder and chief creative officer of The Well. “Now, in bringing The Well to Coconut Grove, we have an opportunity to build a truly unique community where people can live their happiest, healthiest lives.”Prices start at $1.5 million.
