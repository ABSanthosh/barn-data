This is Billionaire’s Row, home to some of the world’s most expensive real estate, the Russian Tea Room, and Bergdorf Goodman. Now, guests can check into one of this strip’s most ultra luxurious new stays and be the only guests sleeping on Park Hyatt’s top floor, to the nightly tune of $50,000.In honor of the flagship’s 10-year anniversary, the hotel paid a sum of $10 million to transform its spa into the hotel’s largest and most expensive suite. Appointed with three bedrooms, three full bathrooms, two powder rooms, and two 140-square-foot balconies overlooking Central Park, The Manhattan Suite immerses its residents in the city, while offering a sanctuary on the 25th floor.A view of the dining room, with room for eight to ten guests.

We want it to feel like a real New York City apartment,” Vincent de Croock, the Director of Sales and Marketing at Park Hyatt New York, tells AD. At 3,500-hundred-square feet, the Manhattan Suite is well over the size of the average American home and comes with its own concierge.Upon entering, guests are welcomed by the sunny living and dining rooms, framed by 18-foot floor-to-ceiling windows, showcasing the cinematic cityscape. The interiors, helmed by New York–based studio Sawyer \u0026 Company, are an ode to understated sophistication and refined minimalism. “Designed as an elevated interpretation of New York residential living, [the suite] reflects the city’s effortless blend of bold character and refined elegance,” says Tracey Sawyer, founder and CEO of Sawyer \u0026 Company. “Subtle nods to the skyline’s architectural lines and textures are paired with rich, tactile materials, and carefully curated art and design.”Inside the primary bedroom.

A muted color palette, such as the blush-colored Vladimir Kagan sofas, softens the modern interiors and geometric light fixtures. A contemporary art collection—including works by Grace Watts, Erin Shirreff, and Erin O’Keefe—invite playful pops of color into this L-shaped suite.A peek into the living room.

The Manhattan Suite also comes fully equipped with a $500,000 sound system and a 165-inch Sharp TV anchoring the living room area. The king-size Bryte Beds—dressed with Sferra linens—use multisensory AI to encourage better sleep and help travelers kick jet lag. Each bathroom features heated Bianco Piove travertine floors.Included in the stay—which requires a two-night minimum—are custom, embroidered pillowcases and robes, a personally stocked Molteni kitchen equipped with Miele appliances, mini bars sourced from Brazil, as well as a 24/7 personal concierge. “For the Manhattan Suite, we opted not to do a butler. What a butler does is different in the Middle East to Australia to the United States,” de Croock explains. “Luxury is personal.”Guests can enjoy their own personal office.
