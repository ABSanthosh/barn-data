  "text": "Every morning in Doha, just before dawn, a cluster of mechanized speakers rise from the base of one especially extraordinary minaret—a column seemingly afloat, supported by a system of cables and wrapped in lattice. Upon reaching the top, the audio equipment plays a live or recorded call to prayer before descending to its resting position. That sequence repeats four more times throughout the day as Muslim women gather at Al-Mujadilah, a new mosque, library, and education center designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro.Wrapped in lattice, the freestanding minaret features mechanized speakers that ascend to issue calls to prayer. Photo: Iwan Baan/Courtesy of DS+RFounded by Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, chairperson of the nonprofit Qatar Foundation, the building is being heralded as a contemporary first of its kind: a purpose-built mosque exclusively for women. Located on Doha’s Education City campus, it serves not only as a place of observance but as a forum for learning. (Al-Mujadilah refers to a woman in dialogue.) “I founded Al-Mujadilah to nurture the next generation of Muslim women to seek the answers to contemporary challenges from within the vast knowledge contained in our religion,” says Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser. “I wanted it to be a place of beauty and tranquility that would facilitate learning and contemplation.”Its design more than meets that mandate, blending abstraction and tradition to achieve a place that is both awe-inspiring and inviting. For Diller Scofidio + Renfro, the project marked not only its first mosque but also its first spiritual space of any faith. Well acquainted with iconic mosques of the past, but admittedly unfamiliar with many Muslim practices, firm partner Elizabeth Diller and her team immersed themselves in Islamic architecture. What historic precedents had in common, they discovered, was an ineffable eloquence, with an expressive scale and sublime light (in addition to hallmarks such as the mihrab and minbar). “A place of worship is the kind of space that we had to imagine emotionally and intellectually,” Diller reflects. “The challenge was to translate that into a sense of spirituality.”Clad in Travertine, the prayer hall’s undulating qibla wall frames the mihrab and minbar; the carpeting is based on an enlarged scan of an individual Prayer rug. Photo: Iwan Baan/Courtesy of DS+RThe solution came in the form of an undulating roof, which swoops up above the prayer hall and down over the education center. “The roof allows there to be grandeur and intimacy in one gesture,” Diller says of the adjoining spaces, whose shared volume shifts 17 degrees off axis from the canopy in the direction of Mecca. The prayer hall’s orienting qibla wall, clad in travertine, bears its own curves. One niche frames the mihrab, cupping natural light from the aperture above to create a luminous focal point. (Historically the mihrab, indicating the direction of Mecca, would have been the most richly ornamented element, often bearing mosaic tilework.) The other, inverted, contains the minbar, a steel cantilevered platform lit from below, where the imam delivers sermons.A diffuse glow permeates the entire space as a result of 5,488 conical light wells, each one just 7.8 inches in diameter along the roofline—minimizing solar gain—but flared out at ceiling height to appear much wider. All cast a radiant aura upon the carpeting, its pixelated pattern based on a blown-up scan of a single prayer rug. “Our intent was to create something familiar but not quite,” Diller says of the plush pile, woven in China out of wool from New Zealand, with depressions to indicate rows for prayer. No individual mats necessary.At every turn, meanwhile, the design fosters a deeper connection to nature—from the gardens that surround the building to the circular interior courtyard that separates the prayer hall and education spaces, planted with two olive trees (symbols of knowledge). Materials reinforce that bond, especially the complementary use of travertine and black limba wood, whose palette echoes the tones of sand. The ablution area, by contrast, features washing stations of dark basalt.The interior courtyard that separates the prayer hall from the education spaces is planted with two olive trees, symbols of knowledge.Photo: Iwan Baan/Courtesy of DS+RSince quietly opening to the public in January 2024, the project has steadily developed and expanded its mission, which encompasses research, programming, and partnerships, all geared toward guiding women on the path toward religious and intellectual confidence. “A lot of women are looking for spaces where they can come together and have meaningful conversations,” says Sohaira Siddiqui, Al-Mujadilah’s executive director and a professor of Islamic studies and theology at Georgetown University in Qatar. “The goal was to create someplace specifically for women, rooted in local traditions and cultures, that would also resonate with the whole world.” This past January, in keeping with that goal, Al-Mujadilah hosted a global summit dedicated to the evolving role of Muslim women in public life.The significance of the building has not been lost on Diller, who heralds Al-Mujadilah as a “breakthrough,” noting, “women feel at home here as a place of intellectual exchange. Hopefully it will set an example.” In the meantime, the project continues to inspire women, who can be found visiting morning to night, when those speakers make their final ascent of the day up the freestanding minaret, casting kaleidoscopic shadows below. Of the light show, admits Diller: “We didn’t anticipate that. It just happened.”This new mosque in Qatar is featured in AD’s March issue.
