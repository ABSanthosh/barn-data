What do you see? If you’ve followed AD PRO’s reporting on color trends, or checked in on the wellness amenities, AD100-approved retro designs, or in-demand layouts covered in AD PRO’s member-exclusive 2025 Interior Design Forecast, you probably have some idea. (Hint: Tactile and natural materials like terra-cotta and rattan aren’t going anywhere.),Still, the projects that will shine in in 2025 will have been in the works for a few years at least, meaning that what appears to have snapped into focus at the stroke of midnight in the New Year is actually more of a slow-motion zeitgeist. A constellation of textures, colors, fabric patterns, overlooked moments in design history, and new obsessions have all been brewing like coffee (or indeed, setting up in the fridge like Mocha Mousse) for a few years now, and in the coming months, we’ll see it all come to fruition. For a sneak peek, we asked the experts for their predictions and hopes for 2025. Here are the decor ideas they’ll be embracing in the coming year.A primary bedroom of a Hampstead family pied-à-terre by De Rosee Sa leans into the softer, earthy palette that many experts expect will predominate in 2025. Earth tones2025’s color palette is like a visit to the produce aisle: The earthy colors of fruits and vegetables will abound next year, from the vivid yellow of a spaghetti squash to the soft brown of a coconut husk. Pantone’s 2025 Color of the Year, Mocha Mousse, sits somewhere between brownish pink and pinkish brown, making it a sophisticated choice for a multitude of elements, whether your tastes skew toward minimalism or maximalism. We predict seeing it—or at least an organic, earth-toned cousin of it—everywhere from paneling to wall coverings, carpets, upholstery, and paint. “I think we will see people choose warmer and deeper colors [in 2025],” says New York–based AD100 designer Young Huh. “Brown and all of its surrounding shades are back with a vengeance.”Fellow AD100 honoree Lauren Geremia sees a move toward gentler hues more generally: “Something I am feeling these days is a softer approach to color,” she says. “We have been creating a lot of spaces lately with palettes toned down to a warm dusky glow that is more livable and enduring.” UK-based Christian Bense loops burgundy into this moody palette. “Burgundy provides the unexpected pop of color you’re after, in a more sophisticated, grown-up way. It elevates a space without shouting in the same way a red might,” he says. Beet red, you’re here to stay—so bring on the bordeaux-adjacent paint colors, textiles, and accessories.Curveball furnitureA living space designed by AD100 alumna Lauren Geremia boasts curved wood furniture—a hot item for the new year. Laure JolietLive edges and rounded corners on wood furniture will have us partying like it’s 1979, as will “puffball” seating in cozy, luxurious fabrics. “We are using a lot of curvilinear furniture shapes and lots and lots of layers,” says Huh. For a town house in Notting Hill, Banda sourced a vintage Sesann sofa by Gianfranco Frattini for Cassina. Why? “This Notting Hill town house is defined by a bold, masculine palette of cool tones, clean lines, and contemporary forms,” says founder Edo Mapelli Mozzi. To give this steely space softness and dimension, the team upholstered the sofa in a violet velvet mohair from Dedar’s Adamo \u0026 Eva collection and let its silhouette do the rest. “Its sculptural, cloud-like form is both bold and inviting, with a tubular metal frame that enhances its architectural presence,” Mapelli Mozzi adds.A London residence by Vabel makes good use of Ligne Roset’s Togo sofa—a model that cofounder Jeremy Spender praises for its versatility. Courtesy of VabelFor Jeremy Spender, the cofounder of UK-based firm Vabel, a certain yielding plushness “makes the contemporary comfortable,” he says, citing the example of Michel Ducaroy’s timeless Togo sofa—what he calls “puffball seating.” “This statement sofa has a striking sculptural form which works beautifully in open plan spaces, where typically you see a sofa from all angles; the rectilinear design with soft organic finish transcends beyond the functional and in turn acts as a focal piece for any room. Solid craftsmanship and modularity also means that these “puffy” pieces “can work in any shape or size of room,” he adds. Chicness and physical well-being need not be enemies.Early modernismChairs by the English Arts and Crafts architect John Campbell flank a dining table in a stylish Long Island home designed by Hadley Wiggins. Photo: Pernille Loof / Styling: Michael ReynoldsThe exquisitely subtle colors, sumptuous silhouettes, and geometric clarion calls of the very earliest modernists are back: Arts and Crafts, Art Nouveau, and work by Wiener Werkstätte are catching the eyes of seasoned and new collectors alike. The embrace of these aesthetics in home design seems of a piece with the move toward muted colors and curvy furniture. New York City–based AD100 designer Ryan Lawson notes that the generative potential of these movements doesn’t stop at furniture—it’s a more large-scale source of inspiration for him. “I’ve always referenced the early modernists, from Charles Rennie Mackintosh to the Bauhaus to Wiener Werkstätte, but I’m particularly looking back at their color combinations,” he says. Back then, he notes, experimentation was in the air. Huh echoes this, citing Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau design styles making a comeback.Why the buzz? “Arts and Crafts furniture is film vernacular for ‘cozy’ and ‘this movie takes place in California,’” says Meaghan Roddy, West Coast director at Volume Gallery. “We are all into our nostalgia,” she says, noting how “Art Nouveau reminds us of the lamp in our grandmother’s house that was fancy and beautiful and obviously an important heirloom.”That ability to tap into not-so-distant history helps explain the appeal of designs from just over a century ago, says Michael Diaz-Griffith, director and CEO of the Design Leadership Network and author of The New Antiquarians. “Art Nouveau, the Wiener Werkstätte, and the Arts and Crafts movement are seeing an uptick in popularity because our algorithm-trained eyes yearn for aesthetic novelty, our world-weary souls crave romance, and we are hungry for fresh (if historic!) perspectives on craft, the ultimate design obsession of the 2020s,” he tells AD PRO. “These styles speak to that zeitgeist, and thanks to the internet, we have ready access to them: The most obscure, previously unappreciated (or forgotten) designs are always just a click away.” It’s about time, he adds: Modernism is far more diverse than the Bauhaus derivatives that have flooded the market in recent years. “That perspective is tired and limiting,” he says. “I love that curious people are embracing the weird, romantic, nature-inspired, handcrafted depths of modern design and plumbing them for inspiration.”Immersive interiorsIn 2025, expect to see all-in looks—whether through engulfing color or floor-to-ceiling art (as seen here in the Manhattan home of James LaForce and Stephen Henderson, designed by AD100 debut Ryan Lawson). Photo: Stephen Kent Johnson / Styling: Colin King / Art: Elvin Rodriquez, Mark Beard, Bradley Narduzzi, Guno Park, Peter Harvey, Andrew KennedMixing patterns from across history and the globe, plus a vogue for “head-to-toe” color (rather than judicious “pops” of bold colors as focal points), are allowing designers to craft distinctive and unique living spaces with a strong point of view. And homeowners, it appears, are more and more onboard. “I think there’s been a good shift lately of color usage that's more sophisticated,” says Lawson. “I think we will see a continued bend toward more-saturated colors used in more ‘full-immersion’ ways.”Ed O’Donnell, creative director and cofounder of London-based firm Angel O’Donnell, doesn’t hesitate to give advice on this topic: “Pick a color you like and liberally apply it,” he says. “It’s a swift, smart way to give a room character.” His studio likes to color drench using mineral-rich paints for their sustainability and durability. That way, “if you choose to see red, green, or acid yellow everywhere you turn, you’ll always see the very best version of it,” he says.This allover look doesn’t stop at color. Decking out dining rooms, bedrooms, or other living spaces in single-species florals—or even going all-in on material drenching in the bathroom by applying the same marble to floors, walls, and countertops, even lighting fixtures—can be equally chic. (On that note, the minimalist reign of Calacatta may be coming to an end as designers and clients alike pounce on vivid, unusually-hued marbles. Hear hear!)Real personalityRayman Boozer of Apartment48 has long embraced big personality in interiors—such as in this colorful, layered bedroom he designed. Courtesy of Apartment48Perhaps it’s a rebellion against the infinite reach of algorithmic marketing, or a certain righteous fed-up-ness with the monotony of corporate hospitality, but uniqueness itself appears to be having a moment as one of the interior design trends for 2025. “I hope to see more rooms with personality,” says Rayman Boozer, founder of New York City–based studio Apartment 48. “We should be mixing patterns and colors to tell stories about the people who live in the spaces we design.”Gloria Steinem’s New York City apartment Photo: William Abranowicz / Styling: Mieke ten Have“I think there is more beauty in interiors that are authentic, and in a world of AI, it is nice for home to feel warm and personal,” says Geremia. “We hope to see more of that authenticity in 2025—real photos of real people, authentic styling, and a unique, personal perspective.” Case in point: Gloria Steinem’s textile-filled town house from AD’s January issue. It features everything from vintage metal kitchen cabinetry to nooks full of museum-worthy artifacts from the Women’s Liberation Movement; in the living room, a box of cassette tapes is shown sitting on designer Pierre Yovanovitch’s “Gloria” chair—it’s a portrait of Steinem, complete with trademark eyeglasses, in furniture form. The tapes were photographed exactly as found.Huseyin Bicak, a senior interior designer at London-based Charlton Brown says this approach marks a movement toward home design trends that make residences feel more personal and storied. “There has been a shift in interior design towards spaces that feel curated and layered, as opposed to overly styled and staged, picture-perfect interiors,” he tells AD PRO. “People are embracing a more personalized approach, blending inherited pieces, antiques, and new furniture to create environments that feel authentic and meaningful.”Lawson believes unique elements are the signposts of a point of view and a personal story—indeed, we all have them, regardless of where home decor trends are inspiring us to go. “Maybe it's not exactly a trend, but I do think that there is a general movement away from sameness,” he says. “I am encouraged by that. I push my clients—and my friends and anyone else who will listen—to seek out things with backstories to give their houses a specific point-of-view. I push them to make choices that differentiate their houses from their friends' houses, to not buy the things that other people buy.”Looking for even more intel on design in 2025?
