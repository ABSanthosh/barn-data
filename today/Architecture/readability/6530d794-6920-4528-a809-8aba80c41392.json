  "text": "Despite the name of the show that gave this LA pad its claim to fame, it’d be more apt to say everybody wants this: the home from Nobody Wants This, Netflix’s hit rom-com starring Kristen Bell and Adam Brody, has landed on the market for just under $3.8 million. Designed by David Lucido, the four-bedroom and four-bathroom dwelling where Bell’s character, Joanne, records her dating podcast, is a serenely updated spot with tons of character.Cream-colored walls and rosy terra-cotta floors unite the majority of the house’s 3,776 square feet. The warm neutrals are interspersed with occasional swaths of sophisticated color—some aubergine-hued cabinets here, a staircase lined with hand-painted mustard tiles there—making for a calm canvas with plenty of personality for its next inhabitant to build on. The main double-height living area features a wall with built-in bookshelves, while a smaller sitting room nearby is warmed by a fireplace and a contrast ceiling sporting a latte-like shade of brown.There are no upper cabinets weighing down the spacious kitchen, which upholds the abode’s tranquil philosophy by editing down any extra visual clutter. An island with open shelving on the side provides some additional storage to display dishware. In the corner, a wavy built-in banquette is situated next to a walk-in pantry; on the opposite end, a built-in bar segues into a cozy alcove where one could imagine sipping an aperitivo (or hanging out with Adam Brody). In the backyard, an angular swimming pool is bordered by a skylit guesthouse, where said guests could theoretically stay if they have one aperitivo too many.Join NowBecome an AD PRO member for only $25 $20 per month + receive an exclusive toteArrowThe listing is held by Marc Noah of Sotheby’s International Realty – Beverly Hills Brokerage.",
