    "description": "At the outset of the design process, the young couple, both working remotely from home, approached the project with a refreshingly open mindset. Rather than bringing a predetermined vision or detailed brief, they entrusted the design team with a blank canvas, allowing ideas to emerge organically through conversation and shared imagination. Their only clear desire was for the house to serve as a holistic space: a place that supports both their daily work routines and their evolving lifestyle as a growing family.",

    "description": "In Peru, 93% of urban growth is self-produced (Espinoza, 2022), occurring progressively over long periods of execution and waiting. In this context, architecture is almost always too expensive, too slow, especially when it involves the recovery of unconventional construction knowledge, where adequate access to specialized labor represents high costs due to limited access to technical knowledge.",
