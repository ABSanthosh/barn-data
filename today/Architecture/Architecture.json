    "description": "Curved Attic is the renovation project of a unique property in the centre of Valencia with privileged views over the old Turia riverbed. The architecture of the building itself, with a circular envelope, allows these views to extend along the house, being a characteristic of such strength that it gives its name to the project and around which the main idea of the project is developed. From a first approach to the project, the intention was to clear the interior of the house to allow views of the outside from almost every point. This involved placing the most used areas (day zone, kitchen and master bedroom) attached to the façade, as well as demolishing an overbuilt mezzanine that compressed the living area, leaving it now with a double height that underlines the sloping roof of the building.",
