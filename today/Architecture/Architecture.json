    "description": "This renovation project reimagines a 60-square-meter apartment by maximizing visual and spatial fluidity while carefully designing light and shadow to enhance depth, openness, and a three-dimensional spatial experience. Despite its compact footprint, the apartment unfolds with a richness of perception and movement, orchestrated through shifting sightlines, varied floor levels, and nuanced material transitions. The generous ceiling height and a private roof terrace serve as key spatial assets, enabling a layout that encourages both fluid circulation and moments of calm, shared intimacy.",

Pressure from investors, for whom a large and distinctive building is to their liking, not infrequently results in oversized buildings. In the case of Apartamenty Bałtycki, the overriding goal of the project was to dialogue with both the architecture of the characteristic pre-war villas of Swinoujscie and the landscape of the coastal dune where the development was located.",

Designed for weekends away with his wife Ana Carolina and their three children, the home is both a restful hideaway and a bold experiment in modular, eco-conscious design. The result? A prefabricated house that feels anything but prefabricated, joyful, fluid, and in sync with nature.",
