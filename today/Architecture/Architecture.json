The serene atmosphere of the Buddhist cemetery on the northern slope extends across the ridge, blending into the quiet residential streets to the south.

The design proposal aims to contextualise the proposed Block A in its suburban setting by incorporating familiar domestic archetypes of the front porch and the verandah into circulation spaces and thresholds. The majority of the spaces are consolidated under a single roof which pitches north and south in deference to the neighbourhood street and to avoid overshadowing existing hardcourt play areas.",
