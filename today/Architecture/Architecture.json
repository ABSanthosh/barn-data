These \"land shelves\" span across the site in the east-west direction making them an ideal platform for a house that takes advantage of both solar and wind orientation.",

    "description": "The Vila Romana Triplex was a very special project inspired by design, art, culture and games. To achieve the final result with a contemporary design, the 250m² apartment features modern solutions such as the integration of environments, a swimming pool with a glass edge, a staircase and a mezzanine that is hollowed out in a slender metalwork design. On the other hand, it was a very challenging process, as the apartment is in an old building where the implementation of the solutions required a series of adaptations. Sectoring the 3 floors of the project, on the first floor, in the Social Hall, we have a first reference (there are many) to Brasilia with a painting we made with tiles by Athos Bulcão. Entering the apartment through the Social Entrance, we have the Dining Room, Kitchen and Laundry and the corridor to the bedrooms. The idea was to integrate the dining room and kitchen through a cobogó wall that also brings natural light into the corridor leading to the intimate areas. The client's dream was to have a pink kitchen. So, we used the same pink finishes for the kitchen and laundry room, which are also integrated, but with the challenge of not making them look childish, we counterbalanced the pink of the cabinets and the ceramic tiles with a Portuguese design (a link to their other house) on the floor with the graphite color of the countertop veneer, details of the freijó joinery and the cladding above the countertop in blue. n the dining room, the organic tabletop designed by us follows the design of the room, allowing for fluid circulation around the space and the wooden floor brings the warmth of natural materials into the room. This room also features wall art by the artist Dani Shirozono, a close friend of the couple.",
