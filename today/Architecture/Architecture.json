The atmosphere of Pacoche varies between foggy and rainy days and sunny days, providing a diverse and enriching experience for those seeking a deep connection with nature.",

    "description": "Our guiding principle, following the clients' request, was to design a single-story, comfortable home. To achieve this, the house's layout was distributed horizontally along the middle portion of a sloped site. The design followed a T-shaped plan, placing the social spaces along the lower longitudinal axis of the lot, while the private wing, which houses the bedrooms, extended in the opposite direction. The private wing was positioned between the main entrance to the residence and the outdoor leisure area, designed to be enjoyed by both the social and intimate spaces. Connecting the two areas, wide corridors were enriched by winter gardens, offering a pleasant transition throughout the house.",
