    "description": "Casa Gruta, located in the Sisal neighborhood of Valladolid, Yucatán, is an architectural project designed by architects Salvador Román Hernández and Adela Mortera Villarreal. This space aims to explore perception, scale, and materiality through a plastic and architectural approach that evokes the sensation of a refuge, reminiscent of a cave. The work invites reflection on the fleeting nature of time and the relationship between the ephemeral and the eternal through the use of light and shadow, and the interaction between new structures and pre-existing ones.",
