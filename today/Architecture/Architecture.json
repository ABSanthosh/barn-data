Once carried by river merchants and deeply rooted in the everyday life of the Mekong Delta, these ceramic pieces have now become the soul of the Earthenware House. In this modest house, we integrate Lái Thiêu ceramics into both the architecture and interior design, so that each touch of a doorknob or step on the ground evokes the exuberance and authenticity of the land to which the house belongs.",
