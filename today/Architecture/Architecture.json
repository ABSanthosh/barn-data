    "description": "Rarely does one get a chance to redesign a house that has a recent memory of its past owners. More reason for the son to keep the homage alive and for us to do justice to redesigning while keeping the essence alive. The conservationists within us felt a nudge. Adaptive reuse and conservation were the two keywords that came to us instinctively. The questions that arose and the ones we attempted to answer thereby: How do we familiarise new into the existing structure while keeping its character alive? How do we bring elements such as a greenhouse, a pool, an entrance porch, and a semi-open verandah to enhance the experience? How do we make it our own?",

    "description": "The Red Cedar Lake residence is a modern architectural home fused with the natural landscape. Departing from the traditional aesthetics of the clients Cass Gilbert-designed Saint Paul home, they envisioned a contemporary, open-concept cabin harmonizing with nature. The selected site, abundant in wild beauty, offered expansive lake views and secluded inlets. The design concept divided the land into two zones: a meticulously landscaped area surrounding the house and the untouched remainder left in its natural state.",
