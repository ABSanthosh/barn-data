Typically used as roofing material in tropical climates with high humidity, these tiles have been creatively repurposed as a building facade, enclosing the entire ground floor of the dining area. Spanning 1100m¬≤ over 2 floors, it is part of Bumi Kayom, a pioneering contemporary F\u0026B complex in Salatiga. The building's bold appearance accommodates a fusion of Eastern and Western culinary traditions, offering an alternative dining atmosphere in this town of 200.000 people.",

Located on a rural plot in the countryside of S√£o Paulo, the house was conceived as a sensitive response to the surrounding natural context. Set on an extensive site with a pronounced slope, the residence engages in dialogue with the uneven topography and celebrates the mountainous landscape in the background, incorporating the presence of nature as a fundamental element of its architectural composition.",
