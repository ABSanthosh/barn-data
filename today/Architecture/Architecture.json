This pool not only serves as a visual anchor but also creates a serene and reflective space, enhancing the home's connection with landscape. The layout encourages a seamless indoor-outdoor flow, where the house and the landscape blur into one cohesive environment. Approach to the residence is carefully orchestrated across a series of staggered floating walls, which both conceal and reveal the house as one moves through the drop off space. These walls, along with well-considered landscaping, provide a buffer between the driveway and the more intimate areas of the home.",
