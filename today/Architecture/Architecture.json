The goal was to create a house that would fulfil the client requirements of a guest house while unfolding into something that would bring the users imagination alive. House of Dancing Cactus is a two-storey building conceptualised by the usage of bricks – a locally available material in Pondicherry - and seeks to mimic the waves of the sea of this coastal town.",

Positioned on a rocky slope overlooking Göcek Island, the house offers a seamless connection to nature while maintaining a low-impact footprint. The initial site visit took place on a rainy January day, setting the tone for the project's deep engagement with the landscape. The terrain, shaped by thousands of years of rainwater erosion, consists of limestone rock formations, olive trees, and a dense natural cover. The project sought to respect and preserve this unique ecosystem while designing a functional, comfortable, and aesthetically refined living space.",
