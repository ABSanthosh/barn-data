    "description": "Paying homage to Collingwood's industrial past, House of Fortune by Dean Dyson Architects, restores heritage while embracing innovation and social connection. Stepping into Dean Dyson's studio, the clients described wistful reminiscing of Collingwood's industrial past and shared childhood memories of neighbourly engagement and social connection. These stories inspired Dyson, as lead architect, to weave cherished memories into the very soul of the home.  Stepping beyond functionality, the design incorporated \"nostalgic feelings\" through layout and material choices. The brief to Dean Dyson Architects centred upon values of family connection and adaptation.",
