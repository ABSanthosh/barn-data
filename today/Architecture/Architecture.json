This article introduces the \"Machikado\" project consisting of six houses in Asahi-cho, Kagamigahara City, Japan. The roads there become gardens, and the gardens of each house are connected to each other, making the whole area look like a park.",

    "description": "Surrounded by a large suspended planter in dialogue with the garden, Floreira House reflects nature in a countryside condominium. Privacy, minimalism, and the demand for low maintenance were the driving forces behind the creation of a residence designed for gatherings of friends and family in a condominium in the town of Porto Feliz, in the countryside of São Paulo. To bring these characteristics to life, Matheus Farah e Manoel Maia Arquitetura designed a large garden at the rear of the 3,182 sqm lot, toward which all other areas are oriented, serving as the heart of the project. On the upper floor, elongated metal planters encircle the entire external area, softening the transition between materials and creating a dialogue with the garden. The prominent presence of this element justifies the name Floreira House (House of Planters).",
