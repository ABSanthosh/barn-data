This 315 m² project transforms a house in ruins into a residence that blends tranquility, contemporary design, and a deep connection to nature. Designed as a second home for a family from Mexico City, the house is a tribute to the owner's small daughters, who dreamt of their pink house. Through this design, Tapia honors the family bond while preserving the original character of the building, including its original pink façade.",

    "description": "The buildings emerged in response to a public initiative project for the construction of kindergartens in various areas in Lisbon, through a competition launched by the Municipality. The starting point was a standardized solution that allowed for economic intervention, quick execution, and the creation of an identifiable image, making these facilities recognizable throughout the city. The proposal is based on the overlapping of structural modules in reinforced concrete, with a “U” section, shaping the building's surfaces. The choice of this material is linked not only to the modular configuration but also to the requirement evident in the competition program to ensure solutions of high and proven durability and low maintenance.",
