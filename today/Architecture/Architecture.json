    "description": "El Perdido spiritual space draws inspiration from the foundational rustic chapels of the Baja California peninsula. This Ramadas initially built with natural and ephemeral materials served to carry out the first religious ceremonies in the seventeenth century. The plan of the spiritual space is oriented towards the east as a symbol of communion between the different beliefs of the ancient traditional civilizations. Having the historical missions of the Baja California peninsula in the background, El Perdido spiritual space mediates between the exterior and the interior patio, bringing together inmates and the community. Analogically with the religious spaces of the missions that mediated between the exterior and the cloister, the spiritual space is part of the perimeter wall and the most public space of the complex.",

    "description": "The owners of this house, with a beautiful view of the lake and the forest in Quinta da Baroneza, have always been fans of the work of the Gilda Meirelles Architecture office. When they found a ready-made residence that had been tailored for another resident who needed to move, they fell in love at first sight. Over time, the large family began visiting the house more frequently—on weekends, holidays, and during vacations—and realized they needed more space to comfortably accommodate everyone, including for entertaining occasional guests. Thus, they acquired additional neighboring lots, totaling an area of 1,300 m².",
