    "description": "A home for a couple, nestled in the heart of the city – Situated in a densely populated residential area, the north-facing property stands quietly amid the urban fabric, enclosed on three sides by neighboring properties. Created with spatial limits both in plan and cross-section in mind, the design embraces vertical continuity, creating a fluid and expansive living space.",

    "description": "The Casas Boêmia are semi-detached homes born from the idea that a small house can also provide a comfortable space for family and friends to gather. Since these homes are built on a half-lot—measuring 5 x 25 meters—we focused on enhancing common areas. With a total built area of 85m², we managed to create a spacious living room integrated with the dining area and kitchen. We opted to include a single parking space, which allowed for the creation of a wooden deck with an outdoor barbecue area. The key feature of the project was placing the barbecue adjacent to the kitchen counter, separated by a sliding door that disappears into the side of the structure, eliminating the need for duplicate sinks and freezers.",
