Two townhouses in a row facing the tunnel alley were renovated and reborn as an acupuncture clinic. The two buildings in tandem have an extremely long and narrow space with a frontage of 3.5m and a depth of 21m. In order to use this efficiently, we set diagonal axes for the two townhouses and arranged functions along them.",

Through its recessed glass, the observer contemplates the surroundings, and as they wander, they traverse long patios that connect the interior and exterior simultaneously. On a 12x30 meter plot, with setback requirements and the dream of a construction that encompasses the clientâ€™s entire program of needs, we faced a challenge that transformed into a production of meanings, textures, and studies.",
