The architectural layout is carefully adapted to the steep terrain, with a series of interconnected functional volumes stacked along the slope. Each volume is carefully oriented to capture the best views and create a sense of openness across the property. The design not only responds to the land's topography but also emphasizes a fluid connection between the indoor and outdoor spaces, ensuring that each section of the villa feels integrated into the landscape.",

The local context is highlighted to establish a strong identity while adding a distinctly contemporary touch, reflective of our time. As a nod to traditional architecture, we have used local materials such as Travertine marble-volubilis, crowned with geometric patterns inspired by Moroccan heritage, as well as perforated panels reminiscent of \"moucharabiehs.\" The traditional motifs of these panels adorn the façades of the project, giving it an identity inspired by southern Morocco.",
