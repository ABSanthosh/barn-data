Conceived as both a family residence and an architectural studio, the project is shaped by decades of coastal living and a deep sensitivity to the rhythms of the Australian bush. From its use of reclaimed materials to its elevated design that treads lightly on regenerating land, this residence is an exemplar of responsive, climate-conscious architecture.",

Designed by GLA Architects, the 1,300? resort unfolds gently along a stream, surrounded by mature metasequoias and dense bamboo. Rather than reshaping the landscape, the design treats the forest as the lead character, inviting guests to enter a living, breathing ecosystem through subtle architecture.",
