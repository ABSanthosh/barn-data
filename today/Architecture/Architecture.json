Stern Architects (RAMSA) has designed a new flagship home for the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University's Capitol Campus in downtown Washington, D.C. The new 150,0000 sqft building, located at 125 E St. NW, is an academic hub for students, faculty, researchers, and the wider policymaking community active in the nation's capital. The building houses extensive educational and community spaces, including 20 classrooms, an expansive main commons, academic offices, a 400-seat auditorium, and a large rooftop terrace with sweeping views of the U.S. Capitol and a 280-seat venue. As an academic center devoted to addressing complex national and international challenges, the McCourt School of Public Policy prioritizes sustainability and energy efficiency and is designed to achieve LEED Platinum certification. Additionally, a series of original site-specific installations by architect, designer, artist, and sculptor Maya Lin encourage building users to consider their natural surroundings.",
