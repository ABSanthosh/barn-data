    "description": "\"Baan Meesook\" is designed based on simplicity, warmth, and living in harmony with nature in mind. The building emphasizes the connection with natural light, wind, and trees to create a relaxing and comfortable atmosphere for the residents. The house is arranged in an L-shape to create a private courtyard area surrounded by the building, allowing the residents to experience nature at every corner of the house. The front of the house facing west is designed to be solid to prevent heat and increase privacy. However, when entering the house, you will find an open space connected to the courtyard, creating an atmosphere that is clearly different from the outside.",
