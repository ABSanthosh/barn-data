Villa 144 is situated near Bushehr, a city in southwestern Iran along the Persian Gulf, characterized by a hot and humid climate. The residential architecture of old Bushehr, shaped mainly during the 18th and 19th centuries, features unique traits such as narrow, labyrinthine alleyways, making it one of the most expressive and unconventional narrations of Iran's traditional residential architecture.",

    "description": "Situated on a corner city lot within the context of traditional Edwardian gable homes in Toronto's High Park neighborhood, the Westminster residence is a 2,340sf 3-bedroom primary home for a family of 4. The project aims to provide an underlying sense of familiarity and continuity within the archetypal roof form of the context, creating a paradoxical balance between blending in and standing out. Hidden within a steep, weathered terracotta roof, the project explores the notion of spatially occupying the underside of the roof, akin to an attic.",
