The facility has been built to enhance earthquake-preparedness measures and develop practical seismic isolation systems in Japan, one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries. With its capability to evaluate the performance of seismic isolation devices, E-Isolation provides an open space where structural researchers, designers, general contractors, manufacturers, building owners, and others can get together. This project has been implemented as a collaboration among industry, academia, and government in order to strengthen Japan's resilience to earthquakes.",

    "description": "Tucked into a five-acre wooded site just outside Seattle, Washington, the Interurban Residence is a quietly bold family home designed by Heliotrope Architects. Created for a family of four, this home turns its back on urban hustle and instead reaches deep into the forest, embracing sun, air, and natural materials with equal parts elegance and restraint. With interiors crafted by Amy Baker Interior Design and a landscape thoughtfully composed by Land Morphology, Interurban feels not simply placed within the forest, but deeply rooted in it.",
