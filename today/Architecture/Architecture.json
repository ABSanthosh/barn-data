According to the 2016 census by the Iranian Statistics Center, its population was 750. The project for constructing a school in Ja'farabad was brought to us when the village had only two schools for elementary and first-year secondary education. One of these schools, which housed the first three grades, was old and had poor spatial quality. Consequently, with the donation of a plot of land by the city council adjacent to the elementary school, it was decided to design and construct a school for the first cycle of secondary education.",
