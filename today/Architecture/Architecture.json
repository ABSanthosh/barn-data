    "description": "When a young family with three children moved into a mid-century modern bungalow on the edge of a North York ravine, they were excited about the house's natural surroundings and its modernist style. However, the house was ill-suited for the contemporary family's needs. Its interior was cramped, dark, and disorderly, and it lacked connection to its surroundings. They hired Denegri Bessai Studio (DB Studio) to improve the house's functionality and experience while preserving and enhancing the best of its modernist bones.",

    "description": "Since 2013, the City of Munich has been operating a nationally unique overnight shelter for homeless men, women, and children, initially housed temporarily in a building of the former Bayern Barracks. With the completion of a new facility in Schwabing-Freimann offering 730 places, both the standards and range of services have been significantly enhanced. Those seeking shelter are no longer accommodated in rooms with eight to twelve people but rather in rooms with four beds. What's more, the facility's purpose has evolved from merely providing overnight accommodation to offering comprehensive support, including dedicated spaces for counseling, medical treatment, and a daytime gathering area.",
