    "description": "A 70m2 apartment in the City of Buenos Aires, designed to house a typical traditional family, has been inhabited for several years by a young woman who lives and works in it. Does it make sense to maintain compartmentalized spaces without cross ventilation when the activities carried out in each of these are often the same? Working from bed with a laptop, napping in an armchair, writing in the kitchen. Does an apartment with a bathroom and a toilet for one person make sense? Two rooms? A door between the kitchen and the laundry room? Another to close the bedroom?",
