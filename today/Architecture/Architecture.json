    "description": "In the lush, green landscape of Kottayam, this residential project seamlessly blends traditional Kerala architecture with contemporary design elements, offering a unique and refreshing approach to residential living. At first glance, the residence appears to be a typical Kerala-style home, with the layout surrounding a central courtyard and its pitched tile roofs. However, a closer look reveals a unique approach to spatial design that challenges conventional norms. It's a quintessential Kerala house layout – rooms surrounding a central courtyard – and quite literally \"exploded\" it.",

The vital objective of the Greeks was to achieve a state of mind that allowed them to live calmly, and thus they discarded any negative feelings that worried them and kept them from that spiritual goal. Ataraxia seeks tranquility and inner serenity, peace of mind. The residence is located in Querétaro, Mexico, and has 450m2 of construction distributed over 2 levels.",
