The site is in the northeast of the Sint-Pieters-Leeuw municipality, in the industrial district of Ruisbroek. The design consists of two primary structures: a production hall and a publicly accessible office building. The office building features a large brewing and event hall, complemented by supporting facilities such as kitchens, storage areas, shops, offices and conference rooms, as well as a spacious, partially covered terrace designed for social events. In a future phase there are plans to expand the storage and production hall at the back of the site.",
