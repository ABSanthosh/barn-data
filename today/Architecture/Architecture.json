This project represents the museum's biggest physical leap since its installation in the iconic Avenida Paulista headquarters in 1968, designed by Lina Bo Bardi. The METRO Arquitetos Associados firm — led by Martin Corullon and Gustavo Cedroni — is responsible for the architectural design. This collaboration continues the longstanding relationship between METRO and MASP, which began in 2015 and has already resulted in significant interventions in the original building, such as the return of the glass easels, redesigned from the museum's original exhibition system.",
