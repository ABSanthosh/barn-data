    "description": "Surrounded by a dense forest in Rio de Janeiro's Atlantic Forest, this summer retreat opens out to the sea of Angra dos Reis and some of its 365 islands in the archipelago, considered one of the most beautiful coastlines in the world. It was in this region that, decades ago, Paulo Jacobsen began working with wooden structures. Initially motivated by the easiness in which this material could be transported through coastal waters, wood is nowadays one of the major design hallmarks of his practice. Therefore, it is amidst this abundant nature that the AEA House lightly touches the ground and incorporates the topography. Respecting the location of a previously existing house, this project sought to use natural elements that could create an architectural space in tune with the surroundings.",
