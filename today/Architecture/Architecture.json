    "description": "A room without an inhabitant. The term nLDK is widely used in the Japanese residential real estate market, where n stands for the number of bedrooms, L for the Living room, D for the Dining room and K for the Kitchen. For example, if a flat has two bedrooms, it would be described as a 2LDK. The description nLDK is very important for real estate market information, as people generally search for a room based on the number of n that is appropriate for their family size and income. For example, a couple with one child will often be looking for a floor plan with n≥2. The seller would then consider that at least 2LDK is necessary in an area where there are many families with children. This nLDK typology has emerged in the history of post-war housing supply, but its rigidity has been criticized in recent years.",

Positioned at the southeast corner of the intersection of Pudong Avenue and Dongfang Road, it resides in a significant urban node to the east of Lujiazui CBD's core area. To the east, between the Wind Tower and Qiancang Road, was the site of the historic Wu's Residence (Wu Miaosheng's Residence), a Heritage Architecture in Shanghai built in 1924. Adjacent to the south is the Chen's Residence, built in the 1930s, designated as a Cultural Relics Protection Site in Pudong.",

With an area of 1528 ft², the space integrates a living room, kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. The journey through the environment is transformed into a cozy sensory space, where the project's proposal is dedicated to the contemplation of stillness. The proposal suggests something different by making the presence of silence almost palpable.",

More than just a passageway, this space creates a real living space for fine weather and a belvedere offering uninterrupted views of Mont Aiguille in the distance, as well as the jagged rocks formed by the 'Dolomites du Trièves' just above.",

The Baugruppe system, German for \"building group,\" proposes an alternative approach to housing that allows groups of individuals to come together to design and construct their residential spaces, bypassing traditional developers to create personalized and sustainable living environments.",

    "description": "Canada's climate is known for its dramatic contrasts, ranging from frigid winters to hot summers. Large metropolitan areas such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver experience a variety of extreme weather conditions: heavy snowfall, ice storms, and freezing temperatures are common. In some cases, temperatures can plummet to below -30 degrees Celsius, especially in cities like Montreal or Quebec. In turn, this weather creates certain challenges for architects and engineers when designing with certain materials. In this context, brick remains a popular construction material not only because of its relatively low thermal conductivity, making it a good insulator during the winter but also because of its connection to the country's architectural heritage.",

    "description": "Barragán, Bofill, Graves, and Le Corbusier are architects renowned for their exceptional and sensitive use of color. In their approaches, color takes on an importance comparable almost to functionality, achieved through a nuanced and comprehensive perception of their context. But what is color? From a technical standpoint, it is a visual perception that arises from the interaction of light with our eyes and brain. However, when we explore its meaning on a more emotional and poetic level, it takes on a deeper significance. For Ricardo Bofill, color infuses life into architecture, while for Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, —better known as Le Corbusier—, it serves as a powerful tool to evoke emotions and create spatial illusions.",

From a physical point of view, we encountered a lot of low-quality constructed buildings in the city of \"Ilam\" with minimal semi-open spaces. Our critical approach to the typical low-quality apartments in the city, with nearly \"100 percent\" lot coverage without any livable space, led us to make this project as a platform for the realization of the idea of extensive and active semi-open spaces using the concept of \"Spatial Border\". Therefore, the design process began with this question: How can we take the advantages of the \"corrosive grid\" to address a \"Spatial Border\" in order to resolve the contextual issues?",
