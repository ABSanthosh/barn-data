    "title": "My Favorite Volumizing Mascara Is on Major Sale Right Now",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/it-cosmetics-superhero-mascara-review-49329307",
    "description": "I've been a fan of IT Cosmetics for as long as I can remember. I first fell in love with the brand after trying its beloved CC+ Cream, which remains one of my favorites to this day. This pattern has become familiar over the years: each time I test any of its latest releases, I find myself consistently impressed. Among the standout products that followed the CC+ Cream is the Superhero Mascara ($16, originally $28). As a beauty editor constantly sampling the latest offerings to stay up to date with the best products of the year, I've tried too many mascaras to count. To this day, to this day Superhero continues to be one of my tried-and-true favorites. What makes it so good? Ahead, I break down everything you need to know about it before adding it to your cart. (Which, by the way, is currently on sale for Amazon Prime Day.) Keep reading for my full review. About the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara first launched in 2016, and the waterproof version followed in 2023. It's formulated and designed to lengthen and add volume to your lashes. It's infused with collagen, biotin, proteins, and peptides to condition lashes while enhancing their appearance. What I Love About the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara What I love about the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara is how well it enhances the volume and length of my super-straight lashes without clumping them together. Before applying any mascara, I use my Tweezerman eyelash curler. Without it, I've noticed that mascara tends to weigh down my lashes, counteracting my goal to add volume. In the below photo, you'll see my left eye in its natural state (without having used an eyelash curler) and the right eye prepped without mascara, just freshly curled. (The difference is jarring, I know.) How to Use the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara Applying IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara is straightforward. I start by curling my lashes, then use the mascara wand to sweep and wiggle the product from root to tip. Two coats usually do the trick, and I'm good for the entire day. This mascara is my go-to for no-makeup-makeup looks, ideal when I want natural makeup but lashes that really pop. For days when I have an afternoon workout planned, I opt for the waterproof version ($28), which effortlessly withstands sweat and - when my CorePower Sculpt classes really take a toll - tears. Below is a photo of how my lashes look after freshly applying the Superhero Mascara. It's night and day from the lifeless lashes I started with. (And yes, they really stay like that until it's time to whip out the makeup remover.) What to Consider Before Trying the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara It's important to be aware that some users of IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara have reported clumping, as noted in the reviews. My tip is to remember that less is more with this product, as the formula is quite thick. I recommend prepping your lashes for application by combing them and removing any excess product from the mascara wand before use. If you see a glob of mascara on the wand, gently wipe it off on a tissue to ensure a smoother application. Although these additional steps might seem inconvenient, it's worth noting that not all users, including myself, have dealt with clumping. Another thing worth noting? The IT Cosmetics Superhero also comes in a travel-size version ($17), if you're interested in giving it a test run before investing in the full-size tube. Who Is the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara Best For? IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara is best for those like me who want to level up their lashes with volume and length. It's a great option for all ages, given that it's infused with collagen, biotin, and peptides that condition your lashes as you coat them. While choosing a mascara is highly subjective, in my opinion, this one is worth experimenting with at least once. It might be a game-changer for you, as it was for me. Where Is the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara Available? IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara is available direct-to-consumer via the brand's website, Sephora, Ulta Beauty, and on Amazon.

    "title": "\"Unsexy\" Beauty Products PS Editors Can’t Live Without",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/unsexy-beauty-products-49362561",
    "description": "There's a new trend sweeping Beauty TikTok where users reveal the \"unsexy\" beauty products in their routines that work like a charm. From body oils to tongue scrapers and everything in between, people are raiding their bathroom shelves to talk about all of the items they swear by but wouldn't necessarily take a shelfie of. These items are effective and get the job done - they just don't have the cutest packaging or Instagrammable results. As editors, we get to try products that run the gamut from dirt cheap to extremely expensive. Due to the nature of our roles, it's our duty to try everything with a neutral lens and report back on whether they work. While we love aesthetically pleasing bottles and pretty formulas that make us want to snap a picture, sometimes the best products are the ones that just work – sans any other bells and whistles. What's \"unsexy\" about a product can mean different things to different people. For some, it's the packaging that it comes in; for others, it can be what the item is used for. Still, the unifying quality of all of these items is that they deliver incredible results regardless of all that. As such, we've decided to share our favorite unsexy beauty products that we can't live without and would recommend in a heartbeat. Our obsessions range from products like Aquaphor Healing Ointment to First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - there are truly all kinds of options. The best news? A bunch of these products are currently on sale for Amazon's October Prime day, so make sure you stock up while you still can. From deodorant to dandruff shampoo, keep reading for the items we always keep in stock (and hidden within our medicine cabinets).",

    "title": "The Viral Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask Is a Whopping 30% Off Right Now",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/laneige-lip-sleeping-mask-review-48879903",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy Very few cult-favorite beauty products have brought me as much joy as the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask ($17, originally $24). Ever since laying my hands on a little tub of it for the first time years ago, it's remained a staple on my bedside table, in my handbag, and on my work desk, just to name a few spots I have them stashed. (Yes, I proudly own several flavors.) I'm obsessed with everything about this lip mask, from its pretty pink packaging to its hydrating, nonsticky texture. The lip mask is available in classic flavors like Berry and Vanilla, but occasionally, Laneige throws a limited-edition one into the mix. They unveiled Pink Lemonade Swirl in May 2022 (and fans are begging for its return now that it's unavailable). With a reputation as one of the best lip masks on the market, the product has become a viral sensation - PS editors love it, beauty influencers love it, and the hydrating product even boasts a few celebrity fans. Charli XCX called it one of her everyday essentials in an interview with British GQ - perfect for brat summer and beyond - and Ashley Park named it her sleeping must have in an interview with PS. As you might guess, I wasted no time in getting my hands on these tubs, and I can confidently say that they have become new staples in my everyday routine. The good news? If you're interested in testing it out for yourself, you can now score select flavors of the buzzy product for a whopping 30 percent off during Amazon's October Prime Day sale. Stock up while you still can and read on for my full Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask review. About the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask The formula first made its debut in the US in 2015 with its bestselling flavor, Berry. Before introducing seasonal flavors like Watermelon Pop and Mango, the brand had a lineup of four other options: the original Berry, Sweet Candy, Vanilla, and Gummy Bear. Each mask is formulated with hydrating hyaluronic acid, moisture-locking glycerin, and skin-protecting antioxidants. What I Like About the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy I've always been the type of person who reaches for fruity scents over the sweet ones, and Pink Lemonade Swirl and Mango were just as delectably summery as I had hoped. The Mango flavor captures the fruit's smell perfectly and the Pink Lemonade Swirl is like sipping on a refreshing glass of the real deal. (I know this sounds annoyingly cliché, but I'm telling it like it is - I swear.) As for what it looks and feels like: it's a lusciously thick formula with a silky-soft texture and a glossy finish. I agree with our former content director, Macy Cate Williams, who reviewed the original Berry formula and said: \"This lip mask isn't sticky or uncomfortable - it glides on smoothly and feels very soothing on my lips.\" Like her, I'm also a fan of using it instead of a regular lip balm throughout the day. The tiniest amount goes a long way, so even with multiple applications daily, it lasts a while. What to Consider Before Buying Laneige Lip Sleeping Masks When considering Laneige's lip sleeping masks, one important factor to keep in mind is the cost. At $24, this balm comes with a higher price tag, and it's worth noting that there are comparable products available at a lower cost. However, the masks' sleek and visually appealing packaging, which has gained significant attention on TikTok with over 250 million views (!) for videos tagged with #laneigelipmask, likely contributes to their premium price point. It ultimately comes down to personal preference and budget when deciding whether the investment is worthwhile. While I don't make it a habit to purchase these on a regular basis, I do treat myself to one occasionally as a special indulgence - and I urge you to do so, too. Where Are Laneige's New Lip Sleeping Masks Available? Laneige's new Lip Sleeping Masks are available direct-to-consumer from the brand's website, as well as at Amazon and Sephora.

    "title": "These Editor-Loved Acne Patches Shrink Pimples Overnight - and They're on Sale",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/hero-cosmetics-mighty-patch-original-review-49316247",
    "description": "I've been fortunate enough to have relatively clear skin for most of my life, but every now and then, there are those pesky pimples that pop up at the most random and unwanted times. Sometimes, it can be due to stress or simply a sign that a change in my skin-care routine is needed. Either way, I typically try to get rid of them as fast as possible with a spot treatment. However, recently, I've been even more successful at eliminating breakouts with the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch The Original ($16, originally $22). As someone with sensitive skin, I'm not the first to jump at just any new product. But that doesn't mean I'm not tempted by the idea of something that promises to get rid of acne in just a few hours. After finally giving the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch a chance, I was thrilled to learn that my easily irritated skin loves it. It helped eliminate my pimples overnight. Keep reading for my full review of the acne patch (which, by the way, happens to be on sale for Amazon Prime Day, which started Oct. 8). About the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch The Original Made of pure, medical-grade hydrocolloid, this sticker improves the look of pimples overnight. It's a chemical-free formula and allergy-tested to be suitable for all skin types. You typically see results in six to eight hours. The sheet's translucent matte finish blends well into the skin. Included in a box are 36 patches. What I Like About the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch The Original From its unmatched staying power to the undeniable results, I can say that the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch truly lives up to the hype. Thanks to its gel formula, the patch gently clings to the skin for hours while effortlessly absorbing all of the gunk in the pimple. This is great, whether you're a heavy sleeper or on the go all day. It also helps you beat the annoying temptation of picking at your face, which helps prevent scabs and scarring caused by popping pimples. The patches come in 36-count and 72-count packages. How to Use the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch The Original The Mighty Patch is incredibly simple to use. Whether you're going to sleep or just starting your day, prep your skin with your usual cleansing routine. You can apply toner as well, but be careful with your moisturizer as the area around the pimple needs to be dry and any oils will keep it from adhering properly. Then, you just stick the patch on, let it sit for six to eight hours, and peel it off when it turns white. And just like that, you're left with a noticeably smaller breakout and in some cases, it fully disappears. What to Consider Before Trying the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch The Original This acne patch is an excellent option for all skin types, including those with sensitive skin like myself. However, the brand recommends using caution if you're prone to irritation. Where Is the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch Original Available? The Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch Original is available on Amazon, as well as Target, Ulta Beauty, and the brand's website.

    "title": "I Stopped Using Dry Shampoo After Trying This TikTok-Viral Product - Now 30% Off",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/color-wow-raise-root-spray-review-49060256",
    "description": "I don't care what anyone says, TikTok is a treasure. Over the years, the app has introduced me to new ways to wear my hair in a claw clip, a blush makeup hack that made my life infinitely easier, and new relationship advice. What more could someone want? I'm constantly scrolling for beauty tips, especially when it comes to my hair. I have fine hair, and it can look exceptionally flat at the roots when it's dirty. Plus, I only wash it twice a week, so it's actually dirty more often than it's clean. When I saw a video from TikTok user Kaelyn Emily showcasing how a root-thickening spray gave her dirty hair new life, I knew I had to test it out for myself. So, does the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray ($17, originally $24) live up to the hype? Spoiler alert: it does, and it's worth hitting the \"add to cart button,\" especially while it's currently on sale during Amazon's October Prime Day. Keep scrolling to read my full review and see before and after photos. About the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray This liquid formula is made with proprietary elastomers that promise to add volume to the roots of the hair. It can be applied wet or dry and works for all hair types, but it's ideal for thin, fine, or limp hair. It also doubles as a heat protectant, and it's paraben, sulfate, and gluten-free. @kaetheblondie Wait whatttttttt #hairstylistlife #hairstylistsoftiktok #volume #hairtok #flathair #hairhack #hairtips ♬ original sound - Kae What I Like About the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray I've used this product quite a few times since my first trial, and it's become one of my go-to tools for giving my hair volume. Now that I know it works well on dirty and dry hair, it's practically replaced my need for dry shampoo entirely. I've also used it on damp, clean hair, and it's my favorite product for making sure my volume lasts all night long. It doesn't leave behind any stickiness, and there's no visible residue that I often see when using dry shampoos. How to Use the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray The brand recommends applying the product to damp or dry hair, concentrating on the roots, and then styling as desired. In the video I saw on TikTok, the woman applied the product to dirty hair, which is how I initially decided to test it out. I was on day four of not washing, so I wasn't entirely sure whether or not it would work for me as well as it had for her. To try it out, I started out by sectioning off the top of my hair and spraying a generous amount of the product in each section. Then, I took my Dyson Airwrap dryer attachment and soaked up some of the excess product. From there, I took the Dyson round brush attachment and began blowdrying and styling. When I was finished getting everything smooth and dry, I was shocked to see that my hair not only had tons of volume at the roots but also looked like it had been freshly washed. What to Consider Before Trying the ColorWow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray One thing to note about this product is that, unlike dry shampoo, it does require the extra step of styling with a blow dryer or dryer brush. If you're someone who likes a quick fix, this might not be the product for you. However, I think the extra step is worth it based on the results. Also, I have noticed that the product can smell a little bit like alcohol when you first apply it, and although it quickly fades, it can be a little off-putting at first. Where Is the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray Available? The Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray is available on Amazon, as well as the brand's website and Sephora.

    "title": "Hair Extensions 101: Everything You Should Know From Experts",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/hair-extensions-48959472",
    "description": "Whether you have thin hair that you're looking to bulk up, short hair that you want to lengthen, or are just in the mood to switch up your hairstyle without the commitment of a more permanent change, hair extensions are a great choice. The topic of hair extensions is vast and complex. There are a variety of different types of hair extensions - like hand-tied extensions, microlinks hair extensions, tape-in extensions, clip-in hair extensions, and halo hair extensions, to name just a few - and each kind has its own list of perks and drawbacks. Aside from the cost, you'll also want to know how to properly care for your hair extensions and how long they'll last before committing. If you're considering trying hair extensions for thin hair for the first time, we're sharing everything you need to know so you can find the best hair extensions for your needs with the help of four experts below. They help us break down the cost of hair extensions as well as all of the different types. Keep scrolling to learn more. Experts Featured in This Article Louise Bailey is the founder of Hair Extensions London. Julia Venturin is a hair-extension expert at Luxy Hair. Tatiana Karelina is the owner of Russian hair-extensions company Tatiana Karelina. Brynn Reed is the lead extension specialist at Mirror Mirror Salon. Types of Hair Extensions \"There are many different hair types and application methods available, so you can experiment until you find the perfect look for you at a price point that suits your budget,\" Louise Bailey, founder of Hair Extensions London, tells PS. Before we get into the different application types, let's go over the two main categories of hair extensions: real human hair extensions and synthetic hair extensions. \"Human hair extensions are exactly what they sound like - they are made out of real, human hair from top to bottom, collected from a donor,\" says Julia Venturin, a hair-extension expert at Luxy Hair. \"Remy hair means all the cuticles (the outer layer of the hair) are intact, running in the same direction at the time of collection. This allows for almost no tangling and ensures that the extensions remain smooth and silky throughout their lifetime.\" Synthetic hair extensions, on the other hand, are made out of various synthetic, blended fibers - no human hair. \"These fibers are usually very fine, plastic fibers that are manufactured to imitate real human hair,\" Venturin says. Here, we're breaking down a few of the most common types of extensions. Clip-In Hair Extensions View this post on Instagram A post shared by KnappyHair by Keandra Janelle (@knappyhair) Clip-ins are perhaps the easiest, least time-consuming way of adding length, thickness, and volume to your hair, and one of the best things about them is that you don't even have to see a professional to have them installed. \"The good, quality clip-ins will look and feel natural, they will last years, there is no commitment, and you can fit and style them yourself,\" says Tatiana Karelina, owner of Russian hair-extensions company Tatiana Karelina. These types of extensions clip to your hair, and they come in handy when you want to change up your hair for a particular event or occurrence and don't want to commit to something more permanent. (You typically take them out after a day but can continue to reuse them for long after that.) Nowadays, clip-ins come in all kinds of lengths, textures, and colors, and you can usually buy them in packs. For an editor-approved option, read our full review of Bellami hair extensions; the brand has plenty of weft hair extension options. Tape-In Hair Extensions View this post on Instagram A post shared by Extensionaire Luxury Hair Extensions (@extensionaire) Tape-ins are considered semipermanent extensions; they're similar to clip-ins except that they can last longer and are taped to your hair. They're also pretty weightless, so you don't feel weighed down even if you're wearing a head full of them. \"Tape-ins are applied by a professional and can last for two months before needing maintenance,\" says Bailey. \"The hair is reusable with this method.\" Microlink Hair Extensions View this post on Instagram A post shared by Microlinks | TapeIns | ClipIns (@perfectdistractionhairgallery) Microlinks - also called microrings or microbeads - are a popular alternative option to sew-in weaves and tape-in extensions. These are normally attached to strands of hair using small tubes or rings, and they are said to be safer than other kinds of extensions because they don't damage the hair and scalp by putting too much weight or stress on them. They also don't require the use of glue or adhesive, making them a lot less noticeable in your hair. One downside, depending on how you look at it, is that getting a full head of microlink hair extensions can take anywhere from one to five hours to complete, but they can last up to two to three months. Sew-In Weaves View this post on Instagram A post shared by Taniyah 🤍 (@taniyahslayedyoullc) Installing a weave is a process that requires a bit more labor. They're usually installed by a hairstylist who braids the hair down into a specific pattern - either what's known as a beehive or straight-back cornrows - before sewing bundles or \"tracks\" down to the braids. This can usually take anywhere from two to six hours, depending on how many bundles you're installing (two or three is a good amount) and how speedy your stylist is. Weaves can last anywhere from six to 10 weeks, though it's important for people who wear them to also make sure they're still regularly taking care of their hair that's beneath the weave. Keratin Bond/Pre-Bonded Hair Extensions View this post on Instagram A post shared by Great Lengths Hair Extensions (@greatlengthsusa) Keratin extensions are also known as k-tip extensions. Bonds are fused to the hair using keratin and a heat gun. This process can take a few hours to complete since, like microlinks, each extension is connected to your natural hair individually until the desired look has been achieved. These aren't permanent, but they do last up to four or five months, depending on personal maintenance. UV Hair Extensions @lachunsoftlife #hairloss #alopecia #fyp #hairextensions #atlantahairstylist #onthisday #coldfusionhairextensions #softlife ♬ original sound - Luxury extensions LED or UV hair extensions are touted as the most seamless extension technique to date. To get the look, single strands of hair will be bonded onto your natural pieces of hair, using a special glue that will then be cured with a UV light to keep everything in place. How long the process takes depends on how large the area that you're working with is, and the results last for about six weeks. The cost is usually about $250 per session and approximately $1200 for your entire head. Halo Hair Extensions If you're looking for a quick and easy way to add length to your hair, you might want to consider Halo hair extensions. The extensions use a thin wire to secure the hair around the crown of your head, and your natural hair goes over it. They're easy to put on and take out, which makes them perfect if you want to add a little extra length and thickness for a special event. There are a few different brands that make this type of hair extension, like Zala Hair Extensions and Luxy. Read our full Luxy Halo Hair Extensions review. Do Hair Extensions Damage Your Natural Hair? Sadly, there's a lot of misinformation out there about hair extensions, including that they will damage your natural hair. In fact, this notion is mostly false. Bailey explains that when applied by a professional and cared for properly, damage is not likely. \"If you're considering getting hair extensions, it's important to do your research and consult with a hair-extensions expert to ensure that they're right for you and the correct hair type and product is used,\" she says. How to Care For Hair Extensions Hair extensions require special care. The better you care for them, the more use you'll get out of them. The number-one rule of handling hair extensions is to be gentle. \"Brush them gently with a soft-bristled brush, and avoid using harsh chemicals or too much heat,\" says Bailey. Venturin adds: \"The more you wash and heat style your extensions, the shorter their lifespan will be, so try to keep the washing and product use to a minimum.\" Nonsynthetic extensions can and should be washed just like the hair on your head. This helps prevent product, dirt, and oil buildup on the hair. \"Use a mild shampoo and conditioner, keeping conditioners away from the attachment points,\" says Bailey. However, just as you don't want to overwash your own hair, try to avoid washing your extensions too much. \"Unlike your own hair, which receives natural hydration from the oils on your scalp, hair extensions don't have a natural hydration source,\" says Venturin. \"Therefore, keeping them hydrated is key to keeping them shiny and in good condition.\" Cost of Hair Extensions If you're wondering, how much do hair extensions cost? That's a hard question to answer due to the many different types of hair extensions available on the market - hair extension prices are based on the hair you choose, as well as who installs it. \"High-quality, hand-tied hair extensions will look more natural and last longer than synthetic extensions but require a higher cost to purchase and install,\" says Brynn Reed, the lead extension specialist at Mirror Mirror Salon. Quality extensions made from human hair, such as clip-ins, typically range from $100 to $350, while more \"permanent,\" long-wearing extensions that are professionally installed can cost $350 to upward of $2,000. Synthetic hair extensions, on the other hand, are far cheaper. Things to Keep in Mind When Getting Hair Extensions There are many benefits to extensions, but you should consider your current hair routine to determine if they're right for you. \"Extensions are not a wash-and-go style,\" says Reed. \"They must be blow-dried. Leaving extensions wet for prolonged periods causes the wefts to break down and shortens the lifespan of your extensions. If you commit to extensions, you commit to the blow-out.\" Additionally, the haircut you have matters. Extensions are able to add volume and length to your existing style, but in order for the final result to look seamless, you'll want to avoid any blunt-style haircuts. \"This makes the job so much harder to blend,\" says Bailey.

    "title": "Revlon's Viral Blow-Dry Brush Is on Sale Right Now - Here's Why We Love It",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/revlon-one-step-hair-dryer-volumizer-plus-review-48638494",
    "description": "When I think about beauty tools that have gone viral, the first product that comes to mind is Revlon's One-Step Hair Dryer and Volumizer. Not only does it have more than 360,000 five-star reviews on Amazon, but I honestly can't scroll my TikTok feed without seeing at least one person using this fan-favorite blow-dryer brush. It's easy to see why: not only is it affordable, but it's helped countless people achieve salon-worthy blowouts from the comfort of their own homes. Although this product has amassed what can only be described as a cult following, users still had suggestions for improvement. Revlon's response? The One-Step Volumizer Plus ($37, originally $70). I tried out the older version of Revlon's blow-dryer brush, but the brush head was a little too big for me and made it difficult to nail down my go-to style. Also, I didn't love the heat settings because it felt like the high heat was too much for my hair, but the low setting was too low to set the style I was looking to achieve. In the end, it left my hair feeling a little dry and dehydrated, so I opted to use a different tool for my at-home blowouts. However, my best friend uses the older version of Revlon's blow-dry brush and swears by it, so when I heard about the improvements and the smaller brush attachment on the newest version, I decided it was time to give the blow-dry brush a second chance. After I started seeing glowing reviews for the newer version on TikTok I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. When I received it in the mail, I eagerly awaited wash day so I could finally test it out - spoiler alert, it was everything I wanted and more. Plus, it's currently on major sale for Amazon's October Prime Day, which started Oct. 8. We're talking 47 percent off. Keep reading for everything you need to know about the Revolon brush blow dryer, as well as my before and after photos. About the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus Blow-Dryer Brush The most recent tool has ceramic-titanium tourmaline technology, which helps reduce heat damage and protect hair against it. It has low, medium, high, and cool heat settings for easy customization. (The previous version only had low, high, and cool.) While the original version had a 4.25-inch oval brush, the newest version comes with a 2.4-inch oval brush. The brush head is detachable for easy storing and traveling. What I Like About the Revlon Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus Blow-Dryer Brush The biggest difference I noticed between this brush and others I've used in the past is how well my hairstyle stayed put. Although I think I've pretty much mastered the '90s blowout, I've often found that the look can fall throughout the day if I don't use a ton of hairspray or texture spray. I didn't use either after the Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer, and my flipped-in ends lasted even after a night of sleeping on them. While my hair sometimes felt dry when using the older version of this blow-dryer brush, my experience with the newer version was the opposite: it was smooth and shiny. How to Use the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus Blow-Dryer Brush When wash day finally arrived, I prepped my damp, clean hair with a leave-in conditioner, hair oil, and a heat protectant. I then waited until my hair was about 85 percent dry, and I separated it into sections. I started out by running the brush through my ends, then curled and flipped the hair under. I repeated those steps for the middle and top sections, and in the end, I was left with a perfect blowout. What to Consider Before Trying the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus Blow-Dryer Brush My only wish is that this tool had an option for different attachments, but with the detachable head as a brand-new feature, who knows what Revlon has in store for the future. Still, if you're looking for an affordable way to achieve a salon-worthy blowout without ever stepping foot outside of your house, either add Revlon's One-Step Hair Dryer to your cart or add it to your wish list ASAP. Where the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus Blow-Dryer Brush Is Available The Revlon Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus is available on Amazon and Target.

    "title": "The Viral Cosrx Snail Mucin Essence Is Half Off Right Now",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Cosrx-Advanced-Snail-96-Mucin-Power-Essence-Review-46422012",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Kelsey Garcia My skin-care inspiration is that of a glazed doughnut. I dream of having hydrated, dewy, and near-reflective skin, and I'm happy to report that a recent purchase has brought me closer than ever to my goal: the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ($13, originally $25). I'm by no means the first person to rave about this beauty product. In fact, the essence already has quite the cult following. (A facial essence, by the way, is a concentrated yet lightweight lotion applied after cleanser but before moisturizer.) This particular one by Cosrx claims to hydrate the skin and even out its texture, all the while minimizing fine lines and acne scars. So, yeah, it's promising a lot. The secret to the product's success is snail mucin, an ingredient that's been appearing in more widely available skin-care products in the last few years. It's believed that the mucin naturally possesses moisturizing ingredients like hyaluronic acid and glycolic acid, to name a few. Some studies have also shown that it can reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles, according to research published in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology. And as far as I'm concerned, it's a must-have for everyone. Right now it's on major sale for Amazon's October Prime Day, so make sure you stock up while it's still available. Keep reading to learn more about the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence. About the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence Key ingredients include snail secretion filtrate (a substance derived from snails and beloved for its hydrating benefits), soothing allantoin, and hydrating hyaluronic acid. It's highly rated on retailer sites like Amazon, with nearly 75,000 five-star ratings. It doesn't contain any fragrance, sulfates, or parabens. What I Like About the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence I'll admit, I bought this essence before I knew anything about what it really was or snail mucin benefits. Instead, I simply kept seeing mentions of the product across the internet, recognized that it was fairly affordable and - since I'm gullible - that's really all it took. So off I went to oo35mm, a local beauty shop frequented by skin-care connoisseurs, in search of a bottle of the stuff. Because I am in my late 20s and own a smartphone, I posted a photo of my purchases on Instagram Stories. I kid you not, no selfie I have ever posted has received such engagement. (Frankly, I should have been offended.) Some people inquired about the whole snail situation, but most of the people who replied said they were longtime fans of the essence. There were a lot of flame emojis involved. It's been months since I started using the essence daily. I use it after cleansing and before applying moisturizer, and I am a complete convert. Though I was worried the additional skin-care step would clog my pores over time, leading to pimples and what have you, my skin's texture has actually improved, and it feels way more even now. The hydration payoff is also huge, and I feel like it actually helps my moisturizer work better, too. For a while, I had been feeling as though the cream would just sit atop my skin after application, and now I feel like it's actually penetrating through and sinking in. Best of all, I finally feel close to glazed doughnut status. Image Source: Amazon What to Consider Before Trying the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence One thing to consider before trying the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence is that the texture isn't for everyone. To me, it feels sticky just for a few seconds before absorbing into my skin completely. This fleeting stickiness, though brief, has deterred some users. It's worth noting: the majority of shoppers agree that it ultimately doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky, and as far as I'm concerned, that shopper was being a tad dramatic. Nonetheless, if that initial texture will throw you for a loop, you might want to consider a different product. Where Is the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence Available? The Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence is available at Amazon and Ulta Beauty.

    "title": "Grab These Bestselling Crest Whitestrips While They're on Sale",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/crest-whitestrips-review-49221813",
    "description": "In the lead-up to my wedding, there are several beauty treatments I've either already outsourced or plan to indulge in before the big day. From acrylic nails to a natural-looking spray tan and even laser hair removal, there's no doubt I'm holding back. However, there was one treatment I couldn't bring myself to undergo professionally: teeth whitening. The intense post-treatment discomfort during my first attempt years ago left me determined to explore other options. So, here I am now, typing this with my top and bottom teeth sandwiched in Crest 3D Whitestrips ($30, originally $46) opting for an at-home solution that suits me better. While experiences vary, this is officially my chosen method to achieve a brighter smile, and I plan on stocking up since they're currently on sale for Amazon's October Prime Day. Ahead, I break down more details about them. Keep reading for my full review and to see my before-and-after photos. About Crest 3D Whitestrips Crest Whitestrips have been around since 2001. It comes with a total of 44 strips (22 upper and 22 lower): 20 Professional Effects Treatments and two One-Hour Express Treatments. The American Dental Association (ADA) Crest 3D Whitestrips recognizes Crest Whitestrips as a safe and effective method for teeth whitening. For best results, the brand recommends using them once a day for 30 minutes. What I Like About Crest 3D Whitestrips What truly impresses me about Crest 3D Whitestrips is how effective they are. Even though it had been well over a decade since I last used them, I couldn't resist trying them again and added them to my virtual Amazon shopping cart. The box boldly claimed they could \"remove over 15 years of stains in three days,\" which initially made me a bit skeptical. However, the results speak for themselves. Crest 3D Whitestrips Before and After After just four treatments, the difference is already remarkable. The \"before\" image on the left and the \"after\" image on the right clearly shows the noticeable change. And I've barely made a dent in the box with plenty of treatments left. How to Use Crest 3D Whitestrips Using Crest 3D Whitestrips is a straightforward process. Within a box containing 20 treatments, each strip is individually wrapped for convenience, which makes them travel-friendly. To use them, you simply peel open the packaging using the tear notch and then place the longer strip on the front of your upper teeth and the shorter strip on your lower teeth. As you do this, try to aim to align the straight edge of the strip with your gumline and then fold over the back side of your teeth to secure it in place. Leave the strips on for 30 minutes, and then remove them. I always brush my teeth afterward to get rid of the peroxide taste, but that's ultimately a personal preference. It's important to note that perfecting the application process may require some trial and error. I found that the grippy texture of the whitening strips worked really well on my top teeth but not as effectively on my bottom teeth. Toward the end of the 30 minutes, I noticed that the bottom strip tended to slide off, resulting in a gap in coverage. Similar experiences have been shared by other shoppers. One satisfied Amazon customer, who rated them five stars and considered them worth the money, mentioned that \"the bottom strips seemed to not stick properly but other than that they work FANTASTICALLY!!\" Another equally impressed shopper agreed, stating, \"I found the bottom is a bit harder to stay on, but other than that, they work well!\" What to Consider Before Trying Teeth Whitening Strips Before trying teeth whitening strips, it's important to be aware of the potential for irritation. I experienced soreness and had to take a Tylenol to alleviate the sensitivity, which persisted throughout the day. As a result, I decided to skip a day to avoid dealing with the discomfort again. However, when I resumed using them, I didn't experience any pain and have been using them nightly ever since. When deciding on a teeth whitening method, it's essential to consider if whitening strips are the best fit for you. As someone who values the convenience of whitening my teeth at home, saving money, and being able to multitask, the strips have become my preferred option over professional treatments. However, it's important to acknowledge that there are alternative options available, such as toothpastes and gels that can be directly applied to your teeth or via a tray that fits in your mouth. According to the American Dental Association (ADA), in-office teeth whitening treatments may have stronger effects, which aligns with my experience of feeling significant discomfort afterward. The ADA states: \"Bleaching compounds in over-the-counter whitening products are typically peroxide-based and contain carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide at lower concentrations compared to in-office or dentist-prescribed, at-home bleaching techniques.\" Nonetheless, I'm cool with sticking with my whitestrips, especially since the results are top-notch. And finally, Crest recommends a few maintenance tips to get the most out of your whitestrips. \"If you drink cola drinks, sip them through a straw to minimize the contact of the drink with your white teeth,\" the brand states on its website. Likewise, they advise you \"rinse your mouth as soon as possible to minimize the risk of stains if you drink coffee, tea, red wine, or cola, or eat foods that are likely to stain your white teeth.\" As an avid coffee drinker, I've been making a point to rinse with Crest Whitening Rinse Fresh Mint Mouthwash ($26) after getting my coffee fix.

    "title": "This Shower Oil Cured My Dry, Itchy Skin in a Week - and It's 20% Off",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/loccitane-cleansing-softening-almond-shower-oil-review-49398826",
    "description": "Don't tell my lotion-obsessed sisters, but I skipped way too many days of moisturizing my body over the summer. I find the routine of lathering on body oil, cream, or body butter on my skin post-shower to be tedious - an added step that takes time away from something else I could be doing. As you probably guessed, a season full of skin-baring outfits without hydration has left me with parched, itchy skin. I've been looking for a solution to minimize the itchiness and dry appearance that doesn't require weeks of applying lotion. The L'Occitane Cleansing \u0026 Softening Almond Shower Oil ($23, originally $29) has garnered the nod of approval from many beauty editors and has five beauty awards from various magazines at time of posting, so I decided to test it out. Spoiler alert: I was instantly hooked. Keep reading for more details about the shower oil and why it's become my new favorite multitasking hydration product. Plus, right now it's on sale for Amazon's October Prime Day, so make sure you snag it at a discount while it's still in stock. About the L'Occitane Cleansing \u0026 Softening Almond Shower Oil It's a two-in-one shower oil that cleanses dirt and impurities while deeply hydrating the skin and giving it a radiant glow. The oil-to-milky formula can be used all over the body to soften skin. Its formula includes sweet almond oil, grapeseed oil, vitamin E \u0026 Beta-sitosterol, omega 9 and 6 fatty acids, and squalene. Regular use is said to turn skin firmer and smoother, according to the brand. What I Like About the L'Occitane Cleansing \u0026 Softening Almond Shower Oil The brand claims one bottle of this product sells every 10 seconds worldwide. It's packed with sweet almond oil and grapeseed oil, and after using it for less than a week, I can truly tell why it's so popular. Unlike traditional body washes, this shower oil foams to clean off the day, producing a sweet (and not super overpowering) fragrance that leaves my skin the smoothest it's ever been from a shower wash. Before I even step out of the shower I notice that my skin looks and feels more hydrated. The brand attributes this to the almond oil that is known to moisturize skin, protect it from sun damage, and improve texture; and grapeseed oil that is high in linoleic acid which increases the skin's moisture and softness. Being able to use the two-in-one product in lieu of a post-cleansing lotion has completely streamlined my body-care routine. I no longer have to set aside time to spritz on body oil, wait for it to dry, and then follow up with a lotion. The L'Occitane Cleansing \u0026 Softening Almond Shower Oil takes care of all these steps for me with its deeply moisturizing ingredients. Plus, the freshly baked Parisian-almond croissant aroma pleasantly lingers on my skin for up to an hour. Testing products is a huge part of my job as a beauty editor. And while so many hydrating body products claim to keep the skin moisturized all day long, few actually do. But with this shower oil, I've found myself caressing my arms (my biggest dry skin problem area) throughout the day, in awe of their softness. How to Use the L'Occitane Cleansing \u0026 Softening Almond Shower Oil The luxurious formula emulsifies into a hydrating, velvety milky foam that easily lathers onto any cleansing tool of choice. It's meant to be used on wet skin while in the shower. In testing it over the course of four days, I've tried applying it with a loofah, washcloth, and mini exfoliating gloves. Each time it's produced a really beautiful scent that lathers perfectly when it comes into contact with water. Even though it's an oil, this formula is non-greasy and won't leave a sticky residue. Word to the wise though, a little bit goes a long way. I tend to add just two to three dollops to my loofah and scrub away the dirt from head to toe for consistent, silky-smooth results. What to Consider Before Trying the L'Occitane Cleansing \u0026 Softening Almond Shower Oil The almond shower oil has a beautifully subtle scent to it. However, if you are sensitive to fragrance, this might not be the product for you. Purchasing it repeatedly also may be an expensive habit to pick up, given that it's priced at $29 for just 8.4 fluid ounces. But it's important to note that if you use just a couple of drops per wash, the oil should last for a few weeks. Where Is the L'Occitane Cleansing \u0026 Softening Almond Shower Oil Available? You can get the L'Occitane Cleansing \u0026 Softening Almond Shower Oil at Amazon, L'Occitane, Sephora, Nordstrom, Ulta Beauty, and Anthropologie.

    "title": "Taylor Swift's Game-Day Glitter Freckles Are Only $16",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/taylor-swift-glitter-freckles-49399415",
    "description": "Whenever Taylor Swift attends a Kanas City Chiefs game to support her boyfriend, football tight end Travis Kelce, all eyes are on her: what will she wear? Will she keep her signature red lipstick or try a new hue? What A-lister friends will she bring with her in the box? At the game on Oct. 7 against the New Orleans Saints, the singer arrived at the stadium wearing a gray and red plaid, off-the-shoulder mini dress, a flirty high ponytail, and glitter freckles that now have everyone clamoring to learn how to recreate them. Swift's glitter freckles included dots of silver and red sprawled across her nose and cheeks, which complemented her red lipstick and cat eyeliner. The unexpected yet perfectly executed beauty detail was the cherry on top of her entire look. Anyone who's ever attempted faux freckles knows the application process can be a bit tedious, but Swift had a little help from a small business called Fazit Beauty. The brand makes freckle patches that come in sheets and act as a temporary tattoo for your face, saving you time on painstakingly applying each freckle. For Swift's glitter freckles, it appears she used the Silver Glitter Freckles Makeup Patches ($16), which also come in gold. Fazit's founder, Aliett Butts, explained in a TikTok video that she sent Swift's makeup artist, Lorrie Turk, a few patches in the spring of 2023 in hopes of getting the brand on the star's radar, but she didn't know if it would happen. Now, months later, it seems to have worked. Ahead, see another photo of Swift's glitter freckles and head over to Fazit's website to get yours - we have a feeling these are going to be everywhere this football season.

    "description": "Halloween may still be a few weeks away, but Bath \u0026 Body Works is ready to drop its highly anticipated Halloween collection. Just like last year, the 70-plus-piece collection is filled with spooky candles, lotions, hand soaps, accessories, and more.

    "title": "I Tried a \"Jaw Bra,\" and the Results Were Undeniable",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/jaw-bra-editor-experiment-48978632",
    "description": "Over the last few months, I've been seeing \"jaw bras\" and \"face bras\" all over social media. For the unfamiliar, these products are face masks worn on the underside of the chin and jaw that hook over the ears. Most of these masks claim to tighten skin and eliminate double chins, which is something I'm definitely interested in. I'm still too scared to try anything even marginally invasive like plastic surgery or Botox, so I decided to hop on the face-bra bandwagon and try one for myself. The jaw bra that I tested out is the Wishful Chin Lift Peptide and Niacinamide Sculpting Sheet Mask ($9). The product is formulated with ingredients like peppermint and niacinamide to soothe inflammation and improve the appearance of textured skin. Unlike traditional sheet masks made from microfiber or cotton, this product is made from a woven cotton material that is typically used for athletic tape. Experts Featured in This Article Edward Chamata, MD, is a plastic surgeon based in Texas who specializes in aesthetic surgery for the face, breasts, and body. Konstantin Vasyukevich, MD, is a facial plastic surgeon based in New York City, best known for face lift surgery. To try it out, I started by washing and drying my face. The directions stated to apply the product on a clean, dry face, so I skipped my skin-care routine and went straight for the mask. After taking it out of the package and peeling off the protective film, I stretched it out a tiny bit by pulling on either end to ensure it wasn't too tight. I placed the middle of the mask directly on my chin and pulled upward on each side until I had secured each side around my ears. I then set a timer for 30 minutes and let the mask do its thing. The mask felt a little uncomfortable while I was wearing it, but mostly, my chin and jaw just felt securely held in place. I could still move my neck and head around easily, and although it looked a bit funny, it wasn't too difficult to wear for half an hour. For me, the worst part was the area where the mask hooked over my ears. It felt similar to wearing an N-95 mask on my face, except it was a lot heavier and tighter and left my ears feeling sore around the 20-minute mark. When I took the mask off to inspect the results, I was genuinely shocked to see that my chin and jaw looked slimmer. I compared my before and after photos, and the difference was instantly visible. The skin underneath my chin looked flatter rather than puffy as it had before. Plus, not only did my face look slimmer, but the skin that was under the mask also felt hydrated and soft to the touch. Although the results from using the mask were distinct at first, after three hours, my chin went back to normal. This had me wondering how masks like this actually worked and whether they're a good long-term solution. How Do Jaw Bras Work? \"The likely mechanism by which these devices work is by adding compression to areas such as the under-chin region, which then temporarily decreases the amount of lymphatic fluid in that region,\" plastic surgeon Edward Chamata, MD, tells PS. \"This may create a temporary appearance of a more defined jawline since there's less fluid in that region due to compression.\" I was surprised to learn that there are some disadvantages to wearing these masks too frequently. \"The downside of using such devices could be the reduction in tone of the underlying muscles, which in turn would lead to more, not less, sagging,\" Konstantin Vasyukevich, MD, double board-certified plastic surgeon, says. If you're looking for permanent ways to shape your face and jawline, both Dr. Chamata and Dr. Vasyukevich agree that surgical intervention is usually necessary. Liposuction, buccal fat removal, and facelifts are common examples of procedures that would permanently change the face. However, for those looking for less invasive alternatives, Dr. Chamata suggests radio-frequency skin-tightening devices such as the celebrity-loved Morpheus8 or FaceTite, which can be performed in office without general anesthesia. Personally, I plan on continuing to use this mask ahead of big nights out or scenarios where I'm having my photo taken because the results are undeniable, and I'm still not quite ready to head down the plastic-surgery road just yet.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/nipple-tattoos-49004372",
    "description": "There are a handful of reasons why someone might find themselves seeking a restorative breast tattoo: they might have had a double mastectomy, gender-confirming top surgery, a reconstruction surgery post-accident, and so on. After undergoing a breast reconstruction, getting an areola or nipple tattoo is often the final step in restoring the appearance of your chest. \"This service is most commonly offered to those who have undergone mastectomies due to breast cancer but can be helpful for anyone who has a need for it,\" tattoo artist Shaughnessy Otsuji tells PS. \"I work with trans men and women and nonbinary folks who have received top surgery or other chest reconstruction; clients who have burns, skin grafts, or other scarring that has affected their chest; as well as anyone who is unhappy with their natural nipples and may need reshaping or repigmentation.\" There are tattoo artists that specialize in restorative ink, such as Otsuji, ensuring that you get the most natural, realistic results. \"This type of tattooing is so emotional, yet so rewarding, and the most exciting as it yields instant results,\" she says. \"Something as visual as restoring nipples that have been previously removed is very impactful.\" Learn more about the process of getting an areola or nipple tattoo below. Experts Featured in This Article Shaughnessy Otsuji is the owner and a tattoo artist at Studio Sashiko. How Soon After Surgery Can You Get an Areola Tattoo? In the case of a mastectomy, it's generally recommended that you wait six to 12 months post-radiation and chemotherapy to undergo breast reconstruction. In all cases of chest surgery, the scar should be healed before booking an appointment for a tattoo. \"Scars should be completely healed and settled into the skin as much as possible before attempting to tattoo over them,\" Otsuji. At her studio, they ask clients to wait for a minimum of six months post-surgery. \"This wait time allows for necessary healing, scar maturation, and breast settlement to take place. Areola tattoos should be the final step in the reconstruction process.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by shaughnessy otsuji (@shaughnessy) What It's Like to Get a Nipple Tattoo Going to a tattoo artist who specializes in reconstructive tattooing will help you get the most realistic-looking results. \"Every areola tattoo is completely customized to the clients,\" says Otsuji. \"I strive to create the most realistic results by adding strategic details, highlights, shadows, and dimensions, and choosing a collection of colors that suits their skin best. The end result is an undetectable, realistic areola that looks like one they would have had naturally.\" Once you're ready to start the tattoo process, you'll have a consultation with your artist. \"During this consultation, we'll discuss the client's desired nipple size, placement, and pigment colors that complement their skin,\" says Otsuji. \"I'll also want to assess the client's skin type and any scar patterns or scar tissue that may require more technical skill to achieve the end result.\" From there, a custom areola design is made and applied to the chest, just like when you get a tattoo in others areas. With the stencil in place, a tattoo machine will be used to create the design on the skin. \"In most cases, the skin can be quite thin, scarred, and delicate after surgery so a gentle approach must be taken when tattooing this type of skin,\" says Otsuji. \"Any professional offering these types of services must be careful not to overwork the skin and to avoid causing more damage.\" In total, this can take anywhere from two to two and a half hours to complete. Keep in mind that \"it can sometimes take multiple sessions to achieve the most detailed and realistic results.\" Do Nipple Tattoos Hurt? A common question asked is if getting a restorative tattoo is painful. \"The majority of my clients experience loss of feeling in the area after their mastectomy due to tissue removal and nerve damage,\" says Otsuji. \"For those who still have some sensitivity, a topical anesthetic called Zensa is applied to numb the skin and keep the client relaxed.\" How Much Do Nipple Tattoos Cost? The price of this type of tattoo depends on the studio, as well as the amount of work needed. On average, Otsuji says her studio charges $500 to $700.

    "description": "Planning for Halloween doesn't have to be difficult. Some of the best looks have little to do with the clothing, and everything to do with the hairstyle involved.

    "title": "\"Fairy-Core\" Nails Are the Official \"Soft Girl\" Manicure, According to TikTok",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/fairy-core-nails-49324131",
    "description": "If you're still fully in your soft-girl era, with a beauty routine that includes \"sugar plum fairy\" makeup and \"stained-glass skin,\" we've got a nail nail trend you're going to be obsessed with. It's called \"fairy-core\" nails, and we promise it's right up your alley. The manicure takes classic fairy traits and turns them into a stunning nail design. Think wings, florals, sparkles, metallics, and even 3D embellishments. You can completely customize the look based on your preferences, but one thing is for sure: it's the whimsical, ethereal, fanciful design that's sure to garner you tons of compliments. Ahead, nail experts break down everything to know about fairy-core nails, including what they are and how to get the look at home. Keep reading to learn everything there is to know about the viral TikTok trend. Experts Featured in This Article Michelle Nguyen is a nail expert and founder and CEO of PLA, a professional nail supply company. Jin Soon Choi is a nail expert and founder of the nail-care brand JINsoon. Mazz Hanna is the CEO of Nailing Hollywood Agency based in Los Angeles. What Are Fairy-Core Nails? \"Fairy-core nails are all about bright pastels, soft designs, and nature-themed art that evokes the fantasy and spirit of the spritely fairy and elf world,\" Michelle Nguyen, nail expert and founder and CEO of PLA tells PS. Jin Soon Choi, nail expert and founder of JINsoon, agrees, adding, \"Fairy-core nails are a bold and robust iteration of traditional fairy nails. While fairy nails tend to be delicate and adorned with glitter, fairy-core nails take it up a notch with elements like 3D designs, elongated shapes, and a fashion-forward, edgy aesthetic.\" As for what kinds of 3D designs you'll see, Mazz Hanna, CEO of Nailing Hollywood Agency, says the trend \"incorporates designs and textures from wings, florals, sparkles and metallics, [which] creates an ethereal manicure.\" Both long and short lengths work for the trend, depending on the desired look, although a longer nail does mean more surface area for an intricate design. On the other hand, \"short nails can add a cuteness to the look and help make it more wearable,\" Nguyen says. The shape is entirely up to you, although Hanna notes that her favorite choice for this look is a medium length with a rounded edge. How to Get Fairy-Core Nails If you're visiting a salon, as always, it's important to arrive with inspiration photos in hand and discuss what you're looking for with your nail technician. If you're looking to recreate the manicure at home, unless you're well-versed in nail art, Choi suggests opting for a simplified version of the trend. \"Consider a white pearl base featuring a playful splash of multi-glitter or embellished with pearls or crystals,\" she says. To get a pared-down version of the look, begin by cleaning, prepping, and shaping your nails to your desired shape using a nail file like the JINsoon High Performance Diamond Nail File ($35). From there, apply a base coat. If you're looking for something that will stand out, we suggest opting for a fun pastel tone, however, if you want a more neutral shade, opt for something like JinSoon Akoya ($18). Brush on two coats, let it dry, and then go in with glitter polishes in different shades, like the Olive and June OBVI ($9) or Olive and June Exclamation Point ($9). If you're interested in adding a 3D element to your nails, we'd suggest purchasing the Amazon 3D Mix Assorted Nail Color Charms ($7), which include wings, hearts, pearls, and stars. If, on the other hand, you'd like to take the easiest route possible when it comes to securing your fairy-core manicure, there are press-on options available. Our favorite is the Bukbuvlo Fairy Ballet French Tips ($9). Keep scrolling to check out some of our favorite iterations of fairy-core nails for inspiration. Fairy-Core Nails Inspiration",

    "title": "This Genius Aluminum-Foil Hack Smooths Frizz in Seconds",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/frizzy-hair-aluminum-foil-editor-experiment-48811614",
    "description": "At this point in my career, I've tried hundreds - maybe even thousands - of frizzy hair products. Some help temporarily banish the halo of flyaways around my roots while others just don't do it for me, so I'm always on the hunt for a new hair hack to get the job done. One night on TikTok, I stumbled upon people rubbing aluminum foil on their heads to smooth frizzy ends and I immediately ran to my kitchen to grab a piece and try it out for myself. In the videos - and yes, there were multiple - people simply ran a piece of foil over their hair to make it look sleeker. The results were pretty much instantaneous, which blew me away. I couldn't explain how or why it works (science, I guess?), but it was clear that it did. To test it out myself, I grabbed a piece of aluminum cooking foil that was about one foot by a half a foot wide. I was working with day four hair, which typically for me starts to look a little stringy at the ends and frizzy at the roots. I started by dividing my hair down the middle and pulling it over both shoulders. Then, scrunching the foil in my hand slightly, I wrapped it around one side of my head and pulled down, creating some tension with my hair. I also tried to smooth my roots with the foil by rubbing it on my scalp. It took me a few passes to see results, but when I compared the right side to the left side, it was pretty clear. I repeated the process on the other side of my head using the same piece of foil and saw that section of hair become instantly smoother. All in all, the frizzy hair hack took me less than a minute and delivered instantaneous results. Though the smoothing benefits only lasted about an hour or so, it made my hair look nicer for the photos I took immediately after trying it. I'm still not entirely sure how it works - maybe the foil is removing some of the static in the hair? - but the proof is in the photos.

    "title": "Can I Wash My Hair After Dyeing It? Hairstylists Weigh In",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/when-to-wash-hair-after-coloring-47869133",
    "description": "Experimenting with your hair color can be a fun way to change up your look or get through a stifled style period. (Finding the specific shade you want can also be a source of stress, but once you land on a decision you're happy with, it's pretty close to the best feeling.) While it's often much cheaper than shelling out for a new wardrobe, coloring your hair is still an investment, and you want to make sure it lasts as long as possible, which means knowing when to wash your hair after coloring, and if you should wash your hair before dyeing it. Proper maintenance is the number one way to ensure your color stays looking fresh, so it's important to know which color-safe products to buy, how often to go in for touch-ups, and the rules of washing your hair to prevent fading. That's right, washing your hair is often framed as a key cause of fading color, but as it turns out, the answer to your burning question, \"When can I wash my hair after dyeing it?\" is less about when and more about how. To help explain, we asked a colorist for everything you need to know. Experts Featured in This Article Sydney Palmer is a hair-color specialist at Estetica Salon \u0026 Spa in St. Paul, MN. Jade Kromer is a hair-color specialist at Juut Salon Spa in Minneapolis. How Long to Wait to Wash Hair After Coloring \"Lots of people believe that the color needs to set in your hair for a few days after coloring - that's actually just a myth,\" hair-color specialist Sydney Palmer tells PS. \"The hair color doesn't set in any more than it already has if you wait to wash it.\" So if you've ever wondered, \"Can I wash my hair 24 hours after dyeing it?\" you have your answer, once and for all. Hair-color specialist Jade Kromer adds that you can wash your hair as soon as you need to (although you likely won't need to that day if you're coming fresh from the salon). \"Washing your hair right after you color it really isn't the problem,\" she says. \"Focus more on what products you're using rather than time in between shampoos.\" You might be wondering, why do salons wash your hair after coloring? The answer is simple: they want to make sure all the dye is out of your hair before getting you styled. They might even double-wash your hair: once to get rid of the dye, and a second time to fully cleanse your hair. Why Is My Color Fading? When it comes to hair dye, it's much more important to prevent the dye from leaching out than it is to let it \"set\" in your hair initially. Each strand of hair is surrounded by the cuticle, which is what traps the color in. When you wash your hair, particularly in hot water, you risk opening up the cuticle and letting the color bleed out. Palmer recommended washing colored hair in cooler water: \"That makes your hair cuticle stay closed and keeps your hair color trapped inside the strands of hair. Warm water makes the cuticle more likely to open and let the color out, which is why color fades so fast.\" Then comes the question of how to keep your hair color vibrant. If a cold shower doesn't sound appealing to you, you can also wash your hair less frequently and try to avoid water that's steaming hot. If you choose what's known as a \"fashion color\" for your hair, such as bright pink, orange, or purple, Kromer recommends washing just once a week and using dry shampoo in the meantime, like the Divi Dry Shampoo Spray ($26). These colors typically require bleaching the hair, which can make cuticles more porous and, therefore, more likely to leak color in the shower. If you just have highlights or lowlights instead of full hair color, you can be a little more lax about water temperature, Palmer says. Less pigment in the hair means that the temperature of the water matters less. In addition to how frequently you wash your hair and the temperature, what you wash it with can make a big difference in how long your color lasts. \"The type of shampoo, conditioner, and products you use at home are the ultimate reason why your color is going to last or fade,\" Kromer says. \"Drugstore shampoos may feel like they're getting your hair and scalp really clean, but they can have chemicals in them that are linked to fading of professional hair color. If you invest in your products, you'll realize how much more life you'll get from your color.\" Some drugstore brands of shampoo and conditioner can contain synthetic ingredients like sulfates, parabens, silicone, and other ingredients that can strip the hair of its color. When you invest in high-quality hair care, you're investing in your hair color and overall hair health. Palmer also recommends watching out for clarifying shampoos, which are \"great for getting your scalp clean, but more likely to strip hair of its color.\" As such, it's best to use those sparingly. Should You Wash Your Hair Before Dyeing It? The short answer: \"Yes, but there's really no need,\" Palmer says. Your colorist will have done that for you. If you head straight from the salon to the gym and need to wash your hair afterward, don't fret - just use cooler water and quality products for your hair type. Palmer recommended washing no more than three times per week with cooler water and the right products. Another tip for avoiding dullness is to regularly use a hair-color mask like the Olaplex No. 8 Bond Intense Moisture Hair Mask ($30) or Shu Uemura's Color Lustre Treatment Mask for Color Treated Hair ($72). Do You Need Shampoo to Rinse Out Hair Dye? If you're dyeing your hair at home, when it's time to rinse it out, simply use cold water. You should continue rinsing your hair until the water runs completely clear, which signifies that all the dye has been washed out. From there, feel free to shampoo with your typical product and then follow up with a conditioner. Some manufacturers' instructions require forgoing shampoo after dyeing your hair, so make sure to read the instructions on the product you're using.

Born between January 20 to February 18, those who fall under this sign are often described as free-spirited and forward-thinking - the perfect creative minds that would be open to getting some body art as an expression of their personality and beliefs. Getting a tattoo can be a highly personal choice, but if you're an Aquarius who's been looking for a unique idea or starting point for your own DIY design, why not consider one that is inspired by your zodiac sign? Aquarius tattoos offer an incredible amount of wiggle room as you can opt for a version of your sign's symbol, which is exemplified by two parallel waves, your actual zodiac sign (also known as the water bearer), or even your constellation. Whether you want something small and dainty, easy to hide, or a piece that is a conversation starter, going for any of these Aquarius zodiac tattoos will ensure that you have artwork on your body that is unique and tailored to your tastes with a touch of personality. Of course, trying to come up with your own Aquarius tattoo ideas can be like trying to find a needle in a haystack, so we went ahead and rounded up some options for you to use as a starting point for your own ink or that you can recreate with your own personal flair. From fine-line pieces with special touches to hyper-realistic portraits, you'll be sure to find plenty of Aquarius symbol tattoos, Aquarius constellation tattoos, and much more, ahead.

    "title": "The Pageboy Cut Is the Latest Controversial Haircut Making a Comeback",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/pageboy-cut-49288691",
    "description": "Haircuts like the bob and shag will never go out of style, but sometimes, it's fun to shake things up a bit with a more out-there - and dare we say controversial - haircut. The \"octopus\" and \"jellyfish\" hairstyles are both solid options, but we'd like to make a case for the modern page cut. Formerly more widely known as the \"pageboy\" cut, this ultra-short, sleek style is primed and ready to take over in the upcoming season. If you're scratching your head wondering what the haircut is, the style is believed to be named after page boys of medieval times who wore a bowl cut-esque style, but fear not - it's come a long way since then. The trend was repopularized in the '70s and '80s, before falling out of favor once again. Now, it's been rebranded as the page cut - and back and better than ever. To learn more about the modern-day pageboy cut, keep scrolling as two professional hairstylists break it down. Experts Featured in This Article Andrew Zumbo is a hairstylist and American Crew brand ambassador. Ilham Mestour is a hairstylist and artistic director of Balmain Hair. What Is the Pageboy Cut? So what exactly is the page cut aside from a hairstyle worn by little kids in the 1400s? \"It's characterized by its straight, blunt-cut, shoulder-length or slightly shorter hair, often with blunt bangs,\" hairstylist Andrew Zumbo tells PS. It's best known for its smooth, rounded shape but since getting a little upgrade, the style has been softened just a touch, making it a lot more wearable. \"It is a sleek and geometric cut that is tailored to the individual's specific hair type and face shape, ensuring a flattering and polished look,\" says Ilham Mestour, hairstylist and artistic director of Balmain Hair. \"One of the key factors that contribute to the enduring popularity of the page bob is its versatility.\" The haircut is suited for all hair types, as long as it's adapted properly. \"Keep in mind that individual preferences and face shapes can also influence how well this haircut suits a person and is worn,\" says Zumbo. Mestour adds, \"The length, whether it be chin-length or shoulder-length, has a way of complementing and enhancing different features.\" For example, she says, \"It can soften angular jawlines and add balance to rounder faces.\" While it's commonly styled sleek and straight, which accents the clean lines and sharp, blunt ends of the cut, it can also be worn on curly and coily hair for extra volume. Modernizing the Pageboy Cut Though thought to be timeless in its original state, if you want to bring the page cut into the 21st century, there are a few adaptations you can make. This includes playing with layers, bangs, and the overall length. The page cut isn't too different from your classic bob haircut - the key difference is the rounded, doom-like shape. To put a contemporary spin on the page cut, Zumbo recommends adding \"subtle layers to add movement and texture to the hair\" or tweaking the bangs. \"Instead of traditional straight-across bangs, try a side-swept fringe or curtain bangs for a current, on-trend feel,\" he says. How to Style a Pageboy Cut At the salon, your hairstylist should be able to tailor the page cut as needed to best suit your hair texture, face shape, and at-home styling routine. How you style your new look at home is entirely up to you. \"Depending on the texture, it can be air-dried with minimal effort,\" says Mestour. If you want to give it a more polished look, a few passes with a straightener or curling iron will do the trick. Ahead, keep scrolling to see different modernized takes on the page cut.",

    "title": "How Russian Manicures Make Your Nails Look Photoshopped",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/russian-manicure-48696061",
    "description": "When Kendall Jenner's manicurist Lisa Kon posted a picture of the model's tortoiseshell nails on Instagram back in 2021, one thing stood out even more than her design of choice: the incredibly clean and neat look of her cuticle area. While a clean cuticle line is a prerequisite for any decent manicure, Jenner's, in particular, stood out because it looked like she had almost no cuticle at all, and the effect made her nails look incredibly natural. The secret behind this look, it turns out, is a technique called a russian manicure, and the style has been gaining traction in the US since. Not only has there been an increase in TikTok videos documenting people's experiences with getting russian manicures, but searches for the nail trend have steadily increased over the last few years, and it has become the manicure of choice for people who want their nail extensions to look like they're growing naturally. That said, people are questioning the manicure's safety because of what it takes to get that \"photoshop\" nail look. For one, many dermatologists and manicurists will advise against cutting your cuticles completely (after all, they are there \"to protect the new nail from bacterial and fungal infections as they grow out from the nail root,\" dermatologist Corey L. Hartman, MD, previously told PS). Still, to better understand the popularity of this growing nail trend, we asked celebrity manicurist Elle Gerstein to explain the ins and outs of a russian manicure, as well as what you can expect should you decide to get one. Read ahead for her best tips. Experts Featured in This Article Elle Gerstein is a celebrity manicurist. Corey L. Hartman, MD, is a dermatologist and the founder of Skin Wellness Dermatology in Birmingham, Alabama. What Is a Russian Manicure? This manicure technique actually has very little to do with nail art and everything to do with the nail prep. \"A russian manicure is a technique, not a design,\" Gerstein says. \"The technique involves very extreme and extensive cuticle care [and requires a manicurist] to have almost surgeon-like precision.\" The attention to detail and cuticle cleanup are what differentiate this manicure from others, along with the fact that there is \"no hand filing whatsoever. [All cuticle cleanup] is done with an e-file.\" While russian manicures use both normal and gel polishes, if using a gel, manicurists take extra time to make sure that they properly structure the gel polish on the nail so that it best strengthens the nail bed. Russian Manicure vs Regular Manicure The main difference between a Russian manicure vs a regular manicure is that a Russian manicure is done completely dry and without any water. Traditional manicures typically involve soaking the nails in water in order to soften the cuticles, which are later cut using cuticle scissors. As previously mentioned, Russian manicures remove the cuticle using an e-file. Russian manicures also take longer than a regular manicure.",

    "title": "9 Dermaplaning Tools For That Just-Left-the-Spa Feeling",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/best-dermaplane-razors-49396545",
    "description": "If you're on BeautyTok (aka the beauty side of TikTok), you've probably come across dermaplaning and its skin-smoothing magic in action. Whether you're curious to try it out or unsure about the hype, it's worth knowing the basics. Simply put, \"dermaplaning is an effective way to exfoliate the skin by removing dead skin cells and fine vellus hair (aka peach fuzz) from the face using a dermaplane tool, which is essentially a razor specifically designed for the face,\" says Helen Sung, Head of Global Product Development and Research at Flamingo. \"This technique helps improve skin texture and tone, making it feel smoother and look more radiant.\" Beyond smoother skin, dermaplaning can also help products absorb better and create the perfect base for makeup. \"With the removal of dead skin cells, skin-care products can penetrate the skin more effectively,\" Sung adds. While we tend to be a bit cautious about claims like this before consulting with a medical provider, we checked in with board-certified dermatologist Kristina Collins, MD, who confirmed it to be true. She told PS that it does, indeed, help products \"reach the epidermis more easily,\" and thus, maximizes the impact of your skin-care regimen. As for how to dermaplane? Sung recommends starting with a good cleanse to prep your skin. Then, \"hold skin taut, similar to when using wax strips,\" she advises. \"Use one hand to gently hold the skin taut while using the dermaplaning tool with the other. This reduces the chance of nicks and ensures smoother strokes. Use short, gentle strokes and glide the tool downward at a 45-degree angle.\" Be careful not to apply too much pressure, as that can cause irritation or cuts, and take extra care around delicate areas like the nose and mouth. Afterward, follow with \"a hydrating serum or moisturizer to soothe and nourish the skin,\" and don't forget to finish with a broad-spectrum sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher, because dermaplaning makes you more sensitive to the sun. Ahead, we've rounded up the nine best dermaplaning tools to consider adding to your skin-care regimen, including everything from disposable and refillable options to value packs and high-tech options.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/katy-perry-qr-code-tattoo-vmas-49392525",
    "description": "Katy Perry made a splash at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards on Sept. 11, and surprisingly, it had nothing to do with her Who Decides War shredded-style bralette, her wet hairstyle, her performance of her greatest hits, or the fact that she received the Video Vanguard Award. Instead, our eyes were glued to - and we couldn't stop thinking about - another tiny detail: her lower back tattoo. While it seemed to be only a temporary addition to Perry's ink collection, the design was decidedly meta, featuring a QR code etched in blank ink that left many people wondering what it goes to. (The placement also seemed like an intentional reclamation of the \"tramp stamp\" trend.) But where did Perry's QR code tattoo link lead to? Keep reading to find out. Where Did Katy Perry's QR Code Tattoo Link Go? We did some digging and discovered that the QR code leads to a pre-save website for Perry's upcoming album, 143. While QR code tattoos aren't especially common these days, the design has been around for some time. However, if you're thinking about getting one for yourself, you should take into account a few things. First and foremost, placement makes a big impact; QR codes should be placed on a body part with a flat surface in order to make sure they can scan properly. You should also consider going to a professional artist who is good with precise tattoos, as well as making sure to keep your ink out of the sun. Also, it's important to note that if the ink distorts over time, the QR code can become difficult to scan, or not scan at all. Renee Rodriguez is a staff writer and social producer for PS.

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find the best things to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.Just because the dark evenings have arrived doesn’t mean we need to be picking Halloween costumes just yet. The recent spring/summer 2025 shows may have had brighter days in mind but the layering, structured outerwear, and bold prints we saw on the runways in New York, London, Milan, and Paris work just as well for fall.In London, Chopova Lowena showcased patterned tights alongside metal hardware and three-quarter-length, snake-print leather jackets. In New York, all eyes were on LaQuan Smith’s military-style shirts, translucent trench coats, and oxblood feathered jackets. And was there anyone who didn't go weak at the knees for Saint Laurent? The show in Paris brought back the brand founder’s famous tailored look with 1980s-style shoulder pads, polka dot ties, and heavy leather bomber jackets.When it came to beauty, Tolu Coker made the case for 1960s glamour at her London Fashion Week show, with models donning voluminous beehives and graphic black and white eyeliner with diffused corners. Harris Reed went one step further with full doll eyes complete with long, sticky lashes and warm, golden bronze eyeshadows. But it was perhaps Luar who best channeled the vampiness of the season with glossy black lips and exaggerated brows.If all that isn’t enough inspiration for the season ahead, we’ve got plenty of new launches on our radar which are sparking our imagination this October.

Now, the brand is bringing two new dreamy fragrances into the fold, this time with more distinctive personalities. Housed in a crushed grape-colored bottle, You Rêve is all about sweet warmth with notes including buttercream, toasted almond and plum butter alongside spicy sandalwood. For those in search of something less fruity, You Doux is the sophisticated older sister scent, offering a softer mix of notes. Blending earthy palo santo, frankincense and sweet violet, the perfume delivers a musky woodiness that’s perfect for fall. Both fragrances are vegan and cruelty-free.Shop now at GlossierGlossier Glossier You Rêve, $, available at GlossierUGG New Heights CollectionIt’s officially “boots with the fur” season, which makes UGG’s latest platform footwear perfectly timed. Featuring the brand’s first-ever heeled designs, the New Heights collection adds a touch of glamour to the everyday with a range of heel heights across classic and new silhouettes. The stand-out for sure is the Xtra Boot, a full suede, knee-high design that we wouldn’t be shocked to see Sabrina Carpenter wearing on her upcoming Christmas special. If you’re searching for something more subtle, there’s also an ultra mini low boot with a 1.5\" heel height and a range of heeled cozy clogs in neutral colorways that could rival the Tasman’s popularity. Catch us looking cozy (and tall) in this collection throughout fall.Shop now at UGGUgg New Heights Platform Xtra, $, available at UggBebe x CiaraDespite being a nostalgic brand for many, Bebe continues to be discovered by new generations: The label is currently all over TikTok thanks to its diamanté Y2K spaghetti tops and fitted hoodies. It continues to innovate, this season tapping pop/R\u0026B icon Ciara as creative director for a capsule collection. While many of the looks are ready for center stage (the leopard-print catsuit is giving serious Scary Spice vibes), there are plenty of casual date-night pieces. However, if what you want this season is to be toasty and talked about, look no further than the head-turning, faux-fur olive maxi coat.Shop now at BebeBebe x Ciara Faux Fur Maxi Coat, $, available at bebeDr Dennis Gross DermInfusions Blur + Repair CreamWe all know that colder weather can lead to dry, inflamed skin, which is why a nourishing moisturizer is a must come autumn. Luckily, dermatologist Dr Dennis Gross has expanded the DermInfusions line just in time for the mercury to drop, launching a new Blur and Repair Cream that delivers serious hydration. Containing rich shea butter and skin barrier-boosting ceramides, the cream aims to improve elasticity while hydrating hyaluronic acid and skin-strengthening peptides draw in moisture, leaving a plump and glowing base for makeup application. The formula is non-comedogenic, too, so it’s less likely to cause breakouts.Shop now at SephoraDr. Dennis Gross DermInfusions™ Blur + Repair Cream, $, available at SephoraDaily Paper x ConverseDaily Paper, which started out in Amsterdam in 2012, celebrates African culture through its luxurious pieces boasting monogram prints.

The 16-piece collection experiments with tailoring and layering through fall-ready pieces like quilted jackets, skirts over pants, sweaters with armholes, and a combo bustier/button-front top.

That’s where Starface’s new recovery patches enter the picture. While the brand’s famous yellow stars aim to shrink spots, the new purple patches are designed to soothe inflammation after an (ill-advised) picking sesh. Containing soothing aloe vera and vitamin A to promote cell turnover, the recovery stars are all about bringing down redness fast. With the addition of licorice root to help with scarring, these patches put in the work to heal skin and get rid of the evidence.Shop now at StarfaceStarface hydro-star® recovery, $, available at StarfacePleasing x Disney Fantasia Revel in the nostalgic magic of the 1940s animated classic Fantasia with Pleasing’s latest collaboration.

Find three nail polish sets (each of which borrows cues from different segments of the movie), a new edition of the Big Lip HA Moisture Balm, hoodies, tote bags, and more. “When visiting the Disney archives, we had the opportunity to look through lots of archived and special illustrations which was very exciting — especially as a child who went to the Disney parks — getting a peek behind the curtains of how these beautiful movies and moments are made felt truly inspiring,” Pleasing creative director Harry Lambert said, in a press release. “From very early on, Fantasia was always in the front of our minds at Pleasing; the aesthetics, the mood, the bold illustrations, the colors, and, ultimately, the epic world that Disney has created, were very much a world that resonated with Pleasing.” Prices range from $25 to $289.Shop now at PleasingPleasing x Disney Fantasia L’Apprenti Sorcier Tote in Blue, $, available at PleasingREFY Plum Lip CollectionThe onset of autumn might have some people thinking of sunset-colored trees, cinnamon drinks, and baked pumpkin goods; for us, it’s all about the arrival of vampy makeup. A wine-stained lip is arguably the most sophisticated makeup trend for this time of year and REFY is joining the party with a brand-new, plum-hued lip combo. Comprising a dome-shaped Blur Liner and tinted lip gloss, the kit lends a plummy ombre effect that can be diffused by day and built up for a statement look come cocktail hour.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Have you ever loved a fragrance so much, you wish it came in shower gel, candle, body lotion, and even car freshener form? Well I feel this way about Ellis Brooklyn’s Vanilla Milk — a perfume that marries two types of comforting vanilla with lush rose, moreish frangipani and creamy milk. If you’re just as obsessed, you’ll understand my excitement when I tell you that the brand has expanded its fan-favorite scent. Introducing the Vanilla Milk Shimmering Scented Body Oil. It’s equally as incredible as the OG fragrance but now with heaps of added champagne sparkle — and I predict a sell-out. “I’ve always thought of Vanilla Milk as wonderfully indulgent,” Ellis Brooklyn founder Bee Shapiro exclusively tells Refinery29. “There’s a feeling to the scent that reminds me of fall or winter pampering. I wanted to capture that in a champagne shimmer formula that mimicked our box packaging — and also felt festive.”  Ellis Brooklyn Vanilla Milk Shimmering Scented Body Oil, $70 We’ve seen a few of our favorite fragrance brands launch body oil versions of beloved scents as of late, and it makes total sense: Not only do body oils moisturize the skin deeply, but they are often a more affordable way to try a scent before committing to a full-size eau de parfum. Ellis’ Vanilla Milk was already a personal favorite of mine (not to mention, a 2022 R29 Beauty Innovator Award winner), and as a child of the 2000s, I have a bit of a soft spot for shimmery body products (especially ones that smell like dessert). But lest you expect chunky, see-it-from-space glitter, think again: Ellis’ Vanilla Milk Shimmering Scented Body Oil bestows a hint of super-fine shimmer that reads as more of a glow enhancer than body highlighter. “I think shimmer can look flattering at a holiday party but also equally at a pool party,” Shapiro tells us. (Facts!) As for the process of transforming an existing scent from an alcohol base to an oil one, Shapiro reveals that the journey of keeping the scent consistent was less challenging than you may think. “The Vanilla Milk scent actually lives better in a non-alcoholic base,” she explains — perfect for those who want a longer-lasting fragrance. “If you smell a lactonic [milky or creamy] scent too early after spraying a perfume, you may get turned off by what people say are ‘sour’ notes. If you wait a few seconds, the alcohol will evaporate and you’re left with a gorgeous creamy fragrance.”  And she’s right: As soon as I applied the oil, it blossomed into a delicious gourmand (comforting and sweet but not saccharine) that lingered on my skin — and for a surprisingly long amount of time. I applied it in the morning and could still smell it when I took an afternoon shower. I love wearing it alone on my arms, legs, and chest, or layered with another scent for more impact. (For a recent date, I added a few spritzes of Gucci Flora Gorgeous Orchid Eau de Parfum, a vanilla-floral that paired perfectly with Ellis’ romantic and sensual Vanilla Milk.) Ellis Brooklyn’s Vanilla Milk Shimmering Scented Body Oil launches October 7 and retails for $70 for a 3.2 fluid-ounce bottle. (In comparison, the 1.7 fl. oz eau de parfum goes for $110, so it’s not a bad deal at all.) And while it’s too early to call, we’re willing to bet that this will be a highly-coveted gift for all the beauty lovers who have been good this year.  Like what you see?

    "title": "I Tried This New Perfume — \u0026 Received So Many Compliments",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dkny-24-7-fragrance-nyc-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": ".primisslate { display: none !important; } All of the things you know about New York City are true: it’s crowded, it’s fast-paced, it’s thrumming with energy. And it’s true of the residents who live there: they’re busy, they’re never not on-the-go, they’re unfailingly preoccupied with whatever they have going on in their lives. I take comfort in this great NYC paradox — to be surrounded by others, to experience this unsaid collective belonging even when you’re utterly alone. So, as someone who’s lived here for more than a decade, I know it takes a lot to break that barrier, broach a complete stranger, and burst the bubble in which we all separately exist.   As it turns out, sometimes, it only takes one thing: DKNY’s newest 24/7 fragrance. The first time it happened was during my morning commute to Industry City in Brooklyn (the site of R29’s newly minted headquarters). I had walked maybe five or so steps from the subway station when I heard an “Excuse me.” It was loud, it was from a man, and it disrupted the usual din of early a.m. transit. But I kept walking until there it was again — “Excuse me” — though this time, it was accompanied by a tap on my shoulder. I flinched and turned around, only to find a tall-ish guy who sheepishly inquired, “What perfume are you wearing?” He wanted to gift it to his girlfriend for her birthday. I watched as he carefully, deliberately typed it into his notes app on his phone, in awe at the immense power that a fragrance holds. Or at least, this particular fragrance. I’ll be honest: I was genuinely very curious about this perfume. It was created by Frank Voelkl, principal perfumer at DSM Firmenich, to encapsulate the complexity, the vibrancy, the limitless possibilities of NYC and distill it into a singular scent. Voelkl landed on a scent that boasts a “textural floral with a woody and musky background.” The fragrance is composed of top notes of pink pepper blended with rhubarb to capture the energy of the city. It evolves in the middle in a full, rich floral bouquet of rose centifolia, tuberose, and jasmine sambac. It ends with a warm trail made of upcycled cedarwood and sandalwood.  I don’t normally wear fragrances, but that morning, I picked up the new DKNY 24/7 fragrance — I love the super-sleek chrome hourglass-shaped bottle (to connote the continuous flow of time) that’s luxuriously hefty in weight — and spritzed it on both of my wrists. And then my neck. And then all over. It’s a captivating blend of contradictions: bold yet subtle, sweet yet spicy, sensual yet powerful. The second time I was stopped was at the office. On my way out of a conference room, an editor from another team told me she couldn’t stop smelling me during the meeting. “Not to be a creep or anything,” she said before we both laughed.  The third and fourth (and fifth and sixth) times happened in quick succession. I met up with a friend to attend a press preview of a pop-up installation in SoHo, where with every hi and every hug, I was given a compliment. There were a lot of “Oooh you smell nice,” “I love your perfume,” and “I’m looking for a new signature scent.” The DKNY 24/7 scent lasted all day, but the fragrance I spritzed in the morning wasn’t the same as the one that lingered on my skin at night. By the time I arrived home, it had evolved into a quieter, “my skin but better” scent, with the base notes shining through: warm and sensual with a hint of spice. It had faded, yes, but it assumed a different, albeit still beautiful form.  The beauty of a fragrance is its ability to forge an olfactory memory so powerful, it can transport you to a specific time or location. In this case, with DKNY 24/7, that place is New York City. And now, whenever I smell it, I’m reminded of my day-to-day life in the city I love, the city I call home.  Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. A couple of months ago, I was at the store picking up toothpaste and realized the oral care section now looks more like your average skincare aisle. Sure, there were the typical tubes of Colgate and Crest, but also beautifully designed electric toothbrushes and curvy bottles of mouthwash that reminded me of sleek beauty tools and fancy body products. And, hold on — was that a teeny-tiny vial of tooth serum? I left that day with a lot of questions (along with a fresh tube of toothpaste) and wondered, as we’ve witnessed the “skinification” of hair and body care…is oral hygiene next? Maintaining healthy teeth and gums is one thing, but unsurprisingly, many of the products in the tooth beautification space zero in on whitening – arguably the most popular cosmetic concern when it comes to your smile. Whitening toothpaste, strips, and other systems have long been popular choices for at-home use, but as I did more research, I found brands like Moon Oral Beauty (Kendall Jenner previously served as the brand’s face and also launched a whitening pen in collaboration with Moon in 2021), but also beauty brands that dabbled in tooth care. Tarte has a whitening pen called Pearly Girl, which has quietly racked up hundreds of positive reviews, and Glossier teamed up with Marvis on a limited-edition holiday kit last year. Hismile’s Glostik Tooth Gloss looks just like a tube of shimmery pearl gloss but is meant to be applied on teeth for a natural yet noticeable bright gleam. Oh, and purple toothpaste — based on the same color theory concept that violet neutralizes yellowish, brassy tones — is becoming a thing. “I believe that a beautiful smile starts with a healthy foundation, so I first focus on ensuring that all aspects of oral health are in optimal condition,” Dr. Garrett Worsey, DDS of Apa Aesthetic Los Angeles tells Refinery29. “[Tooth serums and glosses] are part of an exciting trend in oral care; these products usually have ingredients designed to enhance the appearance of teeth, such as brighteners or enamel protectants.” However, Worsey is quick to note that these products are meant to be a compliment, not a replacement for practicing healthy oral hygiene. “Essential components of a healthy oral care routine are twice daily brushing with a re-mineralizing toothpaste, daily flossing, and of course, professional dental check-ups.” But…why teeth? For starters, there’s big money in pearly whites. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global oral care market was estimated at $33.63 billion in 2024 and is projected to swell to $46.52 billion by 2032. As for the glosses, serums, and varnishes…what’s actually making a difference, and what’s just stuff for stuff’s sake? It’s not sexy, but the core of any healthy routine is twice-a-day brushing (preferably with an electric toothbrush), daily flossing (either manual or accompanied with a tool like Waterpik), and depending on your concerns, a fluoride mouthwash. If we dig deeper, an argument can be made that a megawatt smile is the new status symbol — and that brands are looking to capitalize on the moment; my FYP is flooded with celebs’ picture-perfect Chiclet pearly whites — almost certainly the work of veneers, the immaculately crafted, porcelain tooth coverings totaling in the tens of thousands of dollars. I’ve witnessed the normalization of Botox, fillers, and plastic surgery become commonplace brunch table fodder. I wonder if maybe within a few years (or sooner), we’ll be asking the group chat not about the latest episode of Love Island but about getting our teeth done. While I’d argue that the concept of “oral beauty” is simply building upon what dentists have been preaching for years — and repackaged for the TikTok generation — my consensus is that having a beauty routine for your chompers wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world. One, it encourages healthy habits, and two, it might even bring you joy (I mean, Hello Kitty electric toothbrushes tend to have that effect, no?). “Walking around with a smile that you’re confident in can truly be life-changing, and this all begins with a good ‘oral beauty’ routine,” says Worsey. “Maintaining excellent oral hygiene is the foundation, but enhancing your smile with aesthetic treatments can really take your overall appearance and confidence to the next level. The absolute best part of my job is seeing this transformation in my patients’ lives once they finally have the smile they’ve always wanted.” Like what you see?

    "description": "The leaves are starting to turn red, and there’s a hint of chill in the air, which means it’s time to swap out your breezy summer perfumes for something that feels a bit more snuggly. This time of year calls for fragrances that wrap you up like a cashmere sweater — think warm and enveloping amber, restorative woody scents and a touch of sweet, comforting vanilla. Cherry perfumes and tobacco notes also tend to get a boost in popularity around the fall.Lucky for us (and you), a fresh collection of fall-inspired perfumes has just hit the shelves, many of them doing a fabulous job at bottling up the perfect autumn day, a steamy mug of apple cider optional. Our editors have spritzed their way through all these new releases to present you with a list of perfumes that will instantly get you in the mood for fall, no matter your budget. Whether you’re into spicy, warm scents that evoke long naps by the fireplace or a classic vanilla perfume that will linger on your scarf for days, we’ve got you covered. We’ll be updating this story with more tried-and-tested feedback as more new scents are dropped, so make sure to keep this one bookmarked.At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

It’s a challenge to find perfumes and candles that don’t make me feel ill, so I’m constantly on the hunt for warm, woodsy scents that aren’t too pungent. I was eager (and nervous) to try Ariana Grande’s Lovenotes Pink Woods — and I’m in love.“The perfume smells bright and sparkly at first spray, thanks to the Italian bergamot and lotus flower, but it turns warmer and muskier as it sits on my skin (that would be the vetiver and cashmere woods talking). The fragrance reminds me more of a cologne, which I tend to prefer, but there are hints of sweet candy, which makes sense, as there are notes of cotton candy in it. This one feels more mature and luxurious than Grande’s earlier fruity and floral fragrances. Most importantly, it doesn’t irritate my sense of smell or give me a headache.” — Victoria Montalti, associate fashion writerShop UltaAriana Grande Lovenotes Pink Woods Eau de Parfum, $, available at UltaHermès Barénia Eau de Parfum“Barénia is the first chypre scent (think a citrus-mossy-woody hybrid) by Hermès. This new perfume takes inspiration from its namesake, a type of high-quality leather used in the most iconic bags from the luxury fashion house. I haven’t liked a single leather-inspired perfume in the past, so I wasn’t 100% sure I’d enjoy this. However, just one sniff is enough to change my mind: The patchouli tickles my nose and harmonizes with the oaky base note to create a soft leather-like aroma. It conjures memories of my vintage leather bomber jacket, one of my prized possessions.“The leathery notes fade away quite quickly, and you’re left with a cloud of tart berries and sweet butterfly lilies that drifts around you for the rest of the day. If you’re looking for a cozy signature fragrance for the winter, you can’t go wrong with Barénia. The striking bottle design, created to resemble an Hermès calfskin stuffed bracelet, makes this a certified collector’s item.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop NordstromHermès Barénia Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromSol de Janeiro Cheirosa 76 Perfume Mist“Often super sweet, fruity, and playful, most Sol de Janeiro fragrances skew much younger to me, as someone in her early thirties. But consider Cheriosa 76 the fragrance family’s chic older sister. She’s still fun and full of energy (that’ll be the zingy blackcurrant), but she’s also sophisticated and put-together (the creamy jasmine, heady freesia, and skin-like amber woods make sure of that.) Starting at $24 for a mini bottle, it’s considerably cheaper than the fragrances on this list, but it boasts brilliant staying power. It gets warmer and more comforting as you wear it in, making it the perfect autumn perfume if you’re on a budget.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, deputy beauty directorShop SephoraSol de Janeiro Cheirosa 76 Perfume Mist, $, available at SephoraMarc Jacobs Perfect Elixir Eau de Parfum“I normally don’t associate fruity perfumes with autumn, but Marc Jacobs’ latest addition to the Perfect Eau de Parfum lineup has managed to surprise me. Perfect Elixir greets you with the sweet and tart aroma of plums, which happen to be in season during the early months of fall. The scent then warms up with cozy amber and vanilla bean accords, while rhubarb and patchouli add a dash of crispness. It reminds me of a plum and almond tart — the perfect autumnal dessert — but it doesn’t smell overly saccharine on the skin, thanks to delicate orange blossoms in the middle notes. It’s a very grown-up but still flirty version of a vanilla scent that has impressive staying power, but you’ll be tempted to reapply even way before it fades.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop UltaMarc Jacobs Perfect Elixir Eau de Parfum, $, available at UltaGivenchy L'Interdit Absolu Eau de Parfum Intense“This new scent is my absolute favorite out of Givenchy’s ever-growing L’Interdit perfume range. The jasmine in the other variations is quite pungent, which can be polarizing to some people. Givenchy L’interdit Absolu presents you with a white floral bouquet that is much softer, creamier (thanks to the combo of neroli, lavender, and cardamom) — and a little bit boozy, due to the addition of rum. It’s also enriched with tobacco absolute that warms up the scent and lends a soft smokiness, making the wearer feel more sexy and enticing. Compared to the OG version, L'Interdit Absolu sits closer to the skin, creating a more intimate experience overall.” — Eudora Nwasike, certified fragrance specialist by the Fragrance FoundationShop UltaGivenchy L'Interdit Absolu Eau de Parfum Intense, $, available at UltaDedCool Aura Eau de Parfum“Fuelled by top notes of pear and lemon, DedCool Aura is layered with middle notes of jasmine and patchouli, which dry down to bottom notes of musk, caramel, and vanilla. The resulting cocktail is bright and juicy, sparkly but mature, and thick and luxurious — but never headache-inducing. It’s an exquisite, nostalgic balance between sweet and herby, and it’ll wrap you with warmth on cold, rainy days. It has all the makings of a ‘signature’ perfume that all of your friends and acquaintances will associate you with from here on out.” — Humeara Mohamed, contributing writerShop DedCool DedCool Aura Eau de Parfum, $, available at DedcoolJo Malone Hinoki \u0026 Cedarwood Cologne Intense“I was recommended this scent because I don’t like sweet, gourmand perfumes, and this is basically the opposite. It’s true: Hand me a cherry perfume, and my nose will instantly wrinkle. This, then, sounds perfect on paper. Inspired by the Japanese ritual of ‘forest bathing,’ it’s studded with tree-like notes, including Japanese hinoki cypress (which smells a bit like eucalyptus) and cedarwood. As someone who spends 99% of their time in lakes and green spaces, it sounds right up my street, and, at first spritz, it really is.“The initial smell is super fresh, but elevated, like a posh laundry detergent, in the best way. You begin to notice the woody elements a little more as it dries down, and this is where things get complicated. The clash of fresh and woody notes makes it smell a little too home spray-like. It’s a lovely scent, but perhaps a little too piney for my skin. I’d love this in a candle; I prefer something softer and more suggestive in a fragrance. However, if your preference is strong and heady fragrances that last all day, this will be a winner.” — Humeara Mohamed, contributing writerShop NordstromJo Malone Hinoki \u0026 Cedarwood Cologne Intense, $, available at NordstromINITIO Parfums Privés Atomic Rose Hair Perfume“I’ve been on the lookout for a signature hair scent for years. As a petite girlie, I’m convinced that lovely-smelling hair is a great way to make an impactful first impression since most people tower over me and can only see the top of my head. With these new hair mists by INITIO, I’ve landed on the hair fragrance of my dreams. These perfumes are alcohol-free, which means they won’t dry out your ends, while panthenol (vitamin B5) moisturizes the hair and makes it shinier without weighing it down.“Atomic Rose is my favorite out of the range: it casts a veil of jasmine, rose, bergamot, and vanilla that stays on my hair, and I’m hooked on the luxurious floral scent. I keep holding the ends of my hair for a sniff throughout the day, and every person who has hugged me has complimented my smell. It’s still an investment at $91, but the price point is significantly lower than the eau de parfum version, which starts at $240.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop NordstromINITIO Atomic Rose Hair Perfume, $, available at NordstromVictoria’s Secret Daring Eau De Parfum“I have a soft spot for Victoria’s Secret perfumes. I think they are quite good across the board and definitely hold their own against fancy designer ones. The latest launch is named Daring, and even before I smelled it, I knew it would be right up my alley. It’s a crisp, woody scent (two words not usually paired together), and features a unique blend of bergamot, amber, and oakmoss for a complex result — bright and verdant at the beginning, but then dries down to reveal sensual earthy notes. I’ve been loving it for fall, since it feels very feminine and elegant (but not in a granny way), but also a little masculine with its oakiness and hint of edge. It also doesn’t hurt that the bottle is the prettiest pale green hue, which is my favorite color.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writerShop Victoria's SecretVictoria's Secret Daring Eau De Parfum, $, available at Victoria's SecretPenhaligon’s The Dandy Eau de Parfum“I only just received The Dandy and I’m already a quarter of the way through the bottle. In fact, I’m calling it: it’s my new signature scent. I’m obsessed with the 1920s (the haircuts, brooding speakeasies, the infamous parties) and The Dandy is what I imagine every stylish flapper girl smelt like. It opens with a splash of whisky (rich and earthy) then makes way for raspberry (tart and floral) but it’s the notes that remain — creamy, musky, skin-like ambrox, rich oak, spicy cedarwood and intoxicating smoke — that make this so special.“On the dry down, the cocktail-esque notes dissipate, and it transforms into something really soothing. Throughout the day, I catch delicious, delicate plumes of it, like the fragrance is simply an extension of me — like clean, powdery skin. The other day, someone chased me off the train (bear in mind it wasn’t their stop) to ask me which perfume I was wearing. It’s really that memorable.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, deputy beauty directorShop NordstromPenhaligon's The Dandy Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromLike what you see?

    "title": "The Hype Is Real: These 2 Products Gave Me Fuller-Looking Lips",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fuller-lips-makeup-trick?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "For as long as I can remember, my lips have been a source of insecurity. My upper lip is visibly thinner than my lower, and while it’s probably not as noticeable to others as it is to me, my Cupid’s bow is slightly uneven. My awareness of this lack of volume and symmetry dates back to childhood, when I would spend hours poring over the full and flawless lips of the ‘90s supermodels that graced my mother’s magazines — a fixation that led to a failed middle school attempt at wearing lip liner, where I would thickly line and reshape them to poor effect. (The chalky formulas of the early aughts certainly didn’t help my case.) I abandoned my efforts soon after when a friend kindly pointed out that I looked “insane.” Now, in my 30s and so much more self-assured, my feelings toward my lips are less characterized by anxiety, and yet, they still lack a certain something. I wanted gloriously full lips that — and this was important — had to look natural. I had no idea how to achieve this elusive balance.  As it turned out, there was a lot I could do, but none of it would deliver the look I so deeply desired without costing me an arm and a leg (or a full month’s rent). I first considered a lip lift, a permanent surgical procedure that alters the shape and position of the upper lip to make it look fuller. But due to financial constraints (it can cost upward of $6,500!) and a very real fear of going under the knife, I ultimately ruled it out. I also couldn’t justify the $800+ price tag of expertly injected lip filler in NYC, especially given it would require once-to-twice yearly touch-ups. Plus, my Google search turned up enough filler migration photos to turn me off for good. I didn’t completely shy away from the med spa, however. I worked up the courage to try the less expensive but much more temporary lip flip, which uses strategically placed neurotoxin injections to coax your upper lip to flip upward and create subtle fullness. It looked great, but I just couldn’t get behind the whole drooling-on-myself-in-public thing every time I took a sip of my drink. (If you know, you know.) Frustrated, I then turned to a tried-and-true and needle-free method for enhancing your facial features: makeup. I knew that skillfully applied cosmetics could create magic, but I feared that I, a mere mortal who lacks steady hands (please don’t ever ask me to apply winged eyeliner), would struggle…and struggle I did. Despite consuming countless TikTok tutorials on how to masterfully overline your lips to attain that nepo baby-influencer pout, I just couldn’t get it right. I found myself right back where I was at 13: The final product always leaned too harsh or clown-like to wear out of the house, and I found that many lip liner formulas I tried were super drying, tugging on my lips and creating the opposite effect of fullness. That’s when I discovered this genius hack — and the products needed to achieve it. After hearing the sung praises from my beauty writer peers, I got my hands on Maybelline’s Lifter Liner, a deliciously creamy pencil that taught me lip liner doesn’t have to, well, kind of suck. Its hydrating, hyaluronic acid-infused formula glides on smooth as silk and wears incredibly comfortably — no dryness or chalkiness in sight. More importantly, its consistency makes it easy to blend and buff out, something I learned is crucial for creating a seamless, realistic look. All it takes to pull off my dream look is to: start from the center of my lips, slightly overline my natural contours, and then diffuse the color through the center of my lips with the tip of my finger. This creates gorgeous, natural-looking dimension and fullness, no expert skills or fancy tools required. I found that the shade “Out Of Line” is the perfect rosy-taupe that’s slightly darker than my natural lip color, which helps create subtle definition for a “my lips but better” effect. This alone does the trick, but topping it off with the Lifter Gloss really amplifies the overall look. Just a few swipes of hydrating, high-shine formula in the shade “Stone” instantly smoothes my lips, camouflaging any lines or signs of dryness and imparting a fuller-looking, glass-like finish. For a trick this simple, it’s done so much for me and my confidence, because it’s helped me learn to love my lips. It’s not that I ever needed to permanently (or semi-permanently) change them, but a little enhancement goes a long way. Now, it’s become a mainstay in my daily makeup routine, and I leave my house with the fullest, supplest, juiciest lips to date — and it didn’t require any painful procedures or draining my bank account to get there. In fact, I had not one but two friends ask if I had “done something” to my lips on their first public debut. Fortunately for them, I don’t gate-keep. .primisslate { display: none !important; } Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",
