Understanding that they had a workplace fire drill coming up, they listened carefully—a little too carefully—the the instructions over the P.A. system. “If you leave the property during the drill, don't bother coming back.\"Well, well, well, you got it, boss! Perhaps it was the extra dash of sass in their morning cold brew or the audacity of testing the limits, but this employee decided to take this ultimatum and turn it into a half-day at the office!",
