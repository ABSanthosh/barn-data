  "text": "Get to Know His Fluffiness — King Meowrick the MagnificentIn the shimmering heart of Cheezburgia’s capital, where sunbeams pour like honey through stained-glass windows and every breeze carries the scent of salmon mousse, reigns King Meowrick the Magnificent - a Maine Coon of truly majestic proportions.Cloaked in robes of royal velvet, his golden crown set with gleaming rubies, and his resplendent fur fluffed to perfection by an army of loyal groomers, King Meowrick cuts a striking figure upon his towering, pillow-strewn throne. Towering platters of fresh fish flank his dais, and his goblets overflow with cream so rich it could lull a lynx to sleep. His people adore him - for his charm, his grand banquets, his generosity, and his unmatched talent for three-hour naps.But for all his grandeur, King Meowrick’s heart lies not in war councils, but in feasts in the halls. Affairs of state are delegated to his ever-bickering council, and the matters of distant borderlands, such as young Duchess Dander’s quiet duchy, rarely reach his tufted ears.The shadows now stretching across Cheezburgia go unnoticed by the King, and for troubling reasons:👑 He scoffs at the old legends of Basement Cat and the forbidden place known only as The Basement, calling them bedtime stories for misbehaving kittens.👑 From the velvet cocoon of his inner palace, he hears little of unrest, distant though it may be.👑 His court, whether foolish or treacherous, shrugs off reports of creeping darkness as mere exaggeration.👑 And worst of all - Basement Cat’s evil does not march openly, but slinks and slithers in secret, working its corruption from below. So Meowrick lounges, purring in peace atop his castle balcony… unaware that dark omens stir, and a duchess has already begun her journey.Don't Forget to Cast Your VoteThe threads of destiny are woven by many paws - and yours may guide the duchess’s fate.Will her fur gleam like fresh snow, burn like autumn flame, or shine like midnight dark? Will her eyes shimmer with sapphire, emerald, or sunlit gold?Cast your choices wisely, brave adventurer:🐾 Vote on Facebook to choose her fur color🐾 Comment on Instagram to choose her eye colorThe summer adventure begins this August… and the realm awaits your decision.",
