  "description": "Ah, mawwiage. Mawwiage is what brings us togevver, today (this is a Princess Bride reference for all of you clueless as to why we are horribly misspelling 'marriage'). But really though, marriage is a beautiful thing. It's the happiest day of your life, hopefully. It's also a very stressful day. For those of you who are married, you know the craziness that comes on your wedding day. You have a schedule that's packed tighter than a cat in a purrito, there is no margin for error and no time for any distractions.That is, unless, the cat distribution system knocks on your door. Imagine you're getting ready, your hair and makeup are done, you take your two-minute and 30-second break in the schedule to walk around and get some fresh air….and then you hear some meowing. Not just one meow, but four, eight, sixteen meows! Naturally, you investigate. You find four kittens in the venue, so what else can you do except put your wedding on hold and rescue the smol little babies? That's exactly what happened below, so scroll down to watch the whole heartwarming video!",

A wedding can always be rescheduled (or delayed), but kittens only have a few short chances to be rescued. We're happy she saved them and got to get married! Sounds like the best day ever! Her face says it all. We would 100% be shocked and excited at the same time. Four kittens? And look how awwdorable they are. Is this woman real? She kind of seems like a Disney princess. Does this happen to everyone? Or is it a once-in-a-lifetime thing?",
