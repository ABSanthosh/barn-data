  "description": "It's your special day, and you're hoping that everything will go as smoothly as possible. You and your soon-to-be spouse are thrilled as your guests enter the venue and watch you take your marital vows to each other. Then it's time for dinner and dancing late into the night as you celebrate your lifetime of marriage. Well, that's how every couple hopes their wedding day will go, but of course, there are bound to be a few mishaps here and there. Some people hire photographers who don't really know what they're doing, and end up with some botched photos. Others had some bad cake experiences: one person below had a gorgeous white and purple cake covered in flowers. Too bad the icing was too heavy for the cake, and fell right off the cake in a big lump! Then there are sometimes issues with guests. Some of the people you invite to your wedding won't understand or respect the dress code. There's often a teenage boy who insists on wearing basketball shorts instead of a suit, or a woman who needs to be the center of attention, and wears a white gown to the event! There's a lot that can go wrong at a wedding, and you can check out a bunch of examples below. Next, read about these people who are certainly having a worse day than you, like one person who sadly wrote, \"Guess who poured coffee into their cup noodles?\"",
