  "description": "Look, generally speaking, we are not fans of people having wild cats like these as pets. It's a bad idea for a bunch of reasons, but most of all, it's often not good for the cats. There are some exceptions though. Sometimes, when animals cannot be returned back into the wild, we might be their best hope for a good life. Like for the rescued bobcat who fell on its head as a kitten. It couldn't be re-released, but now, we know that his favorite toy is fennel. Or the rescued black panther who was rejected as a cub and got very sick. Now, he has a Rottweiler best friend and is living an awesome life. Or the mountain lion who was injured and could not go back into the wild who now has a loving family and a second chance at happiness. The two Serval kittens in this video were in a similar situation. Unfortunately, their momma rejected them as babies, and if not for these kind people rescuing them, we don't know what their fates would have been. What we do know is that now, they are happy, and that is what really matters.",
