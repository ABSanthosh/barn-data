That's not to say that VBScript code is automatically bad, but the language certainly doesn't help you write clean code. In any case, the previous developer needed to make an 8 element array to store some data. Traditionally, in VBScript, you might declare it like so: Dim params(8) That's the easy, obvious way a normal developer might do it.

Which, when split, creates 8 empty substrings. We make fun of stringly typed data a lot here, but this is an entirely new level of stringly typed initialization. We can only hope that this code has finally been retired, but given that it was still in use well past the end-of-life for Classic ASP, it may continue to lurk out there, waiting for another hapless developer to stumble into its grasp.
