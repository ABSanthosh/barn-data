Now we can consume dozens upon dozens of shrimp each day in all of shrimp’s miraculous forms: Popcorn. Scampi. Cocktail. Tempura. Ceviche—yes, God, ceviche! Never again will I take the fisherman’s platter for granted. Our long, dark night of Butterball is over, and a golden time of shrimp has dawned over America once more!” At press time, 340 million Americans were reportedly in the bathroom and not feeling so well.
