  "description": "When you're a poorly behaved 4-year-old, on the one hand, you're only 4 years old, so you can't really expect to understand the difference between good behavior and right and wrong. But, on the other hand, your parents should be teaching you those things and certainly not encouraging them by giving in to your tiny-fisted, screaming, and crying demands.While no one wants to be \"that person\" and tell someone how to parent their children, and while some children are just uncharacteristically difficult to manage, it's pretty apparent when you have someone in your life who is doing everything wrong. If you have someone like this in your life, then you know exactly what this is like and are probably silently nodding or shaking your head to yourself at this very moment… If you're helping this person with their children, without any form of payment for your time and services nonetheless, it doesn't matter how close you are, if they refuse to work on the things that aren't working for you then by all means you have the right to remove yourself from that situation, which is exactly what this aunt did after she had been babysitting her spolied and destructive nephew in her own home with his parents refusing to recognize or work on any issue.",
