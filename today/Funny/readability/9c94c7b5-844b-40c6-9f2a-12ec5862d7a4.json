  "description": "One of the things that we love the most about cats is how unique each and every one of them is. They each have purrsonalities and quirks and things about them that make them special. Some cats like bread while others don't. Some cats like chilling in sinks while others don't. Some cats lock us out of rooms whenever they don't feel like hanging out with us. We don't know how. We didn't know they had the capability. All we know is that it has happened. More than once. And this is true for all cats, not just house cats who grew up around humans and have learned things from us. Stray cats have the exact same level of quirky personality, to the point that they recognize people, and there are people that they like and people that they don't like. And the cat in today's video has definitely chosen a favorite human, if the way he greets him every time they meet is anything to go by.",
