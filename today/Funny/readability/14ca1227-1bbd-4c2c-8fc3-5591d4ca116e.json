  "description": "It's important to understand that \"fair\" is not always going to mean \"equal.\" And this is one of the most difficult things to get right about parenting, especially when it comes to the opportunities offered to each of your children. You need to recognize the individual needs of each child, which includes helping them where they fall short and fostering in the areas they're interested.For instance, with this mother, who, after moving to a new city with her son and daughter to be closer to her aging parent, offered each of her children a chance to \"rent\" their room to her to work from for her hybrid working arrangement a couple of times a week. While her son quite aggressively declined, her daughter happily took her up on the offer, meaning that the $60 hybrid working allowance that the mother was receiving went straight to her daughter's pocket. Her son, now frustrated that he wasn't receiving a similar payment, complained about how unfair the situation was, sparking a feud in the family, with the mother's mother (her kid's grandmother) siding with the teenage boy.",

  "text": "She can't exactly pay her son for nothing after he turned down the chance of \"renting out\" his room to his mother as an office space, the daughter is being paid for the sacrifice of her privacy, and, well, the son isn't. And it would now be unfair to the daughter if he received the money at no cost.Moving to a new city as a teenager and leaving all your friends behind isn't an easy thing to do, so the teen deserves some patience and understanding. Maybe a little pocket money would do him some good and help him to feel like he can go out and do things on his own in the place where they now live. Given the structure of the family in its current state, it would be fair to give him some chance at income. Being given a \"job\" by his mother, as some have suggested, might just give him the motivation and distraction her needs to make things better overall for everyone.",
