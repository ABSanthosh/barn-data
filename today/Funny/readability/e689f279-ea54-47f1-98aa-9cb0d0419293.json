  "text": "Published: February 25, 2025 ITHACA, NY—Noting that the evolutionary quirk results in plenty of familial strife, herpetologists at Cornell University confirmed Tuesday that shingleback lizards are the only reptiles that mate for the sake of their aging mothers. “Unlike other lizards, the shingleback seeks out a partner to reproduce with as a means to stop the constant haranguing from its mother,” lead researcher Alonso Gentry told reporters, adding that the short-tailed reptiles most often find a suitable mate via dates set up by their mothers. “A shingleback lizard may be single for years, despite its mother’s objections, but eventually it gets sick of hearing about how she’ll die of a broken heart if she doesn’t get grandbabies soon. The lizard is then likely to enter into a relationship that may not be healthy just to stop the complaining. A few months later, it gives birth to its offspring and is saddled with a deep bitterness that its life is over.” Gentry went on to add that shinglebacks have the highest suicide rate of any lizard species.
