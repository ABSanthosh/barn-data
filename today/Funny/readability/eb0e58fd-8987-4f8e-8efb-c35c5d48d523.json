  "description": "Roommate living is not for the weak. The worst part of not living alone is being on other folks' timing. What do I mean by this? Well, having to abide by the rules of your roommates, no matter how small or outrageous their wishes may seem. Are you the unruly roommate? Or, are you like the user in this story who feels like they're under a constant microscope in their home? You've read about food thieves and roommates with cleaning aversions, but this story takes the STEAK.The story poster explains that she went to turn the oven on in her apartment to cook some food. Lo and behold, her roommate was storing and marinating a steak in the bottom rack of the oven and failed to mention this to her. Instead of understanding, the roommate got irrationally angry but still refused to be paid back (the poster insisted she do so). Now, the internet is convincing her she shouldn't go out of her way to give her roomie the money back because her roomie had no right to be upset at her for her own misstep. Commenters are \"forbid[ding]\" her from coughing up the cash. What do you think? Scroll to read the entire story.",
