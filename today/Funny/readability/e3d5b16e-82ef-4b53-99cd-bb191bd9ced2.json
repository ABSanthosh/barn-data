  "description": "Living in a co-op certainly has its advantages, but it also means that you may or may not be at the mercy of a building Karen.Here, we have a new tenant who just moved into her co-op in noisy midtown Manhattan two weeks prior. She threw a small housewarming get-together with ten people on a Friday night. These are all folks in their late twenties or early thirties who knew that this was a quiet, low-key event rather than some kind of rager. Unfortunately for the Redditor who hosted the event, she would have to deal with the building Karen who insisted that they were being too loud despite no complaints from other residents and repeated attempts to maintain a respectful level of noise. Plus, as we mentioned, they live in a noisy part of the city that is naturally way busier and louder, so you would think the Karen would be accustomed to a little activity.Keep scrolling below for the full saga and to see what happened the following morning when the resident caught the building Karen loitering outside her apartment.
