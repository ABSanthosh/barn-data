  "description": "One of the most wonderful things about cats is they love to be pawrents. Cats will adopt just about anything that needs a meowther and/or father figure, including otters, bunnies, and even puppies! We, as hoomans, could learn a thing or two from their generosity. We could also learn a thing or two about their gracefulness, but that's a whole different listicle. Anyway, there's no better example than this story below featuring a kitten, an even smaller kitten, and a pawrent who got bamboozled into 2x the cuteness.We, more so than most people, understand the commitment of owning cats. The more cats you have, the more commitment it is (until you reach about four, then it's all kind of the same), so we understand it when people say they only want one cat. But after rescuing a tiny void baby and bringing it home, their cat decided to adopt it despite the pawrent's wishes to rehome it. And we all know that what the cat wants, the cat gets.
