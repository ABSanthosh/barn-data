  "description": "The real estate market is always so crazy. The ups and downs are always all over the place. So many people, these days, tend to rent. These guys are called tenants and they have a landlord they have to pay every month. Usually the landlord is the homeowner. And sometimes these landlords can be greedy and lazy—they want the most passive income they can get with the least amount of effort put in. So they hire a property management company that takes care of their homes for them! Sometimes this can be great news and you get a very helpful management company. Sometimes, you get a shady one that is just as greedy and lazy as the landlord. This is when rent skyrockets for houses that feel like they're already one foot in the grave. Usually, when you get a bad management company, that means there is something shady going on within its own ranks. Take this employee, for example—he worked at a property management company and immediately was able to sniff out that his higher ups weren't doing the right thing.",
