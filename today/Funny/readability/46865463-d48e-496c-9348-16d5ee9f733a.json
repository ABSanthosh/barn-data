  "text": "This Monday, the Supreme Court kicked off  its new term. Here is a selection of some of the most consequential issues the court can be expected to rule on over the coming months. Metabolic disease as proof of citizenship: The Supreme Court will be reviewing the constitutionality of a new Louisiana bill requiring voters to eat three pounds of refined sugars. Fair lunchroom trade: Tackling a geopolitical issue, all eyes are on the justices whether a Doritos are a fair trade for PB\u0026J. Jimmy Carter: The court is likely to deny the ex-president’s most recent plea for death.  What nation should have for dinner: Both sides of the political aisle are in a heated debate over Chinese v. Italian.  Cowboys v. Giants: The nation’s highest court is expected to decide the Week 12 matchup. Joy: The court will decide if subtle moments of unadulterated bliss are allowed to weave gently through your days. Student loans: The court will rule whether or not everyone’s student loan debt should be doubled just because. Bobby Flay v. Giada De Laurentiis: Food Network has enlisted the SCOTUS to determine which chef can cook up the most enticing spaghetti bolognese. Whether Clarence Thomas is the specialist little guy in all the land: He is, but it won’t be official until it’s written in complicated legalese.",
