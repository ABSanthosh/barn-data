  "text": "Grey DeLisle snapped a shot of Bobby’s new look and bio at the ‘King of the Hill’ wrap party Fifteen years after what used to be the King of the Hill series finale, Bobby Hill has turned his savant-like knowledge of all things food into a career — but don’t tell Hank about the soot under his son’s fingernails.When King of the Hill co-creator Greg Daniels announced that he and his creative partner Mike Judge decided to implement a nine-year time jump in the upcoming Hulu reboot of their Texas-sized slice-of-life sitcom, fans had innumerable questions about how this would change the King of the Hill canon. After all, Arlen spent 12 years and 13 seasons frozen in the floating timeline, so a jump-cut to the current day when Hank and Peggy have gray hair and Bobby is a post-pubescent professional chef is going to be a major adjustment for a fandom that expected Bobby to be a 12-year-old meat inspection prodigy forever. Don't Miss Back in May, Pamela Adlon revealed that, in the King of the Hill revival, Bobby Hill will be a 21-year-old professional chef. Then, late yesterday, voice actress Grey DeLisle posted a current headshot and detailed bio of the grown-up Bobby from the King of the Hill wrap party than showed a stubbly and surprisingly svelte grill master whose methods will have his father saying, “That man ain’t right.” “Chef Bobby Hill has loved food his whole life,” Bobby’s bio reads. “From weeknights around the dinner table eating his mom’s ‘Spa-Peggy and Meatballs,’ to overindulging in lutefisk at church potlucks, to celebrations with family and friends at Luly’s Cafeteria, food and the people it’s enjoyed with are the foundation for his best memories. In fact, his career as a robata chef was inspired by his most cherished memory of all — weekends spent grilling with his dad. “A self-taught chef and one of the youngest contestants on King of the Grill, Chef Hill believes ‘good food can solve any problem.’ He draws on the influences of his childhood by combining classic Texas dishes with flavors from around the world. With Robata Chane, Chef Hill hopes to honor the art of Japanese robata and the German heritage of the Texas Hill Country while pushing culinary boundaries through his innovative fusion dishes.”As fans in the King of the Hill subreddit pointed out, the revival writers have already planted the seeds for conflict between Bobby and Hank in this bio — the Japanese cooking method of robatayaki, often shortened to robata, is a technique similar to barbecue where the chef exclusively cooks the food over hot charcoal, the most filthy and unholy of barbecue fuels.With the double-whammy of Japanese culture and charcoal, this might have been the one time Hank and Cotton could have been united in their disgust.
