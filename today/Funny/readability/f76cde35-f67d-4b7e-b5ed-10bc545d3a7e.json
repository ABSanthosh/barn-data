  "text": "Published: January 16, 2025 LOS ANGELES—In a chaotic scene that saw young people screaming and ducking for cover in the moments after the hip-hop star was served from a passing vehicle, witnesses confirmed Thursday morning that Kendrick Lamar had been hit with a drive-by summons outside an L.A. nightclub. “It all happened so fast—one minute Kendrick was standing around talking with his friends, and the next he was on the ground with a stack of papers covering his chest,” said club owner Mark Rogers, noting that when they saw its tinted window rolling down, Lamar’s bodyguards dove in front of the black Escalade that delivered the documents, but they were unable to prevent the “Not Like Us” rapper from receiving the notice to appear in court. “I always get a bad feeling when I see rappers hanging around my club with highly paid lawyers, because it seems like the lawsuits and countersuits could break out at any moment. I just wish they could make music in peace without fear of legal action.” At press time, security was said to have been tightened outside Drake’s Toronto mansion following reports that attorneys from a white-shoe law firm had been spotted in the neighborhood.
