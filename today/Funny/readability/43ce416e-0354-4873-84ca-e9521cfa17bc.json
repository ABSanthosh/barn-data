  "description": "Every employee needs to draw their boundaries with coworkers. Sometimes, you get along with folks well enough that you're more than fine hanging out outside the office. However, other employees prefer a strict separation between work and life, and regardless of how other people think or feel about it, that decision needs to be respected. Here, we have an employee who had to draw their own boundaries within the work day itself. After a year of spending lunch with coworkers in the break room, he decided to eat alone at his desk moving forward because of strange, aggressive comments from the office Karen. Unfortunately, not only was the employee's choice to eat alone ignored, but the office Karen reprimanded the employee for doing so at a company meeting the very next morning, sparking a completely unnecessary feud.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.
