  "description": "Is there anything more annoying than having to repeat yourself a million times during the job application process? Anyone who has applied to jobs via sites like Indeed or LinkedIn knows that it really does not matter how much information from your resume you put in your personal profile because you are more than likely to have to manually input that information for each application over and over again. If only you could just write \"see resume\" since all the information a recruiter may need is all there. Then, there are cover letters that are most likely used to scan for key words from the job posts to \"see if the candidate is a good fit.\" Clearly, the potential employee believes they check off all the qualifications written in the posting because they are applying for the job anyway. There is simply far too much excessive material \"needed\" for these job applications that are obviously meant to keep the applicant pool small. The reality of the matter is that these recruiters are actively losing potentially great candidates in the process who simply have no desire to repeat themselves a million times before they even get an interview.Keep scrolling below for this applicant's story.
