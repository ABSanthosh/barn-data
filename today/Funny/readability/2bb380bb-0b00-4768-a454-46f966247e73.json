I don’t even mind that she changed it—I just wished the creeping vines weren’t constantly rearranging the maze behind me. It took me four hours to find my bed, and I couldn’t even sleep because of all the whispering ethereal voices. Now I can’t find my way back, and every time I look in a mirror I realize I’ve returned to the beginning. Maybe I just need to tie a rope to myself or something like that.” At press time, sources confirmed Barron was running headlong into the void after hearing a low growl as something gnawed through his rope.
