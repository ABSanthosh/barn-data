Me though: Am I the only one who didn‚Äôt know this? Post navigation 26 thoughts on ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS FRIDAY. LOOK AT THIS DOG.‚Äù Read comments below or add one. your posts from instagram don‚Äôt show up for those of us who don‚Äôt have an account at instagram (That sucks. I think if you click on the links from a computer you can see them even without having an account. ~ Jenny) Nope I don‚Äôt do Instacram either So funny and cute! I especially loved the bear spa and the cats speaking. I think Richard was almost the victim of a peacocknapper! That guy was trying to abscond with Richard! Glad he acted all clumsy and sh*t and fell out of the getaway vehicle! I can‚Äôt breathe!! Every time I watch Richard fall off that seat, I laugh harder!! Thank you so much!! The guy in the third one looks like a younger Wil Wheaton! The talking cats were hysterical! ‚ÄúUh oh!‚Äù was my favorite. Can‚Äôt blame that poor seal, either. My favorite:, the seal on the boat. I also don‚Äôt do Instagram, but‚Ä¶if you leave this website and then reload the page, the videos will usually show up. Also, you can view them once on Instagram (you can view more than once but you have to back out and follow the link again) without having to log in. That seal voice over is hilarious, but I also love the broken toe and the waterslide! Just what I needed, thank you! I haven‚Äôt laughed that much in weeks. I don‚Äôt have Instagram, but I can watch the videos on my Chromebook. My phone is iffy on whether it will let me see them, but I can ALWAYS watch the vids on my Chromebook, if that helps anyone else. Also, my brain keeps telling me today is SATURDAY (which is my Friday), and I am going to be hella sad tomorrow if I forget to go to work. I love your curated collection of videos for us! These hit the spot!! Thank you, Jenny. I really needed your Friday videos after this crazy a** week. And as always, I say ‚ÄúThis is my fave!‚Äù after every one. I laughed, I cried. Perfect! Does anyone else want to be near Pedro Pascal when he feels anxious? Ponies are little shits, and we have children ride them. For those who can‚Äôt watch without an Instagram account‚Ä¶I also do not have one, and sometimes I can‚Äôt see those videos, but often if I restart my PC then I can. I use Chrome for what it‚Äôs worth. It‚Äôs very hit or miss like someone else said, but I can usually eventually see them all here. yep, the instagram videos never work correctly for me either. I can click and watch the first couple (but always have to unmute the sound so miss the beginning), and then it won‚Äôt let me watch anymore without a login. I loved the cats ( I always love cats), but that dog wanting his butt smacked!! üòÇ Like Tammy, I always love the cats. But, the dogs with the little stick had me laughing until I almost choked. The golden bouncing!! I need follow up on that seal on the boat. Just watching the whales circling and swim under the boat was eerie. How Jenny and somebody else‚Äôs mom helped me achieve something today. I don‚Äôt suffer from depression, but I‚Äôve had a few horrific things happen in a short period of time and say hello to my little friend ANXIEEEEEEEETY. On bad weeks it can look like this: need to go grocery shopping. Brain: But what if that horrible thing happens again? Me: It won‚Äôt, but let‚Äôs find something that motivates me. Horrible news in the news, I get triggered and no groceries for two weeks. Today same. In my pj top, managed pants. Sat on my bed. Brain: nopedy nope. So I start web surfing and come across Jenny‚Äôs small happy things and victories posts. The woman and her daughter on the a‚Ä¶hole pony reminded me of a happy memory and something that I overcame when I was a teen as well as the courageous person I used to be. I used to ride competitively. For non horse people: Horses are prey animals evolved to run. Once they panic controlling them is almost impossible even for the most experienced rider. This was a little girl. Overcoming her fear (and trust me getting stuck on anything that gallops 25mph or more is Scary!) with trust because mom was alongside her doing the absolute right thing was so moving. At that speed if the pony had suddenly stopped or bolted off sideways her injuries would have been severe. Young male teen I went to a training school and ended up with a three-year old retired racehorce. Retired??????Hahahaha. Sitting on a racehorse is like sitting on a one ton ballerina who is constantly vibrating en pointe. We went out for a ride through farm country, coach was with us. It was pleasant and relaxing. Small plane overhead, my horse bolts and we end up in a field. My initial I got this turned into OMG I‚Äôm going to die. I tried to calm him, get him to canter in a circle, he ripped the reigns out of my gloved hands with such force that I had blisters the next day. Then he started to buck. Despair and embarrassment. Sitting on enthusiastic killer of things sitting on me, barely hanging on, lost one stirup and creating cropcircles was not going to impress anyone. Then I heard coach: ‚ÄúLET HIM RUN!‚Äù So I did. I trusted. Two useless reigns in my hand, grasped the mane, leaned foward hung on like a monkey eyes watering due to high speed, I let him do what he was bred to do. Run. He did so in a straight line to reach his ‚Äúherd‚Äù (Coach had galloped around the field to meet me). That‚Äôs the person I used to be. That memory came back today. I dressed. Finally went grocery shopping. I did it. THANK YOU, JENNY. Got home realized I‚Äôd forgotten my keys. Small steps people, small steps. Today I‚Äôm Rider. Wow, anonymous horse person. I used to be that kid who would ride anything, and today I‚Äôm an adult who is in hospital with 3 fractured spinal processes (not spinal cord!) ,a cracked rib and a small spleen laceration as the lesson horse I was riding Wednesday was fresh (had been off work 2 weeks) and bolted. As my coach said, he went one way and I went the other‚Ä¶ Good for you for doing the thing. Anxiety disorders are freaking horrible (I have multiple ones‚Ä¶) Rider21: @little wolf. Thank you for your kindness and your support and reading my comment. Yikes, I also wish you a speedy recovery and hope you get back on a horse. Looks like you‚Äôre still riding anything ;). The body heals faster than the mind. My anxiety stems from PTSD and I‚Äôm working on getting the person I used to be back. Yes. anxiety is a #$%5%\u0026!!! Irrational, debilitating, but once the brain starts looping it‚Äôs impossible to make it stop. Focusing on overcoming moments of natural fear in the past helps me overcome irrational fear in the present. Today it worked. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. I wish I knew what happened to that sea lion! I hope he ended up ok. I wouldn‚Äôt have left the boat either! Rider21@ Seal lovers: There are a few vids on YouTube. The seal is probably fine. It‚Äôs illegal to start engines within a certain distance of orca pods, so when this happens people wait an hour the orcas move on, all is well.

It was pleasant and relaxing. Small plane overhead, my horse bolts and we end up in a field. My initial I got this turned into OMG I‚Äôm going to die. I tried to calm him, get him to canter in a circle, he ripped the reigns out of my gloved hands with such force that I had blisters the next day. Then he started to buck. Despair and embarrassment. Sitting on enthusiastic killer of things sitting on me, barely hanging on, lost one stirup and creating cropcircles was not going to impress anyone. Then I heard coach: ‚ÄúLET HIM RUN!‚Äù So I did. I trusted. Two useless reigns in my hand, grasped the mane, leaned foward hung on like a monkey eyes watering due to high speed, I let him do what he was bred to do. Run.
