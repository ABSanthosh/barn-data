  "description": "Weaponized incompetence. Have you heard of this term? It's one of those new-age phrases where we finally put fancy words to something that's been happening since the dawn of time. Weaponized incompetence is when someone performs their inability to complete a task so that the person who asked them to do it just does it anyway, in fear that the other person would do it wrong. Usually, men are weaponizing their incompetence against the women in their lives. To their mothers, their sisters, their wives. But it is most definitely not a gender-exclusive trait. I know I've purposefully done a really bad job at the dishes so my mom wouldn't ask me to do them again. (I do them now, of course…)What happens, though, when the incompetence becomes too much to bear, and the tasks you've taken on keep piling up? That's what one woman is experiencing with her husband here. She's the breadwinner, the bill payer, and on top of everything, she cooks, cleans, and does all the laundry. With her husband not working, they're financially strapped for cash. So when she comes home one day to find him yet again on the couch, she finally flips her lid. Is this a He Had It Coming Moment? Read on to find out.",
