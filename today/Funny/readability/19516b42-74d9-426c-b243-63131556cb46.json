  "description": "Feline fam, we have to admit we're tired. It's not just the age, that many of you aging millennials must feel, it's the things we have to endure. We were once kids and essentially nothing happened. But from some point on, some major world events, most of them aren't the best, suddenly started occurring - and they just never seemed to stop since then. Are we wrong in this assessment? Because we feel this is an accurate description of this timeline.But despite the ongoing absolute mess of the world, there's one thing that keeps us grounded and happy, in our lane, and kept together - cats. Cats are this calming force of nature that we all have right inside our homes. Isn't that ameowzing? It is to us, at least, when we think about it. There might be another major historical event right around the corner (and we really don't wish for another, oh god, please, no) - but at least we have our cats to help us through it.If you're feeling the dread of another major historical event that's about to happen - we gathered some cat memes to help you through it. Especially if you don't have a cat in your immediate surroundings like you'd have at home. Scroll down for some very relatable cat comedy - it's like having a comforting cat right on your lap.",
