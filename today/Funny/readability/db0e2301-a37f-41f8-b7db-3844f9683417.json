  "description": "There is always a big transition when a smaller company gets bought by a larger one, and that transition takes time and patience. However, sometimes, the way in which the workplace used to be run was better for everyone involved, so when some fancy guy in a suit comes in and starts implementing annoying changes, it's inevitable that those changes will be met with some resistance.In this instance, we have an employee who now has to clock out every time he takes a break. However, according to the new system, he discovered that efvery break is clocked at 30 minutes no matter how long the break actually is. This meant that the employee was able to take breaks lasting one or two hours while complying with the new policy. Talk about a perfect situation! The best part is that if he were confronted with probing questions, he can say that he literally was just following HR's orders like any other loyal and compliant employee!",
