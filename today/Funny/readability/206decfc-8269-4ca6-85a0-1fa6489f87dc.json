  "description": "Whew, thank Ceiling Cat that we made it through the ruffest day of the week - Meowndays. There's nothing worse than hearing your alarm go off at 7 AM after being able to sleep in all weekend, getting up in the cold weather, and leaving your cute cats home alone while you go into the office for 8+ hours. But once we make it through Meownday, everything starts to get a little easier. Then we can finally set our sights on Furiday, and then, Caturday.But our purrsuance of Furriday on Tuesday is about as useful as our cats hunting a lone piece of lint that is hiding under the couch. Futile, one might even say. However, it gives us something to look forward to; some hope that we will make it to the weekend in one piece. That's why Ceiling Cat invented funny felines in meme form, to help us get through the difficult times in the best way pawssible - laughing. So get your giggle on and get ready to pounce into Furiday because it's coming (in only 96 more hours)!",
