  "text": "Jimmi Simpson celebrates his one-year anniversary with neither his sister nor his brother The McPoyle bloodline has been clean and pure for a thousand years before Liam decided that the dating pool and the gene pool need not be family-only affairs.On It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, there really aren’t many representations of loving families or meaningful romantic relationships, but, thankfully, the inbred Pennsylvanian tribe known as the McPoyles and their most notable twin sons offer us both simultaneously. Between Charlie’s longtime stalking of and eventual consummation with the Waitress, Dee’s dozens of plow partners, Frank’s deceased whoo-ur fiancee, Mac’s love-hate relationship with his own sexuality and Dennis’ entire arc with Mauree–er, Bastet, the Paddy’s Pub Gang can’t count a single happy, mutually fulfilling romantic relationship among them, making Liam and Ryan McPoyle’s “brotherly love” the longest-lasting and most caring relationship on the entire show. But it’s not exactly monogamous, as their sister can attest. When Liam first started expanding his romantic entanglements beyond his immediate family, it nearly drove his brother/lover Ryan to murder both Liam and his would-be wife Maureen. While the show hasn’t expanded on Liam’s plan to spread the McPoyle genes across the world, earlier this week, some nosy It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia fans noticed that longtime Always Sunny actor Jimmi Simpson just went Instagram official with his girlfriend, director Kyra Elise Gardner, on their one-year anniversary. Don't Miss Congrats on the anniversary — and the eye is looking very natural. Now, ever since a combination of Bill Ponderosa’s bath salts and Dennis’ lack of self-control while face-to-face with his “enhanced” ex-wife desecrated Liam’s first attempt at wooing a non-relative, the McPoyles seemed to have been on hiatus from their plan to take over the world through interbreeding as opposed to inbreeding. Apparently, since the end of Season 16, that has since changed, and the scheme is back on. Hopefully it goes better than their video rental business.
