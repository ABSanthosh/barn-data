  "description": "One of the best parts of working in an office is developing a work crush. It's an easy thing to do: you see these people every day for most of the day, so there's bound to be someone you have a connection. Having a crush makes going to work all the more worth it. It helps get you up in the morning; it gets you excited to be there. It may even make you more productive! A harmless work crush is the backbone of a working society, and without it, well, work wouldn't be worth doing.A work crush gets complicated when it starts to get too real. Dating in the workplace is unbelievably messy, and on top of the general work stress, it's not worth it to have the added stress of getting your feelings hurt. If all of a sudden you start to have real feelings for this person, or it gets in the way of you being able to do real work, you may need to take a step back. That's what one guy tried to do when his work crush said she didn't feel similarly, but things got weird when she started sending mixed messages. So, was this guy right to get HR involved? Or was this one to shove under the rug?",
