  "description": "Good meowrning, feline fam. We hope you're enjoying your morning scroll safely tucked away under the warm covers with at least one feline by your side. If not, stop whatever you're doing, get back into your pajamas, and snuggle up with your nearest cat (or four). If Caturdays are for cat memes and all things feline, then Sundays are for sleeping in and snoozing soundly. And we've got just the sweet kitties you need to inspire a slow, sensual start to your sleepy Sunday.Is there anything more purrfectly peaceful than watching your cat sleep? We'll wait, but we can already tell you that the answer is no. It ignites something in our hoooman hearts that just puts us at ease. Maybe it's seeing something we love feel so safe in the home we built for them, or their sweet tongues sticking out in blissful bleps while they dream. Whatever it is, it makes us want to enjoy the rest of the day from the comfort of our beds. Enjoy these cute kitties and we wish you a pawsitively restful weekend!",

  "text": "Not exaggerating, we are literally obsessed with this yawning cat. It's the exact vibe of today captured in one feline photo. In fact, we couldn't resist the urge to say, “Ooooooooooooooooh big stretch!” when we saw it. You know you want to. It's okay; this is a safe space. Say it with us: “Oooooooooooh biiiiiiiiiiiiiig stretch!” There, don't you feel better? Cats, when they sleep, exude purrre relaxation. Their breathing and serene poses (or twisty, contorted poses) can signal safety and tranquility to our brains, encouraging us to feel the same. Also, being around our pets can trigger the release of oxytocin, also known as the \"love hormone.\" This helps reduce stress and promotes a sense of connection and contentment. But all of that science mumbo-jumbo aside, it's just downright cute!",
