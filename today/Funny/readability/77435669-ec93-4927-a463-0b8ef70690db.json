  "description": "Becoming a cat pawrent is not an easy decision to make. They are (hopefully) a 20-year commitment. They need your attention, love, time, consistency, and stability. Not everyone can purrvide those things, especially not truckers who frequently work 14+ hour days. Heck, we can barely manage to keep our cats happy when we're gone for only nine hours a day! After rescuing this cute black cat, the trucker and the kitty formed an ameowzing bond. However, because the pawrent is gone so much, the cat acts out. There's nothing that can be done - the pawrent has to work and the cat can't come with him. So the pawrent wonders to himself, \"Maybe my cat is better off with someone else?\" Naturally, they look for every solution, including finding a new job, but he finds out that he will have to pay his company $10,000 if he wants to quit. That's quite a steep price!He writes about the whole thing below so give it a scroll and let us know what you think!",
