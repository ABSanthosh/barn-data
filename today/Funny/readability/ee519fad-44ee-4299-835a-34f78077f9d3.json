  "description": "Working too much is just not good for anyone. Even the most resilient employee starts to wilt if they're not given proper rest time. Working is supposed to be just one portion of your life. You're supposed to be able to clock out and spend time with family and friends, sleep, cook some nice meals, and maybe read or watch TV before you start it all over again. If you've ever spent time with someone who's overworking themself, you can see the toll it takes. When all you're thinking about is your boss, your customers, and your clients, you get weary down to your bones. It's one thing to be physically tired, but when you don't have time to remember what makes life worth living, you get tired psychologically, too. Burnout is sure to follow. Just ask this person, whose boss literally asked them to work for three weeks straight! Commenters advised them not to do that, and some offered up some alternative messages for them to send back to the boss. After that, read these unforgettably bad job interviews, like one hiring manager who was bemused to discover that they 'Interviewed someone who... technically wasn't allowed to be in the building.'",
