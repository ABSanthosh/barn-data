  "description": "Nina's team has a new developer on the team. They're not a junior developer, though Nina wishes they could replace this developer with a junior. Inexperience is better than whatever this Java code is. Object[] test = (Object[]) options; List schedulePlatformList = (List)((Object[])options)[0]; List visibleTableCols = (List)((Object[])options)[1]; We start by casting options into an array of Objects. That's already a code stench, but we actually don't even use the test variable and instead just redo the cast multiple times. But worse than that, we cast to an array of object, access an element, and then cast that element to a collection type. I do not know what is in the options variable, but based on how it gets used, I don't like it. What it seems to be is a class (holding different options as fields) rendered as an array (holding different options as elements). The new developer (ab)uses this pattern everywhere.
