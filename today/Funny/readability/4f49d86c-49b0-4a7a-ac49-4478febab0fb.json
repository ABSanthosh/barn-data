  "description": "Whoa, whoa whoa. What is happening here? Are pigs flying? Has the fat lady sung? Here we have an entitled Karen customer changing her ways after being called out. She didn't dig deeper into her tantrum; she didn't blame everyone around her; she even sincerely apologized to the employee she snapped on… What is going on?? Dare we say… are… Are Karens learning the horrors of their ways? Has there been enough complaint online and throughout younger generations that Karens are starting to realize that they are the problem and are actually changing their behavior? Or is this just an outlier of a story we've come across… We hope not! We're rooting for our faith in humanity to be restored!",

However, when a young gentleman witnessed this he called her out. He explained that she was being entitled and that she needed to show a little human compassion for this individual obviously overwhelmed at work. “She immediately said, 'we’ll they should have planned better, they knew we were coming.' And I said 'okay. That has nothing to do with the bartender. She’s doing her best and is entirely alone and overwhelmed.'”The Karen stopped, thought about it, and then sincerely expressed regret. She was sorry and made sure to apologize to everyone she was just a Karen to. Like, what? WE LOVE THAT. PLEASE, MORE OF THIS. Let the empathy bug spread!",
