  "description": "When my mom calls, I feel like it's because she has a preternatural ability to contact me right as I'm about to engage in a task. It's a skill, and she has mastered it. The moment a task is about to begin, as soon as the mise en place has been… you know, placed, a communique from my Creator bores into the proceedings. I think I have inherited her uncanny knack for auguring into otherwise useful moments, because when I call my own child - who is not a child, I must remind myself, but a legal adult - they act like I'm trying to sell them a timeshare.",

What would it be like to have a \"meal plan\" where \"dining dollars\" are hoarded in some vault and I can have pizza at midnight, paid for by the aelves? I can't see how you don't get in trouble with something like this, holy shit. You're out there in a place where God can't see you, and under such conditions, we know: nocturnal hungers rise. But they're good. They seem like they're doing good? They ain't starving, at any rate. Jesus! Our friends - literal, IRL friends - at Dire Wolf just added a couple days to their Last Chance Pre-Order, making this your Last Chance at a Last Chance Pre-Order. I'm waiting for my copy too!
