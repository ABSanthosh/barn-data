  "description": "It's a hard place to be when you are an animal lover, but are getting terrorized by a domesticated animal. It's much more complicated than dealing with a wild animal, like raccoons or opossums, because now you have to deal with a human… And humans are much more stubborn if you can believe it (we definitely can). When someone's pet is misbehaving, it is the pet owner's fault, so you have to address them rather than the pet directly. This happens often when there are irresponsible pet owners who refuse to pick up after their beloved furry friends. It's not the pet's fault! They literally don't have thumbs. They couldn't pick up their droppings even if they wanted to! They'd have to eat it, and we all know that is very unhealthy…  So it's up to the human, and yet, there are many entitled and/or lazy pet owners out there who just don't care. If their pet wants to relieve themselves on your property, you should feel lucky. They aren't going to pick up the icky stuff! Their pets chose to do their business there, so there it shall be and you must accept that!! Well… No, no you don't.",

  "text": "One homeowner turned to Reddit to share their tactic for getting their neighbor's outdoor cat to stop going on his house. Long story short, after asking politely many times, he set up a trap, caught it, and took it to the shelter. Many cat owners disapproved of this tactic, but many others were all about it! The thought they all agreed on was: If you are going to be an irresponsible pet owner, maybe you shouldn't own a pet. The thread then turned into others sharing their hinged and “unhinged” tactics of getting their neighbors to stop allowing their pets to go on their property. Many are gross since it's a gross business. But some are just silly! See for yourself below.",
