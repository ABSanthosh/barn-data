  "description": "If your boss is making you grind your teeth, you're in good company. The people of the internet joined together to share the reasons why their boss has been getting on their last nerves, and there are some crazy stories out there! Some people have bosses who just don't appreciate a single thing they do. The boss is so focused on meeting their goals or delivering a project to a client that they don't acknowledge all the hard work it takes to make that happen. It can be so frustrating to work a 60-hour week, only to have your boss chastise you over a typo or an unsent email. It's bad for morale, because who wants to work overtime if their work goes unnoticed? Other people shared that their bosses were too callous. Some bosses act like they were raised on a different planet or something. When someone's family member passes away, and an employee asks for time to plan a funeral or grieve, most decent humans will respect that. We'll all go through dark times in our lives, so it's only polite to handle this with grace. But some managers will just coldly insist their workers be in for their shift anyway. It's no wonder a lot of the people below ended up fleeing their jobs and heading off to a better on ASAP. Next, read about this person who had to tell a pushy family member that \"We don't need to be around each other 24/7\" after she invited herself on a vacation!",
