  "description": "Being a property owner has many perks, one of which, is that you can do whatever the heck you want on your own land–it's yours. This avid hunter in our next story owned 7 acres just outside of town where all the local game walked through, making it a primo spot for at-home hobby hunting. However, with that nice of a setup, the neighbors were bound to get a little jealous. Like a binoculared Kevin claiming to be the neighborhood watch, the guy next door started turning green over the property adjacent to his. He wanted to hunt there just like his neighbor, so, being the entitled guy he was, he assumed it was his prerogative to take claim over his neighbor's property surveillance.Big mistake, buddy. Keep reading for all the details of this property dispute that might just persuade this father-in-law to build a 20ft wall on his neighbor's side of the property, preventing wildlife from ever walking through his yard again.",
