  "text": "Published: October 9, 2024 NEW YORK—In a move widely criticized as insulting the intelligence of viewers, a movie chyron reportedly drew outrage Wednesday for reading “Davenport, IA” as if it wasn’t glaringly obvious that the establishing shot was of Vander Veer Botanical Park. “Yeah, no shit we’re in Davenport, IA—do they really think I need that spelled out for me when I’m looking right at Vander Veer Botanical Park’s historic Grand Allée?” said moviegoer Marshall Helms, who added that he had half a mind to demand a refund if the movie was going to continue with the condescending bullshit. “I can infer the setting from Vander Veer’s iconic Stone Fountain without some stupid chyron holding my hand the whole goddamn time, thanks. It’s probably just for international viewers, but I still find it demeaning when films have so little faith in their audience. I’m not some uncultured swine who will see Davenport’s Municipal Rose Garden and confuse it for the fucking Quad City Botanical Center without the movie’s help.” At press time, Helms reportedly stormed out of the theater after a second chyron reading “November” was overlaid on an unmistakable shot of Vander Veer Conservatory’s annual Chrysanthemum Festival.
