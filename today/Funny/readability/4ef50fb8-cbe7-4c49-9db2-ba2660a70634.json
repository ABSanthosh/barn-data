  "description": "This was not exactly the wedding of anyone's dreams.Let's start with the bride and groom of this event, who had to switch wedding planners about ten days prior to the ceremony.

To make matters more upsetting, this was a Wish Upon a Wedding event (keep scrolling below for further details).From the wedding planner's perspective, this was about as disastrous as it could get. She inherited the prior planner's mess and had entrusted that the catering was all good to go, having confirmed with her about the details the day before. Unfortunately, the wedding planner was left scrambling and eventually found help in a nearby restaurant, who she gives a shout-out to at the end of her account of this debacle. Keep scrolling below for the full story.
