While it may have caused some confusion among viewers who attempted to turn up the volume or alter their TV settings, we ultimately stand by our decision.” According to reports, Fox censors successfully muted Lamar’s microphone, but they were unable to avoid broadcasting the sound of 75,000 shouting fans in the Superdome calling Drake a “certified pedophile.” Related Coverage Read More",
