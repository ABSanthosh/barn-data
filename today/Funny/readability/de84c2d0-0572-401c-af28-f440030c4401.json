  "description": "For some women, it's heartwarming to have a child seek out their attention. However, this woman was cornered in her cubicle in the workplace by her colleague's 6-year-old daughter, and the little girl demanded to call her \"Mom.\" Perhaps in another context—you know, NOT in the workplace—this might have been seen as adorable or even sweet, but this woman considered the daughter's clingy behavior a hindrance to her work, and also an inappropriate advance from her coworker. While the dad didn't have much say in the matter of bringing his daughter to work following a sticky divorce, he did have control over how to parent the little girl in the workplace. So when he failed to do so, his coworker was forced to take action herself, teaching the little girl some manners in the workplace because her father didn't bother to.",

Mortified by my misnomer, I shriveled as the other kids laughed at me, and I never made the mistake again. For a kid, it's easy to mistakenly call an adult woman “Mom” by accident, but doing it repeatedly without correction from a parent sends a strange message. So this woman was in the right to step up and clarify a few things with the girl, keeping the record straight with a little girl who may always miss her mommy.",
