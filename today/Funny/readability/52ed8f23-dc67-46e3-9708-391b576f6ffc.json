  "description": "Nothing is more satisfying than proving to someone just how much they lost by letting you go. Either in a relationship context when you see your ex after a few months and you can simply tell they regret breaking up with you, or it can be in the workplace contextâ€“when you prove to a past employer how wrong they were when they decided to fire you or push you away.Getting fired or broken up with is someone no one wants to experience, but if you do, you have to make the best out of it and make them truly regret that decision. The story down below is the perfect example of that.The employee who wrote this story was unexpectedly let go from their job, with little to no explanation from their employer. As they were leaving, they were told they were 'easily replaceable', which gave way to the perfect and satisfying opportunity to show the employer what they will lose by letting them go, even if it was unintentional.",

  "text": "How did that happen, you ask?Since the employee was managing the company's largest client, and did so successfully, it did not sit well with the client to see the employee getting wrongfully fired. This led the client to take action to ensure that the employee can still work for them, even if it isn't with the company as the intermediate. So the client offered the employee a much better contract, which means that the company not only lost a valuable employee, but their biggest client.
