  "description": "Machismo new hires can be the bane of the office floor. This new sales rep was decidedly arrogant when he came into the new workplace, strutting around like he knew exactly what he was doing when instead, he was destroying all of the computers in the department. When you're new in an office environment, it's hard not to feel the pressure of expectations. As the new kid on the block, everyone feels like they have something to prove, but if you're barking up the wrong tree in the wrong department, you're bound to find yourself in a situation where you're completely out of your wheelhouse. At that point, most level-headed new hires would let the pros handle their expertise, but this guy in our next story, a transplant from the sales floor, thought that he could out-tech the IT crew. Except, instead of proving that he was as capable as the electronics specialists downstairs, he caused thousands in damages and ruined the electronics on an entire floor in one fell swoop.
