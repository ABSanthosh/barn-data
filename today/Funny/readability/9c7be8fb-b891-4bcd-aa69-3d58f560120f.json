Even as I look at you now, I can see no body language indicating a level of romantic chemistry sufficient to warrant a marriage license. Your affection, though it may exist, is just not at the threshold of making me hear wedding bells when you gaze into each other’s eyes.” At press time, sources confirmed the couple had successfully appealed the ruling after Garcia gave his fiancée a tennis bracelet that must have cost at least $800.",
