  "description": "Sometimes, the only way to show a choosing beggar that they're being ridiculous is to be ridiculous yourself. There are some folks who, despite being desperately in need of new supplies, are so entitled that they think they can get away with paying next to nothing for what they want. The most common place to find these desperate individuals is obviously Facebook Marketplace, where half of the people who claim they want to buy something lack the follow-through to actually purchase and pick up their item. Let this story serve as yet another example of what happens when choosing beggars underestimate the folks they are trying to swindle. In this instance, we have a seller who was trying to get rid of tires for half the original price, and yet this one entitled, choosing beggar thought he could negotiate paying just over 12% of the original value. He would end up regretting giving such an insulting offer.",
