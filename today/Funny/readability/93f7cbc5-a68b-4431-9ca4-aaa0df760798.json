  "description": "Happy Meownday, feline fam. We're writing about this post below to share some impawtant life lessons with you, but first, let's give you a little summary of what to expect. A feline foster mom decided to look after her friends' cat for an indefinite amount of time. Weeks turned into months, and months turned into a year. She, of course, became purrfectly bonded with the cute kitty. But then, when they came back, they expected her to return the cat to them, even though she already felt like the cat was hers. This is the first life lesson that we hope to impart to you: cat ownership is not based on emeowtions. Just because she cared for the cat, and even paid for expenses, the cat had a microchip with her friends' names on it, and they have documentation of ownership. This is all that matters. If they have a microchip, they legally belong to someone else… even if you rescued them off the street. Scroll down to read how an unfortunate miscommunication forced her to give back the cat she fell in love with below.Fluff. Chaos. Drama! Our weekly cat newsletter has it all -  subscribe here.",
