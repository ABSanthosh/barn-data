  "description": "If you thought the worst thing that could happen while making caramel is the sugar burning, think again. You never know just how bad one person can be at cooking or baking until you witness it for yourself. There are some basics that you assume everyone knows, but then you watch your friend making food and they'll casually say something like \"You don't have to wash or peel carrots\" or \"I used baking powder instead of flour, but I think these biscuits will still turn out fine.\" It makes you question everything you know about the fine arts of cooking and baking. And more often than not, taking any kind of recipe shortcut will result in a complete flop.When trying to eat more vegan or vegetarian, you need to use substitutions all the time. It's the fastest way to figure out that almond milk burns quickly and does not really taste like milk in many recipes. You'll start to wonder why your recipes are turning out undercooked or raw just because you used applesauce instead of butter. Unless you follow a proper set of directions to a T, you're going to be eating a lot of unfortunate foods. The people below have some very funny foods they ruined with their own substitutions: give them a read and see if you've ever messed up anything this badly! And as for the caramel mentioned before, that one got really messed up: the cook melted the spoon right into the caramel! You can read the rest of their tale in photo #15. Up next, read about the entitled cafe customer who demanded free coffee: \"[She] said I should honor it because she's a loyal customer.\"",

This cake looks a little underbaked, though. And who knows if they warned the students about the substitution before they took that first bite!  12 13As long as he likes the results, so be it 14 15 16 17Vanilla yogurt is personally responsible for so many of these cooking fails The original poster reports that \"It actually wasn't terrible,\" but that they still scraped it off and tried to add the sour cream as intended.  18Milk is what made the difference in the golden milk recipe, huh? This guy was trying to take the methodology of making powdered hot chocolate with water and applying it to this. No wonder it didn't turn out quite right (much like hot chocolate made with water).  19 21Please, no cheese in the brownie mix 22 23You saved yourself from a wicked toothache 24 This person 1) didn't make the recipe, and 2) didn't want meat in it? What is Maytwist03 even trying to get across with their 1-star review? General dissatisfaction?  25Commenters were quick to tell Vickie that she wasted food One person informed her that \"It is normal for oil to congeal in the fridge. It goes back to normal consistency when you take them out. FYI.\" Oh well, now she knows for next time.  Stay up to date by following us on Facebook!
