  "text": "Buying clothing you’ll enjoy and own long-term can reduce the amount that ends up in landfills. Here are tips for finding your personal style: Use color analysis to determine if you’re a winter, spring, summer, or climate apocalypse. Put together a fun mood board based on the Book of Leviticus.  Walk in and out of the dressing room until your friends stop frowning and shaking their heads “no,” and start smiling and shaking their heads “yes.” Take inspiration from your favorite celebrities who have a similar $100 clothing budget.  Rules are just rules, but as a general guideline, you should never clash superhero characters. Be honest and ask yourself if your ass really is worthy of the term “Juicy.” Go to a department store and tell the salesperson that you just woke up on a Mediterranean fishing vessel with no memory of who you are, and you need help putting together an outfit.  Don’t follow trends too closely, but remember that each gaffe you make shaves another decade off your social relevance. Look glumly into your closet and put on whatever is clean.",
