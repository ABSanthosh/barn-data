  "description": "If you packed a lunch for work today, pat yourself on the back. That is such a good habit to get in! Some people are forced to do that because their office is in a food desert, but when it's not… Well, let's just say it's hard to find the motivation to pack a lunch every single day to bring to work when you can just walk right outside and grab a delicious sandwich. Usually, packing your own lunch tends to be healthier and cheaper. So when you pack a lunch, that is a great achievement! Congrats. Now you have something to look forward to! But, oh no, what's this? You have a psychopath in the bunch who is stealing people's lunches! Somehow they are too sneaky to get caught and you can't do the ole laxative in the food thing or else HR will get you for poisoning or something. Luckily, in the case of this woman and her office lunch thief, she didn't even have to take any action to catch him.",
