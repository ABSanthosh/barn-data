  "description": "When you first start working in the career field of your dreams, you have to tread lightly. Like in every field, your first few jobs might not be your best fit. You might not like what you are actually being assigned to do, you might not vibe well with your coworkers or higher ups, or you might just be figuring out that you'd rather be following a different career path. Just because you have all of these snags, does not mean you should burn those bridges. You never know when you are going to have to work with those people again! And that's not even on a career later climbing level, that's just on a human level. What if that coworker you hate coincidentally takes the same job pivot as you and now you're back in the interview room and they are the ones doing the hiring process? You never know!  Here, you can see the most perfect example of a boss making the wrong move on a brand new employee and it coming back to haunt him in the future.",
