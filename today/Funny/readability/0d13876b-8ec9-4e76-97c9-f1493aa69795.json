  "description": "Hey feline friends, do you smell that? It's the smell of love in the air! And cat litter, but that's just because we cleaned our kitties' boxes. But we're here to talk about love, marriage, and a meowraculous act from the cat distribution system. The CDS really is a meowracle. It never fails. Maybe it catches you off guard, maybe you were looking for another cat to add to your feline family, or maybe, the CDS helps the cat find you. Either way, each success story from the CDS is worthy of being told because it makes us feel pawsitively heartwarming.When one kind couple went to Hawaii to tie the knot, they found a homeless void kitten outside of their hotel. They tried to take them to a shelter, but the shelter workers said that no one would take him, so what else are you supposed to do when you find an abandoned kitten? Naturally, you love him and turn him into your awwdorably handsome ringbearer. Scroll down to read the whole wholesome story below!",

It's almost too good to be true. These feline pawrents are living in a Disney movie….and we're totally jealous. Bob truly is a purrfectly cute cat. Look at those long legs and that sassy stare. We're sure he's very happy to be in his furrever home, and really, what an unfurgettable story this feline family has. Who else can say that they adopted their cat right before getting married, and ended up making him the ring bearer??",
