  "description": "We tell people every day that having pets, and cats specifically, is one of the best things that they can do for themselves. Cats are not only cute, which they are, and yes, you could stare at them every day for hours just napping and not get bored. And cats are not only funny, which they definitely are, without even having to try. Cats also bring calm into our daily lives. All they do is lie there, happy and purring, and their calmness seeps right into our hearts, making us happy too. But we also have to admit… it's not always calmness and peacefulness with our cats. Most of the time, cats are lazy and happy and calm, but sometimes… during those special moments that you will never ever forget as a cat owner, your cats bring complete and utter chaos into your lives. And you know what? Years down the line, these are the moments that you will be talking about and laughing about the most.",
