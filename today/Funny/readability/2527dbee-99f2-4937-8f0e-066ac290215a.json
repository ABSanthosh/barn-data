Perhaps you hope someone calls them out, or they get fired, or they slip on a banana peel in the cafeteria. No one could dream up this perfect confluence of events.This student, who was now over ten years out of school, was still haunted by the treatment she received from one of her former teachers: Ms. Samantha. Ms. Samantha was an unkind excuse of a \"professor\" whose words had a long-term impact on this author and their educational future. Years after the damage was done, the author was visiting home and was taking a long walk in the park. That's when a chance encounter with a skunk and another chance encounter with Ms. Samantha herself gave the author the perfect plan.
