  "description": "Happy Friday, fellow cat people! We hope that you have had an absolutely fabulous week. But just in case you haven't, we know your Friday will be much, much better after you see all these recently adopted faces this week! Every single week, we bring you a fresh out of the oven, warm and heartwarming collection of wholesome cat adoption stories. Because after a difficult week, if there is one thing that can make us smile, it's a whole bunch of kitties finding their furrever homes.As always, we would like to start by thanking all of those who have recently adopted a cat, all those who have adopted a cat in the past, and all of those who will be adopting a cat in the future. You all are changing these cats' lives for the better, so, thank you. And a mega-huge-ultra shoutout to those who adopted a senior cat or a pet who requires a little more love and care than most. You are our forever heroes.",

This is Silverstone, my new best friend \u003c3\" 02\"Went to check out a noise outside at my mom’s house and found a very friendly cat. After we decided to take him home, he called in his equally friendly cohort. I think they pulled a scheme on us.\" \"This is the same place we rescued a kitten from two years ago, so there's a chance that the CDS has ordered a family reunion of sorts. First order of business is to call the vet and get them checked out and their neutering scheduled. Also tick pulling. So much tick pulling.\" 03\"I found her on my street a year ago. She was super skinny. Today was our first snuggle.\" 04\"This little criminal was hurled out the window of a moving car by her former POS owner. She's mine now.\" \"Boyfriends mom saw this little girl THROWN out of the car while moving. She stopped and grabbed her up and got clawed in the face for her trouble. After a trip to the pet store for kitten vittles and toys we brought her home. She was filthy and covered in fleas. She had a Dawn bath and is currently snoozing on my belly. She will be treasured. Her tentative name is Marla Singer.\" 05\"Adopted him few hours ago, and he already gave me a smile :)\" 06\"A friend just adopted surprise kitten.\" 07\"After long time lurking, wife and I finally decided to adopt a void. This is his first day with us.\" 08\"Officially adopted this cutie today!\" 09\"Just adopted this guy today, had everything set up in the bathroom thinking he’d take a bit to warm up, but he just follows me everywhere I go.\" 10\"I adopted mine today! Was told his brain cell would come in the mail in 3-4 weeks.\" 11\"My new baby stands for treats\" 12\"Sweet girl was begging me to adopt her\" 13\"The cat distribution system works in mysterious ways...\" \"We adopted this cat from the shelter 4 (!!!!!) days ago and she was incredibly shy, timid, and scared. She would hiss at us when we came into her room and would hardly leave her igloo bed. Fast forward to now, she is quickly becoming my Velcro cat. After two days I coaxed her to come to the living room with treat bribery, and to my surprise she jumped up on the couch with me. Now, she follows me around, comes when I call (usually. She is still a cat after all), and sleeps curled up next to us on the couch. I was expecting weeks of aloof-ness from her. She truly was meant to be with us\" 14\"I just adopted this baby!!!!!\" 15\"this cat literally adopted ME, not the other way around\" 16\"Finally joined the club! Adopted this sweet boy and it’s been the best decision\" \"His name is GrizzlyHe is about 6 months olds. At 2 months old he was found in the yard of a volunteer from the rescue we adopted him from, and was in their care until we got him.He was purring and cuddling the moment we met him and as soon as we brought him home. Truly the sweetest boy\" 17\"When I saw Odin on the adoption website, I new I needed to adopt him!\" 18\"Adopted by a Cat at Waffle House\" 19\"Rescued this calico angel three weeks ago and now she's fully part of the family\" 20\"Little Angie adopted me on Saturday\" \"Angel was a street cat until last Saturday when she found me parked in her area. She realized my car is warm and I seem pretty nice, so she decided very quickly that she's coming home with me. Angie jumped in the car through the open window and made herself comfortable on the dashboard. I drove home with her sleeping on my lap. Angel is an absolute sweetheart and purrs like a tractor. Unfortunately she is very thin, the vet thinks she wouldn't have survived another winter outside; we are working together to get her in good health. Angie is adapting very well to apartment life and to her Beagle brother. I'm starting to believe she is half dog too.\" Tags Scroll down for the next article Also From I Can Has Cheezburger?",

Angie is adapting very well to apartment life and to her Beagle brother.
