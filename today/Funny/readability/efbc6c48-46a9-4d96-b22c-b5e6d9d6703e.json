  "description": "We hope you're having a sweet, slow Sunday, feline fam. We are currently snuggled up on our couch, surrounded by blankets and fluffy felines, wishing we were somewhere warmer (with our cats, of course). Doesn't a vacation sound just purrfect right now? Some nice, tropical beach or a city where it's above freezing will do. Actually, we'll go anywhere where we're not 2-feet-deep in snow. If we have the chance to encounter the cat distribution system, even better. It's important to always be prepurred to welcome a new kitty into your life. Even when you're on vacation. When you see a cat in need, you don't think, you just do. And that's exactly what this loving cat mom did! She found a Siamese kitten in a kitten mill and immediately scooped her up and adopted her. They traveled back to the US together, and now they're one big, fluffy feline family. She got a trip to Mexico and cute cat? We're just a little bit jealous. Okay, more than a little bit. Scroll down to read the full story below!",

It's simply too cute and we wish we could jump through the screen to give her some awwdorable forehead kisses. She deserves it! We've never traveled internationally with a pet before, but it sounds stressful. So many papers, so many tests that have to be done…but where there's a will, there's a way. We would do anything for our cats, so naturally, it makes sense that she would do it for her newest feline family member.",
