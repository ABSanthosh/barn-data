  "description": "It doesn't matter how old you are when it comes to purchasing a stuffed animal, but for a fully grown lady to throw a tantrum over one is a whole different ballgame. Here's the deal: if stuffed animals or blankets provide you comfort as a sixty-something-year-old, that is well within your right. Whatever provides comfort to help you go through this harsh world is a personal choice, and we should de-stigmatize the idea that being an adult means not clinging to those sources of comfort. That being said, there's a line, of course, and for this Karen, she probably should not have overreacted in a public setting over the price of a stuffed animal. Her tantrum only makes the idea of wanting a stuffed animal as an adult seem childish, but we should be clear here. What's childish is her tantrum, not the stuffed animal itself.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.
