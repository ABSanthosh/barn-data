  "description": "Imagine this: You find the love of your life and after only a year and a half he proposes! You are so excited, but he confesses he can only afford a cheap wedding. If has always been your dream to have a huge wedding, but you love him so much, you figured you would make it work somehow! Wouldn't you just opt for a smaller wedding?

Well, this young bride decided that in order to have her cake and eat it too, she was going to demand all of her friends and family throw her a wedding for free.  That's right, she said that she would call in some \"favors,\" but the point of favors is that you already did something for the other person of equal value, and now they owe you. This bride seemed to thing her friendship was enough to demand she get everything for free…",
