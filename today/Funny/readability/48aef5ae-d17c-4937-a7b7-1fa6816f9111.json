  "description": "Gabe doesn't even watch trailers, so some attempt to lure him with grainy cell phone shots ain't gon' work. I watch trailers all the time just to find something I missed! We are up to our asses in information, and I usually feel like I'm seeing the parts of it that I need to see, but then I find out there's some kind of Scottish samurai movie or some shit. I feel very strongly that they have enough psychometric data on me to have shown me this one, but I had to dig around in the dirt for it like a marmot.",

Even I don't go in for supposedly illicit set photos, though. I can never fully ascertain if I'm being subjected to a fourth generation warfare info drop that's literally just part of the marketing. Films, especially Marvel films, occur after they're filmed. And then, they rely on a certain amount of meeting them in the middle. We want Cliff Barton to do whatever he's doing there and so we give him a little buddy punch on the arm; go get it, man. That is not what you get in these washed out, digitally zoomed photographs! It's the same energy as when Peter Jackson was fucking around with those high frame rates on The Hobbit and it looked like a Fantasy Ball. Outside the Covenant of the Theater you enter into with your popcorn sacrament in tow, these shots of people doing just just look like… people doing stuff. The Cosplay you'd see at PAX, or Sakura-Con, looks better! It's designed to be looked at in the real world. (CW)TB out.",
