  "description": "There are people in this world whose first instinct is to play the fool when they are caught doing something wrong. Of course, this is the kind of behavior we often associate with children when they are caught eating one more piece of candy after their parents have said they have consumed enough sweets or when they sneak out of their rooms well after bedtime to watch one more hour of television. Regardless of how strict parents are with their children, kids will always break the rules and then pretend they have no idea that they are doing anything wrong. It's expected behavior.Now, when adults are caught red-handed, one would think they would have enough chutzpah to confess their wrongdoing and own up to itâ€¦ but one would be wrong to think this way. In fact, many adults have the tendency to double down on their behavior, as this entitled fool did when he was caught using a stranger's email address with the same first and last name for hotel bookings.",

  "text": "Before we delve into the details, it's worth clarifying that this entitled guy was informed well in advance that he was using the wrong email address before things really got out of hand. He was given ample opportunity to apologize and correct his ways, but instead, he ignored the real person's attempts to sort out this miscommunication. He even went further and started using the account for travel and other expenses, which were quickly discovered by the real person behind the account. Several people in the community commented and shared their own similar experiences with this kind of scenario and childish behavior.
