  "description": "The minute your boss suggests you start doing work that isn't listed in your job description, you must be asking for additional compensation. You aren't getting paid to do a laundry list of items on top of your daily duties. Your day-to-day tasks are what's included in your contract, and any other duties must be given to you in writing with a pretty little dollar sign next to it.What's worse than not receiving compensation for the extra work you're doing? Being treated like garbage after you've done the work. The employee in this next story is told to stay outside and eat under the hot sun after they spent the entire day doing landscaping work that, of course, is not listed in his job description. The employee should have requested some additional pay, but that's not the issue in this story. The entitled boss let the employees doing landscaping indoors eat inside, but because of a little dirt on the employee's shoes, they had to eat outside. So, the employee left. Scroll to read.",
