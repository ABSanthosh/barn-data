  "description": "Cats are already one of the most elegant animals to ever exist (besides the few times when they are absolutely silly billies). But when cats reach a certain age where they're considered seniors, another layer of elderly grace is added on top of the regular cat elegance. Cats who manage to reach 14, 15, and even 16 years of age, are like cat royalty, moving slowly and demanding respect from the cat youth. There's something captivating in a senior cat - on the one hand, a strong desire to protect their fragility, and on the other hand, a fierce awe of their longevity. And even more so when senior cats reach 20 and more - which is absolutely impressive.Some senior cat pawrents shared pictures and bits of information about their old feline friends, that they have spent many years together with. It's truly awe inspiring and heartwarming. Some of us were surprised with how many cats can reach this respectful old age, and some of us reminisced about their long-gone senior feline friends that they've had. And what sort of feline feelings will it awake within you?",
