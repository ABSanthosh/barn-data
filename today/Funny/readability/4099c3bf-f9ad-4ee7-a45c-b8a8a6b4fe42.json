  "description": "Some workers just never properly learn Zoom call etiquette. A lot of folks got really proficient at using the video call service when we all had to work at our homes for a while a few years back. But others are still new to the app, and aren't quite sure how to run a meeting. For example, it's common etiquette to mute your microphone if you aren't speaking. It's not enough just to stay quiet, because there's bound to be background noise, like kids running around, dogs barking, or cars revving. If you're muted, no one can hear you take a sip of your drink or tap your feet. Even little noises can be distracting to the current speaker, and unmuting yourself can happen with a single click of a button. This student had a similar experience before ever joining the workforce as they met up with a school club through a video call. But the club already had some \"weird rules,\" as the student explained, leading to the club organizers demanding that everyone turn on their cameras and microphones at all times. That seems like a recipe for disaster! Up next, read about these people who tried to be funny, only to have their jokes backfire in their faces, leaving them completely embarrassed.",
