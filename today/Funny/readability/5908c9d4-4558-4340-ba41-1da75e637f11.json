  "description": "Oh, dear readers, have we got some wholesome kitty content for you today. You've seen bundles of cute kittens before. You've seen wholesome hoomans rescuing cats as well. But, what about a heart-melting collection of kittens and their wholesome hoomans growing side by side into furrever friends? Yeah, we told you so. This splendid series is full of pictures of tiny hoomans and their even smaller kittens becoming adults together. If you've had a cat from kitten-hood to crossing the rainbow bridge, you know how special this feline feeling is. So basically, we're saying to get your tissues ready.Just like kittens can create wholesome bonds with other cats (we call this a \"bonded pair\" in purrfessional terms), the bond between a child and their kitten is unlike any other. They learn about the world together, play dress up together, and create heapings of happy memories together. Whether you're just in the mood to look at some wholesome pictures or you want to remember what it was like when you and your kitten were younger, these pictures will probably make you a little emeowtional - and that's purrfectly okay.",
