  "description": "Bad service at a restaurant or bar is one of life's minor yet soul-crushing annoyances. You know, the kind of service where the orders take forever, drinks are left unfilled, or that awkward moment when the server doesn't even pretend to care that you've been side eyeing them for the past 20 minutes. Most of us try to cut servers some slack—after all, they're probably overworked, underpaid, and likely juggling a table full of Karens who are making their lives miserable. Even if the service is terrible, the guilt often keeps us still tipping 20% out of sheer sympathy.But not everyone can brush off bad service so easily. One guy found a hilariously petty way to get back at an inattentive server... by serving auditory chaos in the form of the worst song ever on the bar's jukebox. We're talking about a 26-minute sonic nightmare that messes with your head, infuriates the staff, and leaves everyone in the place disturbed. The best part is that he gets his revenge without ever having to say a word. Keep reading for this hilariously clever act of vengeance.",
