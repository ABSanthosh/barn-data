  "text": "Going to the shelter looking for your next fluffy friend can be a stressful experience for some people. There is a lot going on there, and it might not be a magical ‘love at first sight’ moment like we all love to imagine. It can even be too much for the sweet pets who are looking for a furrever home, which might cause them to act shy or scared around the hoomans who are looking around.When we hear about a successful shelter adoption story, we are delighted and excited to learn more, much like we were when we encountered this sweet story.This pawdorable black cat and heartwarming hooman met at a shelter, and it was a truly magical moment. The cat, coincidentally (or not) called ‘Magic’, fell in love with the hooman Jade, and instantly gave her love he had not given anyone else in over two years.In a later video, Jade the hooman shares the full story of how she and Magic fell in love, and we truly had tears in our eyes hearing their awwdorable story.Keep scrolling to watch the full videos yourselves. After you are done, click here for another silly story of a hooman who saved a kitten from an entitled kid at the shelter.Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat!  Scroll down for the next article",
