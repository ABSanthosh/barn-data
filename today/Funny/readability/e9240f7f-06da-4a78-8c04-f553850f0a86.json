  "description": "We think that everyone knows at this point that foxes are just… cat software running on dog hardware. If you think about it for just a few seconds, you will realize that it is true. So, is it really a surprise that cats and foxes are such good friends sometimes, that if their paths cross, they end up getting along? We don't think so. But after such a long time writing for ICHC, we have seen it many times. We have seen cats and foxes play together. We have seen cats groom foxes. We have seen foxes reunite with cats that they grew up with, and it's as emotional as any reunion video we've seen. This duo just kind of makes sense, so coming across this video didn't even surprise us. It did make us aww though. And we're sure it will do the same to you. Because no matter how many times you see it, watching cats and foxes be such good friends is one of the cutest, most wholesomest things in the world.",
