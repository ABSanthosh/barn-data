  "description": "In this job market, or any job market, really, optimistic job-seekers choose to believe the gig they landed will work out. This willful ignorance allows us to get by and curb our warranted suspicions about the job role. Is it a good idea to curb our judgment? Probably not. Do we do it anyway and wait until the first day to make a judgment call? Yep. Sometimes, employees don't need to wait out the entire eight-hour shift to realize they should throw on their walking boots and hit the road, and fast. Entitled supervisors and cardboard box desks will do that to anyone.This r/AskReddit thread is riddled with stories from employees sharing their reasons for hitting the road during their first day on the job. You know it's a pretty bad gig when folks can't even stick out a whole day, and they shouldn't have to. If you're quitting, you're quitting. Save yourself and the company some precious time and be blunt. However, the reasons these employees decided to leave their jobs, well… are astounding.",
