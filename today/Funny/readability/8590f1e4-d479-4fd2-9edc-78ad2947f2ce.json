  "description": "Almost certainly, at some point, those working shift work, or in other jobs where timesheets need to be kept, have been told by some manager not to \"bother\" reporting time that they worked over their shift because it's \"inconvenient\" for them to report it. Sometimes, this comes in the form of being told that it needs to be at least 15 minutes to be reported and counted for anything, but that's not really true—at all. If anything, if their system can't handle menial minutes overtime, then they should just be rounding up to some increment that it can handle… But you can't really go around suggesting this to your boss and the company's HR department without putting a target squarely on your back.This former restaurant worker shared how their manager had once asked them to show up 30 minutes before their shift was to start and get their things organized so that they could \"begin working\" as soon as their shift was set to start, insisting that this would make them look like a \"dedicated\" employee. The worker shares that they outright refused, calling out their manager on the spot for their proposal that they work for free when they were already only making $12 an hour. Even though this experience happened some time ago, they shared it with this online employment community, sparking discussion on the topic with other members of the community and readers.
