  "description": "When starting a completely new career, it's scary. You don't have any experience in this new work environment and you're afraid you won't know what to do. Sure, on paper you might technically not have any experience, but life isn't so black and white. Life experiences that have nothing to do with your new job might actually come very in handy. The point is, you never know! So don't be too afraid starting a new job, you might not have experience on paper, but you weren't born yesterday—you have life experience.  Take, for instance, this ex-pro female wrestler. She started working the nightshift at a new boutique hotel. Corporate sent someone to check out the staff and he said she was \"rough around the edges.\" However, he said to apply the acting that is necessary in wrestling for when she deals with guests. And guess what? It worked! But it wasn't just the acting that came in handy…",
