  "description": "The struggle of living in an HOA neighborhood only reveals itself once you are there and cannot leave. It's like a Twilight Zone where your driveway cannot have a single spot on it, and having trash feels like a dirty little secret. Someone is always watching you, and every little mistake might get you written up, or worse, fined.Those who never had to deal with the HOA might not realize how much of a burden it might be, but believe us, and thousands of frustrated residents, when we say–if you can avoid it, don't do it to yourselves. It just is not worth it.If you need further proof, all you need is to scroll down and read the story below. It is the tale of a homeowner who got fined for putting their trash can out at the end of their driveway the night before trash pickup. They didn't think it was a big deal, but the HOA eyes were watching, and they did not like what they saw.Keep scrolling to read the full story. After you are done, check out another neighborhood tale of a mother who demanded the WiFi password from their neighbor.",
