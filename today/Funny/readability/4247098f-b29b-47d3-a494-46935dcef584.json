  "description": "Good meowrning, feline friends. We all know how kittens are made, right? Well, if you don't, we'll tell you: when one mommy kitty and one daddy kitty fall in love, they get meowrried, and then a few months later, a stork comes and drops off the kittens in a cardboard box close to where they live. Well, sometimes, the storks get lost, and they leave the kittens with some unsuspecting cat-lover (the storks are obviously employees of the cat distribution system) to take care if instead of mommy and daddy.While cooking dinner one night, this unsuspecting cat-lover went to answer the door and found nothing except a take-out box. Surprised by how heavy it was, she opened the box to find five barely born kittens, some formula, and feeding bottles. Maybe it was a stork, maybe it was a hooman who couldn't take care of them, but they were her responsibility now, and she certainly stepped up. We also included an awwdorable update, so scroll down to see all these seriously smol kittens below!",
