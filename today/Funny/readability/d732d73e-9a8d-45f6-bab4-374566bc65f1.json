The young employee at the center of this unfortunate place of work spent nearly a year juggling arbitrary schedule changes, illegal timecard shenanigans, and a general manager whose favorite hobby is boundary erosion. The highlights include being scolded for not showing up to work while literally standing at the register, getting docked for fifteen minutes of labor because it was \"too late\" to fix, and being told to \"be mindful\" of a terminal illness, because apparently, passing is only acceptable if it doesn't interfere with store coverage.",
