  "description": "Not all great neighbors make great friends. We all know this to be true, and yet you would be surprised at how many supposedly mature adults in this world still want to be best friends with all the people nearby. It's a middle school mentality that some people never get over as they grow up. You do not have to be best friends with everyone who is a part of your life; as long as you show decency and respect toward one another, you should be able to peacefully coexist. If I could say that once more for the people in the back, I would.The author of this story sounds an awful lot like Chris Robinson's character in the new movie, Friendship. Once he got a taste of being pals with the guys next door, he couldn't fathom that they would want to occasionally throw parties without them. Of course, the other guys are not necessarily blameless in this story. It sounds like they could be a bit more subtle, but they are certainly not obligated to be besties with the author just because of their close proximity to one another.
