  "description": "How does your work handle latenesses? Each workplace treats them differently. At some jobs where you clock in, such as those in the retail sector, being even a minute or two late is grounds for a write-up. Those bosses expect you to be there at your start time on the dot: no exceptions! Even if traffic is bad or your kid is sick, they don't care. They just want you there on time, with zero exceptions. However, some office jobs are way more relaxed about this kind of thing. It's normal for some workers to breeze in the door a half hour after starting time, as well as leave well before 5 PM. It's one of the nice perks of working in a salaried position. But at this company, the new management decided to yank that privilege away from their workers. Not only is lateness now penalized, but the amount of time doesn't seem to matter to the bosses. Late by 2 minutes? You're in trouble. Late by 3 hours? You're still in trouble… the exact same amount of trouble, by the way. As you can imagine, the employees didn't take kindly to the new management's way of handling the situation, and decided to maliciously comply. Up next, read about this confused hotel guest who didn't understand why he couldn't \"come in at 3 AM,\" and opted to try and nap in the parking lot instead.",
