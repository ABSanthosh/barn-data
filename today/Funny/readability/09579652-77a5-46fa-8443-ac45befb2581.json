What I do have though is the knowledge that even though the future is a place we can never see clearly, so many of you hold a light up in the world…so many of you are a light in this world. We may not be able to see what comes ahead but I know that no matter what, I’m here with you…around a flickering candle that will continue to shine. And I know that when my candle goes out you’ll lend me your flame…and vice versa. That’s how hope grows. That’s how kindness spreads. Thank you for shining in a world that sometimes appears dark. It may seem such a small ember, but it glows like a lighthouse in the world, reminding us that we are so very far from being alone. I super crazy love you, ~ Jenny Post navigation",
