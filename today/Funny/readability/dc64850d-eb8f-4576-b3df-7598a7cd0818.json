  "description": "Tortoiseshell cats are lovely ladies, dashing dames, precious princesses, quality queens, wonderful women, furtastic female felines, meowgnificent madams, elegant empresses, cuddly contessas, delightful duchesses, beautiful belles. Tortoiseshell cats are cute and ameowzing, and they deserve all the love they demand. Some of them may demand more love than others, though. Some tortoiseshell ladies are aloof and formal, but some are so cuddly they become clingy.Some tortoiseshell cat pawrents were asked - are their tortie princesses love to cuddle? Are they clingy or show love from afar? Do they like to use you as a palanquin while you chauffer them around on demand? All these good ladies have a splendid spectrum of cuddly to clingy, even if some are a little out of it, to either direction. If you're a cat pawrent yourself, and even more so if you're a tortoiseshell cat pawrent, you understand the delicate balance between making your feline dame happy, and the desire to cuddle her endlessly.",
