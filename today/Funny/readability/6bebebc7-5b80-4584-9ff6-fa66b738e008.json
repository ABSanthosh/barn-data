  "description": "Black cats are a blessing. It is long rumored that black cats bring bad luck, but nothing could be further from the truth. Black cats are a true blessing of cuteness, beauty, and lots of feline funnies. We asked the black cat pawrents around the office why having a black cat is such a blessing, and these are our favorite answers, in no particular order:\"I was gaming in the dark and was sure my cat was lounging next to me on the table. Every time I lost, I talked it through with my cat, like she was there to help me through the frustration. After I turned the game off, I realized I was talking to my crumpled black sweatshirt all along.\" \"A couple of nights ago, I was about to fall asleep when I felt my absolute unit of a cat jump onto the bed. He usually does that when I'm falling asleep, so I was not surprised, but this time - he was climbing onto my chest, putting his face an inch from mine, and releasing the loudest meow out of his mouth. I opened my eyes in horror and saw nothing but his glowing eyes in the darkness of his fur and the room. With his chonker weight pressing on my chest, I thought that this is what paralysis demon must feel like.\" \"My partner and I were looking for my void cat everywhere for a few minutes, just because I wondered where she could be. We called her name a few times, and nothing. She doesn't usually respond to her name, but we walked around the house, looking in her usual hiding spots and napping places, we couldn't find her. I started worrying, but then my partner called me and pointed to the turned-off TV - lo and behold, my cat was just sitting in front of the black screen in complete camouflage. Panic averted.\"",
