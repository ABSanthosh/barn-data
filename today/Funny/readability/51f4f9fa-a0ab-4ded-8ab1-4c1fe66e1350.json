  "description": "Office life comes with its share of annoyances: that one person who microwaves fish, the colleague who tells the same story daily, and the printer that works exclusively through prayer. But nothing quite compares to the special torment of dealing with an entitled child using the workplace as their personal playground while their parent watches with the observational skills of a brick wall. It's a uniquely torturous situation where professional adults suddenly find themselves playing unwilling, and unpaid babysitters, forced to protect their belongings like they're guarding the crown jewels from a tiny, runny-nosed, sticky-fingered bandit. Everyone has to tiptoe around the (t)issue because confronting a parent about their precious angel's behavior is about as pleasant as getting a root canal while listening to the same kid practice the bagpipe. The workplace transforms into a bizarre combination of daycare and maximum security facility, with employees hiding their possessions and developing elaborate systems to protect their lunch from becoming another casualty of a child's communist philosophy.",
