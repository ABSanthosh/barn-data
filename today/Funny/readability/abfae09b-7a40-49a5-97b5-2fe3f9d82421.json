  "description": "What defines a pizza? Obviously, you've got to have the three main components: Crust, sauce, and cheese. But what pizza lovers adore about the 'zah' is that there's a liberal identity when it comes to this delicacy that allows the culinary daredevils to break free of the norm. When it comes to toppings, there are really no rules in the game. However, after seeing the pizzas on this next list, maybe there should be some rules. Although some may argue over pineapple's place as a topping on a pizza, we can all agree that an entire rotisserie chicken (bones n' all) does not belong on a pizza. Nor is breakfast cereal a suitable addition either. And Spaghetti O's are certainly not an acceptable substitution for standard sauce. From the weird to the icky, pizzas are just vessels to bring forth their creator's darkest desires. And if you're anything like me–a lover of classic pepperoni and cheese–hold onto your bibs because these pizza toppings are criminally offensive.",
