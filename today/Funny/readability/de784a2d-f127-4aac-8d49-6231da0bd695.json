  "description": "Cats, with their mysterious ways, seem to find themselves in all sorts of silly situations. And most of those situations result in some sort of consequences. But being cats, they have the superhooman ability to quickly evacuate the area in which they are about to face consequences and disappear into nothingness within the blink of an eye. But today we have gathered a group of clawminal cattos to make them face up to what they have done and live with the consequences of their actions.Whether or not they learn from the errors of their ways is a different discussion entirely, but one thing is for sure, we will finally get to see them face up to the crimes they have committed.",

  "text": "Now, while this cute catto might be wrong for not caring whether they will be loved because of their attitude. This is an example of a cat facing up to the error of their ways. The only difference is that this cat does not care that it has erred and the ways that we are judging it by are hooman and not catto. Finally, some conclusive proof that midnight, or worse still, all night zoomies have consequences that are more impactful that you might have imagined. So if you have a late night partier in your home, show them that they could end up looking like this in a matter of weeks if they keep it up.",
