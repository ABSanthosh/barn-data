  "description": "The 'trend' of people reserving spots by the pool is something that only started growing in recent years. Vacationers found out that if they put their towels on a sun chair, they could leave for however long they wanted, then come back and the chair would be theirs no matter how long have passed.This led people to plot ahead and get to the pool as soon as it opened, throw a towel on as many chairs as they wanted, then go to breakfast, do their business, and return to the chair when they were ready. This also meant that people who were actually at the pool often didn't have any chairs to use, because they were all taken by those imaginary people. Well, the vacationer in this story was not going to let this ridiculous ploy go any further. While vacationing in a resort in Australia, this guest noticed people trying out this towel 'hack', and decided to put a stop to it as soon as possible. How did they do it?
