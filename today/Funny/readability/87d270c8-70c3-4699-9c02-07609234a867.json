  "description": "Mint is one of those things that most people have positive impressions of, associating it with cool green colors, refreshingly fresh tastes and smells, and summer beverages. It even has its own ice cream flavor and is synonymous with fresh breath. Overall, most of us regard it as being almost \"friendly.\" But not gardeners and landscapers, just mention \"mint\" to them and watch them turn into one of those Mr. Incredible memes as they picture all sorts of nightmarish abject horrors caused by what is one of the hardest plants to remove from a garden or lawn once it has taken root, up there with enduring pesky persistence along with the likes of bamboo. It can even escape from pots it is planted in if that pot is placed on top of soil. Basically, you only ever plant mint intentionally if you have no idea what you're doing or really just like mint and want it to be everywhere.It can be frustrating being granted an impossible task, especially when you're facing some sort of punishment or fine for not completing it in time. That's what this homeowner found himself facing when his HOA was threatening to fine him for the brown spot he had on his grass. No matter what he tried, be it seed or sod, everything that was planted there would go brown and wither.",

And when the HOA refused to relent he decided “Well, sod it.” and researched a plant that fit the HOA requirements to \"establish adequate green coverage using appropriate plant materials for erosion control.\" Finding that mint wasn't banned in any way, he planted copious amounts of it. The rest, so they say, is history, as the aggressive plant spreads throughout the neighborhood, into other yards and common areas. Hey, at least that neighborhood probably smells fantastically fresh… And if you're ever craving a Mojito, there will always be mint for you to harvest.",
