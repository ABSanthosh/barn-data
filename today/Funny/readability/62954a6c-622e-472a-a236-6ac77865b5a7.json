  "description": "How are there people who still think that acting selfishly and entitled will get them further than acting kind and patient? All it takes is a minimum understanding of human interaction to realize that people would react much better to others being nice to them instead of being mean. When it comes to interaction with someone who is supposed to provide you with a service of some kind, these statements go a long way. Take this Reddit story as an example–These two local bakers had to deal with a Karen customer who constantly tried to get discounts and free desserts. She was a regular customer and thought that by acting out and being mean to the bakers, she could get her way, when in reality all she had to do was the complete opposite. Eventually, Karen tried to get the bakers in trouble by planting a hair in their cakes and then demanding compensation, which led the bakers to finally ban her from ordering anything in the future.Hopefully, it was a lesson learned for this Karen, but if not, at least we all could learn from it instead, so scroll down to read the full tale. After you are done, click here for a story about an employee who got in trouble because a coworker stole her work.",
