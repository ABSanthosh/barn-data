  "text": "You might be as surprised as we were to learn that dreaded continuity could rear its ugly and reptilian head. Like the mudfish, it had gone dormant in the murk and has only now begun to whip and writhe. I know that broadly speaking tariffs and international monetary policy are not common themes at Penny Arcade, but forces utterly outside of my control have made it something I have to discuss because if you engage in business you're going to find your leg caught in one of these snares. As this is the Internet, and it happens literally every time anything happens, people have reached within and discovered a rich storehouse of financial wisdom they never exhibited before. Obviously, I love to exhibit wisdom myself. Huge fan. But companies that make Boardgames are specifically and uniquely in the teeth of this thing, and I think you should listen to outfits like Stonemaier Games and Steve Jackson Games before you try mainlining any AI generated economic Lysenkoism. This #Fridabe is more of a #Frigabe, as the SSD that hosts his operating system decided not to exist anymore. This makes things hard for a bunch of reasons, but specifically in this case Dabe has a lot of work to do to make OBS work. The O and the S are fine, but the B part is iffy. So! We'll do our typical Rivalry starting at 10:45am, with Gabriel's sure hand at the tiller. See you then! (CW)TB out.",
