They just announced free DLC to celebrate, shit must be going well over there. It's got all the usual survival RPG stuff, but if you go to chop wood or whatever - I have to pause to consider here just how many virtual trees I've laid low over my career - gathering works a little different in FLi. It's essentially a battle you're undertaking, just with your job tool, such as an axe or a hoe. And you have an abilities schedule that lets you in on where the \"enemy\" (again, I'm talking about a tree) has a weak point. I could have said skill tree instead of abilities schedule but I'd already thought the word \"tree\" so many times by this point that it started to make my frontal cortex itch. Welcome to my mind. But, yes: all the traditional engagement metaphors are here, plus minigames, they just might… you know. Look a little weird. #Fridabe has returned, so listen for the peal of the horns. He hasn't ever fucked around with Monster Train II, so I'm gon' learn 'im. Then, we'll head back to Indy at noon ro so for more combat archaeology. See you around ten or so! (CW)TB out.",
