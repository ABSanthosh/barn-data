  "description": "Listen to your elders… Otherwise, you might end up like this guy, who had some massive fines to pay off! There are some things in life that just get worse if you ignore them, and fines are one of those things. For example, if you get your car impounded, you can just leave it there if you can't afford to get it out right away. But then you start accruing daily fees that add up to cost more and more money. Naturally, most people who get their car towed want it back ASAP, and they throw up their hands and just pay the big fine to avoid paying all those little extra fines. This dude happened to incur a fine… and then he left for quite a while. Oh no… His neighbor knew all about it, though, but he wasn't going to push the issue after the dude was impolite to him. This guy learned a very expensive lesson, which you can read all about down below. After that, read about the dude who's confronting their 25-year-old GF because she keeps bringing ChatGPT into their personal arguments: 'She needs to stop.'",
