It's not just, like, for Prime Video or something. They're gonna make a real movie and stuff. I was originally going to say something along the lines of \"do you want megacorps? Because this is how you get megacorps\" in the Cyberpunk sense. But there's no irony to be had; that's basically what it is. All they're really missing is the standing army, I suppose, which - along with tender subsidies - is one of the only things it needs to keep a traditional government for. They have different tests for determining if you can buy another company, but I think there should be a line item on the sheet that just says \"does it seem kinda weird, though?\" with a little box you can check for yes. If it's not weird, no check is required. I don't know why the same locus of power should contain robots and security and film production and groceries and have a newspaper and also be a grocery store and a pharmacy. The FCC's job is to protect us from monsters, but it only recognizes monsters it's seen before. As long as you make one piece by piece, like Frankenstein, it's totally cool to do. (CW)TB out.",
