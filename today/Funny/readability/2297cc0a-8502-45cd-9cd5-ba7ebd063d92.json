  "description": "It's the spooky season once again, and the internet is ready to celebrate with some of their funniest and shortest horror stories. Could you tell a scary story in just six words? It's harder than it looks! We all know the classic short sad story, \"For sale: baby shoes, never worn,\" written by Ernest Hemingway. The sentence has become a meme online, with plenty of people changing up the template to make their own jokey version of the story (\"For sale: baby shoes, quite haunted,\" is just one example!). Although Hemingway nailed it with his classic story, it can be hard to think of something sad or scary that can be conveyed in so few words. But that didn't stop the internet from trying anyway!Though the challenge of creating a horror story in just six words isn't as easy as it seems, these X users took the Halloween challenge in stride! But also, a lot of people wrote their own funny versions of @MammonsGreedy's prompt too, and you can check out some of the funniest ones down below. After that, read about this bold grandfather who \"pretended to be on a secret mission… for 20 years\" in order to get a tiny bit more food from his favorite restaurant.",
