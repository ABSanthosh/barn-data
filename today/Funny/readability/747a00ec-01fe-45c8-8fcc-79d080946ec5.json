  "description": "Cats… are regal creatures. Cats and their beauty cannot be impeded. They are independent, they don't need no human, they can take care of themselves, and they never - and mean never - get caught in any moment in which they are any less than purrfect. Or at least that's what they think. And we are sure that they think that. You can see it on their faces. The superiority, thinking that they are better than us, that they are without any impurrfection. But we see through them. We, as cat owners who watch our cats almost every minute of every day, who have our cameras pointed at them as often as we open our phones, we see our cats' derpy moments. They can't hide themselves from our watchful eyes. And every time we see it, every time we catch our cats being their silly selves, we take a photo as fast as we can. Because, as you are going to see today, these photos are awesome.",
