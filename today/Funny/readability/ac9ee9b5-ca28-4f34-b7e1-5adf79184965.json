  "description": "Sunday meowrning, and we are in a good mood. We don't know why. Nothing specific has happened. In fact, we think that maybe we should be in a worst mood, considering some stuff that is happening, but we are not. We are chill, it is Sunday, and we have decided to take fate into our own hands and make sure that next week is going to be a friggin' fabulous one for us, no matter what else may be happening. And the first step to make that happen is enjoying a bunch of hissterical cat memes first thing in the morning. Every single week, we bring you a bunch of silly new cat memes to laugh at directly from the depths of X, or Twitter, or however you want to call this platform. We bring it to you because the content there is and furrever will be iconic. So, sit back, enjoy the extra time that you can spend resting in bed or drinking your coffee, and have a purrfect day!",

Stop this madness while you still can!  One thing we did not expect to write about this week was Paris Hilton rescuing cats. Don't know why. She's been pretty awesome lately, but this… this has taken her to the next level in our eyes. Keep up the good work.",
