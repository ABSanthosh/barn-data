It’s possible you missed the Lookouts short film that was made a while back so I’ll go ahead and drop a link to it here. Jerry and I were blown away when we first saw it and I still think it shows how much promise the Eyrewood has beyond comics.  The Lookouts started things off but their world quickly expanded to include the Daughters of the Eyrewood and the Thornwatch. If you’ve never read them or it has been a minute, you can read all our various tales from the Eyrewood right here.  -Gabe Out",
