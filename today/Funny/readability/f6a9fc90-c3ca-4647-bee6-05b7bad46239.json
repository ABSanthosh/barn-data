  "description": "It is no big secret that our cute cat children are masters of many things. From the theft of food from right under our noses, to mind-bending leaps that defy the very laws of physics, to singing the songs of their people. There is hardly a thing in the world that our clever cattos do not excel at. And one of those special qualities is their ability to sleep in some of the strangest and silliest positions known to man. The kind of poses that hurt your back just to look at them, let alone to imagine falling asleep in them for several hours.And today we wanted to celebrate these creative sleepers with this list of cats who turn nap time into an Olympic sport of peculiar poses. So get your pen and paper out and get ready to judge this fierce feline competition. Just be prepawed for a feisty response from the losers.",

  "text": "This one is rather peculiar, not for the position so much, as the choice to bury its nose in a smelly shoe which even a dumb doggo would probably avoid engulfing themselves with. But one thing is for sure, when this catto wakes up, there will be no smell on earth that will bother them.  Honestly, what more could you want in life. You are comfortable, you are cozy, you are supported rather well by the place you decided to fall asleep in. and as a cat if you the worst were to happen and you begin to fall you can always sleep with your claws clamped into the couch.",
