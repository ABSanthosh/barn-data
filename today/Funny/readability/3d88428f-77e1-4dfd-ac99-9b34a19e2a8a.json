  "description": "You can't pick your coworkers, and sometimes, it feels like the universe is playing a cruel trick on you with the folks management decides to hire. Whether you're a new employee facing the harsh reality of your new incompetent coworkers or you're a seasoned vet taking in the absurdity of yet another unfit new hire, you know this struggle a little too well. You might've gotten stuck with the colleague who swoops in at the last second and takes all the credit for your work, or the colleague who takes five to seven business days to reply to a simple email, or even worse, the office food thief who swipes your lunch like it's no big deal. But how do you handle a coworker who doubles as a litterbug? That's a new one.This story takes the office drama to the streets (literally) when one coworker decided to toss his coffee cup out the car window during while carpooling to work, completely disregarding the driver's plea not to. Instead of turning a blind eye, the driver put an immediate stop to it (again, literally). What followed was a cold, awkward, and very expensive journey to the office for the litterbug.",
