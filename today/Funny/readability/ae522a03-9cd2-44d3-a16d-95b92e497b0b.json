  "description": "Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is the kind of life-sim, Steam Charts pervert game I have a hard time engaging with. Well, that's not true. It's that I engage with one tiny part of it obsessively and then I have a sixty dollar game I've eaten the nuts and chewies out of and the rest of the box gets thrown in the garbage. It's like Disgaea Item Worlds; that just becomes the whole game. I watched somebody make a sword in KC:D2 and sharpen it, and though it didn't take the amount of time it would actually take it took a long-ass motherfuckin' time. Long enough to lose myself meditatively in the quenching, perhaps. Hmm. Hmm.",

In the sequel apparently the sword-quenching has gone a bridge too far.  The first Kingdom Come: Deliverance game was \"based,\" which gave it the traditional enemies within the media sphere, but now that this second game has gay sex in barns they've earned the ire of the \"based\" cohort who bolstered them the first time around. I talked a little bit about this before, Sites of Conflict, and I should emphasize that the reason I tend not to engage with this type of shit is that it routinely turns into a purity spiral exactly like the one we can observe here, with the most fervent voices engaging in manipulative, dogmatic loyalty tests of various kinds. It's not that I don't think there are important issues at play, that's not it - it's that I can clock a fucking preacher man from a mile away. My allergy is to Dogma, which cannot hope to truly describe the world as it is and thus has limited utility - unless you're trying to engage in manipulative, dogmatic loyalty tests. Then, it's super useful. I can't actually win in these contexts; I'll never be pure enough for either side. It is here that the WOPRs great wisdom rings out, yea, through the ages. (CW)TB out.",
