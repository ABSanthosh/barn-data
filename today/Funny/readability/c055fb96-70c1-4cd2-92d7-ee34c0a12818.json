  "description": "This coworker has a weird fixation. For some strange reason, he cannot stop thinking about his coworker's college degree. And he isn't just thinking about it: he's been constantly bugging them about it. This is an odd story, because unless you work in academia, almost no one cares about your college degree. It matters that you went to a college and graduated with a degree for many high-paying jobs. Usually, the hiring manager or HR team will determine that kind of information before hiring you. But apparently there's a decent amount of people who just straight-up lie about their college degrees during interviews! If they can still get jobs that way, then clearly the degree isn't all that's needed to succeed in the workplace. A lot of your successes will be built on good communication, savvy networking, and being known as a competent and skilled individual. This person's coworker has a really weird fixation on their college degree, which makes him look petty and weird. You can check out the full tale below, as well as read the advice from the commenters who were shaking their head at this guy's audacity. Up next, check out some really awkward reasons people gave for breaking up with their significant others, like one person who \"said they needed to 'focus on their plants.'\"",
