  "text": "I think that it's okay to do things for money, especially if you're really good at them. For example, if you are A Russo Brother - either one - I would absolutely love it if they came back and made a cool Marvel movie. Disney certainly doesn't know how. Disney has been wandering in the fucking woods since Endgame, and the movie that called them out for doing exactly that made 1.3 billion dollars. I want these Russo gentlemen back because they made Captain America: Winter Soldier. That's why I wanted them to do the other stuff; because they make good things. I don't need some kind of substrate underneath it. It's a craft. They're the masters of it. That's plenty for me. Disney's gotta do something. Their output on Marvel and Star Wars - which we woulda thought were sure things - have been abraded by incredibly uneven product for years now. Skeleton Crew kicks fucking ass, but the trust is just gone. Nobody will even know. Durty Dwab is back with another #Fridabe extravaganza, where we'll be getting down with the new season of Rivals until noon or so, then we'll check the temp. If everybody is still having fun, we can just carry through until the end of the stream at 2pm. If it feels like a change is in order, we're gonna see what's going on with this Indiana Jones shit from MachineGames. People are super freaking out about it and now I'm too curious. But yeah! Come hang from ten or so on right at the traditional haunt. (CW)TB out.",
