  "description": "It's that time again. The time of Christmas trees and lights and joy and chaos. So much chaos. Specifically to cat owners. Because everyone knows that for some reason, every year, cats decide to have a war with Christmas. Or maybe it's not a war. Maybe it's love that's making cats get inside of Christmas trees the second that they are put up. But everyone knows that love can lead to chaos, and the same is true for cats and Christmas trees.And so, another year, and the madness continues. It's only the beginning of December, and not all of us have put up their trees yet, but the ones of us who decided to start the party a little earlier than most are already experiencing the meowgic of Christmas, because cats don't care how early, they will get up on those Christmas trees and make sure that the party starts instantly.",
