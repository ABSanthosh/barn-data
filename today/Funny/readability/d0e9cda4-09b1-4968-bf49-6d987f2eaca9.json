  "text": "I had put up a preview of the first panel, and Best Buy stalwarts swooped in from their blue and gold aerie to let me know that Best Buy doesn't have jungle plants growing inside - nor does it have a gouge taken out of the roof, where warm Summer rains might dance and drip down the gnawed-out scaffolds and steel bones of the retail pit. I don't think I've stepped foot in one for coming up on a decade, and it had been a site of last resort for a while - the third or fourth choice. Choices one through three are all websites. The last time I was there I think it was literally to buy the original Switch. If megafauna like Best Buy still roam your lands, I'm overjoyed to hear it. The last time I was in one, my voice echoed like it would in a cathedral. A mount of burning televisions played a video of fire until they were consumed by it. For today's tender #Fridabe, I feel like we gotta check out this Ultron shit in Rivals - at least at first. But ever since our last round of The Bazaar on stream, I've been starved for it. This is one of those \"how could I possibly not have known about this game\" moments, and if you lean more toward my side than Gabes - if you have a dark need for the autobattler, the roguelike - you can take a tour of it with us around noon or so on the stream. Holy shit. (CW)TB out.",
