  "description": "Whether you're a real homeowner or an aspiring one with a vision board the size of a house, these memes will get a good laugh out of you. It's not a shock to anyone that the interest rates for owning property including mortgage, financing, etc. are high. I rent, I am 23 years old, and live in New York City, so I'm a bit unfamiliar with the average homeowner's day-to-day. I can only imagine that it's something like this: Looking around for something to fix, fixing it, finding something else to fix, fixing that, then getting frustrated with both fix-up jobs and taking all of your fix-ups away. Is that accurate? As a renter, I call my landlord and beg them to do something. At least all I have to do is pick up the phone…If you're feeling down about being a homeowner because we all have those days, these memes will perk you right up and remind you why you chose to live the dream. Dreamin and memein'.",

  "text": "In 2020, most interest rates were low because, well, nobody had money. Many aspiring homeowners with a fat savings account and something to prove decided to dive head-first into the world of homeownership, and man are they lucky they did so. The interest rates were chump change. Now, you're lucky to buy a Barbie Dream House without getting obliterated by sales tax. Inflation station over here. If you already have a home, you're probably scrounging around for extra dough to pay off the beefy electric bill you had this month. Is it ever a win-win? Well, let these memes help you decide.",
