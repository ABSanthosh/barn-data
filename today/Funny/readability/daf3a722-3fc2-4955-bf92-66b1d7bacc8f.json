  "description": "Grab the popcorn: there's friendship drama going down over a broken laptop. You know your childhood bestie who you swore you'd be BFFs with forever, but now you text her like twice a year? Or maybe you have a friend who you used to love grabbing dinner with a few times a month, but now this person has a whole new friend group? Yeah, a friendship breakup often hurts bad, and there may not even be a good reason for it. You may just outgrow each other's company, and realize that you no longer get along anymore. It's painful (some would say it's worse than a breakup). These friends are having their falling-out over an ill-fated broken MacBook… check out the full tale, as well as an update, down below. Next, read the story of the hair salon customer who wouldn't plunk down a tip on a $950 hair service, leading the cashier to tell her she's \"not welcome back.\"",
