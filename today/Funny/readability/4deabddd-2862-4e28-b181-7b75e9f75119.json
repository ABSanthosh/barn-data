  "description": "Many people are aware that roughly 40% of marriages end in divorce. But that doesn't deter most lovebirds from going to the alter. They're not pondering divorces, they're celebrating their love and thinking, \"Divorce happens to other people's marriages. My spouse and I will beat the odds, love each other forever, and figure out a way to make any disagreement work out.\" But as much as a couple tries to make their relationship work, there are issues that can't be fixed, and sometimes people end up happier on their own. Some couples even joke that their relationships improve once they split up, but it's kind of true. Sure, there's the heartbreak and woes, yada yada yada. The good news? You get to sleep in a bed by yourself, eat whatever you want whenever you want, no one is monitoring your finances or hobbies, and you won't have the stressors that caused the breakup in the first place. You can see your friends more than before, maybe get a pet or two, and there's nothing like a fresh start in your own house or apartment to make you feel brand new again.",
