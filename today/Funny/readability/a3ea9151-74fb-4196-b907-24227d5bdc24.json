  "description": "If you've ever looked at moving away from your hometown family, you'll hear a lot from your relatives about how it's going to be harder living somewhere away from them and without the \"family support system.\" Those who are of an age where they might be considering having children will hear a lot of this. Particularly from expectant would-be grandparents who don't want their grandchildren growing up somewhere away from them.While this might seem like a scam to keep you nearby, they have a legitimate point. It really is a lot harder when you're living somewhere without close family nearby, and it's important to remember here that as soon as kids enter the picture, the phrase \"family support system\" really means one thing: free child care. (Story continues below)This is something people tend to take for granted when they have it. Like this older sister did in a story shared by her younger sister to this popular online community. See, it's really hard to convince people to look after your children, even if they are of your own flesh and family.",
