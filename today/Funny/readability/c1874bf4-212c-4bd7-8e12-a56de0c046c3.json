These perverts at NetEase would see every day devoted to humping if they could, stripping Wednesday of its traditional remit. This is the strongest launch I've seen of a game since I don't know when. Their first full battlepass - which doesn't trade on FOMO and can, Halo Infinite style, be earned through whenever you want - has ten skins for ten dollars. It's batshit. It's generosity so incandescent that it borders on aggression. They've essentially buffed my main DPS, The Punisher, by increasing the damage of his primary weapons. Maybe there is some rarified upper echelon where these weapons aren't killing people, but that has not been my experience. And they buffed Rocket Raccoon, which Dabe and kara both play, to both heal better and also lowered the cooldown on a combo device he has that makes Punisher and Winter Soldier fire faster and, um, never have to reload? Maybe I'm lucky because this creature is often in my comps, but I can't wait to give this thing a try. We'll be streamin' it up for Patch Day Vibes out into the afternoon on twitch.tv/pennyarcade if you feel like some company. (CW)TB out.",
