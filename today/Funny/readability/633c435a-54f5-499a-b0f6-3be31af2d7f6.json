  "description": "Grade A parenting doesn't have to be learned from a book or class—it doesn't even have to be passed down from generation to generation. If can simply come from showing your character in the heat of the moment. True, that can go either way, but sometimes it can be epic. Take, for example, this beautiful father and son bonding moment. It blossomed out of a situation sparked by some entitled dude at a gas station. He pulled up behind them in a big 'ole truck and decided they were taking too long pumping their gas. So while the son was inside getting snacks and the dad was cleaning the windows as the gas was pumping, this entitled guy puffed out his chest and took the gas pump right out of their car!",

The dad agreed with his son, and they just drove off. As they were driving away, however, the son showed his dad a shinning keychain of keys. It turns out, while that entitled guy was being a Karen, the other guy's son snuck into his truck and took the keys right out of the ignition.
