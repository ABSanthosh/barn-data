But if they're justing their blender to make smoothies for breakfast while you're trying to sleep in, it's unfortunate, but just something that happens. I forget the comedian who made this joke, but he said that all New Yorkers have an unwritten agreement to pretend like they don't hear each other getting freaky in bed, and as an apartment dweller in NYC, I couldn't agree more! Here, we have one neighbor taking things to a whole new petty level after she got one too many noise complaints for normal everyday activity. You see, he worked the nightshift, and she was an early riser. So when she was up at 6am, he was just going to bed. Instead of trying to compromise, they both went for throats, and now she's getting up at 6am to practice opera…",
