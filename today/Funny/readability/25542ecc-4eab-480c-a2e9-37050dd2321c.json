  "description": "As a recent adult, going home for the holidays is always a special treat. You never have to worry about where you'll find your next meal, you can sleep in until noon snuggled up in your childhood bed, and maybe even the family dog will nestle in with you to keep you warm. Sure, some annoying family dynamics are bound to arise, but it's all worth it for some much-needed rest and relaxation. Going away from home makes these luxuries even more delicious. You don't realize how much you miss your family until you are living on your own, experiencing the freedom of adulthood you've always longed for.It's easy to feel afraid of leaving home. The world outside is big and scary, and learning how to take care of yourself is one of the hardest things a person can achieve. However, if you never leave home, you run the risk of never reaching your full personhood. In this story, a father is facing that moment with his son, who is refusing to grow up. Will OP's firm hand drive his son away, or will it be a much-needed wake-up call for a person in need of a kick in the pants?",
