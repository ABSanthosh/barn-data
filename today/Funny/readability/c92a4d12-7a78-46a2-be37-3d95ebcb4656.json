  "description": "Desperate times call for desperate measures, but desperate measures do not always pan out. In this day and age, who among us has not come into contact with an online scammer or a choosing beggar on the internet? These are the folks who lurk around on sites like Facebook Marketplace, desperately hoping to find the next innocent soul they can cheat, scam, and manipulate. In this instance, we are dealing with an entitled choosing beggar who claimed she did not have the resources fill her holiday stockings with gifts for her kids. An online seller, who shared this story from his own perspective, agreed to help out. After some back and forth, the two agreed upon $250 for a same-day pickup order, an audacious request that was already a generous one to fulfill. By the time their meeting approached in which the sale was to be completed, the choosing beggar revealed that she had no plans to pay this guy and instead thought she could appeal to his emotions to get all of her requested gifts and items for free!",
