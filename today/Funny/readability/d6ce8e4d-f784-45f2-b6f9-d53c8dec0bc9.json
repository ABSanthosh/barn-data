Just as frequently, the request will get lost for a very long time, only to sheepishly surface much later. Thanks so much to this mysterious donor man, who had a couple suggestions and a heroic self insert as his wish. We are only too happy to oblige! Child's Play's mission continues apace, after an explosive PAX East and the placement of our very first Game Specialist in Scotland. It's all made possible by your donations, and we're inspired by your faith.",
