  "text": "Having crushed Space Marine 2 beneath my ceramite heel, I'm now in a position to observe Gabe rolling hard on his own playthrough. It's just very, very good. Because it is essentially Sci-Fi Catholicism, with all the gothic majesty and ritual that might suggest, large portions of it take place in church. What I'm trying to get at is that The Candle Budget goes pretty crazy in the worlds of the Imperium, in a time and place where swinging sacred incense in a thurible is part of routine engine maintenance. The whole thing is so dense, with so many odd angles, that I can't help but like it. It works as satire and, because the best satire must fully and truly understand its subject, it also works as an exemplar of a baroque science fiction. You can tell it wry or tell it straight and it works either way. Oh, and if you are a newcomer to the setting and you want to know more about why you're fighting vaguely Egyptian sarcophaguys all the sudden, I go into their lore a bit just as a primer so you know to feel a sense of tragic, fraternal loss when you press the Execute button. Obviously, there's books and books and books about this stuff. So! If you are a #SpaceMarine2 gamer who plays electronic games, and not a gamer who plays physical wargames, there might be aspects of the Thousand Sons and their mercurial commander in the videoame that may not make sense originally. It's cooler than you know! — Tycho Brahe (@TychoBrahe) September 23, 2024 Their traditional enemy is not the Ultramarines usually, but another, different set of blue guys called Space Wolves. There's an incredible book called Prospero Burns about the complexities of their relationship but it's literally the fifteenth book in a series that has… I don't even know how many it has. Have I read them? Yes. I just didn't count them as I was doing so. I don't even wanna know. Just as an index of the excess: the last book, the final one of the series? It's three separate books. There's a couple weeks left to grab a copy of Clank! Legacy 2: Acquisitions Incorporated, Dash Darkest Magic. My friend Gabe drew the cover! WOW! (CW)TB out.",
