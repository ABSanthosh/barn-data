  "description": "Sometimes people choose to take the job they did because of all of the perks. For example, I used to work at a media outlet (will leave it anonymous) that provided many extra benefits for their employees. Catered lunches every day, nap breaks, tons of PTO, and lots and lots of wiggle room on expenses. If you were traveling for work, you could basically expense everything you did during that trip. Like, you decided to go to an expensive concert while you are in that city for a business conference? Expensed and not even questioned. Literally crazy thought, because not many companies do that. Why? Because that will bankrupt the company. And guess what? That place went bankrupted and shut down… So yeah, if you're even a business credit card, make sure to use it wisely.  Some employees, however, know that they are supposed to use their business expenses wisely, but still try to get away with using it like their personal checking account. A Redditor started a thread asking people what was the craziest personal expense they witnessed trying to be pulled off as a business expense after he saw someone try to expense a deck being built in their backyard for work. People really had some crazy things to add!",
