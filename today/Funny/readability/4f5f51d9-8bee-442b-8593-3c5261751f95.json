  "description": "We all like a good clothing deal, but there's a time and a place for bartering, especially at a local small business. There's a certain appreciation and care one should have entering a place where the items were handcrafted and made with love. But unfortunately, we live in a world where some people don't understand this in the slightest and will go to strange lengths to get what they want.If you've ever worked in retail or the service, you've definitely had the pleasure of handling unhappy customers who throw the most ridiculous requests at you. It's as if they see you wearing a uniform and suddenly their respect and social cues go out the window. This brave shopkeeper in particular had to handle the worst of the worst – an Instagram micro-influencer. Apparently, having more than a thousand followers on Instagram can inflate a person's ego like a balloon, as this boutique employee saw.",
