  "text": "A 24-year-old book holds a family secret We’ve learned quite a lot of Simpson family history over the past 36 years — from Homer’s mother Mona’s past Weather Underground-esque protests, to Marge’s father’s pioneering work as a male flight attendant. Then, of course, there’s Homer’s half-brother Uncy Herb, who was last seen in the glitchy A.I.-generated “series finale” along with Uncy John Cena.  Although, in retrospect, we’ve heard frustratingly little about Bart’s Uncle Arthur, whose unspoken horrors have haunted the show ever since Marge briefly alluded to them back in Season Seven. There were also all the random dum-dums suffering from the defective “Simpson gene,” which Lisa, to her great relief, discovers only impacts the men in the family.   But as a Simpsons fan recently shared on Reddit, we once got a much bigger look at the fictional clan’s genealogical history, in the form of full family trees for both the Simpsons and the Bouviers on Marge’s side. Perhaps not surprisingly, Uncle Arthur is nowhere to be found. The family tree was included as part of the 1991 tie-in book The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album, which was officially credited to Matt Groening. It’s a fake scrapbook full of photos and sentimental clippings including Homer and Marge’s wedding certificate, Bart’s baby footprints and a snapshot of Snowball 1’s homemade tombstone.The family tree illustrations appear at the very beginning and very end of the book. The Simpson one is full of previously unknown names such as Zephediah Stemple, Remus Krupp and Dewey “Square Top” Simpson. But the biggest shocker is that the family tree contains “C. Montgomery Burns.”  Yup, Mr. Burns is, apparently, a very distant relative of the Simpsons.Another fan figured out that, based on the diagram, Homer and Mr. Burns are seemingly seventh cousins. Since the town’s population is only around 60,000, that isn’t all that surprising. But come to think of it, it kind of makes sense that the Simpsons and Burnses are related, considering that Homer hit it off so well with Mr. Burns’ son Larry.And Bart took up the Burns lifestyle when he briefly became the billionaire’s sole heir. Altough this also means that Mr. Burns was violently gunned down by his own kin. Tags: News Scroll down for the next article Must Read SIGN UP FORA WEEKLYNEWSLETTER OF JOKES + TRIVIA",
