  "description": "Well, feline fans, yet another Valentine's Day has arrived and we're still choosing our cats as our dates. It's okay, we actually prefurr it. Cats are way better than hoomans anyway. Sure, they may wake us up at 5 AM every day to feed them, but they don't text us for days and then randomly ghost us, or tell us that they \"don't eat vegetables because vegetables are for women.\" No, our cats are there for us when we're feeling down, when we're happy, and are actually way better cuddlers than any of the hoomans we've met.So this year, we're skipping the Valentine's Day drama by staying in and scrolling through some pawsitively hissterical cat posts instead. It's us on the couch with our cats, a pizza, and reruns of our current favorite binge-watch. It's better than getting all dressed up and braving the winter weather, just to be disappointed a few hours later. If you've read this far, we prrrobably didn't even need to convince you anyway. Enjoy!",

Next thing you know he'll say something like “Meeeeooooowwwww, meow, meow\" which roughly translates to “No babe, don't worry, we don't have to go anywhere or do anything. Let's just stay inside and chill.” He always knows the right things to say! Sure, having your cat as your Valentine's date does come with a few downsides. You have to share all your food with them, they need a lot of physical affection, and they do not tolerate tardiness. Especially around dinner time.",
