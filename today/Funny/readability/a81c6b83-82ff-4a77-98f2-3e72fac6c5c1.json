I’ve been a bit of a wreck lately and part of that is another bout of pernicious anemia (which absolutely sounds like a Lemony Snicket disease) and also some other autoimmune disease (BECAUSE I GUESS I DON’T HAVE ENOUGH?) that I haven’t been able to get tested for because the doctor says I’m too weak to be under anesthesia now, but with added shots and meds I’m actually feeling almost human today (FUCKING WHOOP!) and was just reading the local news when this popped up and I literally cried. I don’t know how to embed so you have to click on this but just…ow, my heart. I want to hug everyone on the Nowhere team and everyone who has ever loved us. Sometimes you don’t know how much you need some unexpected joy until it shows up. And on Saturday if you’re near San Antonio you should come to the San Antonio Book Festival because it’s free, it’s fun and it’s amazing. So many of my favorite authors are going to be there doing talks and signings. I’ll be there at 10am interviewing comedian Aida Rodriguez about her incredible book, Legitimate Kid and then I’ll be in the Nowhere tent right afterward. Come say hi, or just wave from afar if you’re an introvert like me. I’ll be hiding under a table probably. Post navigation",
