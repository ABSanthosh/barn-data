  "description": "You rarely see revenge and generosity go hand-in-hand, but this disgruntled employee found a way to get back at his greedy ex-CEO, while also donating to the poor. Clothes are 100% recyclable. I'm a big supporter of thrift shopping for clothes or finding old gems in the donation bin. Just because someone wore a shirt or a hoodie before you did doesn't mean it's soiled forever! A lot of clothing has a whole new life after it leaves its original owner. Donated clothes can be a lifeline for desperate people in need, literally putting a shirt on their backs and helping clothe their new outlook on life. Funnily enough, the guy in this next story was excited to do his part to help the local homeless population after he was wrongfully terminated and denied his bonus. Instead of egging his boss's luxury car or slandering his ex-company on Linkedin, he decided to passively besmirch them by donating all of his company merch to the homeless shelter outside his office. With a recognizable logo like theirs, the executives were reminded daily who was representing their company on the streets.",
