  "description": "Hotel work is not easy work. Even the big, expensive, fancy pants ones have their list of issues. But everyone knows to be extra wary of the cheap side-of-the-road ones. The ones that have the \"vacancy\" sign haphazardly hanging from their marquee with an ominous feel to it. Those are the ones you need to steer clear of. But what about those ones that meet you halfway? They're not the cheapest, but they're definitely not the most expensive. Unfortunately, you can very easily think you're getting a good deal, but in fact, you are getting something that might leave you traumatized. Take for example, this hotel an employee ranted about on Reddit. The place is not the cheapest, it costs $100 or more a night to stay there. So why is it that most of the rooms have sewage backups, bedbugs, or a broken AC? Why is it that they don't even have a license to run the place? Because they have just been able to get away with it, for this long… Until now. The employee had it one day after several unlawful check-ins and called the Health Inspector. When they showed up he not only fully cooperated and provided a skeleton key, but he also gave them a list of rooms that are still available to book but are absolutely fowl. You better believe this health inspector found a disgusting amount of violations. Good for that employee! Read the whole situation below.",
