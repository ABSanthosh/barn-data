  "description": "One thing I've learned by going through our reader submissions over the years is that WTFs never start with just one mistake. They're a compounding sequence of systemic failures. When we have a \"bad boss\" story, where an incompetent bully puts an equally incompetent sycophant in charge of a project, it's never just about the bad boss- it's about the system that put the bad boss in that position. For every \"Brillant\" programmer, there's a whole slew of checkpoints which should have stopped them before they went too far. With all that in mind, today we're doing a news roundup about the worst boss of them all, the avatar of Dunning-Kruger, Elon Musk. Because over the past month, a lot has happened, and there are enough software and IT related WTFs that I need to talk about them. For those who haven't been paying attention, President Trump assembled a new task force called the \"Department of Government Efficiency\", aka \"DOGE\". Like all terrible organizations, its mandate is unclear, its scope is unspecified, and its power to execute is unbounded. Now, before we get into it, we have to talk about the name. Like so much of Musk's persona, it's an unfunny joke. In this case, just a reference to Dogecoin, a meme currency based on a meme image that Musk has \"invested\" in. This is part of a pattern of unfunny jokes, like strolling around Twitter headquarters with a sink, or getting your product lines to spell S3XY. This has nothing to do with the news roundup, I just suspect that Musk's super-villain origin story was getting booed off the stage at a standup open-mic night and then he got roasted by the emcee. Everything else he's ever done has been an attempt to convince the world that he's cool and popular and funny. On of the core activities at DOGE is to be a \"woodchipper\", as Musk puts it. Agencies Musk doesn't like are just turned off, like USAID. The United States Agency for International Development handles all of the US foreign aid. Now, there's certainly room for debate over how, why, and how much aid the US provides abroad, and that's a great discussion that I wouldn't have here. But there's a very practical consideration beyond the \"should/should not\" debate: people currently depend on it. Farmers in the US depend on USAID purchasing excess crops to stabilize food prices. Abroad, people will die without the support they've been receiving. Even if you think aid should be ended entirely, simply turning off the machine while people are using it will cause massive harm. But none of this should come as a surprise, because Musk loves to promote his \"algorithm\". Calling it an \"algorithm\" is just a way to make it sound smarter than it is; what Musk's \"algorithm\" really is is a 5-step plan of bumper-sticker business speak that ranges from fatuous to incompetent, and not even the fawning coverage in the article I linked can truly disguise it. For example, step 1 is \"question every requirement\", which is obvious- of course, if you're trying to make this more efficient, you should question the requirements. As a sub-head on that, though, Musk says that requirements should be traceable directly to individuals, not departments. On one hand, this could be good for accountability, but on the other, any sufficiently complex system is going to have requirements that have to be built through collaboration, where any individual claiming the requirement is really just doing so to be a point of accountability. Step 2, also has a blindingly obvious label: \"delete any part of the process you can\". Oh, very good, why didn't I think of that! But Musk has a \"unique\" way of figuring out what parts of the process can be deleted: \"You may have to add them back later. In fact, if you do not end up adding back at least 10 percent of them, then you didnâ€™t delete enough.\" Or, to put it less charitably: break things, and then unbreak them when you realize what you broke, if you do. We can see how this plays out in practice, because Musk played this game when he took over Twitter. And sure, it's revenue has collapsed, but we don't care about that here. What we care about are stupid IT stories, like the new owner renting a U-Haul and hiring a bunch of gig workers to manually decommission an expensive data center. Among the parts of the process Musk deleted were: Shutting down the servers in an orderly fashion Using the proper tools to uninstall the server racks Protecting the flooring which wasn't designed to roll 2,500lb server racks Not wiping the hard drives which contained user data and proprietary information Not securing that valuable data with anything more than a set of Home Depot padlocks and Apple AirTags And, shockingly, despite thinking this was successful in the moment, the resulting instability caused by just ripping a datacenter out led Musk to admit this was a mistake. So let's take a look at how this plays out with DOGE. One of the major efforts was taking over the Treasury Department's IT systems. These are systems which handle $5 trillion in payments every year. And who do we put in change? Some random wet-behind-the-ears dev with a history of racist posts on the Internet. Ostensibly, they were there to \"audit\" payments, so was their access read only? Did they have admin access? Were they actually given write access? Could they change code? Nobody is entirely certain. Even if it was only read-only, there are plenty of questions about what kind of security risk that constitutes, which means forensic analysis to understand the breach, which is being called the largest data breach in history. Part of the goal was to just stop payments, following the Muskian \"Break things first, and unbreak them if it was a mistake,\" optimization strategy. Stop paying people, and if you find out you needed to pay them, then start paying them again. Step 2 of the \"algorithm\". Speaking of payments, many people in the US depend on payments from the Social Security Administration. This organization, founded in 1935 as part of the New Deal, handles all sorts of benefits, including retirement benefits. According to Musk, it's absolutely riddled with fraud. What are his arguments? Well, for starters, he worries that SSNs are not de-duplicated- that is, the same SSN could appear multiple times in the database. Social Security Administration has, since the 1940s, been trying to argue against using SSNs as identifiers for any purpose other than Social Security. They have a history page which is a delightful read as a \"we can't say the Executive Orders and laws passed which expanded the use of SSNs into domains where they shouldn't have been used was a bad idea, but we can be real salty about it,\" document. It's passive-aggression perfected. But you and I already know you should never expect SSNs to be a key. Also, assuming the SSA systems are mainframe systems, using flat file databases, we would expect a large degree of denormalization. Seeing \"unique\" keys repeated in the dataset is normal. On the same subject, Musk has decided that people over 150 years old are collecting Social Security benefits. Now, one could assume that this kind of erroneous data pattern is fraud, or we could wonder if there's an underlying reason to the pattern. Now, I've seen a lot of discussion on the Internet about this being an epoch related thing, which is certainly possible, but I think the idea that it's related to ISO8601 is obviously false- ISO8601 is just a string representation of dates, and also was standardized well after COBOL and well after SSA started computerizing. Because the number 150 was used, some folks have noted that would be 1875, and have suspected that the date of the Metre Convention is the epoch. I can't find any evidence that any of this is true, mind you, but we're also reacting to a tweet by a notorious moron, and I have to wonder: did he maybe round off 5 years? Because 1870 is exactly 65 years before 1935- the year Social Security started, and 65 years is the retirement age where you can start collecting Social Security. Thus, the oldest date which the SSA would ever care about was 1870. Though, there's another completely un-epoch related reason why you could have Social Security accounts well older than 150 years: your benefits can continue to be paid out to your spouse and dependents after your death. If an 80 year old marries a 20 year old, and dies the next day, that 20 year old could collect benefits on that account. The key point I'm making is that \"FRAUUUDDDD!!1111!!!\" is really not the correct reaction to a system you don't understand. And while there may be many better ways to handle dates within the SSA's software, the system predates computers and has needed to maintain its ability to pay benefits for 90 years. While you could certainly make improvements, what you can't do is take a big \"algorithm\" Number 2 all over it. Which, with that in mind, the idea that these people are trying to get access to a whole slew of confidential taxpayer information is I'm sure going to go *great. There are so, so many more things that could be discussed here, but let's close with the DOGE website. Given that DOGE operates by walking into government agencies and threatening to call Elon, there are some serious concerns over transparency. Who is doing what, when, why and with what authority? The solution? Repost a bunch of tweets to a website with a .gov domain name. Which, you'd think that spinning up a website that's just that would be easy. Trivially easy. \"Security issues\" shouldn't even be part of the conversation. But in actuality, the database was unsecured and anyone could modify the site. In the end, the hacked website is really just Elon Musk's \"algorithm\" improved: instead of breaking things that are already working, you just start with a broken website.

Among the parts of the process Musk deleted were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eShutting down the servers in an orderly fashion\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUsing the proper tools to uninstall the server racks\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProtecting the flooring which wasn\u0026#39;t designed to roll 2,500lb server racks\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNot wiping the hard drives which contained user data and proprietary information\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNot securing that valuable data with anything more than a set of Home Depot padlocks and Apple AirTags\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, shockingly, despite thinking this was successful in the moment, the resulting instability caused by just \u003cem\u003eripping a datacenter out\u003c/em\u003e led Musk to admit \u003ca href=\"https://futurism.com/elon-musk-moved-twitter-servers-himself\"\u003ethis was a mistake\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo let\u0026#39;s take a look at how this plays out with DOGE. One of the major efforts was taking over the Treasury Department\u0026#39;s IT systems. These are systems which handle $5 trillion in payments every year. And who do we put in change? \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-associate-bfs-federal-payment-system/\"\u003eSome random wet-behind-the-ears dev\u003c/a\u003e with a history of \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/06/nx-s1-5289337/elon-musk-doge-treasury\"\u003eracist posts on the Internet\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOstensibly, they were there to \u0026#34;audit\u0026#34; payments, so was their access read only? Did they have admin access? \u003ca href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/musk-staffer-mistakenly-ability-edit-treasury-department-payment/story?id=118726686\"\u003eWere they actually given write access\u003c/a\u003e? Could they change code? \u003cem\u003eNobody is entirely certain\u003c/em\u003e. Even if it was only read-only, there are plenty of questions about what kind of security risk that constitutes, which means \u003ca href=\"https://www.zetter-zeroday.com/court-documents-shed-new-light-on-doge-access-and-activity-at-treasury-department/\"\u003eforensic analysis to understand the breach\u003c/a\u003e, which is being called \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/largest-data-breach-in-us-history-three-more-lawsuits-try-to-stop-doge/\"\u003ethe largest data breach in history\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of the goal \u003cem\u003ewas\u003c/em\u003e to just \u003ca href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/musk-says-doge-halting-treasury-020337006.html\"\u003estop payments\u003c/a\u003e, following the Muskian \u0026#34;Break things first, and unbreak them if it was a mistake,\u0026#34; optimization strategy. Stop paying people, and if you find out you needed to pay them, \u003cem\u003ethen\u003c/em\u003e start paying them again. Step 2 of the \u0026#34;algorithm\u0026#34;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of payments, many people in the US depend on payments from the Social Security Administration. This organization, founded in 1935 as part of the New Deal, handles all sorts of benefits, including retirement benefits. According to Musk, it\u0026#39;s absolutely \u003ca href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-major-social-security-warning-fraud-billion-week-lost-2029244\"\u003eriddled with fraud\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are his arguments? Well, for starters, he worries that SSNs are \u003ca href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-major-social-security-warning-fraud-billion-week-lost-2029244\"\u003enot de-duplicated\u003c/a\u003e- that is, the same SSN could appear multiple times in the database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSocial Security Administration has, since the 1940s, been trying to argue against using SSNs as identifiers for any purpose other than Social Security. They have a \u003ca href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/ssnreportc2.html\"\u003ehistory page\u003c/a\u003e which is a delightful read as a \u0026#34;we can\u0026#39;t say the Executive Orders and laws passed which expanded the use of SSNs into domains where they shouldn\u0026#39;t have been used was a bad idea, but we can be real salty about it,\u0026#34; document. It\u0026#39;s passive-aggression perfected. But you and I already know \u003ca href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45422211/when-should-a-social-security-number-be-used-as-a-database-primary-key\"\u003eyou should never expect SSNs to be a key\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, assuming the SSA systems are mainframe systems, using flat file databases, we would expect a large degree of denormalization. Seeing \u0026#34;unique\u0026#34; keys repeated in the dataset is \u003cem\u003enormal\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the same subject, Musk has decided that \u003ca href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/musk-claims-150-year-olds-receiving-social-security-benefits\"\u003epeople over 150 years old\u003c/a\u003e are collecting Social Security benefits. Now, one could assume that this kind of erroneous data pattern is \u003cem\u003efraud\u003c/em\u003e, or we could wonder if there\u0026#39;s an underlying reason to the pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I\u0026#39;ve seen a lot of discussion on the Internet about this being an \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ISO8601/comments/1ipikj5/those_who_do_not_expect_iso8601_shall_be_punished/\"\u003eepoch related thing\u003c/a\u003e, which is certainly \u003cem\u003epossible\u003c/em\u003e, but I think the idea that it\u0026#39;s related to \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\"\u003eISO8601\u003c/a\u003e is obviously false- ISO8601 is just a string representation of dates, and also was standardized well after COBOL and well after SSA started computerizing. Because the number 150 was used, some folks have noted that would be 1875, and have suspected that \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_Convention\"\u003ethe date of the Metre Convention\u003c/a\u003e is the epoch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0026#39;t find any evidence that any of this is true, mind you, but we\u0026#39;re also reacting to a tweet by a notorious moron, and I have to wonder: did he maybe round off 5 years? Because 1870 is exactly 65 years before 1935- the year Social Security \u003cem\u003estarted\u003c/em\u003e, and 65 years is the retirement age where you can start collecting Social Security. Thus, the oldest date which the SSA would ever care about was 1870. Though, there\u0026#39;s another completely un-epoch related reason why you could have Social Security accounts well older than 150 years: \u003cem\u003eyour benefits can continue to be paid out to your spouse and dependents after your death\u003c/em\u003e. If an 80 year old marries a 20 year old, and dies the next day, that 20 year old could collect benefits on that account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key point I\u0026#39;m making is that \u0026#34;FRAUUUDDDD!!1111!!!\u0026#34; is really not the correct reaction to a system you don\u0026#39;t understand. And while there may be many better ways to handle dates within the SSA\u0026#39;s software, the system \u003cem\u003epredates computers\u003c/em\u003e and has needed to maintain its ability to pay benefits for 90 years. While you could certainly make improvements, what you can\u0026#39;t do is take a big \u0026#34;algorithm\u0026#34; Number 2 all over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich, with that in mind, the idea that these people are trying to get access to \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/16/doge-irs-access-taxpayer-data/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzM5NjgyMDAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQxMDY0Mzk5LCJpYXQiOjE3Mzk2ODIwMDAsImp0aSI6ImQyZjZkNzAxLWRlNDYtNDBkMy1hMzdlLTEzYTVkMmFiZDQwZSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDI1LzAyLzE2L2RvZ2UtaXJzLWFjY2Vzcy10YXhwYXllci1kYXRhLyJ9.GTR7Kzo7RHkVEfAw9fm8z_ME0V59fiFRofc8rtH9dG8\"\u003ea whole slew of confidential taxpayer information\u003c/a\u003e is I\u0026#39;m sure going to go *great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are so, \u003cem\u003eso\u003c/em\u003e many more things that could be discussed here, but let\u0026#39;s close with the DOGE website. Given that DOGE operates by walking into government agencies and \u003ca href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/musk-trump-doge-threats-nerd-army-1235267839/\"\u003ethreatening to call Elon\u003c/a\u003e, there are some serious concerns over \u003cem\u003etransparency\u003c/em\u003e.

Trivially easy. \u0026#34;Security issues\u0026#34; shouldn\u0026#39;t even be part of the conversation.
