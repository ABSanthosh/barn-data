  "description": "Some people prefer the big city life to small town living, and that's fine. The accessibility to public transportation, the people watching, the endless things to do, etc. It's a faster pace of life and some people thrive in that environment. However, some people are the complete opposite and thrive in places that are slower. That is when small town/country life is embraced! People who are like this go out to find a secluded plot of land for themselves where they can live in peace and solitude and only see people when they so choose to. In the city, the second you step outside of your door, you are likely to encounter another person. In the country, you're more likely to encounter a woodland creature before anyone else—and that's how they like it! Both have their negatives and positives.  However, if you are a visitor in either of those places, you know to respect the rules of the area. That means, reading the signs that tell you what you can or cannot do around town. Like, perhaps, \"private property\" and \"do not enter\" signs. They have those everywhere, it's not like you don't understand what they mean…",
