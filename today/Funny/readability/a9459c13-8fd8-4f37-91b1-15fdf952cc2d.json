  "description": "Ah, the mystery that is a kitten. You never know, when a cat is still that small, exactly what they are going to turn into. And although most times, they just turn into regular ol' cats, that's not always the case. Sometimes, a kitten that is born tiny never grows bigger, and you find out that your kitty has drawfism and will stay small forever. Other times, the normal kitten you adopted doesn't stop growing, and you realize that you adopted a Maine Coon cat or a Norwegian Forest cat. And sometimes, like this time probably, the kitten you adopted grows and grows and grows, and all you are left with is… a regular cat that is just a little bigger than most. Not a Maine Coon, not a unique cat in any way. Just a big cat. And a big cat like this one is not something to be concerned about. It's something to celebrate, because although it means that the shenanigans will be twice as big, it also means that you will have twice as much cat to cuddle.",

But, in our very unpurrfessional opinion… some cats are just big. And that is something pawsome. The bigger the cat, the more cat there is to cuddle with.  That pretty much sums it up for us. But you know what? The owner being worried is not a bad thing. It shows that they care. It shows that they are going to take care of this kitty properly his whole life.
