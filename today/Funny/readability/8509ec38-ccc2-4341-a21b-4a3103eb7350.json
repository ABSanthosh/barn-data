Thanks to their scholarship, we all may soon be able to roll our kaleidoscopic vehicles over the rainbow road straight to the glitter-covered surface of Saturn, and we’ll have these two and their message of radical love to thank when we do.” At press time, Zoomer and Zorbit had dedicated their award to their dear friend and collaborator, a purple leopard-print seal.
