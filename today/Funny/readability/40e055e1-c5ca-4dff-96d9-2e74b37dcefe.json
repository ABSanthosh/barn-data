  "description": "This startup really regretted firing a secret all-star employee, ultimately losing 3 of their biggest clients as a result of corpo selfishness. All-star employees rarely get commendations for their hard work. Good workers don't necessarily need a gold star at the end of each workday to prove that they did an exemplary job, but it's certainly nice to get a pat on the back from your superiors when you're the only employee holding up each pillar of your boss's startup. The hardworking employee in this next tale learned that 'wearing multiple hats' in a startup environment ultimately left them with a target on their back after a newbie manager got jealous of the boss using their slides to present projects to the clients. Keep scrolling to read all the details of this story of workplace arrogance where a manager got so greedy about their own pats on the back that they fired the one employee who actually knew how to handle their biggest, most important clients. The result? A multitude of deleted files beyond recovery that left the C-level bosses in a lurch. How do you attach a PDF to an email again?",
