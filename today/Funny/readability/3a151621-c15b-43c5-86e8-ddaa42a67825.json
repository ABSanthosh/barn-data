  "description": "Restaurant work, specifically, roles that exist in the kitchen, must live up to certain expectations, health codes, and standards set by the state. Without these rules and regulations, the food these restaurants serve and the safety of the kitchen staff would be put at risk. Luckily, most of those in managerial positions ensure that these rules are followed to a tee—but not all. Others believe that the regulations don't apply to them, that they are above the dangers of flames, sharp knives, and heavy cast-iron pans. When that happens, it's up to those around them to put them in check. If that fails, you go above them. The employee in this story does exactly that, but is ostracized as a result.This story proves that no matter how high a position one might be in, they prove that they don't deserve to have that power and sway.
