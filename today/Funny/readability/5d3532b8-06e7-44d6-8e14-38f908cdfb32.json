  "description": "We like trains here at Error'd, and you all seem to like trains too. That must be the main reason we get so many submissions about broken information systems. \"Pass,\" said Jozsef . I think that train might have crashed already.   An anonymous subscriber shared an epic tale some time ago. They explained thus. \"(I couldn't capture in the photo, but the next station after Duivendrecht was showing the time of 09:24+1.) We know Europe has pretty good trains, and even some high-speed lines. But this was the first time I boarded a time-traveling train. At first I was annoyed to be 47 minutes late. I thought I could easily walk from Amsterdam Centraal to Muiderpoort in less than the 53 minutes that this train would take. But I was relieved to know the trip to the further stations was going to be quicker, and I would arrive there even before arriving at the earlier stations.\" I think the explanation here is that this train is currently expected to arrive at Muiderport around 10:01. But it's still projected to arrive at the following stop at 9:46, and more surprisingly at the successive stops at 9:35 and 9:25.   Railfan Richard B. recently shared \"Points failure on the West Coast Main Line has disrupted the linear nature of time.\"   and quite some time ago, he also sent us this snap, singing \"That train that's bound for glory? It runs through here.\"   An unrelated David B. wonders \"When is the next train? We don't know, it's running incognito.\"   And finally, courageous Ivan got sideways underground. \"Copenhagen subway system may have fully automated trains, but their informational screens need a little manual help every now and then.\"   [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.
