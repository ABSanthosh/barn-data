  "description": "We all love a good cat adoption story. It's the most heartwarming type of story there is. At least, we think so - but it's not a secret we're all serious crazy cat ladies here. But we can safely assume you are well, or that you're at least a general feline fanatic fan yourself. And you're probably a cat pawrent, too (and if you're not - take this as a sign to go and adopt a fluffy feline friend, and make your own wholesome adoption story about it). So you understand us when we say that cat adoption stories are our favorite stories.But we never could've imagined that the cat adoption story that will melt our hearts this week will be… a cat's adoption story. Yeah, a cat adopting a kitten. It's the cat's story, and the cat adopts a kitten. How absolutely adorable. We need to wipe our hearts from the floor, because they've all melted. Not just because it's an adopted cat that's adopting a kitten - but because the entire online feline family came forward with similar stories. So we actually got a bunch of stories about cats adopting kittens, and we can basically call it for this week. We're done. This is too cute to continue.You know what? We feel inspired. After this week is over, we're all going to the shelter to have our adorable I Can Has Cheezburger office cats adopt them a new kitten sibling. It's a win-win situation for everyone - a kitten looking for a home will get adopted, our cats will have a new smol member in their pack, and we will have another cat. Seriously, there's no more wholesome than that.",

The amount of “Aww”s that came out of people's mouths was abundant. It's one of the cutest things ever. These are really sound pieces of advice. Not everything is magic for every cat introduction, but in general lines - these are great. This person knows what they're talking about. It's so nice to have people in the online feline family so ready to help, and share from their knowledge, to pass it on to people who need some cat advice.",
