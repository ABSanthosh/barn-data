  "description": "This cat lover might've stepped on a few tails. After noticing a frail, vision-impaired kitty constantly hanging around her yard, she assumed the sweet old fluff was a stray. Turns out, the cat belonged to her neighbor, who owns a whopping nine free-roaming felines. Concerned for the senior cat's health, this kind-hearted pawrent offered food, pets, and even shelter during a thunderstorm, letting her rest in the catio with the door open for a stress-free escape.When the neighbor came knocking (loudly) the next morning, fur flew. Despite the cat heading home on her own hours earlier, the neighbor accused her of stealing her cat, hurled insults, and warned her never to interact with her cats again. To make things messier, she then spread rumors around the neighborhood, painting this rescuer as a catnapper.Now, the pawrent feels bad for bonding with the blind kitty, but when a vulnerable cat chooses you for comfort and care, how can you not lend a paw? Maybe it ruffled some feathers, but kindness shouldn't come with claws attached.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",
