  "description": "If you knew that your electric breaker was supplying power to another house's appliances and mechanisms, how would you feel? Would you be suspicious that your neighbor knew this was the deal all along, or would you brush it off and try to figure out steps forward so you can avoid this ever happening again? Well, ideally, you'll stop paying for other people's electricity without burning bridges. Sometimes, though, circumstances prevent you from being the bigger person. The homeowner in this next story explains that his neighbor's landlord is making it really hard to recircuit the wiring so everybody's happy.This homeowner realized at some point over a year ago that their electricity was being used by someone other than them. We linked that article right there for you when the narrator references it. Now, nothing has changed, thanks to the same neighbor's landlord.

Well, it's become a money issue for this homeowner, too, not to mention a major safety hazard due to how the wiring is currently done. Scroll below to read the full story.",
