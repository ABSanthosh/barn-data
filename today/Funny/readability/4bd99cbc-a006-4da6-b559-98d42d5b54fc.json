  "description": "We like to think that we were a pretty savvy teen, feline fam. It may have been over 20 years ago, but we were quite productive during our high school years. We studied hard to get into a good college, were the captain of our sports team, and pawticipated in many extra-curricular activities. But none of that, and we really mean none, could compare to what Robin Lee Graham did when he was a teenager. At the young age of 16 years old, he decided to set sail across the world, traveling over 33,000 nautical miles with no help except for the companionship of his cute sailor cats he brought with him.He faced many hardships along the way, including losing his mast shortly after departing, and even having to change boats midway due to extensive damage to his ship. He said, however, that the cats helped him deal with loneliness and feel comforted. So this proves it once and for all that cats are the best companions to have, right?
