  "description": "Oh, Ceiling Cat, please grant us the strength to not strangle our boss if they come to us with one more stupid question. Our patience goes down rapidly as we progress through the week, and by the time we get to Furiday, we could even give Grumpy Cat a run for her money. Since we need our job and we have bills to pay, we must find a way to let out our feisty feline energy without actually doing anything about it. This is where we come in! We've got some memes of feisty felines being the ultimate jerks to help you avoid doing anything rash while at work. Deep, calming breaths.Live vicariously through these silly cattos doing what cats do best: being jerks whenever they feel like it. This, among many things, is one of the reasons why we wish we were a cat. Oh well. Life isn't fair, is it? At least we have feline funnies to help us release our inner cat. Without them, we would be without a job…literally!",
