  "description": "We don't know how it's possible, but some people still actually believe that cats don't care about their humans - that they only tolerate us because we feed them. These people must have never had cats in their lives. Because cats care about their humans so, so much. That is something undeniable that you learn incredibly fast as a cat owner. And sure, some cats have funny ways of showing affection, but that doesn't make their affection any less real. It just means that you have to pay attention to their love languages a little more closely. And all cats have one thing in common - cats will be there for you when you need them the most. They can tell when something is wrong with you. They know when you actually need their help - emotional, or like the cat today - physical. The cat in this story knew that something was wrong with one of his humans, and whether he knew what he was doing or not, keeping this woman conscious until the EMTs arrived to help her most likely has saved her life.",
