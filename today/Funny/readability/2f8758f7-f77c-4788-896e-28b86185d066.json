  "description": "Another week has passed, and thank goodness for that. The week was crazy, Caturday was pawsome, but Sunday… Sunday is for relaxing. Sunday is not for dramatic threads and gut-wrenching stories. No, Sunday is all about pawsitivity and wholesome cat memes. What we want to spend all day doing is relaxing and enjoying cats - whether it's cuddling with our real cat and awwing and heartwarming cat memes.Really, let's be honest, starting any day with pawsitive cat memes would be good for our soul. It would help us start our days on the right paw with the right cattitude. But on Sunday, it's extra impawtant. Because that way, we could be collecting all the good vibes that we need for next week. And boy, do we need some good vibes. With all the craziness going on in the world, the more wholesomeness we get into our system, the better, and everyone knows that there is nothing more heartwarming and pure than a bunch of cats being their itty bitty cute selves.",

Zoom calls are one of the most dreaded things for any employee and any student because there are simply too many distractions around, and staying focused is nearly impawssible. You know what would keep us focused on the call though? Cats. It's the thought that counts. And the execution. And he has done both purrfectly. He does not go outside to hunt, but the instincts are still there, and clearly, he chose an enemy that he thought was worthy of its time. And he's winning every single battle it seems.",
