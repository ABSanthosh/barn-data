  "description": "Some people say home is where the heart is, but for one group of renters, home was wherever their entitled landlady could invade their privacy and ration out basic freedoms like they were living in a benevolent dictatorship. Imagine seven adults paying real money to share bathrooms, having zero kitchen rights, and watching their own food get stolen and served at someone else's table. The landlady in this saga treated \"my house, my rules\" less like a phrase and more like a constitutional amendment. Bringing your own appliances was banned, the fridge was her private domain, and anyone with a food allergy might as well call urgent care on move-in day. Boundaries were a suggestion at best. Locked doors or personal belongings were fair game for spontaneous \"cleaning sessions,\" and tenants learned the hard way that mentioning privacy was an invitation for gossip storms and passive-aggressive lectures. If someone tried to set up a logical laundry schedule, it became her cue to run the washing machine around the clock and then blame every repair bill on the roommates.  Long-term tenants were treated like squatters compared to the royal welcome extended to nightly Airbnb guests, who always got first dibs on the \"good bathroom.\"",
