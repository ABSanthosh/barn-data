  "description": "Oh, Wednesdays. How you love to play with us. On one hand, when we reach you, we know that the week is halfway over. On the other hand, we know that we still have half of the week left. Not like it really matters to us, we checked out on Tuesday. Sure, we're here in the office, but mentally, we're at home cuddling with our cute cats and binging our current obsession on Netflix (we only have one episode left of Squid Games). That's why we're scrolling through some furbulously funny cat memes instead of actually working (even though our job is to scroll through memesâ€¦.you get what we're saying).These memes are for all you overworked \u0026 underpaid employees who mentally clocked out in 2012. If you like to spend your hours in your cubicle watching random Youtube videos while sending the occasional email, you're going to love these fluffy felines in meme form. You don't even have to like cats to laugh at them, but who doesn't like cats nowadays? Anyway, you can scroll down to the memes now. Or not, it's your choice.",
