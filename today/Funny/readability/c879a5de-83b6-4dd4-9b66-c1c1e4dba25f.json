  "description": "People do the wildest things on their work video calls… and sometimes they don't even realize it until their coworkers are giggling at their expense. I'm a huge fan of people who show their pets during Zoom video calls. First of all, if you work from home, Fluffy is your coworker now, so get him on the call, pronto! Second of all, your pet is never a bother. Cats love to jump up on the desk and start rubbing themselves on your face at the exact moment you're trying to give an important presentation to your boss (it's like they know that they're choosing the worst possible time to do it!). Don't be embarrassed that Mr. Whiskers is getting in the frame, just embrace it! Now, your precious pet can mug for the camera while you deliver last quarter's numbers. You've instantly livened up the meeting! Congrats! However, that's not the only way you can liven up your coworker's video call experience and become the workplace personality hire. Just keep reading, and you'll find a bunch of stories about hilarity on video calls, for better or worse. Up next, read about the inexperienced traveling YouTuber parents who plan to sell their home, travel full time, and make $50k, in that order: \"",
