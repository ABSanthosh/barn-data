  "description": "Gifts should not come at a price like this one. After all, the gift of a vacation is not the opportunity for a business venture.Â Clearly, this one family thought differently when they invited their kid's friend to a trip to Costa Rica and subsequently charged the friend's parents for a significant portion of the trip without warning after the fact. Perhaps if the other kid's parents knew that this was always going to be the plan before the vacation, they wouldn't have allowed their daughter to go to Costa Rica. Let this story serve as a friendly reminder that transparency across all parties is key, people!Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.",

  "text": "This teenager was invited by a friend in her class to join her family for a vacation to Costa Rica. Her parents allowed this and expected to offer the friend's family payment for some of the expenses during the trip. However, the communication was never set in stone. Following the vacation, the teenager's parents were unexpectedly billed for far more than they had anticipated. Several members of the community weighed in on this subject with their hot takes. Some folks felt that the parents should have communicated with the family of their daughter's friend to sort things out prior to the trip and are, at the very least, partially to blame for what went down. However, the vast majority of people seem to feel that the other family is largely in the wrong here and that the swift transactional nature of their invitation comes across as a bit tacky.",
