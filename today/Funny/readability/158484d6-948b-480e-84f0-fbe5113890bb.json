  "description": "Growing up, there are things about adulthood that feel like they're going to be much bigger threats than they are. Quicksand, for starters. There's a lot less quicksand in adult life than cartoons made it out to be. One of the things they warn you about that is really terrifying? In-laws. That's right, there's nothing scarier than meeting the people who made your partner and seeing them in their natural habitat only for you to realize, \"Oh, that explains everything.\" It's worse when your partner doesn't even realize the quirks they were endowed with are full-fledged nightmares when displayed by their parents. Some people really luck out with their in-laws, don't get me wrong. A vision of shared holidays, parents splitting time amicably when helping out with childcare. But not all of us can live a fairy tale. And if we do, it might be a Grimm one.OP here is at her wits end with her in-laws. After years of accepting their beratement and frankly bad behavior, she turns to Reddit to help her decide if she's had enough. Does her boyfriend have what it takes to acknowledge his family's shortcomings? Or will he continue the generational curse yet again?",
