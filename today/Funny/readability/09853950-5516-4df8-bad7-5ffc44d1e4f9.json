  "description": "Let's be real; everything is a subscription these days, whether or not they should be or even really can be. Before long, we'll need to keep up with the weekly subscription on our toaster for the privilege of cooking two pieces of toast at once. While that might sound outrageous, keep in mind printers have already normalized that type of thing for years—even new cars have started coming with basic features locked behind subscription-based grifting models. While this is bad, it's even worse when you sign up to try something, and then when you try to cancel, you come to find that it's unbelievably difficult to do so. Whereas it was easy to sign up (usually under a \"free\" trial), the button to cancel before the annual fee is charged will be concealed within the most remote regions of the app or website.That's what happened in this story, where the author shared a second-hand account of how a friend of theirs got back at a major dating app over a simple refusal of a $45 refund request.",
