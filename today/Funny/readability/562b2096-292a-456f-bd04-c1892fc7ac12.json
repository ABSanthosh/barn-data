  "description": "It's one of those weeks… But honestly, it's always one of those weeks, isn't it? The mid-week work blues happen to anyone, and if you say otherwise, then you're lying to yourself. You can be the CEO of a successful company where all you're paid to do is sit at a desk and pretend to work, and you would still hate the middle of the week. The sound of the word \"Wednesday\" makes me wince. As you can see, I feel very strongly about the middle of the workweek. What's worse is that the weekend lasts for 0.5 seconds before we're back to the beginning of the workweek again. The cycle never ends, the grind never stops. At least we have memes to laugh through the pain!If you're feeling woeful on this wonderful Wednesday, then consider scrolling below. You might crack a smile for the first time today! Hey—I won't tell anyone.",
