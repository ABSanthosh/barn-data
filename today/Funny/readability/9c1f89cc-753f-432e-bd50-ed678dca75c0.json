  "description": "There's nothing worse than watching your boss blatantly play favorites. You put in the hours, stay late, and volunteer for extra work, only to see someone else (usually less deserving) get all the praise and opportunities. It's not just unfair; it's extremely infuriating. I once worked for a manager who practically rolled out the red carpet for her so-called golden employees. They got the big, exciting projects while the rest of us were stuck handling the grunt work. One time, I pitched an idea I was really proud of, only to have it ignored. A week later, one of her favorites pitched pretty much the same exact thing, and suddenly, it was brilliant. If you've ever felt that kind of frustration, you're going to love this story. Let's just say the boss who played favorites didn't exactly come out on top. Sometimes, karma works overtime, and boy is it satisfying.",
