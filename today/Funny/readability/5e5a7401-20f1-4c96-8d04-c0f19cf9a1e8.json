  "description": "Work holiday parties are a delicate concoction of forced holiday cheer and awkward social experiments. Case in point: the infamous White Elephant gift exchange. For those who've never played, it's a game where everyone brings a wrapped present, and the fun begins as gifts are opened, stolen, and swapped in a battle for glory—or, at least, the coolest gift under $20. Sure, seeing who ends up with what is fun (bonus points if you get to steal from the office food thief), but let's not sugarcoat it. Actually buying your gift to contribute is brutal. You're left agonizing over whether your limited budget should go toward something clever, something useful, or something just plain ridiculous. But will your coworkers think your gift is funny or just straight-up lame? Maybe we should just take a sick day instead.This office's gift exchange was gearing up to be a competitive one when a surprise guest—a 10-year-old kid—decided to join the game. Things got a little awkward with the employee's kid involved when the Original Poster (OP) walked away after stealing her coveted dragon gift. Cue a split office and a moral dilemma. But the OP was technically just following the rules. Were they in the wrong?",
