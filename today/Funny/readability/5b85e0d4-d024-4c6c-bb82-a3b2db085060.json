  "description": "It's hard to apply for a job when you already feel more qualified than the person who wrote the posting in the first place. It's one of the ultimate dualities of the job search process. Sometimes, the gatekeepers you're trying to impress have a fraction of your own intelligence. Unfortunately, that's the way the cookie crumbles, and if you need the job, you have no choice but to pretend that you didn't catch your future employer spell \"punctual\" like \"ponctual.\" Keep scrolling below for this amusing collection of poorly written job postings. Whoever wrote these should consider using spell check like the rest of us!",
