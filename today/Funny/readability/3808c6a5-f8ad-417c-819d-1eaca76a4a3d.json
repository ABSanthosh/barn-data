  "description": "Good meowrning! Yes, we know it's a Monday morning, but we're still very happy. It's not a secret why - we're surrounded by cats. We have our meowgnificent office cats that keep us company while we work:First, we have the meowjestic queen of the house, named Queeny after her queenliness. She's so floofy and regal, and if she stops by your office chair and stares at you - you have to stop whatever you're doing and pet her soft white fur. Then, we have Krampus. He's a ginger berserker cat with no brain cells whatsoever between his two big ears. When he's calm, he'll stare at blank walls. But when he's not, he runs around like a zoomies demon. And lastly, we have the cutie patootie kitten Mitten. He's still so smol we don't know what he'll be like when he grows up, but we all love him so much.But assuming you don't have cats running around your workplace, but you still want to have this feline feel-good feeling on a Monday morning - what can you do? Well, that's not complicated - all there is to do is look at some feel-good feline funnies. Your Monday is bound to be better.",
