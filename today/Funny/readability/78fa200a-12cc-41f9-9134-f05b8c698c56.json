  "description": "Hey there, feline fam. We don't know about you, but our cats make every day feel like Christmas (without all of the knocking down of ornaments). Every day with them is a gift of purrfect silliness, memeable meowments, and pawsitively snuggly evenings. That's one of the great things about cats: they make our lives better just by being themselves. This is the exact reason why we can scroll through cat content for hours and hours on end! Because everyone's cat is unique and awwdorable, and we love seeing the lives of other people's fur babies.When you search for \"silly cat pictures\" on the interwebz, you can come up with enough content to keep you glued to the screen for days, nay, weeks, nay, years! But that's too much, so we made your job easier and found some of the most hissterical cat pictures from the lives of pawsitively pawdorable fur babies to deck your Wednesday with lols aplenty. Santa came to town early this year and delivered us these beautiful, derpy cats that just can't help but make you smile. (We're Santa in this analogy, in case you didn't get it). Merry two weeks until Christmas!",
