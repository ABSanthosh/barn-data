Damage one little corner of a 15-year-old carpet or a horrifically sun-faded curtain, and suddenly, they're quoting you for full replacement and the consequential loss involved with that replacement—purely as a means to keeping your entire deposit, money that they feel entitled to.Meanwhile, your time and your things are valueless to them and they will be slothful about anything that needs repairing. Plus, should they accidentally damage your things while on-site, they'll dismiss complaints with a wave of their handReally, in any situation, it's not ok to push something to your complete and absolute advantage, but especially when you're in a position of power. The reality is when it comes to renting and landlord, there's a distinct power imbalance; even excluding everything else involved in the arrangement, housing is a finite resource, and in many areas, it's becoming increasingly difficult to secure someplace to live. Landlords in these areas, knowing this, will milk tenants for all they're worth. This is particularly bad in areas surrounding universities, lower-income areas, or anywhere else where landlords know that relative inexperience or ability to fight back falls directly into their favor.These tenants got back at their cheap landlord by ensuring that he didn't see a dime from his endeavors to overcharge them for petty damage to items at the house where they were living.",
