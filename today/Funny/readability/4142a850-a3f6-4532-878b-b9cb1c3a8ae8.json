  "text": "Mission: Impossible—The Final Reckoning, the eighth installment in the series, is expected to be another box-office smash. The Onion shares everything you need to know about the film.  Q: Who is directing? A: Christopher McQuarrie with a gun pointed at his head by Tom Cruise. Q: What stunts does Tom Cruise pull off in this one? A: He manages to deliver several monologues about a computer villain called “the Entity” while maintaining a straight face. Q: Isn’t Tom Cruise a Scientologist? A: No. He’s Impossible Missions Force agent Ethan Hunt. Q: Who is the movie for? A. The Final Reckoning is great for everyone, whether you’re a male age 18 to 24 or a male age 25 to 40. Q: What’s the mission this time? A: To make $800 million at the box office. Q: Why did the film have such a high budget? A: McQuarrie insisted on using real innocent victims for each explosion. Q: Is Clark Gable in it? A: No, Clark Gable unfortunately continues to be dead.  Q: What new vehicle have they decided to stage an elaborate chase sequence with? A: Let’s just say that if fans aren’t ready for a recumbent bicycle, then they better get ready.  Q: Should I ask Sara if she wants to go see it with me? A: Yes. She might say no, but the pain of rejection will be nothing compared to the pain of not knowing. Q: Is this the last Mission: Impossible film? A: It’s the last one with non-CGI Tom Cruise. Q: What’s Tom Cruise’s next project? A: Based on probability, dying in a helicopter crash.",
