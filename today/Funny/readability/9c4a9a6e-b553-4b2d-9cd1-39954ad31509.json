  "description": "Every cat owner knows that one of the main advantages of having cats over dogs is that they are self-sufficient. You can stay stress-free while spending 8+ hours at work while your fluffy felines nap at home, and then enjoy their screams for food as you walk in the door. You can even go away for a weekend every once in a while with just someone to check in on them and make sure they have enough food and water. Dogs, however, need walks in the middle of the day and are not the best at staying home alone. That doesn't mean that you can go away for multiple days at a time, constantly, and expect them to be okay. No house cat is that self-sufficient. That's why the flatmate in the story below is deciding to confront her roommate about being a bad pawrent - she leaves her cat alone for multiple days at a time, constantly, and just recently was gone for 9 days. Do you think she should say something? Read through all the details below.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",
