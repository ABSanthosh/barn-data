I wasn't aware that they were fighting each other with these songs; or singing the songs of other birds wrong to flex on them, claiming hexes. I sort of just thought they were saying \"I'm a bird\" over and over, and in some ways that's true, but they're putting a little English on it. I used to use Merlin Bird ID to summon birds as though by magic, but then I read that it might not be cool? I didn't know it was bad to use Merlin in this way; I thought it was like a really good bird call. And it only worked one time, they don't give a shit anymore. Even the first time he gave me the side-eye, but that might simply have been a function of avian vision. I could feel it, though; I did not require a powerful software model to know him. It was unambiguous: \"where's ur beak at bro.\" (CW)TB out.",
