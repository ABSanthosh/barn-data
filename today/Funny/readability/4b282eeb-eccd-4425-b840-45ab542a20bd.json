  "description": "Maine Coons. We have all seen them, we all love them, but do we really know them? Sure, we know that fully-grown Maine Coons are majestic and beautiful and regal, and we know that itty bitty Maine Coon kittens are too fluffy for their own good and have yet to grow into their ears. We know that, and every post and story about Maine Coons that we see makes us happy, makes us aww. But we have never had Maine Coons ourselves, and we don't think that we have ever seen the process - from itty bitty to mighty fluffy. Apparently, we have been missing out a lot. Who knew that there ameowzing and meowgical Maine Coons have an awkward phase as teenagers? We didn't, but now that we know, we feel like this information was crucial to our lives. We don't know how we would have continued to live had we continued not knowing this. Right now, everything seems a little bit brighter. And our desire to adopt a Maine Coon has risen by about… one million.",

They seem just like any other normal kitten, and then, they grow into the most majestic, regal, sometimes clumsy as heck creatures.  This kitty really doesn't even look like the same animal as the one in the first picture anymore. The face, the size, the look in its eyes - they're all different. Now, he knows. He knows the powers that he has, that's why the look in his eyes has changed. And he will not have any problem using these powers.",
