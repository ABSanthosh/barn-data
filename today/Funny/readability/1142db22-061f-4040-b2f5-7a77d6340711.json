  "description": "Getting ghosted by an employer is the worst way to get 'fired,' but this ex-employee at the mall's ice rink wasn't about to let a managerial ghosting cut off his food supply. When you're fired, you have closure. Like a breakup, closure is critical to move on in your life, both emotionally and mentally. So if you're still under the impression that you're employed by a company, how are you supposed to print out your resume and campus the rest of the town for a new job? Managers utilize this tactic to keep good employees on the hook, absolving themselves of unemployment fees and saving themselves from the discomfort of actually firing someone. Alas, this college kid was too hungry to let the absence of a paycheck deter him from going to work, pillaging the break room fridge, and making management sorry they ever quiet-fired him.",
