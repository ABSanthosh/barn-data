  "description": "Living with other adults is difficult, especially since there will inevitably be shared household costs. Especially when you're living with others in your early 20s, it's highly likely that you're going to end up with a roommate who has yet to learn how to function as an adult. Heck, even when you get a little bit older, you quickly become accustomed to the fact that some people just aren't ever going to figure it out.People have different ways of living and different ideas about what is and isn't appropriate. Not to mention, when it comes to things like the temperature of the home and the costs associated with it, people naturally have different ideas about what is \"comfortable\" or \"tolerable.\" And as someone who runs perpetually hot and enjoys the crisp feeling of cold air, especially when it's snowy out, I have to stick up for this roommate at least a little bit and say that perhaps their other roommates are simply lizard people who like it to be WAY too hot inside… if the heat was on full-blast I'd want to have a window open too. Still, everything else about their apparent attitude makes it hard to support them in this disagreement. That being said, it sounds like this is an unpleasant living situation all around, and even the woman who shared this story probably isn't walking away completely clean.",
