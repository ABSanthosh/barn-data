  "description": "You don't always need to be paid back for everything in life: sometimes, you can just let something go for the good of your relationship. I think many friendships operate this way. You buy your friends some drinks one night, then they pay for the Uber ride home. Or you offer to pay for dinner, and the next time, they treat you to a home-cooked meal. If you're constantly bugging people for money that they owe you, especially if it's small amounts you're being stingy over, it may leave a bad taste in some people's mouths. When you Venmo request someone send you $3 for their portion of a meal tip, it makes you wonder if they're currently low on cash, or if they're just always side-eyeing you, calculating how much you owe them. On the other hand, if you share an expensive food with someone, like a cake that costs roughly $90, maybe you should be charging them by the slice. That's a costly dish! No doubt this 17-year-old would've chosen something else to snack on if she knew just how much it would cost her. And as her mom shared, it's also causing some issues in the family. Next, read about this CFO who got his expensive Corvette towed in a case of \"parking justice.\"",
