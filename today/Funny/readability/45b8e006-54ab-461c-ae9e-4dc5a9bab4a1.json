  "description": "Parenthood is not easy. We all know that, and cats know it too. Kittens, as independent as they like to pretend they are, have a lot to learn in those beginning stages of life. Kittens have to learn how to drink water without it getting all up in their noses. Kittens have to learn how to communicate effectively, so that they will know exactly how to demand everything that they need from their humans. Kittens need to learn the basics from their parents, so it's no surprise that cat parenthood can be overwhelming to some. And let's not forget just how hyperactive and wiggly and squeaky kittens are in the beginning. You pick them up and they wiggle-jiggle right out of your hand. The chaos starts young with these guys. We know it, but this Maine Coon cat dad… seems to not have gotten the warning. Yeah, you would think that the first meeting between a cat dad and his babies would be wholesome… and it is. It's just hilarious at the same time.",
