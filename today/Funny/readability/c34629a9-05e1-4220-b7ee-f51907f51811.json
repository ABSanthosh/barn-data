  "description": "One manager is finding out the hard way that they were too hasty in firing a few of their teenage employees. As a manager, you have leeway to make some important decisions. A supervisor needs to decide if they'll pull in more employees to make a shift easier, or send a few home so that the business saves money. You might get handed responsibilities like counting drawers at the end of the day or supervising closing and opening shifts. However, the manager at this store just randomly took it upon themself to fire a couple of young workers… and the head boss was not pleased with that choice at all! Firing employees isn't something every manager can just decide to do. Just because a supervisor is having a bad day or decides they want to get rid of a certain employee, doesn't mean they're allowed to on any level. So when this person went to r/AmItheA****** to ask for advice about what they did, the internet swiftly told them how stupid their choice was, and pretty unanimously informed them that they were wrong. Next, check out some terrible birthday presents that people shared that made them shake their heads, like one person who \"got a check… for $5. It bounced and cost me $10.\"",
