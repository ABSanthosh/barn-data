  "description": "Realistically, when a CEO hires employees to do a job, they hire them to take care of business they cannot take care of themselves. Whether it is because they don't have the time, or maybe they don't have the skill, either way–everyone is there for a reason. That is how you build a company, by assembling a group of people who can help the business take off, and do what needs to be done.However, since we are still talking about the CEO, they still get to treat the company like their own, and justifyingly so. They can make demands, change elements of the work, and ask employees anything, and they would not be denied. They owe everything there after all, why would they be denied?Well, the answer is that even though they run the business, that doesn't mean they understand everything about it. Again, they have employees for a reason. Employees who master and understand their field, and they do not need the CEO, or anyone else related to the CEO for that matter, to get involved.",
