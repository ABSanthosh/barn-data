  "description": "When one works a job that requires a daily quota, the best way to manage that is by never going under that quota, but never going over it either.Not going under the daily quota is self-explanatory. If you are hired to do a certain amount of work, doing anything less than that might suggest you are not the right person for the job. However, going over the daily quota is something that some employees see as a positive. By doing more than you're actually required to do, you are proving that you are a hardworking and trustworthy employee willing to go above and beyond for the sake of the company. What is wrong with that?Well, the moment you prove to your employer that you can do more than is required, they might start getting used to this new output of work. Which means that if you ever find yourself doing anything less, management is not going to be happy about it.You shouldn't do anything more than what is expected of you, but if you are still unsure, maybe the story below will tip you over.",
