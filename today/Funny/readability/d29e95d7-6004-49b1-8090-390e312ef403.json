  "text": "Hank doesn’t seem too bothered by the propaganda Hulu recently shared the first clip of the upcoming King of the Hill reboot. But it doesn’t take place in Hank and Peggy’s house. Or at Strickland propane. Or even in the Chuck Mangione-infested Mega Lo Mart.Nope, the scene is set entirely inside the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, where Hank drools over the former commander-in-chief’s possessions, including a World Series ball and presidential pen. But there’s a big issue with this – even apart from the fact that Hank’s opinion of Bush soured 25 years ago when he received a “limp” handshake from the presidential candidate.  While the locale is presented as lame and boring in the King of the Hill clip, in real life, the Bush museum is deeply messed up. The “$250 million complex” features numerous eyebrow-raising exhibits that are arguably a concerted effort to sanitize the president’s horrific legacy. For example, there’s “Decision Points Theater,” in which visitors are invited to re-enact key moments from the Bush presidency and vote on whichever course of action they think would be best. Presumably, the original name for the attraction was “If You’re So Smart, Why Don’t You Try Being President.” Don't Miss Guests can try their hand at tackling crises such as the threat of Saddam Hussein, Hurricane Katrina and the Financial Crisis. But if you deviate from Bush’s path, he shows up in a video and tells you why he was right, actually. According to VICE, when participants dealt with Saddam by seeking a “new U.N. resolution,” which Bush didn’t, a recording of the ex-President basically scolded them. “Before 9/11, Saddam was a problem America might have been able to solve,” Bush stated. “But after 9/11, the world was made safer by his removal.” And that’s not the only instance in which the museum retroactively justifies the invasion of Iraq, which was deemed to be illegal by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and led to the deaths of 200,000 Iraqi civilians. A display about the Iraq War boasts that while “no stockpiles of W.M.D. were found, post-invasion inspections confirmed that Saddam Hussein had the capacity to resume production of W.M.D.”  And in another video former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice defends the Bush administration’s use of torture by stating, “If you were in a position of authority on September 11th, every day after was September 12th.” There’s also a replica of the White House Situation Room where, at one point, the museum planned to have kids roleplay events such as “September 11th and the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan.” Fun for the whole family! And of course, no museum would be complete without a gift shop. The George W. Bush-themed shop hawks baseballs, playing cards and whiskey glasses — the latter seems like an odd souvenir to get at a museum dedicated to a guy who famously had a severe drinking problem and was once arrested for driving under the influence.We’ll have to wait until August to see if Hank ends up LARPing the Iraq War while he’s there.  Tags: News Scroll down for the next article Must Read SIGN UP FORA WEEKLYNEWSLETTER OF JOKES + TRIVIA",
