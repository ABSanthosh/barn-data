  "description": "Happy Tuesday, feline friends and fam. We here at I Can Has Cheezburger know that the current state of the world just makes it harder and harder to get by. If we could, we would move into the forest and surround ourselves with only our fluffy feline friends, we would. However, we have less than zero survival skills and our cats wouldn't survive without their Fancy Feast, so we're stuck here in this endless cycle of working, eating, sleeping, relying on our cute cats for happiness, and doing it all over again. Luckily, we have a few tricks up our sleeves to keep our pawsitivity up, no matter what life may throw at us. One of those tricks is making sure we have access to a soft, purring cat as often as pawssible, and the second is to scroll through as many silly cat memes as we need in order to smile. Sometimes it's two, sometimes it's 27, but they always do the trick. There are quite a few below, so treat yourself to some pawsitivity with the power of purrs below!Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",
