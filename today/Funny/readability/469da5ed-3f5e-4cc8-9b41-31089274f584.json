  "description": "We don't know about y'all, but we love ordering things from Amazon. That Prime membership has paid for itself many times over with the amount of same-day delivery that we get. However, there is the occasional mix-up. We're not mad about it, in fact, the mix-up usually ends up being better than what we ordered in the first place. It's the darndest thing, really. We open our package, turn around for one second, and poof! All of a sudden, a cat is in our package instead of what we ordered!We're not sure what kind of sorcery this is, but it's purrfectly silly and we love it. These packages may not have what we ordered, but they do contain four cat paws and a whole lot of love, so that's better than anything we could have ordered in the first place. Whatever you're doing Amazon, keep doing it. It's pawsitively meowgical. Scroll down to see all of these boxes below that meowgically made some kitties appear. It's almost too silly to believe!",
