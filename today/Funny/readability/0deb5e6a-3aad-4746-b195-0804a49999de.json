Let me know in the comments? Did they work? Post navigation 101 thoughts on “Does this still work?” Read comments below or add one. Thank you, Jenny! I love these. They do work if you go to the actual blog site. But they do not in the email. But it’s just a simple click to your site to enjoy all the smiles! Andrea Sadly, they did not embed in the email, no. I’m happy to see these again, thank you! There might be a problem on Firefox, but it works fine on Chrome as long as you don’t have an ad-blocker running. Any problems are in the users’ settings I believe, and not inherently in the postings. Can see them here, but not in the email. Yay! They worked for me! Thank you!! I use Chrome and have no ad blocker running. I cannot see the Instagram images. Oh, well! Same as others. Can’t see in email, but can on your blog page. Not that I can tell. I do have Instagram, so for me it’s no big deal to click on the “View this post in Instagram” label on each video. Sounds like Insta is being possessive of the content. I’m guessing that you’d somehow have to download each reel, then upload them to your blog, which would probably be a great hassle. It doesn’t matter to me one way or the other, but I know some folks won’t want to join Insta. I still think YOU. ARE. AWESOME!, technical issues be damned. LOL! 😉 Viewing on your blog, and just seeing the blank boxes with “view this post on Instagram” links inside 😞 No, they don’t work for me. But I am running uBlock Origin to wipe out ads, and it does a great job of it, too. I think, but do not know, that it thinks instagram is all about ads. But I do know that clicking on the blank space takes me to Instagram and I will be able to see the videos, even without an Instagram account. In the email, they take me to Instagram, on the blog, they play as you want them to. Either way, I love them, thank you! Sadly, they don’t work for me. I mean, I can click on them, but they don’t embed anymore it seems. Worked for me and thank you–I’ve missed these! The links work for me, but the email is blank, except for the links. They work, sorta. Click on the square thing and it goes to Instagram where a sign-in thing pops up. Just X out of the sign-in thing and the clip starts but you have to un-X the sound dealy at the bottom right of the clip to hear sound. On a Windows desktop here. Art I can see them in your blog but not in the email. Cats are awesome, I love the chicken nugget thief. Did not embed in the email or blog — has the logo (black lines) and says, “view this post on instagram.” Using an iPd and Safari browser. On my android phone when I switched to desktop mode I can see them They work on the blog, but not in my email. when i first come to the page, they do not embed. but then i refresh/reload the page, and *poof* they’re embedded. all it takes is clicking that refresh/reload button. Where do I get my mini clone? Cuz I could really use one! Where do I get my mini clone? Cuz I could really use one. I use the link from FB to come to your website and each video takes me to Insta to watch. Is that what’s supposed to happen? It used to be that the videos were all playable right from your website Is that what embedding is? They all worked perfectly for me, in your email. I dont have instagram but am able to watch them all here! Thanks I have been missing this every week. Working fine on Safari, and I don’t have TikTok or Instagram. Via email, no they don’t. You can see where they SHOULD be but they are not loading. On your blog page, they are all just blank placeholders saying VIEW THIS POST ON INSTAGRAM Ok, so yes and no for me. As in the past, it is hit or miss. When I first opened your blog they were not there, but then I restarted my PC and now they are there. That has worked in the past as well. FWIW, I am using Chrome and do NOT have an Instagram account. I guess for me it’s the equivalent of “unplug and plug back in”! You always curate such great content that I don’t mind hopping between Insta and your post! Can’t see them on the blog, but I’m running an ad-blocker. I was able to see them on instagram after clicking on the link on the blog, though. Looks like I left my comment on the wrong post- sorry about that! I can’t see a way to delete it, but here it is, again: I use chrome, and although the videos did not show up in the email, they do on the website. One of them didn’t work and sent me to IG, no biggie. 💜 The links work but then I can’t get back to your email unless i close IG and Safari and start over. Not that I have anything better to do! Love you Jenny!! they did not work – as you already heard like 35 times lol. but I’m really looking forward to exploring all the links! So please don’t stop just because of that, I love this stuff 😀 I have to reload the page a few times but yes, I can view them from here They work for me in the blog, all played on the page except one, which took me to Instagram (where it did play). Glad to see them back! There was no thumbnail picture but once I clicked on the links they opened in Instagram. Love the cats knocking on doors!! You have to click through from the email. Yes, it works. I love the first one and fully support that cat’s right to steal from children who are left alone in cars. That cat shamed that parent. (I’m being facetious. I know in this day and age that it’s tough out there and delivery driving offers single parents a way to work without putting their kids in childcare.) I was able to see them. Thank you! I’ve missed your Friday videos! I was using Chrome, and most of the videos played just fine, while a few of them opened in Instagram, but they were all there and you could see what the video was, and play it, one way or another. It embeds links that will take me to Instagram but I’m not fond of that site. Just FYI I am able to see all the videos. I just have to hit refresh when I first open the email and then they all show up just fine. Working fine on Google Chrome. At least one clicks over to IG, but not mad about it. I don’t have an IG account and all I see (email/blog) is “view this post on IG.” Now how am I supposed to see dogs farting themselves awake after a rough week?!?! Nope. Just a series of blanks with the note to see on Instagram. Unfortunately not. I can only see them if I click on them. And here, I thought that it was just me! I always click through to your site so I can give a Like after I read. These all worked here on the page; a couple went to Insta, but worked there without making an account. Fun! Thank you, I’d sort of missed these! Nope, none worked for me but I’m in Canada, might be different. They don’t work in my gmail but they do prompt me to come here to watch them (and some of them take me to Insta when I click instead of playing here but it’s all good). All I see on a browser is a bunch of large, mostly blank rectangles, each of which contains an Instagram logo and the words “View this post on Instagram.” They work on your website which I accessed through your post on Facebook. I’ve missed these posts! They always make me laugh. I can get them to load on your page if I hit reload about 5 times They are strange, but I do get a blue Click on Instagram link. I can see them on Insta then. I’ve missed these. Sadly, they don’t load in the emails. Nope. Still won’t open except in Instagram. I am able to watch them but only in Instagram. Since I don’t get how Insta works, I appreciate you gathering them into one spot! I use Chrome with no adblocker, when I first get to the post I can only see the blank white boxes with the link inside, BUT if I refresh the page (sometimes twice) they all load for my viewing pleasure 🙂 Initially, no. But I hit reload and they all appeared and were playable on site (except for one that went to Insta to play Worked fine for me (opened to your web page from FB). Fun to see these again 😃 Did not work for me, opened in safari. Hi Jenny, Did not work for me 😔 I had to turn off Ad Block Plus for your webpage and then they showed up. Ahh I love the Friday videos! You have to go to Instagram to see them, but that’s ok! This was an exceptionally good batch – I followed three or four new people because they were so hilarious! Doesn’t work for me (on iPad). YAAAYY!!! Gosh I’ve missed these 🥰 I don’t know if they EVER played in my email Only links to the videos. MOFO with the knives is wearing CROCS! I don’t see a preview in the email, I just have to click. Nope, didn’t work on my phone I view these on your blog (accessed by the Twitter link), on a desktop computer, using Firefox (which I continue to use out of habit but easily has the most problems of any browser) and they don’t work for me. I have to watch them on Instagram. But I’m not sure that’s a disqualifying problem. Yes, it’d be more convenient in your blog, but watching them in Instagram does still work. From the email I have to click to watch on IG. But I can see them from there without being signed in to IG, just X out of the box that wants to make you sign in Yes, eventually. Windows laptop, Chrome, no ad blocker, refreshed probably about 5 times like someone suggested, and they finally showed up. It will work with the videos on your website IF the viewer turns off “Enhanced Tracking Protection” in their browser. Basically IG won’t load the videos if it knows you are blocking all their ads and tracking cookies. I think it’s worth keeping them though. Even though it makes me go to Instagram I always laugh at them and I enjoy them very much Unfortunately not for me. Thank you for trying a solution ♥️ No, they didn’t work for me. Chrome laptop. They did not work in email, but when touched, took me to Safari where they opened fine. Can see fine in your blog as well. No, but DONT YOU DARE STOP SENDING THEM. I love your reels. I live for your reels. I don’t mind having to click through to get them. Well…if you mean, do the videos imbed in your email or blog post – sadly, no. When they did imbed, Instagram would force me about half the time to watch them in Instagram anyway. But, if you mean do your collections of links still make me happy and LOL, the answer is yes, yes, always yes, yes please more. worked on the blog for me and I love when you do them Not for me. But I always assume it’s a me thing. They worked! And I missed them!! Thank you for bringing them back! ❤️ Merry Christmas Jenny, I was able to see them and hopefully you can keep posting! They make my Fridays worth the crazy boring week! -Tina on Android, didn’t embed in Gmail, but were all there when I clicked through to the blog. I also couldn’t see them on Facebook (also on my phone). Sorry, can’t see. But I don’t have instagram. Only the ‘View this post on Instagram’ showed up in my email of this post. But here on your website I’m seeing the videos. Of course thoroughly enjoying the videos! I think if you are logged into Instagram on the same browser they work. They just showed up with the view this post on Instagram until I was logged into Instagram on a different tab. This was with the chrome browser on my phone, I haven’t tried with other browsers or on a computer. No they don’t embed but they reliably make me laugh so, SO SO hard, and I desperately need that now. So I always get excited when you share Instagram posts because you’re great at picking out funny ones that make me laugh out loud. They dont embed but we can click a link! Yeah, I couldn’t view. But I wanted to tell you that you’ve been a big inspiration to me. So I started a WordPress blog called “Huh? humor of the dark” in case you might like a laugh back. You’re welcome! (to coin your phrase) Can’t see them without clicking on them. Running on Chrome, no ad-blocker. But yeah, I can click on a link.
