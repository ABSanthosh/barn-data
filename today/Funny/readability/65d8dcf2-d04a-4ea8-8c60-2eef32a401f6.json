If you really cared about the cat, you would want what is best for it, and we all know how disruptive it can be to continually move a cat around to new homes.This is why we say this (almost every time) - cats are a 15-20 year commitment. In the purrfect scenario, your cat survives to be a sweet, soft senior cat who just cuddles and sleeps all day. But if something happens and you and your cat have to be separated for some reason, prepurr to say goodbye, unless it's for a short amount of time. It's not fair to the new pawrents who developed a bond and probably spent thousands on their care while you were gone.Fluff. Chaos. Drama! Our weekly cat newsletter has it all -  subscribe here.",
