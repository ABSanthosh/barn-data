  "description": "If you're looking for one way to see what incompetence and interminable pointlessness look like in their fullest forms, just get summoned to jury duty. Speaking as someone who has survived a two-week-long process myself, I an attest to the fact that nothing truly makes up for the mundanity of the process. Most folks can attest to this, even if they're the lucky ones who have never made it past the selection process.Here, we have a juror who, for some unknowable and strange reason, was excited about serving his civic duty. However, it always seems like the people who genuinely want to serve on a jury are the ones who are destined not to have that experience. Less than an hour into this trial, which seemingly was a juicy, criminal case, one of the older jurors fell asleep and started snoring loudly. Somehow, the judge decided that the only way to rectify this was to dismiss the entire jury and go through the whole selection process again the following day. So while everyone else was relieved to not have to spend the next several days and possibly weeks in a courthouse, this one juror had his hopes and dreams, all because of a tired, elderly lady.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.
