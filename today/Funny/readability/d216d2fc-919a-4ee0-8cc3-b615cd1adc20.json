  "description": "Okay, we know that you have read the title, so before we start talking about this insane story, we have to say: the cats would have totally supported what this woman did here. They would. You just know that they would. They support taking revenge in every way. Cats may look innocent, but they are not. Seriously, no matter how small the offense, cats will do something about it. We have seen cats take revenge on vacuums that give them the jeebie jeebies. Heck, we have even seen cats yell at water with all of their might because it accidentally touched them. So, although these cats probably would not have preferred one of their humans to go… \"number 2\" in one of their litterboxes, based on their reactions afterward, we can only conclude that they respect her even more for doing it. They must have known that her boyfriend was toxic and that he deserved it. If they could talk, we are sure that they would have told this woman that they really respect her game.",

But in this situation, we will totally let that slide. Because he deserved it. And really, it seems like the cats only respect you more after doing that, so they must have known that he deserved it too.  Revenge sometimes is sweet, and sometimes, it is stinky and gross and absolutely purrfect. And we are glad that the rest of the people under this post understand it as well. Good for you, girl, and may you find a decent man who is worthy of both you and your cat in the future.",
