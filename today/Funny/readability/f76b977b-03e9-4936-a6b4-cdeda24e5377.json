  "description": "Your first job is a crash course in the workforce, and usually by \"crash,\" I mean you're doomed to crash and burn somehow. No teenager is just born with the work ethic and the business perspective of their older counterparts, so when company drama unfolds, it's their first time navigating this type of thing.Â This teenager learned quickly how important it is to communicate with both your schedule manager and the owner of the company. After getting caught in the crosshairs of a nightmarish communication scuffle, this teenager was spared the continued employment under inefficient and under-qualified managers. Lucky for them, they were taught a valuable lesson in the workforce before getting set free to find a new job under better managers.",

I was allowed to eat one ice cream per shift, which I happily did, but I learned that I could lure groups of other high school friends into the shop under the guise of handing out 1 free ice cream to the gang. Sure, I was giving away my company's comped snack, but I was selling 5 more ice creams in the process! My boss didn't like my marketing tactic and fired me on the spot, but I know in my heart that he missed out on an excellent employee.",
