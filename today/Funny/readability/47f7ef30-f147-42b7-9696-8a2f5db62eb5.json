  "description": "Hey there, feline fanatics. Gather round for a heart-stealing tale featuring one of the most chaotic and cherished carb-loving cats we have ever met. This story begins not with a meow, but with a mouthful of tacos. That is right, one unsuspecting day, a spicy little street cat was caught red-pawed snacking on street tacos and decided, then and there, to follow two roommates home. They did not stand a chance.The cat, now named Ezekiel (or Zeke, or Creature), quickly made himself at home. Over the years, he has stolen not just bread and snacks, but hearts too. He has earned a reputation as a total menace, but one that his humans fiercely love. From bread thievery to constant supervision of any unattended carbs, Zeke's daily antics keep his housemates on their toes and their baked goods hidden away. And it does not end there. Zeke was immortalized for their friend's birthday in a custom art piece as a taco, naturally, complete with all his favorite fixings like orejas and whipped cream. Because when you adopt a taco thief, you go all in.",
