  "description": "Teens act out in all sorts of strange ways, and this 18-year-old is no exception. Teens truly are an unpredictable bunch. As they near adulthood, they want all the perks of being a grown-up, though they're often still immature and impulsive. It's a difficult balance for a parent to find when they're navigating their child's teen years. How much should the kid be allowed to get away with before facing a punishment? Once they're 18, can their parents still tell them what to do? This teen was faced with an odd dilemma with her own family. She decided to leave her family at the airport! That's such a startling thing to do. Don't we all get scared during takeoff and landing and need to hold the hand of the family member sitting next to us? No? Just me? Well, even so… it says a lot about how this woman feels about her family that she was so quick to leave them behind.",
