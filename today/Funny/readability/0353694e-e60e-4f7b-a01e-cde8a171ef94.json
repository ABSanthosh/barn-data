Who wants a salad after a night out? Nine times out of ten, these fast food cravings could be resolved by just forgetting about it and going to bed, but where's the fun in that? The reality is there is a rush of adrenaline and excitement that comes when you decide to stop monitoring yourself for a moment and let yourself be free. By freedom, of course, we mean the freedom to order a quarterpounder, chicken tenders, or whatever your late-night food craving is. Failure to follow your heart when it comes to these desperate times can often result in feelings of regret or even greater, more intense late-night cravings on subsequent evenings. You might as well just give in and enjoy yourself. You can deal with the consequences afterward.Between now and your next McDonald's order at two in the morning, please enjoy these fast food-themed memes.
