  "description": "You know the saying that's been going around now - he's not the step-dad, he's the dad who stepped up. Well, this is the momma version of that. We love seeing videos of animals adopting babies that aren't theirs. Like when this sweet dog adopted a tiny orange kitten, or this cat adopting an otter to grow up into being besties. It just goes to show that we, as hoomans, still have a lot to learn from our animal friends. In this purrticular case, however, the story is about a momma cat who was surrendered without her babies and saved a litter of neonatal kittens by being their mom.Without her, these kittens might not have survived. Sure, she may have been crucial to their survival, but we also think that they saved her a little bit, too. Sometimes, you just need a reason to keep on going, and these kittens were that for her. It's purrfectly adorable and meowgnificently heartwarming to see, so scroll down and watch this wholesome story below!",
