  "description": "We do a lot of joking around here, guys, but it's time get purrfectly serious (sort of): cats are a purrmanent commitment. If you're lucky, they're around for the next 20 years, which is both ameowzing and kind of scary at the same time! 20 years is a long time to commit to something, heck, we can't even commitment to making dinner plans for later this week! But, when the cat distribution system comes a knock-knock-knocking, you answer, and it's purrfectly understandable to have fears about taking in a new fuzzy family member.On a cross-country road trip, one dog lover (ew, we know) rescued a tiny orange kitten while at a gas station, and after a few days, the responsibility of it all started to sink in. The heartwarming cat community came to his rescue to purrfectly save him from himself, by helping him get through his fears of loving his new fuzzy family member for such a long time. Cat people are the best, aren't they? People helping people, helping cats, helping the world be a better place - it's pawsitively the best thing you might read this Tuesday. In fact, we're sure of it!",
