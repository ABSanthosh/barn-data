  "description": "Ah, the meowliday season. The smell of turkeys in the oven, the cozy warmth of the fireplace, and our cats actually wanting to snuggle with us because there's a chill in the air (little do they know that we keep the thermostat low for this very specific purrrpose). These last two months of the year are filled with feline festivities, purrfect presents, and meowliday cheer. Even though we're still more than a month away from Christmas, we wanted to give you an early present, one that keeps on giving no matter what state you're reading this in: hissterical cat snaps.These silly snaps may remind you of the meowgic you feel when opening up presents on Christmas morning. But who needs Christmas to enjoy huggable holiday hilariousness? At I Can Has Cheezburger, we think that you should be feline pawsitively pleasant every day, so get on your comfiest jammies and run downstairs faster than a cat with zoomies to open up these cool cat snaps (giggle all meowrning long).",
