  "description": "Be careful what you say while you're in court… It may seem like common sense, but many people can't help but mouth off to the judge during their legal case. No one wants to be in court, obviously, but that is not the time or place to start an argument with the judge or your lawyer. As the lawyers of the internet explained, their clients often choose the exact wrong time to blurt out new information. As they take the stand, some people will just admit to their actions, leading them to longer sentences. For some reason, people won't tell their lawyers the whole story. Then when they get to the courtroom, they reveal things under cross-examination, surprising their lawyer. That lawyer can't help the client if they don't have all the facts! Instead of being on their best behavior, other people choose to act out. One dude fell asleep in court, which didn't exactly win over the judge in his case. A different woman had an open-and-shut case. But when she got to the stand, she began acting as if she was in a TV show, being way too dramatic. It turned the jury against her, unfortunately. Check out a bunch of the funniest times lawyers did a facepalm by scrolling below. Up next, read about the parents who chose to see an air show instead of going to their daughter's celebrity contest win.",
