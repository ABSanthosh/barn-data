  "description": "Something that we learned very quickly after we adopted our first kitten is that… kittens grow up fast. One moments, your kitten can fit in the palm of your hand because it's so small. The next second, that same kitten is so big it barely fits in your lap when you sit down. Kittenhood passes quickly, so we have to cherish it. Take those pictures, hang them up, kiss that kitten's itty bitty forehead as many times as it will allow, because soon enough, it won't be a kitten anymore. Usually. Sometimes, a kitten is born with a condition that makes it stay small forever. Meet Mini, a kitty cat with dwarfism. This teeny weeny cat is never going to get any bigger than it already is. It is forever a kitten. Sort of. Obviously, she's going to keep growing up and getting smarter and more cunning, but her size will remain forever the same. Which makes everything so much harder. Everyone knows it's way more difficult to ignore the demands of a kitten. The smaller they are, the bigger their powers of meownipulation.",
