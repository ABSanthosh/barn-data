I love what I do for a living, but no thanks. I’d rather relax with a couple episodes of Bridgerton and a big bowl of ice cream in my lap.” At press time, Haines reportedly lost his temper with a customer who asked if he’d seen Squid Game, yelling at them to just take the cooler full of kidneys and “get the fuck out of [his] face.” Related Coverage Read More",
