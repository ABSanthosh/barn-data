  "description": "This woman doesn't like the way her BF treats his cat, but it's not what you think. It's not that he treats the cat badly… it's that she thinks he's too affectionate with his pet. Family roles differ between cultures, and sometimes the clashes mean a relationship just won't work out. Neither person is wrong, but they stand firm in their beliefs, and their differing values make them incompatible.Here's the issue in this relationship: the boyfriend just loves his cat too much for his girlfriend's taste. She seems almost jealous of this kitty! She writes that one thing that bothered her was her boyfriend saying \"There's my girl!\" to his cat when she ran to greet him upon coming home. (That's an affectionate cat! A lot of the cats I've known simply sleep in closets or under the bed all day, and don't blink an eye when someone new enters the house).Aside from the sweet comment towards his cat, this woman didn't like that he pets his cat. Uh… I'm not really seeing any problems here, and neither were commenters. But the bond between a person and their pet is way too strong to be broken, despite the girlfriend's best efforts. The update shouldn't surprise anyone, but it's still an eye-raising story and a strange perspective on how to treat ones' pet. Up next, read about these gifts that really rubbed people the wrong way, like one person who sadly revealed, \"My mother-in-law bought me a dust broom and she deducted the cost of it.\"",

Growing up on a farm or around animals that aren't treated like members of the family could certainly explain this perspective. For some people who live on farms, there are animals like sheep, cows, or pigs, who are just livestock, and they're in a separate category from household pets, like cats or dogs. Commenters were still really aghast at this person's perspective, though, and if you keep scrolling, you can read her update about what happened to the relationship next.",
