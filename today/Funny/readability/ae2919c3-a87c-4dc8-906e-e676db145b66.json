  "description": "If your bosses are pushing for \"quantity over quality,\" you might want to freshen up your resume and start applying for other jobs. Why? Well, firstly it's an indicator that they don't care about the product they're putting out. You can produce a product quickly and have it still be a good product. As they say, you can have something that is made quickly, cheaply, or high-quality, and you can pick two of those options. If you want something good done fast, it'll cost you. If you want lots of things done cheaply and fast, that's going to make the product's quality suffer a bit. It's always a dilemma for bosses, who want to save money and get the most bang for their buck. For employees, this might translate to rushing around and turning in shoddy work just to make their deadlines. If you work hard to gain your job position, you probably want to make a difference in your field. So when this lawyer's bosses started insisting on quantity over quality, they were not happy about it. Imagine if you took 90 minutes to produce a report, and now the boss wants it done in 20 minutes. That's not great! You can check out the full story below to see how this person handled the sudden change. Next, read about this social media manager who tried to promote an author's work, only to receive \"4 emails in 15 minutes telling me all the things I was doing wrong.\"",
