He just stood there with glazed eyes and an odd smile spreading across his face, and after a while he started repeating, ‘Ya no puede caminar, ya no puede caminar,’ over and over again in perfect Spanish. It was eerie.” At press time, sources reported that a disoriented Miller had been found covered in blood outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center.
