  "description": "We all have that one coworker who seems like they can do no wrong in the boss's eyes. Maybe they're constantly napping, but the supervisor just cheerfully walks by without noticing. Or maybe they constantly leave work early without an excuse, but the boss couldn't care less. Or, if you're like some of the people who answered u/Virtual-Bunch-9131's query to r/AskReddit, maybe your coworker went to further extremes and still didn't get the boot!It can be totally infuriating to work diligently at your 9-5, only to watch your coworker who definitely makes more money than you slack off. Every time you glance at them, they're scrolling Facebook or watching YouTube videos without headphones. They miss deadlines and never know what's going on… but still, the boss loves them, so they'll never fired. Ugh! Some people's coworkers did even worse things and still didn't get kicked out of their positions. It just goes to show how arbitrary things are in the workplace: if you're a nepo-hire or you're the boss's favorite person to goof off with, your job is safe forever. After that, these neighbors were worried that a 13-year-old snowboarder was going to break their fence or have an accident, so they impolitely demanded to \"speak to the landowner.\"",
