  "description": "Being consistently overloaded with work in an organization where the expectations are completely out of touch with reality is a soul-sucking experience… always falling short, no matter how much time and effort you put in.Let's face it: if your team is \"understaffed\" for a long enough period of time, it's pretty safe to say that your employer has no intentions of hiring anyone else, and they consider it to be an ideal staffing level. It's only when productivity and customer satisfaction start slipping that they might consider doing something about it, and they'll probably still just blame their exhausted and burned-out, overstretched workers first.This manager, who is responsible for 35 employees, shared with their boss how they felt extremely overwhelmed by the amount of work they had to do, which included \"specialized\" positions that had been vacant for eight months. Their complaints fell on deaf ears, with their boss choosing instead to throw their weight around, writing up their team members and giving the manager more to do.",
