  "description": "We think that everyone knows at this point that it's the cats who choose the humans and not the other way around. It has been proven time and time again, story after story, that is has now become a simple fact. There's a whole genre of content based on this phenomenon, a type of story that people title \"not my cat\" to capture those moments when cats simply walk into our lives and choose to stay. These cats may decide that you are now their adopted pawrents, or they may be a simple visitor in your home. Regardless, you have been chosen by them, and that means that you are now theirs. Which is exactly what happened in today's story. You, as the person here, will not know where the cat came from or what its purpose is until it decides to let you know about it. For the time being, you simply have a cat, and that's that.",
