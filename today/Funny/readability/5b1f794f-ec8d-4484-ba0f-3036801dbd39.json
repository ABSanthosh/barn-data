  "description": "Bosses will be like, \"If you don't like it, quit,\" and then act surprised when their workers throw in the towel. Like buddy, what did you expect when you put your employees under tough circumstances for low pay? They're going to walk out that door and never look back. Some workers start jobs and then realize that the conditions are unbearable. In this selection of stories, there are workers dealing with both extremes: some chefs got caught in 115-degree heat, while other workers got placed in freezers with temperatures below freezing. Human beings just don't tolerate these extreme temperatures very well, and it's not surprising that they'd flee from such a job as soon as possible. Other people realized they'd never get along with management, and instead of putting up with their manager's condescension even one more minute, they quit mid-shift. If you've ever wanted to get back at a bad boss while you're in the service industry, this is the way to do it. They'll be forced to cover your work, like helping crabby customers or working a grill in high temperatures. If only they'd been a little nicer… Next, check out some employees who made really big mistakes and lived to tell the tale, like the woman who somehow \"printed 500 copies of her gas bill on the company printer.\" Whoops!",
