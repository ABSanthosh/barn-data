  "text": "He thought it was an interview, but it was more of a first date I think the sign of a good late-night host isn’t on display when everything’s going as expected. It doesn’t take the sharpest fork in the shed to run through a checklist of PR-approved questions about what it feels like to play Ant-Man or whatever. It’s when interviews start to go a bit off the rails that good hosts really make their money. The real chief skill of a late-night host is unflappable adaptability, banter, and if you’re Jimmy Fallon, Pictionary.Diego Luna, famous for portraying Andor’s eponymous lead character, is filling in for Jimmy Kimmel on his late-night show this week, and last night he had to catch the knuckleball that was a clearly enamored Tiffany Haddish. Haddish was, theoretically, there to promote something. Sure, across the course of a 15-minute conversation, she did manage to plug her weed company and her live shows, but those were simple asides to what became her clear goal: initiating a romantic relationship with a flustered Diego Luna.The attempts at romance came fast and furious, with Haddish in the first minute incorrectly (and purposefully) interpreting a string of Spanish from Luna as “I think he asked me to be his baby mama,” followed with weapons-grade eye contact and a deadly serious “si.” The remaining 14 minutes are either charming or alarming, depending on your capacity for watching someone get hit on. It’s effectively Luna hanging off the captain’s wheel of an embattled ship, desperately trying to get it back on course while a single siren belts her song from two feet away. Don't Miss Any hypothesis that it’s all for show quickly disintegrates when Haddish shares that she’d googled Luna’s relationship status before the show, saying she’d heard that he’s divorced. Not the lightest fare for a come-on, but you can applaud the inherent chutzpah if nothing else. To Haddish’s despair, Luna shared that he’s in a “very important” relationship as Haddish proposed that they become novios (boyfriend and girlfriend) or straight-up esposas (spouses). I wish Luna and his very important girlfriend the best, but at least if things go awry, he can rest assured he’s going to have at least one Instagram DM proposal in his inbox, posthaste.
