  "description": "Taking on extra work at the workplace is (almost) never a good idea…We're sold this ideal that grinding and working hard will eventually get us somewhere, that all our hard work and determination will one day be rewarded. It is true that hard work, being prepared, and putting yourself in the right place at the right time are the best ways to take advantage of opportunities that might present themselves in the future. But working yourself ragged for your employer and teetering on the edge of burnout is definitely not the way to be best prepared for those opportunities.Without the right mentor or boss, any extra work you're doing will soon go from barely appreciated to unnoticed. Extra shifts, late nights, and weekends will get overlooked as your extra efforts mask over and hide problems, allowing your boss and management to turn their attention to other things and meaning that you'll be blamed now when that extra work isn't getting finished.",

Really, the best thing you can do is put in an average or slightly above-average effort and then talk to people about how much work and how successful your work is. Communication and “peacocking” play into success more than actual aptitude. This worker shared how they were going to begin sticking to the hours they were paid to work and how doing so, and the intentionality and focus that came with it, actually improved their productivity.
