  "description": "Check out part one at this link before reading this update, as it holds a lot of context for the story below.Last time I checked, living under someone else's roof, rent-free, means you play by their household rules. You can't just make up your own list of rules for everyone else to abide by, even if you're their legal family. That's a level on entitlement that will surely get you kicked out of the house, but luckily, the daughter in this story starts charging her live-in step dad rent and gives him a curfew among other household duties to pay for his stay.Why is she doing this? Well, hopefully you've read part one of the tale. Her stepdad has been trying to dictate what she wears, when her boyfriend is allowed over, and generally makes sour remarks in her home despite having lived there rent-free. Everything has since changed, and karma has a funny way of doing it's thing… really well.",
