  "description": "Any cat pawrent knows: when a feline touches your heart, they stay there forever. Whether it's a silly habit, a comforting purr, or the way they ruled your home like royalty - cats leave a mark. Years later, we might still talk about them or feel a lump in our throat when we hear their name. That's not weird - it's love. The kind of love that doesn't fade just because the whiskers do.But there's remembering a beloved cat… and then there's using that memory to quietly override others' boundaries. When someone holds onto a cat's legacy in secretive, shady ways, especially without honesty or context, that's not sweet, it's disrespectful. To the cat, whose story deserves transparency. To the people around them, who deserve the truth. And in this story? The person didn't even admit they were honoring the cat. They just… kept quiet. That says a lot.Fluff. Chaos. Drama! Our weekly cat newsletter has it all -  subscribe here.",

  "text": "In this tale, a pregnant wife finds out that her husband, without telling her, chose to name their future child after his ex’s cat. Not in tribute. Not in conversation. Just… silently. No wonder she feels betrayed. He didn’t just dishonor the cat by hiding her memory - he disrespected his wife and the little one they’re bringing into the world. That’s not the behavior of a warmhearted cat pawrent. That’s something else entirely. Isn't it the worst to realise? She's already furious with her husband, but finding out his mythological ex-girlfriend is beautiful, kind, and also a good cat mama? We understand why this wife would be angry.It is important, though, that we know that Sia the cat is getting good care. Honestly? With all this human meddling and feuds, it's better to know the cat is doing fine.",
