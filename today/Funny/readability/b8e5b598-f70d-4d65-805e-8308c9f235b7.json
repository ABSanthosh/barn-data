  "description": "This person would've been in huge trouble if their boss hadn't signed 2 little letters on a piece of paper! The longer you're in the workforce, the more you learn to CYA. Always document things in writing, especially if it's something you strongly disagree with. That way, when your boss gets upset that you did or didn't do something, you can point them to the email you sent them, or the Slack message you sent, complete with time stamps. Not to mention that just the phrase \"Can you send me that in writing?\" is enough to stop most managers in their tracks. It begs the question, \"Why do you need that in writing?\" and the answer is, well, it's probably because that manager is requesting something so dim-witted that it needs recording. No one wants to look uninformed in the workplace, especially not when it's properly recorded by a diligent employee. This boss made a giant mistake, and lost his job over placing his initials on the wrong thing. It's a tough lesson for him to learn, but it was a very costly mistake that could've been easily avoided if he wasn't so full of hubris. Next, read about the scorned stay-at-home mom whose husband didn't invite her to a work event: 'I ran into the CEO's wife... she confirmed she was there.'",
