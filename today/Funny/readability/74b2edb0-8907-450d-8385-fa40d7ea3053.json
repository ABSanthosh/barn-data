I was curious if I could get my PSVR2 headset working with iRacing on my PC. The TLDR is yes it can be done and it looks great!  Personally I think the PSVR2 headset is the best of the VR headsets I’ve used, even beating out the Quest 3 in terms of comfort and clarity. Sony recently made it possible to use this headset on the PC. You’ll need to download the drivers and pick up a special dongle that goes between your PC and your headset.  Technically this was enough to get it working but iRacing ran like absolute garbage. It was a shimmering, choppy mess. There were so many systems at play here that I honestly didn’t know where to start trying to get it smoothed out. I was lucky enough to stumble upon this incredible video from An Average Sim Racer on YouTube.  This absolute hero gives you all the settings you need. He starts with the NVidia control panel and goes through Steam VR and iRacing showing you how to set everything up. He even helps you edit an iRacing .ini file which is the sort of witchcraft I tend to avoid but I followed all his steps here. The results were amazing and I’m so glad I can finally use my PSVR2 with iRacing. It’s a great combination and if you have the hardware at home I recommend giving it a try.  -Gabe Out",
