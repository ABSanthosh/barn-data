  "description": "If you've ever owned a cat, read at least one article on our page, or have ever spent more than 5 minutes with a cat, you know one thing: cats are love. We love them, you love them, people love them, even other animals love cats. Our cats make us better versions of ourselves, so why not spread all those purrfectly wholesome feelings around? Everyone deserves love and the opportunity to be a better person, so one correctional facility in Indiana took a chance, and it pawsitively paid off!They implemented a feline foster program that allowed inmates with good behavior to foster homeless shelter cats. Not only did the cats get a hooman to love them, but it actually increased behavior in the prison and reduced the amount of fights! Of course, we could have told you this would happen, but it's nice to see it happen in real life. Be the hooman your floofy, fabulous feline thinks you are. See more pictures below, and we hope your day is filled with lots of kitty love!",
