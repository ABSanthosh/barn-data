  "description": "Now that Eric, Kiko, and Grib are all knee deep in monster guts, the idea of running with a full four is too tantalizing to resist. I've just been doing shit! It shouldn't be considered unwillingness on my part. I did grab the benchmark, and it seems like performance won't be too bad, but apparently this benchmark isn't a good indicator of performance? What kind of bench is it marking exactly? Maybe it just indicates how willing you are to install benchmarks. In that realm, dear readers, I've proved exemplary.",

What kind of bench is it marking exactly? Maybe it just indicates how willing you are to install benchmarks. In that realm, dear readers, I've proved exemplary. I've never actually been able to play the game as I assume it is intended to be played, four deep, because it took this long for Monster Hunter to become the phenomenon it is. The game had to get to the point where it was just this ineluctable force, must play stuff, like an Elden Ring or a Bloodborne. It's always been my weird little hobby over here, and now I'm the last one in. Now that Dabe is moved into his new place, I think we might do some squadded Marvel Rivals here until noon or so, but I can only hang out a little in the afternoon so we shall see how the mood strikes him. Starting around ten! Come hang! (CW)TB out.",
