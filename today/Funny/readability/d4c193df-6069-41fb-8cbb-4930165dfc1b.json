  "description": "Sometimes at work, you can get tasked with the more tedious jobs that make you question why you're drowning in student loan debt to end up like this. Whether you're sending endless emails all day, reorganizing piles of paper, or making coffee for meetings that you don't even get to attend, it can feel like you were hired more to be your boss's personal assistant than to do the work you were actually trained for.But some days, that's okay. There are moments when we'd all rather get paid to do a mindless task than sit in a high-stakes decision-making meeting, sweating through every word. But when your hard work goes unnoticed or, worse, is taken for granted, that's when tensions can start to rise. It's when your boss's lack of appreciation starts to show that you might just decide to leave them with a little parting gift, like... a perfectly organized mess.",
