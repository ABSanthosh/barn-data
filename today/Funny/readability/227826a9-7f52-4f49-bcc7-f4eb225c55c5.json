  "description": "Happy Monday, friends! And yes, we insist on making this a happy one. Because we have earned it. We deserve it. This day - no, this whole week - is going to be pawmazing. And we are not just saying that. We are going to make it happen - by starting this week on the right paw, with the right cattitude and with a smile on our faces. And you guys know just as well as we do that there is only one way of making that happen, and that is with a whole bunch of hissterical cat memes first thing in the morning. And we are not talking about just any silly cat memes. Nope, every single week, we bring you the very best cat memes and posts directly from the depths of X. We give this gift to you. We save you the time and effort of looking for the things that truly matter on that app by putting them right here. You're welcome, y'all, and may you all have a purrfect week!",

Look at this little dude. The stance. The presence. The shock and confusion in the eyes. We're obsessed.  Nothing has made smile quite as hard as seeing Wanton's recovery. She's been through so much, but her spirits have remained so high, and we are so happy for her and so thankful to the people who are taking care of her right now. Please never stop updating us about her, we need to know that she's getting better.",
