  "description": "On the job site, always trust your engineer. Contrarily, this nepo-hire project manager only trusted himself and it was wholly misplaced. Without any knowledge of the scientific specifics, he decided to make a unilateral decision that would cost a lot more than a few lost days on the job—it would cost his company millions in damages, time, rebuilds, and ultimately, his career. In my opinion, it serves someone right to pay the price when they've overstepped their wheelhouse. Especially when we're talking about potentially dangerous, life-threatening scenarios on a construction site, safety measures and failsafes are not to be trifled with. Likely driven by ego, this hot-headed personality hire was severely punished for being a total dingus—and rightfully so.",
