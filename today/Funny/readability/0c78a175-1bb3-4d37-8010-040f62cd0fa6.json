  "description": "16 years old is way too young to know how to independently handle your finances, and your parents are supposed to be the ones guiding you towards that understanding. Some do this by giving their children an allowance. That way, the kids can gain some understanding of saving money. If they want a gaming system, they can calculate how many months they'll have to save for before getting one. Or they can choose to buy toys or food or spend the money on gas for their car. Regardless of how they spend it, they'll learn a little bit more about money matters than they knew before. For this teen, money issues are getting in the way of his relationship with his parents. They keep spoiling his younger siblings using his money! The kid is fed up, and you can read below all of the kind advice that commenters had for this young person as he learns some hard truths about family. Next, read about the high schooler who got petty revenge on an entitled classmate who tried to exclude them from snack day: 'The 12 donuts I've been bringing in… doesn't count?'",
