  "description": "When exactly does babysitting become parenting? Or is it the reverse? That's the question that this parent is grappling with, since her son's stepmother thinks she's \"babysitting\" too much!Many parents bristle at the word \"babysitting\" when it's used for the child's parents. For example, it's rather old-fashioned now, but there was a time when people might spot a father out with his kids and ask if he was \"babysitting\" for his wife. No… he's parenting his own children! Babysitting implies that it's a job that you do for a set amount of time, receive payment for, and then leave. So when you're parenting a child, you're a parent all the time… right? It's a question that can be confusing and awkward when stepparents get involved. Some stepparents are too overbearing, and try to force their kids into hanging out with them, leading those kids be resentful. Other times, the stepparent doesn't really like the children at all. They fall in love with their partner, then roll their eyes at the partner's kids. But if you're spending all your time with that partner and building a future together, it's not like you can just ignore their kid! It's a huge part of a parent's life. After that, read about some unforgettably bad job interviews, like on person who 'interviewed someone who... technically wasn't allowed to be in the building.'",
