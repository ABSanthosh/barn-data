The Onion: What about playing Bob Dylan most intrigued you? Chalamet: I was definitely drawn to his characteristic raspy voice because it’s similar to mine when I’m doing Yoda.  The Onion: What did you do to prepare for this role? Chalamet: Oh wow, quite a bit. I must have listened to 20 to 25 music songs. The Onion: Where did the costumes come from?  Chalamet: I just wore the jackets from Wonka and the pants from Dune. The Onion: When did you first become interested in Bob Dylan? Chalamet: Like most people, I first discovered Dylan after running out to buy the We Bought a Zoo original motion picture soundtrack and hearing “Buckets of Rain.” The Onion: Was there anything you learned about Dylan that surprised you? Chalamet: Surprised isn’t one of the faces I do. But I can do “bemused.” The Onion: Were you nervous about singing? Chalamet: What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  The Onion: How did you stay in character? Chalamet: I had a crowd of people follow me everywhere I went to boo any time I used electricity. The Onion: How have you changed as a person after playing Bob Dylan? Chalamet: After being on the fence before, I am now 100% against the Vietnam War.",
