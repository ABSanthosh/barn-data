  "description": "Cats are weird little creatures, to say the least. We can confidently guess that if you're a cat pawrent, you're nodding profusely in agreement with this statement. Cats can really get coo-coo at times, even if these times aren't the best suited for a coo-coo feline behavior. For example, cats tend to enter the zoomies mode in the middle of the night, zooming and speeding around the house while the hooman residents are sleeping deeply. Cats can also stare at a blank wall and hiss at it, just because. They push objects off of the counter just so they can witness their self-made destruction. Every cat has this crazy feral side.Since despite this cat craziness we're still crazy about cats, it only makes sense to celebrate cat coo-cooness by scrolling through a bunch of crazy cat memes. That's the correct way to embrace this cat coo-cooness and maybe join their zoomies session, or stare at a blank wall and hiss at it alongside them.",
