  "description": "We have all been led to believe that weddings are for the couple getting married. That it is a celebration of love between two people you love. But JOKE is on the couple, because, let's be honest, the wedding is not for them. It is for the friends and family, especially, the family.

Unfortunately, in the case of this Redditor, her younger brother was the main issues.

For some reason, the brother was mortified by this plan…",
