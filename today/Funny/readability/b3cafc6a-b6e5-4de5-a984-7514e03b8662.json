  "description": "Abandoning a cat is one of the worst things that you can do to it. Your house cat is reliant on you. It doesn't know any reality except the one that you created around it. Your house cat wouldn't know how to survive outside on its own, the same way that you wouldn't know how to do it, because it has never had to. Abandoning a senior cat… that is simply cruel. A young cat might still have the time, the energy, the chance to learn how to survive outside, but throwing a senior cat out is pretty much telling it that it does not deserve to live anymore. And we don't understand why people do this. Senior cats make amazing pets. They are so affectionate, so calm, so sweet. The thought of our sweet kitty having to live out there, all on its own, looking for scraps, breaks our heart. So, we can only say thank you to the kind people in this video who didn't let this cat be in that situation any longer than it already was. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver.
