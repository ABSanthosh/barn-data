  "description": "Every coworker has their preferred way of working, and part of collaborating in the workplace requires both parties to readjust in order to get the job done. This hotel maintenance worker wanted to be called when any little thing went wrong, even if it meant being called all the time for simpler tasks that other coworkers could rectify without him.

When the maintenance worker returned to the hotel, he was infuriated when a small shower shampoo holder wasn't up to his standards in terms of how it was installed. He erupted at his coworker, who shared this Reddit thread, which prompted some much-deserved malicious compliance.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.
