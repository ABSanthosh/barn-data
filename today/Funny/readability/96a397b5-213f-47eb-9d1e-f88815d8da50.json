  "description": "No one likes a line cutter. Whether it's at the post office, the DMV, or at a restaurant, there is an expectation of decency when it comes to following the social order of \"first come, first serve.\" Of course, most social phenomena should be questioned, dissected, and reconsidered, but every so often, there is one that makes sense because it's what is fair and equitable for all. This might sound over the top, but the truth of the matter is that waiting in line is most certainly one of those necessary social norms.This continues to apply to coffee shops, which tend to be popular and busy in the mornings as cranky customers are on the hunt for their reason to push forward before they head to work. However, no matter how cranky you are or how desperately you need caffeine injected into your system, the social norms of \"first come, first serve\" are still worth following, unless you want to make enemies like this Karen customer did.",

This other person heard her order and immediately hatched a plan to ensure that she would not be allowed to cut in line and receive her drink before everyone else without any consequences.
