  "description": "This snow shoveler knows they were being petty towards their neighbor, and they do not care one bit. In some parts of the world, snow days are still quite common. Some storms can dump buckets of the white stuff, leaving people to dig out their cars while their kids build snow forts. Shoveling a driveway or digging your car out can take ages. You have to scrape the snow from the windshield, dig out the tires, scrape the ice from the door handles, and after all that's done, you still need to dig a path for your car to get out of the driveway. It truly can take all day, and if it's still snowing, you might find yourself out there again the next day doing the same exact thing all over again. That's why this person was absolutely infuriated when a neighbor took the parking spot they spent hours shoveling. With a full 8 inches of snow on the ground, it must've been backbreaking work! You can read the full story below, as well as comments from people who agreed that when you mess around with the wrong person, you'll find out soon enough. Up next, these HR professionals revealed what happened when they had to fire an employee for some bizarre reasons, like one dude who \"bought a car on the company card and… got fired.\"",
