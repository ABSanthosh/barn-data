You signed my book and at that point I had only flipped through the pages.Well, I sat down to read the book tonight and was overcome with shock, surprise and emotion when I saw my secret. It is written in red sharpie and reads: “I was adopted. I’ve seen pictures of my birth mother but not of my birth father. I am terrified that he will recognize me on the street one day. Every time I see a guy who looks about 35 I look for common features between us. It didn’t used to bother me but somehow it has turned into my greatest fear. I’m only 18 but I’m afraid this will plague me the rest of my life…”I immediately started to cry. The amazing thing is. I was at your book reading last night with my birth father, Eric (you signed his book to Meghan). I met him last April, and I couldn’t be more happy to have met him, and my birth mother. He was the one who told me about your book reading.Thank you so much!",
