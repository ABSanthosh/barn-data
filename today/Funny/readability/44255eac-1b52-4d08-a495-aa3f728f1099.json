  "description": "Instead of just making their own highly specific foods at home, some people love to go out to a restaurant and insist that the chef whip them up something special. This type of customer will go to a seafood restaurant and request a special burger. They'll go to a pizza place and insist that they want a small pepperoni pizza… with no pepperoni. No idea what that could mean! The person taking that pizza order also had no clue what that customer was requesting, but to their credit, most restaurant staffers try very hard to give their customers exactly what they want. Some folks just have utterly ridiculous requests, though. Like there's one person who wouldn't eat any of his hash browns? Were they soggy, burnt, or dry? Nope! They were just too hot. Hmm… if only that problem could solve itself in under 5 minutes. After you read these restaurant requests, weigh in on this story of a couple who were confronted by their waiter after not tipping on a $30 bill: \"You're not tipping?!\"",
