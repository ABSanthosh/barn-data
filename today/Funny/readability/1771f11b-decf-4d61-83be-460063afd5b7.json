  "text": "I'd had an inkling for a while, just a little itch in my brainstem, but now it's reached some kind of primal vibration that demands release. I'm feeling very confident , more confident than ever, that Nintendo is going to make another console. I know it rings harsh, like the echo of a mad prophecy. But we're closer than ever, and you can't disagree with that really, because that's just how time works. We've never been more near. I feel its cold shadow. I was tired of it years ago. I don't want to hear another word about it until it's a physical object that has entered the retail world. No more renders! I don't want to be farmed for engagement, I'm not clicking on anymore stuff. Maybe it will wither if I don't feed it. I hope so! We can all do other stuff. If you want to baselessly theorize about the kit for the Human Torch in Rivals, just completely imaginary shit, that I will click on. I'll click the fuck out of it. But no more Mad Catz silicone enclosures or third party shrapnel. I'm officially done. I want them to make it official not because I need to know but because I want the haruspex, the warlock, and the seer to kick fucking rocks. But yes, unlimited mental space now in these early days of Rivals to fantasize and earn pretend currencies to buy imaginary clothes for heroes I don't even use. Mega interest in that. I heard that service hero shooters were dead, but maybe they are only dead if you don't put any heroes in them. I guess Marvel Rivals is free, which probably helps, but I think I speak for a lot of people - even those who take staying free as long as possible as a noble personal endeavor - that once you see the store, on purpose or with an errant click, the game ceases to be free very quickly. Very quickly indeed. (CW)TB out.",
