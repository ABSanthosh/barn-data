  "description": "Once you get a cat, you immediately become a purrfessional photographer. When you have a meowdel as beautiful (or handsome) and as silly as your cat, you can't not take pictures of them. It's purractically against the law. You take pictures of them when they're sleeping soundly, when they wake up and make a funny face, when they clumsily fall off the couch, when they make that \"please, just one little treato\" face…the list goes on, and on, and on…and on! The only thing we love as much as taking pictures of our cute cats is looking at pictures of other people's cute cats! Cats are just too awwdorable to not look at, especially when one cat owner makes a call to the interwebz asking for all the purrfect pawparazzi parents to share their best cat photo. Below you'll find not only the funniest feline pictures, but also some sweet and wholesome ones as well. All thanks to the meowgic of our feline friends (and their pawrents with iPhones). Enjoy!",
