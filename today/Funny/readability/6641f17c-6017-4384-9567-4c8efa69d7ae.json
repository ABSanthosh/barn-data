  "text": "Last night I dreamt that I came up with a single sentence so brilliantly true and simultaneously profoundly false that it would explode the universe and when I woke up at midnight I groggily jotted it down so that I could later decide if it was too dangerous to share with the world and this morning I woke up to a note that said: SPARKLING WATER IS STILL WATER. And…wtf me? Because of course sparkling water is water. It’s literally in the name. But then I realized that “still water” is also another way of saying “non-carbonated water” and so technically sparkling water is still water and is also the opposite of still water and maybe that’s what half-asleep Jenny was trying to say? Anyway, all of that to say that if you’ve ever come up with something brilliant in your sleep and then forgot it upon waking and hated yourself for not writing it down you can read this and stop beating yourself up about it because…Jesus.
