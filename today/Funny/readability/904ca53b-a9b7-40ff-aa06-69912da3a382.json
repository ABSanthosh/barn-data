  "description": "Raising a cat? Oh, you mean signing up for the daily chaos of a four-legged toddler who naps 16 hours a day and still has the audacity to act like they run the place? Yeah, that sounds about right.Being a cat pawrent means accepting that your fancy shelf decor is now a series of launching pads. Your bed? Shared. Your food? Stared at (at the very least). Your privacy? Nonexistent. Especially when you're in the bathroom. And if you've ever been personally victimized by a 3 AM zoomie attack or found a mysterious hairball in your shoe, congratulations! You're truly living that cat child experience.But despite the drama, the sass, the random bouts of destruction, we wouldn't trade it for anything.

  "text": "That's the classic cat pawrent experience - you buy the fanciest of feasts so your cat can eat like the royalty they think they are, but then it's not enough. This food is suddenly yucky, or something. Go figure. It's true, you know? Cats meow at us because they know we never stop yapping, so they developed their own yapping method to catch our attention - meowing. They don't meow to other cats, only to us. Because to them, we're only large, weird cats, who don't even know how to communicate properly.",
