Anything except leaving it in a carrier outside - confused, alone and terrified - and hoping that someone will just pop up and pick them up.Sadly, that's exactly what happened in today's story. This adorable cat was abandoned by its previous owners. It is sheer luck - or maybe the Cat Distribution System performed some of its magic - that sent these wonderful people to save this cat. As angry as we are about the people who abandoned this precious kitty, we are a million times more thankful to the ones who rescued it and worked so hard and for so long to gain its trust.",
