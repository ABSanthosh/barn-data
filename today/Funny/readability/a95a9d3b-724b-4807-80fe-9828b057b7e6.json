  "description": "Scoring a seat in public transit is a win, but the moment an elderly person or a pregnant lady walks in, it should be every decent person's instinct to give up your spot. However, if you're an entitled Karen who decided to wear high heels to your pedicure appointment before demanding someone else's seat on the bus, you're far less deserving.",

Tired from a long day at work, all you want to do is kick off your shoes and relax at home, but before you can get there, you have to endure the sweat-stained seats and the cattywampus timetables of your transit line. For the after-work retail employee in this next story, not only did they have 45 minutes until they were home free, but they had to deal with an entitled woman on the bus, whose fashion choices that morning somehow made her deserving of a seat on the bus. Sorry lady, you knew those shoes would be uncomfortable; that's on you.",
