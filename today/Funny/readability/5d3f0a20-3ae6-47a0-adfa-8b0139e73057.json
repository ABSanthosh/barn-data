  "description": "Flexibility begets flexibility. If you're not willing to offer it to others, don't be surprised when they don't offer it to you in return. This is true in any situation, and just because you hold authority over someone doesn't mean that you don't owe them the same flexibility that you expect to receive. Relationships, including working ones, are a two-way street, and you have to be able to show someone that you're able to offer them the same respect that you want in return. The thing is, some people, quite simply, are happy when things work in their favor but aren't willing to do things for others, and this eventually leads to conflict.This comes up all the time in employment situations where subordinates, who feel like they are going above and beyond their required tasks and scheduled hours, are reprimanded for some small technicality that calls into question their dedication to their job. This leads to a series of events where the worker silently protests by complying with their boss's demand that they adhere to this small technicality, but drops everything else they were doing that's not in their job description in the process.",

  "text": "This employee worked a job with a FIFO (Fly-In Fly-Out) arrangement, where the workforce quite literally \"flies in\" to a usually remote work location with no local availability to hire a team with the necessary skills, or where there is no one living there at all.These jobs are quite famous (possibly infamous) for their rigorous work requirements, which involve demanding work in harsh environments for long hours. In this case, workers were expected to work 8 12-hour days in a row before having 6 days off. Understandably, by the end of each period, and likely well beforehand, everyone was spent and at the point of exhaustion.After starting early for most days, to ensure they were already ready to go when their shift at work actually began, one day the team decided to leave 5 minutes early. This, unfortunately, drew the ire of their boss, who pulled them up for leaving before the end of their scheduled shift.Predictably, after this, the frustrated and dejected team stopped doing the extra time and pulling the extra weight that they had been handling, leading to a drop in productivity that saw their boss backpedaling in only a few weeks.",
