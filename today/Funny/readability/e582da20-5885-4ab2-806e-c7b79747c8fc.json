Post navigation 53 thoughts on “WHAT EVEN IS TIME??” Read comments below or add one. As the mother of two adult daughters, I can say that this makes perfect sense. It makes perfect sense, yes ❤️💔 my daughter turns 30 in March. Horrifying. Happiest of birthdays to you, Hailey! You are awesome. 👍 The happiest of birthday wishes, time isn’t real but our cherished memories are! 🌻💜 Hailey is so beautiful, inside and out. \u003c3 Time is what turns smiles into memories, and memories into smiles. Happy 20th birthday, Hailey! Perfect sense. Even when you know the days are long and the years are short, it still goes so fast ❤️ Wait until your kid turns 28 (like my daughter is). Time just flies. Happy 20th to Hailey! My two adult children just turned 27 and 32 this month. It totally makes sense. I look back at videos of them when they were younger and wonder where the time passed. I was just looking at my video of me and my youngest at the women’s march to protest the Trump presidency in 2017 because his boyfriend was asking about it. The days are long the memories are sweet and always cherished. So you’re perfectly normal. Happy 20th birthday Hailey! Also wanted to say that I believe if you step outside of linear time, everything is actually happening simultaneously, like a chord of music. (yes, probably makes no sense, and I have no basis for this belief, other than it occurred to me one day and felt right!) Happy Birthday Hailey! And you too Jenny! It’s as much yours as theirs. It’s a mom birthday too. It’s very special and time is weird. I love that “Six feels like you are five but you are bigger and taller.” Well, guess what… 57 feels like 37 only you are creakier and crankier. LOL Mine will turn 41! next month…he’s still my baby in my heart. I’m not crying. YOU’RE crying 😭 Our kids are the same age and also both only’s so to say full and empty makes absolute total sense. And that video is ridiculously cute. Happiest Birthday, Hailey!! Makes sense to me and my daughter is 40. My baby turned 22 this month and moved into her first apartment. Empty and full. Happy birthday Hailey!! My baby is 40 years old. This cannot be true and yet it is. Time is a mind-f**k. Happy day Hailey! Happy Birthday, Hailey!!! Happiest of birthdays, Hailey! I hope your day is as wonderful as you are! Precious!! Wishing Haley a very Happy Birthday!! Happy birthday to Hailey! And in my house, we call the flying fur from our dog “Lola Glitter”. You’re not covered in shedding, you have been sprinkled with Lola Glitter. Wah waaah! Happy Birthday Hailey! May your spirit never grow old. We are always our mommies babies until the day we leave this earth, so yes, this makes perfect sense. Virtual hugs to Hailey’s momma! my baby turned 20 in August. He was just a little squishy 5 minutes ago. happiest of birthdays to hailey! i loved watching her turn 6 in the video, thank you for sharing that with us… one year i called my mom up to tell her that time was going by too fast, and she said “you think its going fast NOW? just wait till you’re my age!” she was so right.. my oldest is 40. i look in the mirror and say you are the mom to a 40 year old! just when the heck did that happen? i dont know.. my ‘baby’ is 31… being a mom is being both filled with happiness at what the day brings with your child, and filled with sadness that everyday something is lost, and the child grows up , and you sort of mourn the previous stages.. you cant give your child wings and then be sad that they flew.. ( this is what i constantly tell myself..) hugs to you jenny.. Boy will be 27 in less than 2 months And he has two boys if his own So yeah the feeling is possibly one of the most normal feelings you’ve ever had Oh Hailey, you made it to 20!! what a great video, thank you for sharing. 100% yes. Mine turned 20 last Saturday. Proud of the human they’ve become and sad my baby doesn’t “need” me anymore. Very definition of bittersweet. They were adorable and amazing, even way back then. Geez, I hope I got that pronoun right? Empty nest syndrome is hard for anyone. You’ll be okay. It only goes faster. I have two grandsons older than Hailey. 😳😳 Hope they had a perfect day! OMG. Happy birthday to Hailey of course. That video is precious!❤️ I just want to enclose my daughter in a bubble and keep her safe from this world. But then who is going to help me remember my name in public? yes rite of passage. parenthood and children have so many myriad pathways blessings, e 1. Wow Hailey is just awesome. Love that video. 2. Yes. Yes, that’s exactly what it feels like. Wait until it is 40, then you will actually be confused. My daughter is going through the change. Happy Birthday to Hailey!! The video is adorable! The 24th was my mom’s birthday, too – she is a young 86! My mom and Hailey are both wonderful. …cat hair fairy dust…I will copy \u0026 use that one. ;o) This means you and Victor did an amazing job raising her. WAIT. Weren’t they like eight when you visited us in Denver? Wasn’t that like three years ago? -Phil Jenny, you’ve shared many tiny slices of Hailey’s life through your blog. My favorite was a trip to Disney World (https://thebloggess.com/2012/05/30/it-comes-around-and-around/). You said, “She took what came at her and made it into joy.” May Hailey never lose the skill to take the rain that life throws at them and make it into joy. I have an FB memory that comes around each year saying, “mommy, one day I’m not going to be three anymore. I’m going to be sixteen.” It’s happening in six months. Time is weird indeed. Holy crap. I remember when I first found your blog, what, 12 years ago or something? I don’t remember. I just remember the really cute girl you had. She’s _20_? That’s not possible. My kids are still just 10-12 years old. Never mind they’re living in another state, THEY ARE 10-12 YEARS OLD. Anyone who says otherwise is lying. So if my kids are 10-12, Haily has to be, what, 8 maybe? Wish them happy birthday from me. I love this video, because yes being 5 feels like being 6 and all the rat of the years do too.
