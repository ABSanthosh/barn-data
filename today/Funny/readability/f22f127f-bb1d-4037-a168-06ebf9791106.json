  "description": "Buckle up, feline fam, this cat-centered Reddit post is about to take you for a wild ride. Enter the bride from stage right; she has a cat named Paulie and loves him dearly. Enter the maid of honor from stage left, she has a mild cat allergy and requests to stay with the bride for a couple of months. She asks the bride if she can have a friend watch Paulie while she stays with her, but the bride rightfully refuses because it's her cat and the MOH is a guest in her home. But then, two weeks before MOH moves in, Paulie suddenly and mysteriously goes missing.MOH helps our protective cat mom put up posters for her missing cat, even going to nearby shelters to help find the poor, lost baby. Fast forward four months, and the cat mom finds out that her MOH secretly kidnapped and rehomed Paulie before she moved in. The bride kicked out and fired her MOH, then blocked her. The level of audacity in this post is too heckin' high! You have to read it to believe it, so scroll down to enjoy all of this juicy, feline-focused, wedding cat-astrophe story below. It's one for the record books.",
