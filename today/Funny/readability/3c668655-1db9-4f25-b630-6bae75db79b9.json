  "description": "Weddings tend to bring out the dramatic side of families, as this soon-to-be-married man can tell you. He's dealing with some complicated family issues while preparing for his big day in about a year. A lot of people question whether they're doing the right thing or not by picking and choosing who to invite to their wedding day. For many people, it's a cherished occasion that (hopefully) only happens once in a lifetime. People fret over who to invite: Friends? Coworkers? Acquaintances? Distant relatives? Should random plus-ones be allowed? It's quite the dilemma. Folks often pop onto Reddit seeking advice, but at the end of the day, it's a very personal decision that has to come from the person getting married. For this man, some sensitive family issues have reemerged after he extended an olive branch to his maternal side of the family. After years of not speaking, he chose to invite some of his maternal relatives to his wedding. What a kind thing to do, and a nuanced way of approaching a difficult decision. Now, those relatives are now trying to boss this person around! Up next,  read about the mom who's forcing her daughter to choose between her and her BF over the holidays.",
