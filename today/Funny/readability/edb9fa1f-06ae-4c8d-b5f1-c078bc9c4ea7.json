  "description": "Administrators hold your entire life in their hands. Literally and sort of figuratively, these click-clacking keyboard surfers have the entire company at their fingertips, controlling employee availability, PTO requests, and most importantly, calendar scheduling. Anyone with an ounce of self-preservation in the office would treat their receptionists and other admin folk with the utmost respect, because at the end of each workday, they are powerful enough to pull the strings and find every opportunistic scheduling loophole. However, this hot-headed manager just had to be the king of the office, belittling the administration staff to bolster his own company image. But after CCing the entire company on a rage-fueled email to make himself look better than the admin scheduler, he quickly realized he'd just thrown his entire team's priority out the window.",
