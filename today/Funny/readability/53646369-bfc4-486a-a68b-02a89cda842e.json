  "description": "There is an argument to be made that animal shelters and their diligent adoption processes have dulled our ability to properly help a cat in need. Often we will look upon a poor purr-machine and think to ourselves that it is so sad that no one is helping them, or at best call an animal shelter to see if they can help. But in fact, we should take a leaf out of his heroic hooman's book and just 'take the cat now' and figure the rest out later. Forget about your landlord or roommates, forget about what you were meant to do with your day. If you come across a kitty in need, it is a sign from the Cat Distribution System that your time has come to step up to the plate.And the wonderful woman in this story did just that. She planned to make herself a wholesome home to live out her days in. complete with all the fixings and mod cons she had always dreamt off. But before long she realized that dream was not meant to be, for there was a much greater purrpouse prepared for her home.",

  "text": "Honestly the level of selflessness that this hooman has is undefinable. It puts to many organizations and charities to shame who claim to collect donations to give animals a better life, but here is one woman, single-handedly saving hundreds of cats, without threat of being put to sleep. All off her own back and her own will. We need more good souls like this in the world. This commenter has hit the nail on the head. In some ways, it is indeed easier to give what little you have when you do not have very much. You are much more open to the concept that things come and go. But it is no excuse for the billionaires of the world who own several vacant properties as ‘investments’. Those homes could be housing hoomans, or more cats, or both. Just imagine how wholesome a homeless hooman/cat shelter could be.",
