  "description": "As a parent, it is important to spend time and bond with your children. Sure, the physical bond might be instant with mothers and eventually fathers, but the emotional and mental bond needs to be feed like watering a plant. It's important to learn about your child and for your child to learn about you as a human being, not just as a family member. So, that is why little outings with your kiddos is important.  This dad decided to take his 7-year-old to some fun Canada Day activities. They had a great time and he felt it was great for bonding. But it wasn't until they were leaving that the bonding took place with a life lesson.",
