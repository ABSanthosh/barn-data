  "description": "Zoom, zoom, zoom, your cat zooms around you and you cannot focus on your work. All you can see are flashes of blurred fur, as your cat zooms from left to right, and from right to left. Zoom, zoom, zoom, your cat's zoomies are getting so fast you can barely see him, but oh boy, you feel the gust of wind he leaves behind. Zoom, zoom, zoom, the zoomies make your cat fly, almost, it's very distracting. You cannot even focus on cat memes right now, let alone on your work. Zoom, zoom, zoom, your cat's zoomies will soon break the Guinness World Record for fastest zoomies by a house cat.While you wait for this chaotic creature of yours to cease the zoomies, you can enjoy these on-theme cat memes. they are chaotic and full of fuzzy feline frenzy. try scrolling as fast as your cat zooms. You might see more cat memes in less time.",
