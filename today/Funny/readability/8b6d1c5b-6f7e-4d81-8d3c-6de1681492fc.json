  "description": "We don't know what it is about neighbors being so awful when it comes to cats, but that seems to be a thing. We have heard of neighbors abandoning their cats and leaving them to fend for themselves, which is bad enough, but apparently, it's not even the tip of the iceberg. We have heard of neighbors stealing people's cats knowing that the cats belong to someone else. We have heard of entitled neighbors demanding people give their cats to them because they need the cat more. And today, we come across one of the most entitled neighbors yet. It's been a year since their cat has gone \"missing\", a year since their neighbor found the cat, rescued it, attempted to find its owners and been told by the vet that the cat is in such poor condition, there is no way it belonged to someone else. A year, and suddenly, these neighbors remember that they had a cat, start asking around about it, and once they find it, demand to get it back. The audacity is baffling.",
