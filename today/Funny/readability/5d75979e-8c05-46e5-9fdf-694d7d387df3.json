  "description": "This barista got petty by not uttering a word. Sometimes, the best way to prove to your manager that they were being disrespectful and out of line is to behave exactly how they claim they would like you to behave.Now, when it comes to chatting with coworkers, there is, of course, a time and a place, but it seems like these employees were only chatting it up with one another while cleaning the coffee shop where they worked. There weren't any customers who weren't being served. The coworkers weren't distracting one another from getting their work done. They were just doing their jobs while striking up a conversation so as to make the day a little less dreary. What are they supposed to do? Ignore one another's presence? Well, unfortunately for this author, their new manager decided that today was the day to assert her authority for no good reason. She decided to forbid her employees from speaking to each other. You can probably imagine how this comment backfired…",
