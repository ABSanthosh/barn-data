  "description": "Daylight savings time needs to go. Unless you're one of the lucky people living in Arizona, the rest of us are stuck in this biannual nightmare that wreaks havoc on our sleep schedules. Yeah, getting an extra hour in the fall feels amazing, and yeah, having more sunlight in the evening during spring is cool, but is it worth the disruption, or rather, destruction, of our daily routines that were still trying to figure out? The answer is no.Every year, without fail, daylight savings sneaks up on us like it hasn't been happening our entire lives. One minute, you're fine, and the next, you're showing up to work half-conscious and pushing buttons on your keyboard like you're in an episode of Severance. Afternoon coffee consumption has to be skyrocketing nationwide, while post-work naps become the new norm for the next week. At this point, we're all just barely surviving. Am I being dramatic? Yes, but I'm also sleep deprived. Can you blame me?",
