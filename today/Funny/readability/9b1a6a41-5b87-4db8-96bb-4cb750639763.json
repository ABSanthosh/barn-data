  "description": "Even though people always say you shouldn't burn any bridges when leaving a job, it's difficult not to feel resentment towards your boss if they decide to let you go. After all, they are the ones who decided you are not doing a good enough job to keep you there, and they are perfectly fine with leaving you jobless and probably replacing you with someone else. How can you not resent that?Yet there is still a pretty big gap between resenting your former boss and actively burning bridges when you leave. It doesn't have to be this big rebellious act, but you can still find ways to 'get back' at your employer for their decision. Ways that would ensure they would never hire you again, whether you like it or not.If you know for a fact you will never return to that workplace, and have no desire to ever talk to the people there again, we are not against a little petty act of rebellion as a last hurrah, just like the employee in the story below did.",
