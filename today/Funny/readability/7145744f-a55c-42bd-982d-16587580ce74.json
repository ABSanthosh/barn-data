  "description": "Oh boy, that job market, am I right? Interview after interview and you still feel stuck in the mud. But there is hope yet! One Redditor found a fun little hack to get the job—and it involves roasting the CEO. Yup, you heard that correct. The guy doesn't suggest doing this any change you get, but he does encourage being completely honest during an interview. Still try to be as professional and diplomatic as possible. But if they're serving you bs, you should probably let the chef know, ya know? This guy really let the company he was interviewing for have it after he got asked the infamous question, \"Where do you see yourself in five years?\" A generic question that, honestly, no company really has any business asking. Like, they're interview for the job, that should be enough proof that this person wants to work here…",

So when he got asked that annoying five year question, his default witty sarcasm kicked in before his professional brain did and roasted the company and their ridiculous interviewing process. Luckily, the CEO was on his side… And he got the job!",
