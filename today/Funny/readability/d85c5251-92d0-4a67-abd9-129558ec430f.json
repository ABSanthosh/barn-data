  "description": "We were all teenagers once, right? Remember your first job? You were probably like 15 or 16 and it was probably at some fast-food joint or a silly little franchise shop like Claire's (I was 17 working at American Apparel), right? At the time you were probably thinking it was just the place that caused all the drama! Like, that kind of atmosphere is what made all of your fellow teenage employees argue and date. But now that you're olde, you've grown wiser and know the reality of it all. It was adolescence. Surprise, surprise! Teenagers are dramatic. The only people that might be news too are teenagers. It's the hormones and the fact that we're new to society, at least on a more independent level.  That being said, it's fun to reminisce about those times and that's why there are so many shows like Gossip Girl, Euphoria, or even Skins that are about teen dramas. So we could not read this Reddit post about some teen drama at a fast food restaurant!",
