  "description": "This caller decided to talk to a customer service rep, and tell them exactly what was on her mind. Too bad for her: she's now \"canceled\" by that company!They say it costs nothing to be kind, and that's mostly true. Having patience or politeness can be difficult if you're in a bad mood. A lot of people who have to call customer service are already in a bad state of mind, since they're presumably calling to clear up an issue. These customers sometimes like to insult the call workers. It's as if they're just calling in to blow off steam and have someone to belittle! If they'd just stated their issue to the call center rep, they'd be off the phone in no time. But some customers think that if their problem can't be instantly resolved, it's time to raise their voices and start hollering. At least at some workplaces, the employees aren't required to talk to customers who berate them or use inappropriate language. I wish I could've seen the look on this woman's face when she realized that not only do her actions have consequences, but that she had embarrassed herself in front of the employee she was targeting.
