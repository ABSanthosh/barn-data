  "text": "High atop emerald slopes lies Cheezburgia’s grand capital: spired towers, sunlit plazas, and markets spilling over with vibrant produce. Under the watchful gaze of King Meowrick the Magnificent, the people — noble cats and humble folk alike — enjoy peaceful days of feasting and festivity.Yet whispers of shadow seep from beyond the borders, carried on twilight winds toward the castle gates. Here, legends speak of an ancient evil known only as Basement Cat, demon lord of The Basement. In a small duchy on Cheezburgia’s far edge, rules Duchess Dander, a young noble with an adventurer's spirit and uncertainty in her heart. Still fresh from mourning her parents — fallen in battle against those same dark forces — she clings to her father’s last words: “Basement Cat has risen again…”That single warning spurs her from her cozy halls and well‑padded throne room. Though she doubts her age and her power, she cannot ignore the drums of danger echoing in the forest depths. With nothing but courage, conviction, and a cryptic clue, Duchess Dander will gather a party of unlikely allies… and you’ll decide who joins her cause, and how their story unfolds.This summer, you become Duchess Dander’s guiding paw:Read the full chapter each Thursday on the I Can Has Cheezburger website, and bring the Kingdom of Cheezburgia to life.Vote on ICHC Facebook through Reactions, steering Duchess Dander's bold, story‑changing decisions.Chime in on ICHC Instagram, making a playful secondary choice in the comments.Your collective choices will chart her path through enchanted forests, castle intrigues, and — ultimately — the dark threshold of The Basement itself.Ready to embark?
