  "description": "It's a sad reality, but everyone knows that it's always harder for senior cats to get adopted. Everyone wants a kitten, right? Everyone wants that energy of youth. And it's hard for stray kittens to get adopted. Because everyone wants a kitten with a fresh start. No life on the street means no trauma, it means less fear. So, you can imagine that it's even harder for a stray senior cat to get adopted. The older they are, the longer they are on the street… Not many people would give a cat like that a chance. So is it even a wonder that this kitty has been stuck on the streets for more than ten years? He was just there, existing, getting older and sicker over time, and no one gave him a chance. Until someone did. And although it was a little hard in the beginning, the transformation that George had after getting adopted and finally having all the love that he deserves is absolutely breathtaking.",
