  "description": "This story brings a whole new meaning to \"eat your vegetables!\"Here, we have a young woman who had the unique experience of rooming with not just one stranger but two: a mother and her kid. The good news is that the two parties generally stay out of one another's way and are respectful of their physical boundaries. The bad news is that all this started to change when the Redditor began to notice her leftovers were always missing.Now, the original poster (OP) makes a point to address her sympathy for her roommate's financial situation, but at the same time, the least this lady can do is ask OP if she can have some of her food before outright consuming it all the time. Now, in the time that her roommate had been doing this, OP noticed that anything with vegetables remained completely untouched by the mother and her child, so OP conveniently decided she wanted to eat healthier and began only cooking dishes with vegetables all the time. Eventually, the Karen was unable to contain her frustration at the inclusion of vegetables in all these dishes she was never entitled to eating in the first place.For more stories like this, here is one about a former chef's petty revenge on their coworker.",
