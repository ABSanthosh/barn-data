  "description": "Happy Tuesday, friendos! Tuesdays may be better than Meowndays, but not by much. You're still stuck at the beginning of the week, wishing you could just go back to bed and cuddle your cats for…. furrever. But that's why we like to give ourselves a generous treat on Tuesdays, it keeps us purrfectly meowtivated to keep on grinding to get to Caturday. Some people buy themselves a fancy cup of coffee, others a chocolate bar, but us? We treat ourselves with a pawsitively generous serving of funny feline memes.If we can't snuggle our cute cats at home, we might as well absorb some fluffy feline energy through these hissterical memes that are pawsitively purrfect to take your Tuesday from trash to terrific. They're silly, they're wholesome, and they're purrfectly feline. That means that they love you one second, and the next, you're getting bitten for one pet too many. Right now, they love you, so get to scrolling before they change their minds. Have a great week!",
