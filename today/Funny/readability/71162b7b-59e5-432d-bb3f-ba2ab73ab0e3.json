  "description": "Workplaces owe their employees safety standards and best practices in exchange for their labor. That is literally the bare minimum in any work environment. In the heat of the summer, employees are met with extreme temperatures, especially those employees who work in customer service or hospitality and are on their feet most of the day. You can leave the air conditioner blasting all you want, but proper attire is also necessary when the environment around you is especially oppressive temperature-wise.The solution? Comfortable workwear. It's not rocket science—designing a uniform that is presentable and comfortable for employees requires very little thought, but begs for understanding the employees' feedback. If you're not listening to what your employees have to say, whether that be negative or positive feedback, then you shouldn't be in a managerial position.The boss in this next story sure shouldn't be. He's expecting his employees to wear ill-fitting clothes that are not breathable. In warm weather, the employees feel as though they're slowly suffocating. Sounds like an OSHA violation to me.
