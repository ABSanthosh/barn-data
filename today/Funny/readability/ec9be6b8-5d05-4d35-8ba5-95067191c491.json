If you’d like to get a drawing done by me please take a look at my Atristree site. This page has all the details you need and allows you to submit a request. Give me all the details you can and be sure and let me know if you want a background or not.  Thanks so much to everyone who has been supporting me through these commissions, it really means a lot to me.  -Gabe Out",
