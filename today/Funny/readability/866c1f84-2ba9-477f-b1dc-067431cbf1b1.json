  "description": "We keep telling people, when they get older, that they should adopt cats, that cats bring joy and warmth to any household that they are in. We wholeheartedly believe that. So, when we came across this video of a blind grandmother taking care of some cats, we weren't particularly surprised. What did surprise us was the number of them and the story behind them. This kind old woman rescued a bunch of kittens - 11 of them in fact. And the kittens are not the only ones that she is taking care of. She is also taking care of the momma cats who gave birth to the little fluffballs. 10 newborn kittens in total from the two stray momma cats. The 11th kitten is one that she rescued - asking a neighbor to look into a kitten that was crying outside and bringing her in when no one else wanted to. She is an amazing woman, and you can just see… in her eyes, how happy these wiggly, squeaky kittens make her.",
