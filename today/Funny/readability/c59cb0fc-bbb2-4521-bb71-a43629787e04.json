Any week with spinal taps in it doesn’t count as a real week. Hi friend, I’m writing this from the hospital where I’ve been with Hailey this week. They aren’t sure what’s wrong with them. They thought viral meningitis and then bacterial meningitis and then back to viral and now they’re testing for West Nile and typhus which I didn’t even know was a thing anymore. I’m too tired to make much sense and I’ve been too distracted to draw so this week’s art is the piece I’ve been working on that isn’t finished. Hailey is finally sleeping, thank goodness. The morphine is helping a little tonight. I have all sort of stories to share but I can’t concentrate and need to curl up on this impossibly comfortable hospital chair (that was sarcasm) and try to sleep. If you’d like to send positive thoughts or prayers I will 100% take them. I stopped at home today to grab a shower and noticed that the roses in the front of the house were blooming. I’m not sure when they started but they’re lovely and a form of art themselves. It’s nice to know that even when I can’t create, the world is creating for me. Sending love, me Post navigation",
