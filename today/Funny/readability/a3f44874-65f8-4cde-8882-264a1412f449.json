  "description": "We've all made the mistake of lending money to someone we shouldn't have. Funnily enough, the best-case scenario when we lend a bad individual money, is that they simply never pay you back. The worst-case scenario is something like what happened to the employee here.This employee shared on Twitter a series of texts between her and a coworker after she made the mistake of lending that coworker some money. Instead of it being a simple interaction of the money and a simple 'thank you', the entire situation got a lot weird, really fast. This coworker continued to flood this poor employee's phone with texts asking for more money, food, and rides. Even after the employee blocked her coworker's phone number, they kept finding new ways to ask her for more favors.Some of the texts that were exchanged between the two were shared in this Twitter thread, and you would not believe the audacity of this coworker, so scroll down to read them yourselves. After you are done scrolling, click here for another story of an employee who decided to crash the company dinner after getting excluded.",
