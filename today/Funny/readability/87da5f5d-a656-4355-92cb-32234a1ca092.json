  "text": "Martin is old, Short is a hack — we get it, fellas! Steve Martin and Martin Short stopped by to visit Seth Meyers last night and you know exactly what that means — jokey insults about how Martin is old and Short is, well, short. It’s a good-natured act that the men have brought to Saturday Night Live, your local civic center, Only Murders in the Building and every late-night talker on the air. I’m glad the aging comics have each other to mock but, maybe it’s time to drum up some new shtick.Short went after Martin’s age — again — as the two traded barbs last night. “It is tricky sometimes at Steve’s age when we’re touring, you know. The curtain goes up, and he just says, ‘I’m ready, Jesus!’ And he heads right toward the light.”Compare that with Short’s line from their Netflix special, An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life, “How far into the embalming process did they get before you woke up screaming?” Don't Miss They joke about how their real-life relationship isn’t all that. “I don’t think of it as a friendship. I think of it as a fun-ship,” Martin said last night. “A friendship is when you call them up and say, ‘Gee, you seemed a little down today. Can I come over and maybe you want to talk about it? Is there any way I can help?’ A fun-ship is, ‘You seemed a little down today. Would you call me back when you feel better? Because I can’t stand it.’”On An Evening You Will Forget, Short made a similar joke: “Of all the people I have a fake showbiz relationship with, I feel fake closest to you.”  Short often goes after Martin’s mediocre talent as well. “I am such a fan. I see your work and I’m whelmed,” he joked on the Netflix special. On Meyers, the “I’ve seen your work” setup gets another run around the block: “How did you get this, rich? Because I’ve seen your work.”Martin often takes jabs at Short’s lower standing in Hollywood. Last night, he said, “I gave Marty the script to Three Amigos, and I said, ‘Now when you read this and you come across Rick Moranis’ name, just cross it out and write in yours.’” When Martin gave Short a fake eulogy on SNL: “Marty was taken away from us too soon. But sadly, not before he played Jack Frost in Santa Clause 3.” On An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life? “You know what I love about touring around with Marty Short? No paparazzi.”It’s not that the jokes are out-and-out terrible — it’s just that when the two take the couch on a talk show, we have a pretty good idea of what we’re going to get. What was fun 10 years ago is now familiar, not a great formula for comedy.  My suggestion for Short and Martin? Next time you’re on The Tonight Show, gang up on Jimmy Fallon and rip him a new one instead.  Tags: News Scroll down for the next article SIGN UP FORA WEEKLYNEWSLETTER OF JOKES + TRIVIA",
