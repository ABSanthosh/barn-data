I guess we’ll see if this goes through. I’m too tired to be entirely cohesive or funny but I wanted you to know that Hailey is home from the hospital (YAY!) and feeling much better. They still have lingering headaches and their eye became crossed from a 6th cranial nerve palsy (aka “wonky eye”) that basically just meant that they had so much spinal fluid pressure from the meningitis that it fucked up their eye. The drs think that it might fix itself with time but for now H has to wear an eyepatch and switch it every 4 hours to try to build the eye back up and we plan on covering one with rhinestones as soon as we are slightly less exhausted. Still lots of therapy and drs appointments ahead but I’m just so happy to have them home. Hailey: “Hot gay pirate summer can commence!” We still don’t know what caused it but they ruled out a million things after the spinal tap, including typhus and rickets…WHICH IS CRAZY THAT THOSE ARE EVEN A THING ANYMORE. At a certain point I was thinking they were going to start testing Hailey for “wandering womb” and “too many novels” but eventually they just classified it as “cryptogenic meningitis” which sounds like something you’d get from bigfoot but apparently just means “We don’t know what the fuck this was and we are giving up and would like you to go away.” This week is a lot of work, follow-ups, medical stuff and another endoscopy to make sure my cancer is staying lazy and I felt like I was doing really well until Victor said he was worried about me and that he wanted me to go with him to Vegas this weekend so I can get away and just rest in the room and I had a panic attack just thinking about leaving Hailey even though they are fine, and I suspect this is a little ptsd and a sign that I absolutely need to get away or that I will never leave Hailey’s sight for the next 10 years. One or the other. That sentence was too long but I am too tired to fix it so instead of rewriting it I am going to go sit outside and breathe deeply for a few minutes. Thank you for listening and being there. It meant a lot. It still does. Post navigation",
