  "description": "If there's one thing homeowners don't play around with, it's their property lines (and what goes on their property). If someone takes it upon themselves to start parking in a homeowner's driveway, you bet the homeowner is calling a tow truck ASAP. As they should, though. Too often these days, folks believe they're entitled to anything they want, and this often leads to a serious widespread case of entitlement that will be passed down from generation to generation. To even the score, folks who are victims of entitled people must rise to the occasion and combat their entitled ways—then share it with the rest of us because, well, it's entertaining.The homeowner in this next story uproots the freshly-planted trees that were on their property, only to find out their neighbors had planted them there because they wanted a better \"view\" from their window. So, instead of asking for permission, they planted the trees without asking and now dare to demand the homeowner compensate them for the trees lost. Nice try. Scroll to read.",
