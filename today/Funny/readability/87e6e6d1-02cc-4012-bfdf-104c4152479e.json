  "description": "Saying \"goodbye and good luck\" to a job you can't stand is such an empowering feeling. You know you're on to bigger and better things, while the managers you despise stay behind. When an employee starts considering leaving a job, there are a lot of factors to consider. They'll have to polish up that resume and start job hunting, which is a full-time job on its own. They are probably sick and tired of their boss, and maybe they're fed up with their coworkers and job duties as well. As they seek out a new position, they'll learn that the grass really is greener on the other side! A new job will not only treat them better, but will pay more and have better benefits. The current job often won't beg that employee to stay. They'll accept that two-week notice and start immediately searching for someone new to fill the role. For these people, quitting was an easy choice. U/virtueandsin got people to spill the beans about their final straws in the workplace, from mean bosses to petty customers and more. You can read all about it down below! After that, read about some family drama: this father excluded his son and daughter-in-law from a family trip, and they were incensed when they realized the truth about where the trip was scheduled!",
