  "description": "Thanks to these dating stories, you'll know exactly what red flags to look out for on your next first date. Dating is hard, no doubt about it. It may seem like there are 8 billion fish in the sea, and only a few of them are a good catch. There are so many people in the world, and only so much time, so you don't want to waste your time dating the wrong person. At least for some people, their date's red flags revealed themselves from the very start. There will be times when you're on a date with someone and realize in real time that there won't be a second outing. They say something so dumb or so egregious that you have to immediately write them off. It can be frustrating after spending weeks texting with them, or talking on the phone for a while, but in the end, you'll have to start all over again. It's not easy to find love in this world, as the people below can tell you from their own personal experiences. Next up, read about the employees who decided to quit their jobs as quickly as possible, like one person who smugly decided that it was time for a \"No call no show for me.\"",

  "text": "I don't know about you, but I have zero tolerance for “negging” during my dates. It's like a backhanded compliment, but meaner! Your future spouse should never say things to you like that, and luckily this person realized that before going out on any more dates with this impolite fellow. He also seems like a real Mommy's boy, which doesn't appeal to many of the single ladies out there.  Sometimes people just straight-up inform you about how off-the-wall they are, and this is one of those instances. Beware of the person who claims to have instantly fallen in love with you… Even if you really like them, it's a waving red flag that spells out a chaotic relationship should you choose to pursue it.",
