  "description": "The internet is totally divided: did this person handle their surprise party the right way, or were they totally out of line? It all depends who you ask, according to the commenters on this story from u/noparty4me88. As you can guess from their username, this person does not like parties for themself. They mention that they didn't ever have parties for their own birthdays, not even the major birthdays that often get large celebrations like their sweet 16 or their 21st. Some people just don't like all that attention. Instead of enjoying the party, they just get nervous that everyone is celebrating them, and find all that socializing to be way too much to handle. This person really insisted that they did not want a birthday party under any circumstances. But their family still threw them one! Commenters couldn't agree on how this person handled the situation, though, with some calling the original poster insensitive. Others thought that this person had every right to walk away from a party they so clearly communicated they didn't want. However, in the real world, this person's family will probably think they're in the wrong for fleeing their party. After all, the family members dedicated a day to celebrating this person, only to show up to a party with no host… Check out the full story below and see which side of the debate you end up on. After that, read about this bad neighbor who claimed he'd tattle to the city if his neighbor didn't get his collapsed fence fixed up.",
