  "description": "Taking care of a friend's cat seemed like a simple favor for this 27-year-old, especially since the friend's apartment was close to her work, making the commute easier. She stayed at the apartment from Wednesday to Saturday morning, happy to help and confident the cat was well cared for. But when her friend's flight got delayed, the situation got complicated.The friend asked her to make a two-hour round trip to feed the cat an extra meal. She explained she was already out having dinner and had plans afterward, believing missing one meal wouldn't hurt the cat. However, her friend reacted strongly, sending urgent messages and accusing her of neglect.Now, she's left wondering if she was in the wrong for refusing to drop everything to feed the cat during a delay. Was she being careless, or was she reasonable in expecting the cat to be fine for a short time without extra attention? She returned the key and set boundaries but feels conflicted, curious whether others think she should've done more or if she made the right call standing her ground. After all, sometimes even the best intentions can leave you tangled in a catty situation.Fluff. Chaos. Drama! Our weekly cat newsletter has it all -  subscribe here.",
