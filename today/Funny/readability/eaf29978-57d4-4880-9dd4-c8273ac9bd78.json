We know you're like us, we can smell the feline fanatic fans through the screen, like cats with a very good sense of smell. But that's okay, you're in good company here, because we're all the same as you - one step away from becoming crazy cat ladies. So, \"crazy\" is in the name, yeah? So we ignore Mondays. Instead of a regular office Monday, we party with all the office cats like it's still the weekend.We know not everyone can do the same, but we want to share this healthy practice with all you feline fanatic fans. So we gathered some cat memes that portray the pawrecious party of ignoring Monday. It really feels like a feline-filled weekend instead. You should try it, these cat memes are silly enough for you to feel as if it's still the weekend. P-p-p-p-p-pawrty 'till we drop.",
