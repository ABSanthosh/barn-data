  "description": "If you've never woken up in the middle of the night to something crashing and breaking in the middle of the night, have you ever really owned a cat? One of the first things you learns as an owner of a fluffy feline is that they are equally as chaotic as they are cute. They will snuggle with you one second, then zoomie off into another room at the speed of light and start climbing your curtains like their own purrsonal jungle gym. And yet, we still love them.Cats are not like dogs. Dogs are trainable - you can train a dog to be a better pet. Cats, not so much. Sure, they can be taught a few things, but they're going to remain a cat their whole lives, meaning they will be both your angel and your devil. It's part of the package, you have to take the feisty with the fluffy. If you don't believe us, we have plenty of cute and chaotic cat memes as evidence for our point. But for now, enjoy these hissterical pictures of cats being absolute agents of adorable anarchy. Or, for short, cats just being cats.",
