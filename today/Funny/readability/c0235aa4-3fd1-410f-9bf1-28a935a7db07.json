  "description": "Only 8 days until Christmas, feline fam! So far, our Christmas tree has only been knocked over twice, which is an all-time low for us in the many years of being cat pawrents. Last year, we hit a record high of 12 holiday mishaps, and all of the criminals have been identified, but not charged. In fact, they still live in this very house! They paid for their crimes with lots of cuddles, but this year, we're taking matters into our own paws and fortifying our Christmas tree with some festively funny feline memes. That ought to keep those hooligan house cats away…right?Oh, who are we kidding, we know that it won't stop any more crimes from being committed against our Christmas decorations, but it will help us laugh through the pain of cleaning up broken ornaments or torn tinsel for the next couple of days. We love our cats, we love our cats, we love our cats…we really do, but we could do with a little less Christmas chaos this year. Do you think Santa Claws could bring us some of that? Anyway, enjoy these festive, funny feline memes, and we hope your holidays are more Christmas and less Hiss-mas!",
