  "description": "Adopting a cat can come with a whole bunch of surprises. Anything ranging from adopting a little feline and then finding out that this cat needs emotional support snap peas to carry around all day all the way to adopting a cat that keeps growing bigger and bigger, and suddenly finding out that you accidentally adopted a wild cat instead. This story that you are about to read falls somewhere in the middle of the madness. Honestly, at this point, we think that it is not uncommon for cats that are pregnant to look for humans to adopt. They know that very soon, they are about to be surrounded by a bunch of wiggle little kittens and that are going to need some spare babysitters around. We only wish that these cats would stop dropping their pregnancies on us as surprises. Let us know. We'll help. They don't need to hide it. But alas, they do, and we simply have to stop and appreciate their surprise as the pawsome one that it is.",

Someone else might have panicked and regretted getting the cat, but you didn't, and we're thankful for that. She deserved a good human, and it looks like she got one.  Really, we were not worried about these kittens for one second. No wonder they all got adopted out. It would have been the easiest thing in the world to do. One look at this picture of the three of them, and we would have been the ones rushing to adopt. So derpy. So cute. We love them all.",
