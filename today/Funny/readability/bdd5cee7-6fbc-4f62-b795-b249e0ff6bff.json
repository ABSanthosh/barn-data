  "text": "It's true, though. Sorry. We made another Jump Ship comic. Which is also a strategy guide…? I'm told such guides are a hot commodity. The only part I neglected to mention was the Materia, which is the omni-gel of this setting. You get it on missions and also from equipment you don't need, or are so desperate you must do without it - there's a grinder in the basement dungeon where I dwell that is always hungry. Sometimes the ship is so fucked up I have had to yank a priceless artifact and transform it into a uniform powder. I use that powder to make anything we might need from the replicator thingy. My skills in this regard are so certain, so sure, that I can usually give the ship enough integrity to get destroyed by something else later. The first time we played, we hit a wall where we weren't efficient enough to really do stuff and got wrecked by the \"easy\" mission we chose to feel tough and cool. Gabe said he liked the game but was gonna wait for it to come out. But then he called me the next day? All our failures seemed ready made to turn us into a single clockwork organism; we just started shredding the content. Gunnery's time to kill got cut in half. I started prepping every object we needed ahead of time and placing everything in the areas it was needed, which of course makes sense, but is much easier to do when you aren't being razed by a Legion sortie. Pilot had their shit dialed in, also - flying through rich Materia clouds during the fight, which gets captured by the external collectors. Anyway, yeah. That's why we started writing all these strips. Shit like that. #Fridabe and I are gonna fuck around with Tempo's \"The Bazaar\" again, because it's at the crossroads of a bunch of different gaming trends and has somehow masterfully orchestrated them into a single thing. We've been starting at noon and then the stream keeps going past 2 because we're doing well, so we're gonna just try starting with it and seeing how that goes. (CW)TB out.",
