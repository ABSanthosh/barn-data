  "description": "Everyone remembers being asked as a kid what they wanted to be when they grew up. A firefighter. A ballerina. A veterinarian. When you grow up a little bit, these dreams will probably change, but everyone does have that elusive \"dream job:\" the one job you could work every day of your life, and it would never feel like work. It's rare that you make it to your dream job, so the dream changes and gets a little smaller. In this case, it's best when you hit the sweet spot of a job: it isn't your whole life, but you enjoy the work you're doing, and you believe it's meaningful work. That's the ideal life we all want to live. We feel comfortable in our means, we do work we're proud of, and we can still live a good life outside of the 9-5.When you secure this position, life feels like Swiss cheese. But, like many things in life, your job can pull the rug out from under you faster than your first paycheck hits your bank account. One woman gets unsavory information about her position at her seemingly perfect job. Should she keep her wits about her and be prepared to look elsewhere, or should she remain hopeful?",
