  "description": "The fact that you shouldn't take something that isn't yours without asking isn't okay is one of the simplest lessons you learn in your life, and, really, it's best that this lesson is learned as early as possible. Now, that doesn't mean that we won't grow up and make mistakes or cave into that devil on our shoulder every now and again and help ourselves to something we know we really shouldn't, but in those times we'll at least know we've done something wrong and hopefully the act itself won't be so severe. There is, of course, a gradient of severity involved here; \"borrowing\" someone's pen with or without asking because you forgot yours and then never giving it back is not the same thing as \"borrowing\" someone's car.",
