  "description": "Hey, pals! How are your cats doing today? Have they received their daily quota of one million tiny little forehead kisses yet? If not, you should probably get on that—right after reading this.Today's featured post revolves around the concept of a roast—a playful tradition of good-naturedly poking fun at someone (or something). In this case, the subject of the roast is none other than the original poster's strikingly silly-looking orange cat. And when we say \"strikingly silly-looking,\" we truly mean it. This little guy appears as if he's been through the washer and dryer, only to be hit by a bolt of lightning immediately afterward. His hilariously expressive face and delightfully disheveled stature come together in perfect harmony, making for an absolutely ridiculous and lovable appearance.Embracing the spirit of fun, his cat parent invited the feline-loving corner of the internet to join in on the roast, and the commenters did not disappoint. They delivered some of the wittiest, most playful burns imaginable—proving once again that the internet takes no prisoners when it comes to a good roast.",
