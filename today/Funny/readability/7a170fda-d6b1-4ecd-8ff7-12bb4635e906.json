  "description": "This story, friends, is why we keep telling everyone that, one day, we will end up on the news for trying to pet something that we shouldn't. Because there is no way that we would not have tried making friends with this puma. And it's not our fault that we want to do this! Not totally… It's just that we keep seeing videos of people cuddling with cheetahs, and people hanging out with lions, and of people adopting rescued black panthers, and it just means… that it's pawssible to be friends with big cats. It's pawssible. This story is an oldie but goodie that re-popped up on the internet recently and for good reason. Because although you wouldn't think that a cougar breaking into someone's house would be cute, it totally was. No one was hurt, and the puma, more than anything, was interested in being the cat that she is and destroying some blinds. Because that's what cats do, no matter what size they are.   Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

A puma, a puma like those you see in the zoo,' said Amalin Haddad from the Lo Curro area of Santiago, Chile to Sky News. The 2-year-old cougar did not attack her or anyone else, and the footage that was taken made it clear that she was mostly interested in chewing on a window blind.  02\"So... a cougar broke into my friend's house this morning.\" 03 04 Ms. Haddad's son, who was still sleeping at the time, told reporters: \"I was sleeping when all of a sudden I heard screams, 'It's a puma!' I came down and we really had a puma locked in the kitchen.\" And the neighbor, who saw all the commotion, explained what happened: \"The people from SAG [agricultural service] shot it with three darts so it would sleep so they could take it out. But I think he took them out, so it did not work. And that is why it has taken so long to get it out.\" 05 06 07 At the end, the puma was successfully sedated and removed from this house. Afterward, it was taken to the national zoo where it was treated for minor injuries, and although we don't know exactly what happened after that, since we couldn't find an update to the story anywhere, we choose to believe that this beautiful feline was released back into the wild, where it belonged. And possibly given some extra blinds to play with as a parting gift.  08 09 10 11 12 Amalin Haddad talking to reporters after the incident.  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 Tags Scroll Down For The Next Article",
