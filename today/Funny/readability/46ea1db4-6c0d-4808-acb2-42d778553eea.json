  "description": "When it comes to encountering a completely reckless and aggressive driver who has no business on the road, it's difficult to know what to do. Sometimes they can be extremely volatile and it's scary to confront them. Sometimes the road rage in drivers is so overwhelming, you truly can't predict what they are going to do next. But sometimes they are so heinous, you feel an obligation to approach them. For instance, when they are an idiot driver AND a litter bug.  The combo is atrocious. Sure, decades ago you wouldn't even bat an eye at someone throwing trash out of their window, but now it's nauseating. After everything we've learned about the environment you're still going to be trashing it like that? Come on. I thought humanity has evolved at least a tiny bit from that?! Apparently not, but some of us have and just like this Redditor, some of us make sure there is instant karma when you're driving like a clown and littering.",
