  "text": "I don't really go in for Remasters generally, there's always somebody doing something new and incredible and I never want to miss it - I always want to get in just as it's being removed from the oven, where consensus has yet to transform a dynamic, hand-made experience into a number. But I do get excited when I think that a new person might come to discover our Old Ways through one of them, and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is very particular vertical slice of an era. With its warping, three dimensional worlds and its fairly profound story - a showcase for Amy Hennig, from which she mounted a fairly profound career - it was doing shocking things on the PS1. It has some incredibly hard lines - bars, in the modern parlance. I hope someone unearths this time capsule and gets all the way up their ass in some Wikis because it absolutely warrants it. I seem to remember how you're actually another character's sword stuck in a timeloop or something - this is like twenty-five years ago now. What Gabriel remembers is that you can pull down your mouth wrap thing and suck up souls like a malevolent vacuum cleaner. Between the two of us, I think we basically have the whole thing contained. The original was a game we played in the hallowed Apartment 26, the very womb of this wicked site. Indeed, we marked the occasion in this ancient strip. This was back when every comic was penciled, then inked with a pen that I think said \"Bristol\" on it, then scanned, then colored, and then uploaded via FTP. Then, I would manually enter the strip URL for the page I made into an increasingly unwieldy dropdown. A dropdown is not a database, no matter how I might have tried to make it so. Now we have containers and shit. But then, wow. I remember thinking that his little Wombat wrap was so good - all the little folds and stuff, and I said so when we were writing it. He put it in today's strip, presumably for me, but if there are any other wizened coots out there you are welcome to enjoy it also. (CW)TB out.",
