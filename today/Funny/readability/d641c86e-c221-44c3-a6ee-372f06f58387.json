Those heightened adrenaline levels are just your body’s way of preparing you to make the 12-foot leap to the next building so your pursuers can’t bag you, force a shock collar around your neck, and take you to the kind of clandestine facility people don’t escape from.” At press time, a supplementary study found that anger is a perfectly natural response for government agents finding their target’s trail has gone cold at an open storm drain.
