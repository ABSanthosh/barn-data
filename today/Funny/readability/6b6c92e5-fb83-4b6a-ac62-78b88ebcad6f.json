  "description": "Not all people have the same amount of tact, and that's fine. We all come from different backgrounds, were born in different eras, and have wildly different interpretations of what is and isn't okay to say out loud. And then there's Liz.  Liz is the human embodiment of a social mess-up, someone who barrels through conversations like a freight train with no brakes. She treats insults like party favors, casually tossing them out with a laugh and a shrug, insisting it's all harmless fun. The words sting, but Liz can't fathom why—after all, in her world, it's not the comment that's wrong, it's your inability to find humor in being the punchline.",

  "text": "It’s not the lack of sensitivity that’s the issue—it’s the absolute refusal to admit when she’s crossed a line. Liz doesn’t apologize; she doubles down. Instead of reflecting on why someone might feel hurt, she chalks it up to their failure to appreciate her infallible sense of humor. It’s a one-way street where Liz is always the comedian, and everyone else is required to laugh or risk being labeled humorless.  The tragedy of a Liz-type is the obliviousness that accompanies the catastrophe—completely unaware that her words cut deeper than she’ll ever know. For Liz, tact isn’t a skill to master, it’s a limitation to ignore. And for everyone else? It’s a lesson that some people mistake cruelty for charm. Let’s hope evolution does its magic and adds some sort of bone that makes Liz-Sapiens’ mouth immediately close when they’re about to throw an insult. You know, teach a historical lesson something about the survival of the politest, and make the Liz-Sapien population a museum artifact instead of an office troublemaker.",
