  "description": "Everyone has their own adoption stories. Some of us get adopted by cats on the street. Some of us get adopted by cats in shelters. Some of us wake up one morning to find a cat that is not our own sleeping in our houses, on our beds, and suddenly, we get adopted like that. You never know when you, as the human, will be adopted by your cat, and you never know which cat it's going to be. You just know that whichever cat it is, if you get adopted by it, you will be blessed. Some of you may think that getting adopted by a trashcan kitty is a bad deal. It's a trashcan kitty after all. But you don't understand. Trashcan kitties are some of the most loving, appreciative cats in the world. They have been through a lot. They're strong but ready for love. And they are ready to make you stronger too. You have to learn their ways. So, yes, you will have peace and quiet for a while with them, but then… get ready for your training. It will be difficult.",

  "text": "There is nothing better than trashcan kitties. They are some of the best pets. Truly. Because they are so, so thankful that you got them out of that life. They are so happy from every little thing that you give them. For a while. After that, they become the most spoiled drama queens ever. And we love that.  These are good people right here. Opening your home to a cat in need is one thing, but being kind enough and patient enough with it that your relationship with it strengthens so quickly is another. This kitty will be happy here for the rest of its life, we just know it.",
