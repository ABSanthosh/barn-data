  "description": "Being the 'new guy' in a workplace is never an easy role to assume. No one wants to be the outsider, the one who doesn't know anyone's name, and needs someone else to guide them through the office's etiquette and unspoken rules. It usually takes months, or the arrival of another new employee, for one to finally be rid of the 'new guy' label, and even then, it still takes time until you completely blend in.Usually, when you're the new employee, you tend to stay out of trouble. You want to fit in, so you don't make a fuss. You first learn everything that there is to learn about your boss and your coworkers, and only when you have gathered enough information (and obviously, the confidence) do you start to consider the possibility of offering a change.Never have I ever heard of a determined new hire who, within their first month in a company, managed to make a change that would benefit everyone around them, but that is what happened in the story below.",
