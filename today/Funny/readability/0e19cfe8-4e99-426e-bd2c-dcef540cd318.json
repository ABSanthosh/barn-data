  "description": "Okay, so we know, as much as we love trashcan kitties, that there are some people out there who have the money and want to invest it in buying a \"fancy\" cat. We know it. And although we 100% believe that people should adopt cats and not shop for them, we do, on some level, kind of get it. Because we love rare cats too. We love Norwegian forest cats and all their floof. We love hairless sphynx cats in all of their uncooked-chicken-looking glory. And of course, we love the majestic Maine Coon cats. If we ever happened to be adopted by one of those breeds, or any other, we would be thankful for the honor bestowed upon us by the Cat Distribution System, and we would make sure to pamper these cats the way that they deserve to be pampered. Would we buy a cat like that? Most likely not. We would look to adopt one. Would we buy a cat like that for $4000? No. Would we return the beautiful cat that we bought for $4000 dollars because it turned out to be deaf? No chance in friggin' hell.",

  "text": "First of all, we have to say that $4000 is a huge amount of money when you could just… get a dumpster kitty or something. But fine. We may not like it, but we know that practices like these are something that happens. Returning a cat that cost $4000… that's beyond us.  There is a part of us that wants to know whether they ever got their money back or not. This new owner didn't have to pay a dime. Maybe it's vindictive, but we hope that they didn't get a refund. Maybe that way, fewer people will want to buy cats in these situations, and then the demand for a practice like this will go down.",
