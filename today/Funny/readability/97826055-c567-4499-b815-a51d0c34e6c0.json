  "description": "We look at our cats at home sometimes, and we think about just how much we spoil them, how we try to spend every moment with them making them happy. That happiness matters. We think it helps them live longer and healthier lives. But not every cat is this lucky. The cats that grow up outside, in the harsh conditions of the outside world… those cats don't always have the best starts at life. Cats like the one in this story is why we rescue cats off the streets - because this is no way to live. Today's story is proof that rescuing sick cats is the best thing that you can do for them. They need your help, whether they know it or not. His start may not have been a good one, but with a little love and care and time, this cat has made a huge transformation. You would not even recognize him now, and that is a good thing. He went from emaciated to an absolute rock star. The one thing that hasn't changed is just how much he loves and appreciates the people who have helped him.",
