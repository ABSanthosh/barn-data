No matter how good you are at your job, your boss could decide to give you the boot tomorrow, and by the next week, they'll have a replacement doing the exact same job as you. Still,  it can be hard to leave a bad job. You might feel irreplaceable at your work, and wonder who would take care of your duties if you left. It might make you wonder what would happen if you didn't show up at your desk tomorrow… really, what would your bosses do? Well, this worker got to find out exactly the answer to that question! U/Warrior044 shared their very, very long story about what happened when their boss threatened to let them go. In fact, the boss left them with a signed contract, which was a pretty basic mistake.
