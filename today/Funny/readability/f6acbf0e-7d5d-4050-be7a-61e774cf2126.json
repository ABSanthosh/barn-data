  "description": "What would your cat tweet about if they could? If cats could do that, generally, we're sure there would be a scene of live-tweeting about the hours of the cat waiting for their hooman to wake up. There would also be a popular meme that says \"Hooman not hoomaning\" where the cats would upload a picture with their half-empty food bowl (oh, no!) with their hooman doing nothing in the background - and definitely not filling the half-empty bowl. We're also really sure there would be so many funny cat tweets about zoomies competitions.But until evolution gives cats thumbs, all we have are tweets that cat pawrents wrote about their cats. These are absolutely ameowzing, and we endorse cat-tweeting so much. It's like the little happiness corners inside all of X. And guess what? We went through all the trouble of gathering these, so all cat pawrents here could relate. As cat pawrents ourselves, we feel validated by them. Also, they function as some of the funniest cat memes out there.",
