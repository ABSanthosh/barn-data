Today Kerry sends us a \"fun\" little twist, in C#. return (someCondition || someOtherCondition) ? Boolean.Parse(\"true\") : Boolean.Parse(\"false\"); The conditions have been elided by Kerry, but they're long and complicated, rendering the statement less readable than it appears here. But here we've taken the \"if-condition-return-condition\" pattern and added needless string parsing to it.
