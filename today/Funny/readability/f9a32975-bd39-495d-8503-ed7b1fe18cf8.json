  "description": "Cats have two modes that every cat pawrent and general feline fanatic fan knows:The mysterious shadow of the night, a quiet hunter, moves in sleek movements and grace, ruling over their household with the might of an emperor and the respect they deserve, clean and tidy, regal and majestic.Fool, a goblin, running around in a zoomies fit and parkouring on the furniture, screaming on blank walls, abruptly stops to lift their leggy and lick their behinds, only to continue screaming right after because a bird dares to land on the window sill.Cats would want you to think they are constantly acting as option number 1, but if you're a practiced cat pawrent you know very well that's not true. Cats are usually option number 2, and that's just constantly funny to us, humble hoomans.Since we want to try and spread this silliness and these funny meowments everywhere, we gathered these funny cat memes. They're here to try and spread this cat silliness as far and wide in the whole world wide web.",
