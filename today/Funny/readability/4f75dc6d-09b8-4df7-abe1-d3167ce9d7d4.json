  "text": "After those first Marvel Rivals streams, where our celestial betters were allowed to frolic and play amongst the stars, I felt sorta confident not engaging with it. Every hero I saw in this hero shooter seemed to be a kind of gumbo made from the rinds and tailings of the Overwatch characters they'd mined out. I saw them pushing the kind of cart I was already sick of pushing when I was pushing carts before I quit Overwatch. And then they showed Squirrel Girl. The only bad part about the launch is the timing.  Look at this insane crap: The beta stuff looked like the Usual hot genre IP reskin, but the actual roster bangs beyond belief. There's great curation broadly - Winter Soldier is just a cool, solid lore pick, but I wouldn'ta called Jeff, Squirrel Girl, or Peni Parker. This Moon Knight looks baller supreme. You should hit up a bunch of the character intro videos on their yubtub, but only if you want to get cranked the fuck up. These takes on the characters - from the concepts, the dialogue, the animations, everything - extract every cubic centimetre of drama from these icons. It's an onslaught. After I saw Squirrel Girl and Tippy-Toe I broke down, crying aloud into the cyber-void that I no longer had any power to resist a purchase. That's when I found out it was free - that's how little I knew about it. It doesn't fuckin' look free. And it sure as shit won't be free when I buy every squirrel variant they put on the store. (CW)TB out.",
