  "description": "One driver was faced with an uncooperative car rental company, but they didn't let it get them down. Instead, they took initiative! That new rental car feeling is such a rush. You've got this fresh, clean, probably pretty new car, and it's all yours for the next few days or weeks. You get that fun feeling of driving a new car, and there's no need to worry about your messy passenger seat or those random bags you've left lying around the car. Still, after a while, you just start to want your old car back. For this person, getting their car returned wasn't so easy, and they decided to make the car rental employees pay for what they did in one of the pettiest possible ways. Still, even though this driver took the petty route, they still didn't want to make too big of a mess for the unfortunate minimum-wage workers who were going to be stuck cleaning the car. This person could've done way worse, by mucking up the inside of the car as well as the exterior, but they went easy on the dealership instead. Read about the full exchange below. Up next, read about the restaurant that got slammed with 1-star reviews after they left diners to wait for hours, then texted them with bad news.",
