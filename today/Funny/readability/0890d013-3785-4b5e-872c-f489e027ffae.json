  "text": "Williams railed against the show for allowing Ego Nwodim to poke fun at him Apparently, there’s nothing that controversial shit-starting stand-up Katt Williams hates more than a woman making fun of him — well, maybe besides women, of course.The fiery temperament belonging to the 53-years-old comedian from Cincinnati has created so many gossip-worthy moments throughout Williams’ long career in show business, but arguably no Williams scandal was nearly as meme-able as his appearance on Shannon Sharpe’s podcast and comedy beef petri dish Club Shay Shay back in January. After Williams attacked numerous comedy A-listers including Kevin Hart, Cedric the Entertainer and Steve Harvey with a slew of accusations and insults ranging from personal to professional, the writers of Saturday Night Live had no choice but to address the viral rant on the show, choosing veteran cast member Ego Nwodim to impersonate Williams in the pivotal sketch — and just like that, SNL found itself at the top of Williams’ shit list. Don't Miss During a recent talk with Page Six, Williams excoriated SNL for its mockery of him, saying that, because the show cast a woman to play him, “they think I’m a bitch.” However, if SNL really wanted to make Williams look like a “bitch,” they wouldn’t have sent out Nwodim to do an impression of him — they’d have just played that video of him sucker punching a literal child and immediately getting his ass beat. Williams’ problems with SNL go beyond its philosophy on cross-gender impressions, as he explained, “There has never been a person that has been parodied nine times on Saturday Night Live and yet never been invited other than me.” The comic then unconvincingly added, “So, I at this point, take it as a badge of honor that they don’t fuck with me.” As for Williams' specific issue with Nwodim's take on his Club Shay Shay interview, the insulted comic said, “A lot of times when people are doing an impression of you, they’re really showing you how they feel about you. You know what I mean? So, for Saturday Night Live to have an impression of me and have a woman do that, means they think I’m a bitch. And I understand that that’s what they’re saying when they do that.” Again, Williams feigned indifference to the perceived insult, claiming, “It doesn’t bother me at all. I understand how the game goes, and I understand that if you love me you know why you do. And if you don’t fuck with me, I understand why. My job is to be worthy.”Given Williams’ erratic and often violent behavior, it’s no surprise that SNL has never tapped him to host the show — and, considering how many times women have sued Williams (but never successfully) for allegedly physically attacking them, it’s also no surprise that the comic whose Wikipedia page has a “Legal Issues” section that’s longer than most SNL sketch scripts had such an irate reaction to a woman disrespecting him.Honestly, the only surprise from Williams’ freshly started beef with SNL is that Shannon Sharpe didn’t get the scoop first.
