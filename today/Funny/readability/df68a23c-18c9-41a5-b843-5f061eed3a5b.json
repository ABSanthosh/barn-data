  "description": "The entire family is giving this woman the side-eye after she did something strange during a gift exchange. Instead of getting an individual present for every member of your family, some families choose to do Secret Santa gift exchanges. It's a good way to add some fun to the typical present exchange. Everyone is assigned a family member to gift a nice present to in secret. Then, when the present is opened, the person usually finds out who gave it to them. It's a sweet tradition that allows each person to be really thoughtful about their present without breaking the bank. After all, it can be way easier to give one $50 present to one person rather than 10 or 15 individual gifts to everyone in the family. This person is being called out for acting a bit stingy. If she was having financial trouble, maybe she should've quietly talked to the Secret Santa organizer. Instead, money troubles or not, she's making a bad impression on everyone else, and commenters agreed that what she did was kind of tacky. Up next, this neighbor decided that she had an issue with one family's boat: it was in view, so she decided it had to be moved ASAP.",
