  "description": "Being a cat momma is a hard job, that is a fact. Think of how hard it is to raise one human at a time and then think about how cat mommas have to raise whole litters of babies at once. It's rough. There is a lot that you have to teach your kittens. You have to teach kittens how to drink from a bowl without getting water up their noses, for example. You have to teach kittens how to communicate with their future humans so that they can give us the orders that we're supposed to follow. Really, it's not surprising that some cat mommas get overwhelmed sometimes. And it's even less surprising that some cat mommas ask humans to help… to babysit. They need a break every once in a while too. And for you, the human that was chosen to babysit, that is a very big and impurrtant responsibility that they are bestowing upon you. So, you have to take it seriously, just like the person in today's story did.",

We are glad to see that this person is taking it for the compliment that it is. And that they are taking their responsibility as cat babysitter very seriously.  We're happy to hear that so many of them are thriving and are in homes now. We understand that you could not take them all in, but it sounds like you are taking very good care of them nonetheless. And clearly, this momma is very thankful to you.",
