  "description": "If you could change just one thing about your local hospital or doctor's office, what would it be? Many people would immediately know the answer: shorter wait times! No one wants to spend long hours in the waiting room while they're feeling their worst (not to mention having to hang out with a bunch of other people who are coughing or sneezing). Other people would suggest better hospital food, or a quieter room without beeping or having to deal with a roommate behind a curtain. There are plenty of helpful suggestions one could make, and below are the funniest, least helpful suggestions out there. It all started when the NHS (National Health Service) of England put out an open call for suggestions to make their service better. They did this via an online anonymous suggestion site, and we all know the internet cannot take anything seriously. People had hilarious suggestions, like banning apples since they keep doctors away, or turning down the heating by a single degree. You can check out some of the funniest examples compiled by @llwtydeer and other X users down below. Up next, have a laugh at these staircases that are going to make a few people go airborne, like one person who noticed that a flight of stairs \"aren't attached to the ground.\"",
