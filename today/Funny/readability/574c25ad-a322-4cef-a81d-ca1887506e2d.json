  "description": "We're not going to lie to you, feline fam, we have often dreamed of mysteriously waking up one day in the body of a cat. Just leaving behind our jobs, our friends, even ice cream, all to be a lazy house cat purrfectly perturbed by our inept hoomans. However, that dream has stayed a dream because we know it's not physically pawssible (yet). However, there are others that take it one step further by pretending to be a cat…online. Now, we must be clear that this story is 100% fiction, but we're sure there are people who do this for real. The poster (wife) wrote an absolutely hissterical fan-fiction post about her husband pretending to be a cat online for three years. But, that's not even the best part. The commenters somehow seemed to miss the fact that it was not real, and their reactions are purrfectly serious. It's a giant trainwreck of a post, but it's one we can't look away from in all the funniest ways. Soak up all the silliness below!",
