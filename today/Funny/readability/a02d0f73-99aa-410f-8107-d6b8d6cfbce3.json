  "description": "CATS ARE THE SILLIEST CREATURES. They blep and mlem constantly, while their face is stuck in a silly expression, staring out to the vastness of space and time. Cats get scared of thin air, jumping in a panic from seemingly nothing. And finally, cats get the zoomies, which is arguably the silliest instinct a domesticated princess can have.CATS ARE THE SMARTEST CREATURES. They always know what time it is right now, and their strict schedule actually helps us, humble hoomans, to keep track of our lives. Cats are fiercely independent and can take care of themselves. It's not that they don't love us, but they are definitely sharp and capable. And finally, they know their family - other hoomans and animals of the house - and they're very smart to know that they are part of something.CAT MEMES ARE THE SILLIEST SMARTEST MEMES. And this is why we love to celebrate cats' silliness and smartness with a big bunch of silly and smart cat memes. We love cats. We love how silly they are. We love how smart they are. We love cat memes.",
