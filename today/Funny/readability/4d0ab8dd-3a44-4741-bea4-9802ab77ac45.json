  "description": "When it comes to cats and family… there are always challenges. Hey, the Cat Distribution System only provides the cat to one human usually, so the rest of the humans in the house simply have to deal with it. Now, you always want things to end up well. And we have seen so many times dads who hated cats falling in love with them and moms who didn't like cats suddenly having a soft spot for them once the adopted kitty shows them affection. Usually, it's just a matter of time. Usually, when there is respect toward the cat and a desire for the cat to accept you, if you wait long enough, the kitty will warm up to you. But not here. Not in today's story. In this case, there was no respect for the kitty, no understanding, and seemingly, no desire for love from the kitty. And although usually, we want to give people the benefit of the doubt, this sister is not getting it from us this time.",
