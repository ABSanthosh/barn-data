  "description": "When you put your neck out for your supervisor, you kinda expect to form a good professional relationship with them, right? Like, if you are literally one minute late, then they won't make a big deal about it. As long as you're doing what you were hired to do, well, and with no complaints, then what is one minute? Well, apparently some supervisors use that one minute as a way to make themselves look better—and it doesn't matter how buddy buddy you've gotten with them. Why would you ever cover for a supervisor who throws you under the bus after literally one minute? Well, that's exactly what happened to this employee. His supervisor would sometimes not even show up for an entire shift, but he didn't mind. He would just stay longer and have her back. However, one day, after covering her closing shift, he should up ONE minute late to work. That's right. Not an hour late, not even 10 minutes late, just one minute. And instead of her even approaching him to ask what's up or talk to him about anything, she marched right to HR and reported him. So he got written up for being one minute late…. ONE MINUTE.",
