  "description": "There are some bosses in the working world who seem addicted to firing people for no apparent reason. The only ways you can learn about these types of individuals in advance is if you ask why the current position to which you are applying is vacant. The answer to that question often can provide a clue as to what kind of an employer you might be dealing with should you fill the position.This employee dealt with a supervisor who had a problem with extended bathroom breaks and exaggerated his new hire's so-called \"30-minute\" break just so he could justify firing him. Check out the full story below!",

  "text": "This employee had recently begun working at a staffing agency, but his time there came to an end pretty soon after a month-long training process. During one of his early shifts, he had gone to the bathroom and had to wait for an extended period of time due to a long line and a shortage of stalls.When he returned to work, he found out that he had been completely clocked out and fired because he was apparently gone for 30 minutes…The now-former employee maintains that he was not gone for half an hour and that this was an exaggeration made by another employee who clearly had a problem with him. The employee was also reprimanded for not notifying his direct supervisor prior to going to the bathroom, but that supervisor was not available to be notified at all. Sounds like an excuse to justify firing this guy for no real legitimate reason. Keep scrolling below to see what members in the online community had to say about this mess!",
