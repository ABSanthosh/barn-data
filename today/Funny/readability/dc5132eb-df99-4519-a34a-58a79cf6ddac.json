  "description": "There's a lot of the wildest sort of behavior going on with this wedding, and it's hard to believe that anyone walks away from this looking very good…Forcing the things you like upon other people will be met with varied success. But, then and again, it is your day, and you should have it pretty much exactly how you want it. But, even still, you have made somewhat of an obligation to properly feed the people who have gathered together to celebrate you (though there will be wildly different opinions of what \"properly\" is), and there's nothing worse than being left hungry at a wedding due to a lack of food.Still, regardless of how you might feel about the host's choice of food, you can imagine it would be wildly inappropriate to go ahead and usurp the proceedings at a wedding by rolling 20 meaty pizzas through the door of your vegan cousin's wedding before dinner is even properly served.",
