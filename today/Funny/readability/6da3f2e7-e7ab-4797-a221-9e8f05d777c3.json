  "description": "Why has the conversation about wages and pay rates become such a taboo topic? What is it about money that gets people so sensitive, or even offended, that it became impossible to talk about?When it comes to people's private lives, we get it. People don't want to disclose how much they make, or what their financial status is, and that's fair. But when it comes to the workplace, or at the very least, during a hiring process, we don't understand why it has become almost a rule to avoid talking about money.A job posting's most important detail is the pay; it is as simple as that. There is no reason why hiring managers should waste time, both their own and job candidates, by going through a hiring process without first discussing the wage expectations. If it's not a good fit, it is simply pointless, and all the politics around the \"negotiation\" are just a waste of time.That is why the hiring manager in the story below needs a serious wake-up call. Keep scrolling to understand why.",
