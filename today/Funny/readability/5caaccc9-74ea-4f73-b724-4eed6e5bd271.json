  "description": "If you work irregular hours week to week, then you know how annoying it is to race to find shift coverage if you have plans on a day you had hoped you'd be free. This scheduling process makes it nearly impossible to have a life outside of work and leaves you allergic to future planning. We all want to get our shifts covered when needed, but it's not cool to repeatedly pressure another colleague into taking your shift because you have plans—they can have plans, too.A perfect world would consist of everyone having all the time they need for the things they want to do, but we're not in a utopia—we are in reality! So, your best bet is to ask around your entire team to see if anyone is willing to tie up your loose ends.In this next story, an employee's coworker assumes that the employee will cover their shift without receiving a definitive yes, and goes over their head to their boss on the morning of the shift.
