We love everyone’s wonderful families so much, but unfortunately, our Disney wedding just isn’t able to accommodate children.” According to witnesses, the mother of the bride, dressed as Cruella, and the groomsmen, dressed as the Seven Dwarfs, then began distributing complimentary mouse ears that the fully adult guests—each person at a minimum two decades older than the Disney entertainment’s intended viewership—were required to wear during the Aladdin-themed vows.
