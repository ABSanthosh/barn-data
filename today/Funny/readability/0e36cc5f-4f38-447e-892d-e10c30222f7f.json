  "description": "It's remarkable how much nonsense people think they can get away with in the name of the phrase, \"but it's my wedding!\"Here's the deal. Weddings are, of course, a special day for the happy couple, and they deserve to make certain choices based on what they want for their presumably only wedding (though the statistics say otherwise). However, you do have to keep the experience of your guests in mind. I remember a few years ago attending a wedding in which, at one point, one half of the married couple deeply considered not serving anyone food because he didn't want to pay for it. Thankfully, he was talked into giving his guests a little something, but it just goes to show that while you are entitled to make decisions that are specific to your desires, you still have to be a decent host. After all, people are traveling, spending money on air fare, organizing babysitters, and more in order to show up to your special day. You have to make it at least somewhat special for them too!",
