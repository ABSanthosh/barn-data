  "description": "We've probably been slightly annoyed at some point when a neighbor parks in front of our house, especially when it's a dodgy-looking vehicle that we've never seen before, and especially when we're awoken by a noisy exhaust and slamming doors at odd hours in the morning. I'll be honest: In this situation I've been known to do my best \"Mrs. Kravitz\" impression, craning my head through the gap in the curtains and straining to see who is parking outside my house at 2 AM.The poster here seems to go back and forth as to what the issue is, he starts off mentioning that his wife was texted by the neighbor about the trailer, yet he seems to be focused on the truck being the issue. It would make much more sense if it was the trailer or the combined pairing of the two that was the issue. Whatever the issue, sounds like Jill needs to chill.",

  "text": "While the neighbor's actions are extreme they're at least somewhat understandable—at least I think… or am I just aging into an entitled ornery neighbor myself?Parking an unsightly trailer on the street in front of your neighbor's house, while not the end of the world, isn't exactly neighborly. I've been in that exact situation and did everything in my power to back into my own driveway or block my own driveway when not in use in order to not be a nuisance. Especially if his wife isn't even home I don't understand why he wouldn't just be doing this in the first place. Still, the neighbor is definitely overreacting and, at that point, all bets are off.",
