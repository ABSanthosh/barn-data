  "description": "Hoomans are faced with meowments of pure clarity in their lives where the 'right thing' becomes incredibly obvious. For the lonely trucker in this next story, a desperate cat in need prompted him to become the hero he was always meant to be, saving a kitty's life and tackling some terrifying truck stop foes in the process. North America is full of furry mammals in the wild that are both big enough and strong enough to take out a human—such as bears, wolves, coyotes, and moose, to name a few. The smaller critters in the wild have learned to defend themselves from becoming prey to these sharp-toothed beasts, but the graceful, mischievous, and oh-so-curious house cat was never born with these instincts. In fact, house cats are defenseless out in the wild and have no natural defense skills apart from a warrior-cry hiss and an arsenal of mean-beans that have never been used for battle. Stray cats are far more vulnerable than they lead on and sometimes a good-hearted hooman needs to step up to rescue them. Keep scrolling to read the story of a cat's unlikely survival in the face of a pack of coyotes after a trucker at a truck stop swooped in to save her.",
