  "description": "There are employees who fly under the radar, quiet, competent, the workplace equivalent of background music: they don't distract or disrupt, they just get the job done. There are the eager workers, the ones whose productivity is as loud and overbearing as their motivational mug collection. And, of course, you can't forget (you probably can actually) the office ghost, the one no one has actually seen working, but everyone hopes will haunt someone else's shift soon.But then, towering above all workplace stereotypes like a monument sculpted entirely from apathy, is a legendary specimen who manages to exist at the intersection of invisibility and visible dust. This is the coworker who specializes in underachieving with such consistency, it's almost an achievement. Some coworkers quietly do something, this one does nothing loudly.",
