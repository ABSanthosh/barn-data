  "description": "Howdy, purrtners. We don't know about you all, but by the time we get to Sunday, we're beat. From working our paws off all week to meeting with friends, chores, errands, family, and more on the weekends, we want nothing more than to curl up on the couch and be a potato all day. However, we only have two days of free time, so we don't want to waste it by doing nothing all day. Pawrt of the day is fine, though.So, while we relax in bed while gathering our will to get up, we might as well scroll through something that we know will make us smile and put us in a pawsitive mewd! That thing is cat memes, and not just any cat memes…all-pawerful cat memes! These feline funnies are sure to recharge your Sunday with the energy of 1,000 tiny forehead kisses. It works for our cute kitties, so it will probably work for us as well. We wish you a very relaxing, yet prrroductive rest of your weekend. Enjoy!",
