  "text": "This morning Victor came out of the house to stare at me because I was standing on a chair with my head in the trees and he just sighed a little so I explained that I was just painting the trees for Halloween and then he sighed louder. But then I explained that I’d noticed that our oak trees were filled with thousands of little orange balls and so I was painting jack-o-lantern faces on them so that when people walked by they would see hundreds of tiny little halloween pumpkins, as if a witch had cast a spell over our whole yard. Then Victor was like, “But aren’t those food?” and I suddenly panicked that I had accidentally poisoned all the squirrels, so I used google lens to take a picture of two of them to try to identify them and google lens was like, “Nope. No results. Not falling for this bullshit again” and then I realized it was probably because I’d just uploaded a picture of two fuzz-covered, peach-colored balls and probably google didn’t want to be like, “YOU WANT SCROTUMS?” so I added “in my oak tree” to the search and google lens was like, “Phew. Okay, girl. I thought you were trying to get me in trouble. Those are just oak wasp galls.” Which was not a relief to me because…what? Apparently oak ball wasps lay eggs in the leaves of oak trees that develop into these parasitic balls and inside each one is a baby wasp just waiting to be born, which is the most heavy-metal thing I’ve heard all day. And so now I’m conflicted because if people see these and rip them down to take home then they might wake up the next morning with (admittedly not-very-aggressive and kind of adorable) baby wasps crawling out of them like a gentle but terrible curse, but also, that is exactly the kind of shit you should expect if you’re stealing magical balls from witches gardens and I do like the halloween authenticity of it. Some of you have not read your fairy tales and it shows. Also, today is World Mental Health Day and so I should be writing about my books and asking you to buy them but instead I’m painting trees and writing about tree scrotum and this is exactly why I’m terrible at marketing, but also a pretty good indication that I know what I’m talking about when it comes to mental health issues. It’s also a good indication that I am close to being finished with my next book because that late-stage fear of “will people like it?” is ramping up to the point that my brain is like, “YES, I REALIZE I NEED TO CONFRONT THE FEAR OF WRITING BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST…THESE TREES NEED TO BE PAINTED.” But now I am back at my desk, fingers covered in ink stains and ready to write. I hope you’re ready to read. More soon. Post navigation",
