  "description": "Go on, leave that terrible job: this is your sign! Every employee has a different tolerance level for the shenanigans they'll put up with from their bosses. (It also depends on how wealthy the person is, naturally.) Some thick-skinned employees are able to stay for years at jobs where their boss is just awful towards them. They can handle the most toxic environments and the most irritating coworkers as long as the pay is right. Other employees will leave at the first hint of discomfort, though, and neither of these workers is necessarily wrong. Leaving your job almost always guarantees you a cushier salary and a boost to your resume. But then again, leaving the familiar is easier said than done… What if you dislike your current job, leave it, and then utterly despise the new gig? There's no guarantee that you'll find it more enjoyable than before. It's just up to chance. If you ever get the chance to quit en masse with your coworkers, though, I know it'd be tempting. The thought of leaving your least favorite manager to handle grouchy clients or belligerent customers is a sweet daydream. Why not make it come true?Up next, read the petty text messages between a landlord and a tenant who just wanted to let someone park for a single day, with irate commenters telling them to \"leave a scathing review.\"",
