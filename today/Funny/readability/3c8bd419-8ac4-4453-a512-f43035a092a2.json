  "description": "The folks you're about to read about were not the A+ students of their classes. Not every student can be the best in their class. Most are going to be somewhere in the middle, and some are going to be at the bottom of the grade book. Professors expect this, and many of them aren't discouraged by seemingly dumb questions. After all, the question that's silly to one student might be really educational to another student. It doesn't hurt to ask! Still, there are some questions that leave you wondering how these students ever graduated high school in the first place. One student openly admitted to cheating, out loud, in class, in front of the professor. She flippantly said that she had copied from a book to pad out her paper, leaving the whole class stunned. Another person was found to have plagiarised a paper. Funny enough, that paper was just an introduction about themself! Why in the world would you need to plagiarise information about yourself? Check out all of these ridiculous college questions below, thanks to one person's r/AskReddit query: \"College students, what is the dumbest thing you've heard a fellow student say?\"Up next, find out why \"an entire group of bridesmaids left a wedding\" while acting on a dare.",
