  "description": "If you're struggling to land a new job, just consider: it could be going so much worse for you! No one ever said it'd be easy to get hired for a new job. Even when you're trying your very hardest, you might just not be the employee that the hiring manager is looking for. You may have to apply to hundreds of jobs before getting an interview, so then the pressure to perform well is on. When that interview arrives, you want to be at your very best. Lots of people will research the company, practice all the typical interview questions, and dress to the nines to try and score that job. While you're job hunting, take a look at some of the folks below who are most certainly not succeeding in their own job search. Maybe it'll make you feel better to laugh at other's misfortune! Plus, it's a nice guide on exactly what not to do: just look at some of the crazy messages people have sent to hiring managers and recruiters! After that, read about this act of mass malicious compliance done by about 60 workers who all decided to get back at their boss, embarrassing him in front of the company's CEO!",
