  "description": "City living is a different beast than other kinds of living; the high-density population leads to close proximity to other people at pretty much all times. Also, offering the unique opportunity to live in an apartment directly above a business like you're in some sort of 90s sitcom.While living in a sitcom sounds nice, the fact remains that in this type of living situation, even in your own bed, you're only really a few feet away from another person, either next to, above, or below you—separated by an often paper-thin wall. For those among us who hate being perceived, this is a verifiable nightmare… and there's no getting past it. You pretty much have to just get used to the fact that it's impossible that you won't make noises in your own home that other people can hear, and similarly get used to the noisy parts of other people's lives too.Of course, as with anything in this life, people take things way too far on either side of the spectrum—some making too big of a deal about a little noise or simply making way too much of it at inconsiderate and inconvenient times. This neighbor, renting the business space below this family's apartment, somehow managed to do both, freaking out about the noise that their toddler made while also making way too much noise himself at odd hours. After the neighbor continuously violated the terms of his lease, the husband and father of the family had had enough and sent evidence of the neighbor's behavior to their landlord, getting him evicted and putting an effective end to his business.",
