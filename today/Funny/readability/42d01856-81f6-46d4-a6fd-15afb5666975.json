  "description": "Anyone who has worked in a customer-facing role has had to learn how to navigate working with a difficult personality. According to this drive-thru employee, Susan was no exception. She was the kind of entitled customer who liked to throw tantrums if someone got her order wrong or even made the slightest, negligible error. However, this employee managed to be one of the chosen few to get in her good graces. This made for an easier experience for everyone on staff whenever she came by to order, but it also paid off for the employee down the road when he was struggling to stand up to the new general manager of the location. This newbie, Jack, had a habit of enforcing pointless policies just so that he could flex his muscles and reinforce his authority. For instance, he once pulled the whole staff aside during a shift to inform them that they weren't smiling enough. You know, that kind of guy. But what happens when these kinds of managers have to deal with those kinds of entitled customers?",
