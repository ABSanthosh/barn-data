  "description": "Offices are not unlike the Wild Wild West. While it may seem like a fresh frontier of opportunity, where you can be a cubicle outlaw, riding a steed of Excel sheets, and dueling with your saloon rival on your lunch break, several rules must be abided by, or else the sanctity of order falls apart. For starters, replying to an email 30 seconds after receiving it is a big 'no-no' unless it's a specifically urgent matter. That person just checked this task off their To-Do list; there's no need to pile it right back onto the top. Other rules of the office are more nuanced. For example, you can't microwave fish in the communal space, you have to admire pictures of your fellow coworkers' children (when prompted), and you certainly can't finish the break room coffee without making a new pot. These are the laws of the office outlaws, and they must be abided... Or else.",
