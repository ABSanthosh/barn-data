  "description": "The dreaded job search is not for the faint of heart. The job market in the last few years has stolen a sliver of all of our hearts because of how daunting and draining the process is. Oh, you went to college? Well, you don't have six years of experience for this entry-level role, get lost! Oh, you want to be paid a liveable wage? Too bad—we have another desperate prospective employee who would do the job for half the pay. Don't get me started on interviewer-hazing tactics… It's like some companies get off on the fear they instill into capable, skillful, and hardworking individuals.Even when the resume, the education, and the work experience check out, you still gotta be wary of the company that decides to hire you. Though a job is a job and you probably need some way to pay the bills, you have to also think about your mental and if you'll want to quit after your first week. You might see these red flags in the interview, but it's something to continuously be aware of… If you're on the job hunt and need a little pick-me-up after a long day on Indeed and LinkedIn, scroll below. Nothing does the trick like laughing at our pain.",

In a “grindset\" culture where we're expected to work day, night, on the weekends, during church, in the shower—why can't humans desire to do nothing? Surely, it makes sense. Big Corporate has their hands in our backs like puppeteers and tells us we should want to hop in the cubicle and eat microwaved lunch every day. Is there more to life than that? Sure! But living life isn't possible with a job! So, instead of getting philosophical, we laugh at memes instead!",
