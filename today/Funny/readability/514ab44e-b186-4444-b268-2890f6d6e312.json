I would play it more, just install it myself, but I feel very strongly that you need a witness to extract the most out of it. I think there's too much texture, too much detail for a single person and I am prepared to sign up for either side of the dyad. It's also updated the genre itself - something like an immersive sim, immy simmy perhaps, with some creature comforts for players that jettison some of the drudgery we associate with this sort of game. Uncharted is Indiana Jones too essentially, a pulp extravaganza, but it's happy to do that inside of cinematic platforming and Gears lite gunplay - inside the mainstream verbs. Indy wants you to… This fucking game, man. This game wants to alchemically transform you into literal Indiana Jones inside of what might as well be real places. That's the only thing they care about. That was on the board when they were brainstorming IJatGC, right at the top, and then they didn't write anything else. That means it has dynamics: it has to blend loud and quiet because vast portions of its cinematic inheritance trades on the same themes. It's quiets are more quiet and its louds are more loud precisely because they are constantly orbiting each other. A heartfelt script and an unbelievable soundtrack might not even be necessary the other parts are so good. Now I see why everybody else wouldn't shut up about it. Am I about to become one of those people?! In today's 10-2 #Fridabe stream, we're absolutely gonna start with some Rivals. But at Noon? It couldnt definitely be more Indy. One of the devs for Turbo Dismount 2 just gave me a key for - you guessed it - Turbo Dismount 2 of all things. We'll have to take the temp of the channel and figure out which way to go. (CW)TB out.",
