  "description": "To us, as people who love big cats so, so much, it's hard to ever imagine someone treating them badly. Lion cubs are so adorable and precious. They may grow up to be fierce, meowjestic and powerful, but as cubs, lions are vulnerable and need help. In fact, we don't know if there is anything more vulnerable than a solitary lion cub. And unfortunately, there are some people out there who use that fact for their own gain. This sweet lion cub was being passed around between human to human, as they tried to sell it while hiding it from authorities. There was no care to the lion cub's well-being whatsoever. It was lucky that the cub was rescued as early as it was - before the damage done to it was irreversible. Being rescued gave the cub a second chance at an actual life, and he took that chance with all four of his paws and is living an absolutely fabulous life in a sanctuary in Africa right now.   Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.
