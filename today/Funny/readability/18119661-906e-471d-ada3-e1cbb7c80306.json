  "description": "Tech support is a wonderful service for technologically illiterate people. However, this customer got awfully condescending with his valiant over-the-phone hero after getting saved from moronic assumptions. Usually, when someone's there to help you, it's ill-advised to talk down to them. It's an unpopular opinion with all of the Karens and the Kevins out there, but in my mind, a customer service representative wants to get you off the phone with your ticket item concluded and solved faster than you do. And when the expert on the other line is asking probing questions about your technology, they can only assume you at least sort of know what you're talking about—unlike the Boomer in this next story. Caught between the cross-hairs of entitlement and uselessness, this Kevin was unable to identify the difference between an iPad and a laptop, yet blamed his tech support guy for his own shortcomings. Read on for the details of this uncomfortable customer service encounter where a guy makes a fool of himself and has no other way to reset his pride than by leaving a scathing review of his IT guy.",
