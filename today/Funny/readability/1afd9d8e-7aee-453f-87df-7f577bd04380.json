  "description": "We're at that awkward middle of the week period. Not close enough to the weekend to relax, but far enough from Monday that you're starting to feel semi-human again. It's a weird, wobbly kind of day - which is exactly why we've summoned the derpiest cats the internet has to offer to keep your meowmentum going strong.These feline friends have absolutely zero idea what they're doing… and we love them for it. From cross-eyed loafs attempting quantum mechanics, to dramatic mid-yawn masterpieces, to floofy friends who somehow managed to get their entire head stuck in a snack bag - every one of these kitties is bringing their best mid-week nonsense.Fluff. Chaos. Drama! Our weekly cat newsletter has it all - subscribe here.",

  "text": "Sometimes, you don't need deep wisdom or motivation. You just need a wall-eyed tabby doing a backflip off the sofa for no reason whatsoever. And that's what cat memes are for.So if you're feeling a little off your game today, don't worry - you're in purrfect company. Scroll through these derpy feline delights and let their glorious weirdness carry you through the rest of the week like a majestic, meowing wave of joy. There's no disciplining the cat. Every cat pawrent who has had a cat for more than two seconds knows this. The discipline comes from the cat to the human, not the other way around. Who else? Who else? Aren't everybody all meowing back to their cats? Isn't it part of being a cat pawrent? Don't we all suppose to meow back at our cats at every opportunity?",
