  "description": "Caturday is over, Monday is looming in front of us, but we have to stay pawsitive. We have to remind ourselves that the weekend is not yet over. There is still time left to see all the hilarious cat memes that you missed. Sunday, as far as we are concerned, is just another extension to Caturday. And really, any day can be Caturday if you just try hard enough. So, just as we start Caturdays with feline funnies, so will we start this Sunday, because it's just the right thing to do. So, take a minute. Forget all the things that you were worrying about a second before. While you are here, on ICHC, you must be focused on the silly cat memes. All it takes to forget your worries is a few minutes of investing in yourself, which is exactly what you are about to do right now. The rest can wait. Right now, the next five minutes are all about loving yourself and doing something that is good for your soul.",

You caught this way before the first has happened. The number of times we have caught our cat munching on some thawing chicken… had us calling the vet to make sure that it's not dangerous to them. Yeah… it happened more than once. Took us a minute to learn the lesson.",
