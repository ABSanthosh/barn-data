  "description": "What's the point of a vacation if you have to keep an eye on your phone the whole time? If you're anxiously awaiting a call from your boss at any minute, you're not exactly getting much time to relax and unwind. Disconnecting from work is so important, but a lot of managers view vacation time as some optional luxury. They seem to take it personally when their employees request time off, as if that employee is taking money from their pockets. Even though it's just their job to manage people, they get upset when someone needs a break because they'll have to work a bit extra. This person just wanted to take a brief vacation with their wife, and they even booked a nice trip to get away from it all. However, their boss had other plans for them. At least this employee pushed back when their boss told them that he'd need to contact them during the trip. It's infuriating when your boss calls or texts you when you're off the clock… and some managers, like this dude, think that being a salaried employee means you're available 24/7. You can't buy all of an employee's time! Next, read about the mildly infuriating things that toddlers are doing, like one parent who lamented that they \"Made bagels… my toddler took a single bite out of each one.\"",
