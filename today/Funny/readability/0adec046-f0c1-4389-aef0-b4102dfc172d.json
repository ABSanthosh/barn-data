  "description": "Listen up, feline fam! Your health is impawtant to us. If you don't eat well and exercise regularly, who is going to take care of your cats? We would, but we're already maxed out at six. One of the most crucial parts of staying healthy is a balanced diet with lots of fiber. And what, dear readers, is one of the best sources of fiber there is? Beans! Yes, the magical fruit (that isn't actually a fruit at all, but does, in fact, make you toot). Now, it wouldn't be I Can Has Cheezburger if we didn't add a feline twist to this recommendation, so we've got an extra serving of beans from some purrfect paws of polydactyl cats.As if cats' paws couldn't get any cuter, here you go. Not only are they fluffy, soft, and adorable, but now they come with extra beans and more floof to boot? We're sold. If this is all it takes to stay healthy, consider us the next Jane Fonda. We hope you enjoy these kitty cuties, and stay fibrous!",
