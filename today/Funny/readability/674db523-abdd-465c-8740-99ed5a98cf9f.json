  "description": "Food and cats is a love story that's as old as time. Well, maybe not as time, but at least as old as cats. But even then, way back when there were no domesticated fluffy felines in existence, we can say that cats love story with food started as early as a hooman handed a piece of food to a feline. Our dear domesticated fluffy friends just love food, and it's quite apparent.If you're a cat pawrent, you know what we're talking about. Cats will monch on anything, but they will also not be satisfied if the food is not exactly to their taste. Cats produce chonkers which are absolute units because cats love food so much. If you're not just a cat pawrent, but a cat pawrent of a true chonker, you probably deal with it all the time.These foodie feline memes below capture the cattitude towards food, and simply the unbroken connection between our fluffy feline friends and fresh food.",
