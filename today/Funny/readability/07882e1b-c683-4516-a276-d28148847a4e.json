  "description": "The terms of relationships aren't drawn out on a piece of paper—well, there are marriage licenses, but they're unique in that fact. Even still, signing your names and such on a little piece of paper, while legally significant, does little else to define the relationship outside of the nature of the commitment.Relationships need to bloom and blossom naturally, you can't just command them to be so. They're formed through shared experiences of both joy and hardship, forging a bond that cannot be broken.It's always hard bringing two different groups of people together, there's a reason there are so many memes and jokes about how much it makes you sweat to introduce two different friend groups to each other. And with families, of course, this is even far more extreme with it being a much more intimate and close knit type of relationship.",
