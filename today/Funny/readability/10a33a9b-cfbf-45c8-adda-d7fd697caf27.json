  "description": "Hi there, feline fam. There are a few situations where we would consider it \"appropriate\" for a pet cat to be outside. The first would be if the cat had an epically enormous cat-shaped cat house that their owner built them. The second, and similarly, would be if your cat had a closed patio, which they could spend time outside without fear of escaping. The third would be if you have harness-trained your cats and take them on walks outside. That's it. Especially in months with harsh weather, like now where it's pawsitively sweltering outside.All of this to say that we get where this neighbor is coming from in the post below. They felt their neighbor's cat choose them after being left to survive outside, and now they're wondering what they should do. They're moving, and they don't want to abandon the cat that clearly feels safe with them, but the cat still isn't \"theirs\" to begin with. What would you do?Fluff. Chaos. Drama! Our weekly cat newsletter has it all -  subscribe here.",
