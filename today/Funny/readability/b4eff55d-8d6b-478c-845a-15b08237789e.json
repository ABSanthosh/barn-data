  "description": "You never know when you'll be down on your luck. That's why it's important to treat everyone with the respect they deserve, regardless of their economic and living situations. What truly matters is the kind of person you are, and those who have beauty within will always win. To be rich in spirit and kindness and spread that good energy around, regardless of what your situation might be, is something special.Then, there are those people who want to make everyone else miserable with their snap judgments. The Karen in this story was strolling through the park when she noticed a homeless man (who the original poster (OP) states is adored by the community) and began to berate him. She claims that he has no right to be in the park, despite his very kind and unbothersome nature. Shouts of \"get a job\" and \"stop being so lazy\" exit her mouth, and then she calls the authorities. When they arrive, it turns out they know the homeless man very well and ask him how he's doing. Instead of believing Karen's false accusations, they proceed to tell her if she doesn't stop causing a disturbance, she will be the one removed from the park. Once she stomps away, the entire community shows up for the homeless man, Tim in a heartwarming turn of events.",
