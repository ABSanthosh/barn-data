  "description": "It's that time of year once again! It's time to dress up for Halloween, carve some pumpkins, eat some pumpkin pie, pick some apples, and rake the leaves off your lawn. The weather is cooling down while we're heating up a mug of apple cider. For many people, autumn is a perfect time of year: not too hot nor too cold, and full of fun activities for the whole family. However, these people have had a few mildly infuriating things happen to them. One all-too-common gripe was people carving pumpkins, placing them on their front porch, and later discovering they'd been destroyed. Squirrels, deer, and other wildlife just cannot resist munching on jack-o-lanterns. It's a tasty treat for them, and they don't understand that they're ruining your Halloween decorations. Other people realized they're living with a bunch of hooligans upon finding some pumpkin pies that were eaten really bizarrely. You'll have to keep scrolling down to see what I mean (and find out a bunch of ways to never eat a pumpkin pie). Up next, this college student simply cannot understand why his professor won't answer the door during his office hours… except the student keeps showing up at 5 in the morning, or on weekends!",
