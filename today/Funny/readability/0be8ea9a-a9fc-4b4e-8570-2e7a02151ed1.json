  "description": "We all know those beautiful and moving videos of parents surprising their step-children with adoption papers, as they become their official parents for life. Creating this combined family should be a wonderful and exciting thing that every single member of the family wants. This means that you cannot force it to happen–it must happen naturally, with the approval of both the children and the parents.If you try to force the unification of two families, you should not be surprised if you are met with pushback, especially with young children. When kids are forced to accept a new parent to their family, without giving them a chance to properly say goodbye to the parent they lost, or without the chance to connect to the new addition–it is simply not going to work. Not only will it cause them to push back on the new parent, but it will also drive them away from the existing one, and if you don't believe me, the next story will surely prove my point.",

That might have been accepted by the kids if they were not immediately forced to accept this woman as their new mother. This woman had children on her own, and before they knew it, all 7 kids were being pushed to become this new happy family, and not all of them were ready for this kind of change.If that isn't enough, the dad and his new wife decided to adopt each other's children, even though some of the kids, on both sides, refused to go along with the adoption. This led to a huge rift – both between the parents and the children, and between the siblings themselves.
