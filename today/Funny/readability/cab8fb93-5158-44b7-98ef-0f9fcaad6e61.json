  "description": "Part of the responsibility of setting rules is that you have to follow them. It is inconvenient, to be sure, but all you really need to do to avoid that inconvenience is make sure that you're setting fair rules that everyone, including yourself, should be following for the betterment of everyone affected. Everyone despises their HOA, but undoubtedly, rules like this are important when it comes to the fair enjoyment of your own space. No one likes to hear unnecessary noise from a neighbor.It's just especially ironic that this neighbor also happened to be one of only three board members for the complex… holding ⅓ of the power for the entire HOA, and he still couldn't follow the rules. Not to mention, he clearly intends to rent his unit out, which will mean an even more uncontrolled amount of noise for this downstairs neighbor.The downstairs neighbor shared their experience with this online community, wondering if they were in the wrong for reporting the breaches their upstairs neighbor, who was on the HOA board, had committed.",
