  "description": "Anybody who has ever owned a special-needs cat knows how big of a responsibility it is. These cats need extra from you. That's true and has always been true. So that is something that has to go into consideration when you adopt a special-needs cat. At first glance, it looks like the man in this story did realize this - the weight of the responsibility of having a cat like this. It seems that he looked for a cat-sitter who specializes in cats who need this little bit extra. But then things take a turn. A weird turn. This man, who is clearly well-off financially, seems to have had a problem with paying the $20 that this highly qualified cat sitter was asking for, a price that any cat owner, let alone a special-needs cat owner, should be willing to pay for something like this. He put off paying until the last second, and when the cat sitter put her foot down, he did the most unexpected thing of all.  Fluff. Chaos. Drama!
