  "description": "I recorded another timelapse of the comic creation and this time I remembered to turn it on before I started! Here’s a look at today’s comic strip from start to finish. Again, if you set the play back speed to 0.25 you approach something like real time but it’s important to note that it only records when I make a stroke so you don’t have all my pauses. While I’m drawing I’m also watching a show, pausing to think about what I’m gonna draw, talking with my kids as they come in and out, messing up and getting mad at myself, eating some lunch, and all that good stuff. This might make it look like I sit down and power through a comic without hesitation and with supreme confidence but I assure you that is not the case unless I am drawing live on stage at PAX.",
