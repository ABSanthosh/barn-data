  "description": "There's no wrong time to visit your favorite amusement park… right? Wrong! There are in fact some times that are less than ideal to visit a fun destination, but not everyone agrees on when it becomes an issue. Just ask one person who was upset that their vacation to Disney was being stifled by some inclement weather. Disney vacations are not cheap, and some families save for years or go into debt in order to visit. It's a magical trip that parents love doing with their kids. Imagine you save up for years, take time off work, get your kids packed up and ready to go to the airport, and then you're told you can't actually visit after all this time. You'd probably be really upset! There's no way around it: it's a bad situation. However, there's definitely a time and place to complain about these things. As commenters swiftly pointed out, choosing to complain during a hurricane that's sure to devastate some Florida communities is not the time to address your own amusement park gripes. This person wondered if the hurricane only reached Category One (the weakest category), would they still be able to go? But due to their attitude towards the whole situation, Redditors quickly downvoted this person, and gave them a stern talking to as well. I'm sure this person was expecting sympathy, but they got very little of that! Up next, this hotel front desk worker spent a while searching for a mysterious food smell for one visitor, adding that \"I look forward to seeing if she 'reports' me.\"",
