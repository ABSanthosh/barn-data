  "text": "A variety of nights, live Do you crave the chance to see, hear and smell the performers of Saturday Night Live without the need for a tiny, electronic box? Well, you’re in luck, because plenty of the cast is setting off this summer to perform live in a variety of cities. Here’s a list of the SNL cast members possibly coming to a city near you. Unfortunately, if you live in Nome, Alaska, I’ve already checked for you: no dice, mon frere froid. Michael Longfellow The name of the game on SNL is often goofy get-ups and physical comedy. Don’t let that for a moment fool you into thinking that there aren’t still some classic self-deprecating kings among the lineup, however. Longfellow, who I recently saw here in New York — albeit during a Chris Gethard telethon where his set was constantly interrupted by the Buckcherry song “Crazy Bitch” — is a highly talented solo performer in his own right. See him yourself on his “No Worries If Not” tour this summer. Jane Wickline Wickline has made a name for herself tickling the compact, robot ivories of a digital keyboard on SNL. This summer, you’ll also be able to see her on tour with Liva Pierce performing their sketch show “DUKES” (no connection to the mayonnaise, at least I don’t think). Devon Walker Sometimes, when going to see an SNL cast member you can worry about their individual performance chops. No such worries with Walker, a dyed-in-the-wool stand-up who I had the pleasure of seeing in a very likely illegal BYOB stand-up show behind a New York bodega. I’d recommend the experience, though most venues probably frown on you bringing in two tall boy Lime-A-Ritas. See him on the “Smiling Through It All” Tour this summer. Emil Wakim Another performer for whom stand-up is far from a side gig is Wakim. I’ve seen him plenty of times here in New York, and he’s well worth going to see live. He’s also very nice, though that’s not really relevant to the matter at hand. He has a lot of cool sweaters as well. See which one he breaks out for your city this summer! Andrew Dismukes Dismukes has a decade-plus of stand-up under his belt. He got his start in Austin before the comedy scene there was invaded by people who were mad about how much income tax they had to pay on their phrenology podcast. See the comedy chops that brought him to the world's premiere sketch show live this summer at clubs across the country. James Austin Johnson Though the comic’s most well-known impressions of Biden and Trump may carry a subtext of dread these days, I’m here to tell you that he, as a performer, is much more than that. Seeing him live around New York City, his shows are a perfect combination of someone with impersonation skills that border on eerie along with spot-on writing. I can wholeheartedly recommend taking a two-drink minimum to see him if he's in your area this summer.
