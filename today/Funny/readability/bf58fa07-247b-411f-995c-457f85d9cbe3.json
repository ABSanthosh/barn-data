  "description": "When you're starting off in a job you're often taught a procedure and told that that procedure needs to be strictly followed each and every time—no exceptions. You quickly learn, however, that \"strictly\" and \"every time\" are not only inconvenient but ill-suited to handling the abnormal situations that quite obviously need to be handled as exceptions to what the handbook has outlined.In fact, not only are there a whole bunch of fringe situations that take some critical thinking, but the process itself is horrifically ineffective and inefficient, and there are way better ways to do things. Of course, especially early on in your career, you're not being paid to make these decisions, and everyone seems to rather that you just didn't. Especially when you encounter one of these managers who is a stickler for the rules and needs to see a process followed to the letter. It seems like they're not paying attention every time you make suggestions, but they somewhat perplexingly have no problem paying attention once they see you going off script.This teen who worked bagging groceries at a supermarket showed their boss a thing or two about the nonsensicality of \"always\" following the rules as written.",
