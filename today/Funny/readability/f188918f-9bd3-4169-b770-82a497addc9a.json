  "description": "When people usually start looking for a new job, the one thing they have to be mindful of is constantly being available on their phones. You always have to be ready to take calls from hiring managers, and every phone call might start the path that leads to a serious trajectory in your life. When one gets the call that they got the job, it is usually accompanied by a lot of happy emotions, unless there is something fishy about the call, like what happened in this Reddit story. When the hiring manager called OP (original poster) to tell them they got the job, OP did not expect the manager to tell her that he needed her to start the very next day. So much so that she actually thought he was joking, which later caused her to lose the job altogether. Keep scrolling to read what happened next. After that, click here for a story of a resident who got payback at workers who kept blocking his driveway.",
