  "description": "Every woman who has ever worked in customer service has had to deal with entitled customers who refused to give or show her any respect. Every woman who has ever worked in customer service was told by a customer at least once that they don't want her help, they want the help of a man who 'actually knows what he's talking about'.It doesn't even matter where you work, there are always going to be customers who refuse to be helped by a woman. And oh, how annoying these customers can be. How one deals with scenarios like these varies from case to case. You can give them what they want, and go find a man who can help them, you can let them be and watch from afar as they struggle alone, or you can find a way to teach them a lesson. Something that might get through the thick heads of theirs…Just like the two hardware store coworkers in the story below decided to do with the \"gentleman\" who approached them.",
