  "description": "Happy Sunday, I Can Has-ers. Memes have been around since basically the birth of the internet. If you're basically a dinosaur like us (AKA an aging millennial), you remember when the first meme hit the interwebz all those years ago. Not surprisingly, one of the first-ever memes was a cat meme, and they've been a hit ever since. Now, there are memes everwhere: memes about cooking, memes about Martha Stewart, memes about getting up early, but there is only one master of memes - and it is cat.You just can't get any better than cat memes - they are the purrfect mixture of wholesomeness, silliness, and sass that just makes each one a slam dunk every time (look at us, using sports references). They are also floofy and adorable, which you definitely can't say about coffee memes. So, if you had any doubt in your mind before this, expel it from your thoughts and get ready to learn once and for all why cats truly are the wholesome masters of memes. If you have any doubts remaining after, we encourage you to scroll through more here to further our point (although we're sure you won't need to).",
