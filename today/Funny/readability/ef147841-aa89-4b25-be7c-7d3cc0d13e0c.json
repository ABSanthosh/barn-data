  "description": "Nothing makes holiday travel more stressful than having to travel with a Karen. We know you have to know what a Karen is by now, but if not, just think of the most entitled person you know and now put them in the worst mood ever and have them try to confront any sort of slight inconvenience with diplomacy. That's right, you won't see any respect or adult behavior, you will see a grown person throwing a tantrum about something very insignificant. That is a Karen. So when you start to board a flight that is packed, during a time of year that is already busting with travel, and you encounter a Karen throwing a tantrum, you really start to lose faith in humanity. In this Redditor's case, he was just trying to do something to make everyone's lives a little easier, but the Karen couldn't compute that with out visual aid…",

  "text": "Those who don't live under a rock and have empathy, understand that not all disabilities are visible. From mental to easily masked physical ailments, it's none of our business. So when you see someone pre-boarding a flight who doesn't have kids or looks like anything is “wrong” with them, you leave them alone and mind your own business. For example, in the instance of this stroke survivor who looks “normal” but can't lift heavy objects, especially over his head into an overhead compartment, you would not be able to tell what's “wrong” with him. This Karen pre-boarding with her kids set a horrible example by rushing, intimidating, and mocking this poor man just because she couldn't compute why he was pre-boarding. She went so far that the flight attendant had to give her a talking to and even asked the man if he wanted to escalate the situation to the pilot. The man just wanted to get home for Christmas. But, it doesn't matter the time of year, a Karen is gonna Karen.",
