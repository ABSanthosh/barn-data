  "description": "If there is one thing homeowners are particular and passionate about above all other things, it's their property lines, and it makes total sense. After all, they have worked hard enough to own property and to be able to do whatever they want with it. Unfortunately, counties and HOAs can get in the way and ruin those simple joys.Here, we have a resident who was pressured into giving up 15' x 250' of property (that's 3,750 square feet, mind you!) to the county as part of a plan to extend a road in the neighborhood. I think it's fair to say that this dude held a grudge for over a year, one that would eventually win him that land back.",

  "text": "Once the author had to give up that 3,750 square feet of land, he began hatching a plan to get it all back. About a year later, he found his solution, which involved filing a complaint to the county about a drainage ditch on that land that needed to be cleaned out before the rainy season. This led to a week-long, expensive project for the county to fix the area. After another year, the author ended up getting his land back, and this time, he had all these brand new paved driveways from the project that he didn't even have to pay for. Kudos to him for staying persistent!",
