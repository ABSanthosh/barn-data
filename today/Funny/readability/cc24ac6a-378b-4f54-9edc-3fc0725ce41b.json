  "description": "These parents seem to treat sending their kids to school as more of a business transaction than anything else. Sure, if you're in the position to send your kids to an exclusive private school, you might want to ensure that wherever you choose to send them will be worth the hefty price of admission. However, for the vast majority of decent parents out there, any skepticism they may have about whether or not they are making the right choice is typically reserved to the school itself, not the capabilities of their own kid.In this instance, we have a couple who felt that their older daughter was a perfect fit for a private school due to her interest in STEM, while their younger daughter was unfit simply because she was more interested in the arts. From personal experience, I can confidently say that assessing whether or not your child is academically intelligent cannot be easily decided when they are in middle school. Students grow and evolve in surprising ways, and having a kid's parents limit their possibilities is nothing more than a discouraging sign.
