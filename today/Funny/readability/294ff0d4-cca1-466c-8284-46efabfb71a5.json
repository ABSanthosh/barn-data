  "description": "We know it's only Wednesday, but our office has already had enough of this week, and that's all thanks to our office cats, who went completely coo-coo. They were all led by Mr. Whiskers, the whimsical gent. Don't let his tuxie exterior fool you - he might look like a gentleman, but he's a coo-coo cat guy. He gathered Greta, the fluffy grey lady that usually naps by the sunny window, and Bug, the single-brain-celled orange who has a rubber chicken for a brain. Together, they tried to make all of us get up from our seats so they could sneak to the kitchen and steal all the treats.We don't really want to disclose how the events have folded (cats won, hoomans lost.) and we have only one way to deal with it, as we deal with every whimsical event on this Wednesday - a healthy load of fuzzy feisty feline memes to fetch some more of this cat craze.",
