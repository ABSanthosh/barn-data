At this point, it doesn’t matter if they mail me the limited-edition poster with his headshot on it. Too little, too late in my book. This totally ruined my birthday plans, too.” At press time, Angston had announced plans to get over the disappointment by purchasing a Preshow Party Package with Sen. Michael Bennet featuring specialty Bennet-themed cocktails. Like A Vitamin You Ingest With Your Eyes.
