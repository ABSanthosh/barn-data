  "description": "Having a clingy cat is one of the best things that could ever happen to a cat owner. We say this from experience. It's a blessing. Cuddling with your cat, chilling with your cat, sleeping next to your cat and waking up with them beside you… there is something so wholesome about it, so sweet. We love it. But we can't help but wonder, on those mornings that we wake up, and our cat, who we fell asleep next to, is no longer next to us… what were our cats doing in the middle of the night? Now, this urge never quite won over us. We did not, in fact, set up a camera to see what our cats to at night, but if we were this couple, we totally would have. Because not only do they have two clingy cats living with them, they also have three huskies - all of whom are allowed on the bed. So, one day, this couple finally decided to set up that camera and found out exactly what all of their pets do when they're sleeping.",
