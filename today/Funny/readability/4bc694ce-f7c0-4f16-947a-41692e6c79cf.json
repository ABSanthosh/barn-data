  "description": "If you thought life for a cat on the streets was tough, feline fam, the life of a lion is much worse. There are plenty of people who go out of their way to help and feed stray cats, but do you know of any people who feed outcast lions? We certainly don't. But that's what makes Ginger's story below so special. Ginger was the world's oldest recorded lion, who lived to a purrfectly remarkable age of 17 years in the wild. For reference, most don't live past 10.But Ginger's story isn't just about his age. He was cast out of his pride and lived solo for years, until one day, he approached a pride of lions, led by his sons. He arrived to them nearly blind, his teeth filed down by time, and his face filled with memories of his long life - and yet, they accepted him back into their pride. He did his time and earned their respect, which is one of the hardest things to come by in the animal kingdom. Fluff. Chaos. Drama! Our weekly cat newsletter has it all -  subscribe here.",
