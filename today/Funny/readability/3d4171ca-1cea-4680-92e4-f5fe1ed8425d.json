  "description": "Picture this, feline fam: You go to a shelter, all excited to adopt a new cat. Upon arrival, you comb through all the prospects, and then you find the purrfect one. This cat is loving, caring, and adjusts well to life at your home. Then, you get a phone call from the animal shelter, saying something you never thought you would hear - someone wants your new cat back. Wait, what? But it's our cat, how could it be their cat? And why did they get rid of them in the first place?Well, it turns out that their \"new cat\" was actually someone's cat who trusted their daughter to take care of their cats while they underwent a meowdical procedure. During this time, their selfish child surrendered not one, not two, but all five of their cats to a local shelter because their children had allergies and didn't want to deal with them. So what do you do? Do you give your cat back to their original owner, or keep them in their new home? This story is spicy and pawsitively juicy, so scroll down to read the full thread below!",

There are professional pet sitters to help deal with these kinds of things.  We agree, we also think we would have given the cat back, as much as it would have pained us to do so. It sounds rough, but at least all the cats are going back to a safe home where they will be loved. There are lots more cats that need homes though, so we're sure this family will have no trouble finding a new kitty companion in no time.",
