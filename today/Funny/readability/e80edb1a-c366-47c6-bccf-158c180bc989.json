  "text": "June 16, 2025 If you watched my Super Wizard Kart game from yesterday and you’d like to try running it yourself at home, I’ve collected all my rules into a PDF file you can download right here.  Obviously you’ll need to build your own track. You can use Dungeon Tiles like I did or you could draw out a track on a large gridded mat. You don't have stickers to build your karts but 3x5 cards with each part written on it work as well.  If you have any questions after reading over the rules feel free to hit me up on my BlueSky. I’d also love to see any pics of your home Super Wizard Kart games.  -Gabe Out",
