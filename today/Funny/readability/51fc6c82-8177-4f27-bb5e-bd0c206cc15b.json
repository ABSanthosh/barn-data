  "text": "Everyone was feeling good on a Friday morning Lorde just played a surprise set at the Glastonbury Festival in support of her brand new, highly-acclaimed album called Virgin — but a lot of people still can’t help but associate the singer with a middle-aged Colorado geologist-turned weed farmer. Famously, South Park once included a storyline about how Stan’s dad, Randy Marsh, was secretly leading a double life as Lorde. The twist began with a simple joke about Randy trying and failing to get Lorde to play at a backyard kids party. The gag was that Randy wasn’t Lorde, and his impersonation was laughably unconvincing. But the episode was completely misinterpreted by SPIN Magazine, who blasted Trey Parker and Matt Stone for mocking the young “Royals” singer. Don't Miss As a result, the South Park guys pivoted. Just six days after the SPIN article dropped, the show revealed that Randy really was Lorde, thanks to the magic of auto-tuning, which improved his vocals and edited out his fart noises. But Randy’s secret was very nearly exposed by an old-timey, fedora-wearing SPIN reporter.Lorde herself took the joke quite well. While she acknowledged that she didn’t watch South Park, she said that the episodes sounded “weird and cool” and noted that she was pleased to hear that Stan’s mom Sharon said nice things about her. Lorde later posted clips from the show on Instagram, and very briefly covered the “I Am Lorde Ya Ya Ya” song during an interview.  Even though it’s been over 10 whole years since those episodes aired, a lot of fans are clearly still not over this joke. When Lorde showed up to play a surprise Glastonbury set on Friday morning at the smaller Woodsies stage, crowds rushed to the tent and quickly “overwhelmed the space” as if the festival was handing out limited-edition McNugget sauce. On Reddit, a South Park fan claimed to have spotted an important detail amongst the many concertgoers: One person was carrying a flag depicting Randy Marsh/Lorde. RedditEven though it was a “surprise” set, fans had already speculated that the “TBA” artist would turn out to be be Lorde (The Guardian reported that the listing was “fooling no one”), which would explain why someone would bring Lorde-themed signage along. Thankfully the rumors turned out to be true. It would have been pretty embarrassing to be the guy waving around a Randy Marsh-as-Lorde flag during a surprise set by Rod Stewart.  Tags: News Scroll down for the next article Must Read SIGN UP FORA WEEKLYNEWSLETTER OF JOKES + TRIVIA",
