  "description": "We….do not have a snuggly cat. As much as we wish we did (and as much as we tried to make her a snuggly cat), it's just not in the cards for us. We tried luring her to the bed with treats, playing relaxing music, and even holding her there against her will - none of it worked. Maybe our next cat will be a cuddly cat, or, we'll just live vicariously through the lives of strangers on the internet and not be jealous at all of all of their outrageously cute cuddly cats.Not only are they cuddly, but they appawrently like to cuddle right next to their pawrents' faces because they're just that silly and awwdorable. They probably can't breathe very well at night, but if that was a burden we had to bear, we would bear it with purrfect pride because it would be absolutely worth it. Enjoy this snuggly selection of cute cats competing for cuddles below, we're going to try to lure our cat into bed one more time. Have a great week!",
