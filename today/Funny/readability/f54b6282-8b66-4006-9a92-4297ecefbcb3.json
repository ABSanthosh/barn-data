  "description": "Hey, can I copy your homework… Sure, just let me report you to the academic honesty office first. Ready for another old joke? What do you call a Med Student who got all D's by copying his friend's homework?Doctor!..We've all been there, you forgot about a test or an assignment, or just got too busy in our personal life and couldn't get it done beforehand. You come rushing, blustering into class slyly and as quietly as possible, trying to get your friend's attention so that you can try and get their homework off them and quickly copy some answers down before the teacher asks everyone to turn it in.",

  "text": "\"Friend\" here is used pretty loosely, but even study partners deserve a bit of honest conversation and hashing things out before you turn them into authorities. Let's be real, what's going on here is actually a good bit worse than just copying notes… The fact that he's actually taking credit for work that someone else has done and submitting something he copied verbatim as his own work leads to a huge issue of credibility here.Still, is the Med Student's reaction extreme, or does the punishment here fit the crime?",
