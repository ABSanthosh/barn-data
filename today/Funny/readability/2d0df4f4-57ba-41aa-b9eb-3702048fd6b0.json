The Onion fact-checks Kennedy on health.  Claim: Fluoride is a “toxic pollutant” and “industrial waste” that should be taken out of public drinking water. False: Water fluoridation is a completely safe way to turn the population gay. Claim: Raw milk is good for you.  False: We’re pretty sure he’s thinking of yogurt.  Claim: Direct-to-consumer advertising for pharmaceuticals is harmful. False: For many Americans, these ads are the only opportunity they have to watch a woman sea kayak with her husband.  Claim: RFK Jr.’s health claims have proven to increase lifespans. True: However, it is easy to beat the average Kennedy lifespan. Claim: Lobbyists need to be removed from the healthcare process. True: But good luck with that, big guy.  Claim: Antidepressants cause mass shootings. Unverified: No one will ever know what causes mass shootings, so there’s no point in even thinking about them. Claim: Chinese citizens are far less susceptible to Covid-19 than Americans. Partially true: With RFK Jr. in charge, pretty much everyone will be healthier than Americans.",
