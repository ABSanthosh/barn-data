  "description": "When you're staying with friends or family it's not like you're staying at a hotel, sure there's a certain amount of hospitality that you might receive, especially if you're visiting as a one off thing, but that doesn't mean your friends have a dedicated housekeeping service and any mess you leave around the place they're going to end up cleaning themselves. Even in hotels, which have housekeeping services, you still need to be considerate and not leave a mess just because you're too inconsiderate and lazy to clean up after yourself.Further, while it's great to \"live cheap\" and \"be frugal,\" it doesn't count if you're just taking advantage of other people's goodwill and leeching off of them in order to keep your own costs down. We've all had that friend or roommate who insists that they have no spending money ever and let you pay for them for things or help themself to your food and drinks. Then one day you come to find that they actually have a sizable amount of savings and have just somehow rationalized that putting all their money in their Savings account and none of it in their Checking account somehow entitles them to leech off of others.",

The fact that her boyfriend is unwilling to have this hard conversation with his “friend” for the benefit of the woman who is carrying his child shows how spineless he really is.",
