  "description": "Isn't it the best feeling when you've finally made and accepted the decision to quit that deadend job you've been working at for way too long? That job that has totally compromised your mental health and only paid you pennies? Yeah, it feels so job to say goodbye to all of that. You could be the bigger person and do it the societally acceptable way of giving a two week's notice and saying cordial goodbyes yadda yadda yadda. But why give them that dignity? Did they ever return that kind of respect?? NO. So drop the mic and quit on the spot—walk out feeling satisfied that justice was served! You can see a beautiful example of that with this delivery woman. She was already planning on quitting, but was going to try and do it a little bit more politely. Even though the job was the worse. But after a snarky remark from a coworker, she pivoted and decided to quit in a spicier way.",
