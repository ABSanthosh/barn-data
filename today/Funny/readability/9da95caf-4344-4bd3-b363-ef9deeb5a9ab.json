  "description": "Howdy, feline fam. We just want to check something with you - does your calendar say it's only Wednesday, too? Ours does, and we're pawsitive that it must be wrong. It feels like at least Thursday, if not Furiday. So there's no way it can be Wednesday, right? Okay, good, as long as we both agree that it's definitely after Wednesday, then we're fine. We'd like to tell you that the timelessly silly feline funnies we collected below are purrfect for getting you ready for Caturday, but that wouldn't be the truth. They're not even ready to pump you up for Furiday. They might get you out of that midweek slump you're currently sitting in, though. These cat memes may be pawerful, but they are not all-pawerful (unfortunately). They cannot meowgically make it Furiday, but they can make you smile, no matter what day it is. Even if it is only Wednesday.Let's giggle for a few minutes together and try to get through the middle of the week with some pawsitivity, okay?Fluff. Chaos. Drama! Our weekly cat newsletter has it all -  subscribe here.",
