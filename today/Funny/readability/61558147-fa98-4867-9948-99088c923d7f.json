  "description": "Look, this is not the first time that we have come across a story about a cat outsmarting its humans. It happens all the time. You turn away for one second, and suddenly, your cats will lock you out of your own bathroom. You turn away for another second, and before you know it, your cat will have stolen food right off your plate. Your cats will go out of their way to drive you crazy, because it's fun for them. At least we think so. Otherwise, why would they be doing these things so often?Cats are causing all of this chaos to remind us who the actual boss of the house is, and it would be good for us to remember. If just knew it in advance, if we caved into their demands, if we could simply read their little kitty cat minds and give them everything that they want every second of every day, then they would stop with the madness. But until that day… the chaos continues, and we have to do what these cat owners did and come up with as many creative solutions to our problems as we can.",

How many arguments did you have - with each other and with the cat? We need the laugh. We deserve it.  It's just hilarious to know that this is not the first cat owner this happened to. And not only that, but that it is not the first cat owner who had to come up with creative (and hissterical) solutions about how to deal with the problem. Cats don't mess around when it comes to their food.",
