Well, having to abide by the rules of your roommates, no matter how small or outrageous their wishes may seem. Are you the unruly roommate? Or, are you like the user in this story who feels like they're under a constant microscope in their home? You've read about food thieves and roommates with cleaning aversions, but this story takes the STEAK.The story poster explains that she went to turn the oven on in her apartment to cook some food. Lo and behold, her roommate was storing and marinating a steak in the bottom rack of the oven and failed to mention this to her. Instead of understanding, the roommate got irrationally angry but still refused to be paid back (the poster insisted she do so). Now, the internet is convincing her she shouldn't go out of her way to give her roomie the money back because her roomie had no right to be upset at her for her own misstep. Commenters are \"forbid[ding]\" her from coughing up the cash. What do you think? Scroll to read the entire story.",

    "description": "Everyone remembers being asked as a kid what they wanted to be when they grew up. A firefighter. A ballerina. A veterinarian. When you grow up a little bit, these dreams will probably change, but everyone does have that elusive \"dream job:\" the one job you could work every day of your life, and it would never feel like work. It's rare that you make it to your dream job, so the dream changes and gets a little smaller. In this case, it's best when you hit the sweet spot of a job: it isn't your whole life, but you enjoy the work you're doing, and you believe it's meaningful work. That's the ideal life we all want to live. We feel comfortable in our means, we do work we're proud of, and we can still live a good life outside of the 9-5.When you secure this position, life feels like Swiss cheese. But, like many things in life, your job can pull the rug out from under you faster than your first paycheck hits your bank account. One woman gets unsavory information about her position at her seemingly perfect job. Should she keep her wits about her and be prepared to look elsewhere, or should she remain hopeful?",

But really though, marriage is a beautiful thing. It's the happiest day of your life, hopefully. It's also a very stressful day. For those of you who are married, you know the craziness that comes on your wedding day. You have a schedule that's packed tighter than a cat in a purrito, there is no margin for error and no time for any distractions.That is, unless, the cat distribution system knocks on your door. Imagine you're getting ready, your hair and makeup are done, you take your two-minute and 30-second break in the schedule to walk around and get some fresh air….and then you hear some meowing. Not just one meow, but four, eight, sixteen meows! Naturally, you investigate. You find four kittens in the venue, so what else can you do except put your wedding on hold and rescue the smol little babies? That's exactly what happened below, so scroll down to watch the whole heartwarming video!",

    "description": "Are you a pawrent of an orange cat? If you are, on the one hand - you have less to worry about, because you have the cat but minus the brain. So, technically, it's less to worry about, because it's literally less of a thing in the cat. But on the other hand, the fact your orange buddy has yet to obtain the single brain cell all orange cats share creates other things you should worry about. Like the orange cat behavior. And yes, we're 200% sure that if you're an orange cat pawrent you know exactly what sort of behavior we're talking about. The orange kind.For everyone else who does not pawrent an orange feline friend, let us demonstrate it to you with the power of memes. We gathered some cat memes that demonstrate the power of a 0 brain cell orange cat to create silly chaos all around them. But it's not just the chaos, it's the… orangeness. And it's definitely great for meme material. It's no wonder this genre of cat memes is flourishing.",

    "description": "A Representative Line is a short snippet that makes you think, \"wow, I'd hate to see the rest of the code.\" A CodeSOD is a longer snippet, which also frequently makes you think, \"wow, I'd hate to see the rest of the code,\" but also is bad in ways that require you to look at the relationship between the lines in the code. I bring that up, because today's code sample is a long section, but really, it's just a collection of representative lines. Each line in this just makes me die a little on the inside. Belda found this: ## helper functions function stripmagic($x) { return get_magic_quotes_gpc() ? stripslashes($x) : $x; } function pre_r(\u0026$x) { return ''.PHSC(print_r($x, true)).''; } function PSS($x) { return str_replace('\\\\\"','\"',$x); } function PVS($x) { return preg_replace(\"/\\n[^\\\\S\\n]*(?=\\n)/\", \"\\n\u003c:vspace\u003e\", $x); } function PVSE($x) { return PVS(PHSC($x, ENT_NOQUOTES)); } function PZZ($x,$y='') { return ''; } function PRR($x=NULL) { if ($x || is_null($x)) $GLOBALS['RedoMarkupLine']++; return $x; } function PUE($x) { return preg_replace('/[\\\\x80-\\\\xff \\'\"\u003c\u003e]/e', \"'%'.dechex(ord('$0'))\", $x); } function SDV(\u0026$v,$x) { if (!isset($v)) $v=$x; } function SDVA(\u0026$var,$val) { foreach($val as $k=\u003e$v) if (!isset($var[$k])) $var[$k]=$v; } This collection of one-line \"helper\" functions has it all. Cryptic function names. PRR mutates global variables. PZZ just… returns an empty string. I don't know what PHSC does, and I don't want to, but it's called inside of pre_r and PVSE. Which I also don't know what they do. Speaking of PVSE, I note the regex is using backreferences, which is some advanced regex but I still have no idea what it's doing. I could figure it out, but I don't want to. PUE looks like it might be handling some misencoded characters, maybe. SDV is maybe kinda a coalesce function. Each line is its own representative line. None of this is code I'd want to maintain. On the flip side, the abbreviated function names, when read in reverse order, are exactly the sounds I made when I read this code: \"SDVASDVPUEPRRPZZPVSEPVSPSS\". It's okay, the doctors say I'll make a full recovery.
