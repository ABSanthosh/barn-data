    "description": "Happy Sunday, I Can Has-ers. Memes have been around since basically the birth of the internet. If you're basically a dinosaur like us (AKA an aging millennial), you remember when the first meme hit the interwebz all those years ago. Not surprisingly, one of the first-ever memes was a cat meme, and they've been a hit ever since. Now, there are memes everwhere: memes about cooking, memes about Martha Stewart, memes about getting up early, but there is only one master of memes - and it is cat.You just can't get any better than cat memes - they are the purrfect mixture of wholesomeness, silliness, and sass that just makes each one a slam dunk every time (look at us, using sports references). They are also floofy and adorable, which you definitely can't say about coffee memes. So, if you had any doubt in your mind before this, expel it from your thoughts and get ready to learn once and for all why cats truly are the wholesome masters of memes. If you have any doubts remaining after, we encourage you to scroll through more here to further our point (although we're sure you won't need to).",

And then it's the creaming for \"Open the door. No, close it. I mean open it. Now close the door again.\", but that's ok, it's the weekend and you love your cat. The door will be opened and closed and opened and closed.Even that is not enough cat for the weekend! In between the sassy Sunday cat demands you have time for more cat demands - in meme form.

Engagement, devoid of context or meaning, is the coin of the realm where data has proliferated beyond our ability to meaningfully process it.

    "description": "It's often said that you should never stoop to someone else's level and, instead, take the high road and go on to live a better life, beating them through their inability to affect you. Well, truth be told, that's not really all that much fun, and it's not very practical at times since it doesn't really solve the immediate problem at hand. And when that immediate problem at hand is your daily at-home parking situation—well, it's kind of hard to just walk away and ignore it since, you know, you need somewhere to park.Most apartment complexes have assigned parking spaces, explicitly defined parking spaces that are expressly assigned as a rule. This is not kept secret either; it's pretty clear based on all the signage and numbers in each spot as to whose spot is whose, and if there is first-come-first-serve parking, it's usually somewhere entirely different and away from the units. Still, some people just choose to ignore this and park wherever they want to anyway. And it's really hard to logic what must be going through these people's minds when they make these decisions.When this woman and apartment dweller found that her neighbor had been taking her spot, she asked her neighbor to stop. When the neighbor continually ignored her requests, she realized the only way to stop this was to play her own game…",

Maybe they're constantly napping, but the supervisor just cheerfully walks by without noticing. Or maybe they constantly leave work early without an excuse, but the boss couldn't care less. Or, if you're like some of the people who answered u/Virtual-Bunch-9131's query to r/AskReddit, maybe your coworker went to further extremes and still didn't get the boot!It can be totally infuriating to work diligently at your 9-5, only to watch your coworker who definitely makes more money than you slack off. Every time you glance at them, they're scrolling Facebook or watching YouTube videos without headphones. They miss deadlines and never know what's going on… but still, the boss loves them, so they'll never fired. Ugh! Some people's coworkers did even worse things and still didn't get kicked out of their positions. It just goes to show how arbitrary things are in the workplace: if you're a nepo-hire or you're the boss's favorite person to goof off with, your job is safe forever. After that, these neighbors were worried that a 13-year-old snowboarder was going to break their fence or have an accident, so they impolitely demanded to \"speak to the landowner.\"",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/join-our-naming",
    "description": "As a general rule, if you're using an RDBMS and can solve your problem using SQL, you should solve your problem using SQL. It's how we avoid doing joins or sorts in our application code, which is always a good thing. But this is a general rule. And Jasmine sends us one where solving the problem as a query was a bad idea. ALTER FUNCTION [dbo].[GetName](@EntityID int) RETURNS varchar(200) AS BEGIN declare @Name varchar(200) select @Name = case E.EntityType when 'Application' then A.ApplicationName when 'Automation' then 'Automated Process' when 'Group' then G.GroupName when 'Organization' then O.OrgName when 'Person' then P.FirstName + ' ' + P.LastName when 'Resource' then R.ResourceName when 'Batch' then B.BatchComment end from Entities E left join AP_Applications A on E.EntityID = A.EntityID left join CN_Groups G on E.EntityID = G.EntityID left join CN_Organizations O on E.EntityID = O.EntityID left join CN_People P on E.EntityID = P.EntityID left join Resources R on E.EntityID = R.EntityID left join AR_PaymentBatches B on E.EntityID = B.EntityID where E.EntityID = @EntityID return @Name END The purpose of this function is to look up the name of an entity. Depending on the kind of entity we're talking about, we have to pull that name from a different table. This is a very common pattern in database normalization- a database equivalent of inheritance. All the common fields to all entities get stored in an Entities table, while specific classes of entity (like \"Applications\") get their own table which joins back to the Entities table. On the surface, this code doesn't even really look like a WTF. By the book, this is really how you'd write this kind of function- if we were going by the book. But the problem was that these tables were frequently very large, and even with indexes on the EntityID fields, it simply performed horribly. And since \"showing the name of the thing you're looking at\" was a common query, that performance hit added up. The fix was easy- write out seven unique functions- one for each entity type- and then re-write this function to use an IF statement to decide which one to execute. The code was simpler to understand and read, and performed much faster. In the end, perhaps not really a WTF, or perhaps the root WTF is some of the architectural decisions which allow this to exist (why a function for getting the name, and the name alone, which means we execute this query independently and not part of a more meaningful join?). But I think it's an interesting example of how \"this is the right way to do it\" can lead to some unusual outcomes.
