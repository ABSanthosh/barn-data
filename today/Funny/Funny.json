    "description": "There's a pretty simple rule when it comes to parking in a neighborhood: don't block driveways. Heck, it's polite to even make sure that you leave an adequate amount of room (at least a couple of feet) next to the driveway so that the people who live there can get in and out of their homes unencumbered. While there are grey areas for this kind of thing, it's definitely right out and crossing a line to just up and park in front of someone's driveway. It sort of boggles the mind why someone would think that was ok, but well... here we are. Even if you're just sitting in your car like the person in this story, it's definitely not an ok thing to be doing. Especially when you're then politely asked to move by a resident and then go back to texting on your phone, you should probably reconsider what the heck it is you're doing with your life.",

    "description": "It's the spooky season once again, and the internet is ready to celebrate with some of their funniest and shortest horror stories. Could you tell a scary story in just six words? It's harder than it looks! We all know the classic short sad story, \"For sale: baby shoes, never worn,\" written by Ernest Hemingway. The sentence has become a meme online, with plenty of people changing up the template to make their own jokey version of the story (\"For sale: baby shoes, quite haunted,\" is just one example!). Although Hemingway nailed it with his classic story, it can be hard to think of something sad or scary that can be conveyed in so few words. But that didn't stop the internet from trying anyway!Though the challenge of creating a horror story in just six words isn't as easy as it seems, these X users took the Halloween challenge in stride! But also, a lot of people wrote their own funny versions of @MammonsGreedy's prompt too, and you can check out some of the funniest ones down below. After that, read about this bold grandfather who \"pretended to be on a secret mission… for 20 years\" in order to get a tiny bit more food from his favorite restaurant.",

They found a way to charm the \"smartest species on the planet\" into taking care of them, paying for their every need, and basically doing whatever they want them to do. They are the real financial gurus you should be following on Instagram. They pay for their rent with snuggles, get their food delivered to them every day with pawsitively impeccable service, and have people make digital feline funnies in their honor literally every day.So, if you're looking to improve your financial status, look no further than these hilarious cat memes that could purrfectly double as financial advice. Well, sort of. Come to think of it, we actually pay for all of those things for them. Basically, the moral of these memes is that if you need something, you need to convince another hooman to do it for you. They just pay for it with snuggles and occasional affection. Maybe they're not so helpful after all. Oh well, at least they're hissterical!",

We deal with little fuzzy criminals that cause chaos all day, and yet, we love them more than life itself. We have the most compassion for our tiny little house goblins, and almost as much for the heartwarming people who choose to live with them (as if we had any choice in the matter…we all know that it's actually the cats that choose us).One Redditor made a purrfectly sweet introduction of their new, precious pirate kitty, and the whole cat community came out to welcome them with pictures of their own cute pirate cats and others who just wanted to be friends. This type of love and support is what we love writing about most here at I Can Has Cheezburger. So, if you need a reason to smile today, congratulations, you've found it!

    "description": "I play Rainbow Six Siege every day. I’m absolutely hooked on this game. At first I was just playing it because I wanted to play with my boys and it was something we could all do together, but now I play alone while they're at school. There’s so much to learn between almost a hundred different operators and tons of unique maps with destructible walls which make them ridiculously mutable. I’d say that map awareness is the most important skill you can have in Rainbow Six Siege and that takes a lot of time to get a handle on. I’ve been playing for months now and I feel like I understand the various bomb sites in each map but I’m just starting to understand the connective tissue between sites and how everything connects. The game having so much to learn is part of the reason I think I’m still hooked. Every game I play I’m still learning and that’s rewarding.",

    "description": "I've never installed cheats, not even to satisfy a morbid curiosity, in the same way that Gandalf feared the power of The Ring. The metaphor continues from there, because my era of cheats always had a dark nimbus; you were just rawdogging some mysterioso executable. God only knows what you're gonna catch. Matters are different now for cheats, to hear Mork's boys tell it, because they're essentially things you subscribe to. I'd never looked them up. I was curious how hard it would be to find, and they're, uh, not. They're not hard to find. I was startled at the professionalism - the 24/7 support line, the layout, and of course the fifty dollar a month price tag. Let me emphasize again: there is a support line for these game-shredding hacks. Kiko enunciated it well; in the era of service gaming, not just an assemblage of random hosts, it's a constant war like that of an immune system. The cheats, then, must be services also.",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/join-our-naming",
    "description": "As a general rule, if you're using an RDBMS and can solve your problem using SQL, you should solve your problem using SQL. It's how we avoid doing joins or sorts in our application code, which is always a good thing. But this is a general rule. And Jasmine sends us one where solving the problem as a query was a bad idea. ALTER FUNCTION [dbo].[GetName](@EntityID int) RETURNS varchar(200) AS BEGIN declare @Name varchar(200) select @Name = case E.EntityType when 'Application' then A.ApplicationName when 'Automation' then 'Automated Process' when 'Group' then G.GroupName when 'Organization' then O.OrgName when 'Person' then P.FirstName + ' ' + P.LastName when 'Resource' then R.ResourceName when 'Batch' then B.BatchComment end from Entities E left join AP_Applications A on E.EntityID = A.EntityID left join CN_Groups G on E.EntityID = G.EntityID left join CN_Organizations O on E.EntityID = O.EntityID left join CN_People P on E.EntityID = P.EntityID left join Resources R on E.EntityID = R.EntityID left join AR_PaymentBatches B on E.EntityID = B.EntityID where E.EntityID = @EntityID return @Name END The purpose of this function is to look up the name of an entity. Depending on the kind of entity we're talking about, we have to pull that name from a different table. This is a very common pattern in database normalization- a database equivalent of inheritance. All the common fields to all entities get stored in an Entities table, while specific classes of entity (like \"Applications\") get their own table which joins back to the Entities table. On the surface, this code doesn't even really look like a WTF. By the book, this is really how you'd write this kind of function- if we were going by the book. But the problem was that these tables were frequently very large, and even with indexes on the EntityID fields, it simply performed horribly. And since \"showing the name of the thing you're looking at\" was a common query, that performance hit added up. The fix was easy- write out seven unique functions- one for each entity type- and then re-write this function to use an IF statement to decide which one to execute. The code was simpler to understand and read, and performed much faster. In the end, perhaps not really a WTF, or perhaps the root WTF is some of the architectural decisions which allow this to exist (why a function for getting the name, and the name alone, which means we execute this query independently and not part of a more meaningful join?). But I think it's an interesting example of how \"this is the right way to do it\" can lead to some unusual outcomes.

    "description": "When processing HTTP requests, you frequently need to check the parameters which were sent along with that request. Those parameters are generally passed as stringly-typed key/value pairs. None of this is news to anyone. What is news, however, is how Brodey's co-worker indexed the key/value pairs. For i As Integer = 0 To (Request.Params().Count - 1) If (parameters.GetKey(i).ToString() \u003c\u003e \"Lang\") Then If (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"ID\")) OrElse (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"new\")) OrElse _ (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"open\")) OrElse (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"FID\")) _ OrElse (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"enabled\")) OrElse (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"my\")) OrElse _ (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"msgType\")) OrElse (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"Type\")) _ OrElse (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"EID\")) OrElse (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"Title\")) OrElse _ (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"ERROR\")) Then URLParams \u0026= \"\u0026\" \u0026 parameters.GetKey(i).ToString() URLParams \u0026= \"=\" \u0026 parameters(i).ToString() End If End If Next The goal of this code is to take a certain set of keys and construct a URLParams string which represents those key/values as an HTTP query string. The first thing to get out of the way: .NET has a QueryString type that handles the construction of the query string for you (including escaping), so that you don't need to do any string concatenation. But the real WTF is everything surrounding that. We opt to iterate across every key- not just the ones we care about- and use the GetKey(i) function to check each individual key in an extensive chain of OrElse statements. The obvious and simpler approach would have been to iterate across an array of the keys I care about- ID, new, FID, enabled, my, msgType, Type, EID, Title, ERROR- and simply check if they were in the Request. I suppose the only silver lining here is that they thought to use the OrElse operator- which is a short-circuiting \"or\" operation, like you'd expect in just about any other language, instead of Or, which doesn't short circuit (pulling double duty as both a bitwise Or and a logical Or, because Visual Basic wants to contribute some WTFs).
