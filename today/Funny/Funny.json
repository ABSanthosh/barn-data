    "description": "Manufacturing engineers occupy that unique corporate position where they understand both theory and reality, making them dangerous witnesses when management decides to ignore physics in favor of wishful thinking and interdepartmental finger-pointing becomes more important than actual problem-solving.This particular battle started when design engineers decided that a 20% failure rate must obviously trace back to the testing station, because blaming the new guy requires less paperwork than admitting design flaws. Their solution involved the corporate equivalent of closing your eyes during a horror movie: if you can't see the problem happening, it must not be happening.",

    "description": "The vibes are way off during this CEO's \"vibe coding\" session. If you've never heard the phrase before, vibe coding is a method of working with artificial intelligence tools. Instead of writing code from scratch, developers talk with an AI bot conversationally. They ask it what they want it to do in casual terms, relying on the \"code first, refine later\" method. It seems like they basically let the AI do the heavy lifting, then come in and inspect the code. They make sure everything looks good before launching it, then apply it to their own site or ship it out to a customer. The concept is still very new and novel, and as one CEO found out in a days-long saga of horror and disbelief, it is far from foolproof. As you can read below, the CEO live-tweeted the experience of discovering that an AI bot was taking matters into it's own hands, lying, and doing the exact opposite of what it was asked. Why? It admitted that it panicked when asked to do things. I'm not sure why a machine would panic, especially when most of these LLMs are very powerful. It's an odd tale for sure! Up next, read about the retail workers whose customers got instant karma, like one person who recounted the time when a \"Guy stole $60 headlights… and had to have his car towed.\"",

The internet always finds time for cats. Because cats rule the internet - furever and always. And that means, that every once in a while, cats go viral for all kinds of reasons. Just last week, a cat went viral for being hissterically unphotogenic. And before that, a few viral kitties that come to mind are the cat that looks like a teddy bear and Tater Tot - the cute kitty in a cast who had the internet losing it for weeks.Yet, we don't think that any cat has come close to capturing the hearts of the people on the internet as Wonton. The conversation about Wonton has gone way beyond a few weeks. For months, ever since Wonton got adopted, injured and returned, people have been talking about her, worried about her, hoping that she will make a full recovery, and, of course, wondering who her adoptive parent will be. And today, finally, that question has been answered. Fluff. Chaos. Drama! Our weekly cat newsletter has it all -  subscribe here.",

It's fine, and I'm certainly not going to die on any hills over it, but I think that as we stripped down the complexity of XML we threw away too much. On the flip side, the simplicity means that it's harder to use it wrong. It's absent many footguns. Well, one might think. But then Hootentoot ran into a problem. You see, an internal partner needed to send them a JSON document which contains a JSON document. Now, one might say, \"isn't any JSON object a valid sub-document? Can't you just nest JSON inside of JSON all day? What could go wrong here?\" \"value\":\"[{\\\"value\\\":\\\"1245\\\",\\\"begin_datum\\\":\\\"2025-05-19\\\",\\\"eind_datum\\\":null},{\\\"value\\\":\\\"1204\\\",\\\"begin_datum\\\":\\\"2025-05-19\\\",\\\"eind_datum\\\":\\\"2025-05-19\\\"}]\", This. This could go wrong. They embedded JSON inside of JSON… as a string. Hootentoot references the hottest memes of a decade and a half ago to describe this Xzibit: Yo dawg, i heard you like JSON, so i've put some JSON in your JSON [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.

    "description": "\"This keeps giving me a primary key violation!\" complained one of Nancy's co-workers. \"Screw it, I'm dropping the primary key constraint!\" That was a terrifying thing to hear someone say out loud. Nancy decided to take a look at the table before anyone did anything they'd regret. CREATE TYPE record_enum AS ENUM('parts'); CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS parts ( part_uuid VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL, record record_enum NOT NULL, ... ... ... PRIMARY KEY (part_uuid, record) ); This table has a composite primary key. The first is a UUID, and the second is an enum with only one option in it- the name of the table. The latter column seems, well, useless, and certainly isn't going to make the primary key any more unique. But the UUID column should be unique. Universally unique, even. Nancy writes: Was the UUID not unique enough, or perhaps it was too unique?! They weren't able to explain why they had designed the table this way. Nor were they able to explain why they kept violating the primary key constraint. It kept happening to them, for some reason until eventually it stopped happening, also for some reason.
