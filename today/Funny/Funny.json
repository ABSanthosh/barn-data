    "description": "Goof off in the workplace too much and you might find yourself having a serious chat with HR and your boss. It's all fun and games until you get caught, and the people who shared their firing stories below can tell you some stories.  Some jobs take employee surveillance really seriously, and they'll use cameras and nosy managers to make sure the employees are working constantly. Even so, a lot of employees manage to sneak away from their desks for long breaks, take long stretches of time off work using flimsy excuses, and some will even manage to take naps in their cars. At other workplaces, employees aren't supervised as closely, so they can get away with even more mischief. There's also the type of worker who can't help but brag in front of their coworkers, leading to trouble. The dude who decided to lift up his own car with his forklift could tell you all about that.

    "description": "If you're looking for one way to see what incompetence and interminable pointlessness look like in their fullest forms, just get summoned to jury duty. Speaking as someone who has survived a two-week-long process myself, I an attest to the fact that nothing truly makes up for the mundanity of the process. Most folks can attest to this, even if they're the lucky ones who have never made it past the selection process.Here, we have a juror who, for some unknowable and strange reason, was excited about serving his civic duty. However, it always seems like the people who genuinely want to serve on a jury are the ones who are destined not to have that experience. Less than an hour into this trial, which seemingly was a juicy, criminal case, one of the older jurors fell asleep and started snoring loudly. Somehow, the judge decided that the only way to rectify this was to dismiss the entire jury and go through the whole selection process again the following day. So while everyone else was relieved to not have to spend the next several days and possibly weeks in a courthouse, this one juror had his hopes and dreams, all because of a tired, elderly lady.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.

Gosh, we're running on empty. But you know what? We're lucky because we're cat pawrents. If you're a cat pawrent too, you know exactly what we mean. When your energy is completely gone, you just find where your fluffy feline friend is lounging and… plop down next to them. Cats are like living chargers - restoring us, their tired tottered hoomans, with their calming purrs and an endless supply of cozy cat vibes. They're the ultimate remedy for these post-holiday, pre-New Year blahs.While you snuggle up next to your cat, why not scroll through these relatable memes for cat pawrents? Because let's face it, these days between holidays are so much better when you're hanging out with your cat.

    "description": "Happy Sunday, feline fam. If you didn't love cats before, this is the video to convince you otherwise. You can't not fall in love with snow leopards. They're literally the definition of awwdorable. They're so floofy, playful, and best of all, they hold their tails in their mouths for no apparent reason. It's the best. Anyway, one 19-year-old snow leopard (the equivalent of 100 human years!) seemed to be nearing the end of its life. It was slowing down, not eating well, and refusing to be its normal, playful self. Until, one day, the zookeepers introduced a young cub to the senior snow leopard's quarters. Their relationship started off as a rocky one, but eventually, they learned to love each other. They grew closer and closer until they became like family. What did the zookeepers see after that? The senior snow leopard made a miraculous recovery, managing to live another 7 years! It's a purrfeclty heartwarming video showing the power of love and how impurrtant family is (especially a chosen one). Scroll down to read the full story below!",

Yet Yitz O. , up to some kind of skullduggery, observed a spacetime oddity. \"When trying to compare some results from a GetOrders call via the ebay api, I noticed something weird was happening with the DateTimes in the response. The attached is 3 calls to get the same order, made in quick succession. The millisecond part of all the DateTimes matched the millisecond part of the *current* time (which you can see in the TimeStamp field. I assume it's because they rolled their own DateTime functionality and are Getting a UTC time by subtracting the difference between the local time and the UTC time, and one of those values doesn't have the millisecond value in it, but it's the ebay api so who knows.\" Undoubtedly a bug that nobody ever noticed because they probably just ignore the millis altogether.   An anonymous smartie wrote that \"Concerned about the possibility of creeping senesence, I've been looking for some way to benchmark and track cognitive performance over time. This site purported to offer an online version of a common medical assessment, so I figured I'd give it a try. But what's that first field asking about?   Naturally, I filled it in:   Apparently that was the wrong answer, but the error message here is singularly unhelpful. A trick question? Or proof that I'm already too far gone?   (The answer is on the page but it is a bit subtle.) A first-time submission, I think, from Bill S. \"The Explore DDD Conference site wants you to join their mailing list; it would help if their submit button did something other than a silent 404 error.\"   \"Yes, we have no listings,\" explained Peter G. fruitlessly. Check back next week.   In a more fruitful vein, Jeremy P. decided he \"Needed to look up a word from NYT connections.

    "description": "As we enter that little gap between Christmas and New Year's, we explore some of the highlights of 2024. We start with this historical computing story. And unlike the subject, this shipped ready to read (and reprint). --Remy Today's anonymously submitted story is a case where the WTF isn't the code itself, per se. This arguably could be a CodeSOD, and we'll get to the code, but there's so much more to the story. Our submitter, let's call them Janice, used to work for a financial institution with a slew of legacy systems. One such system was an HP3000 minicomputer. \"Mini\", of course, meant \"refrigerator sized\". The HP3000 itself is an interesting, if peripheral story, because it's one of the tales of a product launch going incredibly wrong. Let's talk a little history. We start with the HP2100 in 1966, which Hewlett Packard did nothing to design, and instead purchased the company that designed it. The core innovation of the HP2100 was that it was architecturally similar to a PDP-8, but supported full 16-bit memory, instead of PDP's 12-bit. HP didn't really know what they had bought- they marketed it as a \"test and instrumentation\" system, and were surprised when businesses purchased it for back office operations. They ended up with one of the most popular minicomputers for office use, despite it not being designed for that purpose. Thus began the projects \"Alpha\" and \"Omega\". Alpha was a hardware refresh of the 2100, with a better memory model. Omega was a ground-up redesign for 32-bit memory, which would allow it to support a whopping 4MB of RAM. There was just one problem with the Omega design: they didn't have funding to actually finish it. The project was killed in 1970, which threw some of the staff into \"wear black armbands to work\" levels of mourning. Unfortunately, while work was done on Omega, the scope of Alpha crept, which resulted in another project management wasn't sure could be delivered. But the market was there for a time-sharing minicomputer, so they pressed on despite the concerns. The HP2000-line had time sharing system that used multiple processors. There was a front-end processor which handled user interactions. Then there was the actual CPU, which ran programs. This meant that time-sharing was simplified- the CPU just ran programs in a round-robin fashion, and didn't have to worry about pesky things like user inputs. Essentially, it was really just a batch processing system with a multi-user front-end. The designers of Alpha wanted to support full multiprogramming, instead of this hybrid-ish model. But they also needed to support traditional batch processing, as well as real-time execution. So the team split up to build the components of the \"Multi-Programming Executive\" module, which would allow all of these features. The Alpha, which was still 16-bit, didn't have the luxurious 4MB of RAM- it had 128kB. The MPE used much more memory than 128kB. This led to a massive crunch as the programmers worked to shrink MPE into something usable, while marketing looked at the deadlines and said, \"We were supposed to be selling this thing months ago!\" The result was a massive war between engineering and marketing, where marketing gave customers promises about what the performance would be, engineering told marketing what the actual performance would be (significantly worse than what marketing was promising), and then management would demand engineering \"prove\" that marketing's over-promises could be met. The initial ship-date was November, 1972, and by god, they shipped on time. Nothing actually worked, but they shipped. The first computer out the door was returned almost immediately. It could only handle two simultaneous users before slowing to a crawl, and crashed every ten minutes. By December, HP had gotten that to \"crashes every two hours\". They kept shipping machines even as they had to cut features and reliability promises. Those frequent crashes also concealed another bug: after running for 24 days, the HP3000's clock would overflow (2^31 milliseconds) and the clock would magically reverse by 25 days. As one sysop of a purchased HP3000 put it: \"The original designers of MPE never thought the OS would stay up for 25+ days in a row\". After a bunch of management shuffling, the titular Packard of Hewlett Packard sent a memo: production was stopping and all sold computers were being recalled. Customers were offered HP2000s in its place, or they could wait until fall 1973 for a revised version- that would only support 4-6 users, far fewer than marketing's initial promises of 64. This pleased no one, and it's reported that some customers cried over the disappointment. With sales paused, the entire computer underwent a design overhaul. The resulting machine was faster and cheaper and could actually handle 8 simultaneous users. One year after the botched launch, the HP3000 went back on the market, and ended up being a full success. It was so successful, HP continued supporting the HP3000 until 2010, which is where Janice enters our story. Circa 2006, she needed to update some Pascal code. That code used a lot of bit-masks to handle flags, which is normally a pretty easy function in Pascal- the language has a standard set of bitwise operations. So Janice was surprised to see: FUNCTION BITON(A , B : INTEGER): BOOLEAN; VAR C : INTEGER; BEGIN CASE A OF 15 : C:=1; 14 : C:=2; 13 : C:=4; 12 : C:=8; 11 : C:=16; 10 : C:=32; 9 : C:=64; 8 : C:=128; 7 : C:=256; 6 : C:=512; 5 : C:=1024; 4 : C:=2048; 3 : C:=4096; 2 : C:=8192; 1 : C:=16384; 0 : C:=32768; OTHERWISE BITON:=FALSE; END; IF ((B DIV C) MOD 2) = 1 THEN BITON:=TRUE ELSE BITON:=FALSE; END; FUNCTION SETBITON(A, B : INTEGER) : INTEGER; VAR C : INTEGER; BEGIN CASE A OF 15 : C:=1; 14 : C:=2; 13 : C:=4; 12 : C:=8; 11 : C:=16; 10 : C:=32; 9 : C:=64; 8 : C:=128; 7 : C:=256; 6 : C:=512; 5 : C:=1024; 4 : C:=2048; 3 : C:=4096; 2 : C:=8192; 1 : C:=16384; 0 : C:=32768; OTHERWISE C:=0; END; IF NOT BITON(A,B) THEN SETBITON:=B + C ELSE SETBITON:=B; END; FUNCTION SETBITOFF(A, B : INTEGER) : INTEGER; VAR C : INTEGER; BEGIN CASE A OF 15 : C:=1; 14 : C:=2; 13 : C:=4; 12 : C:=8; 11 : C:=16; 10 : C:=32; 9 : C:=64; 8 : C:=128; 7 : C:=256; 6 : C:=512; 5 : C:=1024; 4 : C:=2048; 3 : C:=4096; 2 : C:=8192; 1 : C:=16384; 0 : C:=32768; OTHERWISE C:=0; END; IF BITON(A,B) THEN SETBITOFF:=B - C ELSE SETBITOFF:=B; END; FUNCTION LAND(A,B : INTEGER) : INTEGER; VAR I : INTEGER; BEGIN I:=0; REPEAT IF BITON(I,A) THEN IF BITON(I,B) THEN A:=SETBITON(I,A) ELSE A:=SETBITOFF(I,A) ELSE A:=SETBITOFF(I,A); I:=I + 1; UNTIL I \u003e 15; LAND:=A; END; This is a set of hand-reinvented bitwise operations, culminating in an LAND, which does a bitwise and (not a logical and, which makes it annoyingly misnamed). I wouldn't call the code a horrible approach to doing this, even if it's definitely an inefficient approach (and when you're running a 33 year old computer, efficiency matters), but absent built-in bitwise operations, I can't see a lot of other options. The biggest problem is that LAND will set bits on that are already on, which is unnecessary- an AND should really only ever turn bits off. Which, as it turns out, is the root WTF. The developer responsible wasn't ignorant about bitwise operations. The version of Pascal that shipped on the HP3000 simply didn't have any. No and, or, not, or xor. Not even a shift-left or shift-right operation. In any case, this is what happens when I start doing research on a story and end up getting sucked down a rabbit hole. As always, while Wikipedia's true value is as a bibliography. A lot of those links have much more detail, but I hope this quick overview was an interesting story.
