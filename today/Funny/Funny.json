    "description": "Job interviews are one of the most nerve-wracking first-world experiences anyone can be a part of. As humans, we must work for a living, and working for a living means needing a job, and needing a job means needing to interview for that job. In the current job market, it's difficult to land an interview in the first place, let alone do well enough in the interview to be asked back by the prospective employer. In a perfect world, job seekers would have the upperhand when it comes to landing a job… but this isn't a perfect world—it's a world that belongs to corporate companies and their entitled ways.In this next story, a job seeker is humiliated for having a PhD by their military veteran interviewer, after having two prior interview rounds for the role. Not only did the interviewer call their PhD \"worthless\", but they also claimed a high schooler could get the open job done. Maybe they should do that instead of berating innocent job seekers…",

However, it comes back again when you long to become a grandparent. We see this all the time when older parents apply pressure to their adult kids, demanding for grandchildren at some point in the not-so-distant future. But what happens when you've been estranged from your parents for several years (in this case, decades) and they start coming out of the woodwork wanting grandchildren? Keep scrolling below for this tale of a new mom and her estranged parent.",

    "description": "One thing that will always continue to baffle us, no matter how many times we write about it, is people abandoning their cats. We cannot fathom doing that. Doing something like that is simply beyond our comprehension. But some people do it. Some people give away one of the best things about their lives without a single care in the world. But you know what that means? That means that more people have a chance of adopting these ameowzing cats. Which is exactly the attitude that the person in this story has. Their neighbors abandoned this cat, and unfathomable as it was, when the abandoned cat ran into this person's house, they saw it as the blessing that it was. And just like that, the abandoned kitty had a new home. A better home. We know for a fact that it is a better one. Because no good home could throw our a feline so lovely the way that they did. The cat made its choice, and it did it quickly.",

As the kids say these days, we're cooking over here, and have we brewed up a silly serving of cat comedy in the most purrfectly delectable of fashions. And by that, we of course mean memes. We sat down today and pawsitively pondered on this one thought: How can we make you all laugh your tails off today? It's Wednesday, meaning that you're in the middle of your mid-week slump and need some funny feline energy to get you back on your toe beans and finish off the week with a smile on your face.So, we sat, and we cooked, and cooked, and cooked, until we came up with this hissterical list of feline funnies that we just couldn't resist sharing. What's the point of spending so much time cooking if you're not going to eat and share it with others? So get ready to dig in because this feline feast of memes isn't going to consume itself. Have a great rest of your week!",

    "description": "Once upon a time, Ryan's company didn't use a modern logging framework to alert admins when services failed. No, they used everyone's favorite communications format, circa 2005: email. Can't reach the database? Send an email. Unhandled exception? Send an email. Handled exception? Better send an email, just in case. Sometimes they go to admins, sometimes they just go to an inbox used for logging. Let's look at how that worked. public void SendEMail(String receivers, String subject, String body) { try { System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient clnt = new System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"SmtpServer\"]); clnt.Send(new System.Net.Mail.MailMessage( ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"Sender\"], ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"Receivers\"], subject, body)); } catch (Exception ex) { SendEMail( ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"ErrorLogAddress\"], \"An error has occurred while sending an email\", ex.Message + \"\\n\" + ex.StackTrace); } } They use the Dot Net SmtpClient class to connect to an SMTP server and send emails based on the configuration. So far so good, but what happens when we can't send an email because the email server is down? We'll get an exception, and what do we do with it? The same thing we do with every other exception: send an email. Ryan writes: Strangely enough, I've never heard of the service crashing or hanging. We must have a very good mail server!

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/spaced-out-prefix",
    "description": "Alex had the misfortune to work on the kind of application which has forms with gigantic piles of fields, stuffed haphazardly into objects. A single form could easily have fifty or sixty fields for the user to interact with. That leads to C# code like this: private static String getPrefix(AV_Suchfilter filter) { String pr = String.Empty; try { int maxLength = 0; if (filter.Angebots_id != null) { maxLength = getmaxLength(maxLength, AV_MessagesTexte.Reportliste_sf_angebotsID.Length); } if (filter.InternesKennzeichen != null) { if (filter.InternesKennzeichen.Trim() != String.Empty) { maxLength = getmaxLength(maxLength, AV_MessagesTexte.Reportliste_sf_internesKennzeichen.Length); } } if (filter.Angebotsverantwortlicher_guid != null) { maxLength = getmaxLength(maxLength, AV_MessagesTexte.Reportliste_sf_angebotsverantwortlicher.Length); } // Do this another 50 times.... // and then .... int counter = 0; while (counter \u003c maxLength) { pr += \" \"; counter++; } } catch (Exception error) { ErrorForm frm = new ErrorForm(error); frm.ShowDialog(); } return pr; } The \"Do this another 50 times\" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in here. What really infuriates me about it, though, which we can see here, is that not all of the fields we're looking at are parameters to this function. And because the function here is static, they're not instance members either. I assume AV_MessagesTexte is basically a global of text labels, which isn't a bad way to manage such a thing, but functions should still take those globals as parameters so you can test them. I'm kidding, of course. This function has never been tested. Aside from a gigantic pile of string length comparisons, what does this function actually do? Well, it returns a new string which is a number of spaces exactly equal to the length of the longest string. And the way we build that output string is not only through string concatenation, but the use of a while loop where a for loop makes more sense. Also, just… why? Why do we need a spaces-only-string the length of another string? Even if we're trying to do some sort of text layout, that seems like a bad way to do whatever it is we're doing, and also if that's the case, why is it called getPrefix? WHY IS OUR PREFIX A STRING OF SPACES THE LENGTH OF OUR FIELD? HOW IS THAT A PREFIX? I feel like I'm going mad. But the real star of this horrible mess, in my opinion, is the exception handling. Get an exception? Show the user a form! There's no attempt to decide if or how we could recover from this error, we just annoy the user with it. Which isn't just unique to this function. Notice the getmaxLength function? It's really a max and it looks like this: private static int getmaxLength(int old, int current) { int result = old; try { if (current \u003e old) { result = current; } } catch (Exception error) { ErrorForm frm = new ErrorForm(error); frm.ShowDialog(); } return result; } What's especially delightful here is that this function couldn't possibly throw an exception. And you know what that tells me? This try/catch/form pattern is just their default error handling. They spam this everywhere, in every function, and the tech lead or architect pats themselves on the back for ensuring that the application \"never crashes!\" all the while annoying the users with messages they can't do anything about. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.
