    "description": "This caller decided to talk to a customer service rep, and tell them exactly what was on her mind. Too bad for her: she's now \"canceled\" by that company!They say it costs nothing to be kind, and that's mostly true. Having patience or politeness can be difficult if you're in a bad mood. A lot of people who have to call customer service are already in a bad state of mind, since they're presumably calling to clear up an issue. These customers sometimes like to insult the call workers. It's as if they're just calling in to blow off steam and have someone to belittle! If they'd just stated their issue to the call center rep, they'd be off the phone in no time. But some customers think that if their problem can't be instantly resolved, it's time to raise their voices and start hollering. At least at some workplaces, the employees aren't required to talk to customers who berate them or use inappropriate language. I wish I could've seen the look on this woman's face when she realized that not only do her actions have consequences, but that she had embarrassed herself in front of the employee she was targeting.

    "description": "The worst part about traveling during the holiday season is having to deal with other travelers. Whether it's a bus, train, or plane, having to share a confined space with strangers just so you can endure passive-aggressive meals with family members you love to avoid year-round often feels like a lot of effort for very little reward. However, that's what happens to countless folks every December, which means that nearly every traveler is at least slightly annoyed already. Here, we have one of those passengers who boarded his flight home, only to discover an entitled Karen sitting in his seat. Of course, she was assigned the middle seat on a 100% full, 3+ hour flight, and she genuinely thought this guy would be willing to switch with her. Thankfully, he had enough sense to stand up for himself, an act of defiance that led to a full 10 minutes of drama involving the flight attendant and several onlookers.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.

The single brain cell has successfully landed in the head of another orange cat. \"Bing\"! Now this orange cat will be exactly one brain cell smarter than he was before. Not that it's that much more, because all the orange cats share a single brain cell, being transferred to each of them on their turn. But with this orange brain cell, the current orange cat could have… the brain function of a single brain cell capacity! Hooray!Because all orange cats share this one brain cell, they exhibit a specific orange cat behavior. Try as they might, they all behave in a very orange way. And what better way is there to explain the orange cats' behavior than the best orange cat memes of 2024? Orange cats might have tried to get smarter in 2024, but they only got oranger. Maybe 2025 will be their year?",
