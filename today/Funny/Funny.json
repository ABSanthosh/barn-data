    "description": "Ugh, landlords… They often uphold a maddening double standard with their tenants. If you, the tenant, have a leaking roof or a broken heater, the landlord will probably take their sweet time fixing it. It could take days, weeks, or even months in some cases, just to get your apartment up to it's usual standards. But if your landlord needs something from you, like your monthly rent payment, they'd better have it on time or they'll throw a fit! This person's landlady is not respecting their time at all. While this person is trying to go about their day, the landlady keeps knocking on the door to show off the apartment to potential renters. Naturally, it's quite disruptive to have someone coming over to your apartment constantly. And the apartment also needs to be squeaky clean each time someone comes to view it, which adds additional pressure onto the tenant. Keep scrolling down below to read this person's full story of how they set some boundaries with their landlady. She wanted to learn the hard way, well, so be it! At least the tenant is almost done with their lease, and onto a better living situation. Up next, read about the managers who got to tell off their most entitled customers.",

    "description": "Not everyone was born to be a baker. The truth is that when it comes to cakes, cookies, and all forms of dessert, there are two types of people: bakers and eaters. A chosen few may fall into both categories, but we should all be honest with ourselves and our relationships to dessert. Personally speaking, I am an eater. In fact, my sweet tooth has been the source of many an unfortunate evening involving late-night calls to fast-food restaurants and bakeries that I'd like to pretend never happened. Still, as much as I love all forms of cookies, I am keenly aware of what my limitations are. As someone who spent the better part of 2024 trying to cook healthier dinners for myself beyond a bowl of pasta with store-bought pesto, I cannot fathom taking on baking as a new hobby. Firstly, because as much as I appreciate a freshly baked cookie, I simply do not have the patience and attention to detail to be a good baker. Second of all, and more importantly, if I suddenly became a good baker, my physical health would plummet even more than it already has. At least now, my bank account can stop me from making another late-night delivery order. One has to maintain some boundaries in this world.Keep scrolling below for these Redditors' biggest baking mishaps from the past year.

We've spent years building up our I Can Has Cheezburger family, slowly connecting all of the meme lovers from the cat community from across the interwebz to make a wholesome, hissterical, and purrfeclty pawesome group that is full of pawsitivity and LOLs. We've shared your homemade cat memes every week this year, and now it's time for us to round up the best of the best and take one last laugh at 2024 before we get into 2025.Grumpy Cat has nothing on you guys - some of these memes are the most fluffing funny we've ever seen (and trust us, we've seen a lot of cat memes). Move over Smudge, there are some new meme wizards in town and they're ready to pounce all over the competition with a claw full of comedy. It was nearly impawssible to pick the best out of a year's worth of memes, so we settled on a very reasonable number…50! Thank you so much from us at the I Can Has Cheezburger office. We LOLed a lot this year thanks to you, and here's to another year of LOLs and love!",

    "description": "Phil's company hired a contractor. It was the typical overseas arrangement: bundle up a pile of work, send it off to another timezone, receive back terrible code, push back during code review, then the whole thing blows up when the contracting company pushes back about how while the code review is in the contract if you're going to be such sticklers about it, they'll never deliver, and then management steps in and says, \"Just keep the code review to style comments,\" and then it ends up not mattering anyway because the contractor assigned to the contract leaves for another contracting company, and management opts to use the remaining billable hours for a new feature instead of finishing the inflight work, so you inherit a half-finished pile of trash and somehow have to make it work. Like I said, pretty standard stuff. Phil found this construct scattered all over the codebase: if cond1 and cond2: pass elif cond1 or cond2: # do actual work I hesitate to post this, because what we're looking at is just an attempt at doing a xor operation. And it's not wrong- it's an if statement way of writing (not a and b) or (a and not b). And if we're being nit-picky, while Python has a xor operator, it's technically a bitwise xor, so I could see someone not connecting that they could use it in this case- cond1 ^ cond2 would work just fine, so long as both conditions are actual booleans. But Python often uses non-boolean comparisons, like: text = \"\" if text: print(\"This won't print.\") This is playing with truthiness, and the problem here is that you can't use a xor to chain these conditions together. if text ^ otherText: # do stuff That's a runtime error, as the ^ is only defined for integral types. You'd have to write: if bool(text) ^ bool(otherText): # do stuff So, would it have been better to use one of the logical equivalences for xor? Certainly. Would it have been even better to turn that equivalence into a function so you could actually call a xor function? Absolutely. But I also can't complain too much about this one. I hate it, don't get me wrong, but it's not a trainwreck. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.
