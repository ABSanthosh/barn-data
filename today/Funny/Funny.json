    "description": "Divorce is not fun. When you see those \"divorce parties\" where people are celebrating their divorce, know that before it got to that point, it was devastatingly disastrous and stressful. It's a break-up, but with a lot more baggage to figure out. It is heartache with so many other aches—financial, societal, and more. So even when someone seems relieved, excited, and/or happy about their divorce, don't forget the most-likely long and strenuous process they went through before getting to that state.  A lot of reasons for a divorce is co-dependency, so once you start going through the process of the split, the individual needs to start working on setting up their own life, sans ex-spouse. In the case of this Redditor, she was creating herself some financial stability and making her own friends while going through her divorce. She was still cohabiting  with her ex at the time, because the divorce wasn't finalized, and needed any excuse to stay out of the house. So, she was working overtime and hanging out with a new friend she made at work. She was very excited to make a close girlfriend, because she needed that kind of energy and support during a her divorce. Unfortunately, it didn't play out as she thought it would…",

    "description": "When exactly does babysitting become parenting? Or is it the reverse? That's the question that this parent is grappling with, since her son's stepmother thinks she's \"babysitting\" too much!Many parents bristle at the word \"babysitting\" when it's used for the child's parents. For example, it's rather old-fashioned now, but there was a time when people might spot a father out with his kids and ask if he was \"babysitting\" for his wife. No… he's parenting his own children! Babysitting implies that it's a job that you do for a set amount of time, receive payment for, and then leave. So when you're parenting a child, you're a parent all the time… right? It's a question that can be confusing and awkward when stepparents get involved. Some stepparents are too overbearing, and try to force their kids into hanging out with them, leading those kids be resentful. Other times, the stepparent doesn't really like the children at all. They fall in love with their partner, then roll their eyes at the partner's kids. But if you're spending all your time with that partner and building a future together, it's not like you can just ignore their kid! It's a huge part of a parent's life. After that, read about some unforgettably bad job interviews, like on person who 'interviewed someone who... technically wasn't allowed to be in the building.'",

    "description": "Hey there, cat lovers and feline enthusiasts! Today, we are taking a journey through the whimsical world of the liquid-to-solid spectrum, with extra emphasis on the feline experience. Cats are amazingly able to defy the laws of physics and transform into puddles—or whatever shape they need to take to get from point A to point B—blurring the boundaries of feline physics with their liquid-solid spectrum antics. We've got to give it up for cats. Their flexibility is simply inspiring. We humans struggle to merely bend over to tie our shoes.One such liquid feline has mastered the art of sneaking into his neighbor's house. Well, it's not so much \"sneaking\" because he does it with no shame at all, in broad daylight. Because he does not give a hoot about what his neighbor thinks about these guest appearances, as far as the cat is concerned, he is the true owner of his neighbor's house. The neighbor should really be thanking Mr. Liquid Cat for allowing him to continue residing in Mr. Cat's part-time home. Read on for all the details!",

There is just something so meowgical about these majestic fluffy felines. They are more like living room lions than they are cats, but snuggly ones. We have definitely seen some noticeable differences between this awwdorable Maine Coon kitten and our previous kittens, like fur example, this kitten is very active. Like, hyperactive. He always wants to play…all the time.Since we've got Maine Coons on our mind, we thought it would be nice to collect a stunning series of marvelously meowjestic and regal Maine Coon cats, but in their giant kitten form. Yes, they are even large as kittens. He barely fits in two hands…and he's only a few months old! Scroll down to see these purrfect pictures of pawdorable cats, you know you can't resist floofy kittens. At least, we can't!",

We had not yet arrived at the era of a Resident Evil, where the game Resident Evil begins by literally saying the words \"Resident Evil\" out loud.

    "description": "I'm a JSON curmudgeon, in that I think that its type-system, inherited from JavaScript, is bad. It's a limited vocabulary of types, and it forces developers to play odd games of convention. For example, because it lacks any sort of date type, you either have to explode your date out as a sub-dictionary (arguably, the \"right\" approach) or do what most people do- use an ISO formatted string as your date. The latter version requires you to attempt to parse the sting to validate the data, but validating JSON is a whole thing anyway. But, enough about me being old and cranky. Do you know one type JSON supports? Boolean values. Which is why this specification from today's anonymous submitter annoys me so much: field: sw_auto_update type: string valid values: /(on)|(off)/ field: data_auto_update type: string valid values: /(on)|(off)/ field: spanning_tree_protocol type: string valid values: /(on)|(off)/ Their custom validator absolutely requires the use of strings, and absolutely requires that they have these values. Sending a boolean, or worse, the string \"true\" causes the request to get rejected. Our submitter doesn't explain why it's this way, but I have a strong suspicion that it's because it was originally designed to support a form submission with radio buttons. The form is long gone, but the API contract remains. [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod. Restrict NuGet feed privileges with ProGet. Learn more.",

    "description": "Today's anonymous submitter spent a few weeks feeling pretty good about themselves. You see, they'd inherited a gigantic and complex pile of code, an application spread out across 15 backend servers, theoretically organized into \"modules\" and \"microservices\" but in reality was a big ball of mud. And after a long and arduous process, they'd dug through that ball of mud and managed to delete 190 files, totaling 30,000 lines of code. That was fully 2/3rds of the total codebase, gone- and yet the tests continued to pass, the application continued to run, and everyone was just much happier with it. Two weeks later, a new ticket comes in: users are getting a 403 error when trying to access the \"User Update\" screen. Our submitter has seen a lot of these tickets, and it almost always means that the user's permissions are misconfigured. It's an easy fix, and not a code problem. Just to be on the safe side, though, they pull up the screen with their account- guaranteed to have the right permissions- and get a 403. As you can imagine, the temptation to sneak a few fixes in alongside this massive refactoring was impossible to resist. One of the problems was that most of their routes were camelCase URLs, but userupdate was not. So they'd fixed it. It was a minor change, and it worked in testing. So what was happening? Well, there was a legacy authorization database. It was one of those 15 backend servers, and it ran no web code, and thus wasn't touched by our submitter's refactoring. Despite their web layer having copious authorization and authentication code, someone had decided back in the olden days, to implement that authorization and authentication in its own database. Not every request went through this database. It impacted new sessions, but only under specific conditions. But this database had a table in it, which listed off all the routes. And unlike the web code, which used regular expressions for checking routes, and were case insensitive, this database did a strict equality comparison. The fix was simple: update the table to allow userUpdate. But it also pointed towards a deeper, meaner target for future refactoring: dealing with this sometimes required (but often not!) authentication step lurking in a database that no one had thought about until our submitter's refactoring broke something.
