    "description": "Misha has a co-worker who has unusual ideas about how database performance works. This co-worker, Ted, has a vague understanding that a SQL query optimizer will attempt to find the best execution path for a given query. Unfortunately, Ted has just enough knowledge to be dangerous; he believes that the job of a developer is to write SQL queries that will \"trick\" the optimizer into doing an even better job, somehow. This means that Ted loves subqueries. For example, let's say you had a table called tbl_updater, which is used to store pending changes for a batch operation that will later get applied. Each change in updater has a unique change key that identifies it. For reasons best not looked into too deeply, at some point in the lifecycle of a record in this table, the application needs to null out several key fields based on the change value. If you or I were writing this, we might do something like this: update tbl_updater set id = null, date = null, location = null, type = null, type_id = null where change = @change And this is how you know that you and I are fools, because we didn't use a single subquery. update tbl_updater set id = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) update tbl_updater set date = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) update tbl_updater set location = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) update tbl_updater set type = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) update tbl_updater set date = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) update tbl_updater set type_id = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) So here, Ted uses where updater in (subquery) which is certainly annoying and awkward, given that we know that change is a unique key. Maybe Ted didn't know that? Of course, one of the great powers of relational databases is that they offer data dictionaries so you can review the structure of tables before writing queries, so it's very easy to find out that the key is unique. But that simple ignorance doesn't explain why Ted broke it out into multiple updates. If insanity is doing the same thing again and again expecting different results, what does it mean when you actually do get different results but also could have just done all this once? Misha asked Ted why he took this approach. \"It's faster,\" he replied. When Misha showed benchmarks that proved it emphatically wasn't faster, he just shook his head. \"It's still faster this way.\" Faster than what? Misha wondered.

    "description": "Carlos and Claire found themselves supporting a 3rd party logistics package, called IniFreight. Like most \"enterprise\" software, it was expensive, unreliable, and incredibly complicated. It had also been owned by four different companies during the time Carlos had supported it, as its various owners underwent a series of acquisitions. It kept them busy, which is better than being bored. One day, Claire asked Carlos, \"In SQL, what does an exclamation point mean?\" \"Like, as a negation? I don't think most SQL dialects support that.\" \"No, like-\" and Claire showed him the query. select * from valuation where origin_country \u003c '!' \"IniFreight, I presume?\" Carlos asked. \"Yeah. I assume this means, 'where origin country isn't blank?' But why not just check for NOT NULL?\" The why was easy to answer: origin_country had a constraint which prohibited nulls. But the input field didn't do a trim, so the field did allow whitespace only strings. The ! is the first printable, non-whitespace character in ASCII (which is what their database was using, because it was built before \"support wide character sets\" was a common desire). Unfortunately, this means that my micronation, which is simply spelled with the ASCII character 0x07 will never show up in their database. You might not think you're familiar with my country, but trust me- it'll ring a bell. [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.

One Redditor found a fun little hack to get the job—and it involves roasting the CEO. Yup, you heard that correct. The guy doesn't suggest doing this any change you get, but he does encourage being completely honest during an interview. Still try to be as professional and diplomatic as possible. But if they're serving you bs, you should probably let the chef know, ya know? This guy really let the company he was interviewing for have it after he got asked the infamous question, \"Where do you see yourself in five years?\" A generic question that, honestly, no company really has any business asking. Like, they're interview for the job, that should be enough proof that this person wants to work here…",

    "description": "Is it just me, or dinners with bosses are something we used to see quite a lot in old TV shows and movies? It's not a strange concept for a boss and their spouse to invite a new hire over to their house for a get-to-know-each-other dinner. It sounds completely reasonable to me. That being said, if my boss were to ever invite me over to dinner at his house, I would probably look at him as if he had just grown three heads. Not only would the offer sound bizarre coming from him, but I legitimately do not want to spend three hours in a strange house, awkwardly making small talk with my boss and his spouse, whom I have never met. We do enough bonding in the office; there is no need to involve our personal lives as well. But what can you do if the boss invites you over? It's not like you can actually tell them no… Getting an offer like this from the boss is not something anyone can ignore, which leads employees like the one in the story below into a spiral.",

Again, if you set the play back speed to 0.25 you approach something like real time but it’s important to note that it only records when I make a stroke so you don’t have all my pauses. While I’m drawing I’m also watching a show, pausing to think about what I’m gonna draw, talking with my kids as they come in and out, messing up and getting mad at myself, eating some lunch, and all that good stuff. This might make it look like I sit down and power through a comic without hesitation and with supreme confidence but I assure you that is not the case unless I am drawing live on stage at PAX.",
