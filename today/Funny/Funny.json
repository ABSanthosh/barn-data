    "description": "Being an intern is a humbling experience. When I was in high school, I landed an internship at a fashion magazine and thought I was living the Devil Wears Prada dream. In reality, I was just free labor for a struggling startup that needed all the help and exposure it could get. You'd think by 2025, unpaid internships would be a thing of the past, but nope. Somehow, they still exist. On the flip side, if you've ever supervised interns, sometimes you're glad they're unpaid. The amount of lingering, excessive questions, and straight-up entitlement some college kids have these days is mind-blowing. You'll give them a simple task, and suddenly, it turns into an existential crisis. Of course, not all interns are bad, but some of them could use a little humbling. Whether you're an unpaid intern or dealing with one, these memes are for you.",

    "description": "We cannot stress this enough–employment is a two-way street. Both job candidates and hiring managers should go about the job-hunting process with that in mind. Both of them should be considered the interviewers, especially since the position should fit both sides, not just one. This directly means that if hiring managers cannot treat their candidates with the respect they deserve, they should not be hiring anyone in the first place.Unfortunately, just as interviewers find themselves meeting with many candidates who do not fit the company, job seekers also end up meeting with a lot of companies that do not fit them. You can go through hundreds of job interviews before you find the right one for you, including some interviews that are less than respectful, to say the least.The job candidate in the story down below experienced this recently, when they got to their job interview only to find out the interviewer was not there. The company thought it was no big deal that the candidate came all this way only to be told they will reschedule the interview.",

You turn away for one second, and suddenly, your cats will lock you out of your own bathroom. You turn away for another second, and before you know it, your cat will have stolen food right off your plate. Your cats will go out of their way to drive you crazy, because it's fun for them. At least we think so. Otherwise, why would they be doing these things so often?Cats are causing all of this chaos to remind us who the actual boss of the house is, and it would be good for us to remember. If just knew it in advance, if we caved into their demands, if we could simply read their little kitty cat minds and give them everything that they want every second of every day, then they would stop with the madness. But until that day… the chaos continues, and we have to do what these cat owners did and come up with as many creative solutions to our problems as we can.",

When you have a meowdel as beautiful (or handsome) and as silly as your cat, you can't not take pictures of them. It's purractically against the law. You take pictures of them when they're sleeping soundly, when they wake up and make a funny face, when they clumsily fall off the couch, when they make that \"please, just one little treato\" face…the list goes on, and on, and on…and on! The only thing we love as much as taking pictures of our cute cats is looking at pictures of other people's cute cats! Cats are just too awwdorable to not look at, especially when one cat owner makes a call to the interwebz asking for all the purrfect pawparazzi parents to share their best cat photo. Below you'll find not only the funniest feline pictures, but also some sweet and wholesome ones as well. All thanks to the meowgic of our feline friends (and their pawrents with iPhones). Enjoy!",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/device-detection",
    "description": "There are a lot of cases where the submission is \"this was server side generated JavaScript and they were loading constants\". Which, honestly, is a WTF, but it isn't interesting code. Things like this: if (false === true) { // do stuff } That's absolutely the wrong way to do that, and I hate it, but there's just so many times you can say, \"send server-side values to the client as an object, not inline\". But Daniel's electrical provider decided to come up with an example of this that really takes it to the next level of grossness. var isMobile = \"\" === \"true\"; var isAndroid = \"\" === \"true\"; var isIPad = \"\" === \"true\"; var isIPhone = \"\" === \"true\"; For starters, they're doing device detection on the server side, which isn't the worst possible idea, but it means they're relying on header fields or worse: the user agent string. Maybe they're checking the device resolution. The fact that they're naming specific devices instead of browser capabilities hints at a terrible hackjob of reactive webdesign- likely someone wrote a bunch of JavaScript that alters the desktop stylesheet to cram the desktop site onto a mobile device. But that's just background noise. Look at that code. First, we've got some lovely order-of-operations abuse: === has higher precedence than =, which makes sense but hardly makes this code readable. The first time I saw this, my brain wanted the assignment to happen first. But what's really special to me is the insistence on making this stringly typed. They control both sides of the code, so they could have just done booleans on both sides. And sure, there's a world where they're just dumb, or didn't trust their templating engine to handle that well. I've seen enough bad code, though, to have a different suspicion. I can't confirm it, but c'mon, you know in your hearts this is true: the function which is doing device detection returns a string itself, and that string isn't always a boolean for some reason. So they needed to wrap the output in quotes, because that was the only way to make sure that the JavaScript actually could be executed without a syntax error. I can't be sure that's true from this little snippet. But look at this code, and tell me that someone didn't make that mistake. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.

    "description": "Just because you get fired doesn't mean that your pull requests are automatically closed. Dallin was in the middle of reviewing a PR by Steve when the email came out announcing that Steve no longer worked at the company. Let's take a look at that PR, and maybe we can see why. $originalUndrawn = DecimalHelper::toDecimal($party-\u003elimit)-\u003esub(DecimalHelper::toDecimal($party-\u003edrawn)); This is the original code, which represents operations on investments. An investment is represented by a note, and belongs to one or more partys. The amount that can be drawn is set by a limit, which can belong to either the party or the note. What our developer was tasked with doing was allow a note to have no limit. This means changing all the places where the note's limit is checked. So this is what they submitted: if ($note-\u003elimit == null) { $originalUndrawn = DecimalHelper::toDecimal($party-\u003elimit)-\u003esub(DecimalHelper::toDecimal($party-\u003edrawn)); } else { $originalUndrawn = DecimalHelper::toDecimal($party-\u003elimit)-\u003esub(DecimalHelper::toDecimal($party-\u003edrawn)); } You'll note here that the note limit isn't part of calculating the party limits, so both branches do the same thing. And then there's the deeper question of \"is a null really the best way to represent this?\" especially given that elsewhere in the code they have an \"unlimited\" flag that disables limit checking. Now, Steve wasn't let go only for their code- they were just a miserable co-worker who liked to pick fights in pull request comments. So the real highlight of Steve's dismissal was that Dallin got to have a meaningful discussion about the best way to make this change with the rest of the team, and Steve didn't have a chance to disrupt it.
