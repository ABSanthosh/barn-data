    "description": "Being a property owner has many perks, one of which, is that you can do whatever the heck you want on your own land–it's yours. This avid hunter in our next story owned 7 acres just outside of town where all the local game walked through, making it a primo spot for at-home hobby hunting. However, with that nice of a setup, the neighbors were bound to get a little jealous. Like a binoculared Kevin claiming to be the neighborhood watch, the guy next door started turning green over the property adjacent to his. He wanted to hunt there just like his neighbor, so, being the entitled guy he was, he assumed it was his prerogative to take claim over his neighbor's property surveillance.Big mistake, buddy. Keep reading for all the details of this property dispute that might just persuade this father-in-law to build a 20ft wall on his neighbor's side of the property, preventing wildlife from ever walking through his yard again.",

    "description": "Job hunting today is no joke. It's an endless cycle of sifting through job boards, tailoring your resume for each position, and pouring your heart and soul into cover letters—all for the privilege of hearing nothing back 90% of the time. When I was looking for my last job, it took eight agonizing months. I probably applied to over 100 jobs, each one feeling like a shot in the dark (which they were).And then comes the interview process, which is way worse. It's an unnecessarily drawn-out game of endurance, usually with multiple rounds of interviews, tests, and follow-ups for the slim chance you'll land the role. Congratulations—you got the job! Now you get to work 9-5 for the rest of your life and probably still be underpaid.But the good news is, if you find yourself up against a job applicant like the one in this story, you've got nothing to worry about. Let's just say he's not exactly setting the bar high.",

He snuggles up next to you, in his fluffy feline fashion, sending one of his front legs towards you and paws you gently. Isn't that just the cutest, most wholesome thing a cat pawrent can expurrience? Just a smol touch of a cat's paw. It can change a day's mood, it can make any humble hooman happy for a long time. It's like a tiny imprint of bliss.We want to help any hooman experience this meowgnificent moment, even if they're not cat pawrents - so we turned to the next best thing, which is also so easy to transfer to any feline fan - cat memes.

To be fair, that's what we want to do every day, but especially on this cold, wintery Tuesday. If we could pick our purrfect cuddle puddle, it would be with a family of cheetahs. It would be like cuddling with a great dane, but better, because it would be a giant cat that meows and purrs. Just imagine how soft it would be. Just imagine purrs from a 120 lb. cat…it must be meowgical. Now, multiply that by three, and you've successfully managed to expurrience what the hooman guard in this video gets to enjoy every night. He guards a family of cheetahs at a wildlife reserve, and while sleeping under the stars, the large feline family snuck in for a cuddle puddle overnight, showcasing the heartwarming connections pawssible between hoomans and animals. We're not just awwwww-ing over this, we're also pawsitively jealous. Scroll down to watch the wholesome video below!",

For example, if you are A Russo Brother - either one - I would absolutely love it if they came back and made a cool Marvel movie. Disney certainly doesn't know how. Disney has been wandering in the fucking woods since Endgame, and the movie that called them out for doing exactly that made 1.3 billion dollars. I want these Russo gentlemen back because they made Captain America: Winter Soldier. That's why I wanted them to do the other stuff; because they make good things. I don't need some kind of substrate underneath it. It's a craft. They're the masters of it. That's plenty for me.",

    "description": "Roger took on a contract to fix up a PHP website. During the negotiations, he asked some questions about the design, like, \"Is it object-oriented or more procedural?\" \"No, it's PHP,\" said the developer. Which about sums it up, I suppose. Have some date handling code: function MnameToMnumber($mname) //takes month name 'January' and returns month number '01' { if($mname == 'January'){$mnum = '01';} elseif($mname == 'February'){$mnum = '02';} elseif($mname == 'March'){$mnum = '03';} elseif($mname == 'April'){$mnum = '04';} elseif($mname == 'May'){$mnum = '05';} elseif($mname == 'June'){$mnum = '06';} elseif($mname == 'July'){$mnum = '07';} elseif($mname == 'August'){$mnum = '08';} elseif($mname == 'September'){$mnum = '09';} elseif($mname == 'October'){$mnum = '10';} elseif($mname == 'November'){$mnum = '11';} elseif($mname == 'December'){$mnum = '12';} return $mnum; } function MnumberToMname($mname) //takes month number '01' and returns month name '01' { if($mnum= '01'){$mname = 'January';} elseif($mnum= '02'){$mname = 'February';} elseif($mnum= '03'){$mname = 'March';} elseif($mname == 'April'){$mnum = '04';} elseif($mnum= '05'){$mname = 'May';} elseif($mnum= '06'){$mname = 'June';} elseif($mnum= '07'){$mname = 'July';} elseif($mnum= '08'){$mname = 'August';} elseif($mnum= '09'){$mname = 'September';} elseif($mnum= '10'){$mname = 'October';} elseif($mnum= '11'){$mname = 'November';} elseif($mnum= '12'){$mname = 'December';} return $mname; } So, for starters, I \"love\" the use of Whitesmiths indenting. I don't think I've seen this in the wild. (I predict the comments section will be links to articles where I have seen this in the wild). Beyond that, there's nothing terribly surprising here, in terms of bad date handling code, with a few small exceptions. First is their insistence on the conversion itself being stringly typed: January isn't month 1, but \"01\". But more notable: MnumberToMname just doesn't work. They're using the assignment operator instead of the equality operator. At least, for all the cases where they're doing the correct comparison direction. A stray \"name to number\" conversion is lurking in April. Not that it matters- this will always return January. [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.
