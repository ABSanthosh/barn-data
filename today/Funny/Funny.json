    "description": "This couple is facing some major side-eyes after realizing they wouldn't have enough money to tip on their bill. No one can agree who's right and who's wrong here. If you only have $30 in the budget for food, and you spend about that much on your meal, well, now you're stuck. There's no room left to tip your server. Should someone in this situation be obligated to tip? Maybe someone with a very limited budget still deserves a nice night out… but there are also plenty of fast-casual restaurants that don't have servers, or a nice buffet where you serve yourself, or even just getting some fast food and taking your food to a nice park. You can always spruce up a meal, and you don't need to stiff your servers on tips in order to do so. Read this person's story below, and then read the numerous different responses from people who think they were wrong to people who think they actually did nothing wrong. Next up, read about this delivery courier who waited patiently for 100 minutes in order to maliciously comply: \"The time stamp was 3:03 so I was definitely not late.\"",

    "description": "There are some things that even the most mature 14-year-old should not be responsible for! This teenager was hoping to have a nice, relaxing, and playful summer vacation. After all, she had earned it after a difficult freshman year in high school! However, her 33-year-old sister, who recently became a mother just a few months prior, had other plans for the teenage sister.Before long, the 14-year-old was the baby's primary caretaker. When her sister went back to work, she found herself left alone with a 3-month-old, five days a week. Thankfully, nothing serious happened, but talk about negligence on behalf of the sister! Of course, childcare is expensive, and everyone needs to have grace and sympathy for parents who are trying to manage their careers and their family needs at once. However, 14-year-olds are simply ill-equipped to handle all the feeding, changing, tantrums, and more. Keep scrolling below to see what happened when the younger sister, who shared this story online, finally had enough of being on babysitting duty 247!",

    "description": "Ah, the story of the cat hater. We have heard many of those. People keep telling us that they hate cats, but we know the truth… We, real cat people, know that they simply have not met the right cat yet. Yes, it is that simple. Cats can win anyone over. We have seen it time and time again. We've seen dads who've hated cats their whole lives suddenly get adopted by a cat and fall in love with them. We have seen moms who hated cats fall in love with a single-braincelled orange kitten who stopped at absolutely nothing to make that happen. We've seen a boyfriend who hated cats go out of his way to save their girlfriend's cat when it got stuck in a cupboard, therefore forever losing his cat hater card. And today, another story. A girlfriend who hated cats - truly and honestly hated them - was won over. And all it took was the cat showing her a little real affection at a time when she needed it. Yes, it really is that easy.  Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

We woke up this morning with our cats littered around us like someone sprinkled sprinkles on a cupcake, and if you love cats as much as we do, that's the best way to wake up. It was so meowrvelous, in fact, that we had a lot of difficulty prying ourselves out of bed to go to work today. Well, we have a lot of trouble getting to work every day, but that's a story for a different day.The only thing that we knew would pawsitively bring us some happiness today would be the joy of scrolling through some fluffy feline funnies. If we must leave our cute cats at home for 8+ hours, we need to fill our kitty comedy quota with the help of cat memes filled with catnip comedy. Be warned, though - these memes are purrfectly addictive. You might not want to stop, but that's the whole point. There are enough silly kitties in the form of memes to keep you occupied until you get back to your purrfectly precious felines at home. Enjoy!Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver.

    "description": "A recent code-review on a new build pipeline got Sandra's attention (previously). The normally responsible and reliable developer responsible for the commit included this in their Jenkinsfile: sh ''' if ! command -v yamllint \u0026\u003e /dev/null; then if command -v apt-get \u0026\u003e /dev/null; then apt-get update \u0026\u0026 apt-get install -y yamllint elif command -v apk \u0026\u003e /dev/null; then apk add --no-cache yamllint elif command -v pip3 \u0026\u003e /dev/null; then pip3 install --break-system-packages yamllint fi fi find . -name '*.yaml' -exec yamllint {} \\\\; || true find . -name '*.yml' -exec yamllint {} \\\\; || true ''' So the goal of this script is to check to see if the yamllint command is available. If it isn't, we check if apt-get is available, and if it is, we use that to install yamllint. Failing that, we try apk, Alpine's package manager, and failing that we use pip3 to install it out of PyPI. Then we run it against any YAML files in the repo. There are a few problems with this approach. The first, Sandra notes, is that they don't use Alpine Linux, and thus there's no reason to try apk. The second is that this particular repository contains no Python components and thus pip is not available in the CI environment. Third, this CI job runs inside of a Docker image which already has yamllint installed. Now, you'd think the developer responsible would have known this, given that this very merge request also included the definition of the Dockerfile for this environment. They'd already installed yamllint in the image. Sandra writes: This kind of sloppiness is also wildly out of character for him, to the point where my first thought was that it was AI-generated - especially since this was far from the only WTF in the submitted Jenkinsfile. Thankfully, it didn't pass code review and was sent back for intensive rework. Finally, while the reality is that we'll always need to resolve some dependencies at build time, things like \"tooling\" and \"linters\" really belong in the definition of the build environment, not resolved at build time.

    "description": "Frederico planned to celebrate the new year with friends at the exotic international tourist haven of Molvania. When visiting the area, one could buy and use a MolvaPass (The Most Passive Way About Town!) for free or discounted access to cultural sites, public transit, and more. MolvaPasses were available for 3, 7, or 365 days, and could be bought in advance and activated later. Still outside the country the week before his trip, Frederico had the convenience of buying a pass either online or via an app. He elected to use the website, sitting down before his home PC and entering the address into his web browser. Despite his fiber internet connection, he sat on a white screen for several seconds while the GoMolva Tourist Board website loaded. He then clicked the obvious Buy Now button in the top-right corner. After several more seconds, he was presented with a page requiring him to create an account. Frederico did so, specifying his email address and a 16-character password suggested by Bitwarden. He then received a confirmation link in his email inbox. Upon clicking that, he was presented with an interface where he could add MolvaPasses to a shopping cart. He selected one 3-day pass and paid with PayPal. The website redirected him to the proper screen; he entered his PayPal credentials and confirmed the payment. From there, he was redirected to a completely white screen. After waiting several seconds, a minute ... nothing changed. PayPal sent him a receipt, but there was no confirmation from the GoMolva Tourist Board website. Frederico decided to refresh the page. This time, he saw the default Apache screen on CentOS. His jaw almost hit the floor. They were still using CentOS, despite the fact that it'd been abandoned? Horrified, he bailed on that tab, desperately opening a fresh one and manually entering the URL again. Finally, the page loaded successfully. Frederico was still logged in. From there, he browsed to the My Passes section. His 3-day MolvaPass was there, listed as Not activated. This was exactly what Frederico had hoped he would see. With a sigh of relief, he turned his attention away from his laptop to his phone. For the sake of convenience, he wanted to download the MolvaPass app onto his phone. Upon doing so, he opened it and entered his username and password on the initial screen. After clicking Login, the following message appeared: The maximum length of the password is 15 characters. Frederico's blood froze. How was that possible? There'd been no errors or warnings when he'd created his login. Everything had been fine then. Heart pounding, Frederico tried logging in again. The same error appeared. He switched back to his computer, where the site was still open. He browsed to My Account and selected Change Password. A new screen prompted him for the old password, and a new one twice. He hurriedly filled in the fields and clikced the Change Password button. A message appeared: Your MolvaPass has been successfully activated. \"What?!\" Frederico blurted out loud. There was nothing to click but an OK button. A follow-up message assured him, Password has been successfully changed. As terror bolted down his spine, an expletive flew from his mouth. He navigated back to My Passes. There beside his newly-purchased pass was the big green word Activated. \"I only changed the password!\" he pleaded out loud to a god who clearly wasn't listening. He forced a deep breath upon his panicked self and deliberated what to do from there. Support. Was there any way to get in touch with someone who could undo the activation or refund his money? With some Googling, Frederico found a toll-free number he could call from abroad. After he rapidly punched the number into his phone, a stilted robot voice guided him through a phone menu to the \"Support\" option. We're getting somewhere, Frederico reassured himself. \"FoR MoLvaPaSs suPpOrt, uSe ThE cOnTaCt FoRm oN tHe GoMoLvA WeBzOnE.\" The robot hung up. Frederico somehow refrained from hurling his phone across the room. Turning back to his PC, he scrolled down to the website footer, where he found a Contact us link. On this page, there was a contact form and an email address. Frederico filled out the contact form in detail and clicked the Submit button. A new message appeared: Unable to send the request, try again later. Frederico rolled his eyes toward the heavens. Somehow, he managed to wait a good five minutes before trying again—in vain. Desperately, he took his detailed message and emailed it to the support address, hoping for a quick response. Minutes crawled past. Hours. Nothing by the time Frederico went to bed. It wasn't until the next morning that a response came back. The entire message read: The MolvaPass should have been activated once you reached Molvania, not before. Consumed with soul-burning fury, Frederico hit Caps Lock on his keyboard. MAYBE MY PREVIOUS EMAIL WAS TOO LONG OR DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND?? ALL I DID WAS CHANGE THE PASSWORD!!!! Several hours later, the following reply: The change of pw is not related to the activation of the pass. Frederico directed his rage toward escalating the matter. He managed to track down the company that'd built the GoMolva website, writing to their support to demand a cancellation of the MolvaPass and a full refund. A few hours later, their reply asked for his PayPal transaction code so they could process the request. In the end, Frederico got his money back and resolved to wait until he was physically in Molvania before attempting to buy another MolvaPass. We can only hope he rang in the new year with sanity intact. [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod. Restrict NuGet feed privileges with ProGet. Learn more.",
