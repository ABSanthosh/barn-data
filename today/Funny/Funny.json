    "description": "Job interviews have the potential to make or break your job search. Sure, not getting to the next round of coffee chats and skill checks is a bummer. However, some particularly horrible interviews can break your spirit—and that, a job seeker cannot afford. You never realize how many strange, entitled individuals exist in the world until you venture out into the job market, bright-eyed and ready to prove yourself. Although, like the dirt on my favorite pair of ivory trainers, the grime of the job search can be wiped away once you realize what to look out for. Red flags are easy to recognize after you've had your hat in the ring for long enough. The employees in the thread below discuss the worst job interviews they've ever experienced—ones so bad they \"[ran] for the hills\". If you've had your fair share of strange, entitled interviewers, sound off in the comments. We'd love to read what other nonsensical behavior exists out there.",

After all, they have worked hard enough to own property and to be able to do whatever they want with it. Unfortunately, counties and HOAs can get in the way and ruin those simple joys.Here, we have a resident who was pressured into giving up 15' x 250' of property (that's 3,750 square feet, mind you!) to the county as part of a plan to extend a road in the neighborhood. I think it's fair to say that this dude held a grudge for over a year, one that would eventually win him that land back.",

    "description": "Adopting a cat is one of the most amazing experiences that anyone can have. We believe that, and we stand by that every day. Returning a lost cat to their previous owners, even after you think you have been chosen by a cat, is also an amazing experience. It's heartbreaking on one hand, of course, because so many of us wait so long to be chosen by our feline companions, but it's the right thing to do - it's putting a family back together. But what happens if you find out that the cat you have had and loved for years is actually microchipped and used to belong to someone else? What is the right thing to do then? That is exactly the dilemma that the person in today's story has to face. Now, credit where credit is due… they seem to be truly trying to find the previous owners, even though we don't know if they would be able to actually give the cat back. They're trying to do what they think is right. But they can't find the owner, and now, the fear that remains is that one day… that owner might come back, and they might have some words to say.",

But being cats, they have the superhooman ability to quickly evacuate the area in which they are about to face consequences and disappear into nothingness within the blink of an eye. But today we have gathered a group of clawminal cattos to make them face up to what they have done and live with the consequences of their actions.Whether or not they learn from the errors of their ways is a different discussion entirely, but one thing is for sure, we will finally get to see them face up to the crimes they have committed.",

    "description": "Do you know what I had forgotten until this morning? That VBScript (and thus, older versions of Visual Basic) don't require you to use parentheses when calling a function. Foo 5 and Foo(5) are the same thing. Of course, why would I remember that? I thankfully haven't touched any of those languages since about… 2012. Which is actually a horrifyingly short time ago, back when I supported classic ASP web apps. Even when I did, I always used parentheses because I wanted my code to be something close to readable. Classic ASP, there's a WTF for you. All the joy of the way PHP mixes markup and code into a single document, but with an arguably worse and weirder language. Which finally, brings us to Josh's code. Josh worked for a traveling exhibition company, and that company had an entirely homebrewed CMS written in classic ASP. Here's a few hundred lines out of their navigation menu. class=menuMain\u003e \u003c% if menu = \"1\" then Response.Write \"Home\" else Response.Write \"Home\" end if if menu = \"2\" then Response.Write \"About us\" else Response.Write \"About us\" end if if menu = \"3\" then Response.Write \"How to book\" else Response.Write \"How to book\" end if if menu = \"4\" then Response.Write \"Expeditions\" else Response.Write \"Expeditions\" end if if menu = \"5\" then Response.Write \"Safety\" else Response.Write \"Safety\" end if if menu = \"6\" then Response.Write \"Fundraising\" else Response.Write \"Fundraising\" end if if menu = \"7\" then Response.Write \"Work for us\" else Response.Write \"Work for us\" end if if menu = \"8\" then Response.Write \"Contact us\" else Response.Write \"Contact us\" end if Response.Write \"\" Response.Write \"\" if menu = \"1\" then end if if menu = \"2\" then if submenu = \"1\" then Response.Write \"Who we are\" else Response.Write \"Who we are\" end if if submenu = \"2\" then Response.Write \"CSR\" else Response.Write \"CSR\" end if if submenu = \"3\" then Response.Write \"Partners and accreditation\" else Response.Write \"Partners and accreditation\" end if if submenu = \"4\" then Response.Write \"Curriculum links\" else Response.Write \"Curriculum links\" end if if submenu = \"5\" then Response.Write \"Expedition advice\" else Response.Write \"Expedition advice\" end if if submenu = \"6\" then Response.Write \"Press resources\" else Response.Write \"Press resources\" end if end if if menu = \"3\" then Response.Write \"\" end if if menu = \"4\" then if submenu = \"1\" then Response.Write \"Central and North America\" else Response.Write \"Central and North America\" end if if submenu = \"2\" then Response.Write \"South America\" else Response.Write \"South America\" end if if submenu = \"3\" then Response.Write \"South East Asia\" else Response.Write \"South East Asia\" end if if submenu = \"4\" then Response.Write \"Asia\" else Response.Write \"Asia\" end if if submenu = \"5\" then Response.Write \"Africa\" else Response.Write \"Africa\" end if if submenu = \"6\" then Response.Write \"Europe\" else Response.Write \"Europe\" end if if submenu = \"7\" then Response.Write \"Community projects\" else Response.Write \"Community projects\" end if if submenu = \"8\" then Response.Write \"Independent\" else Response.Write \"Independent\" end if end if if menu = \"5\" then if submenu = \"1\" then Response.Write \"Safe people\" else Response.Write \"Safe people\" end if if submenu = \"2\" then Response.Write \"Safe places\" else Response.Write \"Safe places\" end if if submenu = \"3\" then Response.Write \"Safe practices and policies\" else Response.Write \"Safe practices and policies\" end if if submenu = \"4\" then Response.Write \"Safe resources\" else Response.Write \"Safe resources\" end if if submenu = \"5\" then Response.Write \"Operations Centre\" else Response.Write \"Operations Centre\" end if if submenu = \"6\" then Response.Write \"Travelsafe course\" else Response.Write \"Travelsafe course\" end if end if if menu = \"6\" then ' if submenu = \"1\" then ' Response.Write \"Fundraising team\" ' else ' Response.Write \"Fundraising team\" ' end if if submenu = \"2\" then Response.Write \"Fundraising ideas\" else Response.Write \"Fundraising ideas\" end if if submenu = \"3\" then Response.Write \"Fundraising events\" else Response.Write \"Fundraising events\" end if end if if menu = \"7\" then if submenu = \"1\" then Response.Write \"Lead an expedition\" else Response.Write \"Lead an expedition\" end if if submenu = \"2\" then Response.Write \"Office based positions\" else Response.Write \"Office based positions\" end if end if if menu = \"8\" then if submenu = \"1\" then Response.Write \"Request a brochure\" else Response.Write \"Request a brochure\" end if if submenu = \"2\" then Response.Write \"Sign up for e-news\" else Response.Write \"Sign up for e-news\" end if if submenu = \"3\" then Response.Write \"Press resources\" else Response.Write \"Press resources\" end if end if %\u003e This renders the whole menu, but based on the selected menu and submenu, it adds an activ class to the HTML elements. Which means that each HTML element is defined here twice, once with and without the CSS class on it. I know folks like to talk about dry code, but this code is SOGGY with repetition. Just absolutely dripping wet with the same thing multiple times. Moist. [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds. Learn more.",

    "description": "I never did explain the elusive off-by-one I hinted at, did I? A little meta, perhaps. It is our practice at Error'd to supply five nuggets of joy each week. But in episode previous-plus-one, you actually got six! (Or maybe, depending on how you count them, that's yet another off-by-one. I slay me.) If that doesn't tickle you enough, just wait until you hear what Dave L. brought us. Meanwhile... \"YATZP\" scoffed self-styled Foo AKA F. Yet Another Time Zone P*, I guess. Not wrong. According to Herr Aka F., \"German TV teletext (yes, we still have it!) botched the DST start (upper right corner). The editors realized it and posted a message stating as much, sent from the 'future' (i.e. correct) time zone.\"   Michael R. wrote in with a thought-provoker. If I'm representing one o'clock as 1:00, two o'clock as 2:00, and so forth, why should zero o'clock be the only time represented with not just one, but TWO leading zeroes? Logically, zero o'clock should be represented simply by :00, right?   Meanwhile, (just) Randy points out that somebody failed to pay attention to detail. \"Did a full-scroll on Baeldung's members page and saw this. Sometimes, even teachers don't get it right.\"   In case Michael R. is still job-hunting Gary K. has found the perfect position for everyone. That is, assuming the tantalizingly missing Pay Range section conforms to the established pattern. \"Does this mean I should put my qualifications in?\" he wondered. Run, don't walk.   And in what I think is an all-time first for us, Dave L. brings (drum roll) an audio Error'd \"I thought you'd like this recording from my Garmin watch giving me turn-by-turn directions: In 280.097 feet turn right. That's two hundred eighty feet and ONE POINT ONE SIX FOUR INCHES. Accuracy to a third of a millimeter!\" Don't move your hand!
