You don't want them to sabotage your order like these folks did…Of course, two wrongs don't necessarily make a right, but it's hard not to think they do when you're dealing with an entitled Karen customer. These creatures always have the audacity to complain and mask their privilege behind a false impression that they are the aggrieved ones in this world. You can try to get these people to humble themselves or to shake them awake to the fact that the world does not revolve around them, but here's the deal: If you try that, you are less likely to succeed.The best way to deal with entitled Karen customers is to quietly but carefully make their lives difficult while letting their anger and frustrations roll off your back.

No one wants to admit that they care about material possessions when the concept comes up near the end of a family member's life, but guess what? When push comes to shove, it's always surprising to see whose claws come out.Sometimes, the people who claim to not care are the ones who become the most entitled and possessive throughout the difficult process of going through a family member's belongings. Sometimes, the people you would think would be insanely difficult end up being the decent ones with a stronger understanding of fairness than anyone anticipated. Unfortunately, it only takes one person's ego to make the process more difficult than it needs to be. Here's a multi-part saga about an entitled father who insisted that he deserved the majority of the grandfather's inheritance. When the grandfather himself caught wind of this tension, he decided to change the will without the father's knowledge.",

    "description": "Hey friends, gather 'round for a beautiful and unexpected tale from the always-mysterious cat distribution system. Last year, the original poster adopted a sweet mama cat from a local family who claimed she was on \"cat birth control pills.\" But just three days later, during a vet visit for what was supposed to be a routine spay appointment, came the surprise, she was pregnant.Less than a month after settling in, she gave birth to two kittens. While only one little orange fluff made it, his presence has filled the home with joy ever since. He's lovingly referred to as \"my orange guy\" and has fully settled into his forever home, even being accepted by his feline sister. Mama cat was spayed soon after, and her orange kitten was neutered when the time came.And here's the magical part. The first kitten, who sadly did not survive, was gently buried beneath a cherry tree in the garden. Not long after, a huge sunflower bloomed right above the spot, a quiet, beautiful reminder of love and life. What began as a simple adoption turned into a story of surprise, healing, and a tiny orange kitten who changed everything.",

    "description": "We talked about singletons a bit last week. That reminded John of a story from the long ago dark ages where we didn't have always accessible mobile Internet access. At the time, John worked for a bank. The bank, as all banks do, wanted to sell mortgages. This often meant sending an agent out to meet with customers face to face, and those agents needed to show the customer what their future would look like with that mortgage- payment calculations, and pretty little graphs about equity and interest. Today, this would be a simple website, but again, reliable Internet access wasn't a thing. So they built a client side application. They tested the heck out of it, and it worked well. Sales agents were happy. Customers were happy. The bank itself was happy. Time passed, as it has a way of doing, and the agents started clamoring for a mobile web version, that they could use on their phones. Now, the first thought was, \"Wire it up to the backend!\" but the backend they had was a mainframe, and there was a dearth of mainframe developers. And while the mainframe was the source of truth, and the one place where mortgages actually lived, building a mortgage calculator that could do pretty visualizations was far easier- and they already had one. The client app was in .NET, and it was easy enough to wrap the mortgage calculation objects up in a web service. A quick round of testing of the service proved that it worked just as well as the old client app, and everyone was happy - for awhile. Sometimes, agents would run a calculation and get absolute absurd results. Developers, putting in exactly the same values into their test environment wouldn't see the bad output. Testing the errors in production didn't help either- it usually worked just fine. There was a Heisenbug, but how could a simple math calculation that had already been tested and used for years have a Heisenbug? Well, the calculation ran by simulation- it simply iteratively applied payments and interest to generate the entire history of the loan. And as it turns out, because the client application which started this whole thing only ever needed one instance of the calculator, someone had made it a singleton. And in their web environment, this singleton wasn't scoped to a single request, it was a true global object, which meant when simultaneous requests were getting processed, they'd step on each other and throw off the iteration. And testing didn't find it right away, because none of their tests were simulating the effect of multiple simultaneous users. The fix was simple- stop being a singleton, and ensure every request got its own instance. But it's also a good example of misapplication of patterns- there was no need in the client app to enforce uniqueness via the singleton pattern. A calculator that holds state probably shouldn't be a singleton in the first place. [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.

    "description": "When faced with an information system lacking sufficient richness to permit its users to express all of the necessary data states, human beings will innovate. In other words, they will find creative ways to bend the system to their will, usually (but not always) inconsequentially. In the early days of information systems, even before electronic computers, we found users choosing to insert various out-of-bounds values into data fields to represent states such as \"I don't know the true value for this item\" or \"It is impossible accurately state the true value of this item because of faulty constraint being applied to the input mechanism\" or other such notions. This practice carried on into the computing age, so that now, numeric fields will often contain values of 9999 or 99999999. Taxpayer numbers will be listed as 000-00-0000 or any other repetition of the same digit or simple sequences. Requirements to enter names collected John Does. Now we also see a fair share of Disney characters. Programmers then try to make their systems idiot-proof, with the obvious and entirely predictable results.The mere fact that these inventions exist at all is entirely due to the ommission of mechanisms for the metacommentary that we all know perfectly well is sometimes necessary. But rather than provide those, it's easier to wave our hands and pretend that these unwanted states won't exist, can be ignored, can be glossed over. \"Relax\" they'll tell you. \"It probably won't ever happen.\" \"If it does happen, it won't matter.\" \"Don't lose your head over it.\" The Beast in Black certainly isn't inclined to cover up an errant sentinel. \"For that price, it had better be a genuine Louis XVI pillow from 21-January-1793.\" A La Lanterne!   Daniel D. doubled up on Error'ds for us. \"Do you need the error details? Yes, please.\"   And again with an alert notification oopsie. \"Google Analytics 4 never stops surprising us any given day with how bugged it is. I call it an \"Exclamation point undefined\". You want more info? Just Google it... Oh wait.\" I do appreciate knowing who is responsible for the various bodges we are sent. Thank you, Daniel.   \"Dark pattern or dumb pattern?\" wonders an anonymous reader. I don't think it's very dark.   Finally, Ian Campbell found a data error that doesn't look like an intentional sentinel. But I'm not sure what this number represents. It is not an integral power of 2. Says Ian, \"SendGrid has a pretty good free plan now with a daily limit of nine quadrillion seven trillion one hundred ninety-nine billion two hundred fifty-four million seven hundred forty thousand nine hundred ninety-two.\"   [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
