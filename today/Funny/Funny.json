    "description": "There's something about Fridays that makes everyone collectively decide that work can wait. Maybe it's the promise of a 48-hour break (which feels way too short when you put it that way), or maybe it's just the primal urge to mentally clock out early. By 3 p.m. on Friday, Slack is silent, email chains mysteriously stop, and half the team is \"wrapping up\" for the weekend. Translation: watching dog videos and scrolling through memes until it's socially acceptable to leave.The problem is that Monday doesn't care about your Friday vibes. All those tasks you ignored in favor of weekend daydreams are still there, sitting on your desk, staring you down first thing Monday morning. But do we ever learn? Of course not. By Thursday afternoon, we're already in the same cycle, casually pretending that \"future us\" will handle it. Spoiler alert: future us is tired. But what's life without a little chaos? Here's to the Friday checkouts and the Monday regrets—we wouldn't have it any other way.",

    "description": "These hotel receptionists were giving guests the side-eye. Not everyone can act normal out in public, and these people are proof of that! Front desk workers do much more than just check-in guests. Many of them work long hours and supervise other workers and guests as well. If a guest needs a towel or a toothbrush, they're the one to provide it. Some guests will show up without a reservation and make it the receptionist's problem to solve. They're flipping out because they have a reservation in someone else's name or they just plain forgot, and the front desk worker will have to try and solve the problem for them. Other guests go through the check-in process just fine, but once they're comfy in their room, they start acting out. You can't just smoke out a hotel room just because you feel like it, or damage the room and expect workers to turn a blind eye to it. Read about the day-to-day life of a hotel receptionist down below and discover all the crazy shenanigans these guests have gotten into. After that, if you're having a bad day, you'll feel much better after reading about some folks who are having a worse one, like one person who discovered that someone snapped a side mirror off their car and just left it there.",

Yes, even as we're writing this listicle, we're counting down the minutes until we have to set our alarm clocks for Meownday morning. We're so full of dread that we can barely continue, but the show must go on and we need to get paid (how else are we going to buy our cat's organic, free-range tuna that they love so much?). Luckily, there is a solution to every problem, and the solution to this pawsitively painful experience of the weekend ending is none other than cat memes.You prrrobably could have guessed it without reading the first paragraph because if you've ever read any of our listicles before, we say all the time that feline funnies are the cure for any ailment. A broken heart (heartwarming/heart-mending cat memes), a bad day (silly feline funnies), and even a busted television (pay the repairman/woman in cat memes). Luckily we don't have to deal with any of those problems today, just not wanting to go to work tomorrow. So let's count our blessings and enjoy these silly billy felines for the rest of our weekend. Enjoy!",

We like to make everything sunshine, rainbows, and pawsitivity over here at I Can Has Cheezburger, but we're a hooman too, and we also have bad days. We had a series of pretty bad days a few years ago, to the point where things were getting a little dark. But then, a cute, smol kitten wandered into our lives with the help of the cat distribution system, and everything started to get better. They became our reason for getting out of bed in the meowrning, even if their incessant meowing at 5 AM was annoying at times. They gave us a reason to be excited to come home, to go to bed, and even to have someone to share a meal with. They are our prrecious fur baby, our furrever snuggle buddy, and our lives would be seriously sour without them in it. Scroll down to see some other cat lovers' reasons for getting out of bed in the meowrning (they may not be as cute as your cat, but they are certainly awwdorable!).",

Even the core parts of the platform are a nightmare We're going to take this one in chunks, because it's big and ugly. try { if (isset($_POST)) { $name = $_POST['objName']; $lst_name = $_POST['objLstName']; $email = $_POST['objEmail']; $phone = $_POST['objGsm']; $message = $_POST['objMsg']; $verifycode = $_POST['objVerifyCode']; /******************************************************/ $objCmpT = $_POST['objCmpT']; $objCmpS = $_POST['objCmpS']; $objCountry = $_POST['objCountry']; $objCity = $_POST['objCity']; $objName2 = $_POST['objName2']; $objLstName2 = $_POST['objLstName2']; $objQuality = $_POST['objQuality']; $objEmail = $_POST['objEmail']; $objMsg2 = $_POST['objMsg2']; $objVerifyCode2 = $_POST['objVerifyCode2']; I don't love that there's no structure or class here, to organize these fields, but this isn't bad, per se. We have a bunch of form fields, and we jam them into a bunch of variables. I am going to, with no small degree of willpower, not comment on the hungarian notation present in the field names. Look at me not commenting on it. I'm definitely not commenting on it. Look at me not commenting that some, but not all, of the variables also get the same hungarian prefix. What's the point of hungarian notation when everything just gets the same thing anyway; like hungarian is always bad, but this is just USELESS Ahem. Let's continue with the code. $ok = 0; $ok2 = 0; $sendTo = \"example@example.com\"; $golableMSG = ' -First Name \u0026 Last Name :' . $name . ' ' . $lst_name . ' -email :' . $email . ' -Phone Number : 0' . $phone . ' -Message : ' . $message; $globaleMSG2 = ' -First Name \u0026 Last Name :' . $objName2 . ' ' . $objLstName2 . ' -Email :' . $objEmail . ' -Type of company : ' . $objCmpT . ' -Sector of activity : ' . $objCmpS . ' -Country : ' . $objCountry . ' -City : ' . $objCity . ' -Your position within the company : ' . $objQuality . ' -Message : ' . $objMsg2; We munge all those form fields into strings. These are clearly going to be the bodies of our messages. Only now I'm noticing that the user had to supply two different names- $name and $objName2. Extra points here, as I believe they meant to name both of these message variables globaleMSG but misspelled the first one, golableMSG. Well, let's continue. if (!$name) { $data['msg1'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg1'] = ''; } if (!$lst_name) { $data['msg2'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg2'] = ''; } if (!$email) { $data['msg3'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg3'] = ''; } if ($phone \u003c= 0) { $data['msg4'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg4'] = ''; } if (!$message) { $data['msg5'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg5'] = ''; } if (!$verifycode) { $data['msg6'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg6'] = ''; } /*********************************************************************************/ if (!$objCmpS) { $data['msg7'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg7'] = ''; } if (!$objCountry) { $data['msg8'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg8'] = ''; } if (!$objCity) { $data['msg9'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg9'] = ''; } if (!$objName2) { $data['msg10'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg10'] = ''; } if (!$objLstName2) { $data['msg11'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg11'] = ''; } if (!$objQuality) { $data['msg12'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg12'] = ''; } if (!$objMsg2) { $data['msg13'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg13'] = ''; } if (!$objVerifyCode2) { $data['msg14'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg14'] = ''; } What… what are we doing here? I worry that what I'm looking at here is some sort of preamble to verification code. But why is it like this? Why? /********************************************************************************/ if ($ok == 6) { if (preg_match(\"/^[ a-z,.+!:;()-]+$/\", $name)) { $data['msg1_1'] = ''; if (preg_match(\"/^[ a-z,.+!:;()-]+$/\", $lst_name)) { $data['msg2_2'] = ''; $subject = $name . \" \" . $lst_name; if (filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) { $data['msg3_3'] = ''; $from = $email; if (preg_match(\"/^[6-9][0-9]{8}$/\", $phone)) { $data['msg4_4'] = ''; if (intval($verifycode) == intval($_COOKIE['nmbr1']) + intval($_COOKIE['nmbr2'])) { $data['msg6_6'] = ''; $headers = 'From: ' . $from . \"\\r\\n\" . 'Reply-To: ' . $sendTo . \"\\r\\n\" . 'X-Mailer: PHP/' . phpversion(); mail($sendTo, $subject, $golableMSG, $headers); $data['msgfinal'] = 'Votre Messsage est bien envoyer'; /*$data = array('success' =\u003e 'Votre Messsage est bien envoyer', 'postData' =\u003e $_POST);*/ } else { $data['msg6_6'] = 'votre resultat est incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg4_4'] = 'Votre Numéro est incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg3_3'] = 'Votre Email est incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg2_2'] = 'Votre Prénom est Incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg1_1'] = 'Votre Nom est Incorrect'; } } Oh look, it is validation code. Their verification code system, presumably to prevent spamming messages, is not particularly secure or useful. The real thing I see here, though, is the namespaced keys. Earlier, we set $data['msg1'], and now we're setting $data['msg1_1'] which is a code stench that could kill from a hundred yards. And don't worry, we do the same thing for the other message we send: /**************************************************************/ if ($ok2 == 8) { if (preg_match(\"/^[ a-z,.+!:;()-]+$/\", $objName2)) { $data['msg10_10'] = ''; if (preg_match(\"/^[ a-z,.+!:;()-]+$/\", $objLstName2)) { $data['msg11_11'] = ''; $subject2 = $objName2 . \" \" . $objLstName2; if (intval($objVerifyCode2) == intval($_COOKIE['nmbr3']) + intval($_COOKIE['nmbr4'])) { $from2 = $objEmail; $data['msg14_14'] = ''; $headers2 = 'From: ' . $from2 . \"\\r\\n\" . 'Reply-To: ' . $sendTo . \"\\r\\n\" . 'X-Mailer: PHP/' . phpversion(); mail($sendTo, $subject2, $globaleMSG2, $headers2); $data['msgfinal'] = 'Votre Messsage est bien envoyer'; } else { $data['msg14_14'] = 'votre resultat est incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg11_11'] = 'Votre Prénom est Incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg10_10'] = 'Votre Nom est Incorrect'; } } Phew. Hey, remember way back at the top, when we checked to see if the $_POST variable were set? Well, we do have an else clause for that. } else { throw new \\Exception($mot[86]); } Who doesn't love throwing messages by hard-coded array indexes in your array of possible error messages? Couldn't be bothered with a constant, could we? Nope, message 86 it is. But don't worry about that exception going uncaught. Remember, this whole thing was inside of a try: } catch (\\Exception $e) { $data['msgfinal'] = \"Votre Messsage n'est pas bien envoyer\"; /*$data = array('danger' =\u003e 'Votre Messsage pas bien envoyer', 'postData' =\u003e $_POST);*/ } Yeah, it didn't matter what message we picked, because we just catch the exception and hard-code out an error message. Also, I don't speak French, but is \"message\" supposed to have an extra \"s\" in it? Charles writes: It’s crazy to see such sloppy work on a platform that seems okay at first glance. Honestly, this platform is the holy grail of messy code—it could have its own course on how not to code because of how bad and error-prone it is. There are also even worse scenarios of bad code, but it's too long to share, and honestly, they're too deep and fundamentally ingrained in the system to even begin explaining. Oh, I'm sure we could explain it. The explanation may be \"there was a severe and fatal lack of oxygen in the office, and this is what hypoxia looks like in code,\" but I'm certain there'd be an explanation. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
