I'll be honest: In this situation I've been known to do my best \"Mrs. Kravitz\" impression, craning my head through the gap in the curtains and straining to see who is parking outside my house at 2 AM.The poster here seems to go back and forth as to what the issue is, he starts off mentioning that his wife was texted by the neighbor about the trailer, yet he seems to be focused on the truck being the issue. It would make much more sense if it was the trailer or the combined pairing of the two that was the issue. Whatever the issue, sounds like Jill needs to chill.",

Instead of their personal items decorating their desk, there's just a blank desk and a laptop sitting there. Then, someone will usually clue you in that your coworker has gotten the boot. It's often surprising, and you find out later that the person you thought you knew so well was actually up to some shady business! Next up, read about some absolutely hilarious answers that some job candidates gave their job interviewers, like one person who said, \"Is this going to take long?

We do it all the time. We see a stray cat, and we simply have to try. They may not want us to pet them, they may walk away, but we have to. Would we even be true to ourselves if we didn't. And while it is true that most stray cats are not interested in us or our pettings whatsoever, some of them like us. And that makes it worth it. Befriending a stray cat is a great honor. It is an achievement like no other. These cats don't need you, they don't have to give you their time of day, but they do. Because they like you. And that means that you are pawsome. And to see that little cat get so excited when you walk by them, to see them running up to you with their cute little meows… it makes our day every single time.",

We love being greeted by our fluffy felines the second we walk in the door, having them loaf on our chests or in between our legs while we're curled up on the couch, and most of all - we love kissing their tiny, purrfect little heads. However. We do not love when they break a lamp at 3 AM in the middle of their midnight zoomies, or when they decide to wage an epic battle against our toilet paper while we're at work.These are some of the many meowments we pawrents face in our daily lives with our cute cats. But, we did know what we were signing up for, so all we can do is just laugh about it. Below you will find some snapshots of cats just being cats - their pawsitively ameowzing, purrfectly cute, and curiously chaotic selves. It may be annoying, but we wouldn't change a single thing about them.",

    "description": "Mark was debugging some database querying code, and got a bit confused about what it was actually doing. Specifically, it generated a query block like this: $statement=\"declare @status int declare @msg varchar(30) exec @status=sp_doSomething 'arg1', ... select @msg=convert(varchar(10),@status) print @msg \"; $result = sybase_query ($statement, $this-\u003econnection); Run a stored procedure, capture its return value in a variable, stringify that variable and print it. The select/print must be for debugging, right? Leftover debugging code. Why else would you do something like that? if (sybase_get_last_message()!=='0') { ... } Oh no. sybase_get_last_message gets the last string printed out by a print statement. This is a pretty bonkers way to get the results of a function or procedure call back, especially when if there are any results (like a return value), they'll be in the $result return value. Now that said, reading through those functions, it's a little unclear if you can actually get the return value of a stored procedure this way. Without testing it myself (and no, I'm not doing that), we're in a world where this might actually be the best way to do this. So I'm not 100% sure where the WTF lies. In the developer? In the API designers? Sybase being TRWTF is always a pretty reliable bet. I suppose there's a reason why all those functions are listed as \"REMOVED IN PHP 7.0.0\", which was was rolled out through 2015. So at least those functions have been dead for a decade.

    "description": "We talked about singletons a bit last week. That reminded John of a story from the long ago dark ages where we didn't have always accessible mobile Internet access. At the time, John worked for a bank. The bank, as all banks do, wanted to sell mortgages. This often meant sending an agent out to meet with customers face to face, and those agents needed to show the customer what their future would look like with that mortgage- payment calculations, and pretty little graphs about equity and interest. Today, this would be a simple website, but again, reliable Internet access wasn't a thing. So they built a client side application. They tested the heck out of it, and it worked well. Sales agents were happy. Customers were happy. The bank itself was happy. Time passed, as it has a way of doing, and the agents started clamoring for a mobile web version, that they could use on their phones. Now, the first thought was, \"Wire it up to the backend!\" but the backend they had was a mainframe, and there was a dearth of mainframe developers. And while the mainframe was the source of truth, and the one place where mortgages actually lived, building a mortgage calculator that could do pretty visualizations was far easier- and they already had one. The client app was in .NET, and it was easy enough to wrap the mortgage calculation objects up in a web service. A quick round of testing of the service proved that it worked just as well as the old client app, and everyone was happy - for awhile. Sometimes, agents would run a calculation and get absolute absurd results. Developers, putting in exactly the same values into their test environment wouldn't see the bad output. Testing the errors in production didn't help either- it usually worked just fine. There was a Heisenbug, but how could a simple math calculation that had already been tested and used for years have a Heisenbug? Well, the calculation ran by simulation- it simply iteratively applied payments and interest to generate the entire history of the loan. And as it turns out, because the client application which started this whole thing only ever needed one instance of the calculator, someone had made it a singleton. And in their web environment, this singleton wasn't scoped to a single request, it was a true global object, which meant when simultaneous requests were getting processed, they'd step on each other and throw off the iteration. And testing didn't find it right away, because none of their tests were simulating the effect of multiple simultaneous users. The fix was simple- stop being a singleton, and ensure every request got its own instance. But it's also a good example of misapplication of patterns- there was no need in the client app to enforce uniqueness via the singleton pattern. A calculator that holds state probably shouldn't be a singleton in the first place. [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.
