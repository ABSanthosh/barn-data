In today's story, we encounter a woman trying to convince her sister to change her dog's name so her child can claim that name. This woman has had her dog for several years and named the dog Aurora, a reminder of her late mother, who'd read Sleeping Beauty as a bedtime story while the kids were growing up. Her sister becomes pregnant with her first baby and wants to name the child Aurora as well. I'd understand the concern if this dog was a human child, but this mother to be really guilt trips her sister about this name. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't mind sharing a name with my dog cousin. I'll let you be the judge. Are you team baby or team dog?",

    "description": "One wrong letter or word can make a whole phrase mean something entirely different! You might accidentally be implying the opposite of what you intended, or you might just have made yourself look like a total ignoramus. Regardless, nine times out of ten, a decently intelligent person will catch themselves and rebound nicely, whereas an unintelligent person might not even notice their colossal mistake. The worst is when they're called out on said error and they double down, insisting that they're right. That means they're daft and stubborn, a lethal combination.I'll never forget that time in high school when someone fully wrote a paper about Leonardo Da Vinci, only he referred to the renowned painter as the Oscar-winning actor instead. You will see that someone else made the same mistake below. This also reminds me of a close friend of mine who spelled Mick Jagger like McDonald's (McJagger) throughout a college paper. We can laugh about it now, but it was a total face-palm moment back in school.",

Recently, it was Father's Day, and we sent a sarcastic, yet silly, note in our family group chat accusing everyone of not wishing us a happy Father's Day. Our parents responded with, \"But you're not a father!\", to which we said, \"How dare you! Mr. Whiskers is our child!\" We weren't really upset that nobody wished us a happy Father's Day (even Mr. Whiskers), but the sentiment remains true: he is our literal cat child.And he's way more purrfect than any of your hooman children, anyway. He's clean, only cries when he's hungry or we haven't paid enough attention to him, and we haven't once had to change his diaper (he doesn't even have a diaper). So, if you're like us and you treat your cats like your fur babies, welcome. This is a safe space for you. And better yet, we've got a bunch of cat memes that just make sense for us pawrents.

    "description": "Anybody out there who thinks that being a momma cat is easy because cats are \"independent\" is wrong. Being a cat momma is hard work. Because before your kittens get all independent… well, they need to be taught how to be independent. Kittens need to learn how to drink water from a bowl without getting it all up in their noses. Kittens need to learn how to communicate properly - so that they know exactly how to demand everything that they need from their human servants. Being a cat mom to one kitten is enough work. Hard work. But most momma cats don't give birth to just one kitten. It's usually around four kittens per litter, maybe six, depending on the breed of the cat. Eight is the most that we have heard of before. And yet, this momma cat has broken the record. The human who had rescued her thought that, after hours and hours of delivery, seven was going to be the end of it, but the next morning… they got a couple more surprises. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.

Without debating the merits of loads of getters and setters versus bare properties, ideally, getters and setters are the easiest code to write. Many IDEs will just generate them for you! How can you screw up getters and setters? Well, Dave found someone who could. private ReportDatesDao reportDatesDao; @Resource(name = CensusDao.BEAN_NAME) public void setAuditDao(CensusDao censusDao) { this.reportDatesDao = reportDatesDao; } The function is called setAuditDao, takes a CensusDao input, but manipulates reportDatesDao, because clearly someone copy/pasted and didn't think about what they were doing. The result, however, is that this just sets this.reportDatesDao equal to itself. I'm always impressed by code which given the chance to make multiple decisions makes every wrong choice, even if it is just lazy copy/paste.
