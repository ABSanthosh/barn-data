    "description": "When one works a job that requires a daily quota, the best way to manage that is by never going under that quota, but never going over it either.Not going under the daily quota is self-explanatory. If you are hired to do a certain amount of work, doing anything less than that might suggest you are not the right person for the job. However, going over the daily quota is something that some employees see as a positive. By doing more than you're actually required to do, you are proving that you are a hardworking and trustworthy employee willing to go above and beyond for the sake of the company. What is wrong with that?Well, the moment you prove to your employer that you can do more than is required, they might start getting used to this new output of work. Which means that if you ever find yourself doing anything less, management is not going to be happy about it.You shouldn't do anything more than what is expected of you, but if you are still unsure, maybe the story below will tip you over.",

    "description": "Imagine leaving a company on great terms and being encouraged to come back should the situation arise… until it does and they reject you.If this has happened to you, surely you had a similar reaction to this author. The initial impression might be that there must have been some kind of mistake. After all, your former manager always told you that there would be a position waiting for you at the company upon your return. Maybe the hiring manager just wasn't informed, and there was an innocent mixup, right? That explanation would still be slightly embarrassing, but everyone makes mistakes. Well, for this author, it turns out that the promise of always being able to return to their former company was a bit of an over-exaggeration. Keep scrolling below to find out what happened when the author confronted their former employer, and the clueless comment their employer made next!",

And we have seen it happen! We have, for real. We have seen people cuddle with lions, we have seen people sleeping next to cheetahs, we have seen brave Russian women smooch huge Siberian lynxes! And yes, while it's true that most of these people are the caretakers of these animals and have grown up with them, that doesn't mean that we can't! Look at that woman. She's just a brave Russian. We can be brave too.But alas, for now, this will simply have to remain a dream for us. And we will have to live vicariously through other people - watch them cuddle with our favorite animals. We thought that we have seen all of these stories, but it seems like we haven't, because this one was completely new to us. A man rescuing a lioness cub who was abandoned by her mother an, hand-raising her himself, and forming the kind of bond with her that we are not sure we have ever seen before.",

    "description": "One of the most wonderful things about cats is they love to be pawrents. Cats will adopt just about anything that needs a meowther and/or father figure, including otters, bunnies, and even puppies! We, as hoomans, could learn a thing or two from their generosity. We could also learn a thing or two about their gracefulness, but that's a whole different listicle. Anyway, there's no better example than this story below featuring a kitten, an even smaller kitten, and a pawrent who got bamboozled into 2x the cuteness.We, more so than most people, understand the commitment of owning cats. The more cats you have, the more commitment it is (until you reach about four, then it's all kind of the same), so we understand it when people say they only want one cat. But after rescuing a tiny void baby and bringing it home, their cat decided to adopt it despite the pawrent's wishes to rehome it. And we all know that what the cat wants, the cat gets.

    "description": "\"Boy, stringly typed data is hard to work with. I wish there were some easier way to work with it!\" This, presumably, is what Gary's predecessor said. Followed by, \"Wait, I have an idea!\" public static Object createValue(String string) { Object value = parseBoolean(string); if (value != null) { return value; } value = parseInteger(string); if (value != null) { return value; } value = parseDouble(string); if (value != null) { return value; } return string; } This takes a string, and then tries to parse it, first into a boolean, failing that into an integer, and failing that into a double. Otherwise, it returns the original string. And it returns an object, which means you still get to guess what's in there even after this. You just get to guess what it returned, and hope you cast it to the correct type. Which means this almost certainly is called like this: boolean myBoolField = (Boolean)createValue(someStringContainingABool); Which makes the whole thing useless, which is fun. Gary found this code in a \"long since abandoned\" project, and I can't imagine why it ended up getting abandoned.
