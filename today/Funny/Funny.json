    "description": "Some employers love to preach loyalty, but as soon as they think that they might be better off without you—or that you haven't made them as much money as you could have—they won't hesitate to send you packing, no matter how long you've worked together and what your contributions have been previously. This isn't true of all employers and all situations, but the bad experiences, stories, and accounts are enough to make anyone wary.What's certain here is that you should never give notice to an employer whilst traveling, that's just begging for disaster and to be stranded wherever you are with the burden and expense of getting yourself home placed squarely on your shoulders. Sure, depending on the circumstances involved, you might be able to pursue legal action, but it's better not to be placed in a compromising and possibly unsafe situation in the first place. This is tricky, of course, if you're always traveling for work, leaving little opportunity to safely give notice.This supervisor aimed to leave his current employer on good terms due to unexplained circumstances. Not wanting to burn any bridges and looking to leave the door open to working together in the future, he gave his two-week notice while away on assignment. He was surprised to find that his employer's response was to immediately cancel his return flight home, stranding him where he was stationed for work.Frustrated, he turned to this online community to share his experience, garnering ample advice and reactions from readers.",

    "description": "Job applications get old real fast. The worst are the ones that require you to upload your resume, then, when you click to the next page, they ask you to reenter everything. You need to type in when and where you went to school, the dates of all your jobs, your job titles and job descriptions, and more. You have to retype every little thing, and there's no way around it if you want to apply to jobs!Another more recent thing that's been getting on people's nerves is having to do recorded video interviews. Instead of talking to a person face to face, people are now asked to talk into a camera, alone in a room. They have to answer questions, often in 1-3 minutes, and sometimes, the company won't even allow you to rerecord your answer! Other people have the opposite problem, and they keep rerecording their answers until they feel it's perfect enough to submit, which can take hours. Check out a bunch of these unfortunate job applications below! Next, read about the gift givers who are just awful at giving presents, like one person who gave someone a regifted half-empty bottle of perfume and called it \"vintage.\"",

    "description": "If you have grown up in the western world, there is one thing that you will be absolutely one hundred percent unable to deny. And that is that in some part of your heart, if not all of it, you love Santa. He represents so much good, in a world filled with so much bad, that this figure is engrained in many of our memories as a sign that if even only for a moment, everything will be ok.A great example of this being that every Home Alone movie ended at Christmas when the family came home and Kevin McCallister was found to be right as rain by his family. Even if they were going to do the same thing the following year. So we figured that we might pump up the feels by incorporating cute cats into this list of heartwarming cat memes to nourish your Santa-loving soul.",

    "description": "Michael had a co-worker who was new to the team. As such, there was definitely an expected ramp-up time. But this new developer got that ramp up time, and still wasn't performing. Worse, they ended up dragging down the entire team, as they'd go off, write a bunch of code, end up in a situation that they couldn't understand why nothing was working, and then beg for help. For example, this dev was tasked with adding timestamps to a set of logging messages. The logs had started as simple \"print\" debugging messages, but had grown in complexity and it was time to treat them like real logging. This stumped them, as the following C# code only ever printed out a zero: DateTime d = new DateTime(); int timestamp = d.Minute + d.Second + d.Millisecond; Console.WriteLine(timestamp + message); On one hand, this is a clear example of not understanding operator overloading- clearly, they understood that + could be used for string concatenation, but they seem to have forgotten that it could also be used for arithmetic. I don't think this actually only ever printed out a zero. It certainly didn't print out a timestamp, but it also didn't print out a zero. So not only is the code bad, but the understanding of how it's bad is also bad. It's bad. Bad. Bad. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time.
