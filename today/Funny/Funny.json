You aren't getting paid to do a laundry list of items on top of your daily duties. Your day-to-day tasks are what's included in your contract, and any other duties must be given to you in writing with a pretty little dollar sign next to it.What's worse than not receiving compensation for the extra work you're doing? Being treated like garbage after you've done the work. The employee in this next story is told to stay outside and eat under the hot sun after they spent the entire day doing landscaping work that, of course, is not listed in his job description. The employee should have requested some additional pay, but that's not the issue in this story. The entitled boss let the employees doing landscaping indoors eat inside, but because of a little dirt on the employee's shoes, they had to eat outside. So, the employee left. Scroll to read.",

What is it about money that gets people so sensitive, or even offended, that it became impossible to talk about?When it comes to people's private lives, we get it. People don't want to disclose how much they make, or what their financial status is, and that's fair. But when it comes to the workplace, or at the very least, during a hiring process, we don't understand why it has become almost a rule to avoid talking about money.A job posting's most important detail is the pay; it is as simple as that. There is no reason why hiring managers should waste time, both their own and job candidates, by going through a hiring process without first discussing the wage expectations. If it's not a good fit, it is simply pointless, and all the politics around the \"negotiation\" are just a waste of time.That is why the hiring manager in the story below needs a serious wake-up call.

    "description": "What would your cat tweet about if they could? If cats could do that, generally, we're sure there would be a scene of live-tweeting about the hours of the cat waiting for their hooman to wake up. There would also be a popular meme that says \"Hooman not hoomaning\" where the cats would upload a picture with their half-empty food bowl (oh, no!) with their hooman doing nothing in the background - and definitely not filling the half-empty bowl. We're also really sure there would be so many funny cat tweets about zoomies competitions.But until evolution gives cats thumbs, all we have are tweets that cat pawrents wrote about their cats. These are absolutely ameowzing, and we endorse cat-tweeting so much. It's like the little happiness corners inside all of X. And guess what? We went through all the trouble of gathering these, so all cat pawrents here could relate. As cat pawrents ourselves, we feel validated by them. Also, they function as some of the funniest cat memes out there.",

Cats sleep for about 14 hours a day, sure, but during the time that is left… they eat plastic. Or attack your curtains. Or scream for no apparent reason. Or run into walls and then look confused about the wall being as hard as it was. Cats are beautiful and ameowzing. They have cattitude. And that catittude can only be captured with hissterical cat memes. And that is exactly what we have for you all today - a whole bunch of pawsome cat memes to enjoy. You kitty is napping at the moment. Take the chance, enjoy these silly cat memes, remind yourself that not only is the madness worth it but that others go through the same things every single day as well. You are not alone friend. The catittude and meowgic affects us all, and while it is a lot sometimes… at least the memes are worth it.",

    "description": "I never did explain the elusive off-by-one I hinted at, did I? A little meta, perhaps. It is our practice at Error'd to supply five nuggets of joy each week. But in episode previous-plus-one, you actually got six! (Or maybe, depending on how you count them, that's yet another off-by-one. I slay me.) If that doesn't tickle you enough, just wait until you hear what Dave L. brought us. Meanwhile... \"YATZP\" scoffed self-styled Foo AKA F. Yet Another Time Zone P*, I guess. Not wrong. According to Herr Aka F., \"German TV teletext (yes, we still have it!) botched the DST start (upper right corner). The editors realized it and posted a message stating as much, sent from the 'future' (i.e. correct) time zone.\"   Michael R. wrote in with a thought-provoker. If I'm representing one o'clock as 1:00, two o'clock as 2:00, and so forth, why should zero o'clock be the only time represented with not just one, but TWO leading zeroes? Logically, zero o'clock should be represented simply by :00, right?   Meanwhile, (just) Randy points out that somebody failed to pay attention to detail. \"Did a full-scroll on Baeldung's members page and saw this. Sometimes, even teachers don't get it right.\"   In case Michael R. is still job-hunting Gary K. has found the perfect position for everyone. That is, assuming the tantalizingly missing Pay Range section conforms to the established pattern. \"Does this mean I should put my qualifications in?\" he wondered. Run, don't walk.   And in what I think is an all-time first for us, Dave L. brings (drum roll) an audio Error'd \"I thought you'd like this recording from my Garmin watch giving me turn-by-turn directions: In 280.097 feet turn right. That's two hundred eighty feet and ONE POINT ONE SIX FOUR INCHES. Accuracy to a third of a millimeter!\" Don't move your hand!

    "description": "Sean sends us a one-line function that is a delight, if by delight you mean \"horror\". You'll be shocked to know it's PHP. function proget(){foreach($_GET as $k=\u003e$v){if($k==\"h\"){$GLOBALS[\"h\"]=1;}$p=explode(\",\",$k);}return($p);} //function to process GET headers Based on the comment, proget is a shorthand for process_get_parameters. Which is sort of what it does. Sort of. Let's go through this. We iterate across our $_GET parameters using $k for the key, $v for the value, but we never reference the value so forget it exists. We're iterating across every key. The first thing we check is if a key \"h\" exists. We don't look at its value, we just check if it exists, and if it does, we set a global variable. And this, right here, is enough for this to be a WTF. The logic of \"set a global variable based on the existence of a query parameter regardless of the value of the query parameter\" is… a lot. But then, somehow, this actually gets more out there. We explode the key on commas (explode being PHP's much cooler name for split), which implies… our keys may be lists of values? Which I feel like is an example of someone not understanding what a \"key\" is. But worse than that, we just do this for every key, and return the results of performing that operation on the last key. Which means that if this function is doing anything at all, it's entirely dependent on the order of the keys. Which, PHP does order the keys by the order they're added, which I take to mean that if the URL has query params like ?foo=1\u0026h=0\u0026a,b,c,d=wtf. Or, if we're being picky about encoding, ?foo=1\u0026h=0\u0026a%2Cb%2Cc%2Cd=wtf. The only good news here is that PHP handles the encoding/decoding for you, so the explode will work as expected. This is the kind of bad code that leaves me with lots of questions, and I'm not sure I want any of the answers. How did this happen, and why are questions best left unanswered, because I think the answers might cause more harm.
