    "description": "Trying to keep up with technology is turning out to be a little more difficult than we anticipated. We're young! We thought that this would be easy! And then AI happened, and it's continuing to happen, and we find ourselves having a little bit of a hard time keeping up. Or maybe we don't want to keep up. Maybe cat memes generated by AI are not the same as the hissterical cat memes that we are used to. Maybe the silly cat pictures that people keep generating using AI do not inspire us to laugh the same way that the old ones did. Maybe we don't always want to keep up, at least not with certain things. Not with cats. Cats and cat content are sacred and should not be messed with. And so, because we really feel like we all need this right now, we have put together some of the most classic and iconic cats of all time. To make you feel that meowgic again. And to give you a break from all the robot-generated content out there.",

    "description": "People have a tendency to take things way too seriously and one of those things is kid's sporting competitions.There's this thing called a \"cheat night\" that has been popularized by actors, influencers, athletes, and anyone else training seriously for an athletic event. The premise of a \"cheat night\" is that you break your regimented nutrition intake and instead of carefully monitoring everything you consume, you eat pretty much everything you want for a single evening. The idea here is that you're releasing the stress of the training while limiting bad food choices to that single night. Now, this is for serious athletes training for the events that will make or break their careers, and though it's not as if you shouldn't be taking anything you do seriously when you're 13 years old you're not necessarily competing at the pinnacle of competition where you're facing off against the best-of-the-best and every little thing counts. (Story continues below)It's not like one \"cheat night\" at 13 years old,  is going to one day, is going to cause a cascade of events a la \"The Butterfly Effect\" that is going to cause you to lose the Super Bowl, or whatever event is the pinnacle of your sport. Do you think Travis Kelce was like, \"Darn, shouldn't have eaten that bag of Fritos when I was 15 years old!\" after losing this year's Super Bowl?Regardless of whether or not the complaints are related to athletic ability. Some parents just need to calm down a bit. It's not as if any serious dietary needs or allergies weren't considered here and a little pizza and a \"cheat night\" goes a long way to helping the mental health of an athlete—at any level of competition.",

    "description": "April Fool's Day jokes are an enduring annual tradition. Whether it's your dad playing a clever dad joke or your boss delivering a \"box of donuts\" to the office, you just might get pranked on April 1 each year! Pranks for this hallowed day can be as effortless as telling a loved one that you're pregnant when you're definitely not, which is a classic. If you've got kids, you can find plenty of ways to prank them, just like one parent who froze their kids' cereal. When the kids go to take a bite, they try to lift their spoon, only to realize they've been duped. It's the little things like this that make parenting so rewarding. Check out a bunch of cute, funny, and irritating April Fool's pranks below. Next, read about the reason that this person's roommates created a whole separate group chat to complain about their \"cheap\" dinner habits: \"We were basically told that we're not good hosts.\"",

    "description": "Today's anonymous submitter worked for a \"large, US-based, e-commerce company.\" This particular company was, some time back, looking to save money, and like so many companies do, that meant hiring offshore contractors. Now, I want to stress, there's certainly nothing magical about national borders which turns software engineers into incompetents. The reality is simply that contractors never have their client's best interests at heart; they only want to be good enough to complete their contract. This gets multiplied by the contracting firm's desire to maximize their profits by keeping their contractors as booked as possible. And it gets further multiplied by the remoteness and siloing of the interaction, especially across timezones. Often, the customer sends out requirements, and three months later gets a finished feature, with no more contact than that- and it never goes well. All that said, let's look at some SQL Server code. It's long, so we'll take it in chunks. -- =============================================================================== -- Author : Ignacius Ignoramus -- Create date: 04-12-2020 -- Description: SP of Getting Discrepancy of Allocation Reconciliation Snapshot -- =============================================================================== That the comment reinforces that this is an \"SP\", aka stored procedure, is already not my favorite thing to see. The description is certainly made up of words, and I think I get the gist. ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[Discrepency] ( @startDate DATETIME, @endDate DATETIME ) AS BEGIN Nothing really to see here; it's easy to see that we're going to run a query for a date range. That's fine and common. DECLARE @tblReturn TABLE ( intOrderItemId INT ) Hmm. T-SQL lets you define table variables, which are exactly what they sound like. It's a local variable in this procedure, that acts like a table. You can insert/update/delete/query it. The vague name is a little sketch, and the fact that it holds only one field also makes me go \"hmmm\", but this isn't bad. DECLARE @tblReturn1 TABLE ( intOrderItemId INT ) Uh oh. DECLARE @tblReturn2 TABLE ( intOrderItemId INT ) Oh no. DECLARE @tblReturn3 TABLE ( intOrderItemId INT ) Oh no no no. DECLARE @tblReturn4 TABLE ( intOrderItemId INT ) This doesn't bode well. So they've declared five variables called tblReturn, that all hold the same data structure. What happens next? This next block is gonna be long. INSERT INTO @tblReturn --(intOrderItemId) VALUES (@_ordersToBeAllocated) /* OrderItemsPlaced */ select intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..Orders o inner join CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi on oi.intOrderId = o.intOrderId where o.dtmTimeStamp between @startDate and @endDate AND intOrderItemId Not In ( /* _itemsOnBackorder */ select intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi inner join CompanyDatabase..Orders o on o.intOrderId = oi.intOrderId where o.dtmTimeStamp between @startDate and @endDate and oi.strstatus='backordered' ) AND intOrderItemId Not In ( /* _itemsOnHold */ select intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi inner join CompanyDatabase..Orders o on o.intOrderId = oi.intOrderId where o.dtmTimeStamp between @startDate and @endDate and o.strstatus='ONHOLD' and oi.strStatus \u003c\u003e 'BACKORDERED' ) AND intOrderItemId Not In ( /* _itemsOnReview */ select intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi inner join CompanyDatabase..Orders o on o.intOrderId = oi.intOrderId where o.dtmTimeStamp between @startDate and @endDate and o.strstatus='REVIEW' and oi.strStatus \u003c\u003e 'BACKORDERED' ) AND intOrderItemId Not In ( /*_itemsOnPending*/ select intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi inner join CompanyDatabase..Orders o on o.intOrderId = oi.intOrderId where o.dtmTimeStamp between @startDate and @endDate and o.strstatus='PENDING' and oi.strStatus \u003c\u003e 'BACKORDERED' ) AND intOrderItemId Not In ( /*_itemsCancelled */ select intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi inner join CompanyDatabase..Orders o on o.intOrderId = oi.intOrderId where o.dtmTimeStamp between @startDate and @endDate and oi.strstatus='CANCELLED' ) We insert into @tblReturn the result of a query, and this query relies heavily on using a big pile of subqueries to decide if a record should be included in the output- but these subqueries all query the same tables as the root query. I'm fairly certain this could be a simple join with a pretty readable where clause, but I'm also not going to sit here and rewrite it right now, we've got a lot more query to look at. INSERT INTO @tblReturn1 /* _backOrderItemsReleased */ select intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi inner join CompanyDatabase..orders o on o.intorderid = oi.intorderid where oi.intOrderItemid in ( select intRecordID from CompanyDatabase..StatusChangeLog where strRecordType = 'OrderItem' and strOldStatus in ('BACKORDERED') and strNewStatus in ('NEW', 'RECYCLED') and dtmTimeStamp between @startDate and @endDate ) and o.dtmTimeStamp \u003c @startDate UNION ( /*_pendingHoldItemsReleased*/ select intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi inner join CompanyDatabase..orders o on o.intorderid = oi.intorderid where oi.intOrderID in ( select intRecordID from CompanyDatabase..StatusChangeLog where strRecordType = 'Order' and strOldStatus in ('REVIEW', 'ONHOLD', 'PENDING') and strNewStatus in ('NEW', 'PROCESSING') and dtmTimeStamp between @startDate and @endDate ) and o.dtmTimeStamp \u003c @startDate ) UNION /* _reallocationsowingtonostock */ ( select oi.intOrderItemID from CompanyDatabase.dbo.StatusChangeLog inner join CompanyDatabase.dbo.OrderItems oi on oi.intOrderItemID = CompanyDatabase.dbo.StatusChangeLog.intRecordID inner join CompanyDatabase.dbo.Orders o on o.intOrderId = oi.intOrderId where strOldStatus = 'RECYCLED' and strNewStatus = 'ALLOCATED' and CompanyDatabase.dbo.StatusChangeLog.dtmTimestamp \u003e @endDate and strRecordType = 'OrderItem' and intRecordId in ( select intRecordId from CompanyDatabase.dbo.StatusChangeLog where strOldStatus = 'ALLOCATED' and strNewStatus = 'RECYCLED' and strRecordType = 'OrderItem' and CompanyDatabase.dbo.StatusChangeLog.dtmTimestamp between @startDate and @endDate ) ) Okay, just some unions with more subquery filtering. More of the same. It's the next one that makes this special. INSERT INTO @tblReturn2 SELECT intOrderItemId FROM @tblReturn UNION SELECT intOrderItemId FROM @tblReturn1 Ah, here's the stuff. This is just bonkers. If the goal is to combine the results of these queries into a single table, you could just insert into one table the whole time. But we know that there are 5 of these tables, so why are we only going through the first two to combine them at this point? INSERT INTO @tblReturn3 /* _factoryAllocation*/ select oi.intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..Shipments s inner join CompanyDatabase..ShipmentItems si on si.intShipmentID = s.intShipmentID inner join Common.CompanyDatabase.Stores stores on stores.intStoreID = s.intLocationID inner join CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi on oi.intOrderItemId = si.intOrderItemId inner join CompanyDatabase..Orders o on o.intOrderId = s.intOrderId where s.dtmTimestamp \u003e= @endDate and stores.strLocationType = 'FACTORY' UNION ( /*_storeAllocations*/ select oi.intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..Shipments s inner join CompanyDatabase..ShipmentItems si on si.intShipmentID = s.intShipmentID inner join Common.CompanyDatabase.Stores stores on stores.intStoreID = s.intLocationID inner join CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi on oi.intOrderItemId = si.intOrderItemId inner join CompanyDatabase..Orders o on o.intOrderId = s.intOrderId where s.dtmTimestamp \u003e= @endDate and stores.strLocationType \u003c\u003e 'FACTORY' ) UNION ( /* _ordersWithAllocationProblems */ select oi.intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase.dbo.StatusChangeLog inner join CompanyDatabase.dbo.OrderItems oi on oi.intOrderItemID = CompanyDatabase.dbo.StatusChangeLog.intRecordID inner join CompanyDatabase.dbo.Orders o on o.intOrderId = oi.intOrderId where strRecordType = 'orderitem' and strNewStatus = 'PROBLEM' and strOldStatus = 'NEW' and CompanyDatabase.dbo.StatusChangeLog.dtmTimestamp \u003e @endDate and o.dtmTimestamp \u003c @endDate ) Okay, @tblReturn3 is more of the same. Nothing more to really add. INSERT INTO @tblReturn4 SELECT intOrderItemId FROM @tblReturn2 WHERE intOrderItemId NOT IN(SELECT intOrderItemId FROM @tblReturn3 ) Ooh, but here we see something a bit different- we're taking the set difference between @tblReturn2 and @tblReturn3. This would almost make sense if there weren't already set operations in T-SQL which would handle all of this. Which brings us, finally, to the last query in the whole thing: SELECT o.intOrderId ,oi.intOrderItemId ,o.dtmDate ,oi.strDescription ,o.strFirstName + o.strLastName AS 'Name' ,o.strEmail ,o.strBillingCountry ,o.strShippingCountry FROM CompanyDatabase.dbo.OrderItems oi INNER JOIN CompanyDatabase.dbo.Orders o on o.intOrderId = oi.intOrderId WHERE oi.intOrderItemId IN (SELECT intOrderItemId FROM @tblReturn4) END At the end of all this, I've determined a few things. First, the developer responsible didn't understand table variables. Second,they definitely didn't understand joins. Third, they had no sense of the overall workflow of this query and just sorta fumbled through until they got results that the client said were okay. And somehow, this pile of trash made it through a code review by internal architects and got deployed to production, where it promptly became the worst performing query in their application. Correction: the worst performing query thus far. [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands. Download today!",

    "description": "Many years ago, JP joined a Ruby project. This was in the heyday of Ruby, when every startup on Earth was using it, and if you weren't building your app on Rails, were you even building an app? Now, Ruby offers a lot of flexibility. One might argue that it offers too much flexibility, especially insofar as it permits \"monkey patching\": you can always add new methods to an existing class, if you want. Regardless of the technical details, JP and the team saw that massive flexibility and said, \"Yes, we should use that. All of it!\" As these stories usually go, that was fine- for awhile. Then one day, a test started failing because a class name wasn't defined. That was already odd, but what was even odder is that when they searched through the code, that class name wasn't actually used anywhere. So yes, there was definitely no class with that name, but also, there was no line of code that was trying to instantiate that class. So where was the problem? def controller_class(name) \"#{settings.app_name.camelize}::Controllers\".constantize.const_get(\"#{name.to_s.camelize}\") end def model_class(name) \"#{settings.app_name.camelize}\".constantize.const_get(\"#{name.to_s.camelize}\") end def resource_class(name) \"#{settings.app_name.camelize}Client\".constantize.const_get(\"#{name.to_s.camelize}\") end It happened because they were dynamically constructing the class names from a settings field. And not just in this handful of lines- this pattern occurred all over the codebase. There were other places where it referenced a different settings field, and they just hadn't encountered the bug yet, but knew that it was only a matter of time before changing a settings file was going to break more functionality in the application. They wisely rewrote these sections to not reference the settings, and dubbed the pattern the \"Caramelize Pattern\". They added that to their coding standards as a thing to avoid, and learned a valuable lesson about how languages provide footguns. Since today's April Fool's Day, consider the prank the fact that everyone learned their lesson and corrected their mistakes. I suppose that has to happen at least sometimes.
