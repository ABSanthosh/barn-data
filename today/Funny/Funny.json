    "description": "We've all kept secrets for our siblings. Whether that be covering for them when they sneak out of the house or fixing mom's broken vase before she gets home so no one gets in trouble; sibling solidarity is one of the firmest bonds we can have. That said, we've also all tattled on a sibling in a moment of weakness. Younger siblings are known to be the bigger tattlers since they remain in the light of our parent's affection for much longer. It's always an advantage to be the baby of the family, even if you're stuck at home the longest while everyone else gets to leave.Once we reach adulthood, the instinct to tattle on our siblings mostly washes away. Sibling solidarity, however, remains forever. I know I would help my sister with anything, no questions asked. However, there are some things in life that are hard to forgive. One woman is in a tough position with her sister after her sister confides in her about her infidelity. She comes to Reddit to ask for advice after she reveals the family secret. Would you have spilled in this situation? Or is this a subject that's better left to the parties involved to deal with?",

    "description": "If you get to the point in a relationship where you're forced to give your partner an ultimatum, you might as well throw in the towel right then and there. It shouldn't have to be a completely life-changing decision to get what you need, and if you aren't getting what you need, you should probably just get up and go! Sure, the pressure of an ultimatum could help you achieve happiness faster, but couldn't you flip a coin, too? Makes a pros and cons list? Maybe this is an unpopular opinion to have, but ultimatums feel like the option for people who haven't made a single decision for themselves in their lives.There are situations, too, that are too delicate for people to be throwing ultimatums around. Take this man, for example, whose wife made him the ultimatum of either adopting his daughter so his ex-wife and mother of his child stay out of their lives for good or getting a divorce. Honey, if you were that pressed about an ex being involved, you should've thought about that before you married a man with a kid! But I digress… why don't you read their story and make your opinion on ultimatums, et. al.",

And how about that board game night you have been planning for months? Did your cat eat the dice again…? Besides a recommendation to have a vet check-up at this point, for us it sounds about right - every geeky cat pawrent deals with these situations. But what can we do? We love our cat dearly, but also Balthazor, our level 14 orc warlock that we play with our group of D\u0026D friends. He also has a cat familiar.But, you know? There are plenty of wholesome moments that involve a geeky lifestyle with cat pawrenting. You probably experienced cozying up in a favorite spot with a favorite book, and your cat comes up to snuggle on your lap. Or you make a geeky movie night with friends, and your cat comes to you all to make biscuits on the couch. These are some of our favorite feline moments, truly.",

We are currently snuggled up on our couch, surrounded by blankets and fluffy felines, wishing we were somewhere warmer (with our cats, of course). Doesn't a vacation sound just purrfect right now? Some nice, tropical beach or a city where it's above freezing will do. Actually, we'll go anywhere where we're not 2-feet-deep in snow. If we have the chance to encounter the cat distribution system, even better. It's important to always be prepurred to welcome a new kitty into your life. Even when you're on vacation. When you see a cat in need, you don't think, you just do. And that's exactly what this loving cat mom did! She found a Siamese kitten in a kitten mill and immediately scooped her up and adopted her. They traveled back to the US together, and now they're one big, fluffy feline family. She got a trip to Mexico and cute cat? We're just a little bit jealous. Okay, more than a little bit.

    "description": "A Representative Line is a short snippet that makes you think, \"wow, I'd hate to see the rest of the code.\" A CodeSOD is a longer snippet, which also frequently makes you think, \"wow, I'd hate to see the rest of the code,\" but also is bad in ways that require you to look at the relationship between the lines in the code. I bring that up, because today's code sample is a long section, but really, it's just a collection of representative lines. Each line in this just makes me die a little on the inside. Belda found this: ## helper functions function stripmagic($x) { return get_magic_quotes_gpc() ? stripslashes($x) : $x; } function pre_r(\u0026$x) { return ''.PHSC(print_r($x, true)).''; } function PSS($x) { return str_replace('\\\\\"','\"',$x); } function PVS($x) { return preg_replace(\"/\\n[^\\\\S\\n]*(?=\\n)/\", \"\\n\u003c:vspace\u003e\", $x); } function PVSE($x) { return PVS(PHSC($x, ENT_NOQUOTES)); } function PZZ($x,$y='') { return ''; } function PRR($x=NULL) { if ($x || is_null($x)) $GLOBALS['RedoMarkupLine']++; return $x; } function PUE($x) { return preg_replace('/[\\\\x80-\\\\xff \\'\"\u003c\u003e]/e', \"'%'.dechex(ord('$0'))\", $x); } function SDV(\u0026$v,$x) { if (!isset($v)) $v=$x; } function SDVA(\u0026$var,$val) { foreach($val as $k=\u003e$v) if (!isset($var[$k])) $var[$k]=$v; } This collection of one-line \"helper\" functions has it all. Cryptic function names. PRR mutates global variables. PZZ just… returns an empty string. I don't know what PHSC does, and I don't want to, but it's called inside of pre_r and PVSE. Which I also don't know what they do. Speaking of PVSE, I note the regex is using backreferences, which is some advanced regex but I still have no idea what it's doing. I could figure it out, but I don't want to. PUE looks like it might be handling some misencoded characters, maybe. SDV is maybe kinda a coalesce function. Each line is its own representative line. None of this is code I'd want to maintain. On the flip side, the abbreviated function names, when read in reverse order, are exactly the sounds I made when I read this code: \"SDVASDVPUEPRRPZZPVSEPVSPSS\". It's okay, the doctors say I'll make a full recovery.
