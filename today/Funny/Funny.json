    "description": "All the corporate world's a stage and we're all just actors trying to balance our ethical standards with our deep-seated desire to finally afford that fancy coffee maker we've been eyeing. It's like finding money in the street except the street is your paycheck, and there are security cameras everywhere.You know how they say good things come to those who wait? Well, sometimes they also come to those who accidentally receive payroll errors, leaving them trapped in a moral maze of their own sweaty-palmed making.Let's talk about someone who recently stumbled into the workplace equivalent of finding an extra $20 in their jeans - except it's every single paycheck. Our honest worker asked for a raise and was offered the somewhat insulting sum of 50 cents. But through what can only be described as divine intervention (or more likely, Karen from payroll having a particularly distracted Monday), they received a $4 raise instead.Now, while some might view this as karmic justice for all those unpaid overtime hours and missed lunch breaks, our conflicted friend is wrestling with their conscience. There's no paper trail, no signed documents, just an unexpected windfall that could disappear as quickly as it arrived.",

    "description": "Working too much is just not good for anyone. Even the most resilient employee starts to wilt if they're not given proper rest time. Working is supposed to be just one portion of your life. You're supposed to be able to clock out and spend time with family and friends, sleep, cook some nice meals, and maybe read or watch TV before you start it all over again. If you've ever spent time with someone who's overworking themself, you can see the toll it takes. When all you're thinking about is your boss, your customers, and your clients, you get weary down to your bones. It's one thing to be physically tired, but when you don't have time to remember what makes life worth living, you get tired psychologically, too. Burnout is sure to follow. Just ask this person, whose boss literally asked them to work for three weeks straight! Commenters advised them not to do that, and some offered up some alternative messages for them to send back to the boss. After that, read these unforgettably bad job interviews, like one hiring manager who was bemused to discover that they 'Interviewed someone who... technically wasn't allowed to be in the building.'",

    "description": "Hey there, cat lovers and feline enthusiasts! Today, we are taking a journey through the whimsical world of the liquid-to-solid spectrum, with extra emphasis on the feline experience. Cats are amazingly able to defy the laws of physics and transform into puddles—or whatever shape they need to take to get from point A to point B—blurring the boundaries of feline physics with their liquid-solid spectrum antics. We've got to give it up for cats. Their flexibility is simply inspiring. We humans struggle to merely bend over to tie our shoes.One such liquid feline has mastered the art of sneaking into his neighbor's house. Well, it's not so much \"sneaking\" because he does it with no shame at all, in broad daylight. Because he does not give a hoot about what his neighbor thinks about these guest appearances, as far as the cat is concerned, he is the true owner of his neighbor's house. The neighbor should really be thanking Mr. Liquid Cat for allowing him to continue residing in Mr. Cat's part-time home. Read on for all the details!",

    "description": "We have a confession to make, feline fam…we finally went and adopted a Maine Coon cat. We have wanted one all of our lives, and we finally did it. There is just something so meowgical about these majestic fluffy felines. They are more like living room lions than they are cats, but snuggly ones. We have definitely seen some noticeable differences between this awwdorable Maine Coon kitten and our previous kittens, like fur example, this kitten is very active. Like, hyperactive. He always wants to play…all the time.Since we've got Maine Coons on our mind, we thought it would be nice to collect a stunning series of marvelously meowjestic and regal Maine Coon cats, but in their giant kitten form. Yes, they are even large as kittens. He barely fits in two hands…and he's only a few months old! Scroll down to see these purrfect pictures of pawdorable cats, you know you can't resist floofy kittens. At least, we can't!",

I think there's too much texture, too much detail for a single person and I am prepared to sign up for either side of the dyad.

    "description": "I'm a JSON curmudgeon, in that I think that its type-system, inherited from JavaScript, is bad. It's a limited vocabulary of types, and it forces developers to play odd games of convention. For example, because it lacks any sort of date type, you either have to explode your date out as a sub-dictionary (arguably, the \"right\" approach) or do what most people do- use an ISO formatted string as your date. The latter version requires you to attempt to parse the sting to validate the data, but validating JSON is a whole thing anyway. But, enough about me being old and cranky. Do you know one type JSON supports? Boolean values. Which is why this specification from today's anonymous submitter annoys me so much: field: sw_auto_update type: string valid values: /(on)|(off)/ field: data_auto_update type: string valid values: /(on)|(off)/ field: spanning_tree_protocol type: string valid values: /(on)|(off)/ Their custom validator absolutely requires the use of strings, and absolutely requires that they have these values. Sending a boolean, or worse, the string \"true\" causes the request to get rejected. Our submitter doesn't explain why it's this way, but I have a strong suspicion that it's because it was originally designed to support a form submission with radio buttons. The form is long gone, but the API contract remains. [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod. Restrict NuGet feed privileges with ProGet. Learn more.",
