He snuggles up next to you, in his fluffy feline fashion, sending one of his front legs towards you and paws you gently. Isn't that just the cutest, most wholesome thing a cat pawrent can expurrience? Just a smol touch of a cat's paw. It can change a day's mood, it can make any humble hooman happy for a long time. It's like a tiny imprint of bliss.We want to help any hooman experience this meowgnificent moment, even if they're not cat pawrents - so we turned to the next best thing, which is also so easy to transfer to any feline fan - cat memes. And not just any cat memes - toe beans and paws. These memes are like a cat pawing at you gently, wholesome but full of humor all hoomans can harvest.",

To be fair, that's what we want to do every day, but especially on this cold, wintery Tuesday. If we could pick our purrfect cuddle puddle, it would be with a family of cheetahs. It would be like cuddling with a great dane, but better, because it would be a giant cat that meows and purrs. Just imagine how soft it would be. Just imagine purrs from a 120 lb. cat…it must be meowgical. Now, multiply that by three, and you've successfully managed to expurrience what the hooman guard in this video gets to enjoy every night. He guards a family of cheetahs at a wildlife reserve, and while sleeping under the stars, the large feline family snuck in for a cuddle puddle overnight, showcasing the heartwarming connections pawssible between hoomans and animals.

    "description": "Never mess with the person who makes your food. Any adult should be grateful when another person cooks for them, so insulting their culinary skills on top of that is just playing with fire–or, in this place, hot chili oil. This spicy Gen X mom was tired of dealing with her son's complaints about her 'bland' cooking, so without hesitation, she taught him a lesson, making him eat his own words... on the Scoville Scale. Spicy food is special in my heart, but my mouth can't handle it. I can have 1-3 bites of something really spicy–like Thai food rated 9 or 10–and I've got to take a few breaks. Considering a glass of milk from the fridge, I often dream of ways to get around my tender-mouthed tendencies with no success. Turns out, my palate craves the blandness as much as my soul craves the spice. This was the case for the entitled 27-year-old in this next tale who couldn't put his money where his mouth was and paid the price–and with a gallon of dairy and some memorable chemical burns in his mouth, he learned his lesson.",

    "description": "Roger took on a contract to fix up a PHP website. During the negotiations, he asked some questions about the design, like, \"Is it object-oriented or more procedural?\" \"No, it's PHP,\" said the developer. Which about sums it up, I suppose. Have some date handling code: function MnameToMnumber($mname) //takes month name 'January' and returns month number '01' { if($mname == 'January'){$mnum = '01';} elseif($mname == 'February'){$mnum = '02';} elseif($mname == 'March'){$mnum = '03';} elseif($mname == 'April'){$mnum = '04';} elseif($mname == 'May'){$mnum = '05';} elseif($mname == 'June'){$mnum = '06';} elseif($mname == 'July'){$mnum = '07';} elseif($mname == 'August'){$mnum = '08';} elseif($mname == 'September'){$mnum = '09';} elseif($mname == 'October'){$mnum = '10';} elseif($mname == 'November'){$mnum = '11';} elseif($mname == 'December'){$mnum = '12';} return $mnum; } function MnumberToMname($mname) //takes month number '01' and returns month name '01' { if($mnum= '01'){$mname = 'January';} elseif($mnum= '02'){$mname = 'February';} elseif($mnum= '03'){$mname = 'March';} elseif($mname == 'April'){$mnum = '04';} elseif($mnum= '05'){$mname = 'May';} elseif($mnum= '06'){$mname = 'June';} elseif($mnum= '07'){$mname = 'July';} elseif($mnum= '08'){$mname = 'August';} elseif($mnum= '09'){$mname = 'September';} elseif($mnum= '10'){$mname = 'October';} elseif($mnum= '11'){$mname = 'November';} elseif($mnum= '12'){$mname = 'December';} return $mname; } So, for starters, I \"love\" the use of Whitesmiths indenting. I don't think I've seen this in the wild. (I predict the comments section will be links to articles where I have seen this in the wild). Beyond that, there's nothing terribly surprising here, in terms of bad date handling code, with a few small exceptions. First is their insistence on the conversion itself being stringly typed: January isn't month 1, but \"01\". But more notable: MnumberToMname just doesn't work. They're using the assignment operator instead of the equality operator. At least, for all the cases where they're doing the correct comparison direction. A stray \"name to number\" conversion is lurking in April. Not that it matters- this will always return January. [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.

    "description": "Keige inherited some code which seems to be part of a drawing application. It can load brush textures from image files- at least, sometimes it can. static public Brush GetImageBrush(string serviceCode, string imageName, string language) { Brush BorderChannelGroupBrush; BitmapImage image = null; int point = imageName.LastIndexOf('.'); string languageImagename = imageName.Substring(0, point) + \"-\" + language + imageName.Substring(point); try { image = FrameWork.ServicePageImageUrlOnContentServer(serviceCode, languageImagename); } catch { } if (image == null) { try { image = FrameWork.ServicePageImageUrlOnContentServer(serviceCode, imageName); } catch { } } if (image != null) { BorderChannelGroupBrush = new ImageBrush(image); } else { BorderChannelGroupBrush = Brushes.White; } return BorderChannelGroupBrush; } There are a lot of interesting \"choices\" made in this code. First, there's the old \"find the last '.'\" approach of grabbing the file extension. Which is fine, but there's a built-in which handles cases like when there isn't an extension better. I think, in this case, it probably doesn't hurt anything. But the real fun starts with our first attempt at loading our image. We jam a localized language string in the middle of the file name (foo-en.jpg), and try and fetch that from the server. If this fails, it throws an exception… which we ignore. But we don't fully ignore it! If the exception was thrown, image doesn't get set, so it's still null. So we do a null check, and repeat our empty exception handler. If the image is still null after that, we default to a \"Brushes.White\" image. It's all a very awkward and weird way to handle errors. The null checks bring with them the whiff of a C programmer checking return codes, but I don't actually think that's what happened here. I think this was just someone not fully understanding the problem they were trying to solve or the tools available to them. Or maybe they just really didn't want to deal with nesting. It's hardly the worst code, but it does just leave me feeling weird when I look at it.
