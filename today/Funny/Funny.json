    "description": "In the world we live in now, it's hard to find a place to live all to yourself. Rents are too expensive to be living alone, so that's why so many people end up having to find a roommate. Besides, if you're moving to a new place, it's good to have a built-in friend as soon as you get there, anyway. Part of having a roommate is maintaining good roommate etiquette, and it's good to find someone whose lifestyle lines up well with yours. Are you a messy person? Are you a night owl? These are all things that might make a difference in helping you to choose the person you'll be sharing your living space with. If you live with someone long enough, you're sure to get a full understanding of their quirks and habits. Sometimes, however, a person can surprise us, even years into living with them. One man experienced just that, when his roommate of five years got a new girlfriend and suddenly spent all his time with her. So, is it in this man's right to draw some boundaries as to when his roommate's girlfriend can be in the house? Or do they both have the right to do what they want with the space they're paying for?",

    "description": "The corporate world has a time-honored tradition that mirrors the old prison yard rule: new managers, like fresh inmates, must establish dominance on day one. While prisoners might pick fights in the yard, new bosses hunt for imaginary problems to solve, targeting successful employees like seasoned inmates target the unaffiliated.It's about marking territory, showing strength, and making sure everyone knows there's a new sheriff in town.Both scenarios follow the same playbook: identify your target, isolate them from allies, create problems where none existed, and make an example that keeps others in line. While prison requires physical intimidation, corporate warfare relies on Performance Improvement Plans and vague accusations of inadequacy.Our latest victim enjoyed three peaceful years at their dream job until the new sheriff rode into town, guns blazing with promises of revolutionary leadership.",

And for you and us? It's an even more difficult burden to bear. Why? Because we're all cat pawrents. Having a cat as your lovely fluffy companion at home, means you need to experience every Monday morning after you've spent a whole wholesome weekend with your cat. Two days full of feline fluff - what a blissful existence. And then comes Monday and it's all gone. Just like that, with no warning.But imagine this: It's a Monday morning, and you're all prepped and ready to leave the house to start another workweek, but your cat sits on your lap. That's it, it's over, you cannot move. It's illegal to move once a cat has sat on your lap. If you move an inch we'd have to call the pawlice on you. So, you know what you have to do now, right? You need to call your workplace and tell them you cannot come in. Your Monday morning problem is no more. Now pet the cat.",

    "description": "Gaining a feral cat's trust is a difficult thing to do. Not every street cat is as cute as those ones who run up to you and thank you for every bit of attention. Some of them are tougher cookies. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't try. It's a good thing we're crazy cat people though. We don't have to explain to our ICHC audience that they should try to pet every street cat that they see, because y'all already do it. So you know that some cats take longer to trust humans, and you know why it's worth it to gain their trust anyway. It's because moments like these can happen. Two years it took for this cat to let this human pet it. Two whole years. And it was worth every moment of it. Because when this cat needed help - when he needed someone to save it, he knew exactly who to go to. He knew who was kind to him and who was not. And because of that - because of all the hard work that was put in to gain this cat's trust, now, he has a loving, warm home to live in.",

The work we were trying to do was text and images, which the Internet of the time was adept at - it would take a little longer for people making music, video, or games to get the same opportunity. This meant that \"distribution,\" previously a very thorny concept, could be a couple badly formatted tables and an FTP client. We still managed to find abuse at the hands of various demons trying to get paid for it, but this new problem is at least a novel one and the old one was gone forever.",

He wouldn't respond to PR comments, however, and just wait until management needed the feature merged badly enough that someone said, \"just approve it so we can move on.\" .comment {border: none;} int iDisplayFlags = objectProps.DisplayInfo.BackgroundPrintFlags; bool bForceBackgroundOn = false; bool bForceBackgroundOff = false; // Can't use _displayTypeID because it will always be 21 since text displays as image if (_fileTypeID == 11) // TEXT { if ((iDisplayFlags \u0026 0x1008) != 0) // Text Background is required { bForceBackgroundOn = true; } else if ((iDisplayFlags \u0026 0x1001) != 0) // Text Background is not available { bForceBackgroundOff = true; } } else if (_displayTypeID == 21) // IMAGE { if ((iDisplayFlags \u0026 0x1200) != 0) // Image Background is required { bForceBackgroundOn = true; } else if ((iDisplayFlags \u0026 0x1040) != 0) // Image Background is not available { bForceBackgroundOff = true; } } bool useBackground = bForceBackgroundOn; // If an object does not have an Background and we try to use it, bad things happen. // So we check to see if we really have an Background, if not we don't want to try and use it if (!useBackground \u0026\u0026 objectProps.DisplayInfo.Background) { useBackground = Convert.ToBoolean(BackgroundShown); } if (bForceBackgroundOff) { useBackground = false; } This code is inside of a document viewer application. As you might gather from skimming it, the viewer will display text (as an image) or images (as an image) and may or may not display a background as part of it. This code, of course, uses a bunch of magic numbers and bitwise operators, which is always fun. We don't need any constants. It's important to note that all the other developers on the project did use enumerations and constants. The values were defined and well organized in the code- Stuart simply chose not to use them. You'll note that there's some comments and confusion about how we can't use _displayTypeID because text always displays as an image. I'm going to let Andrew explain this: The client this code exists in renders text documents to images (for reasons that aren’t relevant) when presenting them to the user. We have a multitude of filetypes that we do similar actions with, and fileTypes are user configurable. Because of this, we also keep track of the display type. This allows the user to configure a multitude of filetypes, and depending on the display type configured for the file type, we know if we can show it in our viewer. In the case of display type ‘text’ our viewer ultimately renders the text as an image. At some point in time Stuart decided that since the final product of a text document is an image, we should convert display type text over to image when referencing it in code (hence the comment ‘Can’t use display type ID’). If none of this paragraph makes any sense to you, then you’re not alone, because the second someone competent got wind of this, they thankfully nixed the idea and display type text, went back to meaning display type text (aka this goes through OUR TEXT RENDERER). What I get from that paragraph is that none of this makes sense, but it's all Stuart's fault. What makes this special is that the developer is writing code to control a binary status: \"do we show a background or not?\", but needs two booleans to handle this case. We have a bForceBackgroundOn and a bForceBackgroundOff. So, tracing through, if we're text and any of the bits 0x1008 are set in iDisplayFlags, we want the background on. Otherwise, if any of the bits 0x1001 are set, we want to force the background off. If it's an image, we do the same thing, though for 0x1200 and 0x1040 respectively. Then, we stuff bForceBackgroundOn into a different variable, useBackground. If that is false and a different property flag is set, we'll check the value of BackgroundShown- which we choose to convert to boolean which implies that it isn't a boolean, which raises its own questions, except it actually is a boolean value, and Stuart just didn't understand how to deal with a nullable boolean. Finally, after all this work, we check the bForceBackgroundOff value, and if that's true, we set useBackground to false. I'll be frank, none of this quite makes sense to me, and I can certainly imagine a world where the convoluted process of having a \"on\" and \"forceOff\" variable actually makes sense, so I'd almost think this code isn't that bad- except for this little detail, from Andrew: The final coup de grace is that all of the twisted logic for determining if the background is needed is completely unnecessary. When the call to retrieve the file to display is made, another method checks to see if the background was requested (useBackground), and performs the same logic check (albeit in a sane manner) as above. The code is confusing and unnecessary. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time. Download our guide to learn the best practice of NuGet for the Enterprise.",
