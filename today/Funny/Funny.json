    "description": "Working retail is a hectic and endless stream of customer interactions that balance on a knife's edge, with any one of them threatening to teeter off into a full-blown customer meltdown with possibly little to no cause. It's a way of living that leaves you emotionally drained and completely exasperated, while weekends end up giving you just enough time to self-isolate and prepare for your next shift.Meanwhile, despite claiming to have the customer's best interest at heart, upper management makes decisions that only serve to maximize their own bonuses and profit, putting you directly in the firing line for even more hostile interactions with customers. They'll enact some broad-sweeping policy that flies in the face of logical reason and expect you to follow it to the letter, vaguely implying serious consequences should you not blindly obey and refuse to listen to the insistence of everyone that their plan is a bad one. Then, acting like it's the worker's fault when they receive customer complaints about their policy. That's what this retail worker shared experiencing when they recounted this story from their days in retail, facing down belligerent customers whilst handling bizarre directives from their superiors.",

    "description": "The entire family is giving this woman the side-eye after she did something strange during a gift exchange. Instead of getting an individual present for every member of your family, some families choose to do Secret Santa gift exchanges. It's a good way to add some fun to the typical present exchange. Everyone is assigned a family member to gift a nice present to in secret. Then, when the present is opened, the person usually finds out who gave it to them. It's a sweet tradition that allows each person to be really thoughtful about their present without breaking the bank. After all, it can be way easier to give one $50 present to one person rather than 10 or 15 individual gifts to everyone in the family. This person is being called out for acting a bit stingy. If she was having financial trouble, maybe she should've quietly talked to the Secret Santa organizer. Instead, money troubles or not, she's making a bad impression on everyone else, and commenters agreed that what she did was kind of tacky. Up next, this neighbor decided that she had an issue with one family's boat: it was in view, so she decided it had to be moved ASAP.",

Add to that micromanagers dumping deadlines on you left and right, and you are in for quite the unpleasant and busy day that has got your hanger huffing and puffing its way towards exploding.But you have nothing to fear for we have enlisted the help of the Guardians of the Food Bowl, who are a feisty feline crew, hell-bent on pawtecting your food from thieves.

The couldn't afford taking care of a cat anymore, they found out they were allergic… there are all kinds of reasons. At least everyone who returns a cat is a heartbroken, at least that's what we thought. We never imagined that someone would do it because the cat they adopted wanted to cuddle with them at nighttime. Everyone wants a velcro cat, right? Cuddly cats are the best! Cuddling with your cat is one of the best feelings in the world. The trust they show you, the love, the calmness that being so close to them gives you… there is nothing quite like it. To complain about a cat being too cuddly is like complaining about something being too tasty. It's silly. And ridiculous. And thank goodness that this sweet girl is now in the hands of someone who actually deserves her.",

The most common rejoinder I hear from people who washed out of it has to do with the sheer number of champions - I mean heroes, I mean Operators - you have to contend with. It's coming up on something like eighty, but they are divided into Attackers and Defenders and I think the asymmetry helps a lot. Also, I'm a dessicated and ancient genetic doldrum and I managed to get it. It's worth a couple nights and some time on YouTube to gain entrance to the Inner Sanctum - to play a dynamic, aggressive social deduction game masquerading as a shooter.

    "description": "Some time ago, poor Keith found himself working on an antique Classic ASP codebase. Classic ASP uses VBScript, which is like VisualBasic 6.0, but worse in most ways. That's not to say that VBScript code is automatically bad, but the language certainly doesn't help you write clean code. In any case, the previous developer needed to make an 8 element array to store some data. Traditionally, in VBScript, you might declare it like so: Dim params(8) That's the easy, obvious way a normal developer might do it. Keith's co-worker did this instead: Dim params : params = Split(\",,,,,,,\", \",\") Yes, this creates an array using the Split function on a string of only commas. 7, to be exact. Which, when split, creates 8 empty substrings. We make fun of stringly typed data a lot here, but this is an entirely new level of stringly typed initialization. We can only hope that this code has finally been retired, but given that it was still in use well past the end-of-life for Classic ASP, it may continue to lurk out there, waiting for another hapless developer to stumble into its grasp.

    "description": "Ross needed to write software to integrate with a credit card payment gateway. The one his company chose was relatively small, and only served a handful of countries- but it covered the markets they cared about and the transaction fees were cheap. They used XML for data interchange, and while they had no published schema document, they did have some handy-dandy sample code which let you parse their XML messages. $response = curl_exec($ch); $authecode = fetch_data($response, '', ''); $responsecode = fetch_data($response, '', ''); $retrunamount = fetch_data($response, '', ''); $trxnnumber = fetch_data($response, '', ''); $trxnstatus = fetch_data($response, '', ''); $trxnresponsemessage = fetch_data($response, '', ''); Well, this looks… worrying. At first glance, I wonder if we're going to have to kneel before Z̸̭͖͔͂̀ā̸̡͖͕͊l̴̜͕͋͌̕g̸͉̳͂͊ȯ̷͙͂̐. What exactly does fetch_data actually do? function fetch_data($string, $start_tag, $end_tag) { $position = stripos($string, $start_tag); $str = substr($string, $position); $str_second = substr($str, strlen($start_tag)); $second_positon = stripos($str_second, $end_tag); $str_third = substr($str_second, 0, $second_positon); $fetch_data = trim($str_third); return $fetch_data; } Phew, no regular expressions, just… lots of substrings. This parses the XML document with no sense of the document's structure- it literally just searches for specific tags, grabs whatever is between them, and calls it done. Nested tags? Attributes? Self-closing tags? Forget about it. Since it doesn't enforce that your open and closing tags match, it also lets you grab arbitrary (and invalid) document fragments- fetch_data($response, \"\", \"\"), for example. And it's not like this needs to be implemented from scratch- PHP has built-in XML parsing classes. We could argue that by limiting ourselves to a subset of XML (which I can only hope this document does) and doing basic string parsing, we've built a much simpler approach, but I suspect that after doing a big pile of linear searches through the document, we're not really going to see any performance benefits from this version- and maintenance is going to be a nightmare, as it's so fragile and won't work for many very valid XML documents. It's always amazing when TRWTF is neither PHP nor XML but… whatever this is.
