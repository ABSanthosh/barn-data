    "description": "Hello, fellow employees, it's time for another day of corporate purgatory. It's the same every single day, like we're living in a never-ending Black Mirror episode. We wake up, contemplate whether or not to call in sick, decide not to, stumble in late to work anyway, and end up sitting at our desks getting paid to send emails and watch the grueling minutes tick by until 5 p.m. Then we commute home, spend the rest of the evening dreading another day of work, and repeat. If this sounds a little too relatable, you're in desperate need of some meme therapy. Make your morning a little less dreadful by checking out this compilation of memes made for those of us running on fumes. This week has been tough, to say the least, and we're still trying to adjust to the time change that snuck up on us (like it doesn't happen at the same time every year). So, let's take a collective mental reset and grab some much-needed laughs from these memes below.",

When a conniving landlord decides that they are above the law and impede on your rights as a tenant, there landlord can't expect you to keep quiet.When something seems fishy, it likely is. Always trust your intuition, but even more so, trust the evidence you have and do something with it. The more power that landlords have, the more they're willing to do whatever it takes to pull a fast one on you and every other tenant they have in the future.The tenant in this story is moving out of their unit and it is their last month paying rent. They noticed their cleaning supplies were gone from their apartment, in addition to two set of blinds and a shelf they had installed in their closet for storage purposes. They first thought their neighbor might've taken their belongings, but they noticed their landlord posted an advertisement of their unit and they had never approved of him coming in and taking photos to post on apartment-seeking websites. When they confront him, instead of fessing up, he demands they pay another month's rent. Scroll to read.",

We tried luring her to the bed with treats, playing relaxing music, and even holding her there against her will - none of it worked. Maybe our next cat will be a cuddly cat, or, we'll just live vicariously through the lives of strangers on the internet and not be jealous at all of all of their outrageously cute cuddly cats.Not only are they cuddly, but they appawrently like to cuddle right next to their pawrents' faces because they're just that silly and awwdorable. They probably can't breathe very well at night, but if that was a burden we had to bear, we would bear it with purrfect pride because it would be absolutely worth it. Enjoy this snuggly selection of cute cats competing for cuddles below, we're going to try to lure our cat into bed one more time. Have a great week!",

Like Jerry said in his post it would be hard to explain what these books are about if you are not already neck deep in 40K lore. Just know that Magnus was a good boy who was just trying to warn his Dad about something very bad that was going to happen, but instead he ended up making his Dad super mad. Like…SUPER mad. There is a saying in the community that “Magnus did nothing wrong” and while I am not sure if that’s entirely true (he did after all destroy the magical wards that protected holy Terra from the Warp), I do think he had good intentions.",

You're catching air on your jetbike in view of a passel of weird-ass moons, and even though you are an immortal space warrior you have a machine gun and a bunch of feathers poking out. In 40k, people fly around in huge churches that are so big there are people in the belly of them that think the outside world is a myth. They have Space Vikings and Space Vampires. Acquisitions Incorporated can hit some real drama precisely because it's incredbly goof troop for the majority of the runtime. Somehow, being silly in some ways - unabashed - allows Games Workshop's cadre of writers to pull out some gruesome gut punches. Magnus the Red falls in that category.",

Have you heard about the new, hot encoding standard for 2024?!\" exclaimed Daniel , kvetching \"Well, if you haven't then Gravity Forms co. is going to change your mind: URLEncode everything now! Specially if you need to display some diacritics on your website. Throw away the old, forgotten UTF-8. Be a cool guy, just use that urlencode!\"   Immediately afterward, Daniel also sent us another good example, this time from Hetzner. He complains \"Hetzner says the value is invalid. Of course they won't say what is or isn't allowed. It wasn't the slash character, it was... a character with diacritics! Hetzner is clearly using US-ASCII created in 1960's.\"   Finally this week, we pulled something out of the archive from Boule de Berlin who wrote \"Telekom, the biggest German ISP, shows email address validation is hard. They use a regex that limits the TLD part of an email address to 4 chars.\" Old but timeless.   [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds.

    "description": "Matt needed to add a new field to a form. This simple task was made complicated by the method used to save changes back to the database. Let's see if you can spot what the challenge was: public int saveQualif(String docClass, String transcomId, String cptyCod, String tradeId, String originalDealId, String codeEvent, String multiDeal, String foNumber, String codeInstrfamily, String terminationDate, String premiumAmount, String premiumCurrency, String notionalAmount, String codeCurrency, String notionalAmount2, String codeCurrency2, String fixedRate, String payout, String maType, String maDate, String isdaZoneCode, String tradeDate, String externalReference, String entityCode, String investigationFileReference, String investigationFileStartDate, String productType, String effectiveDate, String expiryDate, String paymentDate, String settInstrucTyp, String opDirection, String pdfPassword, String extlSysCod, String extlDeaId, String agrDt) throws TechnicalException, DfException That's 36 parameters right there. This function, internally, creates a data access object which takes just as many parameters in its constructor, and then does a check: if a field is non-null, it updates that field in the database, otherwise it doesn't. Of course, every single one of those parameters is stringly typed, which makes it super fun. Tracking premiumAmount and terminationDate as strings is certainly never going to lead to problems. I especially like the pdfPassword being stored, which is clearly just the low-security password meant to be used for encrypting a transaction statement or similar: \"the last 4 digits of your SSN\" or whatever. So I guess it's okay that it's being stored in the clear in the database, but also I still hate it. Do better! In any case, this function was called twice. Once from the form that Matt was editing, where every parameter was filled in. The second time, it was called like this: int nbUpdates = incoming.saveQualif(docClass, null, null, null, null, null, multiDeal, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null); As tempted as Matt was to fix this method and break it up into multiple calls or change the parameters to a set of classes or anything better, he was too concerned about breaking something and spending a lot of time on something which was meant to be a small, fast task. So like everyone who'd come before him, he just slapped in another parameter, tested it, and called it a day. Refactoring is a problem for tomorrow's developer.
