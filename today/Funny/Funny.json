    "description": "If there's one thing homeowners don't play around with, it's their property lines (and what goes on their property). If someone takes it upon themselves to start parking in a homeowner's driveway, you bet the homeowner is calling a tow truck ASAP. As they should, though. Too often these days, folks believe they're entitled to anything they want, and this often leads to a serious widespread case of entitlement that will be passed down from generation to generation. To even the score, folks who are victims of entitled people must rise to the occasion and combat their entitled ways—then share it with the rest of us because, well, it's entertaining.The homeowner in this next story uproots the freshly-planted trees that were on their property, only to find out their neighbors had planted them there because they wanted a better \"view\" from their window. So, instead of asking for permission, they planted the trees without asking and now dare to demand the homeowner compensate them for the trees lost. Nice try. Scroll to read.",

You can ask your friends to help you out and see if they can take care of your fur baby while you're away. But sometimes you don't have friend who are willing to do that or are even trustworthy with an animal's life. So what do you do instead? You hire a professional, of course! If you're going to do that, however, you have to be ready to dish out some cash. We're talking at least minimum wage! Don't be a Karen…  Oh, but look at that, even pet parents can be entitled cheapskate Karens. Here we see a couple trying to negotiate an insanely low rate for a sitter to watch their dog for four days straight. They claim that they pay \"generously\" by allowing him to eat their food and use their washer and dryer… LOL",

It is simply the nature of these things. And unfortunately in such situations we almost always turn to destructive behavior, and more often than not, it harms us rather than those around. Which is why we decided that you might manage to take a moment away from that maelstrom to indulge in some similarly destructive cattos to give the effect of looking in a mirror and watching your alternate self get into destructive situations, without you having to handle the consequences.So if you are ready to wash your hands of clawminal responsibility and pass it on to the felines who cannot be held accountable for their actions, then settle in and enjoy.",

You know, when you're moving in somewhere or when you're getting a new roommate, whether they have a cat or not. If you don't want it in your house, don't take the roommate. If you don't want roommate that will cause drama around your feline, ask about it, find out if and what they might have issues with. Seriously, we have seen so much drama that could have been avoided if only a few questions were asked. We have seen roommates lock cats in their rooms without permission. We have seen roommates get mad because they're allergic to cats even though they agreed to getting a roommate with a cat in the first place. We've seen roommates unexpectedly bring cats home even though the other roommates didn't know and didn't agree to it. Today's story… we don't know if this one could have been avoided. It seems like the roommates in question were either dumb or liars. Thankfully, the cat is okay. But really, ask some questions. Don't risk your cat.",

They never asked me to trap a monster once in the entire campaign, and then when I'm here on the off-ramp they're like \"go trap me one.\" I had to look it up online! Real tourist shit, but I just never really played that way before. Kiko was trying to talk to Gabe about it later, saying that it was simply faster to catch them and thus a more efficient use of the hunting time. It was as though Kiko was speaking in muted honks and fwonks like a jazz trumpet; like an adult in Charlie Brown. For Gabriel, \"mercy\" is a foreign tongue.",

For those few (everyone) who didn't catch the off-by-one from last week's batch, there's the clue. \"Gotta CAPTCHA 'Em All,\" puns Alex G. \"So do I select them all?\" he wondered. I think the correct answer is null.   \"What does a null eat?\" wondered B.J.H , \"and is one null invited or five?\". The first question is easily answered. NaaN, of course. Probably garlic. I would expect B.J. to already know the eating habits of a long-standing companion, so I am guessing that the whole family is not meant to tag along. Stick with just the one.   Planespotter Rick R. caught this one at the airport. \"Watching my daughter's flight from New York and got surprised by Boeing's new supersonic 737 having already arrived in DFW,\" he observed. I'm not quite sure what went wrong. It's not the most obvious time zone mistake I can imagine, but I'm pretty sure the cure is the same: all times displayed in any context that is not purely restricted to a single location (and short time frame) should explicitly include the relevant timezone.   Rob H. figures \"From my day job's MECM Software Center. It appears that autocorrect has miscalculated, because the internet cannot be calculated.\" The internet is -1.   Ending this week on a note of hope, global warrior Stewart may have just saved the planet. \"Climate change is solved. We just need to replicate the 19 March performance of my new solar panels.\" Or perhaps I miscalculated.   [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.

    "description": "Barry rolled into work at 8:30AM to see the project manager waiting at the door, wringing her hands and sweating. She paced a bit while Barry badged in, and then immediately explained the issue: Today was a major release of their new features. This wasn't just a mere software change; the new release was tied to major changes to a new product line- actual widgets rolling off an assembly line right now. And those changes didn't work. \"I thought we tested this,\" Barry said. \"We did! And Stu called in sick today!\" Stu was the senior developer on the project, who had written most of the new code. \"I talked to him for a few minutes, and he's convinced it's a data issue. Something in the metadata or something?\" \"I'll take a look,\" Barry said. He skipped grabbing a coffee from the carafe and dove straight in. Prior to the recent project, the code had looked something like this: if (IsProduct1(_productId)) _programId = 1; elseif (IsProduct2(_productId)) _programId = 2; elseif (IsProduct3(_productId)) _programId = 3; Part of the project, however, was about changing the workflow for \"Product 3\". So Stu had written this code: if (IsProduct1(_productId)) _programId = 1; else if (IsProduct2(_productId)) _programId = 2; else if (IsProduct3(_productId)) _programId = 3; DoSomethingProductId3Specific1(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific2(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific3(); Since this is C# and not Python, it took Barry all of 5 seconds to spot this and figure out what the problem was and fix it: if (IsProduct1(_productId)) { _programId = 1; } else if (IsProduct2(_productId)) { _programId = 2; } else if (IsProduct3(_productId)) { _programId = 3; DoSomethingProductId3Specific1(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific2(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific3(); } This brings us to about 8:32. Now, given the problems, Barry wasn't about to just push this change- in addition to running pipeline tests (and writing tests that Stu clearly hadn't), he pinged the head of QA to get a tester on this fix ASAP. Everyone worked quickly, and that meant by 9:30 the fix was considered good and ready to be merged in and pushed to production. Sometime in there, while waiting for a pipeline to complete, Barry managed to grab a cup of coffee to wake himself up. While Barry was busy with that, Stu had decided that he wasn't feeling that sick after all, and had rolled into the office around 9:00. Which meant that just as Barry was about to push the button to run the release pipeline, an \"URGENT\" email came in from Stu. \"Hey, everybody, I fixed that bug. Can we get this released ASAP?\" Barry went ahead and released the version that he'd already tested, but out of morbid curiosity, went and checked Stu's fix. if (IsProduct1(_productId)) _programId = 1; else if (IsProduct2(_productId)) _programId = 2; else if (IsProduct3(_productId)) { _programId = 3; } if (IsProduct3(_productId)) { DoSomethingProductId3Specific1(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific2(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific3(); } At least this version would have worked, though I'm not sure Stu fully understands what \"{}\"s mean in C#. Or in most programming languages, if we're being honest. With Barry's work, the launch went off just a few minutes later than the scheduled time. Since the launch was successful, at the next company \"all hands\", the leadership team made sure to congratulate the people instrumental in making it happen: that is to say, the lead developer of the project, Stu.
