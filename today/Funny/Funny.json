    "description": "One driver was faced with an uncooperative car rental company, but they didn't let it get them down. Instead, they took initiative! That new rental car feeling is such a rush. You've got this fresh, clean, probably pretty new car, and it's all yours for the next few days or weeks. You get that fun feeling of driving a new car, and there's no need to worry about your messy passenger seat or those random bags you've left lying around the car. Still, after a while, you just start to want your old car back. For this person, getting their car returned wasn't so easy, and they decided to make the car rental employees pay for what they did in one of the pettiest possible ways. Still, even though this driver took the petty route, they still didn't want to make too big of a mess for the unfortunate minimum-wage workers who were going to be stuck cleaning the car. This person could've done way worse, by mucking up the inside of the car as well as the exterior, but they went easy on the dealership instead. Read about the full exchange below. Up next, read about the restaurant that got slammed with 1-star reviews after they left diners to wait for hours, then texted them with bad news.",

On the one hand, you're planning to spend time with loved ones, which in and of itself requires figuring out logistics, purchasing gifts, and negotiating difficult personalities. On the other hand, you're looking forward to some much-needed time off work, which in and of itself often means going through performance reviews, attending underwhelming Holiday parties, and of course, receiving or not receiving Christmas bonuses.These folks shared the worst \"bonuses\" they have ever received, if you can even call some of these gifts bonuses at all. Some of these range from cheap gift cards (note to employers: a $5 Starbucks gift card is enough for one cup of coffee) to a pen and planner with the company logo on it.

Are our cats calmly napping by our feet the entire night? Or are our cats causing chaos all night the way that they know they are not allowed to during the day? Either option is pawssible, but really, curious as we have been, we have not had any serious reason to put up cameras and film our cats in the middle of the night. This couple definitely had a reason. When you are spending your nights having a hard time sleeping, and you think that maybe - just maybe - there is a chance that your cat is somehow at fault, then yeah, it's time to set up a camera and see what's up. And what was up here, in this couple's case, was both hilarious and adorable at the same time.",

    "description": "Phil's company hired a contractor. It was the typical overseas arrangement: bundle up a pile of work, send it off to another timezone, receive back terrible code, push back during code review, then the whole thing blows up when the contracting company pushes back about how while the code review is in the contract if you're going to be such sticklers about it, they'll never deliver, and then management steps in and says, \"Just keep the code review to style comments,\" and then it ends up not mattering anyway because the contractor assigned to the contract leaves for another contracting company, and management opts to use the remaining billable hours for a new feature instead of finishing the inflight work, so you inherit a half-finished pile of trash and somehow have to make it work. Like I said, pretty standard stuff. Phil found this construct scattered all over the codebase: if cond1 and cond2: pass elif cond1 or cond2: # do actual work I hesitate to post this, because what we're looking at is just an attempt at doing a xor operation. And it's not wrong- it's an if statement way of writing (not a and b) or (a and not b). And if we're being nit-picky, while Python has a xor operator, it's technically a bitwise xor, so I could see someone not connecting that they could use it in this case- cond1 ^ cond2 would work just fine, so long as both conditions are actual booleans. But Python often uses non-boolean comparisons, like: text = \"\" if text: print(\"This won't print.\") This is playing with truthiness, and the problem here is that you can't use a xor to chain these conditions together. if text ^ otherText: # do stuff That's a runtime error, as the ^ is only defined for integral types. You'd have to write: if bool(text) ^ bool(otherText): # do stuff So, would it have been better to use one of the logical equivalences for xor? Certainly. Would it have been even better to turn that equivalence into a function so you could actually call a xor function? Absolutely. But I also can't complain too much about this one. I hate it, don't get me wrong, but it's not a trainwreck. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.

    "description": "One of the long-tenured developers, Douglas at Patrick's company left, which meant Patrick was called upon to pick up that share of the work. The code left behind by Douglas the departing developer was, well… code. For example, this block of Java: private String[] getDomainId(Collection particularCase) { // Get all domainId Collection ids = new ArrayList(); for (ParticularCaseEntity case : particularCase) { ids.add(case.getDomainId()); } Set domainIdsWithoutRepeat = new HashSet(); domainIdsWithoutRepeat.addAll(ids); Collection domainIds = new ArrayList(); for (String domainId : domainIdsWithoutRepeat) { domainIds.add(domainId); } return domainIds.toArray(new String[0]); } The purpose of this code is to get a set of \"domain IDs\"- a set, specifically, because we want them without duplicates. And this code takes the long way around to do it. First, it returns a String[]- but logically, what it should return is a set. Maybe it's meant to comply with an external interface, but it's a private method- so I actually think this developer just didn't understand collection types at all. And I have more evidence for that, which is the rest of this code. We iterate across our ParticularCaseEntitys, and add each one to an array list. Then we create a hash set, and add all of those to a hash set. Then we create another array list, and add each entry in the set to the array list. Then we convert that array list into an array so we can return it. At most, we really only needed the HashSet. But this gives us a nice tour of all the wrong data structures to use for this problem, which is helpful. Speaking of helpful, it didn't take long for Patrick's employer to realize that having Patrick doing his job, and also picking up the work that Douglas used to do was bad. So they opened a new position, at a higher pay grade, hoping to induce a more senior developer to step in. And wouldn't you know, after 6 months, they found a perfect candidate, who had just finished a short six month stint at one of their competitors: Douglas! .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.
