    "description": "Not every cat is born the same, the same way as people. And being different doesn't make you - or the cat - any less purrfect. Some cats are born blind, and that does not stop them for one second from living their lives to the fullest. Some cats are born deaf, and despite the fact that they can't hear themselves screaming, they will put their whole hearts into it so that you hear them. Some cats are born with four ears, and they will use all four of them to ignore you. And some cats, like the one in this video, are born as little medical mysteries, and they are still purrfect. Now, this kitten really is a puzzle. Because the lump on her head is apparently what ended up keeping her alive for so long, but there is no guarantee that it will continue to do so, and so her owners are faced with an unexpected conundrum, but they love her so much that we trust them, no matter what decision they make.",

Anyway, we have a very exciting piece of news to share with you - we have found the secret to meowternal happiness. The answer is actually much simpler than you might imagine. No, it's not money. No, it's not cars, or a house with a white picket fence, or having the purrfect job. The answer is right in front of you - it's cats!Specifically, the answer is adopting another cat. If you keep adopting cats, you will always be surrounded by love, fuzzy cuddles, and cute creatures that want to spend every waking (and sleeping) meowment with you. That sounds like meowternal happiness to us! If you don't believe us, we've compiled a catnip collection of purrfectly simple memes that support our case for adopting an awwdorable cat child. But shhhhh, don't tell everyone you know - then it won't be an example anymore!",

However, it seems that we're not dealing with semi-intelligent people here.This compilation of misspellings ranges from someone who posted their \"alphet\" from the night before in what was supposed to be a flex to someone who literally thought filet mignon was spelled \"flaming young\" (truly spoken like someone who has never had filet mignon).

    "description": "After saving up for a trip for ages, this family suddenly realized that had a few unwanted guests trying to tag along. No one ever said it'd be easy to plan a family trip! There are so many details that go into bringing a trip to fruition. Step one, though, is usually knowing who is going on your trip. This person, u/Altruistic_North1050, thought they were planning an 8-day trip with their husband and two kids, but then her sister-in-law got involved. It would seem that the husband's side of the family love spending all of their time together. They can't understand why someone would want to take a vacation with just their immediate family! This person was really craving that alone time with their kids and husband, but the husband's family has been unrelenting with the pressure to go. In fact, this person revealed that their husband \"says I've hurt his family's feelings.\" It was pretty tacky for them to assume they were invited alone, and even tackier for them to begin planning a trip in the same exact destination. What a hot mess! You can read all about it below, as well as the reactions from commenters, who gave them some sage advice. Up next, this employee was horrified to discover they'd sent an unpleasant email to their boss by accident.",

There's just stuff about it I can't perceive despite my prodigious attempts and ample time to have done so. They see and delight in these hidden geometries! So it is that Noah often accompanies his father as an Adventure Companion, most recently to the Child's Play Charity dinner and auction.

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/magical-bytes",
    "description": "\"Magic bytes\" are a common part of a file header. The first few bytes of a file can often be used to identify what type of file it is. For example, a bitmap file starts with \"BM\", and a PGM file always starts with \"PN\" where \"N\" is a number between 1 and 6, describing the specific variant in use, and WAV files start with \"RIFF\". Many files have less human-readable magic bytes, like the ones Christer was working with. His team was working on software to manipulate a variety of different CAD file types. One thing this code needed to do is identify when the loaded file was a CAD file, but not the specific UFF file type they were looking for. In this case, they need to check that the file does not start with 0xabb0, 0xabb1, or 0xabb3. It was trivially easy to write up a validation check to ensure that the files had the correct magic bytes. And yet, there is no task so easy that someone can't fall flat on their face while doing it. This is how Christer's co-worker solved this problem: const uint16_t *id = (uint16_t*)data.GetBuffer(); if (*id == 0xabb0 || *id == 0xABB0 || *id == 0xabb1 || *id == 0xABB1 || *id == 0xabb3 || *id == 0xABB3) { return 0; } Here we have a case of someone who isn't clear on the difference between hexadecimal numbers and strings. Now, you (and the compiler) might think that 0xABB0 and 0xabb0 are, quite clearly, the same thing. But you don't understand the power of lowercase numbers. Here we have an entirely new numbering system where 0xABB0 and 0xabb0 are not equal, which also means 0xABB0 - 0xabb0 is non-zero. An entirely new field of mathematics lies before us, with new questions to be asked. If 0xABB0 \u003c 0xABB1, is 0xABB0 \u003c 0xabb1 also true? From this little code sample, we can't make any inferences, but these questions give us a rich field of useless mathematics to write papers about. The biggest question of all, is that we know how to write lowercase numbers for A-F, but how do we write a lowercase 3?
