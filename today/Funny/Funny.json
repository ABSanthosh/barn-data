    "description": "Sometimes at work, you can get tasked with the more tedious jobs that make you question why you're drowning in student loan debt to end up like this. Whether you're sending endless emails all day, reorganizing piles of paper, or making coffee for meetings that you don't even get to attend, it can feel like you were hired more to be your boss's personal assistant than to do the work you were actually trained for.But some days, that's okay. There are moments when we'd all rather get paid to do a mindless task than sit in a high-stakes decision-making meeting, sweating through every word. But when your hard work goes unnoticed or, worse, is taken for granted, that's when tensions can start to rise. It's when your boss's lack of appreciation starts to show that you might just decide to leave them with a little parting gift, like... a perfectly organized mess.",

Dunkin' Donuts is probably the most well-known place for that kind of thing, so why not there? Oh, maybe because since it's so well-known it attracts all kinds of horrible people, like Karens. *Clouds darken, thunder bangs, lightning strikes* Yup, the dreaded Karen might also be lurking in that spot where you were just trying to start your day off right.  This Karen, however, chose the wrong Dunkin' to throw a tantrum in that morning, because she was doing it right in front of a guy who has worked in retail/costumer service for over 20 years. And, oh boy, was he not having it that morning…",

    "description": "Cats live pretty secretive lives on the whole. Whether it is the inner world of an indoor cat, or the wide world that outdoor cats roam, patrol and pawrty in, they have large parts of their lives that we rarely get to see, let alone be a part of.And seeing as feline pawrents and fanatics alike cannot get enough of the sweet and simple things our feline friends do everyday, we figured you would probably leap at the opportunity to delve deeper like a cat who found out their food bowl had a false bottom and that they could actually fit their whole body in the full bowl. So find yourself a cozy space to curl up in like an indoor cat would when entering their rich inner world and prepaw yourself for your fabulous feline funnies.",

And then having a litter of kittens to feed, protect, and keep warm… it just sounds purrfectly impawssible to us. We can barely handle our indoor cats when it rains (one of them is very scared of thunder), so we can't imagine trying to keep them safe if we lived outside. But thankfully, there are good-hearted hoomans out there who are willing to help such kitties in need. One of them is in the video below - a sweet man who helped a momma cat save her eight teeny tiny kittens from a flash flood.After stumbling upon this momma cat hiding in a sewer drain, he could sense her distress as the water levels kept rising. She knew she had no other choice but to trust him, so she started bringing him her kittens. One after the other, until he finally had 8 kittens wrapped up safely to take home. He took momma as well, and now all the kitties are safe, dry, and purrfectly satisfied. Watch the heartwarming video below!",

    "description": "Loading times for web pages is one of the key metrics we like to tune. Users will put up with a lot if they feel like they application is responsive. So when Caivs was handed 20MB of PHP and told, \"one of the key pages takes like 30-45 seconds to load. Figure out why,\" it was at least a clear goal. Combing through that gigantic pile of code to try and understand what was happening was an uphill battle. Eventually, Caivs just decided to check the traffic logs while running the application. That highlighted a huge spike in traffic every time the page loaded, and that helped Caivs narrow down exactly where the problem was. $first_image = ''; foreach($images as $the_image) { $image = $the_image['url']; if(file_exists($config-\u003ebase_url.'/uploads/'.$image)) { if($first_image=='') { $first_image = $image; } $image_dimensions = '\u0026w=648\u0026h=432'; $get_dimensions = getimagesize('http://old.datacenter.ip.address/'.$config-\u003ebase_url.'/uploads/'.$image); if($get_dimensions[0] \u003c $get_dimensions[1]) $image_dimensions = '\u0026h=432'; echo ''.$config-\u003ebase_url.'/timthumb.php?src='.$config-\u003ebase_url.'/uploads/'.$image.'\u0026w=125\u0026h=80\u0026zc=1'), 'javascript:;', array('onclick'=\u003e'$(\\'.image_gallery .feature .image\\').html(\\''.$config-\u003ebase_url.'/timthumb.php?src='.$config-\u003ebase_url.'/uploads/'.$image.$image_dimensions.'\u0026zc=1').'\\');$(\\'.image_gallery .feature .title\\').show();$(\\'.image_gallery .feature .title\\').html(\"'.str_replace('\"', '', $the_image['Image Description']).'\");$(\\'.image_gallery .bar ul li a\\').removeClass(\\'active\\');$(\\'.image_gallery .bar ul li\\').removeClass(\\'active\\');$(this).addClass(\\'active\\');$(this).parents(\\'li\\').addClass(\\'active\\');sidebarHeight();curImg=$(this).attr(\\'id\\');translate()','id'=\u003e$img_num)).''; $img_num++; } } For every image they want to display in a gallery, they echo out a list item for it, which that part makes sense- more or less. The mix of PHP, JavaScript, JQuery, and HTML tags is ugly and awful and I hate it. But that's just a prosaic kind of awful, background radiation of looking at PHP code. Yes, it should be launched into the Kupier belt (it doesn't deserve the higher delta-V required to launch it into the sun), but that's not why we're here. The cause of the long load times was in the lines above- where for each image, we getimagesize- a function which downloads the image and checks its stats, all so we can set $image_dimensions. Which, presumably, the server hosting the images uses the query string to resize the returned image. All this is to check- if the height is greater than the width we force the height to be 432 pixels, otherwise we force the whole image to be 648x432 pixels. Now, the server supplying those images had absolutely no caching, so that meant for every image request it needed to resize the image before sending. And for reasons which were unclear, if the requested aspect ratio were wildly different than the actual aspect ratio, it would also sometimes just refused to resize and return a gigantic original image file. But someone also had thought about the perils of badly behaved clients downloading too many images, so if a single host were requesting too many images, it would start throttling the responses. When you add all this up, it meant that this PHP web application was getting throttled by its own file server, because it was requesting too many images, too quickly. Any reasonable user load hitting it would be viewed as an attempted denial of service attack on the file hosting backend. Caivs was able to simply remove the check on filesize, and add a few CSS rules which ensured that files in the gallery wouldn't misbehave terribly. The performance problems went away- at least for that page of the application. Buried in that 20MB of PHP/HTML code, there were plenty more places where things could go wrong.

    "description": "Alice picked up a ticket about a broken date calculation in a React application, and dropped into the code to take a look. There, she found this: export function calcYears(date) { return date \u0026\u0026 Math.floor((new Date() - new Date(date).getTime()) / 3.15576e10) } She stared at it for awhile, trying to understand what the hell this was doing, and why it was dividing by three billion. Also, why there was a \u0026\u0026 in there. But after staring at it for a few minutes, the sick logic of the code makes sense. getTime returns a timestamp in milliseconds. 3.15576e10 is the number of milliseconds in a year. So the Math.floor() expression just gets the difference between two dates as a number of years. The \u0026\u0026 is just a coalescing operator- the last truthy value gets returned, so if for some reason we can't calculate the number of years (because of bad input, perhaps?), we just return the original input date, because that's a brillant way to handle errors. As bizarre as this code is, this isn't the code that was causing problems. It works just fine. So why did Alice get a ticket? She spent some more time puzzling over that, while reading through the code, only to discover that this calcYears function was used almost everywhere in the code- but in one spot, someone decided to write their own. if (birthday) { let year = birthday?.split('-', 1) if (year[0] != '') { let years = new Date().getFullYear() - year[0] return years } } So, this function also works, and is maybe a bit more clear about what it's doing than the calcYears. But note the use of split- this assumes a lot about the input format of the date, and that assumption isn't always reliable. While calcYears still does unexpected things if you fail to give it good input, its accepted range of inputs is broader. Here, if we're not in a date format which starts with \"YYYY-\", this blows up. After spending hours puzzling over this, Alice writes: I HATE HOW NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO CODE [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod. Restrict NuGet feed privileges with ProGet. Learn more.",
