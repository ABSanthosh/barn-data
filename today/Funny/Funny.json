    "description": "Before payday, you're scrambling to pinch pennies. Maybe skipping a meal here and there, definitely avoiding any social plans, and patiently waiting for that direct deposit to hit. And then—boom—you're rich! At least, for like 36 hours. Until the auto-withdrawals start. Rent, utilities, car payments, student loans... it's all too much. And of course, as soon as you get paid, you convince yourself it's time to live a little. Your account is full, why not eat out four times this week? Why not splurge on snacks and that one random thing in your Amazon cart? But a few weeks later, you're filled with regret, staring at your empty account and really wishing you'd rationed just a bit more. Will we ever learn? Probably not. But I guess if we're going to live in this never-ending paycheck cycle, we might as well laugh about it. Keep scrolling for some painfully relatable paycheck memes.",

    "description": "No one likes that person who hogs things. Whether it's someone who is hogging all the parking spaces or all the desserts at a family gathering or a stranger who is taking up way too much space on public transportation, these types of individuals are everywhere. In fact, there is really only one way to stop people like this: You have to call them out on their nonsense. People with this kind of energy end up this way because no one called them out, even back in pre-K when they didn't learn how to share. Letting the behavior slide once, twice, and thrice naturally leads to a kind of entitlement that these folks will never get over now that they have gotten away with self-involved behavior. It seems too simplistic to say, but that direct line from entitled kid to entitled adult is real. So, if you see some kid hogging space now, kindly give them a lesson they won't forget. Otherwise, they'll end up like this guy's neighbor!",

Whether it's the majestic fluffball living with you (or, let's be honest, the one you pay rent to) or a sassy stray you spotted crossing the street, cats are universal emotional support creatures. Yes, all of them. All the time. Even when a stray ignores me like I'm invisible, the snub feels oddly validating and injects a little serotonin into my day.  That being said, my cat, whom I physically gave birth to and have definitely shared more meaningful moments with than most humans, is mine. That's not negotiable. Now, imagine someone walking up to your door, skipping the small talk, and asking for your cat on the grounds that their kid needs it more than you do. That's exactly what this neighbor did.",

    "description": "When faced with an information system lacking sufficient richness to permit its users to express all of the necessary data states, human beings will innovate. In other words, they will find creative ways to bend the system to their will, usually (but not always) inconsequentially. In the early days of information systems, even before electronic computers, we found users choosing to insert various out-of-bounds values into data fields to represent states such as \"I don't know the true value for this item\" or \"It is impossible accurately state the true value of this item because of faulty constraint being applied to the input mechanism\" or other such notions. This practice carried on into the computing age, so that now, numeric fields will often contain values of 9999 or 99999999. Taxpayer numbers will be listed as 000-00-0000 or any other repetition of the same digit or simple sequences. Requirements to enter names collected John Does. Now we also see a fair share of Disney characters. Programmers then try to make their systems idiot-proof, with the obvious and entirely predictable results.The mere fact that these inventions exist at all is entirely due to the ommission of mechanisms for the metacommentary that we all know perfectly well is sometimes necessary. But rather than provide those, it's easier to wave our hands and pretend that these unwanted states won't exist, can be ignored, can be glossed over. \"Relax\" they'll tell you. \"It probably won't ever happen.\" \"If it does happen, it won't matter.\" \"Don't lose your head over it.\" The Beast in Black certainly isn't inclined to cover up an errant sentinel. \"For that price, it had better be a genuine Louis XVI pillow from 21-January-1793.\" A La Lanterne!   Daniel D. doubled up on Error'ds for us. \"Do you need the error details? Yes, please.\"   And again with an alert notification oopsie. \"Google Analytics 4 never stops surprising us any given day with how bugged it is. I call it an \"Exclamation point undefined\". You want more info? Just Google it... Oh wait.\" I do appreciate knowing who is responsible for the various bodges we are sent. Thank you, Daniel.   \"Dark pattern or dumb pattern?\" wonders an anonymous reader. I don't think it's very dark.   Finally, Ian Campbell found a data error that doesn't look like an intentional sentinel. But I'm not sure what this number represents. It is not an integral power of 2. Says Ian, \"SendGrid has a pretty good free plan now with a daily limit of nine quadrillion seven trillion one hundred ninety-nine billion two hundred fifty-four million seven hundred forty thousand nine hundred ninety-two.\"   [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.

    "description": "You know what definitely never changes? Shipping prices. Famously static, despite all economic conditions and the same across all shipping providers. It doesn't matter where you're shipping from, or to, you know exactly what the price will be to ship that package at all times. Wait, what? You don't think that's true? It must be true, because Chris sent us this function, which calculates shipping prices, and it couldn't be wrong, could it? public double getShippingCharge(String shippingType, bool saturday, double subTot) { double shCharge = 0.00; if(shippingType.Equals(\"Ground\")) { if(subTot \u003c= 29.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 0) { shCharge = 4.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 99.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 29.99) { shCharge = 7.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 299.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 99.99) { shCharge = 9.95; } else if(subTot \u003e 299.99) { shCharge = subTot * .05; } } else if(shippingType.Equals(\"Two-Day\")) { if(subTot \u003c= 29.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 0) { shCharge = 14.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 99.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 29.99) { shCharge = 19.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 299.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 99.99) { shCharge = 29.95; } else if(subTot \u003e 299.99) { shCharge = subTot * .10; } } else if(shippingType.Equals(\"Next Day\")) { if(subTot \u003c= 29.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 0) { shCharge = 24.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 99.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 29.99) { shCharge = 34.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 299.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 99.99) { shCharge = 44.95; } else if(subTot \u003e 299.99) { shCharge = subTot * .15; } } else if(shippingType.Equals(\"Next Day a.m.\")) { if(subTot \u003c= 29.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 0) { shCharge = 29.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 99.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 29.99) { shCharge = 39.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 299.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 99.99) { shCharge = 49.95; } else if(subTot \u003e 299.99) { shCharge = subTot * .20; } } return shCharge; } Next you're going to tell me that passing the shipping types around as stringly typed data instead of enums is a mistake, too!
