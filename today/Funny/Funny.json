    "description": "If you knew that your electric breaker was supplying power to another house's appliances and mechanisms, how would you feel? Would you be suspicious that your neighbor knew this was the deal all along, or would you brush it off and try to figure out steps forward so you can avoid this ever happening again? Well, ideally, you'll stop paying for other people's electricity without burning bridges. Sometimes, though, circumstances prevent you from being the bigger person. The homeowner in this next story explains that his neighbor's landlord is making it really hard to recircuit the wiring so everybody's happy.This homeowner realized at some point over a year ago that their electricity was being used by someone other than them. We linked that article right there for you when the narrator references it. Now, nothing has changed, thanks to the same neighbor's landlord. This landlord makes every excuse in the book to ensure this wire rehabilitation does not get done. Why? He claims it's a money issue. Well, it's become a money issue for this homeowner, too, not to mention a major safety hazard due to how the wiring is currently done. Scroll below to read the full story.",

    "description": "Owning in this real estate economy (or this economy in general) is like winning the lottery. Housing prices are up, interest rates have skyrocketed, and it's still worse to be a renter. Last time this happened, it was 2008‚Ä¶ But let's not get ahead of ourselves.Though homeownership is the end goal for most people, it's not as easy as some folks make it seem. You can no longer call your landlord to fix the toilet when it won't flush, and all of the insects and vermin you find in your food pantry will be yours to deal with‚Äîand to pay for. Yikes.Now, I am a renter through and through, likely because I have commitment issues. Also, I don't have enough money. Hey! City prices are outrageous‚Ä¶ However, I also don't see a world where I'd want to be responsible for everything that can go wrong in a home. Many of you folks are likely handy by trade or by free time, and I commend you for that. Folks like me‚Ä¶ We don't know how to do that stuff, and happily.If you're a homeowner down in the dumps currently, here are a few memes to laugh away the pain.",

Do we always have room for one more? Yes. Do we wish the new cat was a teeny tiny maine coon kitten that is more fluff than body? Absolutely yes. But, Blake, you might say, how would you go about getting a brand new kitten on such short notice? Turns out we have a secret technique that works for capturing new feline friends without even needing the CDS's help.It's purrfectly easy and diabolically simple. You only need two ingredients for this plan to work: a box (or some other container that a cat will want to squeeze into) and patience. Patience is the hardest part, honestly. Step one is to set out the container in any place where you know cats roam, and the second is to wait until one hops in! We've gathered some pics below of some silly success stories, they're purrfectly hissterical!Fluff. Chaos. Drama! Our weekly cat newsletter has it all -¬† subscribe here.",

It's absolutely unbelievable. \"There's been a physics breakthrough!\" Mate exclaimed. \"Looking at meteoblue, I should probably reconsider that hike on Monday.\" Yes, you should blow it off, but you won't need to. ¬† An anonymous fryfan frets \"The yellow arches app (at least in the UK) is a buggy mess, and I'm amazed it works at all when it does. Whilst I've heard of null, it would appear that they have another version of null, called ullnullf! Comments sent to their technical team over the years, including those with good reproduceable bugs, tend to go unanswered, unfortunately.\" ¬† Llarry A. whipped out his wallet but baffled \"I tried to pay in cash, but I wasn't sure how much.\" ¬† \"Github goes gonzo!\" groused Gwenn Le Bihan. \"Seems like Github's LLM model broke containment and error'd all over the website layout. crawling out of its grouped button.\" Gross. ¬† Peter G. gripes \"The text in the image really says it all.\" He just needs to rate his experience above 7 in order to enable the submit button. ¬† [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.

Note, this is not to say that they were using SVN, or Mercurial, or even Visual Source Safe. They were not using anything. How do I know? /** * Converts HTML to PDF using HTMLDOC. * * @param printlogEntry ** @param inBytes * html. * @param outPDF * pdf. * @throws IOException * when error. * @throws ParseException */ public void fromHtmlToPdfOld(PrintlogEntry printlogEntry, byte[] inBytes, final OutputStream outPDF) throws IOException, ParseException {...} /** * Converts HTML to PDF using HTMLDOC. * * @param printlogEntry ** @param inBytes * html. * @param outPDF * pdf. * @throws IOException * when error. * @throws ParseException */ public void fromHtmlToPdfNew(PrintlogEntry printlogEntry, byte[] inBytes, final OutputStream outPDF) throws IOException, ParseException {...} Originally, the function was just called fromHtmlToPdf. Instead of updating the implementation, or using it as a wrapper to call the correct implementation, they renamed it to Old, added one named New, then let the compiler tell them where they needed to update the code to use the new implementation. Mads adds: \"And this is just one example in this code. This far, I have found 5 of these.\" .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] ProGet‚Äôs got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds. Learn more.",
