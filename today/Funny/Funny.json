    "description": "Weddings can make everyone's sanity fray at the edges a little bit, but when this woman found herself floundering beneath the pressure of her materialistic alter-ego, everyone involved with the wedding got crushed–including guests, friends, family, and everyone she ever knew on Facebook. It's understandable to feel like you're going a little cuckoo during the wedding planning process. With a million decisions to make, a strict budget to follow, and your 10-year-old Pinterest board judging your every move, it always feels like you're making the wrong call. However, the delicate line between a stressed-out bride and a bridezilla gets crossed when a prospective bride starts lashing out with entitled demands. The woman in this next tale takes the cake on insane requests, insisting that each guest attending her wedding contribute $1500 to fund an exorbitant, out-of-budget, Kardashian-style wedding.",

    "description": "The grass isn't always greener, you know… Though it's nice to be able to afford to buy yourself the best belongings money can buy, it's not always the best long-term decision. Saving money is super hard, in my opinion, because it's boring, and all the fun things one can do with money are happening now. You can save that money and have a larger retirement fund someday, or you could go to a concert with your friends now, plan a lofty vacation now, or buy yourself a shiny new car… now. Saving money for the future is so boring: what if your future self wants current you to have fun with that chunk of change? The fiscally responsible thing to do with your extra cash is to sock it away for the future, but it's not the most satisfying option in the short term. You can show off a new car to your friends, but no one's going to be impressed by your savings for a rainy day. This guy is trying to talk their wife out of buying a new car. They already have three vehicles! Still, this perosn thinks that since they can afford a new SUV, that it's time to take out a new car payment. This dude turned to the internet for advice, and people had some good ideas for them. Up next, read about the big announcement that one couple dropped during their brother's wedding ceremony, revealing that \"I was...taking attention away from my brother.\"",

    "description": "Howdy there, feline fam. One of the things we love doing most as a cat pawrent is taking silly pictures of our cats. We love taking pictures of them when they are in full airplane mode, when they fall asleep in purrfectly silly pawsitions, those ameowzing up-close-and-purrsonal angles, and especially the outrageously silly 0.5x zoom pics. They're already so cute and funny-looking that any pawpportunity we have to make them look even sillier, we take it without hesitation.One genius cat owner took this topic to the next level - by adding a secret camera to their cat's food bowl and to catch their nomming up close. Let us just say…we're really mad we didn't think about this first. These pictures are the literal definition of purrfection. Ladies, gentlemen, and friends of the feline-variety, you are witnessing the birth of a new meme. Take a second to soak it in (and laugh at how hissterical these cat pictures are). Scroll down to enjoy more of this hilarious POV and some of the comedic comments below. Enjoy!",

    "description": "We think that every cat owner has been through this moment. Sure, we know that our cats love us deeply. We know it, we have seen it, we believe it, but… as new cat owners, way back in the day, we did wonder, for a mere few seconds, if cats really love their humans that much. Yup, we fell for the propaganda too. We didn't know better. When our cat bit us for the first time, we thought that was it, the cat hated us. Now, things are different, of course, but we still understand that deep, deep fear. We're not going to lie though. As much as we understand the fear, it was still funny as heck for us to come across this thread. Someone tell this man that cats appreciate us and love us and care for us very, very much. Their ways of showing it might simply be a little funny sometimes, and that is okay, we promise. There is no need for mental breakdowns over the subject. But if you do have any more of them, please post them too.",

    "description": "Today's anonymous submission is a delightfully simple line of JavaScript which really is an archetype of a representative line. $json = \"{\"; Now, I know you're thinking, \"I see a '$' sigil, this must be PHP or maybe Perl!\" No, this is JavaScript. And as you might be gathering from the code, this is the first line in a long block that constructs JSON through string concatenation. And yes, JavaScript has built in functions for this, which work better than this. While it's possible that they need to generate custom JSON to support a misbehaving parser on the other side, that's it's own WTF- and it isn't the case here. The developers responsible simply didn't know how to handle JSON in JavaScript. Do you know what else they couldn't understand? Source control and collaboration tools, so all of the JavaScript files were named things like david.js and lisa.js- each developer got their own JS file to work on, so they didn't conflict with anyone else.

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/mr-number",
    "description": "Ted's company hired a contract team to build an application. The budget eventually ran out without a finished application, so the code the contract team had produced was handed off to Ted's team to finish. This is an example of the Ruby code Ted inherited: def self.is_uniqueness(mr_number) out = false mrn = PatientMrn.find_by_mr_number(mr_number) if mrn out = true return mrn end return nil end The function is called is_uniqueness which is definitely some language barrier naming (is_unique is a more English way of wording it). But if we trace through the logic, this is just a wrapper around PatientMrn.find_by_mr_number- it returns an \"mrn\". So, the first obvious problem: this isn't checking uniqueness in any way, shape or form. Then there's the whole check for a valid record- either we find a record or we return nil. But since find_by_mr_number is clearly returning something falsy, that doesn't seem necessary. And that is the default behavior for the Rails generated find_by methods- they just return nil if there are no records. So none of the checks are needed here. This whole method isn't needed here. Finally, there's out. I have no idea what they were trying to accomplish here, but it smells like they wanted a global variable that they could check after the call for error statuses. If that was their goal, they failed in a few ways- first, returning nil conveys the same information. Second, global variables in Ruby get a $ sigil in front of them. What the out variable truly represents is \"do I want out of this codebase?\" True. That is definitely true.
