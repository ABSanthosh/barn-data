    "description": "This husband wasn't prepared for the response he got from his wife! After 21 years of marriage and raising 6 children together, this couple's relationship is crumbling. After spending nearly half of their lives together, this relationship is coming to a close, and it's getting messy! This husband sounds like a complete tool, treating his wife badly throughout their marriage (including while his wife gave birth to those 6 kids). His wife found out that he's still been pining for his ex. They broke up when they were in their 20s, but this 50-year-old man is still wishing he was with his ex instead of his long-term wife. It's pretty pathetic, and his wife has let him know in no uncertain terms that he isn't exactly desirable… Especially since he not only has no job, but keeps rejecting his wife's helpful attempts to earn some cash. The husband is definitely one of those people who can dish out insults, but can't take the slightest bit of criticism. For her sake, let's hope this woman dumps this guy to the curb. After all, if he wants his ex so badly, he should attempt to do it, and see how that works out. Next, have a giggle at some of the most cringe-worthy college admissions essays that kids have ever written, like one person who ended every single sentence with multiple exclamation points.",

    "description": "What kind of stepmother holds a grudge against someone because of a choice they made when they were 11? Well, the short answer to that question is this Redditor's stepmom, but the longer answer is someone so self-absorbed and out-of-touch that they have no ability to step outside of their own experience,This Redditor was dealing with the sudden loss of her biological mother right before her father's second wedding. Obviously, that is a lot of emotional turbulence for a pre-teen to endure, but apparently, none of the adults involved were able to comprehend that, especially the kid's dad and future stepmom. What makes this story even more frustrating is that the stepmom never forgave the Redditor and never let her live it down. In fact, she seemed to make up all sorts of lost opportunities that were \"supposed to happen\" at the wedding if she were present, like a stepsister dance. Essentially, this grown adult was turning her daughter on her stepkid and completely ignoring the state of grief the Redditor was in at the time.Keep scrolling below to see how the Redditor finally confronted her dad and stepmom over all this nonsense. For more stories like this, take a look at this post about a family disagreement on a plane.",

And that is that in some part of your heart, if not all of it, you love Santa. He represents so much good, in a world filled with so much bad, that this figure is engrained in many of our memories as a sign that if even only for a moment, everything will be ok.A great example of this being that every Home Alone movie ended at Christmas when the family came home and Kevin McCallister was found to be right as rain by his family. Even if they were going to do the same thing the following year. So we figured that we might pump up the feels by incorporating cute cats into this list of heartwarming cat memes to nourish your Santa-loving soul.",

If Marvels was a bit more constrained, or if R6 were a little less… whatever it is, maybe they would start bleeding into each other. In a round of Rainbow, for example, we probably won't be erased from reality by Scarlet Witch's \"Reality Erasure\" ult. You know? It helps you compartmentalize.

    "description": "Conditional statements, we would hope, are one of the most basic and well understood constructs in any programming language. Hope, of course, is for fools and suckers, so let's take a look at a few short snippets. Our first installment comes from Jonas. if (!checkAndDelete(Definitions.DirectoryName, currentTime)); //Empty statement I appreciate the comment, which informs us that this empty statement is intentional. Why it's intentional remains mysterious. Jonas found this while going through linter warnings. After fixing this, there are only 25,000 more warnings to go. Brodey has a similar construct, but from a very different language. If (Session.Item(Session.SessionID \u0026 \"Origional\") IsNot Nothing) Then End If I have to give bonus points for the origional spelling of \"original\". But spelling aside, there's a hint of something sinister here- we're concatenating strings with the SessionId- I don't know what is going wrong here, but it's definitely something. Our last little snippet comes from Midiane. While not a conditional, it shows a misunderstanding of either booleans or comments. $mail-\u003eSMTPAuth = false; // turn on SMTP authentication The comment clearly is out of date with the code (which is the main reason we shouldn't repeat what is in the code as a comment). At least, we hope the comment is just out of date. A worse scenario is that setting the flag equal to false enables it. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time.

This array is going to be our lookup table for month names, so I almost forgive making it one-indexed- January is month 1, normally. Almost. Because not only is that stupid, the getMonth() function on a date returns the month as a zero-indexed number. January is month 0. So they need to add one to the result of getMonth for their lookup table to work, and it's just so dumb. Then of course, be output this all using document.write, so we just know it's terrible JavaScript, all the way around.
