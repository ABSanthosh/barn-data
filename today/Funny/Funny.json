    "description": "Ahhh, the Fourth of July!What a weekend full of fun, food, and festive celebrations! There are countless reasons why the Fourth of July is every American's favorite weekend of the year… and here are four big reasons:1.) The mouth-watering feasts!Hotdogs, hamburgers, potato salad… the list goes on. It's the one weekend a year (alongside Thanksgiving, of course) where all dietary restrictions seem to fly out the window…and we're not mad about it!2.) Quality time with family and friendsIt's a time when our nearest and dearest come from near and far to celebrate our nation's independence together. There are few things beat sharing this time together and making memories with our loved ones.3.) Flag displays and the 'perfect' American decorWe wear our pride on our sleeves, and hang it on our walls! Red, white, and blue become the ultimate color combination, and suddenly every corner is filled with American flags…making us wonder if this could be a look for all year round. 4.) And last but not least: the fireworks!Vibrant, colorful displays that light up the sky and remind us how lucky we are to call America home.But… as much as this weekend is all about fun and celebration, it's easy to forget about our neighbors. So where do we draw the line between a wild, joy-filled weekend of noise, fireworks, and partying and showing respect for the people around us?",

    "description": "Every family has its feuds. And when you throw in-laws in the mix, tensions often rise even higher. Famously, people either love their in-laws or avoid them like the plague. Some people seamlessly fit in with their partner's family and have few issues, while others experience personality clashes and conflict, especially when boundaries are crossed. For the family in this story, we have an instance where a woman craves a close relationship with her mother-in-law but does so in an uncomfortable, somewhat invasive way. When the mother-in-law has had enough and lays down the law, she's met with backlash from the family. She realizes that this conflict is also straining her relationship with her son. The story sparked quite a debate in the Reddit comments about family boundaries and who was in the wrong. It's normal to want a good relationship with your in-laws, but sometimes people just don't mix well together.",

    "description": "Remember when you were a kid and thought people in their 30s had it all figured out? Like, full-on mortgage-holding, salad-prepping, matching-socks-wearing grownups? Yeah… about that. Turns out, being in your 30s mostly means wondering where your energy went, drinking coffee like it's juice, and realizing you've somehow accumulated a suspicious number of cats. But honestly? That's not a bad trade-off.Because while the \"figured out\" part is still pending, you have figured out one important thing: cats make everything better. They're soft, chaotic, emotionally confusing little goblins, and they give the kind of comfort that no balanced checkbook ever could. Sure, you didn't become a millionaire or write a novel (yet), but you did become a proud cat hoarder, and that's its own kind of success.So here's to all the 30-somethings still winging it, with cat fur on their clothes and memes in their hearts. This collection of feline funnies is for you - because if life's going to be a little weird and unpredictable, at least it's better with cats.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver.

    "description": "This cat lover might've stepped on a few tails. After noticing a frail, vision-impaired kitty constantly hanging around her yard, she assumed the sweet old fluff was a stray. Turns out, the cat belonged to her neighbor, who owns a whopping nine free-roaming felines. Concerned for the senior cat's health, this kind-hearted pawrent offered food, pets, and even shelter during a thunderstorm, letting her rest in the catio with the door open for a stress-free escape.When the neighbor came knocking (loudly) the next morning, fur flew. Despite the cat heading home on her own hours earlier, the neighbor accused her of stealing her cat, hurled insults, and warned her never to interact with her cats again. To make things messier, she then spread rumors around the neighborhood, painting this rescuer as a catnapper.Now, the pawrent feels bad for bonding with the blind kitty, but when a vulnerable cat chooses you for comfort and care, how can you not lend a paw? Maybe it ruffled some feathers, but kindness shouldn't come with claws attached.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

They were not gentle, but they weren't overtly hostile: how have you used AI this week to accomplish your tasks? If you squint a little, you can see kind of a weird visage in the negative space. The newer ones I've seen are a little more like placing a loaded gun on the table before you speak. Why haven't you?

Fortunately for him, the vendor documentation told him that there was a method called obtainRowLock. obtainRowLock($table, $where) - Attempt to lock a row, will escalate and lock the table if row locking is not supported, will escalate and lock the database if table locking is not supported; returns true on success, false on failure $table - name of table to lock $where - WHERE clause to define rows, ex: \"WHERE id=52\". If left empty, function will assume a table lock That was exactly what Dan needed, so he called it. It returned false, implying a failure. He changed the parameters. He discarded his where clause. He tried all sorts of things, and it always returned false. So he dug into the source code, to see how it actually worked. function obtainRowLock($table, $where) { return false; } Is it truly a failure if you don't even try?
