She wanted him to risk his career for the sake of her weekday wedding, all because she had forgotten what it's like to be employed, ask for PTO, and get denied‚Ä¶",

Do we always have room for one more? Yes. Do we wish the new cat was a teeny tiny maine coon kitten that is more fluff than body? Absolutely yes. But, Blake, you might say, how would you go about getting a brand new kitten on such short notice? Turns out we have a secret technique that works for capturing new feline friends without even needing the CDS's help.It's purrfectly easy and diabolically simple. You only need two ingredients for this plan to work: a box (or some other container that a cat will want to squeeze into) and patience. Patience is the hardest part, honestly. Step one is to set out the container in any place where you know cats roam, and the second is to wait until one hops in! We've gathered some pics below of some silly success stories, they're purrfectly hissterical!Fluff. Chaos. Drama! Our weekly cat newsletter has it all -¬† subscribe here.",
