We simply love Halloween - it's the one time of year we don't feel badly about dressing up our cute cats in costumes. Of course we don't make them wear it for long if they don't want to, but it turns out that our void cat actually loves their costumes! From dressing up as a very thirsty Dracula to Toothless, they would stay in their costumes all year if they could!Turns out our spooktacular void isn't the only one, as we found a whole litter box of other beautiful black fur babies that simply love getting into the spooky spirit. Don't worry, none of these black cats are bringing any sort of bad luck - all they bring with them is a pawdorable amount of cuteness overload. Bust out your best costume and get ready to fill your cuteness meter all the way up to the tippy top!",

    "description": "Cats are some of the most extreme creatures on this planet. They have absolutely no normal, no middle ground, no sense of homogeneity. They live on the edges of everything and love nothing more than pushing things off the edge just to make the edge even more extreme than it was before. So it should come as no surprise that when they want to, they can be some of the most intimate and marvelous souls to have in your home. So we made this list of intimate meowments from the humble lives of house cats to help you feel like you are working from home today, because at least that way your boss's berating calls can be declined.From the cute cat couple who are so loving and supportive of one and other, to the tactless cat who simply cannot figure out how to show his love and affection for his favorite feline without putting them off, to the sweet kitten getting its teeth brushed.",

Anyone from that era would've told you: \"Harry Potter is Daniel Radcliffe.\" Image via @gayrauderIn the original film series, the young wizard Harry Potter is played by Daniel Radcliffe. His school friends were Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. Radcliffe and Grint were 11 years old when they were cast, while Watson was 10 years old. The director of the first two movies wrote that during casting, they got \"thousands and thousands of videotapes of kids from all over the country.\" However, they were smitten with these child actors in particular and went to great lengths to provide them with a positive work environment and to carefully cultivate their identities in the media as they grew up.  Image via @FilmUpdates",

    "description": "This wasn't exactly neighborly behavior on both sides of the situation. However, the Redditor ended up doing what he had to in order to make the message to his entitled next-door neighbor clear.That resident allowed their dog to go to the bathroom on the Redditor's lawn every day. The first time, of course, the Redditor excused it. The second time, he thought about bringing it up. By the fifth time, he needed to communicate to the dude next door that this was beyond forgiveness. The best way to get even is to be petty right back. This is not a \"when they go low, we go high\" situation. This is very much a \"when they go low, we meet them at their level and plunge them even further below\" situation. The Redditor decided that the best course of action was to return the remains on top of the neighbor's garbage can without properly packaging the trash so that they would receive a fine from the HOA.Keep scrolling below for the full play-by-play.

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/what-the-hmm",
    "description": "Our stories come from you, our readers- which, it's worth reminding everyone, keep those submissions coming in. There's nothing on this site without your submissions. Now, we do get some submissions which don't make the page. Frequently, it's simply because we simply don't have enough context from the submission to understand it or comment on it effectively. Often, it's just not that remarkable. And sometimes, it's because the code isn't a WTF at all. So I want to discuss some of these, because I think it's still interesting. And it's unfair to expect everyone to know everything, so for the submitters who discover they didn't understand why this code isn't bad, you're one of today's lucky 10,000. We start with this snippet, from Guss: #define FEATURE_SENSE_CHAN (1 \u003c\u003c 0) #define FEATURE_SENSE_PEER (1 \u003c\u003c 1) Guss writes: The Asterisk open source telephony engine has some features that need to know from which direction they've been invoked in a two-way call. This is called \"sense\" in the Asterisk lingo, and there are two macros defined in the source which allow you to textually know if you're talking about this direction or the other. This of course stands for 1 and 0 respectively, but they couldn't have just simply go on and say that - it has to be \"interesting\". Do also note, as this is a macro, it means that whenever someone sets or tests the \"sense\", another redundant bit shift operation is done. First, minor detail- this stands for 1 and 2 respectively. And what's important here is that these fields are clearly meant to be a bitmask. And when we're talking about a bitmask, using bitshift operators makes the code more clear. And we can generally rely on a shift by zero bits to be a no-op, and any compiler should be smart enough to spot that and optimize the operation out. Hell, a quick check with GCC shows that even the (1 \u003c\u003c 1) gets optimized to just the constant 0x2. Not a WTF, but it does highlight something we've commented on in the past- bitmasks can be confusing for people. This is a good example of that. But not only is this not a WTF, but it's not even bad code. (Now, it may be the case that these are never really used as a bitmask, in which case, that's a mild WTF, but that's not what Guss was drawing our attention to) In other cases, the code is bad, but it may be reacting to the badness it's surrounded by. Greg inherited this blob from some offshore contractors: RegistryKey RK = Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey(\"SOFTWARE\\\\XXXXX\\\\YYYYY\"); string BoolLog = \"\"; if (RK != null) BoolLog = ((string)RK.GetValue(\"LogSocket\", \"\")).ToLower(); if (BoolLog == \"true\" || BoolLog == \"yes\" || BoolLog == \"1\") { ... } Now, seeing a string variable called BoolLog is a big red flag about bad code inbound. And we see handling some stringly typed boolean data to try and get a truth value. Which all whiffs of bad code. But let's talk about the Windows Registry. It's typed, but the types are strings, lists of strings, and various numeric types. There's no strictly boolean type. And sure, while explicitly storing a 1 in a numeric field is probably a better choice for the registry than string booleans, there are reasons why you might do that (especially if you frequently need to modify Registry keys by hand, like when you're debugging). The real WTF, in this case, isn't this code, but is instead the Windows Registry. Having a single tree store be the repository for all your system configuration sounds like a good idea on paper, but as anyone who's worked with it has discovered- it's a nightmare. The code here isn't terrible. It's not good, but it's a natural reaction to the terrible world in which it lives. Sometimes, the code is actually downright awful, but it's just hard to care about too much. Rudolf was shopping for bulk LEDs, which inevitably leads one to all sorts of websites based in China offering incredibly cheap prices and questionable quality control. The site Rudolf was looking at had all sorts of rendering glitches, and so out of curiosity, he viewed the source. {\\rtf1\\ansi\\ansicpg1252\\deff0\\deflang2055{\\fonttbl{\\f0\\froman\\fcharset0 Times New Roman;}{\\f1\\fswiss\\fcharset0 Arial;}} {\\*\\generator Msftedit 5.41.21.2509;}\\viewkind4\\uc1\\pard\\f0\\fs24 \u003chtml\u003e\\par \\par \u003chead\u003e \u003cmeta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"1; url=http://totally-fine-leds-really-its-fine.ch\"\u003e \\par Here we see someone wrote their HTML in WordPad, and saved the file as an RTF, instead of a plain text file. Which sure, is bad. But again, we need to put this in context: this almost certainly isn't the page for handling any transactions or sales (that almost certainly uses a prebaked ecommerce plugin). This is their approach to letting \"regular\" users upload content to the site- frequently documentation pages. This isn't a case where some developer should have known better messed up- this is almost certainly some sales person who has an HTML template to fill in and upload. It probably stretches their technical skills to the limit to \"Save As…\" in WordPad. So the code isn't bad. Again, the environment in which it sits is bad. But this is a case where the environment doesn't matter- these kinds of sites are really hoping to score some B2B sales in bulk quantities, and \"customer service\" and \"useful website\" isn't going to drive sales better than \"bargain basement prices\" will. They're not trying to sell to consumers, they're trying to sell to a company which will put these into consumer products. Honestly, we should be grateful that they at least tried to make an HTML file, and didn't just upload PDFs, which is usually what you find on these sites. Sometimes, we don't have a WTF. Sometimes, we have a broken world that we can just do our best to navigate. We must simply do our best. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time.

    "description": "When SC got hired, the manager said \"unit testing is very important to us, and we have 100% test coverage.\" Well, that didn't sound terrible, and SC was excited to see what kind of practices they used to keep them at that high coverage. [Test] public void a_definition() { Assert.True(new TypeExpectations() .DerivesFrom\u003cobject\u003e() .IsConcreteClass() .IsSealed() .HasDefaultConstructor() .IsNotDecorated() .Implements() .Result); } This is an example of what all of their tests look like. There are almost no tests of functionality, and instead just long piles of these kinds of type assertions. Which, having type assertions isn't a bad idea, most of these would be caught by the compiler: DerviesFrom is a tautology (perhaps this test framework is ensuring it doesn't derive from other classes? but object is the parent of all classes) IsConcreteClass would be caught at compile time anywhere someone created an instance HasDefaultConstructor would again, be caught if it were used Implement would also be caught anywhere you actually tried to use polymorphism. IsSealed and IsNotDecorated will actually do something, I suppose, though I wonder how much I actually care about that something. It's not wrong to check, but in the absence of actual real unit tests, why do I care? Because every class had a test like this, and because of the way the test framework worked, when they ran code coverage metrics, they got a 100% score. It wasn't testing any of the code, mind you, but hey, the tests touched all of it. [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.
