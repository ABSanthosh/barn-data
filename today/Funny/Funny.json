    "description": "You can go to a restaurant with the best food in the world, but if the service is bad, the entire experience is ruined. On the flip side, great service can (sort of) make up for less-than-stellar food. A server's attitude and effort usually depend on management and how they're treated as employees. Whether you're a server or not, you know that if you're not being treated fairly by your boss, you're not about to go above and beyond when on the clock.That's exactly what happened when this restaurant got a new manager. The changes started small but quickly spiraled—added workloads, stricter rules, and management's complete disregard for employee well-being. One longtime server had been there for years, but after watching the restaurant go downhill, they gave their notice. But before leaving, they warned management: \"You're going to lose all your best people.\" Andddd, they were right. Keep reading to find out what happened next.",

Of course, this was a problem you thought had been resolved, only to learn that you're in more debt than you ever had been before. How would you proceed in this situation? You can't possibly open a bank account together while you're in this much debt. Then, you would have to assume his problem. You can't possibly pay for the expensive wedding you had planned when there are more imminent financial concerns. You have to put any other expensive future plans on hold as well, such as having children or purchasing a home.This is not just a hypothetical scenario. This actually happened to a bride-to-be. Here's what she had to say about her relationship drama!",

Sunday is not for dramatic threads and gut-wrenching stories. No, Sunday is all about pawsitivity and wholesome cat memes. What we want to spend all day doing is relaxing and enjoying cats - whether it's cuddling with our real cat and awwing and heartwarming cat memes.Really, let's be honest, starting any day with pawsitive cat memes would be good for our soul. It would help us start our days on the right paw with the right cattitude. But on Sunday, it's extra impawtant. Because that way, we could be collecting all the good vibes that we need for next week. And boy, do we need some good vibes. With all the craziness going on in the world, the more wholesomeness we get into our system, the better, and everyone knows that there is nothing more heartwarming and pure than a bunch of cats being their itty bitty cute selves.",

    "description": "Let us tell you a little story about our childhood, feline fam. Our mom was the \"animal person,\" and our dad had never had a pet before in his life. Upon getting married, our mom promptly went out and adopted doggo after doggo. Our dad tolerated it, but he always stood firm and said, \"No cats, I don't like cats.\" What did our mom do? She went out and adopted a shelter cat (she absolutely could not turn a blind eye to any animal in need). Needless to say, our father was not pleased.The cat and our dad had a staring contest that lasted about two days, and then they were inseparable. The cat followed our dad around like a shadow and basically forced him to love his new kitty companion. When he would cook, the cat would meow insufferably until our dad would pick him up and hold him so he could be a part of the activity (and hopefully convince our dad to give him a little taste). He never stood a chance. Below are some purrfectly excellent examples of cat dads who never stood a chance - they're wholesomely sweet and purrfectly awwdorable!",

I think there's too much texture, too much detail for a single person and I am prepared to sign up for either side of the dyad. It's also updated the genre itself - something like an immersive sim, immy simmy perhaps, with some creature comforts for players that jettison some of the drudgery we associate with this sort of game.",

    "description": "I'm a JSON curmudgeon, in that I think that its type-system, inherited from JavaScript, is bad. It's a limited vocabulary of types, and it forces developers to play odd games of convention. For example, because it lacks any sort of date type, you either have to explode your date out as a sub-dictionary (arguably, the \"right\" approach) or do what most people do- use an ISO formatted string as your date. The latter version requires you to attempt to parse the sting to validate the data, but validating JSON is a whole thing anyway. But, enough about me being old and cranky. Do you know one type JSON supports? Boolean values. Which is why this specification from today's anonymous submitter annoys me so much: field: sw_auto_update type: string valid values: /(on)|(off)/ field: data_auto_update type: string valid values: /(on)|(off)/ field: spanning_tree_protocol type: string valid values: /(on)|(off)/ Their custom validator absolutely requires the use of strings, and absolutely requires that they have these values. Sending a boolean, or worse, the string \"true\" causes the request to get rejected. Our submitter doesn't explain why it's this way, but I have a strong suspicion that it's because it was originally designed to support a form submission with radio buttons. The form is long gone, but the API contract remains. [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod. Restrict NuGet feed privileges with ProGet. Learn more.",
