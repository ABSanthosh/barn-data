Some managers, superiors, and executives have next to zero understanding of boundaries and can make our own little North Pole factories feel more stressful than being on Fear Factor.The team lead at the center of this particular story is without a doubt one clear case of an honorary inductee on Santa's naughty list, mixing misuse of authority with disrespect for employees' personal time.One of Santa's Little Helpers shared this tricky situation she faced at work on Reddit, and it's a classic case of how managers can sometimes get a little confused and get work events and social gatherings mixed up.The original poster (OP) skipped an optional Christmas party at her job, only to be told by her team lead not to come back to work without a doctor's note. OP was genuinely sick that day, but she hadn't even signed up for the party in the first place so understandably, she was pretty confused by the whole thing, especially since it wasn't a required work event.",

    "description": "Jeff really should have resigned in the New Year. That way, none of these shenanigans would have gone down at the office Christmas party.Here, we have a former manager who recently resigned the week before the office Christmas party and asked if he could attend the event with his wife anyway. Presumably, he viewed this party as a final goodbye. Naturally, the coworker (who also happened to be hosting the event at his house) felt too cornered in the moment to say no.Thankfully, the coworker followed up after the event to report that things, in fact, were as awkward as he had anticipated. Let's just say that Jeff's wife unexpectedly was the culprit of the most egregious and climactic moment of the evening. Keep scrolling below for the original post and for the coworker's update after the Christmas party. For more stories like this, check out this post about a Karen's HOA conundrum.",

    "description": "Hello, cat pawrents and fluffy feline fans, did you know that cats are the most adorable creatures there are? Of course you knew that, but we felt an urge to say that once again - because it's never enough. And here we'll say it again - cats are the most adorable creatures there are. Not just from every creature that exists on Earth, but from every creature that has ever existed on Earth. And not just on Earth, cats are the most adorable creatures to have ever existed in… existence! Since the beginning of time, there has not existed a more adorable creature than a cat.Because cats are so adorable, it's no wonder that all of us cat pawrents refer to them as our babies. Cats are our babies, and nothing can change that. They don't need to be human babies, and they don't need to be babies at all - but cats are totally babies, and nothing can change that fact.",

Enter the maid of honor from stage left, she has a mild cat allergy and requests to stay with the bride for a couple of months. She asks the bride if she can have a friend watch Paulie while she stays with her, but the bride rightfully refuses because it's her cat and the MOH is a guest in her home. But then, two weeks before MOH moves in, Paulie suddenly and mysteriously goes missing.MOH helps our protective cat mom put up posters for her missing cat, even going to nearby shelters to help find the poor, lost baby. Fast forward four months, and the cat mom finds out that her MOH secretly kidnapped and rehomed Paulie before she moved in. The bride kicked out and fired her MOH, then blocked her. The level of audacity in this post is too heckin' high! You have to read it to believe it, so scroll down to enjoy all of this juicy, feline-focused, wedding cat-astrophe story below. It's one for the record books.",

    "description": "Rachel worked on a system which collected data about children, provided by parents and medical professionals. There was one bug that drew a lot of fire: no one could report the age of a child as less than one. That was a problem, as for most of their users, child ages are zero-indexed. One of the devs picked up the bug, made a change, and went on to the next bug. This was the fix: if (!empty($_POST[\"age_at_time\"]) || empty($_POST[\"age_at_time\"])) The original check had been !empty- which may seem like it's ensuring a value was provided, but in PHP the empty function returns true for null values, empty strings, and anything falsey- like the integer 0. So they made a change to cover the other case, and never stopped to ask themselves, \"Would doing this be stupid?\" [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
