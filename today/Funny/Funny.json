    "description": "When it comes to working at a place with long periods of down time and free wifi, it's difficult to stay off the socials. It's pretty standard knowledge to not do anything personal on the company's wifi, especially not on a company laptop or computer, because they can use that against you. If you have a manager or boss who is already out to get you, then you should really avoid being online when you are not supposed to be. Listen, we know it's hard. When you have a job where you find yourself just sitting there twiddling your thumbs until a customer shows up—of course you want to do something like check your IG feed or scroll throw funny videos on the Tok. But try your best to resist.  In the case of this Redditor, it was Reddit itself that was one of his downfalls. That and using the company wifi to look for a new job… LOL Amateur hour, my guy. However, it was a Reddit post that he created that his boss cited when he was telling him why he was being let go \"effective immediately.\" The thing is, he definitely wasn't the only employee going online on the company's dime…",

    "description": "If you thought the worst thing that could happen while making caramel is the sugar burning, think again. You never know just how bad one person can be at cooking or baking until you witness it for yourself. There are some basics that you assume everyone knows, but then you watch your friend making food and they'll casually say something like \"You don't have to wash or peel carrots\" or \"I used baking powder instead of flour, but I think these biscuits will still turn out fine.\" It makes you question everything you know about the fine arts of cooking and baking. And more often than not, taking any kind of recipe shortcut will result in a complete flop.When trying to eat more vegan or vegetarian, you need to use substitutions all the time. It's the fastest way to figure out that almond milk burns quickly and does not really taste like milk in many recipes. You'll start to wonder why your recipes are turning out undercooked or raw just because you used applesauce instead of butter. Unless you follow a proper set of directions to a T, you're going to be eating a lot of unfortunate foods. The people below have some very funny foods they ruined with their own substitutions: give them a read and see if you've ever messed up anything this badly! And as for the caramel mentioned before, that one got really messed up: the cook melted the spoon right into the caramel! You can read the rest of their tale in photo #15. Up next, read about the entitled cafe customer who demanded free coffee: \"[She] said I should honor it because she's a loyal customer.\"",

On the other hand, we know that we still have half of the week left. Not like it really matters to us, we checked out on Tuesday. Sure, we're here in the office, but mentally, we're at home cuddling with our cute cats and binging our current obsession on Netflix (we only have one episode left of Squid Games). That's why we're scrolling through some furbulously funny cat memes instead of actually working (even though our job is to scroll through memes….you get what we're saying).These memes are for all you overworked \u0026 underpaid employees who mentally clocked out in 2012. If you like to spend your hours in your cubicle watching random Youtube videos while sending the occasional email, you're going to love these fluffy felines in meme form. You don't even have to like cats to laugh at them, but who doesn't like cats nowadays? Anyway, you can scroll down to the memes now. Or not, it's your choice.",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/whitespace-a-frontier",
    "description": "Tim has been working on a large C++ project which has been around for many, many years. It's a tool built for, in Tim's words, \"an esoteric field\", and most of the developers over the past 30 years have been PhD students. This particular representative line is present with its original whitespace, and the original variable names. It has been in the code base since 2010. Assignment::Ptr ra = Assignment::makeAssignment(I, addr, func, block, RA); The extra bonus is that Assignment::Ptr is actually an alias for boost::shared_ptr. As you might gather from the name shared_ptr, that's a reference-counted way to manage pointers to memory, and thus avoid memory leaks. The developers just couldn't tolerate using the names provided by their widely used library solving a widely understood problem, and needed to invent their own names, which made the code less clear. The same is true for makeAssignment. And this pattern is used for nearly every class, because the developers involved didn't understand object lifetimes, when to allow things to be stack allocated, or how ownership should really work in an application. This is hardly the only WTF in the code, but Tim says: Preceding the 98 standard, there is a LOT of C-with-classes code. But this representative line speaks to the complete lack of thought that has gone into much of codebase. That whitespace is as-is from the source.

    "description": "There are a lot of cases where the submission is \"this was server side generated JavaScript and they were loading constants\". Which, honestly, is a WTF, but it isn't interesting code. Things like this: if (false === true) { // do stuff } That's absolutely the wrong way to do that, and I hate it, but there's just so many times you can say, \"send server-side values to the client as an object, not inline\". But Daniel's electrical provider decided to come up with an example of this that really takes it to the next level of grossness. var isMobile = \"\" === \"true\"; var isAndroid = \"\" === \"true\"; var isIPad = \"\" === \"true\"; var isIPhone = \"\" === \"true\"; For starters, they're doing device detection on the server side, which isn't the worst possible idea, but it means they're relying on header fields or worse: the user agent string. Maybe they're checking the device resolution. The fact that they're naming specific devices instead of browser capabilities hints at a terrible hackjob of reactive webdesign- likely someone wrote a bunch of JavaScript that alters the desktop stylesheet to cram the desktop site onto a mobile device. But that's just background noise. Look at that code. First, we've got some lovely order-of-operations abuse: === has higher precedence than =, which makes sense but hardly makes this code readable. The first time I saw this, my brain wanted the assignment to happen first. But what's really special to me is the insistence on making this stringly typed. They control both sides of the code, so they could have just done booleans on both sides. And sure, there's a world where they're just dumb, or didn't trust their templating engine to handle that well. I've seen enough bad code, though, to have a different suspicion. I can't confirm it, but c'mon, you know in your hearts this is true: the function which is doing device detection returns a string itself, and that string isn't always a boolean for some reason. So they needed to wrap the output in quotes, because that was the only way to make sure that the JavaScript actually could be executed without a syntax error. I can't be sure that's true from this little snippet. But look at this code, and tell me that someone didn't make that mistake. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.
