    "description": "Cosmetic items in games continue to reach new highs—when it comes to pricing—and lows in terms of the actual value you're getting for what you're paying for. Back when we were playing Nintendo 64s, the last thing any of us would have imagined was that one day, we'd be paying for unfinished games and senseless cosmetics. Now, thanks to the rise of updates and downloadable content, even our favorite and storied developers are shipping games that are missing content to be added later as \"updates\" or DLC.But it can be a way for those who enjoy a game to show their appreciation and even continue to support the developer of their favorite games—even if the skins are \"meaningless\" cosmetics that do little to actually change the game. I have games I paid $50 for that I've spent thousands of hours playing, which, comparatively speaking, is a way better deal than the cable TV my parents were paying for monthly in the 1990s.The problem is that many developers continue to increase prices while offering less, knowing that dedicated player bases and die-hard fans will buy skins for their player models and favorite characters without a second thought—no matter the price. But, arguing that virtual goods have no value because they're \"not real\" was the same argument that was being made over the 90s and 00s about trading cards, and those who \"read the cards right\" back then had the last laugh.",

    "description": "Happy Holidays, everyone! Another year has come and gone. The work is winding down for the year, and families are starting to gather to celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah, and other winter festivities.Many families celebrate by decorating for the holidays. Around Thanksgiving, someone in the family will insist that everyone in the house goes to the attic or basement and bring out all of the decorations. Someone is tasked with untangling the lights, while someone else can start hanging up stockings on the mantle. Picking the perfect Christmas tree is fun for the whole family, too! But as you can see below with this sleigh-full of holiday fails, it's all too easy to mess up your decorations. The cat-owners of the world have a hard time keeping their Christmas tree standing up and decorated. Cats view Christmas trees as their own personal playgrounds! There are branches to climb, shiny baubles to bat at, and even water at the bottom of the tree for them to drink out of (how thoughtful of their owners!). One person shared how their cat demolished all their trees' lights because their cat \"got hungry.\" Oh boy. There's always next year! Happy Holidays from all of us at Fail Blog! May the next year send only the funniest of fails your way. Up next, read about the dollar store boss who's making his employees pay out of pocket for store supplies, leading one befuddled employee to share, \"It's just very weird and customers aren't happy.\"",

    "description": "When we tell you that 2024 has been crazy, oh, we mean it. Because while it's true that cats rule the internet and that there are a million viral cat stories every single year, somehow, this year, it felt like there was more, like people were looking for something to distract them. And one of the most interesting new kinds of viral cat posts that we have seen was about cats with unique and rare fur patterns. Every cat is purrfect, that is known, but there is something meowgical about cats that are a little different than most. Whether it's cats with vitiligo whose fur looks like the night sky or cats with strange eye colors that you swear can see right into your soul. This year, we have spent our time celebrating not only the common but also the things that make us - and cats - unique. So in honor of that, we have decided to put together the most viral, most interesting cats that we have seen this year.",

Last year, we hit a record high of 12 holiday mishaps, and all of the criminals have been identified, but not charged. In fact, they still live in this very house! They paid for their crimes with lots of cuddles, but this year, we're taking matters into our own paws and fortifying our Christmas tree with some festively funny feline memes. That ought to keep those hooligan house cats away…right?Oh, who are we kidding, we know that it won't stop any more crimes from being committed against our Christmas decorations, but it will help us laugh through the pain of cleaning up broken ornaments or torn tinsel for the next couple of days. We love our cats, we love our cats, we love our cats…we really do, but we could do with a little less Christmas chaos this year. Do you think Santa Claws could bring us some of that? Anyway, enjoy these festive, funny feline memes, and we hope your holidays are more Christmas and less Hiss-mas!",

    "description": "Joseph sends us a tried and true classic: bad date handling code, in JavaScript. We've all seen so much bad date handling code that it takes something special to make me do the \"confused dog\" head tilt. var months=new Array(13); months[1]='January'; months[2]='February'; months[3]='March'; months[4]='April'; months[5]='May'; months[6]='June'; months[7]='July'; months[8]='August'; months[9]='September'; months[10]='October'; months[11]='November'; months[12]='December'; var time=new Date(); var lmonth=months[time.getMonth() + 1]; var date=time.getDate(); var year=time.getFullYear(); document.write(lmonth + ' '); document.write(date + ', ' + year); We create a 13 element array to hold our twelve months, because we can't handle it being zero indexed. This array is going to be our lookup table for month names, so I almost forgive making it one-indexed- January is month 1, normally. Almost. Because not only is that stupid, the getMonth() function on a date returns the month as a zero-indexed number. January is month 0. So they need to add one to the result of getMonth for their lookup table to work, and it's just so dumb. Then of course, be output this all using document.write, so we just know it's terrible JavaScript, all the way around.
