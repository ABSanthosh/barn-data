    "description": "I play Rainbow Six Siege every day. I’m absolutely hooked on this game. At first I was just playing it because I wanted to play with my boys and it was something we could all do together, but now I play alone while they're at school. There’s so much to learn between almost a hundred different operators and tons of unique maps with destructible walls which make them ridiculously mutable. I’d say that map awareness is the most important skill you can have in Rainbow Six Siege and that takes a lot of time to get a handle on. I’ve been playing for months now and I feel like I understand the various bomb sites in each map but I’m just starting to understand the connective tissue between sites and how everything connects. The game having so much to learn is part of the reason I think I’m still hooked. Every game I play I’m still learning and that’s rewarding.",

The metaphor continues from there, because my era of cheats always had a dark nimbus; you were just rawdogging some mysterioso executable. God only knows what you're gonna catch. Matters are different now for cheats, to hear Mork's boys tell it, because they're essentially things you subscribe to. I'd never looked them up. I was curious how hard it would be to find, and they're, uh, not. They're not hard to find. I was startled at the professionalism - the 24/7 support line, the layout, and of course the fifty dollar a month price tag. Let me emphasize again: there is a support line for these game-shredding hacks. Kiko enunciated it well; in the era of service gaming, not just an assemblage of random hosts, it's a constant war like that of an immune system. The cheats, then, must be services also.",

    "description": "Most of us probably have that item of clothing that we wear whenever we can. When we're wearing it, we feel good, we look good, and most importantly, we are comfortable. As we get older, comfort takes priority, and looking smart is just an added bonus. Of course, if your favorite item of clothing is your Crocs, you're not ever going to look smart, but more power to you because at least you'll look out of place in a nice restaurant in unparalleled comfort.Whether it was picking apples or fancy date-night dinners, the boyfriend's Crocs were always on his feet, raising the question for his girlfriend of whether he was taking their relationship seriously at all, especially once he admitted to dressing nicer for other activities like going to his university classes. She turned to this online community to see whether or not she was in the wrong for insisting that he change his footwear to better suit the occasion that they were attending, which had caused a rift between the couple.It stands to reason here that while we're not wholly responsible for other people's perceptions and the way that they feel, we can still take their feelings into account, and if your partner is feeling disrespected by what they feel is a lack of care, that's really something the two of you need to sort out. Still, at the same time, you can't really go around insisting that someone change their ways to suit your tastes so that factors in too.",

    "description": "If you could change just one thing about your local hospital or doctor's office, what would it be? Many people would immediately know the answer: shorter wait times! No one wants to spend long hours in the waiting room while they're feeling their worst (not to mention having to hang out with a bunch of other people who are coughing or sneezing). Other people would suggest better hospital food, or a quieter room without beeping or having to deal with a roommate behind a curtain. There are plenty of helpful suggestions one could make, and below are the funniest, least helpful suggestions out there. It all started when the NHS (National Health Service) of England put out an open call for suggestions to make their service better. They did this via an online anonymous suggestion site, and we all know the internet cannot take anything seriously. People had hilarious suggestions, like banning apples since they keep doctors away, or turning down the heating by a single degree. You can check out some of the funniest examples compiled by @llwtydeer and other X users down below. Up next, have a laugh at these staircases that are going to make a few people go airborne, like one person who noticed that a flight of stairs \"aren't attached to the ground.\"",

Where once we worked tirelessly in the fields, we now kick back in comfy corporate chairs designed to support our entire body. So it should come as no surprise that new titles such as Pillow Princess are becoming commonplace in the job market as we transition towards personality dependent jobs, where we supply a certain characteristic to earn a hard day's pay. And that is why we made this list detailing the advice of this pawdorable pillow princess about what it takes to be so high achieving in one's career through the medium of heartwarming feline memes.She has offered up such gems as \"i am with yapping or napping\", a pertinent example of what it looks like to give it your all and work unusual hours, to the motto she lives by \"another day, another slay\", strong words to live by if you are looking to slay every single day.",

    "description": "Let's face it: we hoomans are all simply pawns in our felines' games. No matter how hard we try to convince ourselves that we are in charge, a sassy cat will strut into your life and flip all of your beliefs upside down. Oh, you like leather couches? They'll scratch it until it's unrecognizable. Do you enjoy showering with the curtain closed? They'll rip it down so you can't get any purrivacy. Once you become a cat pawrent, you also have to trash any beliefs you had about owning a furry feline friend and start from scratch (see what I did there?)Some cats act out sparingly while others have had sassy purrsonalities since birth. Who are we to judge? They might seem impawssible to deal with sometimes, but that's the price of having an ancient animal roaming through our homes. We must honor them as such—even if they only have one brain cell. Maybe they view us the same way.

    "description": "When processing HTTP requests, you frequently need to check the parameters which were sent along with that request. Those parameters are generally passed as stringly-typed key/value pairs. None of this is news to anyone. What is news, however, is how Brodey's co-worker indexed the key/value pairs. For i As Integer = 0 To (Request.Params().Count - 1) If (parameters.GetKey(i).ToString() \u003c\u003e \"Lang\") Then If (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"ID\")) OrElse (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"new\")) OrElse _ (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"open\")) OrElse (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"FID\")) _ OrElse (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"enabled\")) OrElse (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"my\")) OrElse _ (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"msgType\")) OrElse (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"Type\")) _ OrElse (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"EID\")) OrElse (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"Title\")) OrElse _ (parameters.GetKey(i).Equals(\"ERROR\")) Then URLParams \u0026= \"\u0026\" \u0026 parameters.GetKey(i).ToString() URLParams \u0026= \"=\" \u0026 parameters(i).ToString() End If End If Next The goal of this code is to take a certain set of keys and construct a URLParams string which represents those key/values as an HTTP query string. The first thing to get out of the way: .NET has a QueryString type that handles the construction of the query string for you (including escaping), so that you don't need to do any string concatenation. But the real WTF is everything surrounding that. We opt to iterate across every key- not just the ones we care about- and use the GetKey(i) function to check each individual key in an extensive chain of OrElse statements. The obvious and simpler approach would have been to iterate across an array of the keys I care about- ID, new, FID, enabled, my, msgType, Type, EID, Title, ERROR- and simply check if they were in the Request. I suppose the only silver lining here is that they thought to use the OrElse operator- which is a short-circuiting \"or\" operation, like you'd expect in just about any other language, instead of Or, which doesn't short circuit (pulling double duty as both a bitwise Or and a logical Or, because Visual Basic wants to contribute some WTFs).

    "description": "Our stories come from you, our readers- which, it's worth reminding everyone, keep those submissions coming in. There's nothing on this site without your submissions. Now, we do get some submissions which don't make the page. Frequently, it's simply because we simply don't have enough context from the submission to understand it or comment on it effectively. Often, it's just not that remarkable. And sometimes, it's because the code isn't a WTF at all. So I want to discuss some of these, because I think it's still interesting. And it's unfair to expect everyone to know everything, so for the submitters who discover they didn't understand why this code isn't bad, you're one of today's lucky 10,000. We start with this snippet, from Guss: #define FEATURE_SENSE_CHAN (1 \u003c\u003c 0) #define FEATURE_SENSE_PEER (1 \u003c\u003c 1) Guss writes: The Asterisk open source telephony engine has some features that need to know from which direction they've been invoked in a two-way call. This is called \"sense\" in the Asterisk lingo, and there are two macros defined in the source which allow you to textually know if you're talking about this direction or the other. This of course stands for 1 and 0 respectively, but they couldn't have just simply go on and say that - it has to be \"interesting\". Do also note, as this is a macro, it means that whenever someone sets or tests the \"sense\", another redundant bit shift operation is done. First, minor detail- this stands for 1 and 2 respectively. And what's important here is that these fields are clearly meant to be a bitmask. And when we're talking about a bitmask, using bitshift operators makes the code more clear. And we can generally rely on a shift by zero bits to be a no-op, and any compiler should be smart enough to spot that and optimize the operation out. Hell, a quick check with GCC shows that even the (1 \u003c\u003c 1) gets optimized to just the constant 0x2. Not a WTF, but it does highlight something we've commented on in the past- bitmasks can be confusing for people. This is a good example of that. But not only is this not a WTF, but it's not even bad code. (Now, it may be the case that these are never really used as a bitmask, in which case, that's a mild WTF, but that's not what Guss was drawing our attention to) In other cases, the code is bad, but it may be reacting to the badness it's surrounded by. Greg inherited this blob from some offshore contractors: RegistryKey RK = Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey(\"SOFTWARE\\\\XXXXX\\\\YYYYY\"); string BoolLog = \"\"; if (RK != null) BoolLog = ((string)RK.GetValue(\"LogSocket\", \"\")).ToLower(); if (BoolLog == \"true\" || BoolLog == \"yes\" || BoolLog == \"1\") { ... } Now, seeing a string variable called BoolLog is a big red flag about bad code inbound. And we see handling some stringly typed boolean data to try and get a truth value. Which all whiffs of bad code. But let's talk about the Windows Registry. It's typed, but the types are strings, lists of strings, and various numeric types. There's no strictly boolean type. And sure, while explicitly storing a 1 in a numeric field is probably a better choice for the registry than string booleans, there are reasons why you might do that (especially if you frequently need to modify Registry keys by hand, like when you're debugging). The real WTF, in this case, isn't this code, but is instead the Windows Registry. Having a single tree store be the repository for all your system configuration sounds like a good idea on paper, but as anyone who's worked with it has discovered- it's a nightmare. The code here isn't terrible. It's not good, but it's a natural reaction to the terrible world in which it lives. Sometimes, the code is actually downright awful, but it's just hard to care about too much. Rudolf was shopping for bulk LEDs, which inevitably leads one to all sorts of websites based in China offering incredibly cheap prices and questionable quality control. The site Rudolf was looking at had all sorts of rendering glitches, and so out of curiosity, he viewed the source. {\\rtf1\\ansi\\ansicpg1252\\deff0\\deflang2055{\\fonttbl{\\f0\\froman\\fcharset0 Times New Roman;}{\\f1\\fswiss\\fcharset0 Arial;}} {\\*\\generator Msftedit 5.41.21.2509;}\\viewkind4\\uc1\\pard\\f0\\fs24 \u003chtml\u003e\\par \\par \u003chead\u003e \u003cmeta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"1; url=http://totally-fine-leds-really-its-fine.ch\"\u003e \\par Here we see someone wrote their HTML in WordPad, and saved the file as an RTF, instead of a plain text file. Which sure, is bad. But again, we need to put this in context: this almost certainly isn't the page for handling any transactions or sales (that almost certainly uses a prebaked ecommerce plugin). This is their approach to letting \"regular\" users upload content to the site- frequently documentation pages. This isn't a case where some developer should have known better messed up- this is almost certainly some sales person who has an HTML template to fill in and upload. It probably stretches their technical skills to the limit to \"Save As…\" in WordPad. So the code isn't bad. Again, the environment in which it sits is bad. But this is a case where the environment doesn't matter- these kinds of sites are really hoping to score some B2B sales in bulk quantities, and \"customer service\" and \"useful website\" isn't going to drive sales better than \"bargain basement prices\" will. They're not trying to sell to consumers, they're trying to sell to a company which will put these into consumer products. Honestly, we should be grateful that they at least tried to make an HTML file, and didn't just upload PDFs, which is usually what you find on these sites. Sometimes, we don't have a WTF. Sometimes, we have a broken world that we can just do our best to navigate. We must simply do our best. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time.
