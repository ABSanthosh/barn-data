    "description": "Sharing: one of those core lessons that is so important to learn at a young age, necessary to learn so that you'll one day grow up to be a well-adjusted person. An all-important lesson that everyone should learn, but some people just… don't. However, sharing is just as much about knowing when something isn't yours to have or take as it is about when you should be sharing your own things. You can't just simply demand that someone share something with you and have it be so. Kids, of course, get this wrong all the time. This is why adults are around to steer them in the right direction and teach them when they slip up. But, adults who never learned this lesson properly make for poor captains on a ship they've never been on before.",

    "description": "Unfortunately, the number of people who regret becoming parents grows every single year, or at least that is how it seems like, with how much those parents are talking about it.I have seen my fair share of mothers on social media talking about how, even though they love their kids, they often wish they didn't jump into parenthood as quickly as they did, and how much they miss the freedom they had before they decided to raise another human being. While I think it's brave to share these feelings online, I also often wonder why they feel the need to share those dark thoughts with the world. Then I imagine it is mostly a cautionary tale, to \"warn\" other women to think twice before they make such a commitment, because it is not something they can ever take back. Or at least, that is the case for most parents.Some parents not only regret their choice, but they actually end up backing out of the whole parenting thing altogether.",

    "description": "The bond between a hooman and their favorite cat will never break, even if that kitty is not actually yours. Finding a stray on the street is always a heartbreaking experience for a cat lover. Desperately skinny, meowing for help, and likely covered in indignant clouds of dirt, outdoor cats cling to the nearest hooman servant, hoping for a cuddle, a pet, or even a tin of tuna to aid their kitty quest. But not every cat out there is on some kind of quest; in fact, many cats simply get lost, hoping to find their way home somehow. But when you're sharing a brain cell with your other kitty brethren, finding home all by your lonesome isn't so easy. So when this kind hooman found a lost cat out in the wild, she gleefully brought it under her wing. However, less than 24 hours later, and after sleeping on the bathroom floor with her new favorite cat, the original owner was found. What's a cat lover to do? Well, the \"right thing,\" of course.",

    "description": "Hey there, pawrents of the internet. We know you know how lucky you are, but it never hurts to be reminded. We get to experience the meowgical beings that are cats literally every day - we get to cuddle with them, see them as they make adorable airplane ears, and simply bask in their cat-like glory. Not only that, but having deemed ourselves worthy of their love, we get to be loved by them. And that, dear friends, is the greatest gift of all.There is no love like a cat's love. Dogs love everyone and they aren't afraid to show it. Cats are picky about the hoomans they love, and once you're chosen, you're chosen for life. Sure, they might get a little grumpy if you feed them late too many times, but they will be yours furever despite it all. We found a heartwarming helping of lovestruck felines that we just had to share with you, to remind you how lucky we are to be so loved by our cat companions. Enjoy!",

    "description": "DZ's tech lead is a doctor of computer science, and that doctor loves to write code. But you already know that \"PhD\" stands for \"Piled high and deep\", and that's true of the tech lead's clue. For example, in C#: private List ExtractListForId(string id) { List list = new List(); lock (this) { var items = _foos.Where(f =\u003e f.Id == id).ToList(); foreach (var item in items) { list.Add(item); } } return list; } The purpose of this function is to find all the elements in a list where they have a matching ID. That's accomplished in one line: _foo.Where(f =\u003e f.Id == id). For some reason, the function goes through the extra step of iterating across the returned list and constructing a new one. There's no real good reason for this, though it does force LINQ to be eager- by default, the Where expression won't be evaluated until you check the results. The lock is in there for thread safety, which hey- the enumerator returned by Where is not threadsafe, so that's not a useless thing to do there. But it's that lock which hints at the deeper WTF here: our PhD-having-tech-lead knows that adding threads ensures you're using more of the CPU, and they've thrown threads all over the place without any real sense to it. There's no clear data ownership of any given thread, which means everything is locked to hell and back, the whole thing frequently deadlocks, and it's impossible to debug. It's taken days for DZ to get this much of a picture of what's going on in the code, and further untangling of this multithreaded pile of spaghetti is going to take many, many more days- and much, much more of DZ's sanity.
