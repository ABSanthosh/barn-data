    "description": "We know that people say that cats are independent creatures who like their space and their alone time. We know that cats are not always known for being the friendliest. We know that cats don't always have the easiest time connecting with others. We know it. We just haven't seen it many times. Seriously. In our experience, cats bond with humans or other animals incredibly hard and fast. Maybe they are not the most social creatures, but cats sure do love their cuddles. And when cats lose someone that they love, someone that they are close to, one of those creatures that they have bonded with… they certainly feel that loss very strongly. All that love that they have to give - and there is a lot of it - needs a place to go. And that's certainly true for the kittens in this story - both of them. Both orphaned, one losing its brother too… they found one another and connected because they were meant to. And although they are not biologically related, these kittens will be siblings for life.",

    "description": "The interview process is a long and arduous one for both sides, really, and the last thing anyone wants is for their time to be wasted after such a long process. The relief that comes after simultaneously finally securing a role or finally having someone to fill an empty position on the team is understated, turning energies next towards developing and furthering the burgeoning relationship. While you can expect a lot of anxiety on the first day on the part of the candidate, the last thing you expect is to actually be fired on or before your first day—let alone three mere hours after being hired and shown around the office.Yet, that's what happened to this candidate when they received an email from their would-be new employer hours after signing on with the company and being toured around their offices, informing them that there had been changes to the \"circumstances\" of their position and the person they were supposed to be replacing had decided to stay on, meaning that there was no longer a role available for them. Frustrated and disheartened, they shared their experience with this online community, sharing screenshots of the email itself and their story.",

    "description": "This uncle is wondering if he taught his child and nephew the right lessons. After all, teaching your child right from wrong is an ongoing lesson throughout their life. The ways that most kids learn what to do and not to do is by watching how the adults in their lives act. That's why u/Some_Addition_9752 headed to r/AITAH to ask a larger audience if they were right for the way they encouraged their child to act. As a parent, it's frustrating to buy your kids expensive toys knowing they could quickly be stolen or broken. It's even more frustrating when you know exactly who pilfered the toys! This person revealed that their nephew took a bunch of Legos and other toys from their home after a visit. Why? Because he \"really liked them.\" It's good to share, but it seems like this 8-year-old just took the toys and ran with them, instead of asking permission. Then, to make matters worse, the original poster's brother barely did anything about his child's theft. He casually mentioned he'd return the items… but he clearly wasn't too concerned about it. Although commenters told the original poster that they weren't wrong, it seems like maybe they and their brother and nephew just shouldn't hang out so much. If they have communication problems that are escalating like this, it's probably a bigger issue than just some stolen Legos. After that, these people had some strong motivations to quit their jobs, like one person who was bitter that they were \"given a 1 cent raise.\"",

I’ve been doing these for a few months now and I love it. Working directly with PA readers to craft something special for them has been incredibly cool. When you sign up for a commission I need you to send me all the information you can about the character you’re looking for as well as whether you want a background or not since I offer both options. I’m happy to draw characters from comics,games,movies, RPG’s or even original designs. I even drew someone’s family dog a couple months ago!  I use the site Artistree which allows us to communicate through the entire process and you’ll have multiple opportunities to give feedback and make adjustments as we work through sketches, inks and finally colors. Once we’re done I’ll send over the high res files that are suitable for printing.",

    "description": "\"Check out Visual Studio optimizing their rating system to only include the ratings used,\" shared Fiorenzo R. Imagine the performance gain!   \"This sounds about right,\" says Colin A.   \"Wow! Must snap up some sweet Anker kit with this amazing offer; but less than four days to go!\" exclaims Dave L., who then goes on to explain \"The actual WTF is this though. I sent this image to Anker with this email: But only 3days left? I hope this offer continues! Anker replied: Thank you for your feedback! I understand that you appreciate the savings on the Anker SOLIX PS100 Portable Solar Panel and wish the offer could be extended beyond the current 3-day limit. Your suggestion is valuable and will be considered for future promotions to enhance customer satisfaction. If you have any other requests or need further assistance, please let me know. I for one welcome our new AI overlords. \"   Graham F. almost stashed this away for later. \"Looks like Dropbox could use a few lessons in how to do Maths! Although maybe their definition of 'almost' differs from mine.\"   Finally Joshua found time to report a brand-new date-handling bug. \"Teams is so buggy; this one just takes the cake. I had to check with the unix cal program to make sure I wasn't completely bonkers.\" For the readers, November 8 this year is supposed to be a Friday. I suppose things could change after the US election.   Have a great weekend. Maybe I'll see you next Friday, or maybe all the weekdays will be renamed Thursday.

    "description": "Horror movies, as of late, have gone to great lengths to solve the key obstacle to horror movies- cell phones. When we live in a world where help is a phone call away, it's hard to imagine the characters not doing that. So screenwriters put them in situations where this is impossible: in Midsommar they isolate them in rural Sweden, in Get Out calling the police is only going to put our protagonist in more danger. But what's possibly more common is making the film a period piece- like the X/Pearl/Maxxxine trilogy, Late Night with the Devil, or Netflix's continuing series of R.L. Stine adaptations. I bring this up, because today's horror starts in 1993. A Norwegian software company launched its software product to mild acclaim. Like every company, it had its ups and downs, its successes and missteps. On the surface, it was a decent enough place to work. Over the years, the company tried to stay up to date with technology. In 1993, the major languages one might use for launching a major software product, your options are largely C or Pascal. Languages like Python existed, but weren't widely used or even supported on most systems. But the company stayed in business and needed to update their technology as time passed, which meant the program gradually grew and migrated to new languages. Which meant, by the time Niklas F joined the company, they were on C#. Even though they'd completely changed languages, the codebase still derived from the original C codebase. And that meant that the codebase had many secrets, dark corners, and places a developer should never look. Like every good horror movie protagonist, Niklas heard the \"don't go in there!\" and immediately went in there. And lurking in those shadows was the thing every developer fears the most: homebrew date handling code. /// /// /// /// /// public static DateTime LastDayInMonth(DateTime dt) { int day = 30; switch (dt.Month) { case 1: day = 31; break; case 2: if (IsLeapYear(dt)) day = 29; else day = 28; break; case 3: day = 31; break; case 4: day = 30; break; case 5: day = 31; break; case 6: day = 30; break; case 7: day = 31; break; case 8: day = 31; break; case 9: day = 30; break; case 10: day = 31; break; case 11: day = 30; break; case 12: day = 31; break; } return new DateTime(dt.Year, dt.Month, day, 0, 0, 0); } /// /// /// /// /// public static bool IsLeapYear(DateTime dt) { bool ret = (((dt.Year % 4) == 0) \u0026\u0026 ((dt.Year % 100) != 0) || ((dt.Year % 400) == 0)); return ret; } For a nice change of pace, this code isn't incorrect. Even the leap year calculation is actually correct (though my preference would be to just return the expression instead of using a local variable). But that's what makes this horror all the more insidious: there are built-in functions to handle all of this, but this code works and will likely continue to work, just sitting there, like a demon that we've made a pact with. And suddenly we realize this isn't Midsommar but Ari Aster's other hit film, Hereditary, and we're trapped being in a lineage of monsters, and can't escape our inheritance. .comment {border: none;} [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.
