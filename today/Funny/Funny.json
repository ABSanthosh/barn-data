    "description": "Spending the holidays with your husband's ex-wife sounds like prime material for a straight-to-streaming holiday-themed romantic comedy, but the reality is that it's not nearly as funny when it is your reality.This stepmother turned to this online community for advice on a complex personal problem she was facing and wondered if she was in the wrong for encouraging her 19-year-old stepdaughter to speak up about ending their joint family holiday gatherings with the stepdaughter's mother, her husband's ex-wife.  Surely, this tradition was begun with the best of intentions: an attempt at co-parenting between divorced parents to keep the family together for the holidays. The problem is that even though everyone is together, no one is having any fun, and the \"awkward\" gatherings are joyless and spoil the intended spirit of the holidays.Sometimes, in life, rituals and traditions outlive their welcome, and our unwillingness to let them go simply holds us back. This seemed to be the case with this family, which is why the stepmother prodded her stepdaughter to speak up to her parents about how much she didn't enjoy these holiday gatherings and put an end to them.",

    "description": "This snow shoveler knows they were being petty towards their neighbor, and they do not care one bit. In some parts of the world, snow days are still quite common. Some storms can dump buckets of the white stuff, leaving people to dig out their cars while their kids build snow forts. Shoveling a driveway or digging your car out can take ages. You have to scrape the snow from the windshield, dig out the tires, scrape the ice from the door handles, and after all that's done, you still need to dig a path for your car to get out of the driveway. It truly can take all day, and if it's still snowing, you might find yourself out there again the next day doing the same exact thing all over again. That's why this person was absolutely infuriated when a neighbor took the parking spot they spent hours shoveling. With a full 8 inches of snow on the ground, it must've been backbreaking work! You can read the full story below, as well as comments from people who agreed that when you mess around with the wrong person, you'll find out soon enough. Up next, these HR professionals revealed what happened when they had to fire an employee for some bizarre reasons, like one dude who \"bought a car on the company card and… got fired.\"",

    "description": "Hello cat-loving humans. Those of us who have cats at home know that there is never a dull moment with your faithful feline companions. One moment you could gaze at them sleeping on the dog's bed, snoring softly but adorably, the next moment they're knocking over all of your good china. Oh yeah, things get real interesting real fast. One thing however remains consistent, and that is the way that our cats simultaneously bring both joy and chaos to our every day human lives. Cats make life so much more interesting. On that note, I'm thinking back to a time when I flew across the country with my cat to visit family, and he was being such a good boy just sleeping in his carrier throughout the flight. I had managed to doze off on this flight, which was about 6 hours of flight time total, only to feel a tap at my shoulder a few moments later. The person next to me alerted me that my cat had escaped from his carrier and was making his rounds around the plane. And that just about sums up the joy and chaos of being a cat parent. Enjoy all the silliness!",

We wouldn't know, we're definitely not a cat typing this listicle right now, we're 100% hooman. We pay taxes, go to work, and only eat tuna once per day. Anyway, as we were saying, life can be a real hairball sometimes. If we need something to help us get through a purrticularly pawful day, we turn to wholesome funny feline memes. They're like our medicine, but this medicine is a catnip-coated spoonful of sugar. Us hoomans love catnip too, right? Can't get enough of it!Erm, we mean, we like catnip just as much as the next hooman. But back to these silly cats that make our days better, they're just the cat's meow. And we're not saying that because we're a cat, remember, it's just a normal hooman expression. We feel like we're not really getting our paw across here. Point! We meant to say point. Just scroll down already and enjoy this listicle, catnip or not (but it's better with catnip…right?).",

    "description": "Charles is supporting a PHP based application. One feature of the application is a standard \"Contact Us\" form. I'll let Charles take on the introduction: While it looks fine on the outside, the code is a complete mess. The entire site is built with bad practices, redundant variables, poor validation, insecure cookie checks, and zero focus on maintainability or security. Even the core parts of the platform are a nightmare We're going to take this one in chunks, because it's big and ugly. try { if (isset($_POST)) { $name = $_POST['objName']; $lst_name = $_POST['objLstName']; $email = $_POST['objEmail']; $phone = $_POST['objGsm']; $message = $_POST['objMsg']; $verifycode = $_POST['objVerifyCode']; /******************************************************/ $objCmpT = $_POST['objCmpT']; $objCmpS = $_POST['objCmpS']; $objCountry = $_POST['objCountry']; $objCity = $_POST['objCity']; $objName2 = $_POST['objName2']; $objLstName2 = $_POST['objLstName2']; $objQuality = $_POST['objQuality']; $objEmail = $_POST['objEmail']; $objMsg2 = $_POST['objMsg2']; $objVerifyCode2 = $_POST['objVerifyCode2']; I don't love that there's no structure or class here, to organize these fields, but this isn't bad, per se. We have a bunch of form fields, and we jam them into a bunch of variables. I am going to, with no small degree of willpower, not comment on the hungarian notation present in the field names. Look at me not commenting on it. I'm definitely not commenting on it. Look at me not commenting that some, but not all, of the variables also get the same hungarian prefix. What's the point of hungarian notation when everything just gets the same thing anyway; like hungarian is always bad, but this is just USELESS Ahem. Let's continue with the code. $ok = 0; $ok2 = 0; $sendTo = \"example@example.com\"; $golableMSG = ' -First Name \u0026 Last Name :' . $name . ' ' . $lst_name . ' -email :' . $email . ' -Phone Number : 0' . $phone . ' -Message : ' . $message; $globaleMSG2 = ' -First Name \u0026 Last Name :' . $objName2 . ' ' . $objLstName2 . ' -Email :' . $objEmail . ' -Type of company : ' . $objCmpT . ' -Sector of activity : ' . $objCmpS . ' -Country : ' . $objCountry . ' -City : ' . $objCity . ' -Your position within the company : ' . $objQuality . ' -Message : ' . $objMsg2; We munge all those form fields into strings. These are clearly going to be the bodies of our messages. Only now I'm noticing that the user had to supply two different names- $name and $objName2. Extra points here, as I believe they meant to name both of these message variables globaleMSG but misspelled the first one, golableMSG. Well, let's continue. if (!$name) { $data['msg1'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg1'] = ''; } if (!$lst_name) { $data['msg2'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg2'] = ''; } if (!$email) { $data['msg3'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg3'] = ''; } if ($phone \u003c= 0) { $data['msg4'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg4'] = ''; } if (!$message) { $data['msg5'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg5'] = ''; } if (!$verifycode) { $data['msg6'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg6'] = ''; } /*********************************************************************************/ if (!$objCmpS) { $data['msg7'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg7'] = ''; } if (!$objCountry) { $data['msg8'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg8'] = ''; } if (!$objCity) { $data['msg9'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg9'] = ''; } if (!$objName2) { $data['msg10'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg10'] = ''; } if (!$objLstName2) { $data['msg11'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg11'] = ''; } if (!$objQuality) { $data['msg12'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg12'] = ''; } if (!$objMsg2) { $data['msg13'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg13'] = ''; } if (!$objVerifyCode2) { $data['msg14'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg14'] = ''; } What… what are we doing here? I worry that what I'm looking at here is some sort of preamble to verification code. But why is it like this? Why? /********************************************************************************/ if ($ok == 6) { if (preg_match(\"/^[ a-z,.+!:;()-]+$/\", $name)) { $data['msg1_1'] = ''; if (preg_match(\"/^[ a-z,.+!:;()-]+$/\", $lst_name)) { $data['msg2_2'] = ''; $subject = $name . \" \" . $lst_name; if (filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) { $data['msg3_3'] = ''; $from = $email; if (preg_match(\"/^[6-9][0-9]{8}$/\", $phone)) { $data['msg4_4'] = ''; if (intval($verifycode) == intval($_COOKIE['nmbr1']) + intval($_COOKIE['nmbr2'])) { $data['msg6_6'] = ''; $headers = 'From: ' . $from . \"\\r\\n\" . 'Reply-To: ' . $sendTo . \"\\r\\n\" . 'X-Mailer: PHP/' . phpversion(); mail($sendTo, $subject, $golableMSG, $headers); $data['msgfinal'] = 'Votre Messsage est bien envoyer'; /*$data = array('success' =\u003e 'Votre Messsage est bien envoyer', 'postData' =\u003e $_POST);*/ } else { $data['msg6_6'] = 'votre resultat est incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg4_4'] = 'Votre Numéro est incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg3_3'] = 'Votre Email est incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg2_2'] = 'Votre Prénom est Incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg1_1'] = 'Votre Nom est Incorrect'; } } Oh look, it is validation code. Their verification code system, presumably to prevent spamming messages, is not particularly secure or useful. The real thing I see here, though, is the namespaced keys. Earlier, we set $data['msg1'], and now we're setting $data['msg1_1'] which is a code stench that could kill from a hundred yards. And don't worry, we do the same thing for the other message we send: /**************************************************************/ if ($ok2 == 8) { if (preg_match(\"/^[ a-z,.+!:;()-]+$/\", $objName2)) { $data['msg10_10'] = ''; if (preg_match(\"/^[ a-z,.+!:;()-]+$/\", $objLstName2)) { $data['msg11_11'] = ''; $subject2 = $objName2 . \" \" . $objLstName2; if (intval($objVerifyCode2) == intval($_COOKIE['nmbr3']) + intval($_COOKIE['nmbr4'])) { $from2 = $objEmail; $data['msg14_14'] = ''; $headers2 = 'From: ' . $from2 . \"\\r\\n\" . 'Reply-To: ' . $sendTo . \"\\r\\n\" . 'X-Mailer: PHP/' . phpversion(); mail($sendTo, $subject2, $globaleMSG2, $headers2); $data['msgfinal'] = 'Votre Messsage est bien envoyer'; } else { $data['msg14_14'] = 'votre resultat est incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg11_11'] = 'Votre Prénom est Incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg10_10'] = 'Votre Nom est Incorrect'; } } Phew. Hey, remember way back at the top, when we checked to see if the $_POST variable were set? Well, we do have an else clause for that. } else { throw new \\Exception($mot[86]); } Who doesn't love throwing messages by hard-coded array indexes in your array of possible error messages? Couldn't be bothered with a constant, could we? Nope, message 86 it is. But don't worry about that exception going uncaught. Remember, this whole thing was inside of a try: } catch (\\Exception $e) { $data['msgfinal'] = \"Votre Messsage n'est pas bien envoyer\"; /*$data = array('danger' =\u003e 'Votre Messsage pas bien envoyer', 'postData' =\u003e $_POST);*/ } Yeah, it didn't matter what message we picked, because we just catch the exception and hard-code out an error message. Also, I don't speak French, but is \"message\" supposed to have an extra \"s\" in it? Charles writes: It’s crazy to see such sloppy work on a platform that seems okay at first glance. Honestly, this platform is the holy grail of messy code—it could have its own course on how not to code because of how bad and error-prone it is. There are also even worse scenarios of bad code, but it's too long to share, and honestly, they're too deep and fundamentally ingrained in the system to even begin explaining. Oh, I'm sure we could explain it. The explanation may be \"there was a severe and fatal lack of oxygen in the office, and this is what hypoxia looks like in code,\" but I'm certain there'd be an explanation. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
