    "description": "Businesses always want to save money. But boy, they can sometimes come up with some hare-brained ways of doing it. Original --Remy Things weren't looking good for IniOil. It was the 1980s in the US: greed was good, anti-trust laws had been literally Borked, and financialization and mergers were eating up the energy industry. IniOil was a small fish surrounded by much larger fish, and the larger fish were hungry. Gordon was their primary IT person. He managed a farm of VAXes and other minicomputers, which geologists used to do complicated models to predict where oil might be found. In terms of utilization, the computer room was arguably the most efficient space in the company: those computers may have been expensive, but they were burning 24/7 to find more oil to extract. The CEO sent out a memo. \"Due to economic conditions,\" it read, \"we are going to have to cut costs and streamline.\" Cutting costs and streamlining meant \"hiring a bunch of Ivy League MBAs\" who had a long list of reforms they wanted the company to adopt. One of them was to force all the various business units to use internal billing and charge other business units for their services. At first, this looked like a good thing for Gordon. Their overhead costs were low- the IT team was small, and the VAXes were reliable, and the workloads were well understood. Billing out computer time was going to make all their metrics look amazing. Unfortunately, facilities also was a billable unit. And they charged by square foot. Suddenly, the IT team was paying through the nose for the computer room. What really stuck in Gordon's craw, however, was that it seemed like the computer room was getting billed at a more expensive rate than anything else in the building- it was about the same size as the sales floor, but was billed at double the rate. Gordon raised this with facilities. \"That's not true,\" they said. \"We bill by the square foot. You've got twice as much square footage.\" Gordon insisted that the computer room did not. He broke out a tape measure, went to the sales floor, took some measurements, then went to the computer room and repeated it. The difference was a matter of a few square feet. Gordon went back to facilities. \"Your measurements are wrong.\" \"They're square rooms,\" Gordon said. \"How wrong could I be? A factor of two? Do you want to take the measurements?\" Facilities didn't need to take measurements. They had drawings. And the drawings showed a room that was 80'x80'… and was 12,800 sq ft. Gordon pointed out how that didn't make sense, by basic arithmetic, and the facilities manager tapped an annotation on the drawing. \"Raised flooring\". Because the computer room had a raised floor, facilities was counting it as twice the floor space. Gordon tried to argue with facilities, pointing out that no matter how many raised floors were added, the actual building square footage did not change. But every business unit was looking to cut costs and boost internal profits, which meant \"seeing reason\" wasn't high on the facilities priority list. Gordon raised it up with management, but everyone was too panicked by the threat of mergers and losing jobs to start a major fight over it. Facilities said the square footage was 12,800, then that's what it was. But Gordon's management had a solution. \"Gordon,\" his boss said. \"Remove the raised flooring. Just rip it out.\" It was a quick and easy way to turn high billing rates into trip hazards and risks to equipment, but nobody was paying for risk mitigation and if there were any injuries because someone tripped over a cable, that'd come out of some other team's budget anyway. For a few months, the computer room was a hazard site, but the rent was at least cheap. In the end, though, none of it mattered- all the MBA driven cost \"savings\" weren't enough to stop a much bigger oil company from swallowing up IniOil. Most of the employees lost their jobs. The execs who owned most of the shares got a huge payout. And, well, the purchaser was interested in land leases and mineral rights, not computer rooms, so the VAXes were broken down and sold to a few universities.

    "description": "As we recap some of the best moments of the year, make sure you check this report, which is very important, so important the entire company has to stop what it's doing. Original. --Remy Branon's boss, Steve, came storming into his cube. From the look of panic on his face, it was clear that this was a full hair-on-fire emergency. \"Did we change anything this weekend?\" \"No,\" Branon said. \"We never deploy on a weekend.\" \"Well, something must have changed?!\" After a few rounds of this, Steve's panic wore off and he explained a bit more clearly. Every night, their application was supposed to generate a set of nightly reports and emailed them out. These reports went to a number of people in the company, up to and including the CEO. Come Monday morning, the CEO checked his inbox and horror of horror- there was no report! \"And going back through people's inboxes, this seems like it's been a problem for months- nobody seems to have received one for months.\" \"Why are they just noticing now?\" Branon asked. \"That's really not the problem here. Can you investigate why the emails aren't going out?\" Branon put aside his concerns, and agreed to dig through and debug the problem. Given that it involved sending emails, Branon was ready to spend a long time trying to debug whatever was going wrong in the chain. Instead, finding the problem only took about two minutes, and most of that was spent getting coffee. public void Send() { //TODO: send email here } This application had been in production over a year. This function had not been modified in that time. So while it's technically true that no one had received a report \"for months\" (16 months is a number of months), it would probably have been more accurate to say that they had never received a report. Now, given that it had been over a year, you'd think that maybe this report wasn't that important, but now that the CEO had noticed, it was the most important thing at the company. Work on everything else stopped until this was done- mind you, it only took one person a few hours to implement and test the feature, but still- work on everything else stopped. A few weeks later a new ticket was opened: people felt that the nightly reports were too frequent, and wanted to instead just go to the site to pull the report, which is what they had been doing for the past 16 months. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds.

    "description": "Being adopted by a cat can be very dramatic sometimes. Maybe a kitten stops your car by yelling and demands that you take it home with you. Maybe you rescue a frozen kitten, and then, just as it's warming up inside your house, it's also warming up your heart, and you simply cannot stop yourself from keeping it. Or maybe it happens like this. Simply. You come home one day to an itty bitty kitten sleeping inside of your sneaker, and just like that, you get adopted.  Yes, this story is simple, but it might be one of the cutest that we have come across in a long time, because not only did this kitten get adopted by its human of choice, the human also got a best friend for life. Really, more stories like these in 2025 is all that we ask for. Stories of wholesomeness and cats and kindness.",

We're starting off chonky tuesdays with an absolute unit of an orange cat who is particularly peeved about being replaced as the baby of the family. We all treat our cats like babies. It's part of being a pawrent. However, when you have an actual hooman baby, it's easy for the cat to feel replaced as the center of attention. Now, some cats adjust to this quite well, becoming beautiful babysitters to their new hooman siblings and becoming a heartwarming duo of feline family love.Others, on the other hand, get jealous of the new hooman in the house. And when they do, it's beyond hilarious. Our orange cat in today's post loves to let his pawrents know how hissterically grumpy he is about his new sibling, but luckily, we think it's all for show. This clementine-colored chonker below is waiting for your giggles with his family of hooman gingers. We wish you a very chonky and humorous day!",

    "description": "When it comes to booking a hotel, it's a good idea to go online and read some recent reviews before deciding to rest your head there. The more recent, the better! Guests will be quite honest in their reviews, and they'll note important things like if the beds were lumpy, if the continental breakfast was just granola bars and water bottles, or if the reception staff were impolite. Take it with a grain of salt, because people do love to yap on about their every little perceived slight. If someone writes that the front desk person looked at them funny, you can overlook their review. But if a different person says that there were bugs or water damage in the room, it's time to search elsewhere. Alongside all of the issues below, one of the most infuriating vacation nightmares is if your hotel room is so bad that you have to sleep in your car. You won't get a refund, no matter how much you complain to the receptionist. This has happened to me only once, and the hotel had the scratchiest sheets imaginable. Instead of dozing off into a deep slumber, the bed lumps felt like I was laying on baseballs. The carpet was moist, and the shower was just a drizzle of water. That's what I get for picking a 2-star hotel in the middle of nowhere, I suppose. After that, read about some employees whose bosses had great reasons for letting them go, like one worker who \"pick[ed] up his car with a forklift.\"",

    "description": "The fallout that comes after the holidays is always challenging, especially after spending time with difficult family members. Not only do you need to get yourself back into a routine before returning to work, but you also often need some space to recharge and recenter yourself after having virtually no time to yourself during the week of Christmas.Don't get me wrong, it's lovely to spend the holidays with your parents as a fully grown adult. Sometimes, you get to revert back to being a kid for a few days, but that comes with its disadvantages as well. Now that you are a fully grown adult yourself, it's nearly impossible to ignore all the ways in which your parents' way of life is unhealthy, ridiculous, or just straight-up aggravating. Here, we have a 38-year-old woman who just hosted her mother for the week of Christmas at her place, since she lived closer to where the whole family gathered for the holiday. However, after the mother's basement flooded, the 68-year-old woman wanted to extend her stay for the following week. In theory, this is justified and understandable, but we trust the Redditor that her needy mother was using potentially minor damage as an excuse to stick around.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for some commentary from yours truly.
