    "description": "Jason was investigating a bug in a bitmask. It should have been set to 0b11, but someone had set it to just plain decimal 11. The line responsible looked like this: byte number = (byte) 11; This code takes the decimal number 11, casts it to a byte, and stores it in a byte, leaving us with the decimal number 11. Curious, Jason checked the blame and saw that one of their senior-most devs was responsible. Figuring this was a good opportunity to poke a little fun at the dev for a silly mistake like this, Jason sent them a message about the difficulties of telling apart decimal values and binary values when the decimal value only contained ones and zeroes. \"What are you talking about?\" the dev replied back. \"The (byte) operator tells the compiler that the number is in binary.\" Concerned by that reply, Jason started checking the rest of the code. And sure enough, many places in the code, the senior dev had followed this convention. Many of them were wrong, and just hadn't turned into a bug yet. One of two were coincidentally setting the important bits anyway. Now, in a vague \"defense\" of what the senior dev was trying to do, C doesn't have a standard way of specifying binary literals. GCC and Clang both have a non-standard extension which lets you do 0b11, but that's not standard. So I understand the instinct- \"there should be an easy way to do this,\" even if anyone with more than a week's experience *should have known better*. But the real moral of the story is: don't use bitmasks without also using constants. It never should have been written with literals, it should have been written as byte number = FLAG_A | FLAG_B. The #define for the flags could be integer constants, or if you're feeling spicy about it, bitshift operations: #define FLAG_A = (1 \u003c\u003c 1). Then you don't need binary literals, and also your code is actually readable for humans. It was difficult to track down all the places where this misguided convention for binary literals was followed, as it was hard to tell the difference between that and a legitimate cast to byte. Fortunately, there weren't that many places where bitmasks were getting set. [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.

    "description": "...to know which way the wind blows. This week, it's been an ill one. Two of our readers sent us references to the BBC's reports on unusual weather in Bristol - one from the web, and one mobile. Maybe that will help you deduce the source of this error. Frist, Graham F. shared a screenshot of the beeb's mobile app, bellowing \"I know Milton is hitting the US hard right now but that's nothing compared to the 14,000 mph winds here!\"   Snecod, Jeremy P. confirms the story and provides some details from the web page. \"BBC weather is clipping windspeed making it look like it's only 5909mph and not 15909mph... At least they realise something is wrong.\"   Some anonymous American shared a snap of their weather station, which was worth a little chuckle. \"Whether you like it or not, it's the weather, sort of. And, no, this wasn't during the recent eclipse.\" It would have been worse if the crescent had been a \"sunny and clear\" icon, though, given the time of day that the snap was taken. All in all, I have to call this \"not an error'd\".   We had to dig into the surplus bin to pad out the theme with this pair from Stuart H. He opens with \"I can only assume that the forecast is for Hell or a point between the surface and the center of the Sun! I think I need to turn the aircon up a few notches.\"   \"And following on from the forecast on the front-page - it's even worse for the rest of the world!\"   Finally Eric K. reported a temperature extreme \"Hellfire or extinguished sun? My weather app seems unsure of which type of apocalyptic weather conditions we're currently experiencing.\" But I also note this represents an unusually high level of humidity. I haven't checked but maybe one of our readers will look up these coordinates and let us know which burg has been obliterated.",

    "description": "Don't you sometimes wish you could say whatever you want to your boss, without thinking of the repercussions? Perhaps we could come up with a workplace 'purge day', in which everyone could do and say whatever they wanted at work, and then all will be forgotten the next day. Some employees don't need a day like that, as they are not afraid to put people in their place, even their bosses. Take the employee in this Reddit story for example. If I were told by my boss that I have to accept a $1 raise, while being forced to take on twice the workload, I would probably agree without a fight. However, this employee did not let their boss bully them into accepting these terrible terms and even threatened to contact their lawyer when their boss wouldn't let it go.Keep scrolling to read about the boss' reaction to being put in his place by his employee.

Some folks wondered if they even alternate or if the employee is always doing the boss's bidding. The two share an office, and one day, the boss made a snide remark about the smell of the employee's sandwich his wife made him for lunch. When the employee got up from his desk mid-meal to handle a work-related matter quickly. the boss proceeded to toss the rest of the sandwich in the trash without asking. The employee returned to his desk, figured out what happened, and hatched a plan for some petty payback. Let's just say the office was smelling only of this sandwich for the rest of the day.For more stories like this, take a look at this post about some HOA drama!",

For some reason, people think that black cats are bad luck, when in reality, anyone who has ever owned a black cat will be able to tell you that it is so, so not true. Black cats are just as purrfect as any other cat. In fact, black cats are actually magic. They are full of beautiful dark magic that we cannot fully comprehend. Black cats are goofy voids. Black cats are beautiful, even though they generally look like blobs of black in the pictures that we take of them. Our cameras simply cannot capture everything that they are. It is too much for our lacking technology to handle. That is not the cats' fault. And so, we have to fix that reputation that they have, and what is a better time to do it than Spooktober?",

But even then, way back when there were no domesticated fluffy felines in existence, we can say that cats love story with food started as early as a hooman handed a piece of food to a feline. Our dear domesticated fluffy friends just love food, and it's quite apparent.If you're a cat pawrent, you know what we're talking about. Cats will monch on anything, but they will also not be satisfied if the food is not exactly to their taste. Cats produce chonkers which are absolute units because cats love food so much. If you're not just a cat pawrent, but a cat pawrent of a true chonker, you probably deal with it all the time.These foodie feline memes below capture the cattitude towards food, and simply the unbroken connection between our fluffy feline friends and fresh food.",
