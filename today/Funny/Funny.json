    "description": "When I was growing up, presents from my parents each said \"From: Mom and Dad.\" Now, from a young age, there was no doubt in my mind or secret kept that my mother was the one who had actually gone out and purchased each gift (with some exceptions, of course), but that didn't mean that my father had any less to do with it. No one's relationship is perfect—as no two people themselves are perfect—but their relationship had an equal contribution that they both worked hard at… and, so, both their names went on the gift. I don't have kids of my own—yet—so parents feel free to stop me here, but I couldn't imagine doing it any differently.Don't get me wrong here, and I know that the gifts weren't specifically for children, but the issue seems to be larger than the presents themselves and seems to be speaking more to the space of equal contribution and following through on doing the things that you say you're going to do. But, taking a petty stance and putting only your name on the gifts you bought when going to a family is just airing your dirty laundry out for everyone to see and—well, if you've been around family ever in your life, that's a can of worms you're better not opening.",

    "description": "Don't worry, the season of work holiday parties is almost over. But with them have come some seriously juicy coworker drama that we get to unpack. Work parties typically boast about free food, questionable dance moves from upper management, and—if you're lucky—a holiday gift worth bragging about. But every now and then, someone shows up with an agenda. Like this entitled coworker who treats the holiday party like a personal shopping spree.In most workplaces, gift exchanges are a lighthearted affair. You cross your fingers, hope for a decent gift card or maybe some yummy Christmas cookies, and call it a day. Well, this office decided to do a raffle instead of the traditional gift exchange. And for one newlywed coworker, this party wasn't about holiday cheer. It was about recouping wedding costs. After spending months talking about her extravagant destination wedding (complete with a cash donation option instead of a registry), she arrived at the party ready to stake her claim on the biggest prizes.",

It feels like we have been waiting for an entire year for this merry day to come again, like every hurdle we have passed led us a little closer to this beautiful, meowgical, purrfect day. And now, we're here. Finally. The morning after, and the first thing that we want to do - no, the first thing that we need to do… is start our morning with some purrfectly cheerful cat memes. Because hey, even Christmas morning has to start on the right paw, and some funny cat memes first thing are the best way to do it. In this sense, Christmas morning is no different. Silly cat memes like these kept us going while we waited for this day to come, and they will keep helping us thrive in the new year as well. So, enjoy these memes, friends, and happy holidays!",

    "description": "This story, we think, is a real Christmas miracle. A boy saved a kitten that was being harmed by a bunch of other kids by trading his skateboard for it. That's amazing. That is something that does not happen every day, and both he and the parents who raised him deserve all the praise in the world. But that's not the miracle. It's not the kitten getting rescued, not really. Of course, that's a miracle in and of itself, but the real miracle here is the kid and all the hope that he had given us for the world right in time for Christmas.It's not every day that we see someone being so kind to an animal - selflessly putting the animal first, rescuing the kitten and not caring about his toy being taken from him. In fact, we see the opposite much more often. So, on Christmas morning, it's only right to focus on the good things, and this… this might be one of the best, most uplifting things to happen all year long.",

    "description": "Last year, we spent our Christmas looking at some Christmas movies and specials, and rated them based on the accuracy of their portrayal of the IT industry. We're going to continue with that this year. Just like last year, we'll rate things based on a number of floppy disks- 💾💾💾💾💾 means it's as accurate as Office Space, whereas 💾 puts it someplace down around Superman III. Gremlins Technology has conquered the world, but none of it actually works. As Mr. Futterman (played by the classic character actor Dick Miller) points out: they've all got gremlins in them. Except, thanks to a goofy dad's last minute Christmas gift and some careless 80s teens, the gremlins aren't just taking over technology, but the entire town with their goofy violence. This was the most mentioned film left out last year. As far as tech industry representation, we've got a lot to discuss here. First, the father who purchases Gizmo- the Mogwai that becomes the source of all the gremlins- is an inventor. This is the 80s, and thus we're all recovering from the fads of Rubik's Cubes and Pet Rocks, so Randy Petlzer is trying to crash whatever the next fad is. He's got a collection of goofy gadgets, including the orange juicer above, which is itself a premonition of the Juicero startup, itself a goofy disaster of venture capital. An independent inventor with no real business model but a bunch of goofy ideas also thinks he's a genius. Where have I heard that before? At least, he did \"read the manual\" (listened to the instructions given to him by the very 80s orientalist stereotype) and even communicated them, so credit to that. But nobody actually followed those instructions anyway, which leads to all the chaos. Do you think I used the word \"goofy\" enough to describe this movie? It's very goofy, and I think it's gotten goofier with age, honestly. Without nostalgia, I wouldn't call it good, but it is goofy. The highlight of the film is Phoebe Cates's monologue about why she hates Christmas: a grisly tale about her father's death. Rating: 💾 The Apartment Bud Baxter has an apartment conveniently close to work- so convenient that all the executives at his company bring their mistresses there. It's great for Bud's career, but less good for his reputation and his own personal love life. So, this may be a stretch as Christmas movies go. It takes place around Christmas, but doesn't have a lot of Christmas themes. You know what it does have? A load of entitled management types who not only control Bud's life around the office, but his life at home, and definitely don't care about how that affects him. If this were in 2024, they'd be using bossware to track him and smart door locks to keep him out of his own house. Rating: 💾💾💾 The Knight Before Christmas A modern gal in Ohio has given up on love. A 14th century knight is magically transported to Ohio. Together, they discover the true meaning of Christmas- and love. This is Netflix's stab at a Hallmark level Christmas movie. The whole thing revolves around the Ohio town having a Christmas tradition of erecting a \"Christmas Castle\" and doing a pseudo-Ren Faire thing every Christmas which is not, as far as I know, a thing anywhere, except perhaps a few small towns in Europe, where they have naturally occurring castles. Our gallant knight gets to be flummoxed by modern technology, like the Alexa, but basically figures all this stuff out over the course of a few days. For IT accuracy, this is definitely: Rating: 💾 However, it's also worth noting that the plot kicks off with our modern gal hitting the befuddled knight with her car at the Christmas Castle. They go to the hospital, where everyone assumes he's an actor from the Castle, and now has amnesia after being hit by a car. Since he has no ID, instead of providing medical care for what they believe to be severe brain damage, they just… let her take him home with her. So, if we were rating this for accurately representing the health care system in the US: Rating: 💉💉💉💉💉 The Bear: Feast of the Seven Fishes \"The Bear\" focuses on Carmy, who is trying to turn his deceased brother's sandwich shop into a Michelin rated fine-dining restaurant. This episode flashes back to a Christmas before his brother died, and shows us what his family life was like, as his mother prepares the traditional \"Feast of the Seven Fishes\" for Christmas. So, unlike Christmas Castles, Feasts of Seven Fishes are real. I grew up with the loud Italian family. My grandmother was so Italian she came through Ellis Island and also had one of these to point at her Christmas Tree. We did not do the complete Feast of the Seven Fishes, because nobody wanted to work that hard, but deep fried kippers were always featured. These were whole fish, which you'd eat. Bones, faces and all. That was fine, but I was honestly really there for the ginettes (everyone else calls them anise cookies, but we called them ginettes). Our Christmas wasn't as stressful as Carmy's, and while folks got drunk, it was strictly \"the old guys drink too much and fall asleep in their chairs\" levels of drunk. Rating: 🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝 Dominic the Donkey When Santa wants to visit his \"paisans\" in Italy, his reindeer can't handle the hills- so he relies on his friend, Dominic, the Italian Christmas Donkey. Look, I had to suffer through this song growing up, so now you do to. Hit play. Put it on loop. You're trapped in here with us. Jingety jing! HEE HAW HEE HAW! IT'S DOMINIC THE DONKEY.

Meanwhile 1950s Fox Mulder tries to track down the \"monster\" and put a stop to the Communist threat it represents. I know what you're saying: \"there's nothing Christmas here!\" But, based on this list so far, amnesia is a Christmas tradition! Setting that aside, I'm not religious, but if we're talking about keeping the \"Christ\" in \"Christmas\", you can't do better than a giant robot who dies for our sins and is reborn days later. Honestly, the Bible could have used more giant robots. Maybe a Godzilla or two. While the movie leans hard into Superman as its metaphor for heroism, Superman has frequently been appropriated as a Christ metaphor. Which, there's a whole lot to unpack there, given that Superman's creators were Jewish. This story features incompetent government agents trying to regulate technology they don't understand. While the film colors it in with Red Scare tones, it echoes the same constant shrieking from the FBI and NSA that regular citizens shouldn't have access to strong encryption (and they need a magical backdoor into all encryption algorithms to keep you SAFE). Or the countless \"think of the children!\" bills that attempt to police the Internet and always fail. Or the classic \"Felony Contempt of Business Model\"- the sections of the DMCA that make it illegal for you to refill your printer cartridges or jailbreak your phones.

    "description": "Mihail was excited when, many years ago, he was invited to work for a local company. At the time, he was in college, so getting real-world experience (and a real-world paycheck) sounded great. It was a small company, with only a handful of developers. The excitement didn't last long, as Mihail quickly learned what the project was: parsing commit messages in source control and generating a report of how many hours a developer worked on any given task. It was a timesheet tracking application, but built on commit messages. \"This… seems like a bad idea?\" Mihail told his supervisor. \"Couldn't we just do this in a timesheet tool? Or heck, a spreadsheet? Accounting would probably prefer a spreadsheet.\" \"If we did that, people could edit their numbers,\" the supervisor responded. Apparently they hadn't heard about amending commits. Or just… lying in the commit message? Now, Mihail wasn't allowed to start working. A design document needed to be crafted first. So several senior developers went into a room, and hammered out the design. Three weeks later, they had a basic structure of five classes: components, which were made up of milestones, which were made up of tickets, which had contributors, which made commits. It wasn't a complicated design, so it was mystifying as to why it took three weeks to write. More problematic- the project had only budgeted a month, so Mihail was left with a single week for implementation. One frantic week later, Mihail handed in his work. It was insufficiently tested, but more or less worked according to the design. He had to take a week off of work for exams, and when he returned from those exams, the senior devs had some good news and bad news. The good news: they were happy with his work! The bad news: during the week the design had been completely changed and needed to be rewritten. So the rewrite began, with a new design, and once again, too little time left to do the work. Tests went out the window first, but \"basic coding practices\" quickly followed. The second version was less reliable and usable than the first. Then the Big Boss sent down an edict: this whole system should get its data from their bug tracker, which had SQL integration options. Once again, it was all thrown away, and a new version began. Mihail started writing queries for the database, starting by joining the three key tables to produce the data they wanted. Then he read the new version of the design doc, published while he was working, and joined the five tables together they'd need. After combining the six tables the design doc called for, Mihail was starting to think the code he was writing was bad. The workflow that the design called for offered it's own challenges. After writing the query which joined eight tables together, with a nest of subqueries and summaries, the query itself weighed in at 2,000kb. And that was just for one report- there were a dozen reports that were part of the project, all similarly messy, and all subject to rapidly changing design documents. The queries were all hard-coded directly in a Python script, and the design was explicit: don't slow down developers by using prepared statements, just use string concatenation (aka SQL injection) because we can trust our inputs! This Python script would run its reporting queries, and then dump the results into tables in the application's database. Then a web UI would pick up the data from the tables and show it to the user. The only thing we can say about the results is that the web UI looked nice. The underlying horror that was the code was hidden. With the project finally done, it was time to show it off to upper management. Mihail's supervisor starts demoing their system, and after a minute, the Big Boss pipes up: \"Why do we need this?\" \"Oh, well, it's a more flexible-\" \"No. Why do we need this?\" \"Time tracking is fundamental to our billing-\" \"Right, but why do we need this? You know what, never mind. Do whatever you want with this, just make sure that all the data ends up in an Excel spreadsheet at the end of the month. That's what we send to accounting.\" All in all, Mihail spent six months working on this project. Once complete, it was never used by anyone.
