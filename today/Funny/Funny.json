    "description": "Many parents have to beg their children to pick up a book, but some have the exact opposite issue: They can't get their kids to stop reading! When you get really into reading as a child, you want to read all the time. Whether you're reading under the table at dinner time, or sneaking a flashlight into your room to read under the covers, you'll find any scrap of time to read. It's addicting to be engrossed in a fascinating mystery or a horror book. It's also a lot better than playing endless video games or spending an entire day on an iPad. The kids are enriching their own knowledge and growing their vocabulary. In contrast, some parents cannot get their kids to read at all. Their kids will just throw the books down in frustration, or give up before they get a chapter in. It's like pulling teeth! So having a kid who loves to bury their head in a book is usually seen as a good thing. But one grandma is butting heads with her daughter-in-law over her daughter's reading habits. Grandma thinks she's reading too much during a beach vacation! Luckily for this little girl, her family had her back. Up next, read about the neighbors who kept disagreeing over their shared fence, with one frustrated dude saying, \"[My] neighbor was petty... I'm going to make him replace his whole fence.\"",

    "description": "It's hard to be on the receiving end of questionable parenting habits. When your mom or dad is being ridiculous, frustrating, or just all-around crazy, calling them out on their nonsense does not always help the situation get any better. These Redditors understand that conundrum all too well.Some of these frustrating parenting habits can range from universally annoying ticks to uncharacteristically specific quirks and eccentricities. For instance, we've got plenty of folks discussing their parents' tendencies to speak out of turn or share privileged information with other family members. That's on the more common side of habits. So is the scenario when your parents call your name from another room and then never tell you what they need from you when you respond. However, your dad calling you by a different one of his sibling's names and never apologizing for the mistake is not exactly a classic parenting lapse in judgment.Keep scrolling below for 20 of the most annoying parenting habits.

Well, you can keep telling yourself that lie as much as you want, but we all know that when another cat comes pouncing into your life (whether through the choice of the wholesome cat distribution system) or because you just happened to stumble into a shelter, you take the cat home. We don't make the rules, we just follow them. Take it up with Ceiling Cat if you have any complaints.Well, after promising her partner she wouldn't get any more cats, one cat mom happened to find herself in an animal shelter and came across the sweetest, snuggliest, most awwdorable brown kitten you ever saw. So naturally, she took the cat home. And you know what? Since she took the cat child home, they haven't slept apart for even one night. You can't be mad when it's true love, right? So go ahead, keep telling yourself that this one is the last one, but we all know you'll purrfectly open your heart to another cat when the time is right.",

    "description": "Getting out of bed when it's so cold outside is hard. So hard. We love autumn and winter, but we have to admit that even to people who like cold as much as we do, it's tough to get out of bed in the mornings when the blankets are so nice and warm. Five more minutes in bed. That's all that we want in the morning - every morning, but especially when it's cold like this. But the clock doesn't stop ticking, and we do have to get to work on time, so we supposed that we just have to satisfy ourselves with the next best thing, which is a whole bunch of silly cat memes. Don't doubt us. Believe us when we say that funny cat memes feel like staying in bed for five more minutes, because sleepily scrolling and giggling at cat memes is what we would be doing anyway if we did have those extra five minutes in bed. So, look around, make sure that your boss is not behind you, and enjoy these hissterical memes.",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/plugin-acrobatics",
    "description": "Once upon a time, web browsers weren't the one-stop-shop for all kinds of possible content that they are today. Aside from the most basic media types, your browser depended on content plugins to display different media types. Yes, there was an era where, if you wanted to watch a video in a web browser, you may need to have QuickTime or… (shudder) Real Player installed. As a web developer, you'd need to write code to check which plugins were installed. If they don't have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed, there's no point in serving them up a PDF file- you'll need instead to give them an install link. Which brings us to Ido's submission. This code is intended to find the Acrobat Reader plugin version. acrobatVersion: function GetAcrobatVersion() { // Check acrobat is Enabled or not and its version acrobatVersion = 0; if (navigator.plugins \u0026\u0026 navigator.plugins.length) { for (intLoop = 0; intLoop \u003c= 15; intLoop++) { if (navigator.plugins[intLoop] != -1) { acrobatVersion = parseFloat(navigator.plugins[intLoop].version); isAcrobatInstalled = true; break; } } } else {...} } So, we start by checking for the navigator.plugins array. This is a wildly outdated thing to do, as the MDN is quite emphatic about, but I'm not going to to get hung up on that- this code is likely old. But what I do want to pay attention to is that they check navigator.plugins.length. Then they loop across the set of plugins using a for loop. And don't use the length! They bound the loop at 15, arbitrarily. Why? No idea- I suspect it's for the same reason they named the variable intLoop and not i like a normal human. Then they check to ensure that the entry at plugins[intLoop] is not equal to -1. I'm not sure what the expected behavior was here- if you're accessing an array out of bounds in JavaScript, I'd expect it to return undefined. Perhaps some antique version of Internet Explorer did something differently? Sadly plausible. Okay, we've found something we believe to be a plugin, because it's not -1, we'll grab the version property off of it and… parseFloat. On a version number. Which ignores the fact that 1.1 and 1.10 are different versions. Version numbers, like phone numbers, are not actually numbers. We don't do arithmetic on them, treat them like text. That done, we can say isAcrobatInstalled is true- despite the fact that we didn't check to see if this plugin was actually an Acrobat plugin. It could have been Flash. Or QuickTime. Then we break out of the loop. A loop that, I strongly suspect, would only ever have one iteration, because undefined != -1. So there we have it: code that doesn't do what it intends to, and even if it did, is doing it the absolute wrong way, and is also epically deprecated.

    "description": "Sometimes, there's code so bad you simply know it's unused and never called. Bernard sends us one such method, in Java: /** * Finds a GroupEntity by group number. * * @param group the group number. * @return the GroupEntity object. */ public static GroupEntity find(String group) { return GroupEntity.find(group); } This is a static method on the GroupEntity class called find, which calls a static method on the GroupEntity class called find, which calls a static method on the GroupEntity class called find and it goes on and on my friend. Clearly, this is a mistake. Bernard didn't supply much more context, so perhaps the String was supposed to be turned into some other type, and there's an overload which would break the recursion. Regardless, there was an antediluvian ticket on the backlog requesting that the feature to allow finding groups via a search input that no one had yet worked on. I'm sure they'll get around to it, once the first call finishes. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
