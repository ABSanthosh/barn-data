    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/while-this-works",
    "description": "Rob's co-worker needed to write a loop that iterated across every element in an array. This very common problem, and you'd imagine that a developer would use one of the many common solutions to this problem. The language, in this case, is JavaScript, which has many possible options for iterating across an array. Perhaps that buffet of possible options was too daunting. Perhaps the developer thought to themselves, \"a for each loop is easy mode, I'm a 10x programmer, and I want a 10x solution!\" Or perhaps they just didn't know what the hell they were doing. Regardless of why, this is the result: try { var index = 0; while (true) { var nextItem = someArray[index]; doSomethingWithItem(nextItem); index++; } } catch (e) { } This code iterates across the array in an infinite while loop, passing each item to doSomethingWithItem. Eventually, they hit the end of the array, and someArray[index] starts returning undefined. Somewhere, deep in doSomethingWithItem, that causes an exception to be thrown. That is how we break out of the loop- eventually something chokes on an undefined value, which lets us know there's nothing left in the array. Which puts us in an interesting position- if anyone decided to add better error handling to doSomethingWithItem, the entire application could break, and it wouldn't be obvious why. This is a peak example of \"every change breaks somebody's workflow\", but specifically because that workflow is stupid. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time.

    "description": "Alice has the dubious pleasure of working with SalesForce. Management wants to make sure that any code is well tested, so they've set a requirement that all deployed code needs 75% code coverage. Unfortunately, properly configuring a code coverage tool is too hard, so someone came up with a delightful solution: just count how many lines are in your tests and how many lines are in your code, and make sure that your tests make up 75% of the total codebase. Given those metrics, someone added this test: public void testThis() { int i = 0; i++; i++; i++; i++; i++; // snip 35,990 lines i++; i++; i++; i++; } Keep adding lines, and you could easily get close to 100% code coverage, this way. Heck, if you get close enough to round up, it'll look like 100% code coverage. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.

    "description": "Is it just a thing that hospitals must have the most inaccessible parking around?I'll never forget the irony of having to walk (hobble) 10 minutes down the road and across the adjacent park and across the adjacent park on my freshly broken ankle away from the local hospital where there was the closest parking available. And, of course, this was in the early hours of the morning after waiting 8 hours in the emergency department and in the not-so-nice part of town.To make matters even worse, you'd have to imagine that the staff of the hospital were doing the same thing I had to do daily, meaning that nursing and support staff getting off early shifts were walking through the dark, unlit park and side streets alone in the early hours to get to their vehicles.So, in a way, you can understand the need for this hospital's staff to find closer parking, but doing so at the expense of a local family-run business is not the way to do it… making this story just another example of the extreme lengths people will go to in order to secure parking for their vehicles.",

    "description": "This worker has been dealing with a stage-5 clinger who's now escalating things even further. Workplace friendships can be hard to navigate at times. When you're spending 40+ hours each week with the same people, you tend to get to know them on a personal level as well as just talking about job stuff. You might get the insider scoop on one coworker's marriage drama, or maybe you'll learn about another person's ongoing feud with their neighbor next door. You probably know a ton of information about your work bestie's spouse, even if you've literally never met that spouse. You can easily get enmeshed in people's lives, and it makes the work week go by faster. However, a good percentage of people only come to the workplace to do their work and then head home. For whatever reason, they're focused on their job. With this type of coworker, no matter how badly you want to be friends, you'll get strongly rejected. And, as this person explained in their own story about a coworker being too friendly, sometimes HR needs to get involved to settle things in a way that works for both colleagues. Next, read about the reasons these CEOs ran their companies into the ground, like one boss who realized that \"Almost 3/4 of the employees had quit by this point because paychecks kept bouncing.\"",

You won't wear the cute sweaters that Grandma gave you.

In fact, we should put you on top of the tree as the star because you're just daddy's purrfect little angel, aren't you?You know what? Cats and Christmas go together like us and chocolate cake - we just love it so much that we can't control ourselves around it. We don't knock over whole chocolate cakes whenever we see them, though, so that is one main difference.

    "description": "I am home recovering from an incredible PAX Unplugged. I love the show but I always need a few days afterwards to hibernate and recharge my batteries. This Unplugged was especially cool because it was just me and my youngest son Noah. He’s 14 now and as a Dad it was just an incredible opportunity to get to spend the entire weekend with him. We spent time roaming the massive expo floor, watching folks play games in the freeplay area and trading pins at the community events every day. I also took great pleasure in introducing him to the magic that is Reading Terminal and its culinary delights.",

    "description": "I am a sucker for demos at PAX; I'm also too polite to extract myself after a certain point, even if the theme or mechanics don't particularly entice. Oh! And try not to be disgusted overmuch by the greasy and wicked levitator floating in Panel 2. This vile beast, the Cheesesteak Fairy, earned more than ten gees for Child's Play if you can believe it. The ritual involves holding the mascot hostage until the audience ponies up, and thus far this mercenary tendency has served the teens very well.",
