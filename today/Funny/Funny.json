    "description": "The bond between a hooman and their favorite cat will never break, even if that kitty is not actually yours. Finding a stray on the street is always a heartbreaking experience for a cat lover. Desperately skinny, meowing for help, and likely covered in indignant clouds of dirt, outdoor cats cling to the nearest hooman servant, hoping for a cuddle, a pet, or even a tin of tuna to aid their kitty quest. But not every cat out there is on some kind of quest; in fact, many cats simply get lost, hoping to find their way home somehow. But when you're sharing a brain cell with your other kitty brethren, finding home all by your lonesome isn't so easy. So when this kind hooman found a lost cat out in the wild, she gleefully brought it under her wing. However, less than 24 hours later, and after sleeping on the bathroom floor with her new favorite cat, the original owner was found. What's a cat lover to do? Well, the \"right thing,\" of course.",

    "description": "Hey there, pawrents of the internet. We know you know how lucky you are, but it never hurts to be reminded. We get to experience the meowgical beings that are cats literally every day - we get to cuddle with them, see them as they make adorable airplane ears, and simply bask in their cat-like glory. Not only that, but having deemed ourselves worthy of their love, we get to be loved by them. And that, dear friends, is the greatest gift of all.There is no love like a cat's love. Dogs love everyone and they aren't afraid to show it. Cats are picky about the hoomans they love, and once you're chosen, you're chosen for life. Sure, they might get a little grumpy if you feed them late too many times, but they will be yours furever despite it all. We found a heartwarming helping of lovestruck felines that we just had to share with you, to remind you how lucky we are to be so loved by our cat companions. Enjoy!",

Can you imagine how bad the idea must be if your lawyer is asking you not to pay them to do it?Besides, commenters are right, this isn't about him or his ex-wife as much as it is about the children, and he has a wrong of things by thinking that a \"show of strength\" might benefit him in some way. It's more likely that a \"show of strength\" might actually even lead the court to think that he has more financial wealth than the brother was leading on originally, and might actually make things worse for him overall.",

    "description": "The tipping debate continues on: some servers love working for tips, while others wish they had a much higher hourly wage instead. There's a certain type of customer who loves to complain about tipping culture to the waiters themselves (and anyone else who will listen!). They are usually grumpy already, so nothing to the waiter says to them will permeate their brains. This customer shows up grumpy, not just because they're hangry, but because they're bitter that they have to tip. Many non-tippers are seemingly ashamed of their habit. It is a faux pas to just not tip your server at all, and if you do it in front of people, they'll probably give you a side-eye. Perhaps the worst thing you could do is inform your server that you're not tipping before you even get your food. Why would you want to insult the person responsible for your impending dinner? It's a terrible idea, but for that customer who's eager to complain, it's just a common-sense thing to do. They just don't have any empathy for their waiters, and they look down on them, which gives them a reason to avoid shelling out extra cash for a tip. Up next, read about the entitled mother of 12-14 year old tweens who demanded that an airline passenger move to a middle seat: 'This is about needing to sit next to my kids.'",

    "description": "DZ's tech lead is a doctor of computer science, and that doctor loves to write code. But you already know that \"PhD\" stands for \"Piled high and deep\", and that's true of the tech lead's clue. For example, in C#: private List ExtractListForId(string id) { List list = new List(); lock (this) { var items = _foos.Where(f =\u003e f.Id == id).ToList(); foreach (var item in items) { list.Add(item); } } return list; } The purpose of this function is to find all the elements in a list where they have a matching ID. That's accomplished in one line: _foo.Where(f =\u003e f.Id == id). For some reason, the function goes through the extra step of iterating across the returned list and constructing a new one. There's no real good reason for this, though it does force LINQ to be eager- by default, the Where expression won't be evaluated until you check the results. The lock is in there for thread safety, which hey- the enumerator returned by Where is not threadsafe, so that's not a useless thing to do there. But it's that lock which hints at the deeper WTF here: our PhD-having-tech-lead knows that adding threads ensures you're using more of the CPU, and they've thrown threads all over the place without any real sense to it. There's no clear data ownership of any given thread, which means everything is locked to hell and back, the whole thing frequently deadlocks, and it's impossible to debug. It's taken days for DZ to get this much of a picture of what's going on in the code, and further untangling of this multithreaded pile of spaghetti is going to take many, many more days- and much, much more of DZ's sanity.

    "description": "It takes a lot of time and effort to build a code base that exceeds 100kloc. Rome wasn't built in a day; it just burned down in one. Liza was working in a Python shop. They had a mildly successful product that ran on Linux. The sales team wanted better sales software to help them out, and instead of buying something off the shelf, they hired a C# developer to make something entirely custom. Within a few months, that developer had produced a codebase of 320kloc I say \"produced\" and not \"wrote\" because who knows how much of it was copy/pasted, stolen from Stack Overflow, or otherwise not the developer's own work. You have to wonder, how do you get such a large codebase so quickly? private String getDatum() { DateTime datum = new DateTime(); datum = DateTime.Now; return datum.ToShortDateString(); } public int getTag() { int tag; DateTime datum = new DateTime(); datum = DateTime.Today; tag = datum.Day; return tag; } private int getMonat() { int monat; DateTime datum = new DateTime(); datum = DateTime.Today; monat = datum.Month; return monat; } private int getJahr() { int monat; DateTime datum = new DateTime(); datum = DateTime.Today; monat = datum.Year; return monat; } private int getStunde() { int monat; DateTime datum = new DateTime(); datum = DateTime.Now; monat = datum.Hour; return monat; } private int getMinute() { int monat; DateTime datum = new DateTime(); datum = DateTime.Now; monat = datum.Minute; return monat; } Instead of our traditional \"bad date handling code\" which eschews the built-in libraries, this just wraps the built in libraries with a less useful set of wrappers. Each of these could be replaced with some version of DateTime.Now.Minute. You'll notice that most of the methods are private, but one is public. That seems strange, doesn't it? Well this set of methods was pulled from one random class which implements them in the codebase, but many classes have these methods copy/pasted in. At some point, the developer realized that duplicating that much code was a bad idea, and started marking them as public, so that you could just call them as needed. Note, said developer never learned to use the keyword static, so you end up calling the method on whatever random instance of whatever random class you happen to have handy. The idea of putting it into a common base class, or dedicated date-time utility class never occurred to the developer, but I guess that's because they were already part of a dedicated date-time utility class.
