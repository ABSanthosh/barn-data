    "description": "Having the option to work overtime in your workplace can be a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, allowing you to work more than you're required and earn more money in return can be a lifesaver for many people. Those extra bucks can really make all the difference. You don't have to, but you can, so having that option as a last resort might ease many people's minds.On the other hand, that option can seriously mess with some employees' work-life balance. If one is given unlimited overtime options, what is stopping them from working so much that they barely get to see their homes? If it means more money, some people might not want to give that up. Who knows what it will take to get them to take a break?Regardless, the one thing that we can know for sure, is that if the overtime option exists, the only ones who should decide what to do with it are those who end up working those hours. Which cannot really be said about the story below…",

    "description": "\"Get off of my lawn.\"Most of us have probably heard that phrase uttered, either through popular culture or something similar in real life. But we probably never thought that we'd grow up to become that person. Yet, and still, we drift through the sands of time; we find ourselves changed, and whereas we were once the kid playing on the neighborhood streets—occasionally ending up on the neighbor's front yard, suddenly we're that neighbor and are vigorously defending our grass from the young whippersnappers traipsing upon it.Let's be honest, there's a little more going on here than the simple trampling of grass. I'm pretty sure even the most lenient among us would draw the line somewhere around the point where digging starts. Even if you didn't care about the state of your property, digging can be dangerous thanks to things like buried cables, and there starts to become a large degree of liability to consider.At the end of the day, it's his property and he can ask his neighbors to stay the heck off it if he wants to, even in lesser circumstances, and the neighbors need to respect that and step in and parent their child.",

    "description": "Cats are such a hypnotic animal as it is - you can stare at a kitty cat for hours on end without getting bored, because cats are so interesting as they are. But add to that a unique fluffy fur pattern, and you get a meowsmerising result. Cats with interesting fur patterns are so beautiful to look at, it's like a hypnosis - you cannot look away. It's a special combination of cats' cuteness and how beautiful they are.We're firm believers that all cats are beautiful. It doesn't matter if a cat isn't \"conventionally\" beautiful - all cats have beautiful souls, and that's more than enough to make them the best animals ever. But the thought of adding to that a truly mesmerising and beautiful feline fur pattern, and you receive cats that you cannot take your eyes off of.Now, combine that with the fact that cat memes are the best memes (because they contain cats, of course!) - and you have some of the most mesmerising memes out there. It's not only funny cat memes, it's cat memes with some special and beautiful cat qualities.",

    "description": "Hey there, fellow feline enthusiasts. One thing all cat lovers understand is that cats are the ones who choose us. Not the other way around. And when they do, it feels like a little piece of everyday magic. That is exactly what happened to the original poster, a kindhearted couple who had been quietly watching a cautious calico drift in and out of their yard for months. She was beautiful, independent, and never let anyone get too close. They named her Cleo and assumed she would always be just a passing visitor.But one quiet morning, everything changed. Cleo was curled up fast asleep on their back porch. Tired and clearly hungry, she let OP approach her with food and gentle care. She ate like she had not had a proper meal in days. And then she came back. Again and again. What started as cautious visits turned into naps on their patio furniture, mealtime meetups, and eventually, full cuddles and trust. Bringing a stray into your home is not always easy. It takes patience, respect, and an understanding that trust is earned slowly. OP gave Cleo all the time and space she needed. They never pushed. They simply waited. And in doing so, they let her decide what she needed most.",

    "description": "Early in my career, I had the misfortune of doing a lot of Crystal Reports work. Crystal Reports is another one of those tools that lets non-developer, non-database savvy folks craft reports. Which, like so often happens, means that the users dig themselves incredible holes and need professional help to get back out, because at the end of the day, when the root problem is actually complicated, all the helpful GUI tools in the world can't solve it for you. Michael was in a similar position as I was, but for Michael, there was a five alarm fire. It was the end of the month, and a bunch of monthly sales reports needed to be calculated. One of the big things management expected to see was a year-over-year delta on sales, and they got real cranky if the line didn't go up. If they couldn't even see the line, they went into a full on panic and assumed the sales team was floundering and the company was on the verge of collapse. Unfortunately, the report was spitting out an error: \"A day number must be between 1 and the number of days in the month.\" Michael dug in, and found this \"delight\" inside of a function called one_year_ago: Local StringVar yearStr := Left({?ReportToDate}, 4); Local StringVar monthStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 5, 2); Local StringVar dayStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 7, 2); Local StringVar hourStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 9, 2); Local StringVar minStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 11, 2); Local StringVar secStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 13, 2); Local NumberVar LastYear; LastYear := ToNumber(YearStr) - 1; YearStr := Replace (toText(LastYear),'.00' , '' ); YearStr := Replace (YearStr,',' , '' ); //DateTime(year, month, day, hour, min, sec); //Year + Month + Day + Hour + min + sec; // string value DateTime(ToNumber(YearStr), ToNumber(MonthStr), ToNumber(dayStr), ToNumber(HourStr), ToNumber(MinStr),ToNumber(SecStr) ); We've all seen string munging in date handling before. That's not surprising. But what's notable about this one is the day on which it started failing. As stated, it was at the end of the month. But which month? February. Specifically, February 2024, a leap year. Since they do nothing to adjust the dayStr when constructing the date, they were attempting to construct a date for 29-FEB-2023, which is not a valid date. Michael writes: Yes, it's Crystal Reports, but surprisingly not having date manipulation functions isn't amongst it's many, many flaws. It's something I did in a past life isn't it?? The fix was easy enough- rewrite the function to actually use date handling. This made a simpler, basically one-line function, using Crystal's built in functions. That fixed this particular date handling bug, but there were plenty more places where this kind of hand-grown string munging happened, and plenty more opportunities for the report to fail.
