    "description": "How old were you when you got your first cell phone? For many of us, this was a rite of passage. First, you'd notice as your friends started showing off their phones. They could snap photos, text, and talk for hours. You'd have to wait until you got home to use your landline phone, and as for \"texting,\" you'd have to settle for instant messaging your friends on the computer. So you'd go to your parents, sit them down, and start begging. You'd have to give them many reasons why you should have a phone, too. \"Everyone has them! It'll make me safer! I just really want one!\" you'd explain. Then, your parents would deliberate. And finally, if you were lucky enough to have cool parents, then you would get a phone. Each parent feels differently about the age at which their child should have a phone, though. Today's iPhones are way more powerful than the flip phones of yore. Instead of just snapping grainy photos, you're giving your kiddo access to Instagram, Snapchat, FaceTiming, and endless texting. I think some parents have trouble grasping how important these things are while growing up in a constantly-online environment, and a lot of commenters told this person that they should allow their kid to have a phone for exactly that reason. Up next, read about this couple who were confronted by an unhappy waiter over their decision not to tip on a $30 bill.",

Well, that all changed when they decided to buy their place. On top of that, the former renter opted to run for president of their HOA after the former president stepped down following two decades in the position. Now, he's president of the HOA, and the entitled neighbor has to show him some respect every time they run into each other.

Plus, it's an extra excuse to dress up our cats in rainbow attire to purrfectly celebrate this colorful month. Our floofy felines are proud of their two daddies and they make up our fuzzy family that we couldn't live without. That's why we've collected some of the silliest cat memes from across the whiskery wild web of cats supporting their pawrents during Pride month (in their own feline way, of course).These kitties don't care wherever you fall underneath the LGBTQ+ umbrella, they are equally as judgmental either way. They've got that funny feline flavor that we know and love from classic cat memes, but with some added rainbows and sass that comes with a bunch of gays gathered together. We hope you have a pawsitively joyful Pride and remember - your cats don't care if you're gay, they only care that you feed them on time. Enjoy!Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.

Because while we love every single cat out there, the more we learn about bobcats, the more we seem to fall for them. Bobcats are playful, and they will break into a golf course if they see a ball there that they want to play with. Bobcats are affectionate, and they will take in kittens from other families and other species and raise them as their own. Bobcats are silly and get attached to the silliest of toys, even if that toy is just… fennel. And bobcats seems to be learning… little by little, that some humans are not so bad. Now, that might not always be a good thing. Wild things are wild for a reason, and most of these cats still stay away. But some make the same calculation that house cats do… maybe sticking around humans, especially when you are in need of help or are vulnerable, like this momma bobcat who just had her kittens, is better than being in the wild.  Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/integral-to-a-database-read",
    "description": "One of the key points of confusion for people unfamiliar with Java is the distinction between true object types, like Integer, and \"primitive\" types, like int. This is made worse by the collection types, like ArrayList, which needs to hold a true object type, but can't hold a primitive. A generic ArrayList is valid, but ArrayList won't compile. Fortunately for everyone, Java automatically \"boxes\" types- at least since Java 5, way back in 2004- so integerList.add(5) and int n = integerList.get(0) will both work just fine. Somebody should have told that to Alice's co-worker, who spends a lot of code to do some type gymnastics that they shouldn't have: try { ps = conn.prepareStatement(SQL_GET_LOT_WORKUP_STATUSES); ps.setLong(1, _lotId); rs = ps.executeQuery(); while (rs.next()) { result.add(new Integer(rs.getInt(1))); } } finally { CloseUtil.close(ps,rs); } // instatiate a the array _workupStatuses = new int[result.size()]; // convert the integers to ints for (int h=0; h This runs a query against the database, and then iterates across the result to populate a List type with integers, and right away we're getting into confused territory. rs.getInt returns an int primitive, which they manually box with new Integer, and stuff into the List. And look, I wouldn't really call that a WTF, but it's what they do next that leaves me scratching my head. They initialize a private member, _workupStatuses to a new array of ints. Then they copy every integer from the result collection into the array, first by casting the get return value to Integer, then by pulling off the intValue. In the end, this whole dance happens because Java ResultSet types open cursors on the database side and thus don't have the capacity to tell you how many rows they returned. You need to iterate across each record until it runs out of results. That's why they populate an intermediate list. Then they can check the size and create an array, but that itself is a big why. I'm not going to say that using arrays in Java is an instant anti-pattern, but it's always something to be suspicious of, especially when you're holding result sets. It's probably a premature optimization: the key performance distance is on insertions where an ArrayList may need to resize and copy its internal backing store. My suspicion, however, is that this code falls into the category of \"C programmer forced to do Java\". They're comfortable with an array of integers, which is covers 90% of the data types you use in C but a dynamic, complicated data structure is horrifying to them. So they use it when they absolutely have to, and then throw it away as quickly as they can to get back to what they're familiar with. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.

    "description": "Today's short function comes from Janusz, and it's anything you want it to be: public static function isAnything($data) { return true; } Honestly, I'm surprised that it was made static. Sure, static is the correct choice for this function, at least if we're describing anything about this function as \"correct\". I'm still surprised. It's got an accurate name given its behavior, it's scoped correctly. It still shouldn't exist and I have no idea what lead to it existing, but that's not surprising.
