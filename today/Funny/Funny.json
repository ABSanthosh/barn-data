    "description": "Workers will endure low pay, constant schedule changes, and even irritating coworkers, but if the boss doesn't have their back, they'll be heading for the door ASAP. Some workplaces are revolving doors of employees coming and going. No matter how diligent you are, or how much you value the work you're doing, you can count on that type of company culture to bring you down. When your workplace doesn't value you, you often try even harder to get some praise from your managers. But the longer you go without reaping any benefits from your work, the more you start to daydream about quitting. These people quit on the spot, because sometimes you just can't wait that two weeks. Plus, if your employer has stopped respecting you, there's no need to show them any respect in return, right? Up next, read about some people who are certainly having a worse day than you, like one person who shared that sadly, \"I brought muffins to work because of my birthday, 5 minutes later they told me I am fired.\"",

I watched as glamorous celebs strutted the red carpet in the moments leading up to the ceremony. Then, just moments before the ceremony, the centerpiece of the entire procession, was set to begin, the streaming service just… glitched. Logged out and locked out, the login screen was unresponsive, refusing all attempts to even reset passwords. Horrified and desperate I did the only thing I could: I checked in with the usual social media haunts to find concurrence and make sure that I wasn't alone. To my (partial) relief and resignation, it wasn't that some phishing scam had \"hacked\" my account, it was a widespread issue for anyone daring to watch the Oscars without cable.",

These people must have never had cats in their lives. Because cats care about their humans so, so much. That is something undeniable that you learn incredibly fast as a cat owner. And sure, some cats have funny ways of showing affection, but that doesn't make their affection any less real. It just means that you have to pay attention to their love languages a little more closely. And all cats have one thing in common - cats will be there for you when you need them the most. They can tell when something is wrong with you. They know when you actually need their help - emotional, or like the cat today - physical. The cat in this story knew that something was wrong with one of his humans, and whether he knew what he was doing or not, keeping this woman conscious until the EMTs arrived to help her most likely has saved her life.",

Your cat demands treats, and they demand it right meow. They might meow very gently and ask for the treats in a polite way, but the cats press their demands in this way or another. Every cat pawrent knows that treats are an essential part of a cat's day.Since you've probably already given treats to your cat (because cat pawrents always cave in to the floofiest of demands, obviously) - it's time for some cat memes. Why? Because your cat is busy eating the tasty treat they've just received, you probably feel the absence of their demanding meows. So we gathered some cat memes that seem to press the treat demands just like cats. They're some sassy cat memes, but full of this fluffy feline cuteness.",

It’s full of fun, unique cooperative mechanics that will have you and whoever you're playing with working together to navigate each new level. Kara and I had planned on giving it a quick try and then playing some Marvel Rivals but once we fired it up we couldn’t stop and spent the rest of the night in Split Fiction. The hook is also great as the game has you bouncing between the imaginations of two different writers, one who does fantasy and the other who does Sci-Fi. Don’t skip this one if you have a gaming partner. It would also make a great entry point if you have someone who isn’t a gamer yet but you want to play something with them. Kara and I give it all the thumbs up.",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/where-is-the-validation-at",
    "description": "As oft stated, the \"right\" way to validate emails is to do a bare minimum sanity check on format, and then send a verification message to the email address the user supplied; it's the only way to ensure that what they gave you isn't just syntactically valid, but is actually usable. But even that simple approach leaves places to go wrong. Take a look at this code, from Lana. public function getEmailValidationErrors($data): array { $errors = []; if (isset($data[\"email\"]) \u0026\u0026 !empty($data[\"email\"])) { if (!str_contains($data[\"email\"], \"@\")) { $error[\"email\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_AT\"; } if (!str_contains($data[\"email\"], \".\")) { $error[\"email\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_DOT\"; } if (strrpos($data[\"email\"], \"@\") \u003e strrpos($data[\"email\"], \".\")) { $error[\"email\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_TLD\"; } } if (isset($data[\"email1\"]) \u0026\u0026 !empty($data[\"email1\"])) { if (!str_contains($data[\"email1\"], \"@\")) { $error[\"email1\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_AT\"; } if (!str_contains($data[\"email1\"], \".\")) { $error[\"email1\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_DOT\"; } if (strrpos($data[\"email1\"], \"@\") \u003e strrpos($data[\"email1\"], \".\")) { $error[\"email1\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_TLD\"; } } if (isset($data[\"email2\"]) \u0026\u0026 !empty($data[\"email2\"])) { if (!str_contains($data[\"email2\"], \"@\")) { $error[\"email2\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_AT\"; } if (!str_contains($data[\"email2\"], \".\")) { $error[\"email2\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_DOT\"; } if (strrpos($data[\"email2\"], \"@\") \u003e strrpos($data[\"email2\"], \".\")) { $error[\"email2\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_TLD\"; } } if (isset($data[\"email3\"]) \u0026\u0026 !empty($data[\"email3\"])) { if (!str_contains($data[\"email3\"], \"@\")) { $error[\"email3\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_AT\"; } if (!str_contains($data[\"email3\"], \".\")) { $error[\"email3\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_DOT\"; } if (strrpos($data[\"email3\"], \"@\") \u003e strrpos($data[\"email3\"], \".\")) { $error[\"email3\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_TLD\"; } } return $errors; } Let's start with the obvious problem: repetition. This function doesn't validate simply one email, but four, by copy/pasting the same logic multiple times. Lana didn't supply the repeated blocks, just noted that they existed, so let's not pick on the bad names: \"email1\", etc.- that's just my placeholder. I assume it's different contact types for a customer, or similar. Now, the other problems range from trivial to comical. First, the PHP function empty returns true if the variable has a zero/falsy value or is not set, which means it implies an isset, making the first branch redundant. That's trivial. The way the checks get logged into the $error array, they can overwrite each other, meaning if you forget the \"@\" and the \".\", it'll only complain about the \".\", but if you forget the \".\", it'll complain about not having a valid TLD (the \"NO_DOT\" error will never be output). That's silly. Finally, the $errors array is the return value, but the $error array is where we store our errors, meaning this function doesn't return anything in the first place. And that means that it's a email validation function which doesn't do anything at all, which honestly- probably for the best.
