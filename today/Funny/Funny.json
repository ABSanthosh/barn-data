This 26-year-old youngster is getting their first real dose of what it means to be a self-sustaining person in this wonderful world of bills, burnout, and brain-draining jobs. Their first smokey, bitter taste of adulting.Young, fresh, and armed with degrees that scream \"hire me,\" their already learning the hard truth: no one warns you that being a grown-up means choosing between work that fries your brain and work that doesn't pay the rent.He's only four months into his shiny new job, and already he's longing for the simpler days of gas stations and kennel tech gigs. You know, the good old days, way back when life was straightforward–do the task, clock out, go home. But now? Now it's all about \"mental effort,\" \"growth,\" and trying not to feel like a complete dimwit after eight hours of constant thinking.Turns out, being \"gifted\" in school doesn't prepare you for the draining grind of corporate life. Who knew?But hey, welcome to adulthood, where every choice is a lose-lose situation. Want a job that pays the bills? Cool, just give your energy and sanity. Want something low-stress? No problem, good luck affording groceries.",

    "description": "When you start your career path, you want to work your way up. Everybody knows that. It's different for every field. Some more toxic than others. Some not toxic at all! But it's pretty obvious that you can't just gossip your way to the top… First of all, this isn't a sorority popularity contest. Second of all, that game of telephone you're playing can very much end up at the top and not convey the message you were intending. For example, if you're telling everyone that you are the big boss around this town, when really you are just a hire hand, you might just tick off the people who are actually paying you. You know what happens when you do that? You get fired.  This project manager seemed to think just talking himself up was the way to get a promotion. He constantly belittled the owner for the small company he worked for behind his back. However, a small company means that your words can and will very easily make it around the office. So when the actual owner of the company you work for, aka the person who signs off on your paychecks, here's you have been belittling them, it's most definitely not going to end pretty for you.",

    "description": "Look, as cat people, the thing that we want more than anything in the world - more than even adopting a cat ourselves, is to be able to live like a cat. Like a grumpy cat specifically. Just imagine, there is a human feeding you all day long, and you can be as mean to them as you want to be, and they will still love you. You can knock their stuff over, you can scratch them and bite them, you can complain about your breakfast being five minutes late, and they will fall on their knees to receive even a smidge of love from you. That's what we want to be, and that's what these funny cat memes encompass. Hey, if we can't live like a cat, then we may as well make memes about cats, and make them as funny and relatable as pawssible. Silly cat memes like these are the only thing that gives us comfort during those moments that we realize - the hard way - that smacking someone in the face for doing something we don't like is not the right thing to do.",

Often we will look upon a poor purr-machine and think to ourselves that it is so sad that no one is helping them, or at best call an animal shelter to see if they can help. But in fact, we should take a leaf out of his heroic hooman's book and just 'take the cat now' and figure the rest out later. Forget about your landlord or roommates, forget about what you were meant to do with your day. If you come across a kitty in need, it is a sign from the Cat Distribution System that your time has come to step up to the plate.And the wonderful woman in this story did just that. She planned to make herself a wholesome home to live out her days in. complete with all the fixings and mod cons she had always dreamt off. But before long she realized that dream was not meant to be, for there was a much greater purrpouse prepared for her home.",

We had not yet arrived at the era of a Resident Evil, where the game Resident Evil begins by literally saying the words \"Resident Evil\" out loud.

    "title": "The Big Refactoring Update",
    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/the-big-refactoring-update",
    "description": "Today's anonymous submitter spent a few weeks feeling pretty good about themselves. You see, they'd inherited a gigantic and complex pile of code, an application spread out across 15 backend servers, theoretically organized into \"modules\" and \"microservices\" but in reality was a big ball of mud. And after a long and arduous process, they'd dug through that ball of mud and managed to delete 190 files, totaling 30,000 lines of code. That was fully 2/3rds of the total codebase, gone- and yet the tests continued to pass, the application continued to run, and everyone was just much happier with it. Two weeks later, a new ticket comes in: users are getting a 403 error when trying to access the \"User Update\" screen. Our submitter has seen a lot of these tickets, and it almost always means that the user's permissions are misconfigured. It's an easy fix, and not a code problem. Just to be on the safe side, though, they pull up the screen with their account- guaranteed to have the right permissions- and get a 403. As you can imagine, the temptation to sneak a few fixes in alongside this massive refactoring was impossible to resist. One of the problems was that most of their routes were camelCase URLs, but userupdate was not. So they'd fixed it. It was a minor change, and it worked in testing. So what was happening? Well, there was a legacy authorization database. It was one of those 15 backend servers, and it ran no web code, and thus wasn't touched by our submitter's refactoring. Despite their web layer having copious authorization and authentication code, someone had decided back in the olden days, to implement that authorization and authentication in its own database. Not every request went through this database. It impacted new sessions, but only under specific conditions. But this database had a table in it, which listed off all the routes. And unlike the web code, which used regular expressions for checking routes, and were case insensitive, this database did a strict equality comparison. The fix was simple: update the table to allow userUpdate. But it also pointed towards a deeper, meaner target for future refactoring: dealing with this sometimes required (but often not!) authentication step lurking in a database that no one had thought about until our submitter's refactoring broke something.

    "description": "Paul's co-worker needed to manage some data in a tree. To do that, they wrote this Java function: private static boolean existsFather(ArrayList fatherFolder, Integer fatherId) { for (Integer father : fatherFolder) { if (father.equals(fatherId)) return true; } return false; } I do not know what the integers in use represent here. I don't think they're actually representing \"folders\", despite the variable names in the code. I certainly hope it's not representing files and folders, because that implies they're tossing around file handles in some C-brained approach (but badly, since it implies they've got an open handle for every object). The core WTF, in my opinion, is this- the code clearly implies some sort of tree structure, the tree contains integers, but they're not using any of the Java structures for handling trees, and implementing this slipshod approach. And even then, this code could be made more generic, as the general process works with any sane Java type. But there's also the obvious WTF: the java.util.Collection interface, which an ArrayList implements, already handles all of this in its contains method. This entire function could be replaced with fatherFolder.contains(fatherId). Paul writes: \"I guess the last developer didn't know that every implementation of a java.util.Collection has a method called contains. At least they knew how to do a for-each.\".
