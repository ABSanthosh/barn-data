    "description": "As a society, we are much more accommodating these days to dietary restrictions than we used to be. We've found ways to turn just about anything into protein, discovered what feels like a million types of plant milk, and know how to make bread with no bread in it. Science has been able to adapt to allergies, diets, and fads in ways that were unthinkable just years ago. Along with the physical progress we've made, there's much social progress as well. Vegans and vegetarians aren't painted as the hippie-dippie types anymore, and oat milk is the most popular coffee addition in cafes today. It's become so easy to accommodate these issues that it's almost second nature. Yes, it would almost be silly to deny someone their right to a meal just because they \"eat funny.\" We should all strive to make everyone feel comfortable, and it's now just practical to do so. This is why one woman came to the internet to ask for advice when her extended family cut her out of their big family trip altogether because of her genuinely serious dietary allergies. Is she right to be upset? Or should she just sit this one out? Read on to decide.",

    "description": "If you've never had the dream of becoming a musician, you've probably still had the dream of being in a relationship with one. Going on the road and getting to be a part of the glitz and glamour. Getting songs dedicated to you. Being in the audience and thinking to yourself, 'That one up there? They're mine all mine.' It's a romantic idea, and yet, it's hard not to imagine the drawbacks. Their long nights at the studio doing 'just one more song.' Their long weeks away on tour when you can't go to follow them. The sobering reality of loving a rockstar is enough to make you throw away the whole idea. Or at least, to keep it in your daydreams.Still, whoever our partner may be, we want to support them in their hobbies or interests. And if that means letting them play in the basement with their unsuccessful band, then so be it. One woman has been doing that for years for her husband. But lately, she's been getting stuck babysitting his bandmates' kids. Should she just grin and bear it? Or does she have the right to put her foot down in this situation? Scroll through to decide.",

    "description": "Hey there, cat pawrents. If you've ever adopted a kitten, you know that they are both fluffy, sweet little angels, and also purrfessional life-destroyers at the same time. One second, they're snuggled up on your chest, snoozing away, and then a few hours later (specifically at night), they're running around your house breaking literally everything pawssible. It's a lot. And the energy is never ending. This is why we always tell people to do their research before adopting a kitten, and even then it can't fully prepaw you for the chaos that will come.The only way out is through, so you just have to live through it and know that it will get better. Now, some kittens are easier than others. The really hard ones make you question your reality, and even force you to consider rehoming your tiny baby. After being sleep deprived for the last couple of months, one such feline pawrent was at their limit. They asked the internet for advice, and what they received was not quite what they expected. Scroll down to see how they solved it below!",

    "description": "There's nothing funnier in the meme sphere more than cat memes. Yes, yes, we're aware there are other memes that are funny, we do not deny reality. But there's something special about cat memes. They're not only funny, as most memes are (or at least as some memes are) - they also have cats. And if it was not clear up until this point - we're very much in the opinion that cats make everything better. Even memes. You have a meme, you make it with a cat, and it's instantly better than it was before. Cat memes are simply the best.Since cat memes are the funniest, they are the best kind of memes, we want to share as much of them with as many people as we can. This is why we prepared this comedic compound of cat comedy made of 22 funny feline memes. All these feline funnies are really making us laugh here like no other kind of meme. Can we agree at least that cat memes are cute?",

    "description": "We like trains here at Error'd, and you all seem to like trains too. That must be the main reason we get so many submissions about broken information systems. \"Pass,\" said Jozsef . I think that train might have crashed already.   An anonymous subscriber shared an epic tale some time ago. They explained thus. \"(I couldn't capture in the photo, but the next station after Duivendrecht was showing the time of 09:24+1.) We know Europe has pretty good trains, and even some high-speed lines. But this was the first time I boarded a time-traveling train. At first I was annoyed to be 47 minutes late. I thought I could easily walk from Amsterdam Centraal to Muiderpoort in less than the 53 minutes that this train would take. But I was relieved to know the trip to the further stations was going to be quicker, and I would arrive there even before arriving at the earlier stations.\" I think the explanation here is that this train is currently expected to arrive at Muiderport around 10:01. But it's still projected to arrive at the following stop at 9:46, and more surprisingly at the successive stops at 9:35 and 9:25.   Railfan Richard B. recently shared \"Points failure on the West Coast Main Line has disrupted the linear nature of time.\"   and quite some time ago, he also sent us this snap, singing \"That train that's bound for glory? It runs through here.\"   An unrelated David B. wonders \"When is the next train? We don't know, it's running incognito.\"   And finally, courageous Ivan got sideways underground. \"Copenhagen subway system may have fully automated trains, but their informational screens need a little manual help every now and then.\"   [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.

    "description": "There are real advantages to taking a functional programming approach to expressing problems. Well, some problems, anyway. Kevin sends us this example of elegant, beautiful functional code in C#: //create a range of dates List dates = Enumerable.Range (0, 1 + settings.EndDate.Subtract (settings.BeginDate).Days).Select (offset =\u003e settings.BeginDate.AddDays(offset)).ToList(); foreach (DateTime procDate in dates) { /*.snip.*/ } If you're not sure what this code does, it's okay- Kevin rewrote it and \"ruined\" it: DateTime procDate = settings.BeginDate; while(procDate \u003c= settings.EndDate) { /*.snip.*/ procDate= procDate.AddDays(1); } The goal of this code is simply to do something for every day within a range of dates. These two approaches vary a bit in terms of readability though. I guess the loop in the functional version isn't mutating anything, I suppose. But honestly, I'm surprised that this didn't take the extra step of using the .ForEach function (which takes a lambda and applies it to each parameter). Heck, with that approach, they could have done this whole thing in a single statement.
