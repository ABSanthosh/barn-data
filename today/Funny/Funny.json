    "description": "Taking on extra work at the workplace is (almost) never a good idea…We're sold this ideal that grinding and working hard will eventually get us somewhere, that all our hard work and determination will one day be rewarded. It is true that hard work, being prepared, and putting yourself in the right place at the right time are the best ways to take advantage of opportunities that might present themselves in the future. But working yourself ragged for your employer and teetering on the edge of burnout is definitely not the way to be best prepared for those opportunities.Without the right mentor or boss, any extra work you're doing will soon go from barely appreciated to unnoticed. Extra shifts, late nights, and weekends will get overlooked as your extra efforts mask over and hide problems, allowing your boss and management to turn their attention to other things and meaning that you'll be blamed now when that extra work isn't getting finished.",

    "description": "It's a good thing winter has come to an end because people are not the kindest to one another when they are facing the frigid elements. There is something about human behavior during a freezing winter that brings out our primal instincts. Suddenly, it's survival of the fittest. If you trip and fall on the ice, someone might not be there to pick you up because they are on a mission to get inside as soon as possible. To that end, neighbors become, well, less neighborly during these times. They are less inclined to help one another out and more inclined to act selfishly or just stay away from human interaction as much as possible. I myself am guilty of this, but I would never go so far as to steal my neighbor's parking spot to get inside faster. This person's neighbor had it coming!",

    "description": "Hey there friends and feline enthusiasts. Losing a beloved pet is one of the most heartbreaking experiences a family can go through. It creates a space in your home and your heart that feels impossible to fill. So when a tiny, scrappy kitten appeared in the yard just days after this family lost their sweet dog, it felt like more than a coincidence. It felt like something bigger.For two weeks, they fed him every night, unsure if he had a home or if he would let them get close. Eventually, they were able to bring him inside, where a vet confirmed he was just 12 weeks old and born the very same week their dog had passed. Covered in dirt and severely underweight, he clearly needed a family just as much as they needed him.They named him Franklin, and over the past five months, he has settled into their lives like he was meant to be there all along. From play-fighting with their other dog to sleeping on his human's chest every night, Franklin has become a source of joy and healing. His soft purrs and tiny coos are daily reminders that sometimes the universe delivers exactly what you need right when you need it most. And now our hearts have been officially warmed.",

    "description": "Every chonky cat child has a secret to confess. Usually it has to do with where they have been stashing their stolen treats, but today they are confessing to something much more serious. For today, the chonkers of the cat world are coming clean about their intrusive thoughts and what they have made them do. Which as you can imagine must contain some seriously strange behaviors, considering that these creatures consider hiding stolen treats to be a normal part of everyday life.So if you have been wanting to know why your fur baby has been behaving strangely, or you simply love indulging in the gossipy goodness of clawminal cat children, then we recommend locking into this list with three seatbelts and holding on tight for a wild ride.",

    "description": "I never did explain the elusive off-by-one I hinted at, did I? A little meta, perhaps. It is our practice at Error'd to supply five nuggets of joy each week. But in episode previous-plus-one, you actually got six! (Or maybe, depending on how you count them, that's yet another off-by-one. I slay me.) If that doesn't tickle you enough, just wait until you hear what Dave L. brought us. Meanwhile... \"YATZP\" scoffed self-styled Foo AKA F. Yet Another Time Zone P*, I guess. Not wrong. According to Herr Aka F., \"German TV teletext (yes, we still have it!) botched the DST start (upper right corner). The editors realized it and posted a message stating as much, sent from the 'future' (i.e. correct) time zone.\"   Michael R. wrote in with a thought-provoker. If I'm representing one o'clock as 1:00, two o'clock as 2:00, and so forth, why should zero o'clock be the only time represented with not just one, but TWO leading zeroes? Logically, zero o'clock should be represented simply by :00, right?   Meanwhile, (just) Randy points out that somebody failed to pay attention to detail. \"Did a full-scroll on Baeldung's members page and saw this. Sometimes, even teachers don't get it right.\"   In case Michael R. is still job-hunting Gary K. has found the perfect position for everyone. That is, assuming the tantalizingly missing Pay Range section conforms to the established pattern. \"Does this mean I should put my qualifications in?\" he wondered. Run, don't walk.   And in what I think is an all-time first for us, Dave L. brings (drum roll) an audio Error'd \"I thought you'd like this recording from my Garmin watch giving me turn-by-turn directions: In 280.097 feet turn right. That's two hundred eighty feet and ONE POINT ONE SIX FOUR INCHES. Accuracy to a third of a millimeter!\" Don't move your hand!

    "description": "Sean sends us a one-line function that is a delight, if by delight you mean \"horror\". You'll be shocked to know it's PHP. function proget(){foreach($_GET as $k=\u003e$v){if($k==\"h\"){$GLOBALS[\"h\"]=1;}$p=explode(\",\",$k);}return($p);} //function to process GET headers Based on the comment, proget is a shorthand for process_get_parameters. Which is sort of what it does. Sort of. Let's go through this. We iterate across our $_GET parameters using $k for the key, $v for the value, but we never reference the value so forget it exists. We're iterating across every key. The first thing we check is if a key \"h\" exists. We don't look at its value, we just check if it exists, and if it does, we set a global variable. And this, right here, is enough for this to be a WTF. The logic of \"set a global variable based on the existence of a query parameter regardless of the value of the query parameter\" is… a lot. But then, somehow, this actually gets more out there. We explode the key on commas (explode being PHP's much cooler name for split), which implies… our keys may be lists of values? Which I feel like is an example of someone not understanding what a \"key\" is. But worse than that, we just do this for every key, and return the results of performing that operation on the last key. Which means that if this function is doing anything at all, it's entirely dependent on the order of the keys. Which, PHP does order the keys by the order they're added, which I take to mean that if the URL has query params like ?foo=1\u0026h=0\u0026a,b,c,d=wtf. Or, if we're being picky about encoding, ?foo=1\u0026h=0\u0026a%2Cb%2Cc%2Cd=wtf. The only good news here is that PHP handles the encoding/decoding for you, so the explode will work as expected. This is the kind of bad code that leaves me with lots of questions, and I'm not sure I want any of the answers. How did this happen, and why are questions best left unanswered, because I think the answers might cause more harm.
