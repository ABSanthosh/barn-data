The bad news is that the boat is the Titanic, the setting is Groundhog Day, and nobody's getting off. Not exactly the inspirational pep talk you were hoping for, but hey, at least we're sinking together. Over and over again.Unfortunately for us, we've landed in a time of limbo. We're all stuck. If you want to feel a little better about it, just think of yourself as a Greek myth—you're Sisyphus. Hooray! Us modern mythical beings seem to exist in two states: either desperately looking (or let's be honest, begging) for a job or hating the one we already have. Yay! It's like a rollercoaster ride with one single loop that just repeats forever. Thrilling.",

We're sure we need to tell that to your cat, at least, because while you were waking up this morning, they were still sleeping; while you were drinking your morning coffee, your cat was still sleeping; while you were leaving the house to go to work, your cat was still sleeping; while you started to do your job, taking care of all your responsibilities, being a good employee, guess what? Your cat was still sleeping.Wouldn't you like to sleep like your cat? We know we would. Like, we wouldn't object to sleeping 16 hours a day and then nap for at least 4 hours more. Sounds like a purrfect sleeping schedule to us. But that's why we look at all these sleepy cat memes all the time - because we'd like to be deep in sleep like them, because they're cats.So here we are, looking at these memes, and thinking they need to be shared. There you go, these sleepy cat memes are here for you to use. Send them to your boss - they might send you for some mandatory sleeping time. You have nothing to lose.",

Hoomans come and go, but our relationship with our cats is one that has saved us, brought us joy, and made our lives better time and time again. We wouldn't trade them for the world, so if a potential partner doesn't get along with our cats, we can say with purrfect certainty that it is a huge red flag.They don't have to love our sweet kitties as much as we do (as if anyone ever could), but they at least have to enjoy their purresence and give them the respect they deserve. If they don't, it's time to kick them to the curb and start something new. We know that may sound pawsitively harsh, but believe us, if they don't like pets, they'll never fully merge with your lifestyle. That's why when this younger boyfriend moved in with his feline-fanatic girlfriend, they ran into a situation messier than our cat's litter box. Scroll through the full thread below!",

    "description": "Singletons is arguably the easiest to understand design pattern, and thus, one of the most frequently implemented design patterns, even- especially- when it isn't necessary. Its simplicity is its weakness. Bartłomiej inherited some code which implemented this pattern many, many times. None of them worked quite correctly, and all of them tried to create a singleton a different way. For example, this one: public class SystemMemorySettings { private static SystemMemorySettings _instance; public SystemMemorySettings() { if (_instance == null) { _instance = this; } } public static SystemMemorySettings GetInstance() { return _instance; } public void DoSomething() { ... // (this must only be done for singleton instance - not for working copy) if (this != _instance) { return; } ... } } The only thing they got correct was the static method which returns an instance, but everything else is wrong. They construct the instance in the constructor, meaning this isn't actually a singleton, since you can construct it multiple times. You just can't use it. And you can't use it because of the real \"magic\" here: DoSomething, which checks if the currently active instance is also the originally constructed instance. If it isn't, this function just fails silently and does nothing. A common critique of singletons is that they're simply \"global variables with extra steps,\" but this doesn't even succeed at that- it's just a failure, top to bottom.
