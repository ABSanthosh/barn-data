    "description": "Nobody likes to be forgotten or left behind, whether on purpose or by total accident. When someone you know is organizing an event and you find out you are not invited, even if it was unintentional, it is such an awkward conversation to have that you often don't know how to approach it. What are you even supposed to say? \"Hey, was I not invited because you don't want me there, or did you just completely forget I existed?\"However, if something like that does happen to you, it is still better to talk to someone about it than to completely ignore the problem. If you have a mutual friend who was invited, maybe you should ask them to approach the person holding the event and mention you were excluded. That might be the only approach that can save some embarrassment for both sides.That is what most people suggest the employee in this Reddit story to do after they found out they are the only person in the office not invited to the company meeting. But for some reason, the employee had another idea in mind…Keep scrolling to read the full story.

    "description": "Hotel work is not easy work. Even the big, expensive, fancy pants ones have their list of issues. But everyone knows to be extra wary of the cheap side-of-the-road ones. The ones that have the \"vacancy\" sign haphazardly hanging from their marquee with an ominous feel to it. Those are the ones you need to steer clear of. But what about those ones that meet you halfway? They're not the cheapest, but they're definitely not the most expensive. Unfortunately, you can very easily think you're getting a good deal, but in fact, you are getting something that might leave you traumatized. Take for example, this hotel an employee ranted about on Reddit. The place is not the cheapest, it costs $100 or more a night to stay there. So why is it that most of the rooms have sewage backups, bedbugs, or a broken AC? Why is it that they don't even have a license to run the place? Because they have just been able to get away with it, for this long… Until now. The employee had it one day after several unlawful check-ins and called the Health Inspector. When they showed up he not only fully cooperated and provided a skeleton key, but he also gave them a list of rooms that are still available to book but are absolutely fowl. You better believe this health inspector found a disgusting amount of violations. Good for that employee! Read the whole situation below.",

    "link": "https://cheezburger.com/37265413/pawrent-reunites-with-sweet-orange-cat-after-he-escaped-his-home-during-hurricane-helene-seen",
    "description": "A pawrent's biggest nightmare is their pet babies running around outside during extreme weather conditions. Pets have their reasons for escaping, whether that be out of fear or intrigue, but this weighs heavily on an owner's heart. Knowing that you can't protect your fur baby from Mother Nature's wrath makes withstanding extreme weather events that much more difficult.Luckily, many pawrents get happy endings with their MIA pets, like this user on TikTok. She mentions in the comments of this video that her cat escaped during Hurricane Helene. It's safe to assume that the weather was simply too dangerous to go outside looking for him, even though I know some of you pawrents would take the risk! After the hurricane had passed, she's welcomed by her kitty, looking as unbothered as ever, hanging out around the tree debris. She calls out to her ginger fella, and he slowly but surely accepts all of her rubs and pets.It's stories like these that are a testament to the love between a pawrent and their pet.

But even then it is not all too easy to keep on going, so we figured we would make this list of classic meowments from the lives of cat children to remind you feline pawrents what it is you are working for, even when you are having a hard day at work, saving up for your fur baby's fancy feast.From the family dad who was against bringing their garden cat into their home, but had no issue building it its own condo in the garden with heating and Wi-Fi, to the cheerful chonker who is always willing to lend a helping hand to hoomans who struggle to finish their food.",

Gabe had tried it once to great success on the Australian Flight, but the second time he tried it he entered a Devil Dream that lasted almost sixteen hours - one from which he could not wake. As per usual, we tried to shape and mould these horrors into something silly, an attempt at inoculation in the form of a feathered sky serpent called J.D. that at least I found enjoyable. We made a joke about me taking it, mostly just so we could see J.D. again, but until a couple weeks ago I'd never tried it at all. I only had a couple, I mostly ran out, and I'm glad. That's the kind of shit a witch would give you in a fairy tale. I have a little left, like a few crumbs of lembas wrapped in mallorn leaves, and I'll be using it to board one of the motherfucking White Ships to the motherfucking West. I apologize in advance - it would appear Dreaded Continuity has reared its wicked and serpentine head once again.",

    "description": "Working at a company where the leadership started as technical people has its advantages, but it can also carry costs. Arthur is in one such environment, and while it means that management and labor have a common vocabulary, the company leadership forgets that they're not in a technical role anymore. So they still like to commit code to the project. And that's how things like this happen: if( this.idtoservice != null ) { sOwner = this.idtoservice.Common.Security.Owner; } else if( this.idtoservice != null ) { sOwner = this.idtoservice.Common.Security.Owner; } else if( this.idtoservice != null ) { sOwner = this.idtoservice.Common.Security.Owner; } This isn't one commit from the CEO, it's 4 different commits. It seems like the CEO, perhaps, doesn't understand merge conflicts? This particular bit of bad code is at least absolutely harmless and likely gets compiled out, but it doesn't mean that Arthur doesn't feel the urge to drink every time his CEO makes a new commit.

Here we have loop unrolling taken to a new, ridiculous extent. The loop is executed in PHP, and \"rendered\" in JavaScript, outputting a huge pile of array assignments. Worse than that, even the name of the variable is generated in PHP- group_Arr_. This pattern was used everywhere, and sometimes I wouldn't even call it a pattern- huge blocks of code were copy/pasted with minor modifications. This pile of spaghetti was, as you can imagine, difficult to understand or modify. But here's the scary part: it was remarkably bug free. The developer responsible for this had managed to do this everywhere, and it worked. Reliably. Any other developer who tried to change it ended up causing a cascade of failures that meant weeks of debugging to make what felt like should be minor changes, but in the state which ALicia inherited it, everything worked.
