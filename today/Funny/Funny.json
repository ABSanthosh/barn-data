    "description": "This, feline fam, is a purrfect example of why we prefer cats over hoomans. We love our feline family more than life itself. Our hooman one… meh. We love them, but that doesn't mean we have to like them. But, to be fair, we never have to lend our cats money - we just have to pay for them for their entire lives. We knew that going into it. The sister in this post probably didn't know that she was going to have to lend her older, selfish sister over $2k when she was going through a tough time, only to be ghosted without a cent in return.The worst part is? The money isn't even for her - it's for their childhood cat. She needs an emergency surgery, and while the cat mom struggles to collect all the cash, her sister is partying on TikTok and actively ignoring her. The whole thread is below, and we even brought you the text message receipts. Scroll down to read through them below!Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

That's where cat memes come in - the dank memes energy mixed with the abundant cat wholesomeness creates the purrfect balance for internet cat comedy. Cat memes are great, funny in the exact amount for a good laugh and some warm feelings in your heart.

    "description": "The merits and qualities that can push someone into a leadership role are as surprising as they are disappointing; oftentimes, those who might actually make good leaders are passed up in favor of those who possess surprisingly undesirable qualities. You might expect them to have good knowledge and experience in handling the work at hand, along with integrity, accountability, direction, and decisiveness—you know, things that actually are commonly attributed to a good leader. My no means does this mean that a leader needs to be perfect, but being a leader means owning your mistakes and learning from them and elevating those around you.Unfortunately, who you know and how they feel about you, your complicity, and your willingness to pass exploitative policy without question will often be more likely to get you promoted than any actual leadership qualities. They might have even been good at something—once. And showed promise in a lower role, putting up good numbers, which earned them a promotion despite having no other leadership qualities. Now, as a living and walking Peter Principle, they live their life failing upwards and making those around and under them miserable…These workers gathered together to share their stories and experiences of things that their foolish and clueless bosses said to them that they still remember to this day.",

If you could just teach them this one lesson, if they could just see that their actions affect other people, maybe the world could be a slightly better one.Do we actually shake that person up? Can we get anything through their thick heads? Well, it depends on how creative you get with your lesson. Because just telling them what they are doing wrong will probably not stick the landing. It needs to be something they will remember, something that forces them to open their eyes, and hopefully, to keep them open for quite some time…The neighbor in the story below wanted to teach an entitled driver that he can't just park his car wherever he pleases, so they truly got creative with the lesson plan.",

Inexperience is better than whatever this Java code is. Object[] test = (Object[]) options; List schedulePlatformList = (List)((Object[])options)[0]; List visibleTableCols = (List)((Object[])options)[1]; We start by casting options into an array of Objects. That's already a code stench, but we actually don't even use the test variable and instead just redo the cast multiple times. But worse than that, we cast to an array of object, access an element, and then cast that element to a collection type. I do not know what is in the options variable, but based on how it gets used, I don't like it. What it seems to be is a class (holding different options as fields) rendered as an array (holding different options as elements). The new developer (ab)uses this pattern everywhere.
