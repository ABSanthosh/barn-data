    "description": "As a non-confrontational person, it's hard to resolve problems with other people. Accustomed to rolling over and accepting your fate, many non-confrontational people are tempted by the concept of tattling, or ratting on a person who's causing them grief—especially if that person is breaking a whole myriad of HOA rules. While the urge to become an HOA-tattling Karen is strong, we must fight it! This woman in our next tale successfully de-escalated a particularly perturbing neighborhood nightmare just by being frank with the people next door. It all started when the 50-something-year-old couple next door decided to build a ramshackle, DIY chicken coop on their shared property line, damaging the fence and wafting the scent of uncleaned chicken droppings into her yard. At first, she turned a blind eye, accepting cartons of eggs as penance for losing the use of half of her yard—due to the stink, of course.But when the pests started creeping into her property and into her home, she drew the line in the sand, taking a stand for non-confrontational people everywhere.",

If has always been your dream to have a huge wedding, but you love him so much, you figured you would make it work somehow! Wouldn't you just opt for a smaller wedding? Maybe put the budget towards the things that are more important to you and just toss the smaller, more expensive things that aren't that important. Things like that? Well, this young bride decided that in order to have her cake and eat it too, she was going to demand all of her friends and family throw her a wedding for free.  That's right, she said that she would call in some \"favors,\" but the point of favors is that you already did something for the other person of equal value, and now they owe you. This bride seemed to thing her friendship was enough to demand she get everything for free…",

We love them, but that doesn't mean we have to like them. But, to be fair, we never have to lend our cats money - we just have to pay for them for their entire lives. We knew that going into it. The sister in this post probably didn't know that she was going to have to lend her older, selfish sister over $2k when she was going through a tough time, only to be ghosted without a cent in return.The worst part is? The money isn't even for her - it's for their childhood cat. She needs an emergency surgery, and while the cat mom struggles to collect all the cash, her sister is partying on TikTok and actively ignoring her.

    "description": "Nina's team has a new developer on the team. They're not a junior developer, though Nina wishes they could replace this developer with a junior. Inexperience is better than whatever this Java code is. Object[] test = (Object[]) options; List schedulePlatformList = (List)((Object[])options)[0]; List visibleTableCols = (List)((Object[])options)[1]; We start by casting options into an array of Objects. That's already a code stench, but we actually don't even use the test variable and instead just redo the cast multiple times. But worse than that, we cast to an array of object, access an element, and then cast that element to a collection type. I do not know what is in the options variable, but based on how it gets used, I don't like it. What it seems to be is a class (holding different options as fields) rendered as an array (holding different options as elements). The new developer (ab)uses this pattern everywhere.

    "description": "Many nations have some form of national identification number, especially around taxes. Argentina is no exception. Their \"CUIT\" (Clave Única de Identificación Tributaria) and \"CUIL\" (Código Único de Identificación Laboral) are formatted as \"##-########-#\". Now, as datasets often don't store things in their canonical representation, Nick's co-worker was given a task: \"given a list of numbers, reformat them to look like CUIT/CUIL. That co-worker went off for five days, and produced this Java function. public String normalizarCuitCuil(String cuitCuilOrigen){ String valorNormalizado = new String(); if (cuitCuilOrigen == null || \"\".equals(cuitCuilOrigen) || cuitCuilOrigen.length() \u003c MINIMA_CANTIDAD_ACEPTADA_DE_CARACTERES_PARA_NORMALIZAR){ valorNormalizado = \"\"; }else{ StringBuilder numerosDelCuitCuil = new StringBuilder(13); cuitCuilOrigen = cuitCuilOrigen.trim(); // Se obtienen solo los números: Matcher buscadorDePatron = patternNumeros.matcher(cuitCuilOrigen); while (buscadorDePatron.find()){ numerosDelCuitCuil.append(buscadorDePatron.group()); } // Se le agregan los guiones: valorNormalizado = numerosDelCuitCuil.toString().substring(0,2) + \"-\" + numerosDelCuitCuil.toString().substring(2,numerosDelCuitCuil.toString().length()-1) + \"-\" + numerosDelCuitCuil.toString().substring(numerosDelCuitCuil.toString().length()-1, numerosDelCuitCuil.toString().length()); } return valorNormalizado; } We start with a basic sanity check that the string exists and is long enough. If it isn't, we return an empty string, which already annoys me, because an empty result is not a good way to communicate \"I failed to parse\". But assuming we have data, we construct a string builder and trim whitespace. And already we have a problem: we already validated that the string was long enough, but if the string contained more trailing whitespace than a newline, we're looking at a problem. Now, maybe we can assume the data is good, but the next line implies that we can't rely on that- they create a regex matcher to identify numeric values, and for each numeric value they find, they append it to our StringBuilder. This implies that the string may contain non-numeric values which need to be rejected, which means our length validation was still wrong. So either the data is clean and we're overvalidating, or the data is dirty and we're validating in the wrong order. But all of that's a preamble to a terrible abuse of string builders, where they discard all the advantages of using a StringBuilder by calling toString again and again and again. Now, maybe the function caches results or the compiler can optimize it, but the result is a particularly unreadable blob of slicing code. Now, this is ugly, but at least it works, assuming the input data is good. It definitely should never pass a code review, but it's not the kind of bad code that leaves one waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat. No, what gets me about this is that it took five days to write. And according to Nick, the responsible developer wasn't just slacking off or going to meetings the whole time, they were at their desk poking at their Java IDE and looking confused for all five days. And of course, because it took so long to write the feature, management didn't want to waste more time on kicking it back via a code review. So voila: it got forced through and released to production since it passed testing. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.
