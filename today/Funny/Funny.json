    "description": "There is something about businesses that allow random people to provide service to other random people, that is simply a recipe for disaster. Airbnb, Uber, DoorDash, etc – In theory, they are all great business models that allow people to make money without needing to maintain a whole business. Interested in becoming a taxi driver on your days off? Sign up for Uber. Want to rent out a unit no one is using? You don't have to register it as a hotel, you can just sign up for Airbnb. Simple as that.Except when it's not.The fact that these people are doing these 'side gigs', means that some of them are not 100% committed to it, and are definitely not committed to satisfying their customers. Because of this lack of commitment, customer service has to work overtime to ensure that people do not take advantage of each other, especially those who attempt to scam others for money.Take the Airbnb host as an example of someone who didn't really care about the business, and tried to scam people because of it.",

Internet, power, water, and gas are all a few 'luxuries' that get dealt with on autopay, deemed essentials to enjoying your living space to its full potential. So when your neighbor comes to try and reach into your home and your safe haven, they're risking the integrity of your hard-earned livelihood. With that in mind, when the stranger next door approached the guy in our next story about using his Wi-Fi password, he rightfully refused. Adamant about protecting his home's security and Internet integrity, he shut down the advancing neighbor.

But really though, marriage is a beautiful thing. It's the happiest day of your life, hopefully. It's also a very stressful day. For those of you who are married, you know the craziness that comes on your wedding day. You have a schedule that's packed tighter than a cat in a purrito, there is no margin for error and no time for any distractions.That is, unless, the cat distribution system knocks on your door. Imagine you're getting ready, your hair and makeup are done, you take your two-minute and 30-second break in the schedule to walk around and get some fresh air….and then you hear some meowing. Not just one meow, but four, eight, sixteen meows! Naturally, you investigate.

So, technically, it's less to worry about, because it's literally less of a thing in the cat. But on the other hand, the fact your orange buddy has yet to obtain the single brain cell all orange cats share creates other things you should worry about. Like the orange cat behavior. And yes, we're 200% sure that if you're an orange cat pawrent you know exactly what sort of behavior we're talking about. The orange kind.For everyone else who does not pawrent an orange feline friend, let us demonstrate it to you with the power of memes. We gathered some cat memes that demonstrate the power of a 0 brain cell orange cat to create silly chaos all around them. But it's not just the chaos, it's the… orangeness. And it's definitely great for meme material. It's no wonder this genre of cat memes is flourishing.",

I have sent him three to four hundred TikToks over the last six years or so and he just says he doesn't have it and will never have it.

    "description": "A Representative Line is a short snippet that makes you think, \"wow, I'd hate to see the rest of the code.\" A CodeSOD is a longer snippet, which also frequently makes you think, \"wow, I'd hate to see the rest of the code,\" but also is bad in ways that require you to look at the relationship between the lines in the code. I bring that up, because today's code sample is a long section, but really, it's just a collection of representative lines. Each line in this just makes me die a little on the inside. Belda found this: ## helper functions function stripmagic($x) { return get_magic_quotes_gpc() ? stripslashes($x) : $x; } function pre_r(\u0026$x) { return ''.PHSC(print_r($x, true)).''; } function PSS($x) { return str_replace('\\\\\"','\"',$x); } function PVS($x) { return preg_replace(\"/\\n[^\\\\S\\n]*(?=\\n)/\", \"\\n\u003c:vspace\u003e\", $x); } function PVSE($x) { return PVS(PHSC($x, ENT_NOQUOTES)); } function PZZ($x,$y='') { return ''; } function PRR($x=NULL) { if ($x || is_null($x)) $GLOBALS['RedoMarkupLine']++; return $x; } function PUE($x) { return preg_replace('/[\\\\x80-\\\\xff \\'\"\u003c\u003e]/e', \"'%'.dechex(ord('$0'))\", $x); } function SDV(\u0026$v,$x) { if (!isset($v)) $v=$x; } function SDVA(\u0026$var,$val) { foreach($val as $k=\u003e$v) if (!isset($var[$k])) $var[$k]=$v; } This collection of one-line \"helper\" functions has it all. Cryptic function names. PRR mutates global variables. PZZ just… returns an empty string. I don't know what PHSC does, and I don't want to, but it's called inside of pre_r and PVSE. Which I also don't know what they do. Speaking of PVSE, I note the regex is using backreferences, which is some advanced regex but I still have no idea what it's doing. I could figure it out, but I don't want to. PUE looks like it might be handling some misencoded characters, maybe. SDV is maybe kinda a coalesce function. Each line is its own representative line. None of this is code I'd want to maintain. On the flip side, the abbreviated function names, when read in reverse order, are exactly the sounds I made when I read this code: \"SDVASDVPUEPRRPZZPVSEPVSPSS\". It's okay, the doctors say I'll make a full recovery.

    "description": "Sawyer was talking with a co-worker about how their unique session IDs got created. The concern was that they were only five characters long, which meant there could easily be collisions. They started by looking at the random number generation function. Public Function RandomNumberGenerator(ByVal min As Integer, ByVal max As Integer, Optional ByVal numDecimals As Integer = 0) As String '*** the generates a number as a string Dim strNum As New StringBuilder Dim rnd As New System.Random Dim i, x, n As Integer Try i = rnd.Next(min, max) If numDecimals \u003e 0 Then Try strNum.Append(\"9\", numDecimals) n = CType(strNum.ToString, Int32) x = rnd.Next(0, n) Catch ex As Exception x = 1 End Try End If strNum.Remove(0, strNum.Length) strNum.Append(i.ToString()) If numDecimals \u003e 0 Then strNum.Append(\".\") If numDecimals \u003e 99 Then numDecimals = 99 End If strNum.Append(x.ToString(\"D\" \u0026 numDecimals.ToString())) End If Return strNum.ToString Catch Return \"1.00\" End Try End Function You always know it's going to be bad when you see the random number generator returns a string. If numDecimals is zero, the code is bad, but vaguely sane. Generate a random number using the built in functions, then return it- as a string. It's the use of numDecimals which makes this weird. We start by appending \"9\"s to our string builder, converting it to an integer, and then generating a random number from zero to whatever number of nines we're using. This is the code of someone who hates and fears logarithms. Then we clear out our string builder because we're starting over with the actual number. Then we append a \".\", then we append our number, formatted with our number of decimals string, which we force to be no larger than 99. And this is where we get the special kind of weird. When we're generating our random decimal number, we do this: strNum.Append(\"9\", numDecimals). This is going to put numDecimals 9s on the string. E.g., if numDecimals is 9, this would set strNum to be 999999999. Thus, when we generate a random number, we generate one between 0 and 99999999. But, when we append that formatted value to the string, we do this: If numDecimals \u003e 99 Then numDecimals = 99 End If strNum.Append(x.ToString(\"D\" \u0026 numDecimals.ToString())) Here, we're treating numDecimals as a format string. We're only ever going to output two digits. The only good news is that while this random function was used everywhere, it wasn't used to generate their random IDs. The bad news, this is how their random IDs. Public Function RandomQueryStringGenerator() As String '*** the generates an alpha-numeric string 5 digits long such as aa7bb Dim strPwd As New StringBuilder Dim rnd As New System.Random Dim i As Integer Try For x As Integer = 1 To 5 Select Case x Case 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9 i = rnd.Next(97, 122) If i Mod 2 = 0 Then strPwd.Append(Chr(i).ToString().ToUpper()) Else strPwd.Append(Chr(i).ToString()) End If Case Else i = rnd.Next(0, 9) strPwd.Append(i.ToString()) End Select Next x Return strPwd.ToString() Catch Return String.Empty End Try End Function [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.
