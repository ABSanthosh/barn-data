    "description": "When it comes to cats and family… there are always challenges. Hey, the Cat Distribution System only provides the cat to one human usually, so the rest of the humans in the house simply have to deal with it. Now, you always want things to end up well. And we have seen so many times dads who hated cats falling in love with them and moms who didn't like cats suddenly having a soft spot for them once the adopted kitty shows them affection. Usually, it's just a matter of time. Usually, when there is respect toward the cat and a desire for the cat to accept you, if you wait long enough, the kitty will warm up to you. But not here. Not in today's story. In this case, there was no respect for the kitty, no understanding, and seemingly, no desire for love from the kitty. And although usually, we want to give people the benefit of the doubt, this sister is not getting it from us this time.",

Well, we've always felt a special bond with this particularly cantankerous kitty, like our purrpetually dramatic and furrever brooding souls were just cut from the same kitty cloth. That's why, on this terrible Tuesday, we're presenting you with a cranky compilation of the best grumpy cat memes, in our purrsonal opinion.Don't take our word for it (it's not like we're expurrts on cat memes or anything - that was sarcasm, in case you didn't get it), scroll down and see for yourself. These aren't any old silly feline funnies, these are only for the eternally dark souls, the people who wear black in 100 degree weather, and who never met a storm cloud they didn't like.

    "description": "It's safe to say that a small number of people actually want to work for a living. If it was feasible, many folks would take to a life of leisure rather than get ready for the ol' 9-5 routine every weekday. Not to rain on anyone's parade, but this isn't how life works. Money (most of the time) does not appear out of thin air, and everyone works for a living to achieve some level of comfort or stability in their lives. Working is not \"embarrassing\", it's just the way life works. If someone in your family doesn't want a job because they deem themselves above that lifestyle, they should also be fine with having little to no income. If they expect you to front the bill for their beliefs, you have to nip that entitled behavior in the bud. For example, if your mother refuses to work (after having worked for years), you, as their child, have no obligation to help her with something that can be easily remedied. The daughter in this story is fed up with giving her mom money because of the lifestyle she chose to live with.",

    "description": "One manager is finding out the hard way that they were too hasty in firing a few of their teenage employees. As a manager, you have leeway to make some important decisions. A supervisor needs to decide if they'll pull in more employees to make a shift easier, or send a few home so that the business saves money. You might get handed responsibilities like counting drawers at the end of the day or supervising closing and opening shifts. However, the manager at this store just randomly took it upon themself to fire a couple of young workers… and the head boss was not pleased with that choice at all! Firing employees isn't something every manager can just decide to do. Just because a supervisor is having a bad day or decides they want to get rid of a certain employee, doesn't mean they're allowed to on any level. So when this person went to r/AmItheA****** to ask for advice about what they did, the internet swiftly told them how stupid their choice was, and pretty unanimously informed them that they were wrong. Next, check out some terrible birthday presents that people shared that made them shake their heads, like one person who \"got a check… for $5. It bounced and cost me $10.\"",

When he asked his peers, they were all surprised to see that the flag wasn't turning off debug logging. \"Hunh, that used to work. Someone must have changed something…\" Everyone had enough new development to do that tracking down a low priority bug fell to Jon. It didn't take long. const DEBUG_LOG = process.env.DEBUG_LOG || true According to the blame, the code had been like this for a year, the commit crammed with half a dozen features, was made by a developer who was no longer with the company, and the message was simply \"Debugging\". Presumably, this was intended to be a temporary change that accidentally got committed and no one noticed or cared. Jon fixed it, and moved on. There was likely going to be plenty more to find.

    "description": "Quality control is an important business function for any company. When your company is shipping devices with safety concerns, it's even more important. In some industries, a quality control failure is bound to be national headlines. When the quality control software tool stopped working, everyone panicked. At which point, GRH stepped in. Now, we've discussed this software and GRH before, but as a quick recap, it was: written by someone who is no longer employed with the company, as part of a project managed by someone who is no longer at the company, requested by an executive who is also no longer at the company. There are no documented requirements, very few tests, and a lot of \"don't touch this, it works\". And this was a quality control tool. So we're already in bad shape. It also had been unmaintained for years- a few of the QC engineers had tried to take it over, but weren't programmers, and it had essentially languished. Specifically, it was a quality control tool used to oversee the process by about 50 QC engineers. It automates a series of checks by wrapping around third party software tools, in a complex network of \"this device gets tested by generating output in program A, feeding it to program B, then combining the streams and sending them to the device, but this device gets tested using programs D, E, and F.\" The automated process using the tool has a shockingly low error rate. Without the tool, doing things manually, the error rate climbs to 1-2%. So unless everyone wanted to see terrifying headlines in the Boston Globe about their devices failing, GRH needed to fix the problem. GRH was given the code, in this case a a zip file on a shared drive. It did not, at the start, even build. After fighting with the project configuration to resolve that, GRH was free to start digging in deeper. Public Sub connect2PCdb() Dim cPath As String = Path.Combine(strConverterPath, \"c.pfx\") Dim strCN As String ' JES 12/6/2016: Modify the following line if MySQL server is changed to a different server. A dump file will be needed to re-create teh database in the new server. strCN = \"metadata=res://*/Model1.csdl|res://*/Model1.ssdl|res://*/Model1.msl;provider=MySql.Data.MySqlClient;provider connection string='server=REDACTED;user id=REDACTED;database=REDACTED;sslmode=Required;certificatepassword=REDACTED;certificatefile=REDACTED\\c.pfx;password=REDACTED'\" strCN = Regex.Replace(strCN, \"certificatefile=.*?pfx\", \"certificatefile=\" \u0026 cPath) pcContext = New Entities(strCN) strCN = \"metadata=res://*/Model1.csdl|res://*/Model1.ssdl|res://*/Model1.msl;provider=MySql.Data.MySqlClient;provider connection string='server=REDACTED;user id=REDACTED;persistsecurityinfo=True;database=REDACTED;password=REDACTED'\" strCN = Regex.Match(strCN, \".*'(.*)'\").Groups(1).Value Try strCN = pcContext.Database.Connection.ConnectionString cnPC.ConnectionString = \"server=REDACTED;user id=REDACTED;password=REDACTED;database=REDACTED;\" cnPC.Open() Catch ex As Exception End Try End Sub This is the code which connects to the backend database. The code is in the category of more of a trainwreck than a WTF. It's got a wonderful mix of nonsense in here, though- a hard-coded connection string which includes plaintext passwords, regex munging to modify the string, then hard-coding a string again, only to use regexes to extract a subset of the string. A subset we don't use. And then, for a bonus, the whole thing has a misleading comment- \"modify the following line\" if we move to a different server? We have to modify several lines, because we keep copy/pasting the string around. Oh, and of course, it uses the pattern of \"open a database connection at application startup, and just hold that connection forever,\" which is a great way to strain your database as your userbase grows. The good news about the hard-coded password is that it got GRH access to the database. With that, it was easy to see what the problem was: the database was full. The system was overly aggressive with logging, the logs went to database tables, the server was an antique with a rather small hard drive, and the database wasn't configured to even use all of that space anyway. Cleaning up old logs got the engineers working again. GRH kept working on the code, though, cleaning it up and modernizing it. Updating to latest version of the .NET Core framework modified the data access to be far simpler, and got rid of the need for hard-coded connection strings. Still, GRH left the method looking like this: Public Sub connect2PCdb() 'Dim cPath As String = Path.Combine(strConverterPath, \"c.pfx\") 'Dim strCN As String ' JES 12/6/2016: Modify the following line if MySQL server is changed to a different server. A dump file will be needed to re-create teh database in the new server. 'strCN = \"metadata=res://*/Model1.csdl|res://*/Model1.ssdl|res://*/Model1.msl;provider=MySql.Data.MySqlClient;provider connection string='server=REDACTED;user id=REDACTED;database=REDACTED;sslmode=Required;certificatepassword=REDACTED;certificatefile=REDACTED\\c.pfx;password=REDACTED'\" 'strCN = Regex.Replace(strCN, \"certificatefile=.*?pfx\", \"certificatefile=\" \u0026 cPath) 'pcContext = New Entities(strCN) 'strCN = \"metadata=res://*/Model1.csdl|res://*/Model1.ssdl|res://*/Model1.msl;provider=MySql.Data.MySqlClient;provider connection string='server=REDACTED;user id=REDACTED;persistsecurityinfo=True;database=REDACTED;password=REDACTED'\" 'strCN = Regex.Match(strCN, \".*'(.*)'\").Groups(1).Value 'GRH 2021-01-15. Connection information moved to App.Config 'GRH 2021-08-13. EF Core no longer supports App.Config method pcContext = New PcEntities Try ' GRH 2021-08-21 This variable no longer exists in .NET 5 'strCN = pcContext.Database.Connection.ConnectionString ' GRH 2021-08-20 Keeping the connection open causes EF Core to not work 'cnPC.ConnectionString = \"server=REDACTED;user id=REDACTED;password=REDACTED;database=REDACTED;SslMode=none\" 'cnPC.Open() Catch ex As Exception End Try End Sub It's now a one-line method, with most of the code commented out, instead of removed. Why on Earth is the method left like that? GRH explains: Yes, I could delete the function as it is functionally dead, but I keep it for the same reasons that a hunter mounts a deer's head above her mantle.
