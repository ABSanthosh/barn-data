    "description": "These construction workers got to do the funniest thing possible, all while doing exactly as they were directed! There are some jobs where you have to do as you're directed, no matter how dimwitted those orders may seem. You can push back, you can complain to your boss, and you can team up with your coworkers to try and get things fixed. But at the end of the day, someone above you has the final say, and their word goes.Construction is one of those industries. You might be surprised to learn that even in a really expensive building — 10 stories tall and filled with marble — big mistakes can happen. These construction workers noticed a pretty glaring mistake, but since their general contractor was known for his impoliteness, they just did as they were told. They got paid either way, and the general contractor was left fuming. That's malicious compliance for you! Check out the full story below. This construction worker also left a few interesting answers to questions in the comments, adding more information about the full project. Next up, read another construction story: this brother-in-law has been avoiding his family for over a decade after they \"borrowed\" his expensive equipment without permission: '[He's] putting money in the way of a family relationship'.",

There are a few things that can get us out of bed in the morning without fail: the smell of a pot coffee warming up, the sound our cats make right before they share last night's dinner with the living room rug, and the smell of freshly cooked cat memes. True, the first two have more of a visceral reaction, but a new batch of cat memes just fills our hooman souls with joy because we know, without a doubt, that we will be smiling and giggling all meowrning long.That's why we like to start our day by kissing our cats (yes, it's necessary) and enjoying at least 20 feline funnies before 9 AM. 19 is too little, we don't have that much time in the morning to scroll through more than 30 - so 20 is the sweet spot for meme consumption.

    "description": "Ah, the mystery that is a kitten. You never know, when a cat is still that small, exactly what they are going to turn into. And although most times, they just turn into regular ol' cats, that's not always the case. Sometimes, a kitten that is born tiny never grows bigger, and you find out that your kitty has drawfism and will stay small forever. Other times, the normal kitten you adopted doesn't stop growing, and you realize that you adopted a Maine Coon cat or a Norwegian Forest cat. And sometimes, like this time probably, the kitten you adopted grows and grows and grows, and all you are left with is… a regular cat that is just a little bigger than most. Not a Maine Coon, not a unique cat in any way. Just a big cat. And a big cat like this one is not something to be concerned about. It's something to celebrate, because although it means that the shenanigans will be twice as big, it also means that you will have twice as much cat to cuddle.",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/spaced-out-prefix",
    "description": "Alex had the misfortune to work on the kind of application which has forms with gigantic piles of fields, stuffed haphazardly into objects. A single form could easily have fifty or sixty fields for the user to interact with. That leads to C# code like this: private static String getPrefix(AV_Suchfilter filter) { String pr = String.Empty; try { int maxLength = 0; if (filter.Angebots_id != null) { maxLength = getmaxLength(maxLength, AV_MessagesTexte.Reportliste_sf_angebotsID.Length); } if (filter.InternesKennzeichen != null) { if (filter.InternesKennzeichen.Trim() != String.Empty) { maxLength = getmaxLength(maxLength, AV_MessagesTexte.Reportliste_sf_internesKennzeichen.Length); } } if (filter.Angebotsverantwortlicher_guid != null) { maxLength = getmaxLength(maxLength, AV_MessagesTexte.Reportliste_sf_angebotsverantwortlicher.Length); } // Do this another 50 times.... // and then .... int counter = 0; while (counter \u003c maxLength) { pr += \" \"; counter++; } } catch (Exception error) { ErrorForm frm = new ErrorForm(error); frm.ShowDialog(); } return pr; } The \"Do this another 50 times\" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in here. What really infuriates me about it, though, which we can see here, is that not all of the fields we're looking at are parameters to this function. And because the function here is static, they're not instance members either. I assume AV_MessagesTexte is basically a global of text labels, which isn't a bad way to manage such a thing, but functions should still take those globals as parameters so you can test them. I'm kidding, of course. This function has never been tested. Aside from a gigantic pile of string length comparisons, what does this function actually do? Well, it returns a new string which is a number of spaces exactly equal to the length of the longest string. And the way we build that output string is not only through string concatenation, but the use of a while loop where a for loop makes more sense. Also, just… why? Why do we need a spaces-only-string the length of another string? Even if we're trying to do some sort of text layout, that seems like a bad way to do whatever it is we're doing, and also if that's the case, why is it called getPrefix? WHY IS OUR PREFIX A STRING OF SPACES THE LENGTH OF OUR FIELD? HOW IS THAT A PREFIX? I feel like I'm going mad. But the real star of this horrible mess, in my opinion, is the exception handling. Get an exception? Show the user a form! There's no attempt to decide if or how we could recover from this error, we just annoy the user with it. Which isn't just unique to this function. Notice the getmaxLength function? It's really a max and it looks like this: private static int getmaxLength(int old, int current) { int result = old; try { if (current \u003e old) { result = current; } } catch (Exception error) { ErrorForm frm = new ErrorForm(error); frm.ShowDialog(); } return result; } What's especially delightful here is that this function couldn't possibly throw an exception. And you know what that tells me? This try/catch/form pattern is just their default error handling. They spam this everywhere, in every function, and the tech lead or architect pats themselves on the back for ensuring that the application \"never crashes!\" all the while annoying the users with messages they can't do anything about. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/too-many-red-flags",
    "description": "Fresh out of university, Remco accepted a job that allowed him to relocate to a different country. While entering the workforce for the first time, he was also adjusting to a new home and culture, which is probably why the red flags didn't look quite so red. The trouble had actually begun during his interview. While being questioned about his own abilities, Remco learned about Conglomcorp's healthy financial position, backed by a large list of clients. Everything seemed perfect, but Remco had a bad gut feeling he could neither explain nor shake off. Being young and desperate for a job, he ignored his misgivings and accepted the position. He hadn't yet learned how scarily accurate intuition often proves to be. The second red flag was run up the mast at orientation. While teaching him about the company's history, one of the senior managers proudly mentioned that Conglomcorp had recently fired 50% of their workforce, and were still doing great. This left Remco feeling more concerned than impressed, but he couldn't reverse course now. Flag number three waved during onboarding, as Remco began to learn about the Java application he would be helping to develop. He'd been sitting at the cubicle of Lars, a senior developer, watching over his shoulder as Lars familiarized him with the application's UI. \"Garbage Collection.\" Using his mouse, Lars circled a button in the interface labeled just that. \"We added this to solve a bug some users were experiencing. Now we just tell everyone that if they notice any weird behavior in the application, they should click this button.\" Remco frowned. \"What happens in the code when you click that?\" \"It calls System.gc().\" But that wasn't even guaranteed to run! The Java virtual machine handled its own garbage collection. And in no universe did you want to put a worse-than-useless button in your UI and manipulate clients into thinking it did something. But Remco didn't feel confident enough to speak his mind. He kept silent and soldiered on. When Remco was granted access to the codebase, it got worse. The whole thing was a pile of spaghetti full of similar design brillance that mostly worked well enough to satisfy clients, although there was a host of bugs in the bug tracker, some of which had been rotting there for over 7 years. Remco had been given the unenviable task of fixing the oldest ones. Remco slogged through another few months. Eventually, he was tasked with implementing a new feature that was supposed to be similar to existing features already in the application. He checked these other features to see how they were coded, intending to follow the same pattern. As it turned out, each and every one of them had been implemented in a different, weird way. The wheel had been reinvented over and over, and none of the implementations looked like anything he ought to be imitating. Flummoxed, Remco approached Lars' cubicle and explained his findings. \"How should I proceed?\" he finally asked. Lars shrugged, and looked up from a running instance of the application. \"I don't know.\" Lars turned back to his screen and pushed \"Garbage Collect\". Fairly soon after that enlightening experience, Remco moved on. Conglomcorp is still going, though whether they've retained their garbage collection button is anyone's guess.
