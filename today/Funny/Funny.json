    "description": "Okay friends, we're gathered here today to talk about the one subject we cat-lovers despise talking about - the rainbow bridge. Everyone has to cross it at some point, and although we try not to think about it, we know that a day will come when we will have to guide our sweet felines to the entrance. We are tearing up a little bit just thinking about it. However, this is our job as pawrents. We work every day to give our cats the best lives pawssible, up until this day comes. However, we also must remember that life is cyclical and when one kitty leaves us, that leaves space for another one to enter.After losing her soul cat of 21 years, one feline pawrent was going through it. We all know what it's like. But, one day, she went on an errand trip with her mother and came across a stray cat that was nearly identical to her recently passed kitty. Call it fate, call it luck, but whatever you call it, we think it was meant to be. Scroll down to read the wholesome story below (and maybe get some tissues ready, just in case).",

    "description": "We all have haters. Even if you try to live your life as a saint, spreading nothing but kindness wherever you go, there is always going to be someone who will have a problem with your existence. Yes, it's difficult to go through life without attaining a single hater, and so when that hater reveals themselves to you, it's best to think of it as a lifetime achievement. You must be doing something that's significant enough if someone else took the time to have an opinion on it. Be proud that you're doing something, at least!When we get a hater and they decide to make their problems a problem for you, that's where it gets tricky. One of the worst kinds of haters is a jealous one because a jealous person will do some outlandish things to see if they can get what they do not have. One girl faced that issue when her mom told the family that she would be changing her name to the same name that her daughter has. Sharing a name with your mom is one thing if it's a family legacy, but if your mom is taking your name to satisfy some itch inside of her? Now, that's a problem. See how this girl deals with it.",

    "description": "You rarely see revenge and generosity go hand-in-hand, but this disgruntled employee found a way to get back at his greedy ex-CEO, while also donating to the poor. Clothes are 100% recyclable. I'm a big supporter of thrift shopping for clothes or finding old gems in the donation bin. Just because someone wore a shirt or a hoodie before you did doesn't mean it's soiled forever! A lot of clothing has a whole new life after it leaves its original owner. Donated clothes can be a lifeline for desperate people in need, literally putting a shirt on their backs and helping clothe their new outlook on life. Funnily enough, the guy in this next story was excited to do his part to help the local homeless population after he was wrongfully terminated and denied his bonus. Instead of egging his boss's luxury car or slandering his ex-company on Linkedin, he decided to passively besmirch them by donating all of his company merch to the homeless shelter outside his office. With a recognizable logo like theirs, the executives were reminded daily who was representing their company on the streets.",

Real tourist shit, but I just never really played that way before.

    "description": "We got an unusual rash of submissions at Error'd this week. Here are five reasonably good ones chosen not exactly at random. For those few (everyone) who didn't catch the off-by-one from last week's batch, there's the clue. \"Gotta CAPTCHA 'Em All,\" puns Alex G. \"So do I select them all?\" he wondered. I think the correct answer is null.   \"What does a null eat?\" wondered B.J.H , \"and is one null invited or five?\". The first question is easily answered. NaaN, of course. Probably garlic. I would expect B.J. to already know the eating habits of a long-standing companion, so I am guessing that the whole family is not meant to tag along. Stick with just the one.   Planespotter Rick R. caught this one at the airport. \"Watching my daughter's flight from New York and got surprised by Boeing's new supersonic 737 having already arrived in DFW,\" he observed. I'm not quite sure what went wrong. It's not the most obvious time zone mistake I can imagine, but I'm pretty sure the cure is the same: all times displayed in any context that is not purely restricted to a single location (and short time frame) should explicitly include the relevant timezone.   Rob H. figures \"From my day job's MECM Software Center. It appears that autocorrect has miscalculated, because the internet cannot be calculated.\" The internet is -1.   Ending this week on a note of hope, global warrior Stewart may have just saved the planet. \"Climate change is solved. We just need to replicate the 19 March performance of my new solar panels.\" Or perhaps I miscalculated.   [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.

    "description": "Barry rolled into work at 8:30AM to see the project manager waiting at the door, wringing her hands and sweating. She paced a bit while Barry badged in, and then immediately explained the issue: Today was a major release of their new features. This wasn't just a mere software change; the new release was tied to major changes to a new product line- actual widgets rolling off an assembly line right now. And those changes didn't work. \"I thought we tested this,\" Barry said. \"We did! And Stu called in sick today!\" Stu was the senior developer on the project, who had written most of the new code. \"I talked to him for a few minutes, and he's convinced it's a data issue. Something in the metadata or something?\" \"I'll take a look,\" Barry said. He skipped grabbing a coffee from the carafe and dove straight in. Prior to the recent project, the code had looked something like this: if (IsProduct1(_productId)) _programId = 1; elseif (IsProduct2(_productId)) _programId = 2; elseif (IsProduct3(_productId)) _programId = 3; Part of the project, however, was about changing the workflow for \"Product 3\". So Stu had written this code: if (IsProduct1(_productId)) _programId = 1; else if (IsProduct2(_productId)) _programId = 2; else if (IsProduct3(_productId)) _programId = 3; DoSomethingProductId3Specific1(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific2(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific3(); Since this is C# and not Python, it took Barry all of 5 seconds to spot this and figure out what the problem was and fix it: if (IsProduct1(_productId)) { _programId = 1; } else if (IsProduct2(_productId)) { _programId = 2; } else if (IsProduct3(_productId)) { _programId = 3; DoSomethingProductId3Specific1(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific2(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific3(); } This brings us to about 8:32. Now, given the problems, Barry wasn't about to just push this change- in addition to running pipeline tests (and writing tests that Stu clearly hadn't), he pinged the head of QA to get a tester on this fix ASAP. Everyone worked quickly, and that meant by 9:30 the fix was considered good and ready to be merged in and pushed to production. Sometime in there, while waiting for a pipeline to complete, Barry managed to grab a cup of coffee to wake himself up. While Barry was busy with that, Stu had decided that he wasn't feeling that sick after all, and had rolled into the office around 9:00. Which meant that just as Barry was about to push the button to run the release pipeline, an \"URGENT\" email came in from Stu. \"Hey, everybody, I fixed that bug. Can we get this released ASAP?\" Barry went ahead and released the version that he'd already tested, but out of morbid curiosity, went and checked Stu's fix. if (IsProduct1(_productId)) _programId = 1; else if (IsProduct2(_productId)) _programId = 2; else if (IsProduct3(_productId)) { _programId = 3; } if (IsProduct3(_productId)) { DoSomethingProductId3Specific1(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific2(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific3(); } At least this version would have worked, though I'm not sure Stu fully understands what \"{}\"s mean in C#. Or in most programming languages, if we're being honest. With Barry's work, the launch went off just a few minutes later than the scheduled time. Since the launch was successful, at the next company \"all hands\", the leadership team made sure to congratulate the people instrumental in making it happen: that is to say, the lead developer of the project, Stu.
