    "description": "We were all teenagers once, right? Remember your first job? You were probably like 15 or 16 and it was probably at some fast-food joint or a silly little franchise shop like Claire's (I was 17 working at American Apparel), right? At the time you were probably thinking it was just the place that caused all the drama! Like, that kind of atmosphere is what made all of your fellow teenage employees argue and date. But now that you're olde, you've grown wiser and know the reality of it all. It was adolescence. Surprise, surprise! Teenagers are dramatic. The only people that might be news too are teenagers. It's the hormones and the fact that we're new to society, at least on a more independent level.  That being said, it's fun to reminisce about those times and that's why there are so many shows like Gossip Girl, Euphoria, or even Skins that are about teen dramas. So we could not read this Reddit post about some teen drama at a fast food restaurant!",

    "description": "Hey, new manager—haven't you heard? The workforce always knows best.Managers always come in thinking they have to prove themselves to the suits upstairs. Hungry for power and wanting to wield their new workplace capabilities, managers tend to step on the toes of the workforce, stomping down old traditions that were steadfast for a reason. Perhaps if the nitpicky manager in this next story had heeded the warnings of the senior paramedics he was attempting to control, he might have saved the company $1000s in overtime wages. These paramedics were no strangers to working hard. Regularly clocking 12-hour shifts, they'd come back from the field exhausted and ready to tap in their relieving EMTs. However, this manager seemed to think that the 30-minute \"gentleman's agreement\" that the teams had forged over the years was an entirely superfluous practice. But after abolishing it, the manager ate his words and found himself hemorrhaging cash every pay period in the form of absurd overtime hours.",

    "description": "Howdy, feline fam. We like to think that there is good in everyone here at I Can Has Cheezburger, but we also know that some people can't be reasoned with. We can be okay with some people not liking cats, we can be okay with people thinking it's okay to put pineapple on pizza, but we can never be okay with people who treat their pets like toys. Toys that you can just get rid of whenever they're no longer fun, without a second thought.When you adopt a cat, it is a 10-to 20-year commitment. You don't just get rid of them when they're no longer convenient. You made a pawmise to them to love and care for them their entire lives, and to break that promise is unforgivable. So, we understand this purrson's dilemma with the thread below. Their sister-in-law gave up her 3-year-old cat for adoption because it was too much with the cat and her two kids, and then two months later, adopted a new kitten.

It's unreadable, but also, it has some URLs grouped inside of a [] pair, but others which aren't, and why oh why does the {0} sigil keep showing up so much? Maybe it'll make more sense after we fill in the template? var url = string.Format(xxxUrl, \"\u0026\", xxxIp, srvUrl, productCode); Oh. It's an \"\u0026\". Because we're constructing a URL query string, which also seems to contain URLs, which I suspect is going to have some escaping issues, but it's for a query string. At first, I was wondering why they did this, but then I realized: they were avoiding escape characters. By making the ampersand a formatting parameter, they could avoid the need to write \u0026 everywhere. Which… I guess this is a solution? Not a good solution, but… a solution. I still don't know why the same URL is stored twice in the string, once surrounded by square brackets and once not, and I don't think I want to know. Only bad things can result from knowing that.

    "description": "Aaron was debugging some C# code, and while this wasn't the source of the bug, it annoyed him enough to send it to us. protected override int DoCompare(Item item1, Item item2) { try { DateTime thisDate = ((DateField)item1.Fields[\"Create Date\"]).DateTime; DateTime thatDate = ((DateField)item2.Fields[\"Create Date\"]).DateTime; return thatDate.CompareTo(thisDate); } catch (Exception) { return 0; // Sorry, ran out of budget! } } Not to be the pedantic code reviewer, but the name of this function is terrible. Also, DoCompare clearly should be static, but this is just pedantry. Now, there's a lot of implied WTFs hidden in the Item class. They're tracking fields in a dictionary, or maybe a ResultSet, but I don't think it's a ResultSet because they're converting it to a DateField object, which I believe to be a custom type. I don't know what all is in that class, but the whole thing looks like a mess and I suspect that there are huge WTFs under that. But we're not here to look at implied WTFs. We're here to talk about that exception handler. It's one of those \"swallow every error\" exception handlers, which is always a \"good\" start, and it's the extra helpful kind, which returns a value that is likely incorrect and provides no indication that anything failed. Now, I suspect it's impossible for anything to have failed- as stated, this seems to be some custom objects and I don't think anything is actively talking to a database in this function (but I don't know that!) so the exception handler likely never triggers. But hoo boy, does the comment tell us a lot about the codebase. \"Sorry, ran out of budget!\". Bugs are inevitable, but this is arguably the worst way to end up with a bug in your code: because you simply ran out of money and decided to leave it broken. And ironically, I suspect the code would be less broken if you just let the exception propagate up- if nothing else, you'd know that something failed, instead of incorrectly thinking two dates were the same. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.
