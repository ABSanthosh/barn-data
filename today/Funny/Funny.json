    "description": "Imagine this wholesome and gentle scenario - your cat approaches you with his tail perked up in excitement and his eyes blinking slowly, indicating he's here to love and to receive love. He snuggles up next to you, in his fluffy feline fashion, sending one of his front legs towards you and paws you gently. Isn't that just the cutest, most wholesome thing a cat pawrent can expurrience? Just a smol touch of a cat's paw. It can change a day's mood, it can make any humble hooman happy for a long time. It's like a tiny imprint of bliss.We want to help any hooman experience this meowgnificent moment, even if they're not cat pawrents - so we turned to the next best thing, which is also so easy to transfer to any feline fan - cat memes. And not just any cat memes - toe beans and paws. These memes are like a cat pawing at you gently, wholesome but full of humor all hoomans can harvest.",

    "description": "It's Tuesday, feline fam, and all we want to do today is curl up in our beds and snuggle with our cats all day. To be fair, that's what we want to do every day, but especially on this cold, wintery Tuesday. If we could pick our purrfect cuddle puddle, it would be with a family of cheetahs. It would be like cuddling with a great dane, but better, because it would be a giant cat that meows and purrs. Just imagine how soft it would be. Just imagine purrs from a 120 lb. cat…it must be meowgical. Now, multiply that by three, and you've successfully managed to expurrience what the hooman guard in this video gets to enjoy every night. He guards a family of cheetahs at a wildlife reserve, and while sleeping under the stars, the large feline family snuck in for a cuddle puddle overnight, showcasing the heartwarming connections pawssible between hoomans and animals. We're not just awwwww-ing over this, we're also pawsitively jealous. Scroll down to watch the wholesome video below!",

First of all, if you work from home, Fluffy is your coworker now, so get him on the call, pronto! Second of all, your pet is never a bother. Cats love to jump up on the desk and start rubbing themselves on your face at the exact moment you're trying to give an important presentation to your boss (it's like they know that they're choosing the worst possible time to do it!). Don't be embarrassed that Mr. Whiskers is getting in the frame, just embrace it! Now, your precious pet can mug for the camera while you deliver last quarter's numbers. You've instantly livened up the meeting! Congrats! However, that's not the only way you can liven up your coworker's video call experience and become the workplace personality hire. Just keep reading, and you'll find a bunch of stories about hilarity on video calls, for better or worse. Up next, read about the inexperienced traveling YouTuber parents who plan to sell their home, travel full time, and make $50k, in that order: \"",

After all, the gift of a vacation is not the opportunity for a business venture. Clearly, this one family thought differently when they invited their kid's friend to a trip to Costa Rica and subsequently charged the friend's parents for a significant portion of the trip without warning after the fact. Perhaps if the other kid's parents knew that this was always going to be the plan before the vacation, they wouldn't have allowed their daughter to go to Costa Rica.

Perhaps this is leftover code, where once upon a time there was a prefix or suffix on the string which needed to be ignored. But the result is code that is rather dumb. I call this an \"un-representative line\" because, according to David, the rest of the code in the extension was actually rather good. Even otherwise good code is not immune to having a little fart hiding under the covers, I suppose.

    "description": "Grün works for a contracting company. It's always been a small shop, but a recent glut of contracts meant that they needed to staff up. Lars, the boss, wanted more staff, but didn't want to increase the amount paid in salaries any more than absolutely necessary, so he found a \"clever\" solution. He hired college students, part time, and then threw them in the deep end of Perl code, a language some of them had heard of, but none of them had used. It didn't go great. # note that $req is immutable (no method apart from constructor sets a value for its members) sub release { my $req = shift; my $body = 'operation:' . ' '; if (uc($req-\u003eop()) eq 'RELEASE') { $body .= 'release' . \"\\n\"; # do more stuff to body ... } else { $body = 'operation: request' . \"\\n\"; } if (uc($req-\u003eop()) ne 'RELEASE') { register_error('unable to send release mail'); } # and so on ... } This method checks a $req parameter. Notably, it's not being passed as a prototype parameter, e.g. as part of the signature- sub release($req)- but accessed by shifting out of @_, the special variable which holds all the parameters. This is the kind of move that gives Perl it's reputation for being write only, and it's also a sign that they were cribbing off the Perl documentation as they write. For whatever reason, using shift seems to be the first way Perl documentation teaches people to write subroutines. This whole thing is doing string concatenation on a $body variable, presumably an email body. I'd normally have unkind words here, but this is Perl- giant piles of string concatenation is just basically par for the course. The \"fun\" part in this, of course, is the if statements. If the $req is to \"RELEASE\", we append one thing to the body, if it's not, we append a different thing. But if it's not, we also register_error. Why couldn't that be in the else block? Likely because the poor developers didn't have a good understanding of the code, and the requirements kept changing. But it's a little head scratcher, especially when we look at the one place this function is called: if (uc($req-\u003eop()) eq 'RELEASE') { return release($req); } Now, on one hand, having the function check for its error condition and avoiding triggering the error condition at the call site is good defensive programming. But on the other, this all sorta smacks of a developer not fully understanding the problem and spamming checks in there to try and prevent a bug from appearing. But the real fun one is this snippet, which seems like another case of not really understanding what's happening: if(($ok1==1 and $ok3==1)or($ok1==1 and $ok3==1)) { print p(\"Master changed!\"); } We just check the same condition twice. Now, of course, it's not the developers' fault that they didn't have a good picture of what they should have been doing. Lars was trying to save money by hiring the inexperienced, and as usually happens, the entire thing cost him more money, because Grün and the rest of the team needed to go back over the code and rewrite it. The upshot, for our college students, is that this was a good resume builder. They've all since moved on to bigger companies with better paychecks and actual mentoring programs that will develop their skills.
