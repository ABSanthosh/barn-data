    "description": "You can't pick your coworkers, and sometimes, it feels like the universe is playing a cruel trick on you with the folks management decides to hire. Whether you're a new employee facing the harsh reality of your new incompetent coworkers or you're a seasoned vet taking in the absurdity of yet another unfit new hire, you know this struggle a little too well. You might've gotten stuck with the colleague who swoops in at the last second and takes all the credit for your work, or the colleague who takes five to seven business days to reply to a simple email, or even worse, the office food thief who swipes your lunch like it's no big deal. But how do you handle a coworker who doubles as a litterbug? That's a new one.This story takes the office drama to the streets (literally) when one coworker decided to toss his coffee cup out the car window during while carpooling to work, completely disregarding the driver's plea not to. Instead of turning a blind eye, the driver put an immediate stop to it (again, literally). What followed was a cold, awkward, and very expensive journey to the office for the litterbug.",

    "description": "This bride caused a butterfly effect in her parent's lives after they missed their only daughter's wedding day. Sibling favoritism is usually a little more subtle than it is in this woman's family. In some families, it means that the parent will spend hours on the phone with one kid, while forgetting to even text another back. Or some daughters are the apple of their father's eye, but they just can't get along with their mom. There are a lot of complex family dynamics that contribute to this. And that's why for u/sh****-mom-throwaway, after years of tension, her wedding led to the entire family finally coming face to face with their blatant favoritism. Can you imagine missing your own child's wedding just because you didn't really feel like going? It's unimaginable to many parents: it's one of those sweet events that people really look forward to celebrating as the newlyweds usher in a new period of their lives. Not these parents, though: they treated their daughter's wedding as if she just invited them out for a casual coffee date, denying to show up at all! The story is quite long but well worth the read, as well as the update where things really started to change drastically for the original poster. Next, read about some other dramatic wedding moments, like one person who admitted that \"The tornado at the outdoor reception was kinda bad.\"",

Because everyone knows that for some reason, every year, cats decide to have a war with Christmas. Or maybe it's not a war. Maybe it's love that's making cats get inside of Christmas trees the second that they are put up. But everyone knows that love can lead to chaos, and the same is true for cats and Christmas trees.And so, another year, and the madness continues. It's only the beginning of December, and not all of us have put up their trees yet, but the ones of us who decided to start the party a little earlier than most are already experiencing the meowgic of Christmas, because cats don't care how early, they will get up on those Christmas trees and make sure that the party starts instantly.",

All of a sudden, we're wrapped up in giant, poofy coats, bundled up in scarves and hats, and wishing we were back inside underneath the coziness of our comforters (well, that's nothing new). With this cold winter weather and the sun going down earlier and earlier, we can't be bothered to go outside at all. In fact, we've been inside so much that even our cats are starting to get tired of us! That's why we've collected a flurry of feline funnies for you to pursue while weathering the cold winter winds (from the warmth of your own home).No matter rain or shine, snow or sleet, these cold-weather cat memes are sure to keep your hearts and fingers warm while any sort of storm rages outside. Now we just need a cup of hot chocolate to keep us company while our cats take up the whole heater. Not only is it the purrfect day to stay inside, but it's also the purrfect day to scroll through these feline funnies. Enjoy!",
