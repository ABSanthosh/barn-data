    "description": "These parents seem to treat sending their kids to school as more of a business transaction than anything else. Sure, if you're in the position to send your kids to an exclusive private school, you might want to ensure that wherever you choose to send them will be worth the hefty price of admission. However, for the vast majority of decent parents out there, any skepticism they may have about whether or not they are making the right choice is typically reserved to the school itself, not the capabilities of their own kid.In this instance, we have a couple who felt that their older daughter was a perfect fit for a private school due to her interest in STEM, while their younger daughter was unfit simply because she was more interested in the arts. From personal experience, I can confidently say that assessing whether or not your child is academically intelligent cannot be easily decided when they are in middle school. Students grow and evolve in surprising ways, and having a kid's parents limit their possibilities is nothing more than a discouraging sign.

    "description": "Coworkers are not friends, no matter how are we want them to be. At the end of the day, making friends in the workplace seems great in theory, but you'll soon realize that \"friendship\" looks like carpooling, and you're the only one actually paying for gas. Or, asking to switch shifts once or twice at first, then every week, then nearly every day. Not everyone is that entitled, sure, but it's better to be safe and set a boundary than be sorry you didn't tell them \"No\" the first time they asked to borrow 50 bucks from you.The employee who posted this next story is struggling to learn how to say \"No\" to their entitled coworker who has clearly realized they can take advantage of them one ride home at a time. Being kind and good is nice and all, but not when it starts to affect your life's quality. The employee is now at risk of losing their health insurance because of lateness they cannot avoid if they help their coworker out, but they don't want to be a bad person. PSA: Looking out for yourself is not you being a bad person, it's you putting yourself first. If you can't help yourself, how will you help anyone else? Scroll below to read the entire story.",

We educate them, we feed them, we clean their \"business\", we play with them, and they sleep in our house. They mostly sleep. So maybe instead of \"children\" we should call them our \"teenagers\". Yes, that sounds more accurate.So, gather around cat pawrents, and bring your cat children and cat teenagers with you. We want to present to you something you both can enjoy together - a whole bunch of cat memes. Cat memes aren't here only for us, humble hoomans, they're here for cats as well. So gather your cat children and let's dive in.We gathered some seriously funny feline memes for you and your fluffy feline friends. They're meant to be enjoyed by both intelligent apes like us, and fluffy felines like your meowjestic cats. Take it all in, the floofiness and the laughter, and the sheer hilarity that is cat memes.",

We called her \"Lil Cappie\" for short. But we're saying this so you won't be alarmed by the cute kitty in the post below, named \"Toast\". Honestly, we love that name, but we understand that some people think it's weird. We think it's beautiful, just like his story.Some EMTs turned into cat rescuers recently when they found him during a call. He turned out to be quite friendly and hitched a ride back with them in the ambulance. We're not sure who adopted whom, but now Toast is loving his indoor life and has even been employed by his new family. He received an official ID card and everything! And now, for the cherry on top, Toast has been adopted by one of the EMTs and taken to his furrever home. Don't think that that excludes him from showing up for work every day!",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/the-wrong-kind-of-character",
    "description": "Today's code, at first, just looks like using literals instead of constants. Austin sends us this C#, from an older Windows Forms application: if (e.KeyChar == (char)4) { // is it a ^D? e.Handled = true; DoStuff(); } else if (e.KeyChar == (char)7) { // is it a ^g? e.Handled = true; DoOtherStuff(); } else if (e.KeyChar == (char)Keys.Home) { e.Handled = true; SpecialGoToStart(); } else if (e.KeyChar == (char)Keys.End) { e.Handled = true; SpecialGoToEnd(); } Austin discovered this code when looking for a bug where some keyboard shortcuts didn't work. He made some incorrect assumptions about the code- first, that they were checking for a KeyDown or KeyUp event, a pretty normal way to check for keyboard shortcuts. Under that assumption, a developer would compare the KeyEventArgs.KeyCode property against an enum- something like e.KeyCode == Keys.D \u0026\u0026 Keys.Control, for a CTRL+D. That's clearly not what's happening here. No, here, they used the KeyPressEvent, which is meant to represent the act of typing. That gives you a KeyPressEventArgs with a KeyChar property- because again, it's meant to represent typing text not keyboard shortcuts. They used the wrong event type, as it won't tell them about modifier keys in use, or gracefully handle the home or end keys. KeyChar is the ASCII character code of the key press: which, in this case, CTRL+D is the \"end of transmit\" character in ASCII (4), and CTRL+G is the goddamn bell character (7). So those two branches work. But home and end don't have ASCII code points. They're not characters that show up in text. They get key codes, which represent the physical key pressed, not the character of text. So (char)Keys.Home isn't really a meaningful operation. But the enum is still a numeric value, so you can still turn it into a character- it just turns into a character that emphatically isn't the home key. It's the \"$\". And Keys.End turns into a \"#\". It wasn't very much work for Austin to move the event handler to the correct event type, and switch to using KeyCodes, which were both more correct and more readable.

    "description": "\"Boy, stringly typed data is hard to work with. I wish there were some easier way to work with it!\" This, presumably, is what Gary's predecessor said. Followed by, \"Wait, I have an idea!\" public static Object createValue(String string) { Object value = parseBoolean(string); if (value != null) { return value; } value = parseInteger(string); if (value != null) { return value; } value = parseDouble(string); if (value != null) { return value; } return string; } This takes a string, and then tries to parse it, first into a boolean, failing that into an integer, and failing that into a double. Otherwise, it returns the original string. And it returns an object, which means you still get to guess what's in there even after this. You just get to guess what it returned, and hope you cast it to the correct type. Which means this almost certainly is called like this: boolean myBoolField = (Boolean)createValue(someStringContainingABool); Which makes the whole thing useless, which is fun. Gary found this code in a \"long since abandoned\" project, and I can't imagine why it ended up getting abandoned.
