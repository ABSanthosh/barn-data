    "description": "If there's one thing any employee should study in their job contract, it's their company PTO policy! Make sure you know if you can save up some days that will roll over into the next year or if you gotta cash them all in before the fiscal year ends. Some folks make the mistake of thinking that they'll be rewarded for not taking any PTO, but just isn't the reality of most companies.You earned those PTO days! Getting paid for having a good time on a much-needed Christmas vacay is a part of being a corporate automaton! At least you're getting some benefits out of a 9-5…We know you're all ready for some chillaxing. It's that time of year when you can hop on a plane to warmer pastures and ditch the hats and gloves. If you've got any remaining PTO that won't roll over into the next year, you might be too late—there's always next year. For the folks who booked their vacays six months in advance, you know what's goin' on. While you're counting down the days to 2025, scroll through these well-earned PTO memes to get your head in the vacation mindset!",

    "description": "Just a few more weeks of forced holiday cheer at the office, and we'll be back to the grind of Q1, where fresh goals and new spreadsheets await. Honestly, as much as the holiday season is supposed to be joyful, it's mostly just exhausting. We're in the final stretch of the tax year, and we're barely running on fumes. Between holiday-themed potlucks, secret Santa gift swaps, and painfully awkward holiday parties, it's a miracle any actual work gets done in December.On the bright side, management usually does something nice for the staff during the holidays. Sure, we dream of a Christmas bonus, but we'd happily settle for a thoughtful gift or even a little extra PTO to use up before the ball drops. Not in this office. Nope, here the staff gets peer pressured—thanks to one very persistent coworker—to chip in for a collective gift for their bosses. But that's not even the worst part. The Original Poster (OP) in this story discovered that the coworker organizing the gift was also taking all the credit. Talk about a lack of holiday spirit. Luckily, OP wasn't about to let that slide. With one cleverly worded mass email, this greedy coworker got exactly what they deserved.",

    "description": "Happy sassy Sunday, cat pawrents! If there's one thing we know about our furbulous feline friends, it's that they bring a level of confidence and sass that the rest of us can only dream of. Cats don't just walk into a room - they strut with sass, their tail is perked up there, and the look? A look of sheer cat confidence. They don't ask for attention - they demand it with meows and purrs, snuggling up to your legs until you stop and pet them. And to be honest - we stan cat sass so much.This Sunday we're embracing that splendid, self-assured cat vibe with a comedic collection of sassy Sunday cat memes. We already know these memes are the best sassy memes - do you? Grab your coffee, tea, or catnip (we don't judge), and let these sassy kitties strut their way into your heart and speak for themselves in the matter.",

    "description": "Michael had a co-worker who was new to the team. As such, there was definitely an expected ramp-up time. But this new developer got that ramp up time, and still wasn't performing. Worse, they ended up dragging down the entire team, as they'd go off, write a bunch of code, end up in a situation that they couldn't understand why nothing was working, and then beg for help. For example, this dev was tasked with adding timestamps to a set of logging messages. The logs had started as simple \"print\" debugging messages, but had grown in complexity and it was time to treat them like real logging. This stumped them, as the following C# code only ever printed out a zero: DateTime d = new DateTime(); int timestamp = d.Minute + d.Second + d.Millisecond; Console.WriteLine(timestamp + message); On one hand, this is a clear example of not understanding operator overloading- clearly, they understood that + could be used for string concatenation, but they seem to have forgotten that it could also be used for arithmetic. I don't think this actually only ever printed out a zero. It certainly didn't print out a timestamp, but it also didn't print out a zero. So not only is the code bad, but the understanding of how it's bad is also bad. It's bad. Bad. Bad. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time.
