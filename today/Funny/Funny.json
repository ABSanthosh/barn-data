    "description": "Focusing on your kids' schooling and future is important, but it's easy to lose sight of the little things and moments along the way that are also important. Failing to nurture their unique skills and interests may cost them the chance to do something that they feel is fulfilling and rewarding and what they deem to be the success of their own lives. Also, pushing them too hard to be successful may be counterproductive and drive them into burnout, which takes years to recover from. Plus, we've spent the last 20 years pushing our kids into STEM degrees with a singular focus on success, and now some fields are so oversaturated it's impossible for new graduates to get jobs in the fields they have studied anyway without the proper networking and connections.Besides, there's nothing like accidentally giving your kid a traumatic memory on their birthday that they're going to remember for the rest of their life. And this uncle drew the ire of his sister and brother-in-law when he pointed out to his 16-year-old niece that he didn't agree at all with her parent's decision to abandon her on her birthday.",

    "description": "Doing human resources work isn't always serious. Sometimes, it can be very funny, as the people of the internet will tell you!  Though they're sometimes known as the company boogeyman, the human resources department is sometimes needed to step in and sort out employee relations. They have a broad range of job duties, from managing an office to hiring and firing to mediating employee disputes. This can result in some awkwardness at times. As these HR professionals can tell you, it can be very awkward to try and figure out which employee is the one stinking up the office with their BO or talking to an employee about wearing appropriate office attire. Still, these HR professionals managed to make the best out of their situations. U/sgy0003 asked people to share the \"most ridiculous/hilarious complaints you ever received,\" and more than 2,700 people replied with their funniest tales. One person had to deal with an executive assistant who claimed her high heels prevented her from walking to the copier. Another got in trouble for their drawing of a stingray! You can check out all of these very silly tales down below. Up next, read about what happened when this 15-year-old called out her Grandmother for constantly missing her school concerts, leaving the whole family reeling.",

The smell of turkeys in the oven, the cozy warmth of the fireplace, and our cats actually wanting to snuggle with us because there's a chill in the air (little do they know that we keep the thermostat low for this very specific purrrpose). These last two months of the year are filled with feline festivities, purrfect presents, and meowliday cheer. Even though we're still more than a month away from Christmas, we wanted to give you an early present, one that keeps on giving no matter what state you're reading this in: hissterical cat snaps.These silly snaps may remind you of the meowgic you feel when opening up presents on Christmas morning. But who needs Christmas to enjoy huggable holiday hilariousness? At I Can Has Cheezburger, we think that you should be feline pawsitively pleasant every day, so get on your comfiest jammies and run downstairs faster than a cat with zoomies to open up these cool cat snaps (giggle all meowrning long).",

There's a whole genre of content based on this phenomenon, a type of story that people title \"not my cat\" to capture those moments when cats simply walk into our lives and choose to stay. These cats may decide that you are now their adopted pawrents, or they may be a simple visitor in your home. Regardless, you have been chosen by them, and that means that you are now theirs. Which is exactly what happened in today's story. You, as the person here, will not know where the cat came from or what its purpose is until it decides to let you know about it. For the time being, you simply have a cat, and that's that.",

    "description": "Alicia recently inherited a whole suite of home-grown enterprise applications. Like a lot of these kinds of systems, it needs to do batch processing. She went tracking down a mysterious IllegalStateException only to find this query causing the problem: select * from data_import where id \u003e 10000 The query itself is fine, but the code calling it checks to see if this query returned any rows- if it did, the code throws the IllegalStateException. First, of course, this should be a COUNT(*) query- no need to actually return rows here. But also… what? Why do we fail if there are any transactions with an ID greater than 10000? Why on Earth would we care? Well, the next query it runs is this: update data_import set id=id+10000 Oh. Oh no. Oh nooooo. Are they… are they using the ID to also represent some state information about the status of the record? It sure seems like it! The program then starts INSERTing data, using a counter which starts at 1. Once all the new data is added, the program then does: delete from data_import where id \u003e 10000 All this is done within a single method, with no transactions and no error handling. And yes, this is by design. You see, if anything goes wrong during the inserts, then the old records don't get deleted, so we can see that processing failed and correct it. And since the IDs are sequential and always start at 1, we can easily find which row caused the problem. Who needs logging or any sort of exception handling- just check your IDs. The underlying reason why this started failing was because the inbound data started trying to add more than 10,000 rows, which meant the INSERTs started failing (since we already had rows there for this). Alicia wanted to fix this and clean up the process, but too many things depended on it working in this broken fashion. Instead, her boss implemented a quick and easy fix: they changed \"10000\" to \"100000\". [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time.

    "description": "Some time ago, poor Keith found himself working on an antique Classic ASP codebase. Classic ASP uses VBScript, which is like VisualBasic 6.0, but worse in most ways. That's not to say that VBScript code is automatically bad, but the language certainly doesn't help you write clean code. In any case, the previous developer needed to make an 8 element array to store some data. Traditionally, in VBScript, you might declare it like so: Dim params(8) That's the easy, obvious way a normal developer might do it. Keith's co-worker did this instead: Dim params : params = Split(\",,,,,,,\", \",\") Yes, this creates an array using the Split function on a string of only commas. 7, to be exact. Which, when split, creates 8 empty substrings. We make fun of stringly typed data a lot here, but this is an entirely new level of stringly typed initialization. We can only hope that this code has finally been retired, but given that it was still in use well past the end-of-life for Classic ASP, it may continue to lurk out there, waiting for another hapless developer to stumble into its grasp.
