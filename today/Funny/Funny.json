    "description": "Mint is one of those things that most people have positive impressions of, associating it with cool green colors, refreshingly fresh tastes and smells, and summer beverages. It even has its own ice cream flavor and is synonymous with fresh breath. Overall, most of us regard it as being almost \"friendly.\" But not gardeners and landscapers, just mention \"mint\" to them and watch them turn into one of those Mr. Incredible memes as they picture all sorts of nightmarish abject horrors caused by what is one of the hardest plants to remove from a garden or lawn once it has taken root, up there with enduring pesky persistence along with the likes of bamboo. It can even escape from pots it is planted in if that pot is placed on top of soil. Basically, you only ever plant mint intentionally if you have no idea what you're doing or really just like mint and want it to be everywhere.It can be frustrating being granted an impossible task, especially when you're facing some sort of punishment or fine for not completing it in time. That's what this homeowner found himself facing when his HOA was threatening to fine him for the brown spot he had on his grass. No matter what he tried, be it seed or sod, everything that was planted there would go brown and wither.",

Other times you reach rock bottom and it's actually just karma clearing the way to read her gorgeous face. Sometimes if you just sit tight after getting fired, you might be able to witness the most magnificent karma ever to play out in your life.  Take, for example, this lowercase karma that happened after this loyal employee was fired. He had worked there for over 10 years and loved his job. However, during those unprecedented times, the company decided he was \"redundant\" and all of the owner's family, with less experience, deserve to get the favorite parts of his job. So when he was fired, it was effective immediately and callous.",

    "description": "Abandoning a cat is one of the worst things that you can do to it. Your house cat is reliant on you. It doesn't know any reality except the one that you created around it. Your house cat wouldn't know how to survive outside on its own, the same way that you wouldn't know how to do it, because it has never had to. Abandoning a senior cat… that is simply cruel. A young cat might still have the time, the energy, the chance to learn how to survive outside, but throwing a senior cat out is pretty much telling it that it does not deserve to live anymore. And we don't understand why people do this. Senior cats make amazing pets. They are so affectionate, so calm, so sweet. The thought of our sweet kitty having to live out there, all on its own, looking for scraps, breaks our heart. So, we can only say thank you to the kind people in this video who didn't let this cat be in that situation any longer than it already was. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver.

    "description": "Aaron was debugging some C# code, and while this wasn't the source of the bug, it annoyed him enough to send it to us. protected override int DoCompare(Item item1, Item item2) { try { DateTime thisDate = ((DateField)item1.Fields[\"Create Date\"]).DateTime; DateTime thatDate = ((DateField)item2.Fields[\"Create Date\"]).DateTime; return thatDate.CompareTo(thisDate); } catch (Exception) { return 0; // Sorry, ran out of budget! } } Not to be the pedantic code reviewer, but the name of this function is terrible. Also, DoCompare clearly should be static, but this is just pedantry. Now, there's a lot of implied WTFs hidden in the Item class. They're tracking fields in a dictionary, or maybe a ResultSet, but I don't think it's a ResultSet because they're converting it to a DateField object, which I believe to be a custom type. I don't know what all is in that class, but the whole thing looks like a mess and I suspect that there are huge WTFs under that. But we're not here to look at implied WTFs. We're here to talk about that exception handler. It's one of those \"swallow every error\" exception handlers, which is always a \"good\" start, and it's the extra helpful kind, which returns a value that is likely incorrect and provides no indication that anything failed. Now, I suspect it's impossible for anything to have failed- as stated, this seems to be some custom objects and I don't think anything is actively talking to a database in this function (but I don't know that!) so the exception handler likely never triggers. But hoo boy, does the comment tell us a lot about the codebase. \"Sorry, ran out of budget!\". Bugs are inevitable, but this is arguably the worst way to end up with a bug in your code: because you simply ran out of money and decided to leave it broken. And ironically, I suspect the code would be less broken if you just let the exception propagate up- if nothing else, you'd know that something failed, instead of incorrectly thinking two dates were the same. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.

    "description": "In ancient times, Rob's employer didn't have its own computer; it rented time on a mid-range computer and ran all its jobs using batch processing in COBOL. And in those ancient times, these stone tools were just fine. But computing got more and more important, and the costs for renting time kept going up and up, so they eventually bought their own AS/400. And that meant someone needed to migrate all of their COBOL to RPG. And management knew what you do for those kinds of conversions: higher a Highly Paid Consultant. On one hand, the results weren't great. On the other, the code is still in use, though has been through many updates and modernizations and migrations in that time. Still, the HPC's effects can be felt, like this block, which hasn't been touched since she was last here: // CHECK FOR VALID FIELD IF FIELD1 \u003c\u003e *BLANKS AND FIELD1 \u003c '1' AND FIELD1 \u003e '5'; BadField1 = *ON; LEAVESR; ENDIF; This is a validation check on a field (anonymized by Rob), but the key thing I want you to note is that what the field stores are numbers, but it stores those numbers as text- note the quotes. And the greater-than/less-than operators will do lexical comparisons on text, which means '21' \u003c '5' is true. The goal of this comparison was to require the values to be between 1 and 5. But that's not what it's enforcing. The only good(?) news is that this field also isn't used. There's one screen where users can set the value, but no one has- it's currently blank everywhere- and nothing else in the system references the value. Which raises the question of why it's there at all. But those kinds of questions are par for the course for the HPC. When they migrated a bunch of reports and the users compared the results with the original versions, the results didn't balance. The HPC's explanation? \"The users are changing the data to make me look bad.\" [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.
