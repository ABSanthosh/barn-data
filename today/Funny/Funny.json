    "description": "We've all made the mistake of lending money to someone we shouldn't have. Funnily enough, the best-case scenario when we lend a bad individual money, is that they simply never pay you back. The worst-case scenario is something like what happened to the employee here.This employee shared on Twitter a series of texts between her and a coworker after she made the mistake of lending that coworker some money. Instead of it being a simple interaction of the money and a simple 'thank you', the entire situation got a lot weird, really fast. This coworker continued to flood this poor employee's phone with texts asking for more money, food, and rides. Even after the employee blocked her coworker's phone number, they kept finding new ways to ask her for more favors.Some of the texts that were exchanged between the two were shared in this Twitter thread, and you would not believe the audacity of this coworker, so scroll down to read them yourselves. After you are done scrolling, click here for another story of an employee who decided to crash the company dinner after getting excluded.",

    "description": "Every coworker has their preferred way of working, and part of collaborating in the workplace requires both parties to readjust in order to get the job done. This hotel maintenance worker wanted to be called when any little thing went wrong, even if it meant being called all the time for simpler tasks that other coworkers could rectify without him. This, of course, only made the work day more difficult and more time-consuming for the maintenance worker, but that's supposedly what he wanted.Now, when he was out sick for two weeks to recover from a surgical procedure, other coworkers inevitably had to step in so as to not bother him while he was getting better. When the maintenance worker returned to the hotel, he was infuriated when a small shower shampoo holder wasn't up to his standards in terms of how it was installed. He erupted at his coworker, who shared this Reddit thread, which prompted some much-deserved malicious compliance.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.

    "description": "When you're a cat pawrent, you always want to have the best for your fluffy feline friend. Sometimes, the best for your feline friend mean the best apparel you can get them. And when you're a cat parent to a distinguished gentlecat, wearing a black and white tuxedo fur for all times, you might want to have an expurrt opinion about a splendid splash of color you'd want to add to them. Matching a color to your tuxie might be a more challenging mission than you would've thought.A tuxie pawrent turned to the wisdom of the meowsses and asked - what collar color fits your black and white kitty the best? Other tuxedo cat pawrents shared their expurrt opinions to help a fellow feline pawrent in need. Some of them said bright colors should do the trick and complement their monochrome fur, but some suggested a black bow tie to complete the tuxedo look. Some even went above and beyond and recommended not just a collar - but a handkerchief, a bandana, and even a princess dress!",

    "description": "I had joined the Games Workshop fandom at the tail end of 9th edition. I started out learning standard Warhammer 40k and ended up choosing the Black Templars as my army. While attempting to learn that, I was shown Kill Team which of course I also bought a rule book for and tried to learn. Around this time I discovered they had a whole nother game called Age Of Sigmar with even more armies and so I had to check that out. Then they hit me with Boarding Actions and finally 10th edition. I think I blew some sort of fuse in my brain at that point and had to check out of all of it.  I never really felt like I had a firm grasp of the rules for any of those games. It was just too much too quickly.",

    "description": "...to know which way the wind blows. This week, it's been an ill one. Two of our readers sent us references to the BBC's reports on unusual weather in Bristol - one from the web, and one mobile. Maybe that will help you deduce the source of this error. Frist, Graham F. shared a screenshot of the beeb's mobile app, bellowing \"I know Milton is hitting the US hard right now but that's nothing compared to the 14,000 mph winds here!\"   Snecod, Jeremy P. confirms the story and provides some details from the web page. \"BBC weather is clipping windspeed making it look like it's only 5909mph and not 15909mph... At least they realise something is wrong.\"   Some anonymous American shared a snap of their weather station, which was worth a little chuckle. \"Whether you like it or not, it's the weather, sort of. And, no, this wasn't during the recent eclipse.\" It would have been worse if the crescent had been a \"sunny and clear\" icon, though, given the time of day that the snap was taken. All in all, I have to call this \"not an error'd\".   We had to dig into the surplus bin to pad out the theme with this pair from Stuart H. He opens with \"I can only assume that the forecast is for Hell or a point between the surface and the center of the Sun! I think I need to turn the aircon up a few notches.\"   \"And following on from the forecast on the front-page - it's even worse for the rest of the world!\"   Finally Eric K. reported a temperature extreme \"Hellfire or extinguished sun? My weather app seems unsure of which type of apocalyptic weather conditions we're currently experiencing.\" But I also note this represents an unusually high level of humidity. I haven't checked but maybe one of our readers will look up these coordinates and let us know which burg has been obliterated.   [Advertisement] Continuously monitor your servers for configuration changes, and report when there's configuration drift.

    "description": "Working at a company where the leadership started as technical people has its advantages, but it can also carry costs. Arthur is in one such environment, and while it means that management and labor have a common vocabulary, the company leadership forgets that they're not in a technical role anymore. So they still like to commit code to the project. And that's how things like this happen: if( this.idtoservice != null ) { sOwner = this.idtoservice.Common.Security.Owner; } else if( this.idtoservice != null ) { sOwner = this.idtoservice.Common.Security.Owner; } else if( this.idtoservice != null ) { sOwner = this.idtoservice.Common.Security.Owner; } This isn't one commit from the CEO, it's 4 different commits. It seems like the CEO, perhaps, doesn't understand merge conflicts? This particular bit of bad code is at least absolutely harmless and likely gets compiled out, but it doesn't mean that Arthur doesn't feel the urge to drink every time his CEO makes a new commit.
