    "description": "Safety rules are there for a reason, but some workers refuse to believe something until they see proof of it. If you're doing a physical task and it seems like there are all these irritating rules in place, I know it can be frustrating. It's easy to think you know better, and to just start doing things your own way. But with safety regulations, there's almost always a dark back story to go along with it. Someone was harmed by doing the exact same thing as you, and a rule was made to keep it from happening again. You'd think an older worker would know this just from lived experience alone… but not everyone is that bright. At least his coworkers didn't have to deal with him for long before the boss caught on. No one should ever have to work in an unsafe environment, and rules are there to try and keep everyone safe, not just the people who feel like abiding by them. Up next, read about the mother of 2 tween girls who demanded an airline passenger move to a middle seat: \"This is about needing to sit next to my kids.\"",

We literally spend hours each day scouring the interwebz for the silliest, craziest, funniest, and most bizarre feline stories to share with you, but we have never seen something like this before. We've written many stories about cats ending relationships, or troublesome felines disliking their pawrent's partner, but we've never seen a boyfriend take such dramatic action over the matter itself. He literally took matters into his own hands.His girlfriend's cat was marking his territory constantly all over his stuff. To be fair, it was an older, male cat, so these types do have the tendency to warm up slower to men. However, he lost three backpacks and a pair of shoes, so he decided that enough was enough. Fast forward to now, and the cat is in love with him. His girlfriend even complains that he now feels like \"his cat\". Scroll down to read the full story below!",

    "description": "Good meowrning fluffy feline enthusiasts. How do you like to start your day? Purrsonally, I tend to hit snooze a few too many times, but being the proud hooman of two smol chaos goblins disguised as cats, I never really get the chance to oversleep. These mini purring alarm clocks are always up and ready to start the day, usually by launching themselves off the headboard or knocking things off my nightstand. Who needs coffee when you have a calico tornado and a tuxedo ninja stirring up morning mayhem?Living with cats means accepting that your day will never start the same way twice. Some mornings begin with soft snuggles and sleepy purrs, while others start with dramatic zoomies and a toy mouse in your face at 5 AM. But we wouldn't have it any other way. Cats bring a unique blend of mischief and magic into our lives, reminding us to find the joy in small things and laugh at the chaos. It is what it is, and we wouldn't change a thing.",

    "description": "It takes a lot of time and effort to build a code base that exceeds 100kloc. Rome wasn't built in a day; it just burned down in one. Liza was working in a Python shop. They had a mildly successful product that ran on Linux. The sales team wanted better sales software to help them out, and instead of buying something off the shelf, they hired a C# developer to make something entirely custom. Within a few months, that developer had produced a codebase of 320kloc I say \"produced\" and not \"wrote\" because who knows how much of it was copy/pasted, stolen from Stack Overflow, or otherwise not the developer's own work. You have to wonder, how do you get such a large codebase so quickly? private String getDatum() { DateTime datum = new DateTime(); datum = DateTime.Now; return datum.ToShortDateString(); } public int getTag() { int tag; DateTime datum = new DateTime(); datum = DateTime.Today; tag = datum.Day; return tag; } private int getMonat() { int monat; DateTime datum = new DateTime(); datum = DateTime.Today; monat = datum.Month; return monat; } private int getJahr() { int monat; DateTime datum = new DateTime(); datum = DateTime.Today; monat = datum.Year; return monat; } private int getStunde() { int monat; DateTime datum = new DateTime(); datum = DateTime.Now; monat = datum.Hour; return monat; } private int getMinute() { int monat; DateTime datum = new DateTime(); datum = DateTime.Now; monat = datum.Minute; return monat; } Instead of our traditional \"bad date handling code\" which eschews the built-in libraries, this just wraps the built in libraries with a less useful set of wrappers. Each of these could be replaced with some version of DateTime.Now.Minute. You'll notice that most of the methods are private, but one is public. That seems strange, doesn't it? Well this set of methods was pulled from one random class which implements them in the codebase, but many classes have these methods copy/pasted in. At some point, the developer realized that duplicating that much code was a bad idea, and started marking them as public, so that you could just call them as needed. Note, said developer never learned to use the keyword static, so you end up calling the method on whatever random instance of whatever random class you happen to have handy. The idea of putting it into a common base class, or dedicated date-time utility class never occurred to the developer, but I guess that's because they were already part of a dedicated date-time utility class.

    "description": "When Steve's employer went hunting for a new customer relationship management system (CRM), they had some requirements. A lot of them were around the kind of vendor support they'd get. Their sales team weren't the most technical people, and the company wanted to push as much routine support off to the vendor as possible. But they also needed a system that was extensible. Steve's company had many custom workflows they wanted to be able to execute, and automated marketing messages they wanted to construct, and so wanted a CRM that had an easy to use API. \"No worries,\" the vendor sales rep said, \"we've had a RESTful API in our system for years. It's well tested and reliable. It's JSON based.\" The purchasing department ground their way through the purchase order and eventually they started migrating to the new CRM system. And it fell to Steve to start learning the JSON-based, RESTful API. \"JSON\"-based was a more accurate description. For example, an API endpoint might have a schema like: DeliveryId: int // the ID of the created delivery Errors: xml // Collection of errors encountered This example schema is representative. Many \"JSON\" documents contained strings of XML inside of them. Often, this is done when an existing XML-based API is \"modernized\", but in this case, the root cause is a little dumber than that. The system uses SQL Server as its back end, and XML is one of the native types. They just have a stored procedure build an XML object and then return it as an output parameter. You'll be surprised to learn that the vendor's support team had a similar level of care: they officially did what you asked, but sometimes it felt like malicious compliance.
