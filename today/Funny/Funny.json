    "description": "When you're starting off in a job you're often taught a procedure and told that that procedure needs to be strictly followed each and every time—no exceptions. You quickly learn, however, that \"strictly\" and \"every time\" are not only inconvenient but ill-suited to handling the abnormal situations that quite obviously need to be handled as exceptions to what the handbook has outlined.In fact, not only are there a whole bunch of fringe situations that take some critical thinking, but the process itself is horrifically ineffective and inefficient, and there are way better ways to do things. Of course, especially early on in your career, you're not being paid to make these decisions, and everyone seems to rather that you just didn't. Especially when you encounter one of these managers who is a stickler for the rules and needs to see a process followed to the letter. It seems like they're not paying attention every time you make suggestions, but they somewhat perplexingly have no problem paying attention once they see you going off script.This teen who worked bagging groceries at a supermarket showed their boss a thing or two about the nonsensicality of \"always\" following the rules as written.",

When you're on your way to work or when you're doing your daily errands, take in your surroundings a bit more closely to see if the architecture and structure of the places around you make any logical sense whatsoever. If you do this, you are likely to come across some amusing discoveries: a ramp that leads to nowhere, a public restroom designed for absolutely no privacy, or a poorly spelled plaque. You have to wonder how these flaws even came to be, if they're completely accidental or if someone is trolling all of us. Here is our latest batch of poorly designed structural flaws!",

Whether it's the majestic fluffball living with you (or, let's be honest, the one you pay rent to) or a sassy stray you spotted crossing the street, cats are universal emotional support creatures. Yes, all of them. All the time. Even when a stray ignores me like I'm invisible, the snub feels oddly validating and injects a little serotonin into my day.  That being said, my cat, whom I physically gave birth to and have definitely shared more meaningful moments with than most humans, is mine. That's not negotiable. Now, imagine someone walking up to your door, skipping the small talk, and asking for your cat on the grounds that their kid needs it more than you do. That's exactly what this neighbor did.",

    "description": "When faced with an information system lacking sufficient richness to permit its users to express all of the necessary data states, human beings will innovate. In other words, they will find creative ways to bend the system to their will, usually (but not always) inconsequentially. In the early days of information systems, even before electronic computers, we found users choosing to insert various out-of-bounds values into data fields to represent states such as \"I don't know the true value for this item\" or \"It is impossible accurately state the true value of this item because of faulty constraint being applied to the input mechanism\" or other such notions. This practice carried on into the computing age, so that now, numeric fields will often contain values of 9999 or 99999999. Taxpayer numbers will be listed as 000-00-0000 or any other repetition of the same digit or simple sequences. Requirements to enter names collected John Does. Now we also see a fair share of Disney characters. Programmers then try to make their systems idiot-proof, with the obvious and entirely predictable results.The mere fact that these inventions exist at all is entirely due to the ommission of mechanisms for the metacommentary that we all know perfectly well is sometimes necessary. But rather than provide those, it's easier to wave our hands and pretend that these unwanted states won't exist, can be ignored, can be glossed over. \"Relax\" they'll tell you. \"It probably won't ever happen.\" \"If it does happen, it won't matter.\" \"Don't lose your head over it.\" The Beast in Black certainly isn't inclined to cover up an errant sentinel. \"For that price, it had better be a genuine Louis XVI pillow from 21-January-1793.\" A La Lanterne!   Daniel D. doubled up on Error'ds for us. \"Do you need the error details? Yes, please.\"   And again with an alert notification oopsie. \"Google Analytics 4 never stops surprising us any given day with how bugged it is. I call it an \"Exclamation point undefined\". You want more info? Just Google it... Oh wait.\" I do appreciate knowing who is responsible for the various bodges we are sent. Thank you, Daniel.   \"Dark pattern or dumb pattern?\" wonders an anonymous reader. I don't think it's very dark.   Finally, Ian Campbell found a data error that doesn't look like an intentional sentinel. But I'm not sure what this number represents. It is not an integral power of 2. Says Ian, \"SendGrid has a pretty good free plan now with a daily limit of nine quadrillion seven trillion one hundred ninety-nine billion two hundred fifty-four million seven hundred forty thousand nine hundred ninety-two.\"   [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
