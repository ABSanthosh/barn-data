    "description": "It's no secret that a lot of employers in as many industries allocate more budget to hiring than they do to staff retention. This is a bit silly when you consider that large organizations will go on to spend tens of thousands of dollars on recruiting, onboarding, and training processes—in addition to value lost due to lost time and productivity of vacant roles. Though some of this cost is silent or not immediately apparent on the books and, in contrast, the idea of approving even half that money in the upfront cost of giving a raise is daunting. While this is an organizational flaw that often occurs, there are, of course, more intentional reasons why employers choose not to give their workers even deserved raises.Whatever the reason or cause, unfortunately, this ends up with a turnover of the most experienced staff who are frustrated at their own lack of advancement and pay that is falling behind the market rate, discovering that new hires are being paid more than them despite their experience and contribution.That's what this worker in a \"niche\" field discovered had happened when they learned that their employer of 3 years had hired a new hire at $30k more than they were currently earning. Frustrated, they found a new job as fast as possible.",

    "description": "We learned from a young age that you should be nice to the other kids on the playground. Share the bouncy rubber ball, don't pull a girl's pigtails, and include everyone in your fun games! That's how it should be in the working world–the adult world–because if you make an enemy on the blacktop, you might just get destroyed in the next game of dodgeball. This IT customer learned never to mess with their tech support crew after being a total buffoon on the phone. He was known for screaming at the guys who were just trying to help him troubleshoot his modem, but finally, after being placed with the same phone support guy one too many times, he snapped and decided to get some revenge. Frankly, I think this guy's sleep schedule became a little more precious to him after he got completely pwned by the dude he was used to screaming at–I guess now it looks like the phone is the only thing screaming at 2 AM… 3 AM… and 4 AM. Do you think he'll be nicer to his next customer service rep after this? You be the judge.",

We love them, you love them, people love them, even other animals love cats. Our cats make us better versions of ourselves, so why not spread all those purrfectly wholesome feelings around? Everyone deserves love and the opportunity to be a better person, so one correctional facility in Indiana took a chance, and it pawsitively paid off!They implemented a feline foster program that allowed inmates with good behavior to foster homeless shelter cats. Not only did the cats get a hooman to love them, but it actually increased behavior in the prison and reduced the amount of fights! Of course, we could have told you this would happen, but it's nice to see it happen in real life. Be the hooman your floofy, fabulous feline thinks you are. See more pictures below, and we hope your day is filled with lots of kitty love!",

    "description": "CATS ARE THE SILLIEST CREATURES. They blep and mlem constantly, while their face is stuck in a silly expression, staring out to the vastness of space and time. Cats get scared of thin air, jumping in a panic from seemingly nothing. And finally, cats get the zoomies, which is arguably the silliest instinct a domesticated princess can have.CATS ARE THE SMARTEST CREATURES. They always know what time it is right now, and their strict schedule actually helps us, humble hoomans, to keep track of our lives. Cats are fiercely independent and can take care of themselves. It's not that they don't love us, but they are definitely sharp and capable. And finally, they know their family - other hoomans and animals of the house - and they're very smart to know that they are part of something.CAT MEMES ARE THE SILLIEST SMARTEST MEMES. And this is why we love to celebrate cats' silliness and smartness with a big bunch of silly and smart cat memes. We love cats. We love how silly they are. We love how smart they are. We love cat memes.",

Just know that Magnus was a good boy who was just trying to warn his Dad about something very bad that was going to happen, but instead he ended up making his Dad super mad. Like…SUPER mad. There is a saying in the community that “Magnus did nothing wrong” and while I am not sure if that’s entirely true (he did after all destroy the magical wards that protected holy Terra from the Warp), I do think he had good intentions.",

In 40k, people fly around in huge churches that are so big there are people in the belly of them that think the outside world is a myth. They have Space Vikings and Space Vampires. Acquisitions Incorporated can hit some real drama precisely because it's incredbly goof troop for the majority of the runtime.

Have you heard about the new, hot encoding standard for 2024?!\" exclaimed Daniel , kvetching \"Well, if you haven't then Gravity Forms co. is going to change your mind: URLEncode everything now! Specially if you need to display some diacritics on your website. Throw away the old, forgotten UTF-8. Be a cool guy, just use that urlencode!\"   Immediately afterward, Daniel also sent us another good example, this time from Hetzner. He complains \"Hetzner says the value is invalid. Of course they won't say what is or isn't allowed. It wasn't the slash character, it was... a character with diacritics! Hetzner is clearly using US-ASCII created in 1960's.\"   Finally this week, we pulled something out of the archive from Boule de Berlin who wrote \"Telekom, the biggest German ISP, shows email address validation is hard. They use a regex that limits the TLD part of an email address to 4 chars.\" Old but timeless.   [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds.

    "description": "Matt needed to add a new field to a form. This simple task was made complicated by the method used to save changes back to the database. Let's see if you can spot what the challenge was: public int saveQualif(String docClass, String transcomId, String cptyCod, String tradeId, String originalDealId, String codeEvent, String multiDeal, String foNumber, String codeInstrfamily, String terminationDate, String premiumAmount, String premiumCurrency, String notionalAmount, String codeCurrency, String notionalAmount2, String codeCurrency2, String fixedRate, String payout, String maType, String maDate, String isdaZoneCode, String tradeDate, String externalReference, String entityCode, String investigationFileReference, String investigationFileStartDate, String productType, String effectiveDate, String expiryDate, String paymentDate, String settInstrucTyp, String opDirection, String pdfPassword, String extlSysCod, String extlDeaId, String agrDt) throws TechnicalException, DfException That's 36 parameters right there. This function, internally, creates a data access object which takes just as many parameters in its constructor, and then does a check: if a field is non-null, it updates that field in the database, otherwise it doesn't. Of course, every single one of those parameters is stringly typed, which makes it super fun. Tracking premiumAmount and terminationDate as strings is certainly never going to lead to problems. I especially like the pdfPassword being stored, which is clearly just the low-security password meant to be used for encrypting a transaction statement or similar: \"the last 4 digits of your SSN\" or whatever. So I guess it's okay that it's being stored in the clear in the database, but also I still hate it. Do better! In any case, this function was called twice. Once from the form that Matt was editing, where every parameter was filled in. The second time, it was called like this: int nbUpdates = incoming.saveQualif(docClass, null, null, null, null, null, multiDeal, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null); As tempted as Matt was to fix this method and break it up into multiple calls or change the parameters to a set of classes or anything better, he was too concerned about breaking something and spending a lot of time on something which was meant to be a small, fast task. So like everyone who'd come before him, he just slapped in another parameter, tested it, and called it a day. Refactoring is a problem for tomorrow's developer.
