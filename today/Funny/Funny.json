What do you do if you see a child in your life getting bullied? Well, in the case of this Reddit story, you just have to call your grandma! We find petty revenge stories online all the time, but this one is definitely the most wholesome. Here we see a grandmother coming to the rescue of her 14-year-old grandson. She writes that they have always had a strong and healthy bond and she very much enjoys spending time with him. Even now as a teenager, they are close. So when she went to his sport event, he was extremely happy to see her! He went and gave her a big happy hug and that's when his bully decided to strike. The bully started to tease him for hugging his own grandma. So what did the grandma do? She called the bully over in front of everyone because with all the ruckus he was causing, it was obvious he needed a grandma hug too! It really put him in his place and all of the other kids he bullied where happy to see this grandma show the bully what's up. Read the entire wholesome showdown below!",

    "description": "Any job that even slightly requires employees to have a car in order to do the job, should physically provide a car for said employees. If you cannot do the job without one, there is no reason why the responsibility of getting a car should be on you. However, because companies today are cheap and will do anything to avoid spending more money, they will never offer that option to employees without being prompted. If there's nothing to stop them, they will even go as far as making employee spend their personal money for the company's benefit. Unfortunately, some employees would fall for it and agree to these terrible terms, while others would refuse and risk losing their jobs.The employee in this Reddit story not only risked their job, but they actually lost it after refusing to sell their personal car to buy a car more suitable for their line of work. Why would a company care what type of car you drive to work with?

Are our cats calmly napping by our feet the entire night? Or are our cats causing chaos all night the way that they know they are not allowed to during the day? Either option is pawssible, but really, curious as we have been, we have not had any serious reason to put up cameras and film our cats in the middle of the night. This couple definitely had a reason. When you are spending your nights having a hard time sleeping, and you think that maybe - just maybe - there is a chance that your cat is somehow at fault, then yeah, it's time to set up a camera and see what's up. And what was up here, in this couple's case, was both hilarious and adorable at the same time.",

    "description": "Phil's company hired a contractor. It was the typical overseas arrangement: bundle up a pile of work, send it off to another timezone, receive back terrible code, push back during code review, then the whole thing blows up when the contracting company pushes back about how while the code review is in the contract if you're going to be such sticklers about it, they'll never deliver, and then management steps in and says, \"Just keep the code review to style comments,\" and then it ends up not mattering anyway because the contractor assigned to the contract leaves for another contracting company, and management opts to use the remaining billable hours for a new feature instead of finishing the inflight work, so you inherit a half-finished pile of trash and somehow have to make it work. Like I said, pretty standard stuff. Phil found this construct scattered all over the codebase: if cond1 and cond2: pass elif cond1 or cond2: # do actual work I hesitate to post this, because what we're looking at is just an attempt at doing a xor operation. And it's not wrong- it's an if statement way of writing (not a and b) or (a and not b). And if we're being nit-picky, while Python has a xor operator, it's technically a bitwise xor, so I could see someone not connecting that they could use it in this case- cond1 ^ cond2 would work just fine, so long as both conditions are actual booleans. But Python often uses non-boolean comparisons, like: text = \"\" if text: print(\"This won't print.\") This is playing with truthiness, and the problem here is that you can't use a xor to chain these conditions together. if text ^ otherText: # do stuff That's a runtime error, as the ^ is only defined for integral types. You'd have to write: if bool(text) ^ bool(otherText): # do stuff So, would it have been better to use one of the logical equivalences for xor? Certainly. Would it have been even better to turn that equivalence into a function so you could actually call a xor function? Absolutely. But I also can't complain too much about this one. I hate it, don't get me wrong, but it's not a trainwreck. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.
