    "description": "When you're existing in a shared space with others, common courtesy is to keep the environment clean. That's like, a universal understanding. Or at least it should be. Make sure to wipe down the spills you cause, sweep up the crumbs from your Taco Tuesday, and ensure that everyone else is doing the same thing. Easier said than done, though. Especially when other people expect you to clean up after them instead of doing it themselves. That's when petty revenge comes in handy!The employee who posted this story had enough of their entitled, messy coworker and the ways in which they wouldn't clean up after themselves in their shared office kitchen. After several attempts to tame the messy bull, the employee decides to take matters into their own hands. Instead of continuously nagging their colleague, they unplug the microwave and put a makeshift \"out of service\" sign on the appliance. Now, this employee will never use the microwave again. It is unclear if others in the office were onto the employee's petty shenanigans, but at least the microwave was kept clean for all to use except for their entitled coworker with a cleaning aversion.",

    "description": "Many people are aware that roughly 40% of marriages end in divorce. But that doesn't deter most lovebirds from going to the alter. They're not pondering divorces, they're celebrating their love and thinking, \"Divorce happens to other people's marriages. My spouse and I will beat the odds, love each other forever, and figure out a way to make any disagreement work out.\" But as much as a couple tries to make their relationship work, there are issues that can't be fixed, and sometimes people end up happier on their own. Some couples even joke that their relationships improve once they split up, but it's kind of true. Sure, there's the heartbreak and woes, yada yada yada. The good news? You get to sleep in a bed by yourself, eat whatever you want whenever you want, no one is monitoring your finances or hobbies, and you won't have the stressors that caused the breakup in the first place. You can see your friends more than before, maybe get a pet or two, and there's nothing like a fresh start in your own house or apartment to make you feel brand new again.",

To be fair, that's what we want to do every day, but especially on this cold, wintery Tuesday. If we could pick our purrfect cuddle puddle, it would be with a family of cheetahs. It would be like cuddling with a great dane, but better, because it would be a giant cat that meows and purrs. Just imagine how soft it would be. Just imagine purrs from a 120 lb. cat…it must be meowgical. Now, multiply that by three, and you've successfully managed to expurrience what the hooman guard in this video gets to enjoy every night. He guards a family of cheetahs at a wildlife reserve, and while sleeping under the stars, the large feline family snuck in for a cuddle puddle overnight, showcasing the heartwarming connections pawssible between hoomans and animals. We're not just awwwww-ing over this, we're also pawsitively jealous. Scroll down to watch the wholesome video below!",

    "description": "Keige inherited some code which seems to be part of a drawing application. It can load brush textures from image files- at least, sometimes it can. static public Brush GetImageBrush(string serviceCode, string imageName, string language) { Brush BorderChannelGroupBrush; BitmapImage image = null; int point = imageName.LastIndexOf('.'); string languageImagename = imageName.Substring(0, point) + \"-\" + language + imageName.Substring(point); try { image = FrameWork.ServicePageImageUrlOnContentServer(serviceCode, languageImagename); } catch { } if (image == null) { try { image = FrameWork.ServicePageImageUrlOnContentServer(serviceCode, imageName); } catch { } } if (image != null) { BorderChannelGroupBrush = new ImageBrush(image); } else { BorderChannelGroupBrush = Brushes.White; } return BorderChannelGroupBrush; } There are a lot of interesting \"choices\" made in this code. First, there's the old \"find the last '.'\" approach of grabbing the file extension. Which is fine, but there's a built-in which handles cases like when there isn't an extension better. I think, in this case, it probably doesn't hurt anything. But the real fun starts with our first attempt at loading our image. We jam a localized language string in the middle of the file name (foo-en.jpg), and try and fetch that from the server. If this fails, it throws an exception… which we ignore. But we don't fully ignore it! If the exception was thrown, image doesn't get set, so it's still null. So we do a null check, and repeat our empty exception handler. If the image is still null after that, we default to a \"Brushes.White\" image. It's all a very awkward and weird way to handle errors. The null checks bring with them the whiff of a C programmer checking return codes, but I don't actually think that's what happened here. I think this was just someone not fully understanding the problem they were trying to solve or the tools available to them. Or maybe they just really didn't want to deal with nesting. It's hardly the worst code, but it does just leave me feeling weird when I look at it.

    "description": "David was integrating a new extension into their ecommerce solution, and found this un-representative line: $this-\u003emodel_sale_manageorder-\u003eexportOrder(substr($selectid,0,strlen($selectid)-1)); Note the use of substr- we take the substr of $selectid from 0 to strlen($selectid)- aka, we take the entire string. Perhaps this is leftover code, where once upon a time there was a prefix or suffix on the string which needed to be ignored. But the result is code that is rather dumb. I call this an \"un-representative line\" because, according to David, the rest of the code in the extension was actually rather good. Even otherwise good code is not immune to having a little fart hiding under the covers, I suppose.
