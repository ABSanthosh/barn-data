    "description": "Caturday is over, Monday is looming in front of us, but we have to stay pawsitive. We have to remind ourselves that the weekend is not yet over. There is still time left to see all the hilarious cat memes that you missed. Sunday, as far as we are concerned, is just another extension to Caturday. And really, any day can be Caturday if you just try hard enough. So, just as we start Caturdays with feline funnies, so will we start this Sunday, because it's just the right thing to do. So, take a minute. Forget all the things that you were worrying about a second before. While you are here, on ICHC, you must be focused on the silly cat memes. All it takes to forget your worries is a few minutes of investing in yourself, which is exactly what you are about to do right now. The rest can wait. Right now, the next five minutes are all about loving yourself and doing something that is good for your soul.",

We don't know how anyone could ever abandon a cat - it seems purrfeclty inhoomane to us, but then again, we have no idea what is going on in people's lives. But this cat isn't just any cat, it's a maine coon - one of the most regal and beautiful cats in the whole wide world. Well, if they don't want him, that's one more maine coon that we can take into our fluffy family, right?This floofball below is called Desmond and he was abandoned at the emergency vet for people to find him. The vets got him checked and cleaned up, but the abandonment left an emotional mark on him. However, things all started to turn around when he and one of the workers at the emergency vet made a meowrvelous connection with this maine coon. Long story short, they're going to adopt him, and now he's going to be treated like the purrfect prince he is for the rest of his days!",

It's not an existential crisis; he's just passing through that adorable phase where all they say is \"why?\"—like a toddler trying to make sense of a very messy world.Now, sweetie, let's break it down for you. Elon Musk is the richest man in the world. and billionaires can do whatever they want. Why? because, well, they're billionaires. Why? Because that's just system we all agreed to. Why? Because let's stop right there.But when you, a regular software engineer, want to have a second remote job? Oh dear, that's a different story altogether.

    "description": "Whether you're a workplace rookie or a veteran employee, sometimes it's difficult to discern the glaring red flags toxic managers spell out for you as if they're waiting to get reported. In every line of work, every industry, and every floor of an office building, several employees have bizarre personality traits that directly (and negatively) affect colleagues and employees. These employees, however, don't care. Why? They have a higher title to protect them from any real retribution. Coming to terms with the fact that you're reporting to a narcissistic manager might be a bit difficult at first, but as you'll read in the discussion below, it gets easier with time. The current job market doesn't allow us to be picky most of the time, but knowing how to combat (or drown out) a toxic manager's gameplay is the first step in leaving for greener pastures. Below, you'll read about the moments employees realized their boss was majorly toxic. Scroll below.",

I don't think there is one for English. \"To Whom It May Concern\" is probably the best we can do.   \"A coworker shared this phishing email he got,\" reported Adam R. \"Even the scammers have trouble with their email templating variable names too.\" (It's there at the end).   Mathematically-minded Marcel V. thinks these numbers don't figure. \"The update process of my Overwatch game left me wondering.

    "description": "Kirill writes: I've worked in this small company for a year, and on a daily basis I've come across things that make my eyes sink back into their sockets in fear, but mostly I've been too busy fixing them to post anything. It being my last day however, here's a classic We'll take this one in parts. First, every element of the UI the user can navigate to is marked with an enum, defined thus: enum UiItem { SectionA, SectionB, SectionC,...SectionG } These names are not anonymized, so already I hate it. But it's the next enum that starts my skin crawling: enum SecurityUiItem { SectionA = UiItem.SectionA, SectionB = UiItem.SectionB, ... SectionG = UiItem.SectionG } A SecurityUiItem is a different type, but the values are identical to UiItem. These enums are used when trying to evaluate role-based permissions for access, and that code looks like this: if ((currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionA) \u0026\u0026 currentAccess[SecurityUiItem.SectionA] != AccessLevel.NoAccess)) return UiItem.SectionA; else if (!currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionB) || (currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionB) \u0026\u0026 currentAccess[SecurityUiItem.SectionB] != AccessLevel.NoAccess)) return UiItem.SectionB; else if (!currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionC) || (currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionC) \u0026\u0026 currentAccess[SecurityUiItem.SectionC] != AccessLevel.NoAccess)) return UiItem.SectionC; ..... else if (!currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionG) || (currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionG) \u0026\u0026 currentAccess[SecurityUiItem.SectionG] != AccessLevel.NoAccess)) return UiItem.SectionG; else return UiItem.Unknown; Honestly, I don't hate the idea of having one data type representing the actual UI objects and a separate data type which represents permissions, and having a function which can map between these two things. But this is a perfect example of a good idea executed poorly. I also have to wonder about the fall-through pattern. If I have access to SectionA, I only seem to get SectionA out of this function. Are these permissions hierarchical? I have no idea, but I suspect there's a WTF underpinning this whole thing. Congratulations on Kirill's last day. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.
