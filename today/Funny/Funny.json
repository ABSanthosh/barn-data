    "description": "Working at a company where the leadership started as technical people has its advantages, but it can also carry costs. Arthur is in one such environment, and while it means that management and labor have a common vocabulary, the company leadership forgets that they're not in a technical role anymore. So they still like to commit code to the project. And that's how things like this happen: if( this.idtoservice != null ) { sOwner = this.idtoservice.Common.Security.Owner; } else if( this.idtoservice != null ) { sOwner = this.idtoservice.Common.Security.Owner; } else if( this.idtoservice != null ) { sOwner = this.idtoservice.Common.Security.Owner; } This isn't one commit from the CEO, it's 4 different commits. It seems like the CEO, perhaps, doesn't understand merge conflicts? This particular bit of bad code is at least absolutely harmless and likely gets compiled out, but it doesn't mean that Arthur doesn't feel the urge to drink every time his CEO makes a new commit.

Here we have loop unrolling taken to a new, ridiculous extent. The loop is executed in PHP, and \"rendered\" in JavaScript, outputting a huge pile of array assignments. Worse than that, even the name of the variable is generated in PHP- group_Arr_. This pattern was used everywhere, and sometimes I wouldn't even call it a pattern- huge blocks of code were copy/pasted with minor modifications. This pile of spaghetti was, as you can imagine, difficult to understand or modify. But here's the scary part: it was remarkably bug free. The developer responsible for this had managed to do this everywhere, and it worked. Reliably. Any other developer who tried to change it ended up causing a cascade of failures that meant weeks of debugging to make what felt like should be minor changes, but in the state which ALicia inherited it, everything worked.

    "description": "Ben's web firm took on a new client, and they're using a rather questionable shopping cart system. Like a lot of PHP web plugins, someone decided that they needed to \"protect\" their code by obfuscating it. Either that, they were obfuscating it out of shame, one or the other. if(!function_exists(\"cache_exists\")) { eval(\"fu\" . \"nction cach\" . \"e_exi\" . \"sts(\\$Data) { echo base\" . \"64\" . \"_d\" . \"eco\" . \"de(\\$\" . \"Data); }\"); } It seems like they specifically chose an \"obfuscation\" method which makes it hard to CTRL+F through the code- a search for \"cache_exists\" won't find the function definition. It'll find the line right before the function definition, where the code is checking to see if the function already exists, but it won't find the function. But let's talk about what the function does. It echoes into the page body the base-64 decoded version of whatever was in $Data. This alone gives me so many questions. What is in $Data? How does this relate to caching? Why are we just echoing the raw contents of a variable? What is this even for? Given that we do a function_exists check, I have a dark suspicion that there are multiple possible definitions of the function. This is the stub one that doesn't rely on reading from a cache and sorta doesâ¦ almost nothing? But in other circumstances, there are other versions which are actually returning whether or not an entry is in the cache. This is just a guess, as Ben didn't supply that information, but everything about this makes me Concernedâ¢.

    "description": "The power of exception handling is that it allows every layer in our stack be notified of an error condition, do something about it, and pass it on if necessary. For example, if you have a data access layer and a query fails, you may catch the exception and potentially retry there, only passing the exception up the stack after a few failures. Or, you may fail to connect, updates some internal status variables to represent that you're in an invalid state, and then pass that exception up the stack. There are other options one might use for propagating errors, but many languages use structure exception handling. Which brings us to today's anonymous submission, which is more of a representative comment than a representative line. This was in the public interface to the data access layer in a project: // error handling for this class occurs in the functions that call them.. This comment is half true. It's true in that the data access layer doesn't do a single bit of exception handling. It's false, in that the functions which call them also don't do any exception handling, unless you count \"letting the exception bubble to the top of the stack and cause the program to fail\" as \"exception handling\". There wasn't a single try/catch in the entire project. [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands. Download today!",

    "description": "Alexander doesn't usually ask \"why are you hiring for this position?\" during an interview. But when a small public library is paying your rather high contracting rate, one can't help but wonder. Fortunately, the library offered their reasoning without Alexander asking: \"We hired a new staff member, so we need a programmer to add them to our home page.\" Alexander assumed that he was dealing with a client who couldn't figure out how to navigate their CMS, and scheduled an afternoon to do the work. It turned out to be a bit more complicated. The site had an \"email a staff member\" form. Select a staffer from a drop down, type into a text box, and hit send. Not a single staff member had ever received an email through the interface, but they all agreed it was a good feature to have, even if no one used it. The relationship between staff members and email addresses was stored in a database. I'm kidding, why would you use a database for that? It was stored in a PHP file called mail_addresses.php: /* please maintain alphabetical order */ $name=array('Alex'=\u003e'alex@library.com', /* snip a few lines here */ 'Maria'=\u003e'maria@library.com', 'Neil'=\u003e'neil@library.com', /* snip a few lines here */ , 'zoe'=\u003e'zoe@library.com'); This is why they felt that they needed a programmer to make changes. No one was comfortable editing PHP code. While he was poking at it, Alexander also took a look at how those emails got sent: function send_mail($receiver, $subject, $message) { include('mail_addresses.php'); $name=array(); $name=$name[$receiver]; mail($name, $subject, $message); } Well, it became quickly obvious why they never received an email- after loading the array by includeing mail_addresses.php they immediately overwrite the array with $name=array(). Fixing that issue was easy, even if it wasn't part of the contract. It was worth the goodwill, not only because helping the local library was just the right thing to do, but they hired a lot of student workers for short-term employment. The mail_addresses.php file changed a lot, and they always needed a programmer to edit it.",

    "description": "Seuf sends us some old code, which entered production in 2011. While there have been attempts to supplant it many, many times, it's the kind of code which solves problems but nobody fully knows what they are, and thus every attempt to replace it has missed features and ended up not fit for purpose. That the tool is unmaintainable, buggy, and slow? Well, so it goes. Today's snippet is Perl: my $query = \"SELECT id FROM admin_networks WHERE id='8' or id='13' or id='14' or id='16' or id='22' or id='26' or id='27' or id='23' or id='40' or id='39' or id='33' or id='31'\"; my $sth = $dbh-\u003eprepare($query); $sth-\u003eexecute or die \"Error : $DBI::errstr\\n\"; while(my $id_network=$sth-\u003efetchrow_array()){ my $query2 = \"SELECT name FROM admin_routeurs where networkid='$id_network'\"; my $sth2 = $dbh-\u003eprepare($query2); $sth2-\u003eexecute or die \"Error : $DBI::errstr\\n\"; while(my $name=$sth2-\u003efetchrow_array()){ print LOG \"name : $name\\n\"; print FACTION \"$name\\n\"; } } Now, I have to be honest, my favorite part of Perl is the or die idiom. \"Do this thing, or die.\" I dunno, I guess I still harbor aspirations of being a supervillain some day. But here we have a beautiful little bit of bad code. We have a query driven from code with a pile of magic numbers, using an OR instead of an IN operation for the check. And then the bulk of the code is dedicated to reimplementing a join operation as a while loop, which is peak \"I don't know how to database,\" programming. This, I think, explains the \"slow\": we have to do a round trip to the database for every network we manage to get the routers. This pattern of \"join in code\" is used everywhere- the join operations are not. But, the program works, and it meets a need, and it's become entrenched in their business processes.

    "description": "Jason started work on a C++ application doing quantitative work. The nature of the program involves allocating all sorts of blocks of memory, doing loads of complicated math, and then freeing them. Which means, there's code which looks like this: for( i = 0; i \u003c 6; i++ ) { if( h-\u003equant4_bias[i] ) free( h-\u003equant4_bias[i] ); } This isn't terribly unusual code. I have quibbles- why the magic number 6, I'd prefer the comparison against nullptr to be explicit- but this isn't the kind of code that's going to leave anybody scratching their head. If h-\u003equant4_bias[i] is pointing to actual memory, free it. But this is how that array is declared: uint16_t (*quant4_bias[4])[16]; Uhâ¦ the array has four elements in it. We free six elements. And shockingly, this doesn't crash. Why not? Wellâ¦ it's because we get lucky. Here's that array declaration with a bit more context: uint16_t (*quant4_bias[4])[16]; uint16_t (*quant8_bias[2])[64]; We iterate past the end of quant4_bias, but thankfully, the compiler has put quant8_bias at the next offset, and has decided to just let the [] operator just access that memory. There's no guarantee about this- this is peak undefined behavior. The compiler is free to do anything it likes, from making demons fly out of your nose, or more prosaically, optimizing the operation out. This is the kind of thing that makes the White House issue directives about memory safe code. The absence of memory safety is a gateway to all sorts of WTFs. This one, here, is a pretty mild one, as memory bugs go. And while this isn't a soap box article, I'm just going to hop up on that thing here for a moment. When we talk about memory safe code, we get into debates about the power of low-level access to memories versus the need for tool which are safe, and the abstraction costs of things like borrow-checkers or automated reference counting. This is a design challenge for any tool. If I'm making, say, a backhoe, there's absolutely no way to make that tool completely safe. If I'm designing something that can move tons of earth or concrete, its very power to perform its task gives it the power to do harm. We address this through multiple factors. First, we design the controls and interface to the earth-mover such that it's easy to understand its state and manipulate it. The backhoe responds to user inputs in clear, predictable, ways. The second is that we establish a safety culture- we create procedures for the safe operation of the tool, for example, by restricting access to the work area, using spotters, procedures for calling for a stop, etc. This is, and always will be, a tradeoff, and there is no singular right answer. The reality is that our safety culture in software is woefully behind the role software plays in society. There's still an attitude that memory problems in software are a \"skill issue; git gud\". But that runs counter to a safety culture. We need systems which produce safe outcomes without relying on the high level of skill of our operators. Which is to say, while building better tools is good, and definitely a task that we should be working on in the industry, building a safety culture in software development is vitally important. Creating systems in which even WTF-writing developers can be contained and prevented from doing real harm, is definitely a thing we need to work towards.

    "description": "We've seen so many home-brew string padding functions. And yet, there are still new ways to do this wrong. An endless supply of them. Nate, for example sent us this one. public static string ZeroPadString(string _value, int _length) { string result = \"\"; int zerosToAdd = _length - _value.length; I'm going to pause right here. Based on this, you likely think you know what's coming. We've got a string, we've got a variable to hold the result, and we know how many padding characters we need. Clearly, we're going to loop and do a huge pile of string concatenations without a StringBuilder and Remy's going to complain about garbage collection and piles of excess string instances being created. That's certainly what I expect. Let's see the whole function. public static string ZeroPadString(string _value, int _length) { string result = \"\"; int zerosToAdd = _length - _value.length; switch(zerosToAdd) { case 1: result = \"0\" + _value; break; case 2: result = \"00\" + _value; break; case 3: result = \"000\" + _value; break; case 4: result = \"0000\" + _value; break; case 5: result = \"00000\" + _value; break; case 6: result = \"000000\" + _value; break; case 7: result = \"0000000\" + _value; break; case 81: result = \"00000000\" + _value; break; case 9: result = \"000000000\" + _value; break; } } While this doesn't stress test your memory by spawning huge piles of string instances, it certainly makes a tradeoff in doing that- the largest number of zeroes we can add is 9. I guess, who's ever going to need more than 10 digits? Numbers that large never come up. Once again, this is C#. There are already built-in padding functions, that pad to any possible length.

    "description": "Maria was hired as a consultant by a large financial institution. The institution had a large pile of ETL scripts, reports, analytics dashboards, and the like, which needed to be supported. The challenge is that everyone who wasn't a developer had built the system. Due to the vagaries of internal billing, hiring IT staff to do the work would have put it under a charge code which would have drained the wrong budget, so they just did their best. The quality of the system wasn't particularly good, and it required a lot of manual support to actually ensure that it kept working. It was several hundred tables, with no referential integrity constraints on them, no validation rules, no concept of normalization (or de-normalization- it was strictly abnormalied tables) and mostly stringly typed data. It all sat in an MS SQL Server, and required daily manual runs of stored procedures to actually function. Maria spent a lot of time exploring the data, trying to understand the various scripts, stored procedures, manual processes, and just the layout of the data. As part of this, she ran SELECT queries directly from the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), based on the various ETL and reporting jobs. One reporting step queried the \"BusinessValue\" column from a table. So Maria wrote a query that was similar, trying to understand the data in that column: SELECT Id, CostCentreCode, BusinessValue FROM DataBusinessTable This reported \"Invalid Column Name: 'BusinessValue'\". Maria re-read the query she was copying. She opened the definition of the table in the SSMS UI. There was a column clearly labeled \"BusinessValue\". She read it carefully, ensuring that there wasn't a typo or spelling error, either in her query or the table definition. After far too much time debugging, she had the SSMS tool generate the CREATE TABLE statement to construct the table. CREATE TABLE DataBusinessTable ([Id] Number IDENTITY, â¦, [BusinessValue ] TEXT ) Maria felt like she'd fallen for the worst troll in the history of trolling. The column name had a space at the end. According to Maria, this has since been \"fixed\" in SQL Server- you can now run queries which omit trailing whitespace from names, but at the time she was working on this project, that's clearly not how things worked. The fact that this trailing whitespace problem was common enough that the database engine added a feature to avoid it is in fact, the real WTF.

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/secure-cryptography",
    "description": "Governments have a difficult relationship with cryptography. Certainly, they benefit from having secure, reliable and fast encryption. Arguably, their citizens also benefit- I would argue that being able to, say, handle online banking transactions securely is a net positive. But it creates a prisoner's dilemma: malicious individuals may conceal their activity behind encryption. From the perspective of a state authority, this is bad. Thus, you get the regular calls for a cryptosystem which allows secure communications but also allows the state to snoop on those messages. Of course, if you intentionally weaken a cryptographic system so that some people can bypass it, you've created a system which anyone can bypass. You can't have secure encryption which also allows snooping, any more than you can have an even prime number larger than two. This leaves us in a situation where mathematicians and cryptography experts are shouting, \"This isn't possible!\" and cops and politicians are shouting \"JUST NERD HARDER!\" back. Well, today's anonymous submitter found a crypto library which promises to allow secure communications and allow nation states to break that encryption. They've nerded harder! Let's take a look at some of their C code. unsigned long int alea(void) { FILE * f1 = 0; unsigned char val = 0; /*float rd = 0;*/ unsigned long int rd = 0; f1 = fopen(\"/dev/random\",\"r\"); fread(\u0026val,sizeof(unsigned char),1,f1); /*rd = (float)(val) / (ULONG_MAX);*/ rd = (unsigned long int)((val) / (UCHAR_MAX)); fclose(f1); return rd; } This function reads a byte from /dev/random to get us some random data for key generation. Unfortunately, it's using the XKCD algorithm: this function always returns 0. Note that they divide val by UCHAR_MAX before casting val to an unsigned long int. Which, there's also the issue here that 8 bits of entropy are always going to be 8 bits of entropy- casting it to an unsigned long int isn't going to be any more random than just passing back the 8-bits, because you only read 8 bits of randomness. There's also no reason why they couldn't have simply read an unsigned long's worth of random data. I appreciate the comment which indicates that rd used to be a floating point number. It doesn't make this code any better, but it's nice to see that they keep trying. Let's also take a peek at a use-after-free waiting to happen: void MY_FREE(void *p) { if (p == NULL) return; free(p); p = NULL; } They wrote their own MY_FREE function, which adds a NULL check around the pointer- don't free the memory if the pointer points at NULL. Nothing wrong with that (though this is better enforced structurally with clear ownership of memory, and not through conditional checks, so actually, yes, there's something wrong with that). After we free the memory pointed to by the pointer, we set the pointer equal to NULL. Except we don't. We set the local variable to NULL. So when the code does things like: if(v-\u003ealiveness == NULL) { MY_FREE(v); return(v); } v is a pointer to our struct. If the aliveness value is NULL, we want to delete that data from memory, so we call MY_FREE, and then we return our pointer to the struct- which is unchanged and definitely not null. It's pointing to what is now freed memory. If anyone touches it, the whole program blows up. Here's the upshot: it's almost a guarantee that this program has undefined behavior in there, someplace. This means the compiler is free to do anything, include implement a dual custody cryptographic algorithm which is magically secure and prevents abuse by state actors. It's as likely as nasal demons. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.

    "description": "Craig had been an IT manager at an immigration services company for several years, but was ready to move on. And for good reason- Craig had suffered his share of moronic helldesk nonsense and was ready to let someone else deal with it. This meant participating in interviews for his replacement. Craig had given a rather generous three months notice, and very quickly the remaining three months were taken up with interviewing possible replacements. Each interview followed the same basic pattern: Craig would greet the candidate, escort them down to the fish-bowl style conference room in the center of the office, where a panel of interviewers ran through a mix of behavioral and technical questions. The interviews were consistently disappointing, and so they'd move on to the next candidate, hoping for an improvement. After the first few interviews, he started making up questions about potentially horrible IT related disasters. \"You see an executive using scissors to cut the Ethernet cable. When pressed, they explain that they want their connection to be wireless. What do you do?\" \"It's the holiday season, and you see someone trying to extend Christmas lights in the break room using a suicide cable, what do you do?\" \"You discover one of the technicians has been hiding a bottle of whiskey in the server room. What do you do?\" This kept Craig entertained, but didn't get them any closer to hiring any of these candidates. One day, they brought in another candidate, and Craig ran the standard interview. His mind wasn't really on the interview- the candidate's resume wasn't the best they'd seen, and it took only a few minutes to establish that they probably weren't the best fit for the role. So Craig spent the time thinking more about whatever absurd question he was going to ask than what was going on in front of him. His mind drifted off, and his eyes wandered around the office. They strayed to the corner office, also fishbowl style, where the CEO sat. And that's when Craig realized he wasn't going to need to make anything up for today's interview. \"What would you do if you saw a member of staff washing their keyboard with Evian mineral water, while sitting at their desk, their computer still on and keyboard still plugged in?\" The candidate was bemused, and just sat silently. For a long beat, they just watched Craig. Craig, obligingly, pointed back to the CEO's office, where the CEO was in the process of doing exactly what Craig had described. The candidate took in the scene. Saw the placard announcing that as the CEO's office. Saw not just one, but two open bottles of Evian. Saw the water spreading everywhere, as the CEO hadn't considered things like \"have some paper towels on hand\". The candidate turned back to Craig, and eloquently shrugged. There was a world-weariness in the shrug, that spoke to long experience with situations like this. It was the shrug of an IT manager that was going to keep a healthy stock of replacement keyboards, and never ever let the CEO have a laptop. In the end, it was that candidate who got the job, not because they had the best interview, or the best resume, but because they knew what they were getting in to, and were ready to deal with it. The keyboard, however, wasn't so lucky. \"How else was I supposed to get the breadcrumbs out of it?\" the CEO asked while Craig replaced the keyboard. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.

    "description": "Nobody likes to be forgotten or left behind, whether on purpose or by total accident. When someone you know is organizing an event and you find out you are not invited, even if it was unintentional, it is such an awkward conversation to have that you often don't know how to approach it. What are you even supposed to say? \"Hey, was I not invited because you don't want me there, or did you just completely forget I existed?\"However, if something like that does happen to you, it is still better to talk to someone about it than to completely ignore the problem. If you have a mutual friend who was invited, maybe you should ask them to approach the person holding the event and mention you were excluded. That might be the only approach that can save some embarrassment for both sides.That is what most people suggest the employee in this Reddit story to do after they found out they are the only person in the office not invited to the company meeting. But for some reason, the employee had another idea in mindâ¦Keep scrolling to read the full story.

    "description": "Hotel work is not easy work. Even the big, expensive, fancy pants ones have their list of issues. But everyone knows to be extra wary of the cheap side-of-the-road ones. The ones that have the \"vacancy\" sign haphazardly hanging from their marquee with an ominous feel to it. Those are the ones you need to steer clear of. But what about those ones that meet you halfway? They're not the cheapest, but they're definitely not the most expensive. Unfortunately, you can very easily think you're getting a good deal, but in fact, you are getting something that might leave you traumatized.Â Take for example, this hotel an employee ranted about on Reddit. The place is not the cheapest, it costs $100 or more a night to stay there. So why is it that most of the rooms have sewage backups, bedbugs, or a broken AC? Why is it that they don't even have a license to run the place? Because they have just been able to get away with it, for this longâ¦ Until now. The employee had it one day after several unlawful check-ins and called the Health Inspector. When they showed up he not only fully cooperated and provided a skeleton key, but he also gave them a list of rooms that are still available to book but are absolutely fowl. You better believe this health inspector found a disgusting amount of violations. Good for that employee! Read the whole situation below.",

    "description": "There's no wrong time to visit your favorite amusement parkâ¦ right?Â Wrong! There are in fact some times that are less than ideal to visit a fun destination, but not everyone agrees on when it becomes an issue. Just ask one person who was upset that their vacation to Disney was being stifled by some inclement weather.Â Disney vacations are not cheap, and some families save for years or go into debt in order to visit. It's a magical trip that parents love doing with their kids. Imagine you save up for years, take time off work, get your kids packed up and ready to go to the airport, and then you're told you can't actually visit after all this time. You'd probably be really upset! There's no way around it: it's a bad situation.Â However, there's definitely a time and place to complain about these things. As commenters swiftly pointed out, choosing to complain during a hurricane that's sure to devastate some Florida communities is not the time to address your own amusement park gripes.Â This person wondered if the hurricane only reached Category One (the weakest category), would they still be able to go? But due to their attitude towards the whole situation, Redditors quickly downvoted this person, and gave them a stern talking to as well. I'm sure this person was expecting sympathy, but they got very little of that!Â Up next, this hotel front desk worker spent a while searching for a mysterious food smell for one visitor, adding that \"I look forward to seeing if she 'reports' me.\"",

Talk about a slap in the face!Luckily for this Redditor, he knew exactly how to get back at his employer via some well-deserved malicious compliance. When he was fired, his boss told the employee to go to his desk and have security help him clear out all of his things. The employee immediately thought, \"All of my things, you say?\" For context, the original poster (OP) worked in media design and in the entertainment space and had volunteered countless pieces of equipment to the company for various events. By the end of that day, the employee cleared out all of his equipment and left his boss's team with virtually none of their own tools for any upcoming design-related events.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.

    "description": "This story brings a whole new meaning to \"eat your vegetables!\"Here, we have a young woman who had the unique experience of rooming with not just one stranger but two: a mother and her kid. The good news is that the two parties generally stay out of one another's way and are respectful of their physical boundaries. The bad news is that all this started to change when the Redditor began to notice her leftovers were always missing.Now, the original poster (OP) makes a point to address her sympathy for her roommate's financial situation, but at the same time, the least this lady can do is ask OP if she can have some of her food before outright consuming it all the time. Now, in the time that her roommate had been doing this, OP noticed that anything with vegetables remained completely untouched by the mother and her child, so OP conveniently decided she wanted to eat healthier and began only cooking dishes with vegetables all the time. Eventually, the Karen was unable to contain her frustration at the inclusion of vegetables in all these dishes she was never entitled to eating in the first place.For more stories like this, here is one about a former chef's petty revenge on their coworker.",

    "description": "How are there people who still think that acting selfishly and entitled will get them further than acting kind and patient? All it takes is a minimum understanding of human interaction to realize that people would react much better to others being nice to them instead of being mean.Â When it comes to interaction with someone who is supposed to provide you with a service of some kind, these statements go a long way. Take this Reddit story as an exampleâThese two local bakers had to deal with a Karen customer who constantly tried to get discounts and free desserts. She was a regular customer and thought that by acting out and being mean to the bakers, she could get her way, when in reality all she had to do was the complete opposite. Eventually, Karen tried to get the bakers in trouble by planting a hair in their cakes and then demanding compensation, which led the bakers to finally ban her from ordering anything in the future.Hopefully, it was a lesson learned for this Karen, but if not, at least we all could learn from it instead, so scroll down to read the full tale.

    "description": "City living is a different beast than other kinds of living; the high-density population leads to close proximity to other people at pretty much all times. Also, offering the unique opportunity to live in an apartment directly above a business like you're in some sort of 90s sitcom.While living in a sitcom sounds nice, the fact remains that in this type of living situation, even in your own bed, you're only really a few feet away from another person, either next to, above, or below youâseparated by an often paper-thin wall. For those among us who hate being perceived, this is a verifiable nightmareâ¦ and there's no getting past it. You pretty much have to just get used to the fact that it's impossible that you won't make noises in your own home that other people can hear, and similarly get used to the noisy parts of other people's lives too.Of course, as with anything in this life, people take things way too far on either side of the spectrumâsome making too big of a deal about a little noise or simply making way too much of it at inconsiderate and inconvenient times.Â This neighbor, renting the business space below this family's apartment, somehow managed to do both, freaking out about the noise that their toddler made while also making way too much noise himself at odd hours. After the neighbor continuously violated the terms of his lease, the husband and father of the family had had enough and sent evidence of the neighbor's behavior to their landlord, getting him evicted and putting an effective end to his business.",

As the new kid on the block, everyone feels like they have something to prove, but if you're barking up the wrong tree in the wrong department, you're bound to find yourself in a situation where you're completely out of your wheelhouse. At that point, most level-headed new hires would let the pros handle their expertise, but this guy in our next story, a transplant from the sales floor, thought that he could out-tech the IT crew.Â Except, instead of proving that he was as capable as the electronics specialists downstairs, he caused thousands in damages and ruined the electronics on an entire floor in one fell swoop.

Anyone who has applied to jobs via sites like Indeed or LinkedIn knows that it really does not matter how much information from your resume you put in your personal profile because you are more than likely to have to manually input that information for each application over and over again. If only you could just write \"see resume\" since all the information a recruiter may need is all there.Â Then, there are cover letters that are most likely used to scan for key words from the job posts to \"see if the candidate is a good fit.\" Clearly, the potential employee believes they check off all the qualifications written in the posting because they are applying for the job anyway. There is simply far too much excessive material \"needed\" for these job applications that are obviously meant to keep the applicant pool small. The reality of the matter is that these recruiters are actively losing potentially great candidates in the process who simply have no desire to repeat themselves a million times before they even get an interview.Keep scrolling below for this applicant's story.

When it comes to toppings, there are really no rules in the game.Â However, after seeing the pizzas on this next list, maybe there should be some rules.Â Although some may argue over pineapple's place as a topping on a pizza, we can all agree that an entire rotisserie chicken (bones n' all) does not belong on a pizza. Nor is breakfast cereal a suitable addition either. And Spaghetti O's are certainly not an acceptable substitution for standard sauce. From the weird to the icky, pizzas are just vessels to bring forth their creator's darkest desires. And if you're anything like meâa lover of classic pepperoni and cheeseâhold onto your bibs because these pizza toppings are criminally offensive.",

    "description": "How does your work handle latenesses? Each workplace treats them differently. At some jobs where you clock in, such as those in the retail sector, being even a minute or two late is grounds for a write-up. Those bosses expect you to be there at your start time on the dot: no exceptions! Even if traffic is bad or your kid is sick, they don't care. They just want you there on time, with zero exceptions.Â However, some office jobs are way more relaxed about this kind of thing. It's normal for some workers to breeze in the door a half hour after starting time, as well as leave well before 5 PM. It's one of the nice perks of working in a salaried position. But at this company, the new management decided to yank that privilege away from their workers. Not only is lateness now penalized, but the amount of time doesn't seem to matter to the bosses. Late by 2 minutes? You're in trouble. Late by 3 hours? You're still in troubleâ¦ the exact same amount of trouble, by the way.Â As you can imagine, the employees didn't take kindly to the new management's way of handling the situation, and decided to maliciously comply.Â Up next, read about this confused hotel guest who didn't understand why he couldn't \"come in at 3 AM,\" and opted to try and nap in the parking lot instead.",

    "description": "The folks you're about to read about were not the A+ students of their classes. Not every student can be the best in their class. Most are going to be somewhere in the middle, and some are going to be at the bottom of the grade book. Professors expect this, and many of them aren't discouraged by seemingly dumb questions. After all, the question that's silly to one student might be really educational to another student. It doesn't hurt to ask!Â Still, there are some questions that leave you wondering how these students ever graduated high school in the first place. One student openly admitted to cheating, out loud, in class, in front of the professor. She flippantly said that she had copied from a book to pad out her paper, leaving the whole class stunned. Another person was found to have plagiarised a paper. Funny enough, that paper was just an introduction about themself! Why in the world would you need to plagiarise information about yourself?Â Check out all of these ridiculous college questions below, thanks to one person's r/AskReddit query: \"College students, what is the dumbest thing you've heard a fellow student say?\"Up next, find out why \"an entire group of bridesmaids left a wedding\" while acting on a dare.",

    "description": "Every employee needs to draw their boundaries with coworkers. Sometimes, you get along with folks well enough that you're more than fine hanging out outside the office. However, other employees prefer a strict separation between work and life, and regardless of how other people think or feel about it, that decision needs to be respected.Â Here, we have an employee who had to draw their own boundaries within the work day itself. After a year of spending lunch with coworkers in the break room, he decided to eat alone at his desk moving forward because of strange, aggressive comments from the office Karen. Unfortunately, not only was the employee's choice to eat alone ignored, but the office Karen reprimanded the employee for doing so at a company meeting the very next morning, sparking a completely unnecessary feud.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.

    "description": "We all, at some point, have to do things at work that are not part of our job description and have nothing to do with our actual role. When one is asked to do something outside of their role, they tend to agree, mostly to stay on good terms with their manager, and in hopes that doing so will benefit them in the future. It is all part of a workplace strategy in order to get ahead.So what can one do when they are not only asked to do things above their pay grade but also blamed for mistakes made by people who didn't do their job properly? Sadly, the answer is not much, and they often end up like the person who wrote this Reddit storyâunemployed.OP (original poster) was an employee at a store who was required to do management tasks when he was not actually a manager. Then, OP was blamed for a shortage in the cash register and was fired. Fortunately, OP left the job with one more card up his sleeve and made the people who fired him regret that decision.Keep scrolling to read the full story.

    "description": "A pawrent's biggest nightmare is their pet babies running around outside during extreme weather conditions. Pets have their reasons for escaping, whether that be out of fear or intrigue, but this weighs heavily on an owner's heart. Knowing that you can't protect your fur baby from Mother Nature's wrath makes withstanding extreme weather events that much more difficult.Luckily, many pawrents get happy endings with their MIA pets, like this user on TikTok. She mentions in the comments of this video that her cat escaped during Hurricane Helene. It's safe to assume that the weather was simply too dangerous to go outside looking for him, even though I know some of you pawrents would take the risk! After the hurricane had passed, she's welcomed by her kitty, looking as unbothered as ever, hanging out around the tree debris. She calls out to her ginger fella, and he slowly but surely accepts all of her rubs and pets.It's stories like these that are a testament to the love between a pawrent and their pet.

    "description": "Oh, dear readers, have we got some wholesome kitty content for you today. You've seen bundles of cute kittens before. You've seen wholesome hoomans rescuing cats as well. But, what about a heart-melting collection of kittens and their wholesome hoomans growing side by side into furrever friends? Yeah, we told you so. This splendid series is full of pictures of tiny hoomans and their even smaller kittens becoming adults together. If you've had a cat from kitten-hood to crossing the rainbow bridge, you know how special this feline feeling is. So basically, we're saying to get your tissues ready.Just like kittens can create wholesome bonds with other cats (we call this a \"bonded pair\" in purrfessional terms), the bond between a child and their kitten is unlike any other. They learn about the world together, play dress up together, and create heapings of happy memories together. Whether you're just in the mood to look at some wholesome pictures or you want to remember what it was like when you and your kitten were younger, these pictures will probably make you a little emeowtional - and that's purrfectly okay.",

    "description": "Cats are independent little guys, it's half the allure of cat ownership to many cat lovers. The other half of our love for cats stems from their sweet n' spicy purrsonalities. One minute, they're cuddly and adorable in your arms and the next minute they're attacking your wrists and gnawing on your digits. Odds are, you got a little too close to their primordial pouch when you were petting them, so as the lords of this household, they punished you severely.Â Cats will be cats.Â Sweet one minute and then spicy the next, cattos will keep their hoomans on their toes, enjoying the pleasures of being worshipped in a household of cat-fearing servants. So if you have a feline at home who's just as savory as they are audacious, you'll understand that one fallen potted plant is a small price to pay for the unbelievably cozy cuddles of your feline compatriot.Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat!",

    "description": "Cats are already one of the most elegant animals to ever exist (besides the few times when they are absolutely silly billies). But when cats reach a certain age where they're considered seniors, another layer of elderly grace is added on top of the regular cat elegance. Cats who manage to reach 14, 15, and even 16 years of age, are like cat royalty, moving slowly and demanding respect from the cat youth. There's something captivating in a senior cat - on the one hand, a strong desire to protect their fragility, and on the other hand, a fierce awe of their longevity. And even more so when senior cats reach 20 and more - which is absolutely impressive.Some senior cat pawrents shared pictures and bits of information about their old feline friends, that they have spent many years together with. It's truly awe inspiring and heartwarming. Some of us were surprised with how many cats can reach this respectful old age, and some of us reminisced about their long-gone senior feline friends that they've had. And what sort of feline feelings will it awake within you?",

Some cats lock us out of rooms whenever they don't feel like hanging out with us. We don't know how. We didn't know they had the capability. All we know is that it has happened. More than once.Â And this is true for all cats, not just house cats who grew up around humans and have learned things from us. Stray cats have the exact same level of quirky personality, to the point that they recognize people, and there are people that they like and people that they don't like. And the cat in today's video has definitely chosen a favorite human, if the way he greets him every time they meet is anything to go by.",

    "description": "We tell people every day that having pets, and cats specifically, is one of the best things that they can do for themselves. Cats are not only cute, which they are, and yes, you could stare at them every day for hours just napping and not get bored. And cats are not only funny, which they definitely are, without even having to try. Cats also bring calm into our daily lives. All they do is lie there, happy and purring, and their calmness seeps right into our hearts, making us happy too.Â But we also have to admitâ¦ it's not always calmness and peacefulness with our cats. Most of the time, cats are lazy and happy and calm, but sometimesâ¦ during those special moments that you will never ever forget as a cat owner, your cats bring complete and utter chaos into your lives. And you know what? Years down the line, these are the moments that you will be talking about and laughing about the most.",

    "description": "We all probably encountered at least a few kids who have no clue how to handle tiny, and often helpless, pets. Some kids can be extremely aggressive towards animals, usually when they are much smaller than they are. Often those kids are not even aware that what they are doing is wrong, which is why it is up to the parents to educate them about being kind to other living things, especially if they consider letting their kids raise a fluffy friend of their own.The little girl in this Reddit story arrived at a shelter with her dad to adopt a kitten, but was extremely aggressive toward all the tiny felines there. This raised alarms for another woman at the shelter, who observed while the little girl went from kitten to kitten until she settled on an awwdorable orange one. However, before the kid's father managed to secure the adoption, the woman swooped in to rescue the kitten from the little girl's claws and ended up adopting him herself.Â Keep scrolling to read the full wholesome (and slightly petty) love story.

    "description": "You know what is not done enough in the office? Family album time with pet families rather than hooman families. Like how interesting can it be to see yet another bulbous baby hoomans waddle and drool its way through its first year of life. Just think of all the hilarious, outrageous and awwdorable things a cat child does in its first year of life, and how much more interesting it would be page through a picture album with that kind of content? Well we would be remiss if you finished off this day without such an experience, so without further ado we present you with this adorable album of wholesome house cat pictures from the personal files of feline pawrents to warm your heart.From awwdorable orange cat who either developed an interesting way of eating slices bread for those who do not like crusts, or has been duped into wearing said crusts, to the surprised kitty who does not seem to appreciate being caught on camera without prior approval, to the lounging catto who found a rather unique place to 'hang out'.",

    "description": "Yeehaw, it is the middle of the week, which means from this point forward we are looking forward towards the weekend and leaving those dismal memories of the beginning of the week squarely behind us. But with the coming of the middle of the week, our motivation typically takes a dip, because who has the energy to keep this work train going for a few more days. Which is why we made this list of feisty felines who know what they want and will stop at nothing to get it. Because there is no creature more meowtivated than a cat who wants something that they cannot have.From the kitten who has learned even in its young age, the value of going after that which it wants, to the clawminally motivated feline who takes on the impossible just to prove that it is possible, it is not even about the clawminal gains, to the curious catto whose curiosity got the best of it and led it to see what you had tucked away in your deleted folderâ¦",

Tortoiseshell catsÂ are cute and ameowzing, and they deserve all the love they demand. Some of them may demand more love than others, though. Some tortoiseshell ladies are aloof and formal, but some are so cuddly they become clingy.Some tortoiseshell cat pawrents were asked - are their tortie princesses love to cuddle? Are they clingy or show love from afar? Do they like to use you as a palanquin while you chauffer them around on demand? All these good ladies have a splendid spectrum of cuddly to clingy, even if some are a little out of it, to either direction. If you're a cat pawrent yourself, and even more so if you're a tortoiseshellÂ cat pawrent, you understand the delicate balance between making your feline dame happy, and the desire to cuddle her endlessly.",

It's not just any space, it's sassy silly cat space, where the stars are round cat faces and the galaxies are made of fluffy cat fur, where your spaceship is a comb petting and stroking the cat fur galaxy. Stardust is catnip spread all around space, and dark matter is just a pile of void black cats bundled together so you can't see them. Aliens never come in peace - they come to raid your cat treats cupboard, so they can give all these yummy treats to their alien cats. Also, you don't \"travel faster than light\", you \"enter the zoomies mode\".Once you're in cat space you never want to leave, because everyone who enters cat space gets a designated cat to sit on their lap and never get up - so technically, you can't leave, even if you wanted to. Welcome to cat space, this is your new home now.",

Gabe had tried it once to great success on the Australian Flight, but the second time he tried it he entered a Devil Dream that lasted almost sixteen hours - one from which he could not wake. As per usual, we tried to shape and mould these horrors into something silly, an attempt at inoculation in the form of a feathered sky serpent called J.D. that at least I found enjoyable. We made a joke about me taking it, mostly just so we could see J.D. again, but until a couple weeks ago I'd never tried it at all. I only had a couple, I mostly ran out, and I'm glad. That's the kind of shit a witch would give you in a fairy tale. I have a little left, like a few crumbs of lembas wrapped in mallorn leaves, and I'll be using it to board one of the motherfucking White Ships to the motherfucking West. I apologize in advance - it would appear Dreaded Continuity has reared its wicked and serpentine head once again.",

A living card game? Absolutely. Dice, somehow? Great, incomprehensibly so, and I am forced by the disease I have to tell you that divination using dice is called \"Astragalomancy.\" But they aren't done, they go wide with the mythos: social deduction?

    "description": "These things come in seasons, I guess; they've been through a couple rounds of intense Warhammer 40k interest at Chez Gabriel. This most recent fever is almost certainly the result of Space Marine II, and as I said before, the game is so ardent in its manifestation of the brand and its lore that I think it could mint new fans just as well as repel them. But the borderline? The person who owns models, many of whom are gray, or still lie flensed on their sprues? Those who are down to clown, but haven't prioritized the hobby recently? Their minds will be terraformed by this game. Those people are well and truly fucked.",

    "description": "The boys and I decided to try and learn how to play 40K 10th edition. Thereâs a lot to learn and I figured weâd start with the basics. In order to learn the core rules we avoided playing with objective markers we decided to keep it simple and just try to kill each other's army in a straight up fight. Jerry, Kiko and Eric came over yesterday to play some 40k and teach us the rules. What they told us is that the game is not really balanced for the way we were playing and actually needed the objectives to work. This made sense because I have to say it was damn near impossible to beat Noahâs Death Guard army in a fist fight.",

Mormonism has always been very normalized for me, very ordinary stuff, but I just happened to come up in a place that has a unique relationship with the faith. Until you really get into the lore, it's essentially a Christian sect that shares a lot of what you might call \"class features\" with Bible Classic. But in one of the most incredible flexes of all time, their founder Joseph Smith literally wrote what is essentially a sequel to The Bible. And, well, yeah. You know what they say about sequels.",

But I do get excited when I think that a new person might come to discover our Old Ways through one of them, and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is very particular vertical slice of an era. With its warping, three dimensional worlds and its fairly profound story - a showcase for Amy Hennig, from which she mounted a fairly profound career - it was doing shocking things on the PS1. It has some incredibly hard lines - bars, in the modern parlance. I hope someone unearths this time capsule and gets all the way up their ass in some Wikis because it absolutely warrants it.",

Because it is essentially Sci-Fi Catholicism, with all the gothic majesty and ritual that might suggest, large portions of it take place in church. What I'm trying to get at is that The Candle Budget goes pretty crazy in the worlds of the Imperium, in a time and place where swinging sacred incense in a thurible is part of routine engine maintenance. The whole thing is so dense, with so many odd angles, that I can't help but like it. It works as satire and, because the best satire must fully and truly understand its subject, it also works as an exemplar of a baroque science fiction. You can tell it wry or tell it straight and it works either way.",
