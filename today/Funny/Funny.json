    "description": "Getting rejected or passed over for a promotion that you've been promised for years is always going to leave a bad taste in your mouth. You might believe the words of your employer when they tell you that your efforts will one day lead you to a higher role. And, yet, every time the opportunity presents itself to promote you, they go with someone else, and you're faced with that, no matter what their intentions might have initially been, they're dangling a carrot on a stick out in front of you that they're never going to let you catch.The reality is that for what you're paid, you're too valuable right where you're at, and not only would they have to pay you more to promote you, but they'd be losing their most reliable workhorse, too.That's what this legal assistant shared experiencing when, for four years, they had been promised that they'd be moved into the role of a paralegal, despite continuously glowing reviews, they were repeatedly passed over and left waiting for the promotion they had been promised. When the latest paralegal was hired, it was done without even posting the role; they only discovered that the firm had hired someone when another attorney needed to move desks to make room for the new hire. Frustrated, the legal assistant shared their experience with this online community, voicing their frustration and sharing how they immediately lined up two interviews for which they would be calling out of work to attend.",

    "description": "It's that time of year once again! It's time to dress up for Halloween, carve some pumpkins, eat some pumpkin pie, pick some apples, and rake the leaves off your lawn. The weather is cooling down while we're heating up a mug of apple cider. For many people, autumn is a perfect time of year: not too hot nor too cold, and full of fun activities for the whole family. However, these people have had a few mildly infuriating things happen to them. One all-too-common gripe was people carving pumpkins, placing them on their front porch, and later discovering they'd been destroyed. Squirrels, deer, and other wildlife just cannot resist munching on jack-o-lanterns. It's a tasty treat for them, and they don't understand that they're ruining your Halloween decorations. Other people realized they're living with a bunch of hooligans upon finding some pumpkin pies that were eaten really bizarrely. You'll have to keep scrolling down to see what I mean (and find out a bunch of ways to never eat a pumpkin pie). Up next, this college student simply cannot understand why his professor won't answer the door during his office hours… except the student keeps showing up at 5 in the morning, or on weekends!",

Our patience goes down rapidly as we progress through the week, and by the time we get to Furiday, we could even give Grumpy Cat a run for her money. Since we need our job and we have bills to pay, we must find a way to let out our feisty feline energy without actually doing anything about it. This is where we come in! We've got some memes of feisty felines being the ultimate jerks to help you avoid doing anything rash while at work. Deep, calming breaths.Live vicariously through these silly cattos doing what cats do best: being jerks whenever they feel like it. This, among many things, is one of the reasons why we wish we were a cat. Oh well. Life isn't fair, is it? At least we have feline funnies to help us release our inner cat. Without them, we would be without a job…literally!",

    "description": "Cats… are regal creatures. Cats and their beauty cannot be impeded. They are independent, they don't need no human, they can take care of themselves, and they never - and mean never - get caught in any moment in which they are any less than purrfect. Or at least that's what they think. And we are sure that they think that. You can see it on their faces. The superiority, thinking that they are better than us, that they are without any impurrfection. But we see through them. We, as cat owners who watch our cats almost every minute of every day, who have our cameras pointed at them as often as we open our phones, we see our cats' derpy moments. They can't hide themselves from our watchful eyes. And every time we see it, every time we catch our cats being their silly selves, we take a photo as fast as we can. Because, as you are going to see today, these photos are awesome.",

Gabe had tried it once to great success on the Australian Flight, but the second time he tried it he entered a Devil Dream that lasted almost sixteen hours - one from which he could not wake. As per usual, we tried to shape and mould these horrors into something silly, an attempt at inoculation in the form of a feathered sky serpent called J.D. that at least I found enjoyable. We made a joke about me taking it, mostly just so we could see J.D. again, but until a couple weeks ago I'd never tried it at all. I only had a couple, I mostly ran out, and I'm glad. That's the kind of shit a witch would give you in a fairy tale. I have a little left, like a few crumbs of lembas wrapped in mallorn leaves, and I'll be using it to board one of the motherfucking White Ships to the motherfucking West. I apologize in advance - it would appear Dreaded Continuity has reared its wicked and serpentine head once again.",

    "description": "...to know which way the wind blows. This week, it's been an ill one. Two of our readers sent us references to the BBC's reports on unusual weather in Bristol - one from the web, and one mobile. Maybe that will help you deduce the source of this error. Frist, Graham F. shared a screenshot of the beeb's mobile app, bellowing \"I know Milton is hitting the US hard right now but that's nothing compared to the 14,000 mph winds here!\"   Snecod, Jeremy P. confirms the story and provides some details from the web page. \"BBC weather is clipping windspeed making it look like it's only 5909mph and not 15909mph... At least they realise something is wrong.\"   Some anonymous American shared a snap of their weather station, which was worth a little chuckle. \"Whether you like it or not, it's the weather, sort of. And, no, this wasn't during the recent eclipse.\" It would have been worse if the crescent had been a \"sunny and clear\" icon, though, given the time of day that the snap was taken. All in all, I have to call this \"not an error'd\".   We had to dig into the surplus bin to pad out the theme with this pair from Stuart H. He opens with \"I can only assume that the forecast is for Hell or a point between the surface and the center of the Sun! I think I need to turn the aircon up a few notches.\"   \"And following on from the forecast on the front-page - it's even worse for the rest of the world!\"   Finally Eric K. reported a temperature extreme \"Hellfire or extinguished sun? My weather app seems unsure of which type of apocalyptic weather conditions we're currently experiencing.\" But I also note this represents an unusually high level of humidity. I haven't checked but maybe one of our readers will look up these coordinates and let us know which burg has been obliterated.   [Advertisement] Continuously monitor your servers for configuration changes, and report when there's configuration drift.

    "description": "Working at a company where the leadership started as technical people has its advantages, but it can also carry costs. Arthur is in one such environment, and while it means that management and labor have a common vocabulary, the company leadership forgets that they're not in a technical role anymore. So they still like to commit code to the project. And that's how things like this happen: if( this.idtoservice != null ) { sOwner = this.idtoservice.Common.Security.Owner; } else if( this.idtoservice != null ) { sOwner = this.idtoservice.Common.Security.Owner; } else if( this.idtoservice != null ) { sOwner = this.idtoservice.Common.Security.Owner; } This isn't one commit from the CEO, it's 4 different commits. It seems like the CEO, perhaps, doesn't understand merge conflicts? This particular bit of bad code is at least absolutely harmless and likely gets compiled out, but it doesn't mean that Arthur doesn't feel the urge to drink every time his CEO makes a new commit.
