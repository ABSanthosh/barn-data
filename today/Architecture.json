During the Japanese occupation, indiscriminate logging occurred, and Japanese cedars were planted as compensation, continuing to thrive until today. However, thanks to the cedar trees, Jeju's barren mountains and fields were filled, and the trees provided protection for the golden, ripening tangerines from the wind.",

    "description": "Owners of large Slovenian post-war suburban houses often took inspiration from older and more prestigious city villas when designing their premises. However, unlike their inspirations, these structures were far simpler in terms of materials and architecture, lacking in excessive luxury and the spacious interiors of the past. Floor plans are typically fragmented into a multitude of small, disconnected rooms arranged around a central staircase. This layout makes it difficult to accommodate the modern spatial expectations of today's clients, who mainly seek an open, airy living space in the style of a \"loft.\"",

The imminent return  of employees after the corona pandemic required rethinking the work environment. T3's vision  was to design human-centric, agile spaces of a new standard. At the outset, a design committee was established with representatives from each Contentful  department, enabling employees to participate fully in the transformation. The result is a space  with human interaction at its core.  'Contentfulers' start their day with end-of trip-facilities such as underground-bike parking,  showers, a fitness room, and custom-designed smart lockers situated throughout the interior. For  a bit of fun, individually programmed speakers in the custom-designed gender-neutral  washrooms make every trip to the loo a different musical experience.",

The building is composed of three volumes: the two chalets and a central service volume that connects them. A long canopy provides a weatherproof pathway to the entrances. Cedar shingles on the exterior and pine board siding on the interior harmonize with the wooded context of the site. Since they are completely independent, the two cottages are designed to be rented separately by different families, or together by a large group of friends - up to 16 visitors. Although they face different directions, the two units offer the same unforgettable experience thanks to their similar interior layout.",

While most constructions today still opt for traditional pitched or flat roofs, advancements in construction materials and techniques are leading to greater design exploration and layout variations. This has resulted in a rise in green roofs, passive insulation solutions, and more innovative uses of rooftops. One particular case has been the recurrence of the staircase or terraced roofs that often bring about a smooth continuity with the site and provide additional functional spaces to the project.",

This influence has become increasingly relevant in the context of climate change, which has led to rising temperatures and the creation of challenging environments. In response, designers are constantly working to adapt cities to heatwaves through large-scale urban strategies. On a smaller scale, such as in residential settings, the issue can be addressed more specifically through various shading solutions.",

The design prioritizes the preservation of the site's natural elements, most notably an ancient Annab tree (jujube). One of the key concepts was to create a pathway leading from the site entrance to a small courtyard, with a unique staircase. This staircase would serve as a prominent and inviting feature. Additionally, numerous small voids were designed to direct natural light into interior spaces, creating a unique spatial atmosphere.",

Korngold settled in the building's penthouse, where he resided until his death. As an influential figure in São Paulo's architectural landscape during the 1940s and 1950s, he also designed the CBI Esplanada Building in São Paulo's city center, the Bom Retiro Commercial Center, and various residential buildings in Higienópolis. The apartments within this building feature an intriguing layout distinguished by a large balcony that extends through the bedrooms, along with a small central patio that admits natural light into the living area.",

This problem is exacerbated in cities where tourism and vacation or temporary housing dominate the market, distancing residents from the possibility of accessing affordable urban housing. Furthermore, gentrification, driven by rising rents and real estate speculation, contributes to the displacement of local communities, transforming traditional neighborhoods into areas exclusively oriented toward tourist consumption.",

However, because of the taste and texture, there are not many who choose to eat it every day. There is an enzymatic brown rice recipe which is a tasty and nutritious way to eat brown rice as part of one's daily diet. The only ingredients are brown rice, azuki beans, and sun-dried salt, but the cooking process is quite time-consuming to make it every day. The owner of this company is the first person in Japan to make it possible to cook brown rice in a rice cooker, just as you would cook white rice. She and her partner, who is an engineer, succeeded in commercializing the product several years ago, and the company has been making steady progress ever since.",
