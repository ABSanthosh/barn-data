Over the years, the original house has gradually undergone several renovations, including some non-conceptual extensions.

The exterior of the house was practically unchanged at the request of the investor, the proposal focuses mainly on the solution of the interior spaces.",

With varying block edge length ratios, such as 2:1 or sometimes 3:1, the versatile design adapts to a wide range of uses, dimensions and materials.",

    "description": "Rural environments are often difficult to define in administrative and professional contexts and carry notable biases and complexities. Population and density thresholds are the most common determinants for drawing administrative boundaries, yet other factors, such as infrastructure, employment, and services, contribute to the characterization of rural environments. In the United States, the Census Bureau defines rurality, not by its characteristics or resources, but by absences, as \"any population, housing, or territory not in an urban area.\" For the design and planning community, it is important to define the future of rural environments, not through the metrics of urban resources or infrastructure, but to design a new framework for flexibility, adaptation, and health.",

    "description": "The 2024 Obel Award has been granted to Colectivo C733 for their unique achievement in completing 36 public projects across Mexico over a span of just 36 months. These projects have begun as part of a nationwide initiative led by Mexico's Secretariat for Agrarian, Land, and Urban Development (SEDATU). Collectively named the 36x36 projects, the varied interventions have successfully revitalized a wide range of vulnerable urban and rural areas through a collaborative and community-focused approach. This aligns with the Obel Award's 6th cycle overarching theme, \"Architectures with,\" highlighting initiatives that positively impact both people and the planet.",

With a long tradition of craftsmanship, terrazzo has maintained its relevance over the centuries, continuously adapting to evolving creative expressions. Whether in homes, restaurants, or libraries, it demonstrates remarkable versatility, offering a unique combination of technical qualities, mottled aesthetic, and timeless appeal. As it evolves, terrazzo adapts to modern building standards and growing environmental awareness, ensuring its relevance in contemporary architecture and design while expanding sustainable solutions.",

    "description": "Situated in a small alley in the heart of Hue city, Ton Corner - a coffee shop that embodies an open and dynamic spirit, is inspired by the simple life of small street corners. The original small, deteriorating house was demolished to raise the foundation to prevent flooding. Since the land is leased on a short-term basis, the project is built with a steel structure with the main covering materials being corrugated iron, old wood, and tempered glass. Corrugated iron is considered a roofing material and is only used for covering industrial works. In humid, rainy climates like Hue, people use corrugated iron to cover the outside walls of their houses to prevent water seepage, However, using corrugated iron without proper aesthetic and technical treatment will cause the house to lose its original aesthetic value, even creating a shabby appearance in the urban landscape.",

    "description": "A solid white form that contrasts with its immediate surroundings. This is the principle behind the design of Casa Bosque, located on a narrow lot within a horizontal condominium of attached houses. This white canvas, being homogeneous, does not evoke the subjective mental image of a house and allows for an open perception of what is seen, offering a complete reading of the volume, without areas of concentration or elements that “pull” the eye. As artist Robert Ryman states, “white is merely a way to expose other elements, allowing other things to become visible.” By choosing this volume, the design begins with a unified concept where the design itself defines the flows and layouts contained within this rigid geometry.",
