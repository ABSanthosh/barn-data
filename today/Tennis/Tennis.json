Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/djokovic-arnaldi-geneva-2025-thursday",
    "description": "Novak Djokovic celebrated his 38th birthday with some hard-fought revenge on Thursday at the Gonet Geneva Open. The second seed held firm for a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Matteo Arnaldi to reach the semi-finals at the clay ATP 250 event for the second consecutive year. Djokovic, who fell to Arnaldi at the ATP Masters 1000 in Madrid last month, reeled off five straight games from 1-4 in the second set to seal a one-hour, 40-minute victory. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to be in the semi-finals again,‚Äù said Djokovic, who was defeated by Tomas Machac at that stage last year. ‚ÄúHopefully this year I can go at least a step further, that‚Äôs the goal. I think I‚Äôm playing really good tennis. A straight-sets win, but it was much closer than the score indicates. I was 4-1 down in the second, but somehow I didn‚Äôt lose a game. ‚ÄúI found the optimal state and balance, mentally and emotionally, to be able to play my best tennis when it was most needed. Hopefully I can carry that into tomorrow.‚Äù The birthday boy gets his revenge üí™@DjokerNole is semi-final bound after getting past Arnaldi 6-4 6-4.@genevaopen | #GonetGenevaOpen pic.twitter.com/HJ8RkDWJuq‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) May 22, 2025 Djokovic is now within two victories of claiming his 100th tour-level trophy, with which he would join Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) as the only men to hit the triple-digit mark in the Open Era. There were audible gasps when Djokovic held his right knee in pain after stretching for a forehand in the fifth game of the second set. Yet the former World No. 1, who underwent surgery on that knee last year, moved well to disrupt the Italian‚Äôs rhythm, letting out a mighty roar when he broke for 5-4 before serving out the clash with ease. After levelling his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Arnaldi at 1-1, Djokovic next plays qualifier Cameron Norrie. The Briton defeated fifth seed Alexei Popyrin 7-6(6), 6-4 to reach his ninth tour-level semi-final on clay and first since Rio de Janeiro last year. In the other half of the draw, Hubert Hurkacz continued his strong run of form by dismissing top seed Taylor Fritz 6-3, 7-6(5) in a high-quality serving battle. The Pole dropped just six of 45 first-serve points and saved all three break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to his 22nd tour-level semi-final. Hurkacz, who reached the quarter-finals at the ATP Masters 1000 in Rome last week, triumphed at the last clay-court ATP 250 he played in Estoril last year. He trailed 1/3 in the second-set tie-break against Fritz, but responded with an ace down the middle at 5/5 before converting his only match point. ‚ÄúThank you all for being out here, it‚Äôs maybe not the best weather in Geneva but we appreciate the support,‚Äù Hurkacz said to the crowd. ‚Äú[I hope] that you are enjoying tennis here as [much as] I am.‚Äù Hurkacz will next face qualifier Sebastian Ofner, who rallied past fourth seed Karen Khachanov 4-6, 6-4, 6-4. Ofner, the No. 128 in the PIF ATP Rankings, will aim to advance to his second final after reaching the championship match at the grass-court ATP 250 in Mallorca last year. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Andrey Rublev this week returned to the site of fond personal memories in the Bitpanda Hamburg Open, where the 17-time ATP Tour champion continues to show signs of his best level. The third seed held firm to defeat Luciano Darderi 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 on Thursday and seal a semi-final spot at the clay ATP 500. Rublev, who reached the Hamburg final in 2019 before lifting the trophy a year later, dug deep for his third victory of the week after a difficult couple of months on Tour. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to be in the semi-final,‚Äù said Rublev. ‚ÄúThese were a couple of matches that I needed. I need wins. I needed to struggle, like when you face a tough fight and you don‚Äôt really feel the game, but somehow you are winning. ‚ÄúToday I was able to play much better. It is one extra match that counts for me. I was missing these kinds of matches, because I really need them, and I‚Äôm happy to be back in the semi-final.‚Äù Rublev digs deep üò§@AndreyRublev97 overcomes Darderi 6-1 3-6 6-3 to punch his ticket to a third Hamburg semi-final! @hamburgopenatp | #bitpandahamburgopen | üì∏ Witters pic.twitter.com/Sjn4QN5flU‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) May 22, 2025 Rublev arrived in Germany having gone 2-7 since lifting an ATP 500 crown in Doha in February. Yet he built on his opening wins against Damir Dzumhur and Justin Engel in Hamburg by keeping his cool to overcome Darderi, who was chasing his maiden win against a Top 20 opponent. Rublev converted three of seven break points he earned, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to complete a one-hour, 54-minute win. Awaiting the No. 17 in the PIF ATP Rankings in the semi-finals is Felix Auger-Aliassime, who edged Alexandre Muller 7-6(4), 6-7(8), 6-3. Auger-Aliassime let slip four match points in a nervy end to the second set, but responded with a clinical decider. Rublev leads Canada‚Äôs Auger-Aliassime 6-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, and he triumphed in their most recent meeting on clay in the 2024 Madrid championship match. In the opening match of the day, Tomas Martin Etcheverry eased past Jiri Lehecka 7-5, 6-3 to reach his maiden tour-level semi-final in 2025. Etcheverry dropped out of the Top 50 last month but can secure his return by lifting his maiden ATP Tour crown in Hamburg: The Argentine has risen two spots to No. 53 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings as a result of his run so far. Flavio Cobolli is the player standing between Etcheverry and a spot in the final at Am Rothenbaum. The Bucharest champion accelerated to a 7-6(4), 6-0 win against Roberto Bautista Agut to advance to the last four. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
