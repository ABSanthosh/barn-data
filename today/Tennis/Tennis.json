    "description": "Third time's the charm! Argentine Francisco Cerundolo earned his first Lexus ATP Head2Head win in three attempts against countryman Tomas Martin Etcheverry on Friday at the Movistar Chile Open, where the top seed is into the semi-finals. The 26-year-old rallied from a set down to oust the heavy-hitting Etcheverry 4-6, 6-3, 7-5. ‚ÄúToday was a really tough match,‚Äù said Cerundolo, who struck 31 winners, including 21 behind his forehand. ‚ÄúTomy is an incredible player, incredible fighter, incredible friend. He‚Äôs one of my best friends on Tour. It‚Äôs really difficult to play against him. ‚ÄúI think we both played really nervous today. We played well but I think we both were a little bit tight, nervous. I think we played a really good match and it was really close.‚ÄùIce-cold Francisco! ü•∂@FranCerundolo keeps his nerve in the all-üá¶üá∑ clash, defeating compatriot Etcheverry 4-6 6-3 7-5, to reach his 7‚É£th ATP Tour semi-final! üëè@chile_open | #MovistarChileOpen pic.twitter.com/AC85TzrZ92‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) February 28, 2025 Cerundolo created 14 break chances, converting 11, including a crucial break at 5-5 in the decider, allowing the No. 26 player in the PIF ATP Rankings to serve out the two-hour, 54-minute battle. The fifth seed Etcheverry defeated Cerundolo in Santiago two years ago en route to a final appearance. At last year's US Open, Etcheverry again overcame Cerundolo in five sets. Cerundolo will next face Serbian Laslo Djere, who ousted Jaime Faria 7-6(5), 4-6, 6-4 after two hours and 42 minutes. The 29-year-old saved 11 of the 14 break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
