Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/fonseca-australian-open-2025-behind-the-scenes",
    "description": "Stars are not born overnight. The best players in the game do not wake up one morning at the top of the sport. It takes years of hard work, dedication and, importantly, results. Often there is a moment of confirmation. Potential and promise boil over into breakthrough on a big stage. Think Roger Federer’s win against Pete Sampras at Wimbledon in 2001. Could Joao Fonseca's impressive win against Andrey Rublev on Tuesday evening at the Australian Open have been one of those moments? The 18-year-old Brazilian had already made his mark on the ATP Tour, surging to the Rio de Janeiro ATP 500 quarter-finals last year as a 17-year-old and later winning the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. The only other player to win the 20-and-under event and his next tournament after it was current World No. 1 Jannik Sinner. But if those were hurdles to clear, what came in the Australian Open draw was a different, more challenging kind of obstacle: 10-time major quarter-finalist Andrey Rublev. The teen had never faced a Top 10 player before. It would take more than a leap to clear this test. Could Fonseca raise his level to challenge such a consistent force? Would he be able to maintain his tennis in a best-of-five format? The Brazilian answered those questions with a resounding “yes”, beating Rublev 7-6(1), 6-3, 7-6(5), sending the Margaret Court Arena crowd into a frenzy. Yet when Fonseca walked out of the locker room at 12:24 a.m., you would never have been able to tell what the 18-year-old had just accomplished. Fonseca had just stepped into the spotlight on an international stage and acted no differently than he would have any other day. Christopher Kas, a former-player-turned coach, congratulated the Brazilian on his win as Kamil Majchrzak walked by. Otherwise, the player hallway in the depths of Rod Laver Arena was completely quiet. Security guards stood at attention, but otherwise there was a sense of calm. Fonseca answered questions in Portuguese as he ventured upstairs to meet the media. There was no entourage surrounding him, only two members of ATP staff. The phenom carried a sweatshirt and his Australian Open Waterdrop bottle. “I go in the big room?” Fonseca asked. “That’s too much for me.” The youngest player in the Top 200 cracked a smile. He was seemingly unfazed by what he had accomplished. Instead of taking the walk to reflect to himself on a huge victory, Fonseca was inquisitive, asking about the broadcast studios, media workroom and press conference rooms. “Hello,” Fonseca said to the media staffers in a jovial manner as he walked into the main interview room at 12:26 a.m. “Good to see you,” was how the Brazilian began his first English answer in response to a journalist. For nearly 10 minutes Fonseca fielded questions from the English-speaking media before transitioning to Portuguese. “Obrigado,” he said on the way out, later remarking how nice the room was. Watch Joao Fonseca's 'Journey to Jeddah' episode here: At 12:43 a.m. Fonseca walked into a studio to do an interview for the broadcasting world feed. The rest of the building’s third floor was silent. “I like those kinds of pressure,” Fonseca said. “This pressure, the opponents have more than me. Of course I was nervous because of the stadium, because I was playing against a really good player. But I like those difficult matches and [that] is where I play better.” Fonseca reminded the production crew that while this was the pair’s first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, the Brazilian had actually hit with Rublev at the 2023 Nitto ATP Finals, just more than a year ago. At that point, Fonseca was World No. 676. The 18-year-old asked Rublev for a t-shirt at the recent US Open. It is safe to say Fonseca is someone future players will be asking for shirts one day. On the way out of the studio, Fonseca, who is now inside the Top 100 of the PIF ATP Live Rankings, said two things: “Thank you everyone.” “See you… See you soon.” That was the first post-match world feed interview Fonseca conducted at the Australian Open and it certainly will be far from the last. After a short walk to an outdoor terrace, Fonseca began an interview with ESPN International at 12:54 a.m. Hundreds of birds flew in the air over Melbourne Park and the noise was not from fans, who had long ago departed, but the cleaning crew preparing the grounds for the next day. Just a few minutes later, Fonseca headed into the elevator to return to the players’ area of the facility. When he walked out of the elevator, the lights were off before automatically triggering. After a long day of tennis at the season’s first major, Fonseca was the last man standing. There is still work to be done. The #NextGenATP star will face Italian veteran Lorenzo Sonego on Thursday evening with a place in the third round on the line. At 12:59 a.m., Fonseca shook hands with the two staffers who had spent the previous 35 minutes with him and walked through the sliding doors back towards the locker room. Long gone were the raucous fans and the intensity of the spotlight he experienced just a few hours prior. But what they saw on court was exactly the same person in the tunnels of Rod Laver Arena hours later: a humble prodigy who sees himself the same as anyone else around him. Fonseca is just a boy from Rio de Janeiro living his dream.

    "title": "The never-ending evolution of Learner Tien",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/tien-australian-open-2025-feature",
    "description": "Eric Diaz remembers seeing Learner Tien for the first time when the lefty was 14 years old. There was an “aura” around him from a young age, which later helped Tien win the USTA Boys' 18s National Hard Court Championships twice, aged 16 and 17. “Everybody anticipated some big things for him, but he was just a quiet kid, so it was always one of those where I was always kind of [thinking], ‘He's young, you never know’,” Diaz said. “But the more I got to know him, the more I recognised that the aura was there for a reason.” Some players are known for their forehand or backhand and others their serve. Tien, who last month made the final at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, has made his brand not based on a shot or attribute. He is simply a winner. Case in point: Tien’s first-round match at the Australian Open. It was a high-pressure environment for the 19-year-old, who was competing in his first major outside of the US Open and pursuing his maiden main draw victory at a Grand Slam tournament. Tien, a qualifier, was facing Camilo Ugo Carabelli, who has never won a tour-level match on hard courts. But the American hit 16 double faults, forcing him to dig deep in a five-set clash that took nearly four hours. He only converted seven of 20 break points according to Infosys Stats, but got the job done to earn a second-round showdown with former World No. 1 Daniil Medvedev, which will take place Thursday evening inside Margaret Court Arena. “The kid's a winner and he just finds different ways,” Diaz said. “A lot of guys, I think, when they have that type of day and you're just double faulting, I think a lot of guys would probably let it get the best of them. He just stays really calm and just finds a way.” Tien told ATPTour.com: “It definitely feels good to know that you found a way, even in not the most ideal circumstances that you would want. But it's a good feeling, honestly, to problem solve and find a way through a match where you don't feel your best, maybe, and you know things are going wrong. So I take a good bit of confidence from it. I enjoy it.” One year ago Tien was No. 473 in the PIF ATP Rankings and hit a roadblock when he missed more than three months due to a seventh-rib fracture. The Californian won the first 28 matches following his comeback at the end of May and never looked back. He qualified for Jeddah, the premium 20-and-under season finale, and is now No. 107 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. “I think it's been amazing. I've been doing better than I could have hoped for if you told me this would happen a year ago. I try to take it all in because obviously the wins are so much better than the losses,” Tien said. “I try to enjoy them as much as I can. When you're winning, it's great. I personally don't really appreciate the winning as much until I lose, and it's like, ‘Wow, this is definitely a lot worse than two days ago, when I was winning’. “I think just taking it in [is important] and being grateful for the success that I've had, and I guess not being satisfied with what I've had. And obviously [I am] pushing for more, but taking it all in and enjoying it as much as I can.” Tien, Diaz and the rest of the team are not content with the success. They know that he is only a teen with a long road ahead and to climb to the top of the sport requires constant improvement and evolution. That is why the group has continued honing Tien’s game despite all the winning he has done in the past seven months. “I think sometimes when you're winning and having success, it can be hard to tweak things, just because you feel like it's working right now, why would I change it? But I've always had a pretty good mindset about it,” Tien said. “I like the fact that I still feel like I have stuff to work on and improve, just because if I didn't, that means I'd be at my ceiling right now. “It's honestly nice for me to know that there's a lot of stuff that I can still improve, and that I'm having the success with some flaws that could be fixed.” [ATP APP] Diaz explained that they have changed “a handful of things” in Tien’s game including work on his serve and forehand. “It's one of those things where some days it's great, other days it's not. His second round of qualies, he hit 16 aces, two double faults. So pretty different than today. But for him to be able to win while not having a very good serve day, I think says a lot about his mentality and everything else,” Diaz said. “It's just constant evolution. So he's trying to do some different stuff with his feet, some different stuff with his hands. Some days it's good. Some days it's not. Toss today was a little off. But that's how it goes when you're playing one of the biggest matches of your life and things aren't going perfectly, and you still find a way to win. It's a good thing.” According to Tien, he is hitting his serve better now than ever before. Part of that has to do with the small changes he has been making to his motion, timing and tempo. “I've been tweaking my serve a good bit… But still a lot of room to improve, and a lot of things that could still get better,” Tien said. “So it's nice to have some good serving days and know that there's still a lot more room to improve. I think that's probably been the biggest area of focus for me for a while, and it's coming along.” Tien is conscious of not having too much of an ego and allowing the winning he has been doing to prevent him from working on his game. And as Diaz said, \"you are never where you want to be\". “I think even when you're doing well, there are always bigger dreams or bigger hopes or bigger tournaments and stuff like that,” Diaz said. “So I think he's done well with having a really long-term vision. There's never really been a moment like, 'Oh, I'm too good to be working on anything', which is great.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
