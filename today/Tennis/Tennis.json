Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "The Andrey Rublev Foundation has partnered with Bambino Gesu Children’s Hospital in Rome, one of the leading paediatric hospitals in the world, to support medical care for underprivileged children. In April, Rublev visited the hospital ahead of the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Rome. There, he spent time with members of the medical staff and patients undergoing treatment. He also provided presents to the children. “We met a few kids at the hospital... Some of them [were] recovering from a tough surgery, some of them [were] waiting for surgeries,” said Rublev. The foundation is committed to supporting children from abroad facing serious or complex medical conditions and who require access to specialised treatment in Rome. “We are very excited to be partnering with the Bambino Gesu Children’s Hospital in Rome,” said Lisa Hernandez, the Director of the Andrey Rublev Foundation, which hopes to help as many children as possible. “We are going to be providing financial aid to international patients to come here and receive special treatment and get surgeries and hopefully make a difference for a couple of children around the world.” Rublev launched the Andrey Rublev Foundation in 2024. The foundation is dedicated to helping children in need by providing access to transformative care. Learn more about the foundation. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Justin Engel joined a select group on Tuesday when he defeated James Duckworth at the BOSS OPEN in Stuttgart. The 17-year-old German became the second-youngest player since 1990 to win a tour-level match (excluding Davis Cup) on all three surfaces: hard, clay and grass. Only Rafael Nadal accomplished the feat at a younger age, doing so at 17 years, two months. Youngest to earn tour-level win on all three surfaces (since 1990)  Player  Age  1) Rafael Nadal  17 years, 2 months  2) Justin Engel   17 years, 8 months  3) Alexander Zverev  18 years, 1 month  4) Lleyton Hewitt  18 years, 1 month  5) Carlos Alcaraz  18 years, 1 month Three of the top five players on the list — Nadal, Lleyton Hewitt and Carlos Alcaraz — have reached No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, while Alexander Zverev has climbed as high as World No. 2. Engel, who began the week at a career-high World No. 281, earned his first tour-level victory last October in Almaty (hard), before claiming his second win last month in Hamburg (clay) and his third on Tuesday on grass. The youngest player in the Open Era to triumph on all three surfaces is Michael Chang, who was 16 years old. Boris Becker is the only other 16-year-old to do it. Engel will try to win multiple matches at the same tour-level event for the first time on Thursday when he takes on seventh seed Alex Michelsen in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. According to Infosys ATP Stats, Engel hit 16 aces in his first-round win and will try to produce another good serving performance against the American. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
