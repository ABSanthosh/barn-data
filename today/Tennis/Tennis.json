It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Letâ€™s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic became just the sixth team in history to complete the â€˜Sunshine Doubleâ€™ on Saturday at the Miami Open presented by Itau, where they backed up their Indian Wells title by triumphing in Florida. The top seeds overcame British pair Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool 7-6(3), 6-3 to win the title in a rain-disrupted final. \"I think it was something special [the Sunshine Double], but it wasn't something I was even thinking about,\" Arevalo said. \"We have been playing well. In Indian Wells we did a great week, winning some matches. And we are super happy now we were able to win back-to-back titles here in the US.\" Celebrating with those that mean the most ðŸ«¶@MiamiOpen | #MiamiOpen pic.twitter.com/kNQiS6ZMhsâ€” ATP Tour (@atptour) March 29, 2025 Arevalo and Pavic did not drop a set en route to the trophy in Indian Wells but were made to work harder in Miami, where they earned Match Tie-break wins in three of their five victories. In a tight battle against sixth seeds Cash and Glasspool, Arevalo and Pavic were fast at the net, and strong on serve, winning 90 per cent (19/21) of their first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats to clinch the first set. After play was suspended for two hours due to rain at 7-6(3), 3-2, Arevalo and Pavic returned to immediately break before they closed out to seal victory after 78 minutes. \"We had a great year last year, finishing No. 1,\" Pavic said. \"We showed we could be at the top and doubles is an interesting game. It is very close so to achieve something like this is not easy. Winning a couple of matches helps boost your confidence and I think that was the edge that we had the past couple of matches.\" They have now won six titles together, including three ATP Masters 1000 crowns and Roland Garros, having teamed at the start of 2024. With his latest triumph, Pavic clinched his 41st tour-level crown, with no active doubles player earning more. Marcelo Melo is second on the list with 39. The El Salvador-Croatian team is the first pair to win the â€˜Sunshine Doubleâ€™ since Frenchmen Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut in 2016. John Isner won both titles in 2022 but with different partners. 'Sunshine Double' Team WinnersÂ  Arevalo/PavicÂ  2025 Herbert/Mahut 2016 Bryan/Bryan 2014 Knowles/Nestor 2002 Black/Stolle 1999 Woodbridge/Woodforde 1996 Cash and Glasspool were trying to win their first Masters 1000 title together. Earlier this season they won events in Brisbane and Doha and were impressive at the hard-court event in Florida, losing just one set en route to the final. They leave Miami fourth in the PIF ATP Doubles Team Rankings, with Arevalo and Pavic second. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
