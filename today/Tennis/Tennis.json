Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten turned missed opportunities into a memorable comeback Saturday, when they claimed their second major title at the Australian Open. The Finnish-British duo squandered 10 set points in the opening set, yet dug deep to defeat Italians Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori 6-7(16), 7-6(5), 6-3 after three hours, four minutes. \"What an evening,\" Patten said in relief during the trophy presentation. \"What an amazing match. For Harri, what a journey we've been on. It's truly been special so let's keep it going.\" CHAMPS DOWN UNDER üëë Heliovaara \u0026 Patten take the championship in Melbourne üèÜ#AO2025 pic.twitter.com/Rad2nYHpHX ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) January 25, 2025 Heliovaara added: \"Could I have done it without you, Henry? I don't think so. It's a team sport in doubles. The most important thing is to find yourself a good partner and I've succeeded in that. Not only on the tennis court, we are such good friends. I think that's what keeps us close together on the court and brings us titles like this.\" Heliovaara and Patten held three consecutive set points on return at 6-5, 0/40 in the opening set before Bolelli and Vavassori tallied five straight points and forced a tie-break. The thrilling first set lasted 87 minutes. \"I lost count how many set points we have, and that doesn't happen often. Usually I'm pretty good with math,\" Heliovaara said. \"I told our coach, Calvin, I went to approach him during the set break when they took a toilet break, and we can go talk to [our] coach. I said to Calvin, 'I still believe we are the better team on court'. \"Sometimes it just doesn't go your way. We had break points on five of their service games, and they just managed to get out of almost everything.\" However, the sixth seeds earned tie-break revenge in the second set, sending the match into a decider. They built upon their momentum by earning a key break in their opening return game of the third set, racing to a 3-0 lead and rarely looking back. The lefty Patten served out the championship, fighting off two break points before sealing the trophy. Heliovaara and Patten won last year‚Äôs Wimbledon title in what was their first major event as a team. They claimed four tour-level trophies in 2024 and reached the Nitto ATP Finals semi-finals. \"I think it's boring that it comes down to a lot of practice. We play a lot of tennis, and we're always in those competitive situations. That's even when we're practising,\" Patten said. \"I've said it before, but I have full faith and knowledge that Harri is going to absolutely compete his heart out every single point until the end of the match, and I think he thinks the same of me as well, no matter what the situation is.\" Bolelli and Vavassori were on a nine-match winning streak entering the final, having won the ATP 250 in Adelaide to start the season. The Italians leave Melbourne as runner-ups for the second consecutive year. Did You Know? Heliovaara is the first Finnish player in history to win multiple Grand Slam men‚Äôs doubles titles. Patten is the third British player in the Open Era to win the Australian Open men‚Äôs doubles title (Jamie Murray, Joe Salisbury). [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Eighth seed Henry Bernet became the first Swiss player to win an Australian Open junior singles title on Saturday when he defeated American Benjamin Willwerth 6-3, 6-4 to claim the boys‚Äô crown. The teen achieved the feat on his 18th birthday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been probably three perfect weeks here. Today on my birthday I had the chance to play on the Rod Laver Arena, which is something very special,‚Äù Bernet said. ‚ÄúI will never forget that, even if I would have lost the match. But it's even better that I won the match. I'm just very happy.‚Äù The Swiss became the sixth boy from his country to earn a major junior singles title, joining Roger Federer, Stan Wawrinka, Heinz Gunthardt, Roman Valent and Dominic Stricker. ‚ÄúIt makes me very happy and proud, too,‚Äù Bernet said. ‚ÄúIt's a great achievement for me. I'm really just trying to focus on my own journey, too. Yes, it just makes it very special. I hope that I can continue the year like this.‚Äù Bernet met Federer last year at the US Open and ‚Äúwould love to talk to him again‚Äù. Fittingly, the Australian Open boys‚Äô champion also has a one-handed backhand, like Federer and Wawrinka. ‚ÄúI was just practising with my coach in the club. I was always struggling with my two-hander,‚Äù Bernet said. ‚ÄúHe was like, more or less as a joke, ‚ÄòLet's try a one-hander‚Äô. It felt natural. It looked natural. That was the point where I decided to play the one-hander. Just developed well so far.‚Äù At last year‚Äôs Swiss Indoors Basel, Bernet played doubles with countryman Jerome Kym. The Swiss players defeated Nicolas Jarry and Alejandro Tabilo. Bernet also won a qualifying round against Fabio Fognini. ‚ÄúI think that helped me, too, to kind of already have a picture in my mind how it's going to work out,‚Äù Bernet said of previously playing on a big court. ‚ÄúI think I started pretty well. I got the two breaks. From there on, I could build up.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
