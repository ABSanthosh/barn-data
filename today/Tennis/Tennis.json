It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "title": "In Memoriam: Hall of famer Fred Stolle",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/fred-stolle-obituary",
    "description": "Legendary Australian player, coach, and commentator Fred ‚ÄúFiery‚Äù Stolle, winner of 19 major titles and a 1985 International Tennis Hall of Fame inductee, died on March 5th at the age of 86. One of the remarkable cadre of Australians who dominated tennis from 1950-75, Stolle was renowned for his bullet serves, crisp volleys, sharp service returns and superb court sense. Like all of his compatriots, Stolle had a nickname ‚Äì ‚ÄúFiery,‚Äù an ode to everything from his competitive tenacity to penchant for candor. But while such Australian greats as Ken Rosewall and Lew Hoad were precocious, touted prodigies, Stolle‚Äôs career arc was just the opposite ‚Äì a late-bloomer who often thrived on being underestimated. One signature moment came in the 1964 Davis Cup Challenge Round. A year earlier, despite clearly being Australia‚Äôs second-best player, Stolle had been left off the team ‚Äì and Australia had been beaten that year by the United States. But in ‚Äô64, he was a mainstay of the team all year long. In the Challenge Round versus the U.S., Australia went behind 2-1, one defeat away from losing the Cup for the second year in a row. Stolle took on Dennis Ralston and won the first two sets. Ralston rallied to even the match and then broke Stolle at 1-1 in the fifth. On the changeover, Stolle told Aussie captain Harry Hopman, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to break right back and even up the match, and then I‚Äôm going to win it.‚Äù That he did ‚Äì 7-5, 6-3, 3-6, 9-11, 6-4. With the tie now levelled, Stolle‚Äôs doubles partner, Roy Emerson, went on to take the decider. Once again, the Davis Cup made its way Down Under. Stolle also starred on Australia‚Äôs winning teams in ‚Äô65 and ‚Äô66. [ATP APP] Months after that big Davis Cup victory, Stolle won his first major singles title. Remarkably, it came not on the grass where he was so comfortable, but on the clay at Roland-Garros. By early 1965, Stolle had lost five major singles finals, but that year in Paris he earned a long-due breakthrough victory, beating fellow Australian Tony Roche in a four-set final. Even still, a year later, despite having finished ‚Äò65 ranked No. 3 in the world, Stolle was unseeded at the U.S. Nationals (what‚Äôs now the US Open). ‚ÄúI did not appreciate the snub and took the whole matter rather personally,‚Äù Stolle wrote in his 1985 memoir, Tennis Down Under. ‚ÄúBy the time we reached New York, my dander was up and I went into the tournament very motivated to make a good showing and prove a point.‚Äù Having made his way to the semis without the loss of a set, Stolle then played one of the best matches of his career to beat Emerson in straight sets. In the finals, Stolle won a tight four-setter over his compatriot, John Newcombe. ‚ÄúWell, I guess the Old Hacker can still play a bit,‚Äù said Stolle following the most satisfying of his 33 singles title runs. In addition to singles triumphs at Roland-Garros and the U.S. Nationals, Stolle won 10 men‚Äôs doubles majors (three Australian, two at Roland-Garros, two Wimbledon and three U.S.) and seven mixed (two Australian, three Wimbledon, two U.S.). Though his best singles days were over by the early ‚Äò70s, Stolle remained a force in doubles for many more years. Twice in his 40s, Stolle reached the semis at the US Open, including a run in 1981 with Newcombe that thrilled fans with its mix of friendly humor and lively net play. Fred Stolle was born on October 8, 1938 in Sydney. His father, Bill, worked for the railroad, and was a fine tennis player. Inspired by Bill, Fred took to the game, learning to play on a makeshift asphalt court. Tennis in the ‚Äò40s in Australia was largely a middle-class sport, highly accessible to boys and girls of all ages. But while many promising Australian juniors were given jobs by sporting goods companies that allowed them ample time for tennis, Stolle never received such an offer. Instead, at 14, he went to work as a bank teller. Not until Stolle turned 21 did he have the chance to travel overseas and compete. Stolle‚Äôs skill was apparent rapidly, particularly on his second trip to Wimbledon, where, in 1961, Stolle won the mixed doubles title and reached the men‚Äôs doubles final. Making a seamless transition into a career as a coach, Stolle held jobs in Tucson and the Miami area. His most notable charge was Vitas Gerulaitis, the two working together from 1977-83. Like Stolle, Gerulaitis was a Hopman-trained net-rusher. Alongside Stolle, Gerulaitis enjoyed his best years, in 1978 reaching a career-high ranking of No. 3 in the world. Stolle often referred to Gerulaitis as his second son. Quite remarkably, Stolle‚Äôs first son, Sandon, won 22 ATP doubles titles, including the 1998 US Open. That achievement made the Stolles the only father and son duo to have each earned Grand Slam championships. In addition to his work as teacher and coach, for more than 40 years, Stolle was one of the sport‚Äôs premier broadcasters, working for such outlets as America‚Äôs ESPN and Australia‚Äôs Channel Nine. In the United States, his partnership with Cliff Drysdale became an iconic, must-listen commentary for tennis aficionados. One of the highest forms of praise one tennis player can give to another is to say, ‚ÄúHe lived his life in the game.‚Äù You‚Äôd be hard-pressed to find someone who personified this premise more than Fred Stolle. He is survived by his wife, Pat; children, Sandon, Monique, and Nadine. Editor's Note: This story was reproduced with permission from the International Tennis Hall of Fame. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/fonseca-fearnley-indian-wells-2025-thursday",
    "description": "Joao Fonseca added a maiden BNP Paribas Open win to his breakout 2025 season on Thursday, but only after pulling through a stern first-round test from Jacob Fearnley in Indian Wells. The #NextGenATP Brazilian Fonseca prevailed 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 in a topsy-turvy battle against Great Britain‚Äôs Fearnley. In windy conditions, the 18-year-old trailed 1-3 in the deciding set but then reeled off five straight games to earn his second ATP Masters 1000 match win and his first on a hard court. Putting his foot on the gas üöò Huge hitting from Joao Fonseca! @BNPPARIBASOPEN | #TennisParadise pic.twitter.com/xyQMrWN2pS ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) March 6, 2025 ‚ÄúI think it was a great debut,‚Äù said Fonseca. ‚ÄúIt was very difficult to play here. It was windy, and I think it‚Äôs the biggest court I played on so far, so I‚Äôm just very excited about the way that I played today. I‚Äôm very happy with the way that I fought. I was a break down in the third, things were not very good for me, and I continued focusing on my game, so I‚Äôm very happy.‚Äù With his two-hour victory in Indian Wells, Fonseca set an intriguing second-round clash with 13th seed Jack Draper, whom the Brazilian will aim to upset to continue his recent rapid rise: Within the past three months, Fonseca has triumphed at the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF and lifted his maiden tour-level title in Buenos Aires, either side of upsetting Andrey Rublev for his first main-draw win at a major at the Australian Open. [HOT SHOT] Despite the blustery California desert conditions, Fonseca started quickly in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Fearnley. He broke the Briton in the opening game of the match and that proved enough for the Brazilian to claim the first set. Just one spot separates World No. 80 Fonseca and No. 81 Fearnley in the PIF ATP Rankings, and the latter soon gave a reminder of his own recent progress with a classy second-set showing. The Scot, who was outside the Top 500 a year ago, put together a five-game streak featuring some pure baseline hitting to level the match. Fearnley subsequently rode his momentum to an early break in the deciding set, but he then produced a couple of crucial errors on serve. Firstly, he double-faulted to hand Fonseca a break back for 3-3, and he later sent an easy volley long at 3-4, 40/40 in a game in which his opponent secured a second, decisive break of the set. Fonseca wrapped his seventh tour-level triumph of the season having won four of seven break points he earned, according to Infosys ATP Stats. His victory was greeted with delight by the Stadium 1 crowd, many of whom had gathered at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden to cheer on one of the ATP Tour‚Äôs brightest young stars. ‚ÄúI just love playing with a crowd, so the support from them is very nice,‚Äù said Fonseca. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an honour seeing kids inspired by me, so just being here with them makes me more excited to play.‚Äù Another #NextGenATP star, Jakub Mensik, enjoyed a more straightforward first-round win on Thursday afternoon in California. The 19-year-old Czech downed Tomas Martin Etcheverry 6-4, 7-6(6) to reach the second round for the second consecutive year. Currently third in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah behind Fonseca and American Learner Tien, Mensik will face 22nd seed Karen Khachanov next in Indian Wells. Other early winners on Day 2 included Jenson Brooksby, who downed Benjamin Bonzi 1-6, 7-5, 7-5 for his first tour-level win since the 2023 Australian Open, and Gabriel Diallo, who saved two match points before overcoming Zhang Zhizhen 2-6, 6-2, 7-6(7).
