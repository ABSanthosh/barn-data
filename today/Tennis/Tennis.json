    "description": "Jannk Sinner hit new heights on Sunday evening, when he successfully defended his crown at the Australian Open. With an assured straight-sets victory over World No. 2 Alexander Zverev, Sinner continues to assert his dominance atop the PIF ATP Rankings. The three-time major winner has now won 37 of his past 38 matches, and his coach Simone Vagnozzi has the feeling that this is just the beginning of a lengthy period of success. ‚ÄúHe's still young, he has already won three [Grand Slam] tournaments,‚Äù Vagnozzi said of Sinner in a media conference on Sunday. ‚ÄúYou never know what's going to happen in the future, but for sure he is a guy that tries to improve every day, goes on court, in practice, and tries to put new things on his game, tries to improve physically. ‚ÄúI think he's one of the guys that can reach the top level. When we speak about the top level, we think about Novak [Djokovic], about Roger [Federer] or Rafa [Nadal]. We are still a long way, but for sure is one of the guys that can try to reach this kind of player.‚Äù The happiness in this photo ü•∞#AO2025 pic.twitter.com/SdWQLx62J5 ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) January 26, 2025 The remarkable potential that Vagnozzi sees in Sinner is perhaps one of the key factors behind their success together. Vagnozzi began working with Sinner in 2022, when the Italian was 20, and has witnessed firsthand his player's journey to becoming the first Italian to reach No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Yet there lies a notable difference between the man that rallied past Daniil Medvedev from two-sets-to-love down in last year‚Äôs final in Melbourne and the man who dispatched the World No. 2 in two hours, 42 minutes without facing a single break point. ‚ÄúFor sure, it‚Äôs different,‚Äù Vagnozzi said when asked about Sinner‚Äôs approach to the two finals 12 months apart. ‚ÄúFor sure you see [him] with a little more confidence, with more calm. Also, you know that you already have two trophies at home, so it's a little bit different. [He] also knows better how to manage some moments of the match. ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs a completely different player. He has more confidence on his serve. He has more confidence in how he's playing tactically in the match. All these kinds of things make the difference to win this type of tournament. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an unbelievable talent, a really unbelievable talent. Mentally he is really, really strong. When he wants something, he tries to do as best he can. Sometimes when someone speaks about Jannik, they speak just about his groundstrokes or his power. But for me, as a coach, when you ask him something, he's able to do it quite fast.‚Äù Sinner grew into his title defence in Melbourne as the tournament wore on, and in typically clinical fashion, he saved the best until last. The 23-year-old did not drop a set from the quarter-finals on, and was ruthless in the championship match, where he saw off Zverev for the second consecutive time to move to 3-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. ‚ÄúI think he played the best match so far in the tournament,‚Äù Vagnozzi said of the final. ‚ÄúI think after the semi-final someone asked me why he always plays the best tennis in difficult moments. For sure today was a really important moment, and he went on court and he played the best tennis. He likes to be in this position.‚Äù Last year's Australian Open and US Open champion has now won 21 consecutive matches at the hard-court majors. Yet with fierce rival and World No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz claiming victory on the clay at Roland Garros and on the grass at Wimbledon last year, Sinner will be eager to taste Grand Slam success on the other surfaces. Vagnozzi believes that Sinner‚Äôs time is not far away. ‚ÄúFor sure his natural surface is hard court,‚Äù Vagnozzi explained. ‚ÄúLast year he played in the semis in Paris and quarters in Wimbledon. The year before the semis [at Wimbledon]. For sure clay may be a little bit more difficult. But he can play good also there I think, and he can also try to win Roland Garros. ‚ÄúI think Wimbledon last year he was a little bit unlucky because he was not 100 per cent the day that he lost to Medvedev, otherwise probably we had small chances also to win there in Wimbledon. I think we have a chance to be ready to try to win Paris and also Wimbledon. So we will see.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-australian-open-2025-final-reaction",
    "description": "Twelve months ago, Jannik Sinner captured his first major at the Australian Open. The Italian went on to climb to No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings and lift a further seven tour-level trophies in 2024. On Sunday, the 23-year-old successfully defended his title in Melbourne, where he defeated Alexander Zverev in the final. But how did Sinner find the experience of returning to a major as the top seed and the man to beat? ‚ÄúMaybe there was a little extra pressure and attention on your side, which you have to handle. But on the other hand, you know that you can do it because you've done it once. You try to understand whatever it is,‚Äù Sinner said in his post-match press conference. ‚ÄúWhat I understood this time is every day is different. You have days where you might not feel 100 per cent and then the next match all of a sudden, ‚ÄòOkay, I'm into the tournament‚Äô. I think I've learned many things throughout this one year, not all about the result, but how I am as a person and how I handle the situations on the court.‚Äù Everything added up to this moment.This is Jannik's time, and he's only just getting started üëä#ItAllAddsUp pic.twitter.com/Px5AJMnS6u‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) January 26, 2025 Sinner dropped just two sets en route to the title but faced difficulty against Holger Rune in the fourth round. The Italian was struggling with an illness during the fourth-round match but prevailed before he returned to full health to see off Alex de Minaur in the quarter-finals, Ben Shelton in the semis and Zverev in the final. Sinner holds a 22-4 record in Melbourne and enjoys competing at the hard-court major. The top seed produced some of his best tennis of the fortnight against Zverev, highlighted by his ability to win the second set under pressure. ‚ÄúIt was an amazing performance from my side,‚Äù Sinner said. ‚ÄúI felt like I was in the beginning of the match serving really well and trying to get into the zone very fast. It was very high-quality from my side. In the second set, I got a bit lucky in the tie-break, as we saw. ‚ÄúAll things considered, [it was an] amazing run again here in Australia. I'm extremely happy. Sharing this with the team here and family and the people I love, it's amazing.‚Äù Zverev, who was chasing his first major, was full of praise for Sinner in his press conference and compared the Italian to 24-time major champion Djokovic. The Italian was flattered by the German‚Äôs comments. ‚ÄúIt's an amazing compliment from Sascha,‚Äù Sinner said. ‚ÄúI think everyone is different in a way. Obviously I have some similarities with Novak's game style. I still believe when Novak plays at his best, it's very, very, very tough to beat him. ‚ÄúBut game style-wise I looked up to him, trying to understand what he's doing, how he handles the pressure moments, and important moments. I still believe we are different as players because everyone is different, but for sure we have similarities. The similarities are having a quite clean ball striking from the baseline, having a good movement, understanding a little bit where your opponent plays the ball.‚Äù Djokovic was forced to retire in his semi-final clash against Zverev due to a hamstring injury but Sinner had no such physical issues en route to his 19th tour-level title. The 23-year-old has won 37 of his past 38 matches and praised the work of his coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi in making him the player to beat on Tour. ‚ÄúHe's a very honest, honest person,‚Äù Sinner said on Cahill. ‚ÄúTo be a good coach with many different players, you have to understand the player and you have to get into the rhythm of the player, what he likes, what he doesn't like. It takes him just some weeks to get into that, and then he's there. ‚ÄúOne thing I really love about him is because he's very, very humble. He fits into the team very, very well. I tried also to make a good result for him here because being Australian, last Grand Slam as a coach. ‚ÄúBut I have to say we talk a lot about Darren, but it's also the Simone part, which is amazing what he's doing. He changed me as a player. He gave me so much confidence that I can do different stuff.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
