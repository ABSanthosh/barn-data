Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Tommy Paul earned his first ATP Tour win nine years ago in Houston as an 18-year-old. This year, the American is two victories from claiming his maiden tour-level title on clay at the same event. The top seed advanced to the semi-finals of the Fayez Sarofim \u0026 Co. U.S. Men‚Äôs Clay Court championship on Friday with a 6-1, 7-6(1) triumph against qualifier Colton Smith. ‚ÄúI came out playing my really well. I think maybe he was a little nervous and gave me a few free points, but then he locked it in there in the second set,‚Äù Paul said in his on-court interview. ‚ÄúBoth of us played high level. I'm glad we got to play a great match in front of you guys.‚Äù Next stop üîú Houston semi-finals! üôå@TommyPaul1 gets past Smith 6-1 7-6(1).@mensclaycourt | #USClay pic.twitter.com/PC09NDY19W ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) April 4, 2025 Paul has become friends with Smith, who is still a student-athlete at the University of Arizona. They even went fishing together earlier in the week. But on the court, it was the four-time ATP Tour titlist Paul who showed his experience in a one, hour, 29-minute victory. Despite landing just 47 per cent of his serves, the winner claimed 80 per cent of his service points overall according to Infosys ATP Stats. The No. 13 player in the PIF ATP Rankings started the week with a 2-3 record in the Houston ATP 250.But he has made a huge jump in level since his debut at the tournament nearly a decade ago. ‚ÄúI just have a little bit more experience,‚Äù Paul said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been out here a little longer, and it took me a really long time to make my first semi-final here. But I feel like we've made a lot of improvements in my game, and I'm excited for the next matchup.‚Äù ¬† That clash will be with qualifier Jenson Brooksby, who rallied past Aleksandar Kovacevic 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 in two hours and 21 minutes. The World No. 507 had already escaped match point in two matches ‚Äî¬†one in each of qualifying and the main draw. ‚ÄúI think I was able to really stay calm and crawl back like in my previous matches, just regroup,‚Äù said Brooksby, who will try to earn his first Lexus ATP Head2Head win against Paul. ‚ÄúAnd it made all the difference today.‚Äù The All-American quarter-finals continued when Brandon Nakashima eliminated Christopher Eubanks 6-4, 6-4 behind a dominant serving performance. The fourth seed won 74 per cent of his second-serve points and did not face a break point against Eubanks. Nakashima, who will next try to make his first clay-court ATP Tour final, is up to No. 31 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. ‚ÄúI thought it was a very good performance from me,‚Äù Nakashima said. ‚ÄúVery difficult conditions out here today and with Chris there are not going to be many rallies and you know he‚Äôs going to hit some good serves, so just tried to take care of my serve and I‚Äôm happy the way I played.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "After recording consecutive ATP Tour match victories for the first time since last July this week at the Grand Prix Hassan II, Luciano Darderi has stretched his winning streak to three to reach the Marrakech semi-finals. The seventh-seeded Italian beat Vit Kopriva 7-5, 6-2 on Friday at the ATP 250 to advance to his fourth tour-level semifinal (1-2), with each one coming on clay. Darderi, who could return to the Top 50 in the PIF ATP Rankings with second ATP Tour title (Cordoba 2024), improved to 14-0 on his favoured surface against players outside the Top 100. The 23-year-old saved five of six break points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and hit five aces in his 10 service games. He broke Kopriva's serve four times on 14 chances. Next up for Darderi is a semi-final matchup with fifth seed Roberto Carballes Baena, who advanced past fourth seed Nuno Borges 6-4, 6-4. The 32-year-old Spaniard is into his fourth Marrakech semi-final, having won the event in 2023 and reached the final last season. Top seed Tallon Griekspoor also advanced on Friday with a 6-3, 6-4 victory against eighth seed Mattia Bellucci. Through to his first clay-court semi-final on the ATP Tour (and his ninth overall), the 28-year-old is the second Dutchman to reach the semi-finals in tournament history, after Sjeng Schalken in 1995. He is also the first top seed to make the semis at the event since Stan Wawrinka in 2013, when it was held in Casablanca. Polish qualifier Kamil Majchrzak is next up for Griekspoor after his 7-5, 6-4 upset of third seed Alexandre Muller on Friday evening. Majchrzak earned his third Top 50 win to advance to his second ATP Tour semi-final, after reaching that stage in Pune in 2022. All four of Friday's Marrakech quarter-finals were the first Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings between the competitors. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
