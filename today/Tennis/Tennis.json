Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/daniil-medvedev-it-all-adds-up",
    "description": "Daniil Medvedev is where tactical genius meets competitive fire. The 28-year-old has established himself as a consistent presence at the top of the ATP Tour. Known for his razor-sharp tactics and steely consistency, it all has added up to a memorable career, with plenty more to go.         View this post on Instagram                       A post shared by ATP Tour (@atptour) As a typically philosophical player, who never shies away from the truth, on or off the court, Medvedev has garnered the respect of his peers and fans alike. A master of adaptability, the 2020 Nitto ATP Finals champion has redefined what it means to stay at the top in today’s highly competitive field. Stay on their minds Medvedev is a mental puzzle that few players have managed to solve. With a style designed to disrupt rhythm and force opponents to second-guess their strategies, Medvedev is always a step ahead. Nowhere is this better exemplified than in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Alexander Zverev, in which Medvedev has won 11 of their previous 13 meetings. Stay consistent Consistency is the hallmark of greatness, and Medvedev’s record speaks for itself. A mainstay in the Top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings since he first broke into in 2019, Medvedev has accumulated 20 tour-level titles in his career, including a US Open triumph in 2021. His ability to reproduce his best tennis year after year is underpinned by his relationship with the Nitto ATP Finals, the prestigious season finale that he has conquered once and made six consecutive appearances at. Stay the one to watch Medvedev’s unorthodox game style makes him one of the most unpredictable players in the sport. With his incredible rally tolerance and ability to turn defence into attack, one can never quite predict what he will do next. Whether it’s a daring passing shot from downtown or salvaging victory from the brink of defeat, Medvedev ensures he is always the player fans and opponents alike keep an eye on. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Shang Juncheng is no ordinary 19-year-old. The tremendous teen with a flashy lefty game is already making waves in the tennis world, firmly establishing himself as one of the ATP Tour’s most exciting prospects. As a beacon for the sport’s growth in China, and across the world, Shang is already setting an example even though his journey has just begun.          View this post on Instagram                       A post shared by ATP Tour (@atptour) Shang has displayed the grit and determination needed to break barriers and pave a new path that countless more will follow. Be the underdog Shang has had little trouble rising to the occasion throughout his fledgling career. Not only has he been forced to compete against the big names on Tour, but Shang has also carried the weight of expectations that comes with being a trailblazer for Chinese tennis. In October 2024, Shang became the first player born in 2005 or later to crack the Top 50 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Be China’s youngest champ The first taste of title success for Shang came on home soil in Chengdu, where he ousted top seed and World No. 19 Lorenzo Musetti in the final to become just the second Chinese player, and the youngest, to lift a trophy on the ATP Tour. By also becoming the first player born in 2005 or later to triumph, Shang further outlined his credentials as one of the Tour’s hottest emerging talents. Be a history maker The significance of Shang’s achievements — those he has achieved at an age when others are still finding their feet on the Tour — extends far beyond the court. In a country with a burgeoning tennis fanbase, his rise symbolises a breakthrough moment for Chinese tennis on a global stage. As he continues to climb towards the top of the sport, Shang is not just making history; he is inspiring the next generation to follow in his footsteps. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
