Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Jenson Brooksby fended off three consecutive match points Wednesday to reach the quarter-finals of the Fayez Sarofim \u0026 Co. U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship. The American overcame third seed Alejandro Tabilo 3-6, 6-4, 7-6(6) after a two-hour, 49-minute battle in blustery conditions. On the brink of defeat at 3/6 in the deciding-set tie-break, World No. 507 Brooksby swung freely and tallied five consecutive points to become the lowest-ranked quarter-finalist in Houston tournament history.Making his mark in Houston üôåJenson Brooksby is quarter-final bound after an impressive 3-6 6-4 7-6(6) victory over Tabilo. @mensclaycourt | #USClay pic.twitter.com/08kuqOnBCU‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) April 2, 2025 Brooksby also saved a match point in his first-round qualifying match Saturday against Federico Agustin Gomez. Against Tabilo, the former World No. 33 in the PIF ATP Rankings held a match point on return at 6-5 but ultimately navigated a rollercoaster tie-break, converting his second match point to win his first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with the Chilean. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still a little bit shocked,‚Äù Brooksby said in his on-court interview. ‚ÄúThat was a lot of back and forth. I knew he was a great competitor and I knew it would be a battle out here. I think it kind of reminded me of my first match here. You can just never quit until it‚Äôs the last point.‚Äù Tabilo, who secured an early break in the final set, will rue a loose service game when serving for the match at 5-4. In the decider, Brooksby dropped just three points behind his first serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Brooksby, 24, will next face Aleksandar Kovacevic or Frenchman Corentin Denolly.Brooksby‚Äôs fellow American Colton Smith also advanced to the last eight. Smith, competing in just his second tour-level event, defeated Ethan Quinn 6-3, 6-4. Having advanced through qualifying, Smith has not dropped serve across four matches. The 22-year-old has saved all six break points he has faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats.A standout senior at the University of Arizona, Smith is up to No. 165 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

    "description": "Alexandre Muller‚Äôs 2025 surge shows little sign of stopping at the Grand Prix Hassan II. The third-seeded Frenchman on Wednesday overcame Hugo Dellien 6-7(5), 6-1, 6-4 in Marrakech to reach his third ATP Tour quarter-final of the season. Muller, who is competing this week at a career-high No. 41 in the PIF ATP Rankings, converted five of 13 break points he earned during his two-hour, 26-minute win, according to Infosys ATP Stats. ‚ÄúIt was a little bit difficult to play today, it was really windy,‚Äù said Muller in his on-court interview. ‚ÄúI just tried to focus and to really want to win the match. That was the key today, so I‚Äôm happy to get the win. I think between the first half and the second half, I really focused on myself and did not focus on the conditions and everything. In the first set I was focused too much on it. By the end, I think I was playing quite well.‚Äù The 28-year-old Muller began 2025 by lifting his maiden ATP Tour trophy in Hong Kong, while in February he reached the biggest championship match of his career in Rio de Janeiro. Now 11-6 for the season, he will take on Kamil Majchrzak in the Marrakech quarter-finals. The Polish qualifier later defeated Jesper de Jong 7-6(3), 6-1. Also on Wednesday, the 2023 champion and 2024 finalist Roberto Carballes Baena improved on his stellar recent record in Marrakech by powering to a 6-4, 6-4 triumph against Otto Virtanen. The Spaniard earned two break of serve in each set to prevail in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Virtanen. He will meet Portugal's Nuno Borges in the quarter-finals.

The 28-year-old has won seven consecutive final-set tie-breaks at Tour level, dating back to May 2023. ‚ÄúI played an unbelievable tie-break, I think it was the best tie-break I‚Äôve ever played,‚Äù Borges said, cracking a large smile. In first-round action, Luciano Darderi and Vit Kopriva kick-started their respective Marrakech campaigns. Seventh seed Darderi downed Tristan Boyer 6-4, 6-4 to set a meeting with Hugo Gaston, while Kopriva defeated Borna Gojo 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 to advance to face second seed Lorenzo Sonego.
