It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/ruud-madrid-2025-final-reaction",
    "description": "Time and time again, Casper Ruud has positioned himself for glory at the world’s biggest events. The Norwegian had made two major finals, two ATP Masters 1000 championship matches and the final showdown at the Nitto ATP Finals. Each time, he fell just short. Not Sunday. Not at the Mutua Madrid Open, where finally the 26-year-old made his breakthrough. Ruud battled past Jack Draper in a hard-fought three-setter to claim the biggest trophy of his career. “My record in big finals is still not good, it's 1-6,” Ruud said. “I’ve been in many unbelievable and incredible positions in my career, and I've been able to experience some great things and, unfortunately, have been on the losing spectrum of many of those matches, but that's okay. “In many ways, my career has gone better than maybe I thought was possible sometimes. Of course I always dreamed about winning tournaments like this or Grand Slams or becoming World No. 1, and I've been fairly close.” Watch Extended Final Highlights: Ruud made clear it has not been the case that he has “choked” leads away. His opponents in those finals were Carlos Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Stefanos Tsitsipas. “I’ve just played [opponents] that were better than me, and I've tried to learn from that, and I think that one day there will come another opportunity and maybe I can seize it and, I guess, that was the key to the victory today,” Ruud said. “Jack is an incredible player, and he will only get better and better, and I knew that based on the previous six losses that if I don't bring my A game, I have nothing to do there on court, so that was the mentality.” It was the first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting between Ruud and Draper, and both entered the final with various levels of momentum. Ruud began his Mutua Madrid Open in 24th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, while Draper was as confident as ever following his maiden Masters 1000 triumph at Indian Wells. “If you look at my year this year, there's been one really good tournament, which was Dallas, where I reached a final, and other than that, it's been earlier losses than I hoped, more losses than I hoped,” Ruud said. “But it's a long season, and I have tried to think about that. It's like a marathon, not a sprint, kind of that saying. “The clay season is, I love it, but it's not that long. So I lost earlier than I wanted in Monte-Carlo and Barcelona, and the tournaments, the weeks, they go on, and if you don't do well, you kind of feel like, ‘Oh, I need to do well now’.” A MASTERS 1000 CHAMPION FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME 🤩@mutuamadridopen | #MMOpen pic.twitter.com/HeN6OWQqA1 — ATP Tour (@atptour) May 4, 2025 Ruud suffered early exits in Monte-Carlo and Barcelona for his standards, winning just three of five matches across the two events. But he has been working hard in the background to turn things around. “Since Roland Garros last year, I've had quite many months of struggling and not many good results, so it's worth the wait,” Ruud said. “I think I've accepted that I've had to, or I took one or two steps back in my game and my feelings on court in order to take two or three steps forward again. Here in Madrid it feels like I've taken four steps forward, so that's a great feeling.” Now Ruud is fifth in the Live Race and carrying confidence into another Masters 1000 event in Rome. Clay has long been the Norwegian’s haven and with a trophy from the Caja Magica, he is ready to attack the rest of the clay-court season. “I will enjoy this tonight and prepare as well as I can for Rome in the coming days, and then after Rome, I'm entered for Geneva, and then after that, we'll see how it goes in Paris,” Ruud said. “But there's still some really exciting weeks coming up, and I guess a win here shows the other players also that I'm here to try to do well for the rest of the clay season.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/draper-madrid-2025-final-reaction",
    "description": "Jack Draper fell agonisingly short of the title on Sunday evening at the Mutua Madrid Open, but the British lefty is already preparing to utilise that pain in his bid for further success in 2025. Speaking after his three-set defeat to Casper Ruud in the final at the clay-court ATP Masters 1000, the 23-year-old Draper was understandably disappointed. Yet he was also positive that his championship-match experience in the Spanish capital will only benefit him in the long run. “Of course, just fresh off losing a really tough match in a final, it really hurts,” said Draper. “But at the same time, I think I've enjoyed a lot of really good successes here. I've come through a lot of matches, and so maybe this loss, and maybe being in a final and not quite getting over the line, just helps me to fuel my fire a bit more that I need to keep on pushing, I need to keep on improving.” After missing the first few weeks of the season with injury, Draper has racked up a 19-5 record in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, including his first Masters 1000 title run in Indian Wells. Having also reached ATP Tour finals in Doha and now Madrid, the 23-year-old will on Monday climb one spot to a career-high No. 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings, leapfrogging Novak Djokovic. “I'm really proud of the way I've been the first few months of this season,” reflected Draper in Madrid. “I think the exciting thing is there's so much more to come from myself. I feel like there's still areas of my game that I can really improve, and that's very motivating for me and my coach and my team. “I honestly feel like I'm at the start of my journey, so I'm going to keep on improving and keep on pushing hard and keep these sort-of tough moments in my head to keep on driving myself to be better.” What a tournament for these two 🤩Congratulations on an incredible run @jackdraper0 - you should be so proud 👏@MutuaMadridOpen | #MMOpen pic.twitter.com/2DkefS89fI— ATP Tour (@atptour) May 4, 2025 Ruud entered Sunday’s final chasing his 12th ATP Tour title on clay. In contrast, Draper was contesting his first tour-level final on the surface. Despite that disparity in clay-court experience, Draper impressed throughout the pair’s maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, with only some minor lapses in his level proving the difference. “I didn't feel like his level really dropped off, apart from maybe a couple of double faults he threw in,” said Draper of Ruud’s 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 triumph. “Whereas [my level at] a couple of stages in the match just dipped a little bit, and that was the difference. You can't do that, especially at this level against that kind of calibre of player, especially on the clay. “I thought there was a lot of good stuff, but just in a couple of key moments, I felt like his level maintained and mine maybe just dipped off a little bit.” Draper will next compete in Rome at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, before bringing his clay season to a close at Roland Garros. His opponents at both events will be wary of a player who is learning quickly on a surface on which he has relatively little experience. “Coming here I felt really good on the court,” explained Draper. “I'm learning how to slide into the ball better. I suppose just very proud of the way my mindset is on the clay. Maybe Andy [Murray] was the same, because he did obviously so well on the clay courts as well, but it's easy from someone from, say, the U.K. who doesn't play much on the surface to think, ‘Oh, I'm not great on this. I'm not going to be any good’. “I know that it's going to be a challenge for me, but I'm going to give it my best effort to do well on it and find ways to be effective. I'm proud of the way I've approached that, and I think with that mindset, you can go a long way. I'm very proud of that and breaking new ground.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
