It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "The Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell is much more than a tennis event. It is also a meeting point for the city’s sports stars, who are all keen to visit the ATP 500 clay-court tournament and enjoy the show. For example, this week stars of FC Barcelona and the Spanish national team Ferran Torres, Dani Olmo and Eric Garcia were seen on the Rafa Nadal Centre Court. The three footballers watched Carlos Alcaraz’s victory over Laslo Djere on Wednesday. Ferran Torres also met the man who has won the Conde de Godo trophy twice (2022-23) at the famous swimming pool at Real Club de Tenis Barcelona-1899, where the champion traditionally celebrates his win by jumping into the water. As the two athletes exchanged a few words, Alcaraz feigned pushing the Barça striker in the pool and the footballer replied: “On Sunday, on Sunday!” in reference to the traditional champion’s dip in Barcelona.         View this post on Instagram                       A post shared by Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell (@bcnopenbs) One day later, on Thursday, it was Danish defender Andreas Christensen’s turn to make an appearance at the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell and cheer on his countryman Holger Rune. The No. 13 in the PIF ATP Rankings defeated defending champion Casper Ruud, ending his run of seven consecutive wins at the tournament. After the match, Christensen and Rune greeted one another and immortalised the moment with a selfie. They were also joined by Karen Khachanov, this year’s first semi-finalist in Barcelona having defeated Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Carlos Alcaraz kept alive his electric run of form on Friday at the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell, where he extended his win streak to eight matches. The top seed earned an impressive 7-5, 6-3 victory over Alex de Minaur to reach the semi-finals at the ATP 500. Alcaraz, who lifted his second ATP Tour title of the season in Monte-Carlo on Sunday, was twice forced to rally in the opening set, but timed his charge to perfection to seal a one-hour, 39-minute victory. “I started quite badly with the serve, I was struggling a little bit mentally with [it],” said Alcaraz, who won 57 per cent (12/21) of first-serve points in the opening set, according to Infosys ATP Stats. “It was just the first few games with my serve, then I think I improved a lot. I calmed myself down and started to think positively again. Alex started strong, playing aggressively, and the first set was really tight.” Hunt for the hat-trick gains pace 💪 2022-23 champion @carlosalcaraz storms into the semi-finals 7-5 6-3 past de Minaur@bcnopenbs | #BCNOpenBS pic.twitter.com/WrwT0kdYR8 — ATP Tour (@atptour) April 18, 2025 Alcaraz is now among a group of six players to record eight consecutive tour-level wins in 2025. The Spaniard, who won back-to-back titles in Barcelona in 2022-23, will face Arthur Fils in the semi-finals. The seventh-seeded Fils advanced to his first semi-final of the season after Stefanos Tsitsipas retired in the third game of their quarter-final clash. Longest Winning Streaks on 2025 ATP Tour  Player  Wins  Sebastian Baez  8  Jiri Lehecka  8  Gael Monfils  8  Denis Shapovalov  8  Alexander Zverev  8  Carlos Alcaraz  8 In the other half of the draw, sixth seed Holger Rune delivered a statement 6-4, 6-2 victory over defending champion Casper Ruud. Although the 21-year-old Dane commanded from the baseline, he displayed the tactical nous to move forward when required, highlighted by a clever serve-and-volley play en route to holding serve for 2-0 in the second set. By notching his third consecutive Top-10 win (also Tsitsipas, Medvedev en route to Indian Wells final), Rune extended his quarter-final winning streak to six matches, which dates back to Cincinnati last year. “It means a lot, it was a really good match today,” said Rune, who improved to 14-9 in 2025. “I was hitting through my groundstrokes and feeling good. I played the right way and I’m very happy I was able to finish it. He made it difficult, he’s a great player. I think I played on my terms and I was really explosive, this is how I want to play.” Former World No. 4 Rune, who is up to No. 11 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, could return to the Top 10 for the first time since last April if he reaches the final in Barcelona. While Ruud took a 6-1 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead into Friday’s clash with Rune, he was unable to find his range, hitting 29 unforced errors during the 87-minute contest. Ruud will leave Barcelona having dropped five spots to No. 15 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. Into his 23rd ATP Tour semi-final (10-12), Rune will face Karen Khachanov, who earlier moved past the in-form Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-4, 7-5 in one hour, 45 minutes. The 28-year-old Khachanov, who is into his third clay-court semi-final, reeled off five consecutive games from 2-5 and saved a set point in the second set. “I’ve been playing really well. I’ve finally found a rhythm of playing consecutive matches and winning close ones, which gives me confidence,” said Khachanov. “Alejandro is playing tremendously well this year, and I had to dig deep to win this one, especially in the second set.” Having reached two ATP Tour finals in Delray Beach and Acapulco, and the semi-finals at the Masters 1000 in Monte-Carlo last week, Davidovich Fokina is ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin.
