It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Letâ€™s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "ATPTour.com highlights five players from the ATP Challenger Tour to watch during the Australian Open. Record-breaker Fearnley The 23-year-old Jacob Fearnley has enjoyed one of the fastest ascents to the Top 100 in recent memory. Last January, the Briton was No. 646 in the PIF ATP Rankings and had competed in just one Challenger-level event (in 2022). Fearnley helped Texas Christian University claim the 2024 NCAA team title in May before making a splash at the pro level. Fearnley lifted the trophy at his first four of five Challenger events last year, helping him eventually hit a career-high No. 86 this month. Fearnley became just the third player to finish a Challenger season with a win percentage of 90 per cent or greater (min. 25 matches played). He also made the biggest jump to the year-end Top 100 since Jannik Sinner in 2019.The four-time ITA All-American, who took a set off Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon, faces home favourite Nick Kyrgios in the first round. [Read our Fearnley feature from October, when the Briton discussed his dominant Challenger season and playing Djokovic].A dream come true for Jacob Fearnley ðŸ’«#ATPChallenger | @the_LTA | @jakefearnley01 pic.twitter.com/8ALxMaYNqEâ€” ATP Challenger Tour (@ATPChallenger) June 16, 2024 #NextGenATP champion Fonseca Joao Fonseca will bring his electric run of form into his first major main-draw appearance. The 18-year-old won the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF without dropping a set. The teenager became the second-youngest titlist in the eventâ€™s history, only behind Sinner, the Australian Open top seed and World No. 1. Fonseca kickstarted his 2025 season by winning his second Challenger title in Canberra. Last August, he became the youngest Brazilian Challenger champion when he triumphed in Lexington, Kentucky. Fonseca raced through Melbourne qualifying, dropping just 12 games across three matches. Jeddah finalist Learner Tien also advanced through qualifying.Fonseca, on the verge of cracking the Top 100, begins his campaign with a showdown against ninth seed Andrey Rublev. [Read 'Fonseca's talent so obvious at 2, even the yoga instructor noticed', which features insight from the teenager's parents]. Fast-rising Landaluce Joining the likes of Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz in the record books is not an easy feat, but that is just what Martin Landaluce did in 2024, when he became the fifth Spaniard since 2000 to win a Challenger title at age 18 or younger. Tommy Robredo and Nicolas Almagro, former Top 10 players in the PIF ATP Rankings, also accomplished the feat. Landaluce, who won his maiden Challenger title in Olbia, Italy in October, finished ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, one spot shy from qualifying for the eight-player Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. Having celebrated his 19th birthday on 8 January â€” the same day he advanced to the final round of qualifying â€” Landaluce will make his major main-draw debut against Aussie wild card James McCabe. [Read 'Advice from Alcaraz \u0026 more, Landaluce living Spanish teenage dream']. Basavareddy plays childhood idol Fresh off a semi-final run at the ATP 250 in Auckland, Nishesh Basavareddy will continue his dream start to the season by facing his childhood idol, record 10-time champion Novak Djokovic.\"I admire a lot of things in his game,\" Basavareddy told ATPTour.com in October when discussing Djokovic. \"I think first, just his mental strength and all the toughness he has in every moment in his career. Also how he has left no stone unturned throughout his career. Heâ€™s worked on his diet, heâ€™s worked on his physical strength, mental toughness. He has no holes.\" The 19-year-old American turned pro in December following a dominant 2024 season on the ATP Challenger Tour. Basavareddy, who spent two years at Stanford University, won two Challenger titles and reached four additional finals at that level last season. He tallied a 41-13 match record, becoming just the third American in Challenger history (since 1978) to earn more than 40 wins in a single season. Tristan Boyer, another former Stanford player who is making his major main-draw debut in Melbourne, also accomplished the feat in 2024.Basavareddy won the Puerto Vallarta Challenger in November to secure a spot in Jeddah.

[ATP APP] Home hope Walton One of 14 Australians in the main draw, World No. 91 Walton will lean on home support when he faces Frenchman Quentin Halys in the first round. The 25-year-old Walton was one of two Australians to claim a pair of Challenger titles last season (Thanasi Kokkinakis). He made four additional finals at that level, tallying a 41-20 Challenger-match record in 2024, which was just his second full season as a professional. The former University of Tennessee standout cracked the Top 100 for the first time after winning the Taipei Challenger last May. Walton earned his first major main-draw win at Wimbledon. Now his sights are set on adding to that count Down Under. [Read about Walton's golfing hobby and the time he nailed a hole-in-one].",

    "description": "From the ski slopes to tennisâ€™ mountaintop, 23-year-old Jannik Sinner has already seen it all. The Italianâ€™s emphatic ascent has been punctuated by milestones that reflect not just his talent but his unyielding determination. While his demeanour on and off the court remains composed and unassuming, Sinnerâ€™s dominance at the top of the ATP Tour tells a different story. Â  Â  Â  Â  View this post on Instagram Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  A post shared by ATP Tour (@atptour) Sinner carved out a stellar 2024 season that has cemented his place as one of the gameâ€™s defining forces. The first Italian No. 1 One of Sinnerâ€™s many landmark moments came in June 2024, when he became the first Italian to reach No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Sinnerâ€™s full-circle moment came in November, when he drew his season to a close by securing his first title on home soil (Nitto ATP Finals) and leading Italy to a successful defence of its Davis Cup title. By breaking new ground for Italian tennis, Sinner has inspired a generation of players from his home country. The year-end No. 1 After falling short to Novak Djokovic in the final of the 2023 Nitto ATP Finals, Sinnerâ€™s return to Turin was made sweeter as he collected his maiden ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours trophy. The Italianâ€™s emphatic 2024 season saw him pull well clear of the chasing pack, with a Tour-leading 73 wins and eight titles, including his first two Grand Slam crowns. The one you canâ€™t ignore Sinnerâ€™s scintillating rise to the top of the tennis world is something that simply cannot go unnoticed. With his blistering baseline play and eerie athleticism, Sinner soared to a 73-6 win-loss record in 2024 (18-5 vs Top 10) according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. The steely nature of his game was further highlighted in his historic run to the Nitto ATP Finals title, where he became the first player to triumph without dropping a set since Ivan Lendl in 1986.
