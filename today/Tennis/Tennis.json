It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/blockx-challenger-2025-feature-february",
    "description": "When Alexander Blockx claimed the 2023 Australian Open boys’ singles title, he defeated talents like Joao Fonseca and Learner Tien along the way. The Belgian escaped Tien in a three-set final, which featured a dramatic super tie-break to decide the match. While Fonseca and Tien have enjoyed their recent moments in the spotlight — contesting in last year’s Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF title match and cracking the Top 100 this season — now the 19-year-old Blockx has his sights set on joining his peers on the ATP Tour and in Jeddah for the 20-and-under showdown. “I think it could be the main goal for this year. I’m very motivated to compete there at the end of the year. I even follow the Race to Jeddah and stuff to see how many points I have,” Blockx told ATPTour.com. “Two years ago, I think it was too early. But last year I was pretty close to qualifying, like 12th or 13th. I was watching and I was like, ‘Okay, this is something I want to do next year!’” Blockx is entering his second season on the ATP Challenger Tour and he has already made a splash on that circuit. He lifted his first Challenger title in November in Kobe, Japan, his penultimate event of the year. After returning home from Asia, Blockx was monitoring a minor elbow injury, opting for rest during his first offseason week. The night before Blockx was set to resume training, he developed a fever that stubbornly lingered for a week, again taking a dent into his scheduled training. “We were like, ‘Okay, something must be wrong!’ I didn’t feel bad, just the fever, a little headache,” Blockx said. “Not even my nose or throat was hurting. Very strange. Then a week later, I felt so bad and all of the sudden, my fever got all the way up to 39 degrees, I couldn’t move anymore. “We were like, ‘This is not normal, we have to see the doctor’. The doctor said in my right lung there was a small inflammation.” Blockx’s illness cut into crucial preseason training time. “I basically didn't move a muscle for three weeks between resting the elbow and then for two weeks I couldn’t move at all. Every time I started moving, my heart rate went up and I started feeling very weak and stuff,” Blockx said. “The first week when I restarted practise, it was all very light. When there was a long rally, I was out of breath and I’d have to wait between the rallies.” After falling short in his first two matches of the season, Blockx played himself into form at last month’s Oeiras, Portugal Challenger, where he returned to the winner’s circle and became the youngest Belgian to earn multiple trophies at that level. Alexander Blockx is crowned champion at the Oeiras Challenger. Credit: Beatriz Ruivo/FPT “Every time you get through these matches, it gives you a boost that you can beat those guys,” Blockx said. “I wasn’t at my best level for the first two matches, but I told myself, ‘It’s a very good thing that I can beat these guys when I’m not playing my very best.’” Born to Ukrainian parents who were both professional athletes, Blockx’s father, Oleg, was a track athlete specialising in hurdle races, while his mother, Natalia, was a swimmer. Despite this diverse sporting background, Blockx has never played any sport besides tennis. Blockx is under the guidance of Philippe Cassiers, who has coached the rising star since the 6’4” Antwerp native was aged four. A highlight of their partnership came in 2023, when Blockx became the junior No. 1 in singles and doubles. Now aiming to establish himself at the highest levels of the sport, Blockx sees the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF as a key stepping stone in his journey. “I think it would be a dream to play there and also to see where you are compared to your other opponents of your age group,” said Blockx, who is fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah.

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/cerundolo-hanfamann-garin-santiago-2025-wednesday",
    "description": "Francisco Cerundolo earned his first match win at the Movistar Chile Open on Wednesday when he clawed past Yannick Hanfmann 6-2, 4-6, 7-6(5) in Santiago. The Argentine lost his previous two matches at the ATP 250 clay-court event but ensured history would not repeat itself for a third time, winning a tight battle against Hanfmann after two hours and 29 minutes. \"I am really happy to get the win,\" Cerundolo said. \"I was feeling really good at the start of the second set, I felt in control of the match and was playing really well. The past two years I came here I didn't play good and today I was feeling good. \"After that he got a break and I think I started feeling a little nervous and was not playing the way I was before. He played much better and after that it was a super tough match.\" Cerundolo, who squandered a break advantage in the third set, now leads Hanfmann 4-1 in the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Having reached the final in Buenos Aires earlier this month, the three-time tour-level titlist will seek another deep run this week in Chile. The top seed will face fifth seed Tomas Martin Etcheverry or Chilean Cristian Garin in the quarter-finals. In other second-round action, Serbian Laslo Djere defeated fourth seed Pedro Martinez 6-1, 6-4 to reach his second tour-level quarter-final of the season. Djere, who advanced to the semis in Buenos Aires earlier this month, also enjoyed runs to the last eight in Santiago in 2021 and 2023. Djere will next meet Portgual’s Jaime Faria. The 21-year-old broke into the Top 100 in the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time on Monday and has backed that up with two good wins in Chile. Faria eliminated Brazilian qualifier Gustavo Heide 6-7(2), 7-6(5), 6-4. Argentine Federico Coria led Chilean wild card Tomas Barrios Vera 6-1 when play was suspended on Tuesday due to a curfew because of widespread power outages across the country. Coria wasted little time reaching the second round on resumption Wednesday, sealing a 6-1, 6-0 victory in 72 minutes. Francisco Comesana held a 7-6(3), 1-2 advantage against Felipe Meligeni Alves when play stopped on Tuesday. He returned to clinch a 7-6(3), 7-6(4) first-round win against the Brazilian qualifier.
