    "description": "The wide slice serve is a CRITICAL tool to have in your tool box. It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Letâ€™s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Holger Rune hit a shot-of-the-tournament contender at a critical moment against Stefanos Tsitsipas on Tuesday at the BNP Paribas Open. Facing break point at 4-3 in the second set, he hit an incredible tweener to help dig out of trouble and eventually seal his 6-4, 6-4 victory. But how did it feel in the moment? \"I think it felt better on the court, actually, but it also looked good on the phone, definitely,\" Rune said. \"I had the expectation that I looked like Roger Federer when I hit it, and I didn't quite do that. So that was disappointing, you know. Definitely felt better.\" ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?! ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©@holgerrune2003 | @BNPPARIBASOPEN | #TennisParadise pic.twitter.com/vRGlOp8bNa â€” ATP Tour (@atptour) March 11, 2025 The Dane was smiling when he made the comment. One of Roger Federer's greatest shots was a tweener against Novak Djokovic at the US Open. The former No. 4 player in the PIF ATP Rankings clearly was simply happy with his performance against the in-form Tsitsipas, who recently won the Dubai title. \"I think a lot of good things today,\" Rune said. \"I think my tweener was not bad.\"Â  Watch the full clip of the hot shot above and decide for yourself!

After rain delayed the start of Day 7 action, Tallon Griekspoor and Yosuke Watanuki did step onto Stadium 2 in the first ATP Tour singles match of the day. However, play was suspended at 1:27 p.m. local time with the Dutchman Griekspoor leading 7-6(4), 4-1. They resumed again at 2:00 p.m and Griekspoor quickly wrapped up a 7-6(4), 6-1 win to reach the quarter-finals at an ATP Masters 1000 for the first time. On Stadium 1, Holger Rune overcame Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets to improve to 4-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The rain began again shortly after the conclusion of Rune's win at 4:05 p.m., when Arthur Fils and Marcos Giron were forced off court at 1-1 in the first set. There will be no play before 5:30 p.m. local time. Later on Tuesday, Daniil Medvedev will play Tommy Paul in the other fourth-round match. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
