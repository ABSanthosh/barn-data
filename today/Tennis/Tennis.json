It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "David Goffin announced his return to clay-court action Tuesday with an impressive opening win against #NextGenATP Martin Landaluce at the EFG Swiss Open Gstaad. The 34-year-old Belgian, who was sidelined through May and June due to a foot injury, prevailed 7-6(2), 6-3 amid windy conditions at the ATP 250 event. After letting slip seven break points in the first set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, Goffin delivered a watertight tie-break and rode his momentum through a two-hour victory. “It feels great to be back 10 years after my final,” said Goffin, who fell to Dominic Thiem in the 2015 final in Gstaad. “I’m very happy to win my first match after injury on a nice centre court with super nice landscape, it’s the best place to come back and win.” Landaluce was competing in Gstaad through the Next Gen Accelerator, which offers players aged 20 and under increased opportunity to compete on the ATP Tour. The 19-year-old Spaniard, who is the No. 138 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, was aiming for his second tour-level win after winning his first-round match against Jaume Munar at the ATP Masters 1000 in Miami last year. “This programme allows me to escalate in the rankings more easily because I can play tournaments that I wouldn’t be able to without this help,” said Landaluce, who is eighth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah. “I’m very privileged and grateful to have this because this is a nice tournament. I think it’s a nice programme and hopefully it can help other young players.” Martin Landaluce is the No. 138 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. Photo: Breakpoint Images / EFG Swiss Open Gstaad 2025 Goffin will next face Juan Manuel Cerundolo, who earlier defeated last year’s semi-finalist Jan-Lennard Struff 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. The Argentine, who reached the final at the ATP Challenger Tour event in Braunschweig last week, used the high altitude to dictate with his heavy topspin forehand in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Struff. Other winners on Tuesday included seventh seed Francisco Comesana and qualifier Francesco Passaro. Comesana defeated Marco Trungelliti 6-3, 6-4, while Passaro upset eighth seed Arthur Rinderknech 6-1, 7-5. Spaniard Roberto Carballes Baena beat countryman Carlos Taberner 1-6, 6-2, 7-6(5) and Swiss wild card Jerome Kym earned his first tour-level win with a 7-5, 4-6, 7-5 triumph against Calvin Hemery. Alexander Shevchenko overcame former World No. 3 Stan Wawrinka 6-3, 6-2 to reach the second round. Wawrinka reached the final at the ATP 250 event in 2005.Watch Tuesday Highlights from Gstaad: [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "#NextGenATP Norwegian Nicolai Budkov Kjaer captured his first ATP Tour win on Tuesday at the Nordea Open in Bastad, where he earned a 5-7, 6-3, 7-6(2) comeback victory against Brazilian Thiago Monteiro. The 18-year-old, who came through qualifying at the ATP 250 clay-court event, has climbed four spots to ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah and will next play fourth seed Sebastian Baez in Sweden. Budkov Kjaer is looking to qualify for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF for the first time and has tasted success in the past year. Twelve months ago, the Norwegian lifted the Wimbledon boys’ singles trophy and then cracked the winner's code on the ATP Challenger Tour for the first time in February when he triumphed in Glasgow, Scotland. The 18-year-old was competing in just his fifth event at that level and became the second-youngest Norwegian to win an ATP Challenger Tour title. The only player to do so at a younger age is Casper Ruud, who sent a message of support to his countryman and Davis Cup teammate following his triumph. In other action on Day 2 in Bastad, Swedish wild card Elias Ymer defeated American Tristan Boyer 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 to earn his first ATP Tour win since Stockholm in 2023. Seventh seed Damir Dzumhur moved past Sebastian Ofner 6-4, 6-4 to set a Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting against Hugo Gaston. The Frenchman Gaston downed Chun-Hsin Tseng 6-4, 6-3, breaking the 23-year-old’s serve four times, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Italian qualifier Andrea Pellegrino also advanced, overcoming Portugal’s Jaime Faria 2-6, 6-3, 6-3. He will next play second seed Tallon Griekspoor. Botic van de Zandschulp led Mikael Ymer 5-4 in the first set when played was suspended for the day due to rain. Cristian Garin and Camilo Ugo Carabelli will also resume on Wednesday with the Chilean ahead 3-2 in the first set. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
