    "description": "World No.4 Coco Gauff will make her United Cup debut for Team USA alongside world No.7 and US Open finalist Taylor Fritz at the innovative mixed team event in 2025. Twenty-year-old Gauff, who was the flag bearer for the United States at the Olympic Games in Paris, thrives in a team environment. “This will be my first time playing the United Cup so I’m super excited to kick off the year in Australia,” Gauff said. “It’s always an honour to represent my country.” “It’s a really, cool event. I had a lot of fun playing mixed doubles at the Olympics so I kinda want to do that again. “I’ve never been to other parts of Australia, other than Melbourne. I don’t know what city we’re going to play in yet but I’m super excited to go whether it’s Perth or Sydney.” [ATP APP] World No.3 Alexander Zverev, who helped guide Team Germany to a memorable comeback win over Poland to secure the second edition of the United Cup, used the event to set up a stellar season, including deep runs at the Grand Slams and the Roland Garros final. The 27-year-old, who holds 22 ATP singles titles, is looking forward to making his third appearance at the tournament. “It’s the first week of the year… and we all want to be in Australia and play against the best players in the world and that’s what the United Cup brings,” Zverev said. “Playing for your nation is obviously extremely special and I have the best memories from this year.” The unique team environment United Cup offers is also a big motivation for Leylah Fernandez and Felix Auger-Aliassime who are set to line up for Team Canada again in 2025. “I want to play United Cup 2025 because it’s such a fun team experience,” said Fernandez, a US Open finalist in 2021. “I love being part of a team... I get to see a little bit more of the men’s side of the team and also how they think on court, I get to pick their brains a little bit. “I also think the interaction between all of us [is special], we grew up together so it’s good to have that moment to catch up.” We're baaaaack! Did you miss us? Cos we missed you 😉 #UnitedCup 🏆 Dec 27 - Jan 5 2025 in Sydney and Perth @sydney_sider #feelnewsydney @WestAustralia #WAtheDreamState pic.twitter.com/tG6IbD705D — United Cup (@UnitedCupTennis) August 26, 2024 Auger-Aliassime agrees, “It’s a great way to start the year,” he said. “I’ve had great success [playing for my country] and mixing up with Leylah, is always good.

    "description": "Rafael Nadal announced his upcoming retirement Thursday, stating that next month’s Davis Cup Finals will be his final event. “Hello everyone, I am here to let you know I am retiring from professional tennis,” said Nadal in Spanish in a video posted on social media. “The reality is it has been some difficult years, these last two especially. I don’t think I have been able to play without limitations. “It is obviously a difficult decision, one that has taken me some time to make, but in this life, everything has a beginning and an end, and I think it’s the appropriate time to put an end to a career that has been long and much more successful than I could have ever imagined.” [ATP APP] The Spanish icon held World No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings for 209 weeks, sixth-most since the rankings’ inception in 1973. Nadal earned ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours five times. ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi said: “Rafa’s impact on tennis is immeasurable. For over two decades, he brought unmatched tenacity and grit to every match. His fierce competitive spirit and iconic rivalries during one of the sport’s greatest eras captivated fans around the world. He elevated the game and inspired millions to pick up a racquet. “Rafa’s achievements are nothing short of historic — he won it all. His record at Roland-Garros, in particular, will likely never be eclipsed. But what stands out most is his character. Humble, authentic, and always gracious, he earned the deep respect of players, fans, and everyone involved in tennis. His multiple sportsmanship awards reflect the class he has shown throughout his career, on and off the court. Gracias Rafa, #RafaSiempre ❤️ pic.twitter.com/m7NXorFaNx— ATP Tour (@atptour) October 10, 2024 Nadal was a member of the ATP Player Advisory Council from 2010-12 and 2019-22. The Spaniard has impacted countless lives through his Rafa Nadal Foundation, which received the Laureus Sport For Good Award this year. Gaudenzi added: “Rafa’s contributions extended beyond the court as well. His work on the ATP Player Advisory Council for many years has helped serve the sport and its future. As we look forward to his farewell at the Davis Cup, we know his legacy will live on for generations. Rafa, thank you for everything — you will be greatly missed on Tour.” The 38-year-old was the first men’s player in history to complete the career Grand Slam twice and won 22 major championships overall, only trailing Novak Djokovic (24). The Spaniard earned two Australian Open crowns, 14 Roland-Garros trophies, two Wimbledon titles and four US Open victories. His 14 Coupe des Mousquetaires alone give him more major titles than all but three other men (Djokovic, Roger Federer and Pete Sampras) in history. The Spaniard tallied a 112-4 record at the clay-court major, one of the most dominant efforts in all of sport. Nadal owns many records, including most clay-court titles in the Open Era (63). He captured an ATP Tour title in 19 consecutive seasons from 2004-22 and maintained a Top 10 PIF ATP Ranking for 912 straight weeks from 25 April 2005 through 19 March 2023. The 92-time titlist has earned 1,080 tour-level wins during his illustrious career, the fourth-most victories on record behind only Jimmy Connors (1,274), Roger Federer (1,251) and Djokovic (1,122). The Mallorcan qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals 17 times, earning his place at the season finale every year from 2005 through 2020, as well as in 2022. The lefty excelled at ATP Masters 1000 events, claiming 36 titles at the elite level. His 410 Masters 1000 wins are the most in the series’ history (since 1990). Nadal is the winner of 15 ATP Tour Awards: ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF (2008, ‘10, ‘13, ‘17, ‘19), the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award (2011), Comeback Player of the Year (2013), the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship (2010, ‘18-21), Most Improved Player of the Year (2005), Newcomer of the Year (2003) and Fans' Favourite (2022). He is also a two-time Laureus World Sportsman of the Year (2011 and 2021). The lefty claimed Laureus’ World Breakthrough of the Year in 2006 and Comeback of the Year in 2014. He won two Olympic gold medals, earning singles glory in Beijing in 2008 and doubles gold in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 with Marc Lopez. The Spaniard climbed to the top of the sport for the first time aged 22, reaching World No. 1 on 18 August 2008. He once held top spot for 56 consecutive weeks (7 June 2010-3 July 2011) and was most recently World No. 1 in February 2020. “Really, everything I have experienced has been a dream come true,” Nadal said. “I leave with the absolute peace of mind of having given my best, of having made an effort in every way. I can only end by saying a thousand thanks to all and see you soon.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal have battled fiercely on the tennis court for nearly two decades, yet their rivalry transcends mere competition. There is a deep mutual respect between the two legends, a sentiment Djokovic captured perfectly in a social media tribute to Nadal, who on Thursday announced that he will retire in November. “One post is not enough to express the respect I have for you and what you have done for our sport,” Djokovic wrote. “You have inspired millions of children to start playing tennis and I think that’s probably the greatest achievement anyone can wish for. Your tenacity, dedication, fighting spirit is going to be taught for decades.” Rafa, one post is not enough to express the respect I have for you and what you have done for our sport. You have inspired millions of children to start playing tennis and I think that’s probably greatest achievement anyone can wish for. Your tenacity, dedication, fighting spirit… pic.twitter.com/HO9kUkyccN — Novak Djokovic (@DjokerNole) October 10, 2024 Both former No. 1s in the PIF ATP Rankings, Djokovic and Nadal have contested countless epic showdowns, often lasting hours and testing the physical limits and mental endurance of both players. Djokovic and Nadal have met a record 60 times, with the Serbian holding a 31-29 lead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. It is one of the greatest rivalries not only in tennis, but in sports. “Your legacy will live forever,” Djokovic added. “Only you know what you had to endure to become an icon of tennis and sport in general. Thank you for pushing me to the very limit so many times in our rivalry that has impacted me the most as a player.” The 38-year-old Nadal will compete in his final professional event at the Davis Cup Finals, to be held in Malaga, Spain from 19-24 November. “Your passion for representing Spain has always been remarkable,” Djokovic said. “I wish you the best possible farewell in Malaga with the Davis Cup team of Spain. I will be there in person to pay respect to your stellar career.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Carlos Alcaraz admits to have had no response to the blistering tennis thrown at him Thursday by Tomas Machac, who upset the World No. 2 in the quarter-finals of the Rolex Shanghai Masters. Alcaraz's 12-match winning streak came to an abrupt end in a 7-6(5), 7-5 defeat at the hands of Machac, who claimed his second win over a Top-5 player (Djokovic, Geneva SF). It was a winning streak that included the pair's maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash at the Davis Cup last month, in which Machac was forced to retire at one set apiece. As he did when representing Czechia, Machac took the opening set in a tie-break in Shanghai, but the 23-year-old made no mistake of closing it out in straight sets, exuding extreme confidence throughout. Czech this out! 🤯 Machac downs Alcaraz to reach the semi-finals in Shanghai, where he will face Sinner!@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/kabm9UMx6U — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 10, 2024 “I felt like I was playing against a Top-5 player,” said Alcaraz, who suffered his first defeat since his second-round exit at the US Open. “Not even Top 10, no, Top 5. His level was so high. I thought that he was going to give me an opportunity, a window, but he didn't. “From the first game until the last one, his level was so high. His ball speed, it was unbelievable. Honestly, I felt good on the court, I felt the ball really well, I was hitting well, I was moving well. But, at some points, I didn't know what to do.” Alcaraz showed signs of a second-set fightback after he had retrieved the break back, but Machac kept his foot on the gas to dismantle the Spaniard’s serve for a second time before serving out the victory with ease. “It was unbelievable, it was crazy for me,” added Alcaraz. “He was pushing me to the limit all the time that I was thinking that I had to put the right ball in the right place all the time. If not, I was going to run everywhere, or he was going to make a winner. So I think that the pressure he put [on] me was the key in the match.” Alcaraz, who has qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin, is next scheduled to play the Rolex Paris Masters after slipping to 51-10 on the season.

The 23-year-old stunned Carlos Alcaraz 7-6(5), 7-5, and snapped the Spaniard's 12-match winning streak Thursday evening at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. Playing his third tour-level quarter-final, he admitted it was not easy against “one of the best” players on Tour. The Czech is happy with the performance it took to claim the biggest win of his career against the No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings. “Well, I was playing this kind of tennis even with Tommy Paul, [in the] second set and the third set, so I was playing unbelievable even there. So, I was just trying to continue in this way, and it happened from the beginning of the match, so that was the key,\" he shared. \"I know that against Alcaraz I have to play this level to have a chance to win, so I just tried to slow the ball [a little bit]… I managed to make it until the end, so I'm really happy with that.\" Even though he failed to win against Alcaraz at the Davis Cup last month after being forced to retire during the match, Machac shook the disappointment and delivered a strong performance today. Nerves did not prove a roadblock for him. “I was looking for the revenge, for sure,” he said. “I tried to learn from the match against him at the Davis Cup, I was playing [at a] great level also there, but I just tried to do something different, and it happened, and I'm really happy with that. What I did? I was just trying to play this level, and take a little bit more time and try to not think about anything. And the body was playing on my behalf, so I just tried to be in the zone as long as possible.\" [ATP APP] He was also full of praise for the Shanghai atmosphere and good friend Zhang Zhizhen with whom he competed in doubles. “I really enjoy [being] here, and I really enjoy to play doubles with Zhang Zhizhen. It was great atmosphere on the court when we play doubles, and I hear some fans [cheering] for him, even in the singles, so I'm really enjoying that, and I'm really happy that I can be partners with him. So, happy with the crowd, too, to cheer for me here.” Yes, not Alcaraz's best, but it was another great day for Machac on the forehand 💪 The Machac Fh has been on 🔥 this week 📈 Check out his average speed and landing location 👇#TennisInsights | @atptour | @RolexSHMasters pic.twitter.com/YPnjebPhCA — Tennis Insights (@tennis_insights) October 10, 2024 The Czech will face top seed Jannik Sinner in the semi-final, who ousted Daniil Medvedev 6-1, 6-4 in their quarter-final match.

It's the best tennis what I saw today, for sure. With Medvedev, he was playing unbelievable. But I'm really looking forward to the challenge, so I will enjoy it.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-alcaraz-nadal-2024-retirement-reaction",
    "description": "Rafael Nadal has been a role model, an idol and, at times, a rival for Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. Never mind all of the accolades Nadal has accomplished in his storied 23-year professional career, Sinner believes the Spaniard’s legacy will stretch beyond lifting — or biting — trophies. “Of course, we all saw how good he has been as a player and the lessons he taught us, the young players, how to behave on the court, how to handle situations on the court, tough situations,” Sinner, No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, said following his quarter-final victory at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. “He gave all of us a lot of emotions when we saw him playing. And also to stay humble, in the same time, not changing with the success, choosing the right people around him, having a great family. There are so many great things he gave to all of us.”[ATP APP] For Nadal’s countryman Alcaraz, 17 years his junior, the 92-time tour-level titlist has long been a source of inspiration. “He has been my idol since I started playing tennis. I look up to him. Proudly, thanks to him, I really wanted to become professional,” Alcaraz said. “Losing him, in a certain way, is going to be difficult for us, so I will try to enjoy as much as I can when he's going to play.” Alcaraz’s childhood idol has turned into a friend. He has enjoyed sharing the court with Nadal, most recently at the Paris Olympics, where they partnered in doubles and reached the quarter-finals. They will both be in Spanish red when the 38-year-old competes in his final professional event at the Davis Cup Finals, to be held in Malaga from 19-24 November. “From the child who watched you on television and dreamed of becoming a tennis player to the one who had the immense gift of playing alongside you at Roland Garros, representing Spain in the Olympic Games! Thank you very much for being an example at all levels, your legacy is unrepeatable,” Alcaraz wrote in Spanish on X. “I have enjoyed you very much and I will miss you very much when you leave after the Davis Cup, Rafa!”Del niño que te veía por televisión y soñaba con llegar a ser tenista al que tuvo el inmenso regalo de jugar a tu lado en Roland Garros representando a España en unos Juegos Olímpicos! 🥲 Muchas gracias por ser ejemplo a todos los niveles, tu legado es irrepetible! ❤️ Te he… pic.twitter.com/MiX8l5Jnrh— Carlos Alcaraz (@carlosalcaraz) October 10, 2024 Nadal, who has spent 209 weeks at No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, thrice played Alcaraz in tour-level matches, the same amount of times he faced Sinner. The lefty leads Alcaraz 2-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series and is 3-0 against the Italian. “I was very lucky to get to know him and he's an unbelievable person,” Sinner said. “It's a tough notification [to learn of his retirement], but in another way, everything has a beginning, it has a start, and also an ending.” Now with Sinner and Alcaraz building a thrilling rivalry and fighting for the sport’s biggest trophies, like this year, when they split the season’s four majors, fans are eager to draw comparisons between the two young superstars and legends such as the ‘Big Three’, Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer. “They have been very consistent throughout the years. There's not only been one season or two seasons, they made it for 15 years,” Sinner said. “It's amazing what they have achieved, what they have done. There are a lot of things that we can take from them. We cannot compare ourselves with them, that's impossible, especially in this moment now. I think we all were very lucky to see the Big Three playing tennis. And I consider myself very lucky to get to know them also as a person and to learn from them.”Thank you @RafaelNadal for everything you have given to the sport. To have the chance to spend a few weeks training with you a few years ago is something I’ll never forget. To watch you work as an athlete but also get to know you as a person off the court was even more special.… pic.twitter.com/Obyrk5V5mh— Jannik Sinner (@janniksin) October 10, 2024 [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

Competing in his third tour-level quarter-final, the No. 33 in the PIF ATP Rankings ignited some of his most blistering tennis to neutralise the threat of the World No. 2, prevailing 7-6(5), 7-5. In a match in which both players produced high-quality tennis, Machac found another gear to record his second win over a Top-5 opponent (Djokovic, Geneva SF). “I knew that the level of my tennis would be great because I am playing the best right now, for sure,” said Machac. “I beat Tommy Paul [in my] last match with an unbelievable performance. With these types of players, I have to play this level otherwise it’s 6-2, 6-3 [and] you go home, there is no other option. I am happy I managed to play like this for two sets. “I knew that I had a chance [to beat Alcaraz], but you never know, even with a set and 5-4 [lead] it’s still so far from winning the match. I played great tennis against him in the Davis Cup [in September], but there was this level [for] only one set. Today it was [for] two, so it was enough.” Czech this out! 🤯 Machac downs Alcaraz to reach the semi-finals in Shanghai, where he will face Sinner!@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/kabm9UMx6U — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 10, 2024 Machac led by a set in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Alcaraz at the Davis Cup last month, but was forced to retire once the Spaniard had levelled the match. The 23-year-old made no mistake this time, however, striking 20 winners in a statement opening set before dismantling Alcaraz's serve in the third game of the second. Alcaraz showed signs of a fightback after he had retrieved the break, but the Czech maintained his composure to seal victory in one hour and 54 minutes, winning 100 per cent (7/7) of points at the net in the second set, according to Infosys ATP Stats. [ATP APP] Machac, who opted to play an ATP Challenger Tour event instead of the Rolex Shanghai Masters last year, is now up to No. 25 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. He will face World No. 1 Jannik Sinner for a spot in the final after the Italian eased past Daniil Medvedev to reach his first Shanghai semi-final. After becoming the fourth lowest-ranked semi-finalist in Shanghai tournament history, Machac will bid to level his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Sinner after falling to a 6-4, 6-2 defeat in the quarter-finals of the ATP Masters 1000 in Miami. “I am looking forward to it,” Machac said of his upcoming clash with Sinner. “I am really enjoying it and am happy that I can play against the best [players].\" [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

Stars from tennis and beyond quickly took to social media to congratulate the Spaniard on his unforgettable career. Roger Federer, who played his final match alongside Nadal at the 2022 Laver Cup, led the way with a message. “What a career, Rafa! I always hoped this day would never come,” Federer wrote in an Instagram comment. “Thank you for the unforgettable memories and all your incredible achievements in the game we love. It’s been an absolute honour!” Thank you for everything Rafa, it’s been nothing short of incredible ♥️#RafaSiempre pic.twitter.com/CcussCL5LZ — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 10, 2024 Casper Ruud, who played doubles with the Spaniard in Bastad earlier this year, wrote: “RAFA Forever!!” Ruud wrote. “Thank you for everything legend.” Andy Roddick and Rod Laver were among the other stars who shared their thoughts on the lefty’s announcement.

    "description": "Rafael Nadal has announced he will retire at the end of the 2024 season. The 38-year-old Spaniard will compete in his final professional event at the Davis Cup Finals, to be held in Malaga from 19-24 November. “Hello everyone, I am here to let you know I am retiring from professional tennis,” said Nadal in Spanish in a video posted on X. “The reality is it has been some difficult years, these last two especially. I don’t think I have been able to play without limitations. “It is obviously a difficult decision, one that has taken me some time to make, but in this life, everything has a beginning and an end, and I think it’s the appropriate time to put an end to a career that has been long and much more successful than I could have ever imagined.” A 92-time tour-level champion who spent 209 weeks at No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Nadal has been one of the leading lights on the ATP Tour since turning pro in 2001. He is a 22-time Grand Slam titlist, a tally which includes a record 14 crowns at Roland Garros. Thank you for everything Rafa, it’s been nothing short of incredible ♥️#RafaSiempre pic.twitter.com/CcussCL5LZ — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 10, 2024 Nadal will bring his storied career to a close on home soil in Malaga, where he will be part of a Spain Davis Cup team that also includes Carlos Alcaraz. The host nation plays its quarter-final tie against the Netherlands on Tuesday, 19 November from 5 p.m. local time (CET). “I am very excited that my last tournament will be the final of the Davis Cup and representing my country,\" said Nadal. \"I think I’ve come full circle since one of my first great joys as a professional tennis player was the Davis Cup final in Sevilla in 2004. “I feel super, super lucky for all the things I’ve been able to experience.” Nadal, who has a 12-7 record for 2024 so far, went on to thank his ATP Tour rivals, his team, and his family (including his uncle and former coach Toni Nadal). Despite his body rarely allowing him to compete at full fitness across the past two seasons, the Spaniard’s trademark dedication to his sport never faltered. He attributed part of his desire to continue playing this long to the arrival of his son, Rafael, whom he shares with his wife Maria. “To come home and see how my son is growing every day has been a force that has really kept me alive and with the necessary energy to continue,” said the Spaniard. [ATP APP] Nadal is hugely popular with fans around the world. His heavy-hitting lefty game, combined with his almost unrivalled desire to compete and his role as part of the ‘Big Three’ alongside Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, mean he will end his career as one of tennis’ biggest icons. “Finally, you, the fans. I can’t thank you enough for what you have made me feel,” said Nadal at the end of the video. “You have given me the energy I have needed at every moment. “Really, everything I have experienced has been a dream come true. I leave with the absolute peace of mind of having given my best, of having made an effort in every way. I can only end by saying a thousand thanks to all and see you soon.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Jannik Sinner continued his momentum in his Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry against Daniil Medvedev on Thursday with a stylish quarter-final victory at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. The No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings eased to a 6-1, 6-4 victory against the fifth-seeded Medvedev to reach his fifth ATP Masters 1000 semi-final of the season. Sinner made a red-hot start inside Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena and barely looked back to overwhelm Medvedev, who received treatment on his shoulder from the physio midway through the second set. “Obviously I’m very happy how I handled today and this match,” said Sinner. “It felt like he had a bit of shoulder pain and couldn’t hit his forehand as well as he wished to. Hopefully he can recover as fast as possible, but from my side it was a great match, a great battle, and let’s see what I can do now in the semi-finals.” Sinner lost his first six tour-level meetings against Medvedev up until the 2023 Miami final. Since then, the Italian has prevailed in seven of the pair’s eight encounters to level their Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 7-7. His latest victory was earned with a confident, clean-hitting display in which he faced just one break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Into the semi-finals 🔥@janniksin takes out Medvedev 6-1 6-4 to reach his 10th career ATP Masters 1000 SF in Shanghai 💪@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/1oAqBI6TLA— ATP Tour (@atptour) October 10, 2024 Although Medvedev struggled physically at times, he was given hardly any chance to work his way into the match by Sinner, who powered to the first set after dropping just three points on serve. The second set was more of a contest, but the Italian broke serve decisively in the fifth game en route to an 85-minute triumph. “It’s better [than my career expectations],” said Sinner, when asked about reaching his 10th Masters 1000 semi-final. “You cannot plan when you are young. You never know what is going to happen in your career. You just try to improve daily. “Obviously I’m very happy to be in this position. Being in the semi-finals of a Masters is always a big step forward. It’s a huge accomplishment from my side, but we try to keep going, we try to improve and see what I can do. But talking about today, it was a great match, and I’m looking forward to the semis.” More top 🎾 from @janniksin 👏Less than 1% of matches on the @atptour finish with all 4 #ShotQuality scores greater than 🎱#TennisInsights | @atptour | @RolexSHMasters pic.twitter.com/yr791wrAEF— Tennis Insights (@tennis_insights) October 10, 2024 Now into the semi-finals in Shanghai for the first time, Sinner will take on third seed Carlos Alcaraz or Tomas Machac for a spot in the championship match. If his next opponent is Alcaraz, whose coach Juan Carlos Ferrero was in the stands to watch Sinner beat Medvedev, it will be a rematch of the thrilling China Open final from just eight days ago, when the Spaniard edged Sinner in a deciding-set tie-break. By downing Medvedev for his 63rd tour-level victory of the season, Sinner also took another step towards securing ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours. The 23-year-old now leads second-placed Alcaraz by 3,020 points in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, although the Spaniard can reduce that gap by 200 points by defeating Machac later on Thursday.

It’s magnificent, we have the chance being French to be able to stop in these kind of incredible places. An end, it’s always complicated, all the former great players always told me it’s not easy to announce. You never know when, how, where.

Goffin produced a vintage performance on Wednesday to upset second seed Alexander Zverev, prevailing 6-4, 7-5 to reach the quarter-finals of an ATP Masters 1000 for the first time since 2021.

Even if she doesn’t realise yet, hopefully she will come and watch a little bit. “Sometimes you have doubts about your fitness and your head. If you're not 100 per cent there, mentally, it’s tough to compete with those guys - the level is so high. I have put a lot of hard work in [over] the past few months and there is no [surprise] the tennis came back and I am really happy to be back again in the quarter-finals of an ATP Masters 1000.” [ATP APP] Goffin, who was hampered by injuries following the 2021 US Open, has shown glimpses of his best tennis over the past few months. After making the semi-finals at the Winston-Salem Open, Goffin produced a strong run to the third round at Flushing Meadows. This week in Shanghai, Goffin ousted 15th seed Lorenzo Musetti in a thrilling battle before denying Zverev in his quest for a second title in 2024. “I have built confidence from the beginning of the tournament. Match after match, I was playing better and I just came on the court and tried to play my best tennis,” added Goffin. “[I tried] to stick to the plan that I had with my coach and it worked. Even though he came back with some good rallies, I just tried to stay positive because I was on the right way to winning the match. It paid off in the end with a really good service game to finish, so I am really happy with the win.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

For the players, it will offer them the same conditions they have played under at a number of other events on tour.” The grass-court major also announced a provisional schedule for the final weekend. The men’s doubles finals will commence at 1 p.m. Saturday, followed by the women’s singles final at 4 p.m. On Sunday, the men’s singles final will take place at 4 p.m., an hour later than previous years' championship matches.

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/djokovic-shanghai-2024-wednesday",
    "description": "Novak Djokovic finished with a flourish against Roman Safiullin on Wednesday to reach the quarter-finals of the Rolex Shanghai Masters for a 10th time. The record four-time champion was forced to dig deep in a 6-3, 6-2 win, remaining firmly alive in his quest for a 100th tour-level title. If Djokovic lifts the trophy in Shanghai, he would become the third man to achieve this feat in the Open Era (Connors, Federer). “Both last night's match and tonight have been, maybe, some of the best matches I have played in a while, so I am just enjoying myself on the court,” said Djokovic, who improved to 35-8 on the season. “When you play well and feel good, there is obviously a lot of joy in striking a tennis ball on the court. “These sensations I have on the tennis court are some of the reasons why I keep on playing and keep on competing because I really believe that I can play at a very high level. Now, it’s a matter of keeping that consistency and also having a good time off the court.” Novak 🫶 Shanghai@DjokerNole defeats Safiullin 6-3 6-2 to reach his 10th #RolexShanghaiMasters quarter-final.@SH_RolexMasters pic.twitter.com/jwkzo8QE9A — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 9, 2024 Djokovic, who improved to 3-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, showed resilience to save 100 per cent (3/3) of the break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. After extending his lead in tournament wins (37), Djokovic will face #NextGenATP star Jakub Mensik, who held his nerve to defeat Grigor Dimitrov 6-3, 3-6, 6-4. The 19-year-old Czech, who clinched his fourth consecutive win against a Top 10 player, is the youngest quarter-finalist in Shanghai tournament history. Safiullin withstood an electric start from Djokovic, landing an inside-out forehand winner crisp on the line to save break point in the second game. However, he was unable to replicate this form to convert the two break chances he had in the fifth game, with the Serb serving his way out of trouble with ease. [ATP APP] Djokovic, who has won a record 40 ATP Masters 1000 titles, remained in control to capitalise on an error-strewn eighth game from Safiullin and storm into the lead. The second set was more straightforward for Djokovic as he proved clinical to break twice and cruise across the finish line. Since his gruelling opener with #NextGenATP Alex Michelsen, which ended 7-6(3), 7-6(9), Djokovic has spent just two hours and 16 minutes on court. This is in stark contrast to Mensik, who has played four consecutive three-set matches to reach this stage. Djokovic is currently eighth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. A strong run in Shanghai will bolster his chances of securing a spot at the Nitto ATP Finals in a bid to extend his record of seven titles. Following Djokovic and Safiullin's clash on centre court, David Goffin delivered a vintage performance to upset second seed Alexander Zverev. The Belgian former No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings held on to claim a 6-4, 7-5 win against the German in one hour and 57 minutes. It is the first time Goffin has reached this stage of an ATP Masters 1000 since the 2021 Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters. The 33-year-old will face seventh seed Taylor Fritz for a spot in the final four in Shanghai. Fritz cruised past Holger Rune 6-1, 6-2 in just 55 minutes to secure his spot in the last eight, edging 2-1 in front in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The American, who occupies fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, is now 785 points ahead of ninth-placed Alex de Minaur and in strong contention to secure his spot at the Nitto ATP Finals.

    "description": "Carlos Alcaraz kept his winning streak alive on Wednesday as he earned a 12th consecutive victory to advance to the quarter-finals at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. Alcaraz was forced to battle hard in a 6-4, 7-5 win over Gael Monfils, becoming the first Spaniard to reach the last eight at the Chinese ATP Masters 1000 since 2017 (Nadal, Ramos-Vinolas). In a display of bruising ball-striking paired with crafty touch from both players, Alcaraz held his nerve to improve to 3-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. [ATP APP] “The main thing I tried in this match was to stay calm, to control my emotions and wait for my chances,” said Alcaraz, who improved to 51-9 on the season. “I had a few opportunities to break his serve at the beginning of the second set [and] I couldn’t take them. In those times, I tried to stay calm and think ‘I am going to have more’. ”That helped me a lot to show my best tennis during the match. I am feeling the ball really well, much more than I was during the American swing. So, I am happy to be able to do it and keep going.” The winning streak continues 😮‍💨@carlosalcaraz defeats Monfils 6-4 7-5 to make it 12 consecutive wins and book a spot in the Shanghai final eight.@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/awYDshGIr3 — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 9, 2024 Having beaten Alcaraz at the Cincinnati Open in August, 38-year-old Monfils was bidding to emulate that form and carve his name into history as the second-oldest ATP Masters 1000 quarter-finalist in series history (since 1990), but the Spaniard had other ideas. Alcaraz, who is now into his 14th ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final, used his craft and guile to outmanoeuvre Monfils in the gruelling exchanges. The 21-year-old proved to be clinical when advancing to the forecourt, winning 88 per cent (7/8) of points at the net, according to Infosys ATP Stats. The first set was largely dominated by imposing ground strokes from both players that backed up their explosive serves, but it was Alcaraz who was forced to fend off the first break point of the match in the sixth game. Monfils appeared to be in a strong position to snatch the opener, but a lapse in concentration handed his opponent a crucial break in the ninth game. Carlos Crushing Forehands 🚀@carlosalcaraz delivers a massive #ShotQuality of 9⃣.2⃣, with his fastest forehand clocking in at 1⃣1⃣0⃣mph💥#ShotQuality is calculated in real-time by analysing each shot's speed, spin, depth, width, and the impact it has on the opponent… pic.twitter.com/WCeVvaK9oO— Tennis Insights (@tennis_insights) October 9, 2024 In the 10th game of the second set, Monfils struck two ferocious forehand winners en route to clawing the scoreline back to deuce and building the tension inside centre court. However, Alcaraz kept his cool to come out of the game unscathed. Alcaraz drew on this momentum to surge to an ultimately decisive break in the next game. The No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings then sealed victory on serve in one hour and 27 minutes to set up a quarter-final clash with Tomas Machac, who rallied to oust eleventh seed Tommy Paul 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 in an entertaining fourth-round encounter. Alcaraz remains on a collision course with Jannik Sinner, who battled past Ben Shelton 6-4, 7-6(1), to meet in the last four. Alcaraz defeated the Italian last Wednesday in an absorbing showdown to clinch the China Open title, his fourth of the season (Indian Wells, Roland Garros, Wimbledon). “It’s a great goal to reach the semi-finals, let’s see if he can make it as well,\" said Alcaraz, who leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 6-4. “I’ve been watching his matches before mine, he’s playing at a great level, and it helps me to put on a good show before I step on the court.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
