The former No. 3 player in the PIF ATP Rankings defeated Shintaro Mochizuki 6-2, 6-3 in the final to win the Lexus Nottingham Open. At 36 years and eight months, Cilic broke Andy Murray‚Äôs record for oldest grass-court Challenger titlist (36 years and one month, two years ago in Nottingham). üá≠üá∑ üá≠üá∑ üá≠üá∑ üá≠üá∑ üá≠üá∑ The moment Marin Cilic becomes the first Croatian to win a Challenger title on grass!#ATPChallenger | @cilic_marin pic.twitter.com/arJNBvsAcg ‚Äî ATP Challenger Tour (@ATPChallenger) June 21, 2025 Cilic saved a match point in the semi-finals against Martin Landaluce and carried his momentum into the championship match. The first Croatian to win a grass-court Challenger saved the only break point he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. This year‚Äôs Girona Challenger champion became the seventh player to claim ATP Challenger Tour events on clay and grass in the same season. He has lifted four Challenger trophies in his career. Before Girona, he had not triumphed at the level since May 2007 in Rijeka. Cilic on Monday will return to the Top 100 of the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time since August 2023. The 21-time tour-level titlist, who was unranked last January, will climb 16 spots to World No. 85. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Carlos Alcaraz captured his 250th tour-level win in style Saturday at the HSBC Championships, where he sealed his return to the Queen‚Äôs Club final. The top-seeded Spaniard delivered a classy showing to sink countryman Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4, 6-4 and extend his winning streak to 17 matches. Alcaraz, who triumphed on his Queen‚Äôs Club debut in 2023, is the third fastest man to reach 250 wins among players that began their career in the Open Era. ‚ÄúI just feel that I‚Äôm playing great tennis and feeling more comfortable after each match,‚Äù said Alcaraz, who improved to 3-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Bautista Agut. ‚ÄúMaking the final here at Queen‚Äôs once again is so special, so I guess grass mode is activated.‚Äù Fewest matches played to earn 250 tour-level wins in Open Era (players that debuted in Open Era) ¬†Player ¬†W-L at 250th win ¬†John McEnroe ¬†250-57 ¬†Rafael Nadal ¬†250-60 ¬†Carlos Alcaraz ¬†250-61 ¬†Boris Becker¬† ¬†250-69 ¬†Ivan Lendl ¬†250-71 ¬†Mats Wilander¬† ¬†250-71 By improving to 26-1 since his shock opening-round defeat to David Goffin at the ATP Masters 1000 in Miami, Alcaraz is into his fifth consecutive final. He will face Jiri Lehecka, who upset second seed and home favourite Jack Draper 6-4, 4-6, 7-5. In Saturday‚Äôs semi-final clash with the 37-year-old Bautista Agut, it took until just the fifth point for Alcaraz to pull out his bag of tricks: Heading for the back fence to chase down a pinpoint lob, Alcaraz responded with a near-perfect ‚Äòtweener attempt, but Bautista Agut did well to put it away with a clinical smash. However, Alcaraz‚Äôs showmanship continued throughout the opening set, which he fittingly closed out with a sumptuous drop volley that trickled just milimetres over the net before stopping dead. It forged a smile from both players, but Alcaraz remained in control during the second set, in which he saved the only break point he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. ‚ÄúI always say that I love playing tennis, I love stepping on the court and putting on a show for the crowd, making them enjoy watching my games,‚Äù said Alcaraz. ‚ÄúEvery time I put a smile on my face, I show my best tennis, so I try to do that. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm getting good results.‚Äù Alcaraz, who owns a Tour-leading 42 wins and four titles this season, will hope to have that smile on his face during Sunday‚Äôs final. He will face a stern test from Lehecka, who has been displaying supreme grass-court tennis all week, having dropped serve on just two occasions. The 23-year-old Lehecka will also be able to gain confidence from their most previous meeting in Doha, where he upset the Spaniard in the quarter-finals to level their Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 1-1. Alcaraz is now 2,070 points clear of second-placed Jannik Sinner in the PIF ATP Live Race To Tuin, which is an indicator as to who will claim the ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours.
