It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/darderi-taberner-umag-2025-final-report",
    "description": "Luciano Darderi maintained his perfect record in ATP Tour finals on Saturday at the Plava Laguna Croatia Open Umag, where he downed Carlos Taberner 6-3, 6-3 to win his second title in as many weeks. The Italian triumphed at the ATP 250 in Bastad last week and backed that up in Umag, where he used his brutal baseline power to blast through the draw and become just the third man to win at least three tour-level titles this year, joining Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Bublik, who also won his second consecutive trophy in Kitzbuehel on Saturday. \"It is something special for me,\" Darderi said. \"The last month has been crazy. I just want to thank my dad and my whole team. Without them it would be impossible. I am very happy about the title. \"It was two crazy weeks. If you told me this two weeks ago, I'd say it was impossible. But I am very happy with my performance and my tennis was incredible this week. I will try to rest now and continue to play like this in the next week on hard courts.\" In the final game of the match, Darderi seemed to roll his ankle when he brought up match point. Visibly limping, the Italian managed to seal victory in the following point before he collapsed to the court in the Umag rain. Unable to walk properly, Taberner demonstrated great sportsmanship to help the second seed to his feet, with Darderi then receiving treatment on his ankle ahead of the trophy ceremony. Darderi, a four-time tour-level champion, is up 11 spots to No. 35 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings following his run at the clay-court ATP 250. The 23-year-old began July at No. 59, but has climbed to within three spots of his career high No. 32 after winning nine consecutive matches across Bastad and Umag. In the pair’s first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, rain fell for the majority of the 86-minute clash but it did not deter the second seed. Darderi struck 20 winners to 17 unforced errors and a forehand winner at 3-2 in the first set was enough to earn him the crucial break in the first set. The Italian looked in control throughout the second set and is now 19-1 on clay in 2025 against players outside the Top 30, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Taberner upset top seed Francisco Cerundolo en route to his maiden tour-level final. The Spaniard leaves Croatia up 27 spots at No. 84 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and is set to rise to a career high on Monday. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Alexander Bublik captured his second consecutive tour-level title on Saturday at the Generali Open in Kitzbuehel, where he defeated Frenchman Arthur Cazaux for the second week in a row to lift the trophy at the ATP 250. Bublik moved past Cazaux en route to the crown in Gstaad last week and came out on top against the 22-year-old once again to taste title success at the clay-court event in the final. \"I can't believe I did it as it was probably one of the toughest weeks in my life because coming from Gstaad, playing here, different conditions and raining. I am pleased I got through and thank you for supporting me throughout the tournament,\" said Bublik, who has won three of the past four events he has played. In rainy conditions, the top seed overpowered Cazaux with his weight and depth of shot. Bublik hit freely in the first set to lead and then raised his level further during the second set, combining bruising forehands with deft drop shots to improve to 3-0 in the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series. \"I knew he was having the week of his life,\" Bublik said on Cazaux. \"That was my 14th final. but I remember the first one like it was yesterday. It was very tough but I wish him all the success. I used the few chances I had and I am happy to have won.\" Bublik, who hit 26 winners, has now won his past eight matches, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He holds a 17-2 record since Roland Garros, where he reached his first major quarter-final. By triumphing in Kitzbuehel, the 28-year-old has lifted three trophies in a season for the first time, having won Gstaad and the ATP 500 event in Halle in June. The 28-year-old upset World No. 1 Jannik Sinner en route to the crown in Germany. Bublik is up five spots to No. 25 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. He is also up five places in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, sitting 11th. The Kazakhstani joins Casper Ruud (2021) and Matteo Berrettini (2024) as the third player in the past five years to win Gstaad and Kitzbuehel back-to-back. Cazaux was competing in his maiden tour-level final. The Frenchman has climbed 25 spots to No. 75 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings following his run. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
