    "description": "Luciano Darderi rode a Nordea Open rollercoaster on Monday afternoon in Bastad, but the Italian ultimately held firm for a three-set debut victory at the clay ATP 250. The sixth-seeded Darderi prevailed 6-2, 2-6, 6-2 against Raphael Collignon to advance and set a second-round meeting with Tristan Boyer or Elias Ymer by the Swedish seaside. In his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Collignon, Darderi steadied himself after a second-set lapse to seal a two-hour, 10-minute win. ‚ÄúI have to say congratulations to Raphael. He played the second set amazingly,‚Äù said the No. 55 in the PIF ATP Rankings in his on-court interview. ‚ÄúI went a little bit crazy in some games but then in the third set I came back again.
