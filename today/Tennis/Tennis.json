    "description": "Croatia and Argentina have qualified for the United Cup in 2025 and round out the top 18 countries set to compete across Perth and Sydney from 27 December to 5 January. Croatia will be led by Paris Olympic Games singles silver medallist and Wimbledon semifinalist Donna Vekic and former world No.12 Borna Coric for the third consecutive year. Seven-time Grand Slam doubles champion Ivan Dodig will also star as part of the Croatian side. “It’s honestly my favourite tournament of the year,” Vekic said. “We have great energy in the team.  Borna has been my friend for more than 20 years. It feels like a little family. We are not a team, we are a family. “To be pushing each other and supporting each other especially at the beginning of the year, it’s special.” Team Croatia fall into Group A in Perth to set up some thrilling matches against top seeds Team USA and Canada during the group stage. They play Team Canada in their opening tie from 10.00am Saturday 28 December at RAC Arena. Twenty-eight-year-old Vekic will face Leylah Fernandez and Coco Gauff in her singles matches. “It’s going to be two really tough matches to start the year. But that’s what we want, I think it’s great preparation for the Australian Open. I think I’ll have to train extra harder in the off season, which is great motivation as well.” Argentina, led by world No.40 Tomas Martin Etcheverry and Nadia Podoroska, complete Group F. This is Argentina’s second appearance at the United Cup. Podoroska – a Roland Garros semifinalist in 2020 – and Etcheverry return to represent their country after doing so at the inaugural event in 2023. They face host country Australia on the opening night of play in Sydney from 5.30pm on Saturday 28 December at Ken Rosewall Arena followed by Great Britain two days later.",

    "description": "Hamad Medjedovic found a fitting way to register his first tour-level hard-court win of 2024 on Sunday at the Belgrade Open. With countryman Novak Djokovic watching from the stands, the Serbian wild card edged past sixth seed Brandon Nakashima 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 to advance to the second round. Medjedovic had his work cut out against the No. 35 in the PIF ATP Rankings, but he stood firm to record a two-hour triumph. “It was a tough match, he was a better player in the first, and in the second I was trying to keep my nerves and find my game,” said Medjedovic, who improved to 8-6 over Top 50 opponents. “Slowly, step by step, I found my game and I was back on track.” [ATP APP] In a battle of the two previous Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champions, Medjedovic shook off a sluggish start to dial in on serve in the second, during which he won 86 per cent (19/22) of points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Nakashima carved out two break opportunities in the third game of the decider, but Medjedovic held his nerve to seal victory. The World No. 158 will next face qualifier Branko Djuric or Aleksander Kovacevic in the second round. On a day of comebacks in Belgrade, Fabian Marozsan rallied to defeat #NextGenATP star Shang Juncheng 2-6, 7-6(5), 7-5. Marozsan was defiant in the face of a fast start from Shang, who raced to win the first set in just 23 minutes. The Hungarian bided his time before pouncing at 5/5 in the second-set tie-break. Shang, who is fourth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, was unable to weather the momentum shift in the deciding set as Marozsan claimed his first indoor win of the season (1-4). The 25-year-old will face either Dusan Lajovic or ninth seed Mariano Navone in the second round. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
