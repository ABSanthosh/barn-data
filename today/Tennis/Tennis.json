    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/almaty-antwerp-stockholm-2024-scouting-report",
    "description": "ATP Tour action continues next week with three ATP 250 events: the Almaty Open, the European Open in Antwerp and the BNP Paribas Nordic Open in Stockholm. The top seeds are Frances Tiafoe (Almaty), Alex de Minaur (Antwerp) and Andrey Rublev (Stockholm). ATPTour.com looks at five things to watch at each tournament. FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN ALMATY 1) Top Seed Tiafoe: The American showed what he is capable of when he reached the semi-finals of the US Open. Will he be able to bring that level to the court in Almaty, where he will try to claim his first title of the season? The three-time ATP Tour champion will begin his tournament against Taro Daniel or a qualifier. 2) Tremendous Tabilo: Alejandro Tabilo has been one of the breakthrough stars of the 2024 season. The Chilean lefty began his year at No. 85 in the PIF ATP Rankings and has climbed as high as World No. 19. A champion in Auckland and Mallorca in 2024, the second seed will open his pursuit of a third trophy against Damir Dzumhur or Maximilian Marterer. 3) Mighty Machac: Quietly, Tomas Machac of Czechia has been one of the best players on the ATP Tour in the second half of the season. The Paris Olympics mixed doubles gold medalist (with Katerina Siniakova), the 23-year-old reached the Tokyo semi-finals before upsetting Carlos Alcaraz en route to the Shanghai semi-finals. Only Jannik Sinner was able to stop him. Machac, the fifth seed in Almaty, will take on Kazakhstani Timofey Skatov.   4) Shevchenko Leads Kazakhstani Charge: There are three Kazakhstanis in the Almaty main draw (before the completion of qualifying). Alexander Shevchenko, the World No. 58, leads the way. Skatov and Beibit Zhukayev received wild cards. 5) Lammons/Withrow Pushing For Turin Spot: For the second consecutive year, Nathaniel Lammons and Jackson Withrow are making a push to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals. The Americans are ninth in the PIF ATP Doubles Teams Rankings and will try to improve their standing as the top seeds in Kazakhstan. FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN ANTWERP 1) De Minaur Returns: The top seed at the Belgian ATP 250 is De Minaur, who will compete for the first time since reaching the US Open quarter-finals due to injury. The Australian is ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, and will make his return against Roberto Carballes Baena or Dominik Koepfer. 2) Tsitsipas Second Seed: One year ago, Stefanos Tsitsipas won the doubles title in Antwerp with brother Petros Tsitsipas. The Greeks are defending their crown and Stefanos is the second seed in singles. This year’s Monte-Carlo champion will attempt to add a hard-court title to his 2024 collection. He will need to be sharp from the first ball against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard or a qualifier.   3) Belgians At Home: Will there be a home champion in singles or doubles for the first time in Antwerp? Zizou Bergs, Alexander Blockx and Raphael Collignon represent Belgium and will have the support of their local fans. In doubles, Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen will try to collect hardware. 4) Retiring Gasquet: This week Richard Gasquet announced through an interview with L’Equipe that 2025 Roland Garros will be the final tournament of his illustrious career. The 2016 Antwerp champion received a wild card into the event and will search for vintage form against sixth seed Tomas Martin Etcheverry in the first round. 5) Krawietz/Puetz Top Doubles Seeds: Kevin Krawietz captured glory at the European Open in 2019 with Andres Mies. This edition, he will pursue the trophy with another countryman, Tim Puetz, with whom he is sixth in the PIF ATP Doubles Teams Rankings. The second seeds are 2023 Nitto ATP Finals competitors Santiago Gonzalez and Edouard Roger-Vasselin. [ATP APP] FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN STOCKHOLM 1) Rublev On The Bubble: Top seed Andrey Rublev is in a tight battle in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. The 26-year-old, who is trying to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the fifth consecutive year, is eighth in the Live Race. He can help secure his standing with a deep run in Stockholm, where he will play Leo Borg or Alexandre Muller in his opening match.   2) High Live Race Consequences: Rublev is not the only player competing in Stockholm who is jockeying for Live Race position. Casper Ruud and Tommy Paul are in seventh and 11th, respectively. Ruud will open against Lorenzo Sonego or a qualifier, while 2021 champion Tommy Paul will try to move past Pedro Martinez or a qualifier. 3) Borg, Wawrinka \u0026 Ymer Wild Cards: This year’s Stockholm main draw singles wild cards went to Swede Leo Borg, the son of Bjorn Borg, former World No. 3 Stan Wawrinka and home favourite Elias Ymer. Wawrinka debuted in Stockholm in 2010, when he advanced to the quarter-finals before losing to Roger Federer in three sets. 4) Former Champion Dimitrov: Grigor Dimitrov, the 2017 Nitto ATP Finals champion, is 10th in the Live Race, 645 points behind eighth-placed Rublev. The Bulgarian will hope that his fond memories of Stockholm, where he won his first ATP Tour title in 2013, help him narrow the deficit. Dimitrov will begin his event against Quentin Halys or Sumit Nagal. 5) Heliovaara/Patten Lead Doubles Field: This year’s Wimbledon doubles champions, Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten, are the top seeds in Stockholm. Having also triumphed together in Marrakech and Lyon, they will try to earn their fourth title of the season. The second seeds are Hugo Nys and Jan Zielinski. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-shanghai-2024-sf-reaction",
    "description": "Jannik Sinner clinched ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours on Saturday by reaching the Rolex Shanghai Masters final. It is a big moment for the 23-year-old, but he made clear he will not rest on his laurels. “’It’s a good feeling. I'm very happy to achieve this. It was an amazing season for me, and it's not finished yet,” Sinner said. “Tomorrow is a great final ahead, first time here in Shanghai, so I'm looking forward to it, and then we [will] see how it goes. Hopefully it's going to be a good match.” Sinner will face four-time Shanghai champion Novak Djokovic, who will try to claim his 100th tour-level title in the match. But the Italian will take confidence knowing he will finish the year as the No. 1 player in the world no matter what happens in the final weeks of the season. “Being No. 1 in the world at the end of the year, it was only a dream just to become No. 1. Now finishing it, it's also a different feeling,” Sinner said. “But now during the tournament it's a bit different, so I'm just trying to be focused for tomorrow, and then we [will] see how it goes.” Watch Sinner SF Highlights:   Could Sinner have imagined this? “Not really,” he said. The San Candido native began 2024 as World No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings and has focused on staying in the moment to rise to the top of the sport. “You cannot predict the future in one way. For me, I always try to improve as a player. For me it also depends how you start a season. If you start it in a good way like I did, winning Australia, then you have much more confidence throughout the whole season,” Sinner said of his Australian Open triumph. “The season is going amazingly, I just try to stay there every match I play, trying to find a solution somehow. That's it. “I think it's very tough to predict the future in any case, so I'm just trying to enjoy this moment, and also trying to improve daily, and then we [will] see how it goes.” List of active players to reach ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF 👇 Novak Djokovic Rafael Nadal Carlos Alcaraz Jannik Sinner End of list.#PIF | #ATPRankings | #partner pic.twitter.com/zuKvRWQYYV — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 12, 2024 Although Sinner is the first Italian to finish year-end No. 1, he is not surprised that someone from his country could do it. “I always look on my side what I have to do, and what I try to achieve. I think it's very nice for Italy because, Italy, it's a very nice country. We have everything we need. We have amazing food, we have everything,\" Sinner said. “We have mountains, we have sea, we have different mentalities coming from every part of Italy, it's just nice. “I’m very proud to be Italian, and just bringing back something for the fans, and then they are giving me so much love, so I'm happy to be in that position. But there is not only me, we are so many great players, so many we have in Top 100, Top 200. It’s amazing that the tennis is growing, and hopefully it can grow even bigger.” [ATP APP] As happy as Sinner is with what he has accomplished this season, he has no intention of slowing down. The top seed will try to claim his first Shanghai title on Sunday in front of a crowd he enjoys. “It’s an amazing atmosphere… It's nice to be part of any encounter,” Sinner said. “The fans here, you can feel the love they give to you. It's a different culture, so it's also nice to see this. “I enjoy it, it's amazing. It's also a Masters event, a very big tournament. I love to play here, to be on site, it's very nice. It’s for sure one of the best tournaments we have throughout the year, so I'm very happy and glad to have a chance to play here my first final.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
