    "description": "Joao Fonseca’s dazzling run of form continued Wednesday, when he advanced to the final round of qualifying at the Australian Open. The 18-year-old powered past Coleman Wong 6-0 6-3 in Melbourne to move within one match of making his main-draw debut at a Grand Slam. After triumphing at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in Jeddah in December and adding a second ATP Challenger Tour title to his name in Canberra last week, Fonseca is now on a 12-match winning streak. Two down, one to go! Joao Fonseca is a match away from qualifying for the #AO2025 main draw. pic.twitter.com/UgWWm80W3N — #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 8, 2025 Fonseca will play 12th seed Thiago Augustin Tirante Thursday for a spot in the main draw. Fonseca’s fellow #NextGenATP star Learner Tien, whom the Brazilian defeated in the final in Jeddah, is also through to the final round of qualifying after seeing off Juan Pablo Ficovich 6-4, 6-2. Martin Landaluce will also seek a spot in the main draw of a Grand Slam for the first time when he faces Dalibor Svrcina. The 19-year-old Spaniard, who was an alternate at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, edged James Trotter 6-4, 7-5. Former No. 16 in the PIF ATP Rankings Nikoloz Basilashvili continued his journey back to form with an impressive 7-5, 6-4 win over Alibek Kachmazov. The 32-year-old, who last competed in the main draw of a major at the 2023 Australian Open, will face Francesco Passaro in the final round of qualifying Thursday. [ATP APP] Fresh from competing for Great Britain at the United Cup, 19th seed Billy Harris cruised past Carlos Taberner 6-1, 6-2, while American Mackenzie McDonald edged countryman Brandon Holt 6-4, 6-4. Despite local wild card Dane Sweeny falling to Jaime Faria 6-2, 6-2, Australian hope remains in the form of Blake Ellis.
