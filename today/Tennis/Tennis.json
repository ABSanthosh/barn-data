    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/shang-wong-hong-kong-2025-tuesday",
    "description": "Chinese #NextGenATP star Shang Juncheng started 2024 with a breakthrough semi-final run at the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open. On Tuesday, he bookended the calendar year with a rock-solid opening win at the 2025 edition of the hard-court ATP 250. Under the lights on New Year's Eve at Victoria Park, Shang secured an absorbing 7-6(3), 6-4 triumph over local prospect Coleman Wong. \"Me and Coleman go way back to 11, 12 years old playing juniors together. Seeing him on the biggest stage with me here, in front of his home crowd, I'm really honoured,\" said the No.50 in the PIF ATP Rankings. \"It's great to be back in Hong Kong. It's such a beautiful place, such a beautiful city. It's a special place for me. 2024 started and ended here for me. I have enjoyed every moment so far on these courts.‚Äù Shang's success in Hong Kong in January provided the launchpad for him to become the first Chinese teenager ever to break inside the ATP Top 100 in May and five months later the left-hander reached a career-high World No. 47 after clinching his maiden ATP Tour title in Chengdu. \"Definitely physically I'm a little bit stronger, playing faster, but mentally I'm still the same, trying to be positive all of the time, giving it all on the court,\" added the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF competitor. \"It's been a real rollercoaster year for me and a really happy one.\" Shang faces seventh seed Pedro Martinez at the next hurdle. The Spaniard advanced 6-4, 6-4 against Francesco Passaro. Earlier on Tuesday, former World No. 2 and three-time Hong Kong champion Michael Chang, who coached Kei Nishikori for the best part of a decade from 2014, told the media that the Japanese icon would find returning to the Top 50 ‚Äòa piece of cake‚Äô if he stays fit. Nishikori's emphatic 6-2, 6-3 dismissal of Denis Shapovalov certainly set the tone for a strong start to the new season. \"This is a great start,\" said the 12-time tour-level champion Nishikori. \"The next goal is that Top 50. I'll have to go slowly, but if I can be healthy and play the whole season, I think I can do that. I can't speak too much because I'm still around 100 and I need to maybe play some Challengers, to get more points, to get more wins.\" Currently the World No. 106, Nishikori arrowed plenty of shots to keep Shapovalov consistently off balance and his vintage display set a second-round clash with third seed Karen Khachanov for New Year's Day. Winding back the clock with @keinishikori ü§©@Hkto_mens | #BOCHKTO pic.twitter.com/uPxwizsOCI ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) December 31, 2024 Nishikori leads his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Khachanov 4-2, having prevailed in their three most recent encounters. \"It's a big test, he's been playing well, especially at the end of the year,\" said Nishikori. \"Big serve, big forehand and it‚Äôs going to be very interesting. It's a good challenge for me to see how much I can play with these Top 20 guys. I'm excited.\" Nuno Borges and Zizou Bergs were among the other first-round winners in Hong Kong on Tuesday. The fifth-seeded Borges held off Buyunchaokete for a 3-6, 6-3, 7-6(6) opening win, while Bergs sunk qualifier Alejandro Moro Canas 6-4, 6-4.

    "description": "Nick Kyrgios knows a thing or two about big serving. The Australian owns one of the most devastating deliveries on the ATP Tour and has competed against some of tennis‚Äô most renowned servers, including Ivo Karlovic, John Isner and Milos Raonic. Yet Kyrgios believes he may have just experienced the toughest returning experience of his life against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard at the Brisbane International presented by Evie. ‚ÄúI obviously went into the match understanding how he played,‚Äù said Kyrgios of the fast-rising Frenchman, who fired 36 aces in the pair‚Äôs maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash. ‚ÄúI already knew that he liked to hit two first serves, but props to him, he's found what works for his game style and he's committed to that. He's going to do some damage, for sure. He's going to have a long career. ‚ÄúHe's got an easy action on his serve. There were no real dips in speed or anything like that‚Ä¶ Props to him. He's a hell of a player. I have played Karlovic, Isner, Raonic, all the big servers, and he's got the biggest serve by far. Yeah, that was interesting. And it sucked.‚Äù Despite falling to a deciding-set tie-break defeat to Mpetshi Perricard, Kyrgios also spoke positively about his own performance after making his return from an 18-month injury layoff. The 29-year-old, a former No. 13 in the PIF ATP Rankings, was delighted with his level after competing for the first time since undergoing wrist surgery in September 2023. ‚ÄúFor me, honestly, it was a great match, considering I hadn't played in 18 months,‚Äù said Kyrgios. ‚ÄúTo put myself in a winning position was exciting. It was just good to be back out there and to say that I can still play a level against someone like that, who is coming off the best year of their career and only getting better and confident, and I'm coming back and I asked the question. He just played a couple big points better than I did.‚Äù Tuesday‚Äôs match against the biggest server on Tour was undoubtedly a physical test for Kyrgios, but that did not stop him enjoying the emotional side of his long-awaited return to ATP Tour singles action. ‚ÄúI did miss the competition. I compete every day, whether it's a game on my phone or [whatever]. I love the competition,\" he said. \"I have given a lot to this sport, and everything that's come good in my life has come basically from this sport. ‚ÄúGoing out there again, playing a top player like that, super confident, even getting aced. I was 2/4 down in the third-set tie-break, change of ends, and I was still smiling to myself right in the heat of the battle. Eighteen months ago, if you asked me and my physio and my coach that's here this week, he was feeding me fluffy balls on my wrist. We were not expecting to be here playing again and at such a high level. We were literally a couple of points from winning.‚Äù [ATP APP] Having also contested a first-round doubles match on Monday in Brisbane, Kyrgios acknowledged to feeling soreness in his wrist after back-to-back match days. Yet he is feeling good about returning to court on Wednesday alongside Novak Djokovic for the pair‚Äôs second-round doubles match against top seeds Nikola Mektic and Michael Venus. ‚ÄúI felt like I had been hit by a bus yesterday after doubles, to be honest. I was on the treatment table for an hour and a half before bed,‚Äù revealed Kyrgios. ‚ÄúBut we know that's how it's going to be. Even doubles, you just can't replicate the match pressure, the nervous energy. You're returning, like these guys are professionals. The doubles guys yesterday, they were serving massive. It's still reflex and volleys. ‚ÄúFor my wrist, it's all new ground now. Today is another building block I think in the journey. I went from literally practising with people unranked in Canberra to facing the biggest server in the world in a week‚Ä¶ I think tomorrow it's going to be a bit of a rough day for my wrist, to be honest. It's very sore at the moment. We were expecting that. I'm going to do all the right things, and I'll be playing doubles, for sure.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
