    "description": "Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz, Alexander Zverev and Daniil Medvedev have qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals. This week’s Rolex Paris Masters will play a critical role in deciding who will join them. Taylor Fritz is in pole position to return to the season finale, to be played from 10-17 November, for the second time. In 2022, the American reached the semi-finals in Turin. The fifth-placed Fritz has 4,290 points and can guarantee his place at the year-end championships by making the quarter-finals at the season's final ATP Masters 1000 event. There are also other scenarios in which he would qualify earlier in the tournament based on the performance of players below him in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. PIF ATP Live Race To Turin (entering Paris)  Player  Points  5) Taylor Fritz  4,290  6) Novak Djokovic  3,910  7) Casper Ruud  3,845  8) Andrey Rublev  3,720  9) Alex de Minaur  3,555  10) Grigor Dimitrov  3,150  11) Tommy Paul  3,135  12) Stefanos Tsitsipas  2,975 Sixth-placed Novak Djokovic is not competing in Paris. Since the Serbian is 380 points behind the American, Fritz is guaranteed to finish the regular season ahead of him in the Live Race. Only 290 points separate seventh-placed Casper Ruud (3,845 points) and ninth-placed Alex de Minaur (3,555 points). Ruud (2) and Rublev (4) have made multiple Nitto ATP Finals appearances in the past, while De Minaur is trying to make his tournament debut. \"I'm looking over my shoulder because there are a lot of guys that can do really well here and even next week also counts,\" Ruud said. \"So there will still be a few more days or weeks of kind of nervous sleeping and thinking about it. But it's okay. \"I'm in the position where if I do well it looks like I might be able to qualify, especially if I do well this week. So I'm just going to think about myself, not going to think about things I can't control in terms of what other players do. But it's getting tense. It's becoming a really, really interesting Race and a close Race. A lot of things can still happen this week.\" [ATP APP] Tenth-placed Grigor Dimitrov, the 2017 Nitto ATP Finals champion, 11th-placed Tommy Paul and 12th-placed Stefanos Tsitsipas, the 2019 season finale winner, need deep runs in Paris to keep alive their dreams of qualifying. Three potential Rolex Paris Masters third-round matches are Fritz facing De Minaur, Ruud taking on Paul and Rublev playing Tsitsipas. Each would be critical in not only the tournament, but also the Live Race. The Belgrade Open and the Moselle Open, two ATP 250 events the week after Paris, also count towards the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and qualification for the Nitto ATP Finals. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
