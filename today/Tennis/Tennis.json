    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/carlos-bernardes-retirement-feature-2024",
    "description": "For more than three decades, chair umpire Carlos Bernardes enjoyed the best seat in the house. One of the sport's most respected officials, the Brazilian has presided over some of the game’s most memorable showdowns in tennis’s grandest arenas. From Sampras and Agassi to the unforgettable Federer-Nadal rivalries, Bernardes has been right there, courtside, keeping order. His storied journey came to a fitting close on the ATP Tour this week at the Nitto ATP Finals, where he officiated his final ATP Tour match in the title showdown. Bernardes reminisced on his career to ATPTour.com in Turin. \"My first contact with tennis was as a kid in Brazil. We used to jump the fence to play at the local club until we finally registered there. Since then, I’ve been part of the game, and I feel so fortunate to have had these experiences,” Bernardes said. [ATP AWARDS] In 1984, Bernardes began coaching and soon found his way into officiating as a line judge at a regional Billie Jean King Cup tie in Sao Paulo. Balancing coaching and officiating across South America, his breakthrough came in 1992 when he joined the ATP Tour as a chair umpire. \"I started with tournaments in South America, then got assigned to the United States. I remember an early event in San Jose in 1996,\" he said with a smile. \"That tournament featured Sampras, Agassi, and Chang. Sampras was No. 1. It was incredible — to go from playing tennis on Brazilian streets to umpiring Sampras and Agassi.\" Carlos Bernardes with ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi in Turin. Photo Credit: Corinne Dubreuil/ATP Tour Out of the 29 players to reach No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Bernardes had the privilege of officiating 24 of them. From Mats Wilander to Jannik Sinner, he’s witnessed historic moments and built lasting relationships with the game’s biggest stars. “I’ve done matches with Sampras, Agassi, Chang, Edberg, Wilander, Becker. It was great to see Boris Becker here in Turin this week. He came up to talk to me, which was nice. Becker had such charisma on court. And the Sampras-Agassi matches were unforgettable.” Bernardes recalls the ‘special’ era of Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, and Novak Djokovic, and the thrill of umpiring Andy Murray, Juan Martin del Potro, and Stan Wawrinka. “I think some of my longest matches were with Murray — four hours on court, and he’d still push through. I’d see him later and ask, ‘How did you do it?’ and he’d say, ‘I can’t walk now,’ but he’d be back on court the next day winning. That respect from players means a lot.” One of Bernardes’ fondest memories is umpiring Rafael Nadal’s first ATP Tour match in Mallorca in 2002, followed by Nadal's first encounter with Federer in Miami (2004). He also officiated the 2011 Wimbledon final, where Novak Djokovic defeated Nadal to claim the title and ascend to No. 1. “Wimbledon is magic,” Bernardes said. “I started playing tennis because of Wimbledon. Getting to umpire on Centre Court — it’s incomparable. That 2011 final was truly special.” Bernardes has seen first-hand how the sport has grown, evolved and changed, making him a fountain of knowledge in regard to the history of the game. The 60-year-old became a key part of the travelling roadshow that is the ATP Tour, journeying countless miles and spending years of his life in hotels. “I love Melbourne — I can walk back to the hotel at 2 a.m! Tokyo was always ahead of the game,\" Bernardes said when speaking about his favourite cities. \"Monte-Carlo is beautiful, especially when it’s not raining. And New York, where I umpired at my first Grand Slam, is always unforgettable. “Barcelona too. It is a proper tennis event. If you want to see a tennis event, that is the one to go with. There may be two guys who are lower ranked, but it will be packed in the stands.” [ATP APP] Today, Bernardes leaves a sport transformed by technology. Electronic line calling is already widespread and will be mandatory on the Tour by 2025, with limited trials of video review underway. Though Bernardes embraced the high-stakes pressure of making line calls, he understands the shift. “It’s different now with electronic calls — you don’t talk to players as much. There’s no need to overrule or explain calls. Now, I just listen to the music in the stadium. It’s becoming more mechanical, and we need to be cautious. I enjoyed the pressure of making the right call. Now, even if I think a ball is out, I sit back and let technology decide.” Seated in the officiating room at Turin's Inalpi Arena, Bernardes reflects warmly on his memories. His eyes light up most, though, when he speaks of the people he’s met. “I have so many stories, and I’m lucky. I’ve done over 8,000 matches — just 1 percent of that leaves plenty of memories,” Bernardes said. “But it’s the people I’ve met that stand out. We’re away from home for half our lives, so you embrace the people and the places. This year, fans and people came up to me — that’s been wonderful. It’s a great environment to be part of.” Bernardes will finish his career next week at the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga but received warm words from Jannik Sinner following the title match at the Nitto ATP Finals, which the Brazilian umpired. \"Carlos, it's been an amazing career,\" Sinner said. \"I feel privileged to be part of your last ATP journey.\" Jannik Sinner shakes hands with Carlos Bernardes.

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/fritz-nitto-atp-finals-2024-final-reaction",
    "description": "Taylor Fritz made significant progress in 2024. The American reached his maiden major final at the US Open and this week advanced to the title match at the Nitto ATP Finals, ending the season at a career-high No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings. The American lost in straight sets to Jannik Sinner in the final in Turin on Sunday night but is delighted with his year overall. “It's been a really good week for me. Obviously, it's a good way to end the year. It gives me a lot of confidence finishing the season like this,” Fritz said. “Something I told my team in 2023 when I hit World No. 5 for a week right before I was defending the Indian Wells title, was 'That's crazy, I'm five the world, look at all these guys ranked behind me that are probably better than me’. “Back then I was five, but I didn't feel like I was five. Now I'm ranked where I'm at. I feel like I belong. It's a different feeling. It's been a great year. That gives me a lot of confidence to have that belief. That's a huge part of having the big results. The goals I set for myself at the start of the year was to finish Top 5.” Fritz earned wins against Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Alex de Minaur to become the first American to reach the Nitto ATP Finals title match since James Blake in 2006. However, the 27-year-old had no answers against Sinner, who also beat the fifth seed in the round-robin stage by the same scoreline as the final. Fritz was full of praise for World No. 1 Sinner. “He's playing great. I felt from the baseline, it was pretty similar to the previous match we played. What I was really impressed with today was how he served,” said Fritz on Sinner, who made 71 per cent of his first serves according to Infosys ATP Stats. “He served absolutely lights out. So many lines. He placed the serve great. He took a lot of risk on the second serve as well. I think that was probably one of his main game plans, to not let me attack his second serve. \"He did a great job of not only mixing up the second but being very aggressive with it, not throwing in double-faults for serving bigger and being a little riskier with it. I was really impressed with how he served.” [ATP AWARDS] Fritz will finish his season at the Davis Cup Finals next week but leaves Turin holding a 52-23 record. The American feels he knows where he can improve heading into 2025. “I definitely need to get more explosive and quicker in the first step,” said Fritz. “If I can just get a little quicker off the split step, it will help my return of serve a lot. If I can just put myself in slightly better chances to break serve, I think that's going to be a huge improvement. That's something I've done already, but I think there's still a lot of room for improvement there. “Something that got exposed today is when the balls got pretty worn out, I was struggling to generate any power with my backhand. It allowed him to take control of a lot of points. When the balls were newer, that wasn't really an issue. I was able to stay in the points.” Fritz, who won tour-level titles in Delray Beach and Eastbourne in 2024, will hope to improve his record against the very best in 2025, with the American holding a 0-11 record against World No. 1's. The 27-year-old leads a group of five Americans (Tommy Paul, Frances Tiafoe, Ben Shelton, Sebastian Korda) inside the Top 25 into 2025. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
