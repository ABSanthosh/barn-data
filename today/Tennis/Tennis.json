It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Nine sets played, nine sets won for Ben Shelton at this year’s Wimbledon. The 22-year-old American downed Hungarian lucky loser Marton Fucsovics 6-3, 7-6(4), 6-2 to become the youngest American to make three major fourth-round appearances in a year since Andy Roddick in 2004. “I had a lot of fun today. It is always special playing here at Wimbledon,” Shelton said. “This is my third time playing on Court 1. It is a special atmosphere. I am trying to make my way to Centre, Court, maybe I will get there one day. “I’ve been playing well this week. It is not just me, I have a great team. My parents are here. My girlfriend is here. Also, my sister is here and she’s been here for every match that I have played so far but she has work back in the US starting Monday.” Into the fourth round at Wimbledon for the second consecutive year, Shelton will next play Lorenzo Sonego for the third consecutive major after the Italian won a five-set thriller. In a five-hour, four-minute epic, Sonego overcame American Brandon Nakashima 6-7(5), 7-6(8), 7-6(2), 3-6, 7-6(10-3). Sonego, who fired 75 winners and rallied from a break down in the fifth set against Nakashima, trails Shelton 1-3 in the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series. This year, Shelton defeated Sonego in the quarter-finals at the Australian Open and the first round at Roland Garros. Earlier, Flavio Cobolli continued his stellar 2025 campaign by defeating #NextGenATP Jakub Mensik 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach the fourth round at a major for the first time. Cobolli carved out 17 break points against the big-serving Czech and converted 12 of them to triumph in their maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash. After winning his first two ATP Tour titles in Bucharest and Hamburg earlier this year, Cobolli is up to a career-high No. 20 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. The 23-year-old will next face former Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic at the All England Club. Cilic backed up his win against fourth seed Jack Draper by defeating Jaume Munar 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4. The 36-year-old, who reached the Wimbledon final in 2017, is competing at the grass-court major for the first time since 2021. Playing with confidence, he fired 49 winners past Munar to advance to the last 16 for the first time since he reached the title match. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
