    "description": "Francisco Cerundolo overcame a testing three-set battle on Friday at the Nordea Open in Bastad, where he held firm to return to the semi-finals at the clay-court ATP 250. The top-seeded Argentine weathered a free-hitting yet physically hampered Damir Dzumhur, who took three medical timeouts to treat his right shoulder, to ultimately prevail 6-0, 3-6, 6-3. With his one-hour, 46-minute victory, Cerundolo improved to a 21-9 clay-court record in 2025, trailing only World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz for the most wins on the surface this year. ‚ÄúI try to take it in a positive way,‚Äù said Cerundolo, who won his maiden ATP Tour title in Bastad in 2022, when asked about the pressures of being the top seed. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm the top seed here it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve done pretty well during the year, so I take it as a compliment, not a pressure. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tough to maintain that level when you start playing a match really good. After the first set, he started playing better, and I maybe started to relax a little. It was super difficult after that but I‚Äôm happy because it was a super tough win for me.‚Äù 2025 ATP Tour clay-court win leaders ¬†Player ¬†W-L ¬†Carlos Alcaraz ¬†22-1 ¬†Francisco Cerundolo ¬†21-9 ¬†Lorenzo Musetti¬† ¬†19-4 ¬†Alexander Zverev ¬†18-7 The three-time ATP Tour champion, Cerundolo is up one spot to No. 19 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, and will return to his career-high No. 18 on Monday if he reclaims the trophy in Bastad. He next faces Luciano Darderi, who delivered a resounding quarter-final statement to defeat fourth seed Sebastian Baez 6-0, 6-2. The 23-year-old Italian was in peak form during his 64-minute win, in which he dropped just two of 19 first-serve points and did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Darderi, who is now into his fifth ATP Tour semi-final, impressed even himself with his high-quality showing. ‚ÄúToday, I don‚Äôt know what happened, I played unbelievable, probably the best match of my career,‚Äù said Darderi. ‚ÄúIf I play like this, it‚Äôs going to be easier [in the semi-finals], but I will try to do my best.‚Äù Uplayable Luciano üò± Darderi dismantles Baez 6-0 6-2 for his second ATP Tour semi-final of 2025!@NordeaOpen | #NordeaOpen | @Lucianodarderi_ pic.twitter.com/AlvW5vqPy1 ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) July 18, 2025 Darderi, who won his second ATP Tour title in Marrakech in April, will look to carry his momentum into Saturday‚Äôs semi-final clash against top seed Cerundolo, who leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 2-1. In the other half of the draw, Camilo Ugo Carabelli surged past Austrian qualifier Filip Misolic 6-3, 7-5 to book his spot in his third ATP Tour semi-final of the season after deep runs in Rio and Santiago in February. This week in Bastad, the Argentine has jumped nine spots to a career-high No. 50 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. Standing between Ugo Carabelli and a maiden ATP Tour final is Dutchman Jesper de Jong, who rallied to upset good friend and countryman Tallon Griekspoor. De Jong, who improved to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Griekspoor, prevailed 4-6, 7-6(3), 6-3 to reach his second tour-level semi-final. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/toronto-2025-tournament-feature-five-things",
    "description": "The National Bank Open Presented by Rogers returns to Toronto from July 26 to August 7, welcoming the ATP Tour's finest to Sobeys Stadium for another exhilarating tournament. The Canadian ATP Masters 1000 boasts a prestigious roll of former winners, including Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Andy Murray, and Andre Agassi. It has long been known for its passionate crowds, vibrant host city, and memorable matches. This year marks a new chapter for the tournament, with expanded scheduling, fresh branding, and a player field loaded with storylines. With excitement building in Canada‚Äôs largest city, ATPTour.com highlights five key things to know ahead of this year‚Äôs event. The Tennis Playground: A new era for the National Bank Open The 2025 edition of the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers introduces a bold new identity: The Tennis Playground. Unveiled earlier this year, the refreshed branding marks a shift in how the tournament is presented, not just as a world-class competition, but as an immersive celebration of tennis culture and community. Visitors will discover an atmosphere where live music, interactive games, local food trucks, and artistic activations enhance the experience beyond the baseline. The vision reflects a broader commitment to accessibility, sustainability, and fan engagement. Tournament Director Karl Hale described the evolution best: ‚ÄúThe Tennis Playground is the perfect new identity for the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers. It gives us the licence to focus on both the action taking place on the court and all the great work being done off it to grow our sport.‚Äù A new 12-day format brings more tennis, more access For the first time in its history, the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers will adopt a 12-day format, aligning with the expanded scheduling of most ATP Masters 1000 tournaments (7/9). This change means more matches, more sessions, and more chances for fans to catch the world‚Äôs best in action. The event begins on Saturday, July 26, with the popular Family Weekend featuring kid-friendly programming, player appearances, and access to early-round qualifying matches. From August 4-7, the tournament enters Championship Week with night sessions only, offering a high-energy primetime atmosphere for fans and a more viewer-friendly format. Players will also see the benefits of an extended schedule, allowing for better rest and recovery between rounds. Sinner, Alcaraz headline star-studded field The top two players in the PIF ATP Rankings, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, headline a 2025 field loaded with star power. Both are set to bring their explosive games to Sobeys Stadium, returning to ATP Tour action for the first time since Sinner emerged victorious in their Wimbledon final earlier this month. For Sinner, this marks a return to the site of his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title in 2023, a breakthrough that sparked his ascent to the top of the sport. Fans can expect high-intensity rallies and fearless shot-making from Alcaraz, who comes back for his first appearance at the event since 2023. Jannik Sinner won his maiden ATP Masters 1000 trophy in Toronto in 2023. Photo:¬†Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images. Canadian hopes ride on former Top 10 stars Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov, who are each aiming to add more silverware to their resume. Gabriel Diallo also offers new expectations for the nation after the 23-year-old has enjoyed a stellar rise this year, highlighted by his maiden ATP Tour title at ‚Äòs-Hertogenbosh last month. Can Sinner extend his hard-court dominance? Sinner‚Äôs form on hard courts has been nothing short of exceptional. The World No. 1 enters Toronto riding an 18-match winning streak on the surface, a stretch that includes triumphs at the Nitto ATP Finals and the ATP Masters 1000 in Shanghai last year, and a successful title defence at the Australian Open in January. In 2024, Sinner compiled a staggering 53-3 record on hard courts, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. While 17 of his 20 tour-level titles have come on the surface, Toronto remains especially meaningful as it was the site of his first ATP Masters 1000 trophy. ‚ÄúIt feels amazing. It‚Äôs a great result, one I can share with all my team, with the hard work we put in,‚Äù Sinner said after defeating Alex de Minaur in the final. ‚ÄúVery happy about the whole tournament, it‚Äôs a really great moment in my career.‚Äù Former champions aim for another shot at glory in 2025 As well as Sinner, four-time champion Djokovic, World No. 3 Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and last year‚Äôs surprise winner in Montreal Alexei Popyrin all enter the tournament with something to prove. Fresh from reaching the semi-finals at all three major tournaments this year, Djokovic arrives in Toronto chasing a record-extending 41st ATP Masters 1000 title. The 38-year-old will face competition from the likes of Zverev and Medvedev, who both tasted title success in Canada in 2017 and 2021, respectively. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
