Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Washington top seed Taylor Fritz might face a rematch with big-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard at the Mubadala Citi DC Open following Saturday‚Äôs release of the draw for the combined ATP/WTA 500. Mpetshi Perricard, who must win a first-round match with Australian Aleksandar Vukic to set a showdown with Fritz, dropped 37 aces and led the American No. 1 by two sets in the Wimbledon first round before the Californian dug in for a five-set win. [ATP APP] The 22-year-old from Lyon also fired the fastest recorded serve in Wimbledon history - a 153 mph/246 kph thunderbolt - during his clash with Fritz, who went on to reach the semi-finals to cap an impressive grass-court swing that included titles in Stuttgart and Eastbourne. Fritz is playing the historic Washington event for the fifth time. His best result was a semi-final showing in 2023. Mpetshi Perricard, No. 45 in the PIF ATP Rankings, reached the third round on debut last year. Saturday‚Äôs draw also threw up another potential big-serving opening-round challenge for former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev, who faces the winner of 6‚Äô 11‚Äù American Reilly Opelka and a qualifier. Second seed Lorenzo Musetti could face recent Wimbledon quarter-finalist Cameron Norrie in his opener. Third seed Holger Rune is seeded to meet 13th-seeded American Alex Michelsen in the third round. Fourth seed Ben Shelton is seeded to meet countryman and D.C.‚Äôs favourite son Frances Tiafoe in the quarter-finals. Shelton leads the Lexus ATP Head2Head series 2-1. Main draw action begins Monday.

    "description": "Luciano Darderi dug deep into his energy reserves on Saturday evening in Bastad to pull off his maiden Top 20 victory and simultaneously book a final spot at the Nordea Open. The Italian overcame top seed Francisco Cerundolo 6-2, 3-6, 7-6(3) in hot conditions at the Swedish ATP 250 to reach his third tour-level championship match. Darderi rallied from 2-4 in the final set to prevail in a match featuring 11 breaks of serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and set a Sunday final against Jesper de Jong. WHAT. A. MATCH. üò±@Lucianodarderi_ is final bound in Bastad, outlasting the top seed Cerundolo in three tight sets 6-2 3-6 7-6(3)! @NordeaOpen | #NordeaOpen pic.twitter.com/7KvwucebF6‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) July 19, 2025 ‚ÄúPlaying against Francisco is always very tough. Today I played an amazing match, but in front of me I had one of the best players in the world,‚Äù said Darderi in his on-court interview. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never easy to play against a friend, too, but I played a great match. I fought until the last point, and I think that was the key to the match today.‚Äù Darderi had dropped just six games across his previous two matches in Bastad, against Elias Ymer and Sebastian Baez, respectively. Yet there was nothing straightforward about the Italian‚Äôs victory against World No. 20 Cerundolo, even after he raced through the opening set. Darderi was broken twice in the second set and twice more early in the third set, but he regained his edge to complete a comeback win, his biggest by PIF ATP Ranking. With his two-hour, 34-minute triumph, Darderi avenged 2025 defeats to Cerundolo in Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro and levelled the pair‚Äôs Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 2-2. He will step on court Sunday with a 2-0 record in ATP Tour finals after his triumphs in Cordoba last year and Marrakech in April. The man aiming to end Darderi‚Äôs perfect record in finals will be De Jong after the Dutchman earlier defeated Camilo Ugo Carabelli 6-3, 7-6(3). It will be a maiden ATP Tour title match for the 25-year-old Dutchman, whose run in Bastad so far has propelled him 23 spots to No. 83 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. \"It's better than my coach, because he was a semi-finalist here in 2013, and now I did better than him, so I won't forget it,\" joked De Jong about his coach Thiemo de Bakker in his on-court interview. \"I'm very happy to be in my first ATP final. I was a little bit shaky at the end at 6-5, but that happens and it turned out great.\" [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
