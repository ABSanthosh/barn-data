It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/atp-statement-18-march-2025",
    "description": "Since the inception of the ATP Tour in 1990, ATP has played a leading role in the global growth of men’s professional tennis. Throughout more than three decades, ATP’s 50-50 governance structure has ensured that players and tournaments have an equal voice in shaping the sport’s direction at the highest level. Recent years have brought about transformative changes for players. The introduction of a prize money formula, record-setting on-site prize money, and new and expanded Bonus Pools have contributed to a major increase in player compensation (up $70 million in the past five years). The introduction of annual, independent audits has given players full transparency over tournament financials at ATP events. ATP’s Baseline programme has introduced minimum guaranteed income for the Top 250-ranked singles players, providing unprecedented financial security in professional tennis. Contributions to the player pension fund have surged, while prize money at ATP Challenger Tour events has more than doubled - reinforcing ATP’s commitment to strengthening the player pathway. These advancements have been achieved through ATP’s governance structure, with every key decision made with player input and by their elected representatives. Meanwhile, players - as independent contractors - have retained extensive control over their schedules, allowing them the flexibility to compete, train, and monetise their careers as they see fit. While ATP has remained focused on delivering reforms that benefit players at multiple levels, the PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress. Five years on from its inception in 2020, the PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising.  We strongly reject the premise of the PTPA’s claims, believe the case to be entirely without merit, and will vigorously defend our position. ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game - towards continued growth, financial stability, and the best possible future for our players, tournaments, and fans.",
