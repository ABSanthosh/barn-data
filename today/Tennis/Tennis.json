It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "title": "Royer rising: The Frenchman forged in Eastern Europe",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/royer-challenger-2025-feature",
    "description": "Despite being born in the outskirts of Paris, Valentin Royer’s earliest memories are not the sounds of a French café or busy cobblestone streets. The Frenchman instead spent much of his childhood across countries like Czechia, Poland and Serbia, where life carried a different tone. Now 23 and thriving on the ATP Challenger Tour, Royer recalls first picking up a racquet in Czechia. Royer moved between the aforementioned countries during a 15-year span and learned lessons that continue to shape who he is today. “The major thing that stands out in Eastern Europe is this work ethic. They are not afraid to work,” Royer told ATPTour.com. “Most often, these guys play tennis not just for fun, but to live. They really want to succeed in life through tennis. It’s a little bit like just work, or die. It brought me work discipline that sometimes in western Europe we are not used to.” At around age 14, Royer was living in Belgrade, Serbia and training at the Tipsarevic Tennis Academy, founded by former World No. 8 in the PIF ATP Rankings Janko Tipsarevic. Royer trained there for two years while his father, Quentin, worked for a supermarket brand. Royer returned to Paris for his senior year of high school, but his time in Serbia’s capital city left a lasting impact, especially the moments he had under Tipsarevic’s guidance. “He has high standards, of course. When you come to him and say you have a project to be Top 100 or you have a dream to be Top 10, you have to set the bar pretty high and the discipline and work ethic pretty high,” Royer said. Royer was initially more drawn to golf than tennis as a young kid. He also enjoyed wakeboarding and surfing. But as he approached his pre-teen years, his focus shifted. He had dreams of competing at Grand Slams and reaching the Top 10. Now Royer is relishing the best results of his career. The former Top 10 junior won back-to-back Challenger titles last month in Rwanda and rode a 14-match winning streak to the Zadar Challenger final, during which Borna Coric ended the Frenchman’s hopes of a hat-trick. Valentin Royer celebrates his Kigali-1 title run with ballkids. Credit: Rwanda Challenger At a career-high No. 115 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Royer has reached at least the semi-finals in his past six outings. “Something that stands out, I would say, is the fact that I could break limits in my head,” Royer said. “After the first tournament, usually before I’d be in my head convincing myself, ‘Okay, I won one, let’s go back home and practise’. “When I was seeing guys like [Benjamin] Bonzi winning back-to-back-to-back tournaments [last October], I didn’t believe in myself enough to do those things. I really battled with myself and gave myself the best conditions to perform at the highest level.” That newfound belief has helped fuel Royer’s rise, strengthened by the lessons he has carried with him since a young age. “The fact that I have this work ethic in me, I’m not afraid of working hours and hours on court, this really brought out my inner me,” Royer said. “That’s important in the high level tennis where we are now.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "title": "#NextGenATP Engel on meeting idol Nadal \u0026 coach Kohlschreiber’s ‘biggest flex'",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/engel-munich-2025-feature",
    "description": "Few 17-year-old’s have enjoyed a six-month period quite like the one Justin Engel has just experienced. In October, the #NextGenATP German became the first player born in 2007 or later to win an ATP Tour match when he defeated Coleman Wong in Almaty. Since then, he has hired a former Top 20 player as his coach, met his tennis idol, and mixed it with one of German football’s most famous names. This week in Munich, Engel is preparing for another novel experience: His first tour-level event on home soil, the 2025 BMW Open by Bitpanda. “It's totally exciting. I mean, I'm almost at home here,” said Engel, who hails from Nuremburg, just 170km north of Munich. “A lot of people know me here in Munich, and I also train in the tennis base Oberhaching here, so I’m really excited to play here. “I was here [at the tournament] when I was eight or nine years old, and I watched [Gael] Monfils. It's really funny, now I'm here with him [at the same event]. It's really exciting to do this step in my career and let's see how it goes.” In Engel’s player box for his first-round match against Fabian Marozsan, which is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, will be coach Philipp Kohlschreiber. The former World No. 16 and eight-time ATP Tour champion joined the teenager’s team shortly after his historic win in Almaty. Kohlschreiber is a record three-time champion in Munich, a fact that Engel admits has come up in conversation. “Of course he talks about it. That is like his ‘biggest flex’,” joked the World No. 347. “It's really exciting to have this kind of player, now coach, in my team. Let's hope he can give me some tips on how to win some matches here.” Engel had to adjust to increased media attention, especially in his home country, after his historic victory against Wong. From an on-court perspective, however, the teenager says he learned as much from his second-round loss to Francisco Cerundolo in Kazakhstan as he did from his opening-round win. “After the first match, I knew I have the potential to really play at this level,” he said. “Also when I lost against Cerundolo, I saw, ‘Okay, it's really physical, a really mental game. They're really fast.’ So in the past couple of months, I trained my legs a lot and did everything fitness, so I also move towards this physical level that they play [on the ATP Tour].” Engel has enjoyed meetings with two sporting superstars since his run in Almaty. First, he met the manager of his hometown football club FC Nuremberg, Miroslav Klose, the former Germany striker who still holds the record for the most goals scored at FIFA World Cups. Then in early 2025, he travelled to Mallorca to train at the Rafa Nadal Academy by Movistar, where he met his tennis idol Rafael Nadal for the first time. “I was [at the academy] for the first time when I was like six or seven. I don't know, I don't remember,” said Engel. “But this was the first time I trained there and I also saw Rafa. He greeted me and we talked a little bit. I was really excited to see him. I had never even seen him before, only on the TV.” Before that meeting with former World No. 1 Nadal, Engel enjoyed an early on-court success for 2025 in January, when he won an ITF World Tennis Tour event in Cadolzburg, Germany. He is currently 25th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, but will rise to 11th if he defeats Marozsan on Tuesday, and he lists qualifying for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF as one of his biggest short-term goals. “I will try my best to play Next Gen this year,” said Engel of the 20-and-under season-ending event. “I saw on TV how special this event is. [The stadium] looks unbelievably good.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
