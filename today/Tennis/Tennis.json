    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/zverev-paris-2024-saturday-reaction",
    "description": "The grind never stops for Alexander Zverev. After securing a comprehensive semi-final victory over former champion Holger Rune at the Rolex Paris Masters Saturday, Zverev headed to the practice court, looking for incremental improvement that he hopes will allow him to challenge the duopoly at the top of the men's game. ‚ÄúFor me, it's about improving a few things. I feel like Jannik [Sinner] and Carlos [Alcaraz] are doing a few things better than me at the moment. I want to improve,‚Äù said Zverev. ‚ÄúI want to improve not for tomorrow, not for today, or because of the matches I played here. I want to generally improve for next year as well.‚Äù With his win over Rune, Zverev notched his 65th win of the year and tied Sinner for the most wins on Tour this season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He also overtook Alcaraz and climbed to the No. 2 spot in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. The German believes they are still at a higher level and that he needs to work hard to catch up. ‚ÄúIt's nice to be back at the highest position that I have been so far. Of course, I want to get higher. But for me, Jannik has [had] the best year this season, and Carlos had the second-best year. He won two Grand Slams,‚Äù he shared. ‚ÄúI know that I'm ahead of him in the rankings, but he won Wimbledon and Roland Garros. Those are two massive titles. So, they are still the two best players in the world, in my opinion, at the moment.‚Äù [ATP APP] The 27-year-old, who is set to compete at the Nitto ATP Finals, to be held from 10-17 November in Turin, is strategising to keep up with his two biggest rivals, and is focusing on increasing his intensity to match the level of aggression that they bring to their respective games. ‚ÄúI think when they get an easy ball, when they're in an attacking position, 90 per cent of the time the point is over, whether it's a winner or an unforced error. That's how hard they hit the ball, that's how aggressive they are. I think in that aspect I can improve. That's what I'm trying to do,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJannik has improved a lot this year. There are some things Carlos has improved. I think Novak, over the past 15, [or] 20 years, has improved every single year. If you ask him whether he's a better tennis player last year, let's say 2023 or 2022 even, or 10 years ago when he was younger, I think he would say that he's a better tennis player now.‚Äù After suffering a serious ankle injury at the 2022 Roland Garros and continuing to recover from it in 2023, the 27-year-old is pleased to return to his best level. Fresh off his maiden Grand Slam final at the 2020 US Open, Zverev had won six tour-level titles in 2021, including the Nitto ATP Finals, and was midway through one of the best Roland Garros semi-finals of the Open Era with Nadal with tragedy struck. ‚ÄúThere was a period where it was moving towards the direction of a little bit of a change, and then 2022 I felt like I was going [in] a very good direction at Roland Garros. I was going [to] hopefully to achieve my dream of winning Roland Garros. I was No. 2 in the world. I was very close to becoming World No. 1, as well. It was going in that direction, and then there was a two-year stop to that process. [For] two years I was not competitive for Grand Slams, not competitive for World No. 1 and those things,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo I'm happy to be back where I am. ‚ÄúThere was never a guarantee that I would be back at this level. For sure for me, it's a great satisfaction to be back, but again, I want to improve and I want to go even higher.‚Äù The German, chasing his seventh Masters 1000 title, will play Frenchman Ugo Humbert in his 12th Masters final in Paris on Sunday.

    "description": "Ugo Humbert is an ATP Masters 1000 finalist. The French star moved past Karen Khachanov 6-7(6), 6-4, 6-3 on home soil at the Rolex Paris Masters on Saturday to advance to his maiden final at Masters 1000 level. The 26-year-old played explosive tennis in front of an electric crowd in Paris and capitalised on Khachanov‚Äôs physical limitations in the closing stages of the third set to become the fifth Frenchman to reach the title match at the indoor hard event. \"It is amazing to do it in Paris at my favourite tournament. It is a dream,\" Humbert said. \"It was a little bit difficult compared to the previous matches. I felt a little more pressure and after the loss of the first set I tried to enjoy the moment and be with the crowd. I did very well and I am super proud.\" There‚Äôs no place like home ü´∂üè°@HumbertUgo is through to his FIRST-EVER Masters 1000 final! #RolexParisMasters | @RolexPMasters pic.twitter.com/vKGJDD1Rn8‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) November 2, 2024 Humbert crushed the ball off both wings and soaked in the roars from the crowd to earn his 13th consecutive win on indoor hard courts in France. The 15th seed won the title in Metz last year and then triumphed indoors in Marseille in February. Chasing his seventh tour-level title, Humbert will meet Alexander Zverev in the championship match on Sunday. Earlier this week, Humbert upset Carlos Alcaraz. The Frenchman, who hit 35 winners against Khachanov, is up four places to No. 14 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will rise to a career-high No. 11 on Monday if he wins the title. Khachanov was competitive until 3-2 in the third set, when he received a medical timeout for a leg injury. The No. 21 player in the PIF ATP Rankings lost serve in the seventh game of the third set and was unable to move in the final two games of the two-hour, 48-minute match. [ATP APP] Humbert is the first Frenchman to reach the final in Paris since Jo-Wilfried Tsonga lost to Roger Federer in the 2011 title match. The last Frenchman to win the crown was Tsonga in 2008. Humbert will aim to take his standout 6-1 record in finals into Sunday's meeting with Zverev. The lefty, who lost his first ATP Tour final in Tokyo last month to Arthur Fils, is level at 1-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Zverev. Earlier this year Humbert lifted trophies in Dubai and Marseille, while Zverev clinched the crown at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Rome. Khachanov is a former champion in Paris, having won the biggest title of his career in the French capital in 2018. The 28-year-old earned an impressive straight-sets win against Grigor Dimitrov in the quarter-finals but ran out of steam against Humbert. Khachanov finishes his year holding a 37-22 record, lifting trophies in Doha and Almaty. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
