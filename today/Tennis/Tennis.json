It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-reaction-barcelona-2025-final",
    "description": "Carlos Alcaraz left the court on Sunday at the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell with a mixture of emotions. He felt proud at having reached his second final in two weeks, and the first since his title in Monte Carlo. Alcaraz also experienced wonder at the level of his opponent, Holger Rune, and an even greater admiration for one of his biggest idols, Rafael Nadal, with whom he played doubles with at the Paris Olympics last year. The Spaniard fell at the final hurdle in his attempt to match his countryman Nadal, the last man to win Monte-Carlo and Barcelona in consecutive weeks (2018). One of the reasons for his defeat on Sunday was fatigue, which was evident in his second set against Rune, particularly when he asked for a medical timeout because of an issue with his right leg. “That’s what happens when you play so many matches and have so few days to rest. It’s so demanding, and you have to give 100 per cent every day. Having played a tournament like Monte-Carlo and arriving in Barcelona with few days to adapt is really tough. Now I bow at the feet of Rafa [Nadal] because of what he did week after week. You have to respect that,” said Alcaraz. “We admire Rafa for what he’s done, particularly on this swing. But winning everything consecutively is kind of impossible. And once you’ve experienced it firsthand, you appreciate what Rafa did much more and how difficult it is to be 100 per cent physically and mentally week after week.” For that reason and because of the impressive performance of his opponent in the final, Alcaraz takes a lot of positives away from his week in Barcelona. “Losing is never easy, even less so in a final here. But I have to give credit to Holger, he played an exceptional match, very well organised. He knew what he had to do at all times,” Alcaraz said of Rune, with whom he now shares a Lexus ATP Head2Head record of 2-2. “I’m not surprised by his level, but I am by his discipline. He didn’t have any ups and downs, he was very professional. From start to finish he was very clear on what he had to do and he went for it.” Alcaraz has the most wins on Tour in 2025 with 2024, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He added: “I left him off a few times and that hurt me at the end of the match. “But, in general, I played a final in Barcelona, and I’m leaving here proud to have given my all.” Although Alcaraz was not 100 per cent on the final day of the tournament, he hopes that he will reach that point for his opener in Madrid, where the main draw starts on Wednesday. “We’ll have two days off, which I would have had anyway if I hadn’t hurt myself,” the 21-year-old said. “I’ll talk with my team, we’ll do some tests, but I’m confident it won’t affect me in Madrid.” In his last tournament before turning 22, many are expecting to see a revitalised version of Alcaraz, including his fans and his idol Nadal, who contacted him after the final in Barcelona. “He wrote to me,” Alcaraz said. “To give me some encouragement, telling me he hopes that I’m not injured and that in a few days I can train again and give my all.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Alexander Zverev overtook Carlos Alcaraz for No. 2 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings on Sunday, but the battle for the position is just beginning. The German won the BMW Open by Bitpanda to give himself a five-point edge ahead of the Spaniard. Had Alcaraz defeated Holger Rune in the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell final, the Spaniard would have retained World No. 2. Instead, one week after taking it from Zverev, they have flipped places once more. That is something that could happen again multiple times in the coming weeks. PIF ATP Live Rankings  Player  Live Pts  '24 Madrid Pts  '24 Rome Pts  '24 RG Pts  No. 2 Alexander Zverev  8,045  100  1,000  1,300  No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz  8,040  200  0  2,000 Watch Munich final highlights: World No. 2 will be up for grabs again at the Mutua Madrid Open, the fourth ATP Masters 1000 event of the season. Zverev is defending 100 points in Madrid, and Alcaraz 200 points. Every match could prove pivotal. Although Alcaraz will defend 2,000 points at the end of the clay-court season at Roland Garros, Zverev is the player with more points set to drop from his rankings breakdown during the rest of this swing. Last year, the 27-year-old triumphed in Rome, where Alcaraz did not compete. Through the end of Roland Garros, Zverev is defending 2,400 points compared to 2,200 points for Alcaraz. Holger Rune climbed to No. 9 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings with his efforts in Barcelona, where he lifted his first trophy of the season. The Dane returns to the Top 10 Monday for the first time since the second week of April last year. He will be in good position to climb even higher in Madrid, since No. 8 Andrey Rublev is defending champion and will drop 1,000 points after the event.
