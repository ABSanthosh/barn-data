    "description": "American teen Learner Tien notched a major upset in the early hours of Friday morning, when he sunk three-time finalist Daniil Medvedev in a five-set thriller to seal his spot in the third round of the Australian Open. Runner-up at last month's Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in Jeddah, the 19-year-old qualifier dug deep for a 6-3, 7-6(4), 6-7(8), 1-6, 7-6(10-7) triumph over the fifth seed in four hours, 49 minutes, crossing the line at 2:55 a.m in Melbourne. Tien, the No. 121 in the PIF ATP Rankings, let slip a match point the third set, but crucially reeled off the last four points in the deciding-set tie-break to claim the biggest win of his career.¬† \"I was definitely hoping it wouldn't go to a fifth-set breaker, but I'm just happy to get a win,‚Äù said Tien. ‚ÄúI know I made it a lot harder than maybe it could have been... Losing the third was tough after playing for that long and having a match point. I didn't even get to touch the ball I don't think, it was an ace. So it was a little disappointing to see a fourth [set] after fighting back from a break down in the third. \"Honestly in the fourth set I just had to pee so bad, so I was trying to finish it up fairly quick. But I also wanted to start the fifth serving, so I scrapped that game at 0-5, and it all worked out.\" Nail-biting victory üèÜ Tien holds strong in a tight battle, outlasting Medvedev in a tiebreak thriller 6-3 7-6(4) 6(8)-7 1-6 7-6(7)@AustralianOpen #AusOpen pic.twitter.com/AZfG4hxFWM ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) January 16, 2025 Despite the gruelling nature of the battle with Medvedev, Tien managed to find an extra burst of energy in the final set, during which he struck 13 winners and converted each of the two break points he created, according to Infosys Stats. With his gutsy victory, the Californian became the second-youngest American man to reach the third round at the Australian Open after 18-year-old Pete Sampras in 1990. As he continues his debut in the main draw at the Australian major, Tien will next face Frenchman Corentin Moutet, who earlier rallied past another American qualifier Mitchell Krueger 4-6, 6-4, 7-6(3), 6-4. Tien‚Äôs consistent, methodical approach has often drawn parallels with that of Medvedev, and their maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash was destined to be nothing short of a tactical struggle. Yet it was the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented PIF runner-up who took the game to Medvedev, rallying back from a break down in each of the first two sets to spark hopes of an upset. Medvedev, bidding to reach the third round in Melbourne for a seventh consecutive year, squandered a break lead once more in the third set, but recovered in the tie-break, where he saved a match point on serve at 6/7 before racing clear in the fourth.¬† It appeared as if Medvedev was going to complete an epic comeback when he held two serves at 7/6 in the final set tie-break, but Tien came up with some inspired shot-making to secure his maiden win over a Top 5 opponent.¬† [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/shelton-australian-open-2025-thursday-reaction",
    "description": "Different game styles can be a key deciding factor in top-level tennis, and not just once a match is underway. Just ask Ben Shelton. The American was asked on Thursday about the advantages and disadvantages of competing as a lefty in his sport. Shelton did not need long to find a response. ‚ÄúYou can't get a practice [partner]. It's impossible, except for when the draw comes out and they play [Jack] Draper, Shapo [Denis Shapovalov], or Ugo Humbert,‚Äù said Shelton, referencing some his fellow lefties on the ATP Tour. ‚ÄúThen I get the look. Other than that, people don't want to practise with you as much. ‚ÄúFor me I don't mind. I hit with a righty, lefty, tall guy, short guy, serve bot, grinder. Doesn't really matter. Guys on tour, players or coaches, are particular about who they practise with. Big serve, lefty, that's two strikes against you. Finding hits can be difficult.‚Äù Any potential struggle for practice partners certainly did not impact Shelton on Thursday afternoon at Melbourne Park, where he downed Pablo Carreno Busta 6-3, 6-3, 6-7(4), 6-4 in the second round. Indeed, the American does not necessarily view a lack of time hitting with his ATP Tour rivals as all negative. ‚ÄúI'd say at the same time, people don't want to hit with lefties, so they don't see your style of game as much,‚Äù revealed the No. 20 in the PIF ATP Rankings. ‚ÄúI go out and play against somebody that said no to practising with me the last four times, at least he hasn't seen my serve. Pros and cons, for sure.‚Äù Shelton has now reached at least the third round on all three of his appearances at the Australian Open. A quarter-finalist on event debut in 2023, the 22-year-old will meet Lorenzo Musetti next after the Italian overcame another lefty, Shapovalov, 7-6(3), 7-6(6), 6-2. Full power üí•@BenShelton powers through to defeat Carreno Busta 6-3 6-3 6-7 6-4 üëä@AustralianOpen | #AusOpen pic.twitter.com/94RL3QK4hb‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) January 16, 2025 Musetti holds a 2-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead against Shelton after victories at Queen‚Äôs Club in 2023 and last year in Miami, respectively, but Shelton will not be concerned with the past ahead of the third-round clash. ‚ÄúHonestly, win or lose, I'm trying to learn something from the last match I played,‚Äù said the American, when asked whether head-to-head records bother him. ‚ÄúIf you won the match before, you know that the guy's going to try to do something different to flip the script. Obviously if you lost the match, you're the guy who's got to change something up. ‚ÄúI don't really mind either way. Obviously you want to look at things that worked when you played, look at things that didn't work that you want to change. I think also for me, being in a Grand Slam is a different game. I can't as much compare playing guys in two-out-of-three sets than three-out-of-five. It's a different beast. It's where I play my best tennis. That's not something that I look at as much.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
