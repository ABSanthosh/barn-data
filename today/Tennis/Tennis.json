Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Joao Fonseca maintained his flawless run at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF by edging Jakub Mensik across five tie-break sets on a dramatic Friday night in Jeddah. The Brazilian 18-year-old registered a hard-fought 3-4(4), 4-3(8), 4-3(5), 3-4(4), 4-3(5) victory over the third-seeded Czech in a match of fine margins. Fonseca held his nerve in five tight sets to clinch the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash and advance to the last four with a perfect 3-0 Blue Group record on his tournament debut. “Before the match, I had already qualified for the semi-finals. I will play tomorrow,” Fonseca said in his on-court interview. “I had already qualified, so, I think in tennis or any sport you need to think of today, not tomorrow.” Mensik showed glimpses of the solid play that defined his 2024 season. But it was a stronger showing from Fonseca, who withstood the challenge posed by the Czech’s booming deliveries with big serves and aggressive returns of his own. He won 73 per cent of his first-serve points, according to ATP Infosys Stats. Despite squandering two match points in the fifth set right before heading into the tie-break, he remained calm under pressure to seal the win in two hours and 11 minutes. [ATP APP] Fonseca, currently No. 145 in the PIF ATP Rankings, will play Luca Van Assche on Saturday for a place in the final. Van Assche finished runner-up in the Red Group after defeating Nishesh Basavareddy in a winner-take-all contest earlier on Friday. “I know Luca. He is a very solid guy. We are going to face each other for the first time. I am going to do my best and hope I can go for the win,” Fonseca said. Earlier this week, Fonseca dispatched top seed Arthur Fils and Learner Tien. The 18-year-old reached the quarter-finals in Rio de Janeiro in February and the last eight at the ATP 250 in Bucharest. He is the first Brazilian to compete at the 20-and-under event. Did you know? This is only the second time a Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF match has gone to five tie-breaks in event history after Dominic Stricker defeated Lorenzo Musetti in a group match in 2022.

    "title": "Preview: Friends Michelsen, Tien chase 'Victory Royale' in opening Jeddah SF",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/jeddah-2024-sf-preview",
    "description": "Alex Michelsen and Learner Tien might be inseparable off the court, but throw a competitive edge into the mix, like Fortnite battles and table tennis duels, and their friendship turns into a fiery rivalry. On court, even their head-to-head record is up for a funny debate. Tien insists he trails 1-2, but Michelsen includes doubles in the tally, confidently claiming a 4-1 advantage. The stakes will skyrocket in Saturday’s semi-finals at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, where Michelsen and Tien are set to clash in their first professional meeting. While Michelsen cruised to a perfect 3-0 record in Red Group, Tien survived a win-or-go-home test in his final Blue Group round-robin match to reach the last four. Michelsen was sitting in Tien’s player’s box for the entirety of that match, cheering his friend to victory. When Tien ousted World No. 20 Arthur Fils — the highest-ranked win of his career — Michelsen turned around and pointed at the back of his sweatshirt, which read ‘Victory Royale’ — a phrase used in the video game Fortnite when a player is the last one standing. It was a moment that perfectly described their friendship. “We play Fortnite a lot together, so it’s kind of a joke,” Tien said. “Our agent got us tracksuits that say that on the back. We both got different colours.” [2] Alex Michelsen (USA) vs [5] Learner Tien (USA) Only one of Michelsen or Tien will walk away with a ‘Victory Royale’ after they battle for a spot in the Jeddah championship match. The second-seeded Michelsen banished any remaining demons from his 0-3 campaign last year in Jeddah by going 3-0 in group play this time around. The No. 41 in the PIF ATP Rankings has racked up a 34-29 record this season, a tally which includes championship-match runs in Newport and Winston-Salem. Tien is also aiming to become the second Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion from the United States (after 2022 winner Brandon Nakashima). If the lefty can down Michelsen on Saturday, he will have upset the three highest-ranked players in the field after his group-stage triumphs against top seed Arthur Fils and third seed Jakub Mensik. [ATP APP] [6] Luca Van Assche (FRA) vs [8] Joao Fonseca (BRA) Adding your name to the record books amidst elite company such as Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz is a difficult task. Yet that is what 18-year-old Fonseca has done in Jeddah, becoming the second youngest semi-finalist in event history, only one month younger than 2019 champion Sinner. In his first round-robin match, the Brazilian downed World No. 20 Arthur Fils for the highest-ranked win of his career. Fonseca, who went on to win Blue Group, became the youngest man to score a Top 20 win since Alcaraz defeated then No. 14 David Goffin in 2021 (Melbourne-1). Sinner and Alcaraz are each former champions at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF and now Fonseca is two wins away from joining them in that right. Fonseca started the season at No. 730 in the PIF ATP Rankings and is currently No. 145 after a breakthrough year in which he reached two tour-level quarter-finals (Rio de Janeiro, Bucharest) and won his maiden ATP Challenger Tour title. Van Assche comes hungry, aiming to improve upon last year’s semi-final showing in Jeddah. The Frenchman, the fifth player to reach multiple semi-finals at the 20-and-under event, advanced in a win-or-go-home battle Friday against Nishesh Basavareddy. Van Assche, who finished second in Red Group, will again be faced with those same stakes in his first Lexus ATP Head2Head series meeting with Fonseca.“I know him because he is an unbelievable talent,” Van Assche told ATPTour.com when asked about facing Fonseca. “I practised with him four or five days ago here, also I think once before [elsewhere]. He’s a tough opponent for sure. His level is very high, but I know I can beat him. It will be a very good match, a tough one, but you practise to play these matches, so it will be cool.” The 20-year-old has played some of his best tennis under pressure this season. Van Assche reached the third round of the Australian Open thanks to back-to-back five set wins. In Jeddah, he has earned a pair of four-set wins — against Shang Juncheng and Basavareddy — to continue his pursuit of becoming the first Frenchman to win the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF.
