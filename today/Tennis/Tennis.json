    "description": "Could Novak Djokovic be rounding into form? The six-time Miami Open presented by Itau champion returned to the quarter-finals of the ATP Masters 1000 event with a 6-2, 6-2 win against 15th seed Lorenzo Musetti on Tuesday evening. The 37-year-old, who is now three victories from his 100th tour-level title, produced a statement performance in front of Serena Williams and Juan Martin del Potro (the Argentine was in his box). \"I was starstruck! It was amazing to see first DelPo, obviously a long-time friend and a rival, so happy to have him around and get his support from the box. It was amazing, it was [the] first time to have DelPo in the box, so I want to thank him really for coming,\" Djokovic said in his on-court interview. \"And Serena, that was a surprise. I didn't know. \"Actually, when I had that down-the-line passing shot, I pointed to her and asked her whether it was okay. She kind of said, 'Yeah, it was fine'. If Serena says it was fine, then it was amazing by everyone else's standards. So yeah, great to have them.\" Emphatic Novak üíé@DjokerNole continues his hunt for tour-level title 100, as he sweeps past Musetti and will face Korda in the quarter-finals! @MiamiOpen | #MiamiOpen pic.twitter.com/KtESKQPlHv ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) March 26, 2025 Djokovic fell behind an early break, and was given a time violation warning. That moment proved pivotal, as the 40-time Masters 1000 winner snapped into gear from there. The fourth seed won nine consecutive games to turn a deficit into a landslide, ultimately sealing his place in the last eight after one hour and 23 minutes. \"He had a really good start of the match. First couple games I started a little bit slow and then I knew that if I give him time, he's going to make his shots,\" Djokovic said. \"He loves kind of running around his backhand, hitting forehands. But he is so talented, he can play any shot in the game on any surface. \"It was tough, particularly in the first seven, eight games of the match. But I think breaking his serve to come back to 2-all and break right away at 3-2, it was a momentum shift and I tried to use that.\" The Serbian brought rock-solid play to Hard Rock Stadium and relentlessly pursued his opponent‚Äôs serve, earning 12 break points and converting five of them, according to Infosys ATP Stats. ¬† Musetti sarcastically raised his arms to celebrate snapping Djokovic's streak of nine straight games, but it was not enough to turn the tide. The winner now leads the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series 8-1. Next up for the former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings will be American Sebastian Korda, who clawed past Gael Monfils 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 earlier in the day. In their only previous clash two years ago in the Adelaide final, Djokovic saved championship point en route to the title. It was a tricky clash for the home favourite against a fans' favourite in Monfils. Korda let slip a lead and play was suspended due to rain when he was up a break in the third set. But the 23-year-old held firm and closed out the match upon resumption without trouble. \"I think I got pretty negative as well. I was thinking about a couple points versus the match overall,\" Korda said. \"Just got negative about the little things instead of saying overall that everything was going pretty well. Just kind of had to refocus, be positive again and keep trying my best.\" One day after Alex de Minaur won a three-set thriller against #NextGenATP sensation Joao Fonseca, the Aussie was on the losing end of another tight match. Matteo Berrettini ousted the 10th seed 6-3, 7-6(7). The end of the second set featured a rollercoaster of momentum shifts. After failing to serve out the match at 6-5 ‚Äî a game during which he had three match points ‚Äî Berrettini was close to needing a deciding set. De Minaur was unable to convert one of three consecutive set points from 6/3 in the tie-break, allowing the Italian to emerge victorious after two hours and one minute. Did You Know? This is Djokovic‚Äôs first appearance in Miami since 2019. He had not advanced to the quarter-finals since winning the title at Crandon Park in 2016. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Francisco Cerundolo cooly served some South Florida revenge on Tuesday afternoon at the Miami Open presented by Itau. The Argentine upset fifth seed Casper Ruud 6-4, 6-2 to reach his third quarter-final in four appearances at the hard-court ATP Masters 1000. Cerundolo‚Äôs 87-minute triumph was against the same opponent who ended his breakout 2022 Miami run at the semi-final stage. ‚ÄúI like the city. I like Miami. I always found it good since the first time I came here,‚Äù said Cerundolo. ‚ÄúA lot of Argentinian fans and Latin Americans. I spend a lot of good-quality time outside the court and that is probably something that inspires me to play well.‚Äù After letting slip three break points from 0/40 in the opening game against Ruud, Cerundolo eventually made his breakthrough on return at 3-3. He converted his fourth break point of that game and held firm on serve to take the opening set, before racing to victory in style in the second. The only thing that delayed the 23rd seed‚Äôs victory was a three-hour, 30-minute rain delay that arrived at 5-1 in the second set. Beast mode: ACTIVATED üöÄ @MiamiOpen | #MiamiOpen | @FranCerundolo pic.twitter.com/dI1GlgUTzB‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) March 25, 2025 By reaching back-to-back Masters 1000 quarter-finals at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells and now in Miami, Cerundolo became the first Argentine to reach the last eight at both ‚ÄòSunshine Double‚Äô events in the same year since Juan Martin del Potro in 2018. Now 16-6 for the 2025 season, the 26-year-old leads Ruud 5-3 in the pair‚Äôs Lexus ATP Head2Head series. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm super happy. It‚Äôs always difficult when you‚Äôre playing a really good match, controlling the game, and you have to stop for rain,‚Äù said Cerundolo. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not easy, but I was chill and came back to the match confident and played a really good service game. I‚Äôm super happy to get back-to-back Masters 1000 quarter-finals in the U.S., on hard courts. It‚Äôs a great achievement.‚Äù Awaiting Cerundolo in the quarter-finals will be 14th seed Grigor Dimitrov, who kicked off the Tuesday schedule in Miami by defeating Brandon Nakashima 6-4. 7-5 on Grandstand. Dimitrov expertly targeted his opponent‚Äôs second serve to clinch his fourth-round win. Nakashima dropped just three points behind his first delivery in the match, according to Infosys ATP Stats, but Dimitrov won 61 per cent (11/18) on second-serve return and converted two of five break points he earned. The 2024 finalist Dimitrov would have exited the Top 20 after Miami had he lost to Nakashima. Instead, he is into his second quarter-final in South Florida, which he will contest as the No. 20 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
