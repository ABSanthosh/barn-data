    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/diallo-almaty-2024-feature",
    "description": "Gabriel Diallo won‚Äôt soon forget this week‚Äôs Almaty Open and it‚Äôs not only because of what the Canadian has done on court. Yes, Diallo reached a maiden ATP Tour quarter-final and now semi-final to move closer to the sought after Top 100 in the PIF ATP Rankings benchmark. But the newly turned 23-year-old also got to meet an older family member on his mom‚Äôs side for the first time. ‚ÄúHere I met my cousin that I never met in my life before,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMy cousin lives here in Almaty and has been coming to my matches, so it‚Äôs pretty special. And I think it‚Äôs something that helped me throughout the week.‚Äù Diallo even intends to do some sightseeing with his cousin after his last match. That could still be a couple of days away, since the 6-foot-8 big server beat Alejandro Tabilo 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 amid Almaty‚Äôs high altitude on Friday to land in the last four. A hip injury affected the Montrealer earlier in the year to halt the momentum garnered from the end of 2023. But the former University of Kentucky standout said that winning the Chicago Challenger in late July without dropping a set proved pivotal in his upturn. In all matches since that Challenger began, Diallo sports a 27-7 record. Having been as high as No. 103 in the rankings in September after a third round showing as a qualifier at the US Open, Diallo‚Äôs live ranking eclipsed the Top 100 immediately following victory against the Canadian-born Tabilo. ‚ÄúWould be nice to keep going, keep climbing the rankings but we keep a big focus on the process for sure,‚Äù said Diallo. [ATP APP] It was a measured reply from the well-spoken Diallo yet he admits that he does spend his share of time glancing at the rankings. ‚ÄúI do, especially after last week. I had to defend points and I managed to defend a big chunk,‚Äù said Diallo, who won the Bratislava Challenger 12 months ago. ‚ÄúSo I knew I was getting there. Before starting in Almaty I was 118, now I‚Äôm just inside (the Top 100) but there are guys behind me that are hungry, playing just as well, that are trying to make a move as well. So I got to keep focusing and doing my part.‚Äù In his still young ATP main-draw career, Diallo achieved another personal best Friday by tallying 70 per cent of his second-serve points against the second seed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good for sure because you don‚Äôt want to be one dimensional to the point that if you don‚Äôt make your first serve, you know you are in big trouble,‚Äù he said. He is the type of player that likes to celebrate career milestones without going overboard when his tournament wraps up. That might mean eating a little cake, having one beer, a glass of wine or when he is at home, enjoying poutine. What he has accomplished in Almaty no doubt merits a treat, even if Diallo loses Saturday versus fourth-seed Francisco Cerundolo. The tournament hotel might be the starting point. ‚ÄúThe view is insane from the hotel,‚Äù said Diallo. ‚ÄúWe got the mountains.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Hugo Gaston produced more than just a box of tricks on Friday at the European Open in Antwerp. The Frenchman dug deep to overcome one of the ATP Tour‚Äôs most renowned battlers, Alex de Minaur, and reach the semi-finals at the ATP 250. Gaston did not earn a break point between the fourth game of the opening set and the final game of the match, but he found a late charge on return to seal a 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 victory. First Top 10 win! üëè Gaston fights past de Minaur 6-3 3-3 7-5 to reach the SF in Antwerp!@EuroTennisOpen | #EuropeanOpen pic.twitter.com/aOYdwgyUxO ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) October 18, 2024 ‚ÄúIt was really close. Alex is such a great player, playing unbelievable tennis this year and in the past few years,‚Äù said Gaston after notching his first win in five attempts against an opponent from the Top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings. ‚ÄúWhen you play against Alex, you have to be ready to play a lot of rallies. I have a little bit of pain in my body, but I tried to stay focused on the game and on my shots, and it was a good one today.‚Äù Although his ability to go toe-to-toe with De Minaur in extended rallies was the key to his quarter-final win, Gaston nonetheless found time to sprinkle some of his trademark creative magic on Friday‚Äôs encounter. The best example of that came in the sixth game of the match, when he produced an outrageous no-look overhead from behind the baseline. Gaston won 85 per cent (17/20) of points at the net against De Minaur, according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to reaching his third ATP Tour semi-final. He now leads the Australian 2-0 in the pair‚Äôs Lexus ATP Head2Head series, after he also prevailed in the pair's clash at Roland Garros in 2022. Standing in Gaston‚Äôs way of a spot in his third tour-level championship match will be Roberto Bautista Agut. The Spaniard earlier upset third seed Felix Auger-Aliassime 3-6, 6-2, 7-6(6) to reach his first ATP Tour semi-final since June 2023. Quarter-final defeat in his first tournament since the US Open was a blow to De Minaur‚Äôs hopes of qualifying for the Nitto ATP Finals for the first time. The 25-year-old is ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, 275 points behind eighth-placed Andrey Rublev. ¬† After de Minaur‚Äôs exit, second seed Stefanos Tsitsipas was stunned by Jiri Lehecka, who cruised to a 6-4, 6-4 win against the Greek on Friday. Playing his 14th tour-level quarter-final, Lehecka hit 19 winners, including eight aces. He did not face a break point in the one-hour 24-minute match. The Czech broke Tsitsipas to go up 4-3 in the first set, claimed an immediate break in the second set, and did not relinquish his lead from there on. With a second win over Tsitsipas this year, Lehecka leveled the pair‚Äôs Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 2-2. The loss was a setback to the 26-year-old‚Äôs hopes of qualifying for the Nitto ATP Finals. He is currently 11th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. The fifth-seeded Lehecka will play Marcos Giron or Zizou Bergs in his sixth tour-level semi-final on Saturday. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
