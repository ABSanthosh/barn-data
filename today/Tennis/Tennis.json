    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/djokovic-reaction-miami-2025-friday",
    "description": "Novak Djokovic set out with a point to prove on Friday at the Miami Open presented by Itau, where the six-time champion marked his first appearance since 2019 with a resounding victory. Having been forced to retire from his Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev in January, and suffering opening-round defeats in Doha and Indian Wells, Djokovic entered Miami on a three-match losing streak. Yet the fourth seed delivered a clinical display to see off Rinky Hijikata 6-0, 7-6(1) and spark hopes of a turn in form. “I wanted to make a statement to myself and to others that I'm still able to play at a high level,” said Djokovic. “I lost two tournaments in the first rounds, so I really was eager to get the win in the first match in Miami. “[I played] perfect tennis for a set and a half. I think he had stepped it up in the second set, deservedly took it to a tie-break, and then I played a great tie-break. All in all, there is always something you can work on, but for me it's just about maintaining this level of tennis and trying to be even better if I can as the tournament progresses.” With his second consecutive Lexus ATP Head2Head victory over Hijikata, Djokovic equalled 22-time major winner Rafael Nadal for the most ATP Masters 1000 wins (410) since the series’ introduction in 1990. But there are further feats that the 37-year-old would relish achieving in Florida this fortnight. Djokovic is bidding to record his 100th tour-level trophy, which would cement himself as the third man to hit a century, after Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103). If he were to claim a seventh title in Miami, he would also move clear of Andre Agassi (6) as the most successful player in the tournament’s history. “Miami, for sure. I'd love to celebrate the 100th win here,” said Djokovic when asked of his preferred destination to hit the century mark. “But let’s see, it's a long tournament. Of course it encourages me knowing that I can play the way I played today, but it's a long ride. “Hopefully I can do well and I can get myself in a good position in the finals to fight for a trophy. That would be amazing.” In 2023, Djokovic came within one match of completing the Grand Slam, losing only to Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final. He finished the year with seven titles (his biggest haul since seven in 2016) and by winning his seventh Nitto ATP Finals and capturing ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours for a record-extending eighth time. But in 2024 his lone title came at the Paris Olympics and he has remained agonisingly on 99 career titles since. After an error-strewn performance in his Indian Wells opener, in which he struck 37 unforced errors to fall to Botic van de Zandschulp, Djokovic appears to have refound his rhythm. The Serbian used his early exit to good effect as he fine tuned his preparations ahead of another record-chasing fortnight. “I had two weeks since the last match that I played in Indian Wells, so I had plenty of time to work on my game,” said Djokovic, who saved each of the two break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, against Hijikata. “I think that has positively reflected on my game today, particularly for set and a half, almost flawless tennis. I'm very pleased with the way I felt and played on the court.” The former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings will continue his quest for a first trophy since July last year against lucky loser Camilo Ugo Carabelli in the third round on Sunday.

    "description": "Novak Djokovic tied Rafael Nadal for the most ATP Masters 1000 match wins on Friday with an emphatic return to the Miami Open presented by Itau. The six-time champion produced a rock-solid performance to ease past Australia’s Rinky Hijikata 6-0, 7-6(1) and snap his three-match losing streak. Djokovic, who owns the most titles (40), finals (59) and semi-finals (78) at Masters 1000 level has now equalled Nadal for most match wins (410) since the series’ introduction in 1990. “I was playing really well, at a very high level from the beginning,” said Djokovic, who improved to 45-7 in Miami. “I knew exactly what I wanted to do tactically. I played him in the first match of the season in Brisbane. So I think it was good to do some homework, look at those videos.” ATP Masters 1000 Win Leaders  Player  W-L  Titles  Novak Djokovic  410-91  40  Rafael Nadal  410-90  36  Roger Federer   381-108  28  Andy Murray  230-101  14  Andre Agassi  209-73  17 The 99-time tour-level titlist Djokovic is this week bidding to move clear of Andre Agassi (6) for the most titles in Miami tournament history. In the third round, the Serbian will face lucky loser Camilo Ugo Carabelli, who rallied past fast-rising American Alex Michelsen 6-7(3), 7-5, 6-3. Djokovic’s return to Miami for the first time since 2019 marked his record 501st match at Masters 1000 level. The 37-year-old was entering the tournament on his first three-match losing streak since 2018 after defeats at the Australian Open (retirement), in Doha and Indian Wells, but bounced back well on Friday in Miami. Djokovic looked considerably transformed from the player who hit 37 unforced errors en route to his first-round loss to Botic van de Zandschulp in Indian Wells, striking just three in his 27-minute opener against Hijikata. “I know that the stats and the metrics have not been that great for me post Australia,” added Djokovic. “Obviously it took me a little bit more time after an injury to really find that groove, find that movement, that rhythm, that striking zone. I love the way I was practising actually the last seven to 10 days and had some great, great sessions on this court as well. “I'm obviously excited to compete to keep on playing at the highest level when I play this way. Obviously it's always a pleasure when you come back to an amazing city like Miami after six years of absence and I've had this many people in the first match, so I'm really, really grateful for their support.” While Hijikata found his range in the second set, highlighted by an epic scramble in the tie-break to hit a winner past Djokovic, the former World No. 1 reacted in clinical style. Djokovic reeled off the following six points to seal an 80-minute win and improve to 2-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The No. 86 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Hijikata was aiming to score the biggest win of his career, but was unable to convert either of the two break points he created in the match, according to Infosys ATP Stats.
