It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "title": "The memory of Crandon Park that inspired 'Fran' Cerundolo’s journey to the Tour",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/cerundolo-feature-miami-2025",
    "description": "Francisco Cerundolo’s history at the Miami Open presented by Itau, one of the most significant events of his career on the ATP Tour, began when the Argentine first set foot in the venue when it was still played at Crandon Park. ‘Fran’, who was just 15 years old, posed for a photo on the Centre Court, perhaps unaware of the tournament’s place in the history of tennis, and having never even dreamed of returning one day as a participant in the event. “That trip was the first time I visited the USA. We came with my aunt and uncle, my cousins, my mum and my siblings. We went to Disney World on holiday, and then mum took us to Crandon Park. We took a photo there. My parents played tennis and we knew it was an amazing place,” remembered Cerundolo in an interview with ATPTour.com. “What we didn’t know was that in the future I’d be playing in the tournament. I was playing then, but let’s say I wasn’t great. There were a lot of people who played so much better than me at that time. That’s why I didn’t think it was possible. Even though I used to watch a lot of matches on TV, it wasn’t part of my plans.” At the time, they were simply happy to have visited somewhere that was on TV. His mother, María Luz, also has vivid memories of that day. “There was nobody there, and that meant we could go out on court, walk on it and imagine the best tennis players in the world and the grandstands full of people. What we never imagined was that one day Fran would be one of those stars.” Possibly, Cerundolo himself reaffirmed the belief that he did not belong in that world sometime later, when he returned to Miami to play in the Orange Bowl. While his brother claimed the under-12 title, Fran lost in the qualifiers for the under-16 event. “The one who went there with a chance was Juan Manuel. And Fran went for an experience. He was more normal,” remembers Alejandro Cerundolo, their father and first coach, a professional player himself in the eighties. “In that tournament [Frances] Tiafoe, who is from the same generation as Fran, won the under-18 boys tournament. So imagine the change Fran went through in the next seven years. His rise from there was incredible.” As Cerundolo grew up, he became increasingly confident. He went to play university tennis for a time, and gave himself another chance at turning pro. At that juncture, the photo from Crandon Park started to become an inspiration for him again. A reminder that he could do it. [ATP APP] “As the years went by, I started to believe and when I saw that photo I used to say: ‘I hope one day I can play there,” added the three-time tour champion. The dream came true. Although the venue had by then changed, in 2022 he played in the Miami Masters 1000. Moreover, that very tournament he reached the semi-finals, seeing off along the way Tiafoe, the very player who had made him think about how far he was from being a professional almost a decade earlier at the Orange Bowl. “His is a story of hard work, and he deserves everything that has happened to him because of everything he’s been through. He’s achieved so many dreams and I think that’s surprising,” added Alejandro. Miami not only became the place where so many of his biggest dreams became a reality, it also became an inspiration for new dreams. “I’ve been here on holiday, at the Orange Bowl Juanma won, and many times practising when I had free weeks between Cincinnati and the US Open. I have a lot of Latino and, above all, Argentine friends here. Also, this is my fourth year playing the tournament. It’s an amazing combination,” explained Francisco, the current No. 24 in the PIF ATP Rankings. His latest foray in Miami started on Friday with a win over Frenchman Alexandre Muller, and will continue on Sunday against American 12th seed Tommy Paul. “Hopefully I can have a great tournament. It’s a tough draw, but if I can play good tennis, I’ll have chances.” As long as he’s in Miami, his chances will always be high. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/fonseca-humbert-miami-2025-saturday",
    "description": "Joao Fonseca further outlined his credentials as one of the Tour’s brightest prospects on Saturday at the Miami Open presented by Itau. The 18-year-old Brazilian delivered a five-star display to defeat 19th seed Ugo Humbert 6-4, 6-3 and reach the third round at an ATP Masters 1000 for the first time in his fledgling career. Fonseca is the youngest player to achieve that feat since Carlos Alcaraz in Paris in 2021. Born for the biggest stages 🏟️🦸‍♂️ Joao Fonseca becomes the youngest man to reach an ATP Masters 1000 third round since Carlos Alcaraz, 18, at Paris 2021! @MiamiOpen | #MiamiOpen pic.twitter.com/jHG94Mhbwn — ATP Tour (@atptour) March 22, 2025 Due to a last-minute schedule change, Fonseca and Humbert's second-round clash was relocated from Grandstand to Stadium. Although the Brazilian fans arrived gradually, filling the stands by the middle of the opening set, they quickly created a lively atmosphere as Fonseca surged to victory. “When the crowd is with any player, they are more hyped,” said Fonseca. “I started the match today super relaxed, with no nerves. That was good, I served well. I had a quick break, he was maybe a little bit more nervous in the beginning, but I started well and that’s what made the difference. “Against lefties, they like the crosscourts with their forehand. My backhand today was pretty good and I had the chance to play more aggressively with my forehand. I didn’t let him have opportunities on my serve [either].”   Fonseca broke Humbert's serve to love in the opening game and did not look back en route to a 71-minute victory, in which he did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats. In stark contrast to his opener against fellow #NextGenATP star Learner Tien, in which he suffered physically in the latter stages, Fonseca showed no signs of discomfort in a free-hitting performance. He dropped just four points on his serve throughout his encounter with Humbert, improving to 3-2 vs. Top-20 players and levelling his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with the Frenchman at 1-1. Fonseca has enjoyed a rapid rise at the start of the 2025 season. The reigning Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion claimed his maiden tour-level title in Buenos Aires in February and is now up to a new career-high No. 58 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. In the third round in Miami, Fonseca will face Alex de Minaur or Buyunchaokete. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
