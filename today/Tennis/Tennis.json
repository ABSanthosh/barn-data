Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Novak Djokovic and Jannik Sinner shared a brief embrace Tuesday at Wimbledon while crossing paths on the Aorangi Park practice courts. Many stars are arriving early at the All England Club to prepare for the season’s third major, which begins Monday, 30 June. Sinner practised with Grigor Dimitrov on Tuesday while Djokovic hit with Stefanos Tsitsipas, who is now coached by the Serbian’s former coach Goran Ivanisevic. Djokovic recently clashed against Sinner in a semi-final showing at Roland Garros, where the Italian advanced in straight sets. Sinner, No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, now leads Djokovic 5-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Could their 10th tour-level meeting come at Wimbledon? Scroll down to view photos from Tuesday’s practice sessions. All photo credits belong to Dan Istitene/Getty Images. Jannik Sinner will be the top seed at Wimbledon. Lorenzo Musetti, a semi-finalist last year at SW19, practises on Tuesday. Grigor Dimitrov will be making his 15th appearance at Wimbledon, where he reached the semi-finals in 2014. Novak Djokovic cracks a laugh during his practice session. Goran Ivanisevic, 2001 Wimbledon champion, is now coaching Stefanos Tsitsipas, a partnership that began this month.

    "description": "Novak Djokovic and Goran Ivanisevic shared a warm reunion Tuesday at Wimbledon. The Serbian — who previously worked with Ivanisevic for six years — was on court practising with Stefanos Tsitsipas, the 2001 Wimbledon champion's newest charge. Djokovic and Tsitsipas were among the stars hitting at Aorangi Park, continuing their preparation for the grass-court major. The 38-year-old Djokovic was coached by Ivanisevic from 2018 until March 2024, working alongside Marian Vajda during the first four years of that span. Tsitsipas, No. 26 in the PIF ATP Rankings, is aiming to regain his best form. He confirmed in May that he would begin working with the former No. 2 Ivanisevic, who was in Halle with the 26-year-old last week. Tsitsipas will look to improve upon his career-best fourth-round appearance (2018, 2023) at Wimbledon, where last year he reached the second round.

A 100-time tour-level titlist, Djokovic will be making his 20th consecutive appearance at the All England Club (tournament not held in 2020). The 24-time major champion boasts a 97-12 match record at SW19, where he last lifted the trophy in 2022. The past two years Djokovic has fallen to Carlos Alcaraz in the championship match. Both Djokovic and Tsitsipas will learn their place in the draw during the draw ceremony, which will be held on Friday, 27 June at 10 a.m. local time. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
