It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Zizou Bergs and Gabriel Diallo will each have a second shot at ATP Tour glory Sunday at the Libema Open. Both players notched impressive semi-final wins Saturday at the grass ATP 250 after rain had delayed play into the evening in ‘s-Hertogenbosch. Bergs blunted the big-serving threat of Reilly Opelka for a 6-1, 6-4 triumph, while Diallo upset second seed Ugo Humbert 6-3, 7-6(4). Sunday’s championship match will be a second ATP Tour final for both Bergs and Diallo, respectively. Bergs reached the final in Auckland, where he fell to Gael Monfils, in the first week of the 2025 season. Diallo lost to Karen Khachanov in the Almaty title match last October. Bergs booked his final spot by dominating the 6’11” Opelka from the start of their last-four clash in the Netherlands. The Belgian converted three of seven break points he earned against the American’s renowned serve, while he did not face a single break point on his own delivery according to Infosys ATP Stats. “There is not much to do against Reilly except keep the pressure high, make sure you return those serves and somehow I saw the ball really big today, like a balloon,” said Bergs in his on-court interview. “So I could anticipate really well receiving those bombs and putting something towards them. I served well, returned well, managed the match well, so I’m really happy.” Bergs has risen 14 spots to No. 49 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings as a result of his run in ‘s-Hertogenbosch so far. If he can defeat Diallo in the final, the 26-year-old will on Monday rise to a career-high No. 47 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Downing Diallo will be no easy task, however, as he demonstrated in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with World No. 20 Humbert. The Canadian deployed his big serve to great effect in his one-hour, 45-minute semi-final win, during which he won 83 per cent (35/42) of points behind his first delivery. Diallo, who had already guaranteed his Top 50 debut on Monday by reaching the semi-finals, is now up nine spots to No. 46 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. The 23-year-old is the first Canadian men’s singles finalist in ‘s-Hertogenbosch event history. Sunday’s showpiece on the Dutch grass will be Bergs and Diallo’s second Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. Diallo triumphed in the pair’s previous tour-level clash earlier this year on clay in Madrid. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Matthew Ebden and Jordan Thompson’s fledgling partnership took little time to settle this week at the Libema Open. On Saturday, the all-Australian pair downed Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool 6-4, 3-6, 10-7 to clinch the ‘s-Hertogenbosch ATP 250 title in their first ATP Tour event together. The third-seeded Ebden and Thompson, whose only previous tour-level match as a pair was a victory against Tommy Paul and Ben Shelton in the 2024 Davis Cup quarter-finals, won five of the final six points to prevail against Cash and Glasspool. Ebden and Thompson won 79 per cent (27/34) of points behind first serves, according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to a 74-minute victory in the Netherlands. It was Thompson’s eighth tour-level doubles crown, while it was a 13th for Ebden and his first since he won gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics alongside John Peers. “It was a great week,” reflected Thompson, the No. 10 in the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings. “For me, I had a tough one in singles. Second round, and I lost two match points, but it was a great opportunity for me to get back out on the doubles court. Playing with Matt, we gel well together. We play Davis Cup together, so it’s enjoyable to play with each other. Hopefully it’s building for next week at Queen’s.” Ebden added: “It’s awesome. Especially playing out there with a fellow Aussie, we’ve shared a lot together over the years, and in Davis Cup particularly. To bring that on the Tour and make a great start here with a title, we couldn’t ask for more.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
