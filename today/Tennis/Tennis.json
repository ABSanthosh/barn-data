It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "title": "What amazed Van de Zandschulp about Djokovic in their first meering",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/van-de-zandschulp-indian-wells-2025-feature",
    "description": "In 2022, Botic van de Zandschulp played Novak Djokovic for the first time in Astana. It was a memorable match, but not to the Dutchman's delight.  Djokovic triumphed 6-3, 6-1 en route to the title, while van de Zandschulp was left to figure out how he had played well and failed to challenge the Serbian superstar. “I remember I played pretty well, but I only got four games,” van de Zandschulp said. “So hopefully, that's going to be different in a couple days.” The 29-year-old will have his chance at revenge on Saturday at the BNP Paribas Open, where he will face Djokovic for the second time in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. “Everything I did, he had an answer for it. So, if I serve well, 220, returning it back, unbelievable return. If we're forehand cross, then he played a better shot in the end,” van de Zandschulp said of their first meeting. “I also looked at the stats after the first set — 12 winners, six unforced errors and lost the set 6-3. Normally, if you play 12 winners and six unforced errors, most of the time you win the set. That's something that amazed me.” Today the experience reminds the Dutchman of a match he played against Daniil Medvedev at the 2022 Australian Open, which Medvedev won 6-4, 6-4, 6-2. “I was playing good. I was playing amazing, but 4-6 4-6 down,” van de Zandschulp said. “I had maybe 25 winners and 10 unforced errors. All the stats were positive, and you're 4-6 4-6 down. That’s something I also had against Novak. When I played him back then, that was probably the most impressive when I played someone.” The two-time ATP Tour finalist has risen to the occasion before. Just last year at the US Open, van de Zandschulp swept Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets in the second round. “Those guys challenge me. I know I have to play my best. I have to play a certain way. Otherwise, they are going to do it. So that's something I know before I go into the match,” van de Zandschulp said. “I have to play that way, otherwise they're going to play like that, and then it's going to be really tough. Because if you say to Alcaraz, ‘Here you have it, you can decide the whole match, what's going to happen’, then it's going to be a really tough matchup.” Off the court, it has been an interesting time for the Dutchman. He bought his first house back home and has remotely been trying to get everything set up. “It's been tough with the time difference it's tough to manage. It is in Amsterdam,” van de Zandschulp said. “I got it in December. Someone is helping me, luckily. But still, you have to take care of a lot of stuff yourself. So that's sometimes it is not easy with the time differences.” For now, the No. 85 player in the PIF ATP Rankings' full focus is on Indian Wells. Van de Zandschulp lost in the final round of qualifying to Matteo Gigante. But Facundo Diaz Acosta withdrew due to a left foot injury, giving van de Zandschulp a lucky loser spot. Now he has a chance to cause a big upset against five-time champion Djokovic. “There’s something funny about that. You can be out and a couple hours later, you can be in. That's something you maybe have to take a little bit advantage of,” van de Zandschulp said. “Maybe you go a little bit different into the matches like you have nothing to lose, already lost in quality. You go out there and swing and see what happens. I think that's the attitude you have to have.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Lucky loser Botic van de Zandschulp scored a major upset on Saturday when he stunned five-time champion Novak Djokovic 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 at BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells. The No. 85 in the PIF ATP Rankings capitalised on an uncharacteristically error-strewn opening set from Djokovic before conjuring some inspired shot-making prowess in the deciding set to prevail in two hours, one minute. By securing his eighth victory over a Top 10 opponent, Van de Zandschulp notched back-to-back wins on the ATP Tour for the first time in 2025. “I think I kept my cool during the whole match,” said Van de Zandschulp. “The second set was very tough, he gained a big lead. But I think I did well turning it to 5-3 to get the momentum back a little bit. I think I started well, surviving one or two games in the third set, and then broke and turned it around. I know if I go into the match and lose my cool, especially against the big players, it’s going to be a really tough day. That’s always one thing I’m trying to do well.” Djokovic, who owns the record for most titles (40), finals (59) and semi-finals (78) at ATP Masters 1000 level, was aiming to tie Rafael Nadal for most wins (410). Yet the 37-year-old was unable to maintain the momentum shift as Van de Zandschulp levelled their Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 1-1.

Van de Zandschulp, however, came back with venom, outlasting the 24-time major winner from the baseline with ease and coming up clutch when at the net. More to follow… [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
