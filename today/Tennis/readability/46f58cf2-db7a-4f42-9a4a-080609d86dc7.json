  "text": "Britain's Cameron Norrie will contest his first ATP final since February 2023 as his fine end to the season continued with a straight-set win against Corentin Moutet at the Moselle Open.Norrie, who has only recently returned from missing two months with a forearm injury, earned a 6-2 7-6 (7-5) semi-final victory over the Frenchman in Metz.The season started strongly for Norrie with runs to the Australian Open last 16 and the Rio Open semi-finals, before he lost form and fitness over the second half of the year.The 29-year-old left-hander has dropped to 57th in the world rankings but, instead of allowing the season to peter out, he has worked hard to return and rediscovered his mojo in the final tournament of his season.\"It's not really a relief [to reach the final], but it has been a difficult year for me and I've not been able to gain any momentum,\" said Norrie, who will climb back into the world's top 50 next week.Against Moutet he served strongly and was clinical on his opportunities, taking four out of five break points.After losing a second-set tie-break from a commanding position in Thursday's quarter-final against Zizou Bergs, Norrie did the opposite against Moutet on Friday.Norrie trailed 5-2 in the tie-break but fought back to secure victory in straight sets.The joy of reaching the final, and in the manner he did it, was shown by Norrie baring his teeth and shouting his pleasure towards his team.On Saturday, he will face France's Benjamin Bonzi or Alex Michelsen of the United States for the trophy.It will be the 15th ATP Tour final of Norrie's career and the first since he beat Spanish world number three Carlos Alcaraz in the Rio final in February 2023.\"It's nice to finish the year by playing in another final and back to competing for every point,\" added Norrie.\"Regardless of who I play it will be difficult, but I'll enjoy the win today.\"",
