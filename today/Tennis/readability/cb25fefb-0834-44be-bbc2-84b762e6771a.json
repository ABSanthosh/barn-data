Monday’s matches featured strong performances from top seeds like Alexander Zverev and Taylor Fritz, alongside a gritty comeback from Alex de Minaur against a lively crowd favourite, Joao Fonseca. Below is how the day unfolded, who’s moving on in Miami, and select highlights of the key clashes shaping the draw.  Day Six 2025 Miami Open Round of 32 Results Winner Loser Scoreline Alexander Zverev (1) Jordan Thompson 7-5 6-4 Arthur Fils (17) Frances Tiafoe (16) 7-6(11) 5-7 6-2 Tomas Machac (20) Reilly Opelka (PR) 7-6(1) 6-3 Jakub Mensik Roman Safiullin 6-4 6-4 Taylor Fritz (3) Denis Shapovalov (27) 7-5 6-3 Adam Walton (LL) Coleman Wong (WC) 7-6(6) 4-6 6-4 Alex de Minaur (10) Joao Fonseca 5-7 7-5 6-3 Matteo Berrettini (29) Zizou Bergs 6-4 6-4 Zverev  Alexander Zverev shook off a shaky start to book his spot in the Miami Open fourth round after powering past Jordan Thompson 7-5, 6-4 on Monday. The top seed turned the match on its head after a mid-match surge, winning eight of nine games from 1-4 down in the first set. Thompson has some good wins on hard courts, and he raced into a 3-0 lead in the first set. But Zverev found his groove, Yet again, Zverev’s serve was key, and he ended proceedings with a 76% first-serve win rate (32/42) and a 77% on second serves (10/13). Jordan made it difficult for me for sure. He’s a quality player. When you’re in rhythm, he knows how to break [it] a little bit. So he did extremely well today. I’m happy with my level from 1-4 onwards, losing just one game out of [the next] nine. Zverev on his win over Thommo. De Minaur Foils Fonseca Alex de Minaur won a gritty, lung-busting victory against Joao Fonseca at the Miami Open Monday, outlasting the Brazilian teen 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in a Stadium court thriller with the raucous Brazilian crowd, turning it into a Rio carnival. After two hours and 31 minutes of pure baseline warfare, De Minaur sealed it with a cheeky camera lens scribble: ‘Rio Open :)’. De Minaur can run all day, and what he lacks in firepower is his ability to get to a lot of balls with time to spare. In the first set, with the score locked at 5-5, Fonseca roared to life, outlasting De Minaur in a brutal baseline rally to start the game; three break points soon followed, and he cashed in on the second to nab the opener. De Minaur hit back in the second, storming to 3-0 with rock-solid play as Fonseca’s serve went off the boil. However, the Brazilian recovered and was able to level at 4-4 before De Minaur broke when leading 6-5 to capture the second set. The 10th seed was rocked early in the decider, dropping serve in the opening game. Still, you rarely see the Aussie fold (barring his matches against the elite), and he dug in, grinding out long rallies, testing Fonseca’s legs, and flipping the script to snatch six of the last seven games. Last night, I think we saw why De Minaur struggles against the likes of Sinner, Alcaraz, and Djokovic, why he’s so good, and why anyone outside the top tier is in for a tough fight. Fonseca can produce elite tennis in spurts but isn’t quite at the level of the above three yet, which is why he enjoyed plenty of success against De Minaur but also why De Minaur got the better of him over three sets. He is super solid, and unless you can play PlayStation tennis like Sinner, he’ll weasel his way to the finish line. Next up? Matteo Berrettini, the 29th seed, who dispatched Zizou Bergs 6-4, 6-4. The Italian’s got a 2-1 edge in their H2H. It was a hell of a battle. I knew coming in what to expect. Not only is he an incredibly talented, dangerous, explosive player, but he’s playing with so much confidence at the moment and the crowd behind him. knew I was going to be up against it, and it was going to take every single ounce of me. I just put my head down and got to work, so I’m very happy with that win. I think, ultimately, he is a big-time player, so he’s going to go for many, many shots that might not be a high percentage. But now he’s playing with a lot of confidence and making them. Earlier, he pulled off some great backhands and hit some backhands [down the line]. That forehand is so dangerous. I know he’s still young; he’s played many matches in a row. If I could make this match physical, I would have a higher chance of it going my way. You can go out there, complain, get rattled, and do many different things, but that won’t help you win the tennis match. Ultimately, that’s what I told myself, ‘It’s going to be a battle not only against the player, against the crowd, just put your head down and do the work and try to compete every single point. De Minaur on his win. Other Matches of Note Arthur Fils took out Frances Tiafoe in a rollercoaster 7-6(11), 5-7, 6-2 win. Fils edged an insane first-set tiebreak—11-9 after saving set points. Tiafoe saved two match points in the second set before levelling, yet while he had the crowd and an early break in the decider against a cramping Fils, he inexplicably lost five games in a row as Fils won it 6-2. Tomas Machac took down the giant-serving Reilly Opelka. The Czech smoked the first set tiebreak 7-1, which is highly impressive against a server like that, and while Reilly’s bombs are back, Machac’s return game was the difference. Taylor Fritz powered past Shapovalov 7-5, 6-3. The first set was a scrap, with the Canadian breaking recovering from 2-5 to 5-5, but Fritz withstood Shapo’s flashes of brilliance and locked in for the victory.

I know he’s still young; he’s played many matches in a row. If I could make this match physical, I would have a higher chance of it going my way. You can go out there, complain, get rattled, and do many different things, but that won’t help you win the tennis match. Ultimately, that’s what I told myself, ‘It’s going to be a battle not only against the player, against the crowd, just put your head down and do the work and try to compete every single point. \u003ccite\u003eDe Minaur on his win.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOther Matches of Note\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hard-rock-stadium.jpg\" alt=\"hard rock stadium\" width=\"1354\" height=\"1020\" srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hard-rock-stadium.jpg 1354w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hard-rock-stadium-300x226.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hard-rock-stadium-1024x771.jpg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hard-rock-stadium-768x579.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hard-rock-stadium-150x113.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1354px) 100vw, 1354px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%201354%201020\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hard-rock-stadium.jpg 1354w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hard-rock-stadium-300x226.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hard-rock-stadium-1024x771.jpg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hard-rock-stadium-768x579.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hard-rock-stadium-150x113.jpg 150w\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hard-rock-stadium.jpg\"/\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\n\u003cp\u003eArthur Fils took out Frances Tiafoe in a rollercoaster 7-6(11), 5-7, 6-2 win. Fils edged an insane first-set tiebreak—11-9 after saving set points. Tiafoe saved two match points in the second set before levelling, yet while he had the crowd and an early break in the decider against a cramping Fils, he inexplicably lost five games in a row as Fils won it 6-2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomas Machac took down the giant-serving Reilly Opelka. The Czech smoked the first set tiebreak 7-1, which is highly impressive against a server like that, and while Reilly’s bombs are back, Machac’s return game was the difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor Fritz powered past Shapovalov 7-5, 6-3. The first set was a scrap, with the Canadian breaking recovering from 2-5 to 5-5, but Fritz withstood Shapo’s flashes of brilliance and locked in for the
