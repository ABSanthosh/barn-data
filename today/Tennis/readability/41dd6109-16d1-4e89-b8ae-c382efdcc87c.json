  "text": "Classy Draper 'so proud' to win his biggest titleMedia caption, Draper wins biggest title of career in Vienna - highlightsJack Draper won the biggest title of his career at the Erste Bank Open in Vienna as the British number one's breakout season reached even greater heights.Draper produced an outstanding level to beat Russia's Karen Khachanov 6-4 7-5 in the final of the ATP 500 event.The 22-year-old left-hander, who reached his maiden Grand Slam semi-final at the US Open last month, will rise to a career-high ranking of 15th in the world on Monday.\"To win this title feels incredible. I'm so proud of myself and my team – the hard work is for moments like this,\" said Draper.The victory was not all plain sailing, however. Draper watched a 4-0 advantage disappear in the second set as 24th-ranked Khachanov recovered to lead 5-4, but the Briton showed resilience to break again for 6-5 and earn the chance to serve out the victory.He had to see off two break points in the 12th game, showing his joy and relief by falling to his back on the court when Khachanov put a lob wide on championship point.It is the second tour-level title of Draper's career, having won an ATP 250 in Stuttgart earlier this season.This time last year, Draper sat just inside the top 100 as his comeback from a shoulder injury continued.Staying fit and becoming more robust has been the key to Draper's surge, allowing his talent to flourish.How 'PlayStation' start was key for DraperImage source, ReutersImage caption, Jack Draper is the first player since Andy Murray in 2014 to win the Vienna title on his debutDraper has long been seen as the future of British men's tennis, and now he is very much the player setting the standard.Improvements this year have resulted in him becoming only the fourth player from the nation since 2009 - after Andy Murray, Cameron Norrie and Dan Evans - to win an ATP 500 title.Taking time away from his opponents with a high first-serve percentage has been a feature of Draper's run in the Austrian capital.This weapon continued to be effective in a dominant first set against Khachanov.Seventh seed Draper took the initiative early with a break of serve in the third game, continually asking questions with his consistent returning and drawing Khachanov into a series of mistakes from the baseline.His confidence was clear as he secured the opening set having won 18 of his 19 first-serve points.“I felt I was playing against PlayStation at the beginning – I had no chance,” said Khachanov.Why Draper had to show his steely sideDraper had lost just five of his 34 matches this year when he had won the first set.He quickly asserted himself in the second set to ensure that formidable record would be bolstered.A rattled-looking Khachanov produced a double fault to hand over another break in the first game of the second set, which Draper took with a brilliant drop shot after patiently picking his moment.Another break to love for Draper was followed by a hold to love for 4-0.Then he started to find fewer first serves and made more unforced errors to give hope to Khachanov.After the former world number eight clawed one break back, the strain on Draper started to show.His first double fault of the match indicated tightness and handed over a second break point at 4-3 for Khachanov, who then held to move 5-4 ahead.But an extraordinary finish saw Draper dig deep and recover the advantage that his level over the match deserved.\"I didn't feel I was too nervous or too tight, just a couple of wrong decisions and Karen started swinging and upping his level,\" said Draper.\"I stayed solid and mentally in a good frame and came through. It is a relief.\"More British success as Murray wins in BaselShortly before Draper's success, Jamie Murray became Britain's first ATP title winner of the day with victory in the Swiss Indoors doubles final in Basel.Murray, 38, and his Australian partner John Peers won 6-3 7-5 against top seeds Wesley Koolhof and Nikola Mektic.It was Murray's second title of the season and his first with Peers - with whom he has reached Wimbledon and US Open finals - since 2015.However, Neal Skupski missed out on a third British success of the day when losing in the Vienna doubles final.Skupski and New Zealand's Michael Venus were beaten 4-6 6-3 10-1 by Austrians Alexander Erler and Lucas Miedler, who were given wildcards for their home event.More on this story",
