  "description": "To celebrate the end of Rafael Nadal's historic career at this week's Davis Cup Final 8, ATPTour.com is publishing a series of articles paying tribute to the Spaniard. As Rafael Nadal retires, fans will remember one of the ATP Tour’s greatest competitors. They will also reflect on one of tennis’ most iconic ambassadors, both on and off the court. The Spaniard was a hugely popular presence at tournaments around the world throughout his career. His on-court exploits earned him millions of fans globally, and his humble and gracious conduct off the court ensured he kept them. To celebrate the end of Nadal’s illustrious career, ATPTour.com looks back at some of the light-hearted, unique, and fun moments provided by the Spaniard over the past two decades. [ATP APP] The Superstitious Spaniard? When Nadal arrived on the scene as a teenage prodigy from Mallorca in 2004, some of his on-court behaviours caught the eye. They included him being meticulous with the placement of his water bottles by his chair, always letting his opponent cross the net before he did during a changeover, and always pushing his hair behind his ear before each serve. Later in his career, the Spaniard also acknowledged other fixed routines around his tennis, such as always using the same shower in the locker rooms at Roland Garros. Yet Nadal never considered these actions or mannerisms to be superstitions, but more just a reflection of him seeking complete focus as he prepared to compete. “Some call it superstition, but it’s not. If it were superstition, why would I keep doing the same thing over and over whether I win or lose?,” wrote Nadal of his water bottle habit in his 2012 autobiography, Rafa: My Story. “It’s a way of placing myself in a match, ordering my surroundings to match the order I seek in my head.” Roger Federer and Nadal during a change of ends at the 2013 Nitto ATP Finals.

In 2005, the Spaniard delivered one of the greatest seasons in history, during which he won 11-tour-level titles including his maiden major crown at Roland Garros. He did most of it wearing his own unique combinations of sleeveless tops and pirate shorts, an outfit with which his early charge to stardom will always be linked.

The then-No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings Federer and No. 2 Nadal played a three-set match on a half-clay, half-grass court at Palma Arena. The origins of the idea came from Nadal and Federer’s stunning winning streaks on clay and grass, respectively. The Spaniard had won 72 straight matches on clay heading into the exhibition match, while Federer was on a 48-match win streak on grass. In the event, Nadal overcame Federer 7-5, 4-6, 7-6(12-10).

Clive Brunskill/Getty Images Rafa \u0026 Roger Get The Giggles By 2010 Nadal and Federer were more than used to life in front of the camera, but that didn’t stop the pair suffering a bout of the giggles while trying to record a promotional video for a charity match in Zurich, Switzerland. Even after years of intense on-court battles, the clip was a reminder of the close off-court friendship between Nadal and Federer that helped define one of the greatest Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalries in history. The pair’s subsequent meeting in Zurich in December 2010 was the first ‘Match for Africa’, which later became a series of exhibition matches to raise funds for children’s education in Africa. The 2020 edition of the event, which was held in Cape Town, South Africa and raised more than US$3 million, was played in front of 51,954 people. That remains the record number of spectators at any tennis match.

In 2015, the Spaniard had the chance to soak in the atmosphere at the iconic Rio Carnival, which he attended with his countryman David Ferrer and the only Brazilian to reach No. 1 in PIF ATP Rankings history, Gustavo Kuerten. “It was the first time we had the chance to enjoy the Rio Carnival and it has been an unforgettable experience,\" Nadal said after his visit to one of the world’s most renowned street festivals. \"There was unbelievable positive energy [from] everyone. Everyone was singing and dancing, it was fantastic for me to have the chance to enjoy this unique experience.\" Rafael Nadal, David Ferrer and Gustavo Kuerten at Rio Carnival in 2015. Photo: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP via Getty Images Leaving A Legacy Even as his playing career comes to an end, Nadal’s influence on the world of tennis will live on. One way that the Spaniard can continue to shape the sport’s future is through the Rafa Nadal Academy by Movistar, which he founded on his home island of Mallorca in 2016. Nadal has frequently spoken about his desire to give back to tennis, the sport in which he has enjoyed so many historic moments of success. He revealed his thoughts on the idea of ‘legacy’ in a speech at the 2024 Rafa Nadal Academy by Movistar graduation ceremony, during which he recalled a conversation he shared with his old friend Federer during a visit to the Italian Dolomites in May 2024. “Both Roger and I agree on something we believe is of the utmost importance,” explained Nadal, who was addressing 52 graduates from the academy. “How would we like to be remembered in a few years? How do we want the future generations to think of us? We are both very sure of our answers. “It’s great that our achievements, our titles and our records are recognised, but as the years go by it is probable that someone will arrive and do something better. What is important, then, is that which will always be remembered. Therefore, both Roger and I agree that we would like to be remembered as good people.” Carlos Moya and Nadal with the Class of 2024 at the Rafa Nadal Academy by Movistar.

Shortly before its 2017 edition, the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell, where Nadal had at that point won a record nine titles, announced it was renaming its centre court Pista Rafa Nadal. “An honor to see this at the #TenisBarcelona!”, wrote Nadal at the time in Spanish on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Thank you very much @bcnopenbs”. On court, the home favourite responded to the honour in predictable fashion. He charged to his 10th crown at the clay-court ATP 500 without dropping a set, easing past the fast-rising Dominic Thiem in the championship match. Nadal went on to extend his title tally in Barcelona to 12 with further triumphs in 2018 and 2021. Un honor ver esto en el #TenisBarcelona! Muchas gracias @bcnopenbs 🙂 pic.twitter.com/RMGZaKzuw4 — Rafa Nadal (@RafaelNadal) April 26, 2017 Staying In Synch With Stef! Nadal is renowned as one of tennis’ all-time great competitors, but that did not stop the Spaniard bringing his own brand of humour to the tennis court. That aspect of his personality was on full display at the 2019 Laver Cup in Geneva, when he sheepishly informed his Team Europe doubles partner Stefanos Tsitsipas that he did not understand the Greek’s behind-the-back tactical signals. “We need to be a little bit more clear with the fingers,” said Nadal to Tsitsipas while stifling a laugh as fellow Team Europe star Federer giggled in the background. “Because I didn’t understand what you called.” Nadal and Tsitsipas were ultimately edged by Kyrgios and Sock in a Match Tie-break in Geneva, but the Spaniard finished his career with a winning 142-77 tour-level doubles record. That tally includes title runs at Masters 1000 events in Monte-Carlo (2008 w/Tommy Robredo) and Indian Wells (2010 and 2012, both w/ Marc Lopez). He also won the men’s doubles gold medal with Lopez at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Stefanos Tsitsipas and Rafael Nadal in doubles action at the 2019 Laver Cup.

Nadal immediately rushed over to Anita Birchall in what could have been a difficult moment for the youngster. Fortunately she was not hurt, and Nadal gave her a kiss on the cheek before later handing Anita his headband after wrapping up a straight-sets victory on Rod Laver Arena. \"For her, it was probably not a good moment,” said Nadal later. “The ball was quick and straight onto her head. She is a super-brave girl.” As well as his on-court apology, Nadal later met with Anita and her family and presented her with a signed cap. The episode was a demonstration of the classy statesman that Nadal was throughout his career, reflected in the fact he is a five-time recipient of the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award (2010, 2018-2021).

Nadal did his best to offer some small respite for tennis fans by hosting what what he said was his “first Instagram live, I think ever”. After overcoming some (highly relatable) early issues working out how to add people to the chat, Nadal was joined by a couple of special guests. Firstly his great on-court foe Federer came aboard, with the pair going on to discuss how they were spending their time with the ATP Tour suspended. Later, he chatted with another of his great rivals, Andy Murray, who had already joined in with some light-hearted ribbing in the IG Live comments: “This is brilliant,\" wrote the ever-witty Murray. \"[Rafa] can win 52 French Opens but not work Instagram”.

In the event, Nadal overcame Federer 7-5, 4-6, 7-6(12-10). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.atptour.com/-/media/images/news/2024/07/23/14/14/nadal-federer-2007-battle-of-the-surfaces.jpg\" alt=\"Battle of Surfaces\"/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003csub\u003e\u003csup\u003e\nNadal takes on Roger Federer in the \u0026#39;Battle of Surfaces\u0026#39; in May 2007.

The 2020 edition of the event, which was held in Cape Town, South Africa and raised more than US$3 million, was played in front of 51,954 people.

He revealed his thoughts on the idea of ‘legacy’ in a speech at the 2024 Rafa Nadal Academy by Movistar graduation ceremony, during which he recalled a conversation he shared with his old friend Federer during a visit to the Italian Dolomites in May 2024. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e “Both Roger and I agree on something we believe is of the utmost importance,” explained Nadal, who was addressing 52 graduates from the academy. “How would we like to be remembered in a few years? How do we want the future generations to think of us? We are both very sure of our answers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e “It’s great that our achievements, our titles and our records are recognised, but as the years go by it is probable that someone will arrive and do something better.

He charged to his 10th crown at the clay-court ATP 500 without dropping a set, easing past the fast-rising Dominic Thiem in the championship match.
