  "text": "Sabalenka takes out Swiatek to reach French Open finalImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Aryna Sabalenka has reached five of the past seven Grand Slam finalsFrench Open 2025Dates: 25 May-8 June Venue: Roland GarrosCoverage: Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and appWorld number one Aryna Sabalenka moved a step closer to a maiden French Open title by taking out four-time champion Iga Swiatek in a blockbuster semi-final.Sabalenka will meet second seed Coco Gauff in Saturday's showpiece after the American ruthlessly ended French wildcard Lois Boisson's incredible run.Belarus' Sabalenka earned a 7-6 (7-1) 4-6 6-0 victory to end fifth seed Swiatek's 26-match winning run at the tournament.After a slow start on the Roland Garros clay, Poland's Swiatek fought back to level but Sabalenka dominated a 22-minute deciding set.Sabalenka, whose three Grand Slam titles have all come on hard courts, has never reached the Paris final before.\"It feels incredible but the job is not done yet. I'm thrilled with my performance,\" the 27-year-old said.\"Iga is the toughest opponent, especially at Roland Garros, I'm proud I managed to get this win.\"Gauff, runner-up to Swiatek in 2022, won 6-1 6-2 against world number 361 Boisson, who was appearing in her first Grand Slam main draw.Sabalenka dominance underlines Swiatek uncertaintyThis was the potential match that everyone had their eye on when the French Open draw was made: the 'Queen of Clay' against the world number one in the crunch stages.Swiatek and Sabalenka have claimed six of the past 10 majors between them and dominated the WTA Tour over the past three years.But with Swiatek dropping to fifth in the world after a turbulent season, it was Sabalenka who came into Roland Garros as the favourite.The magnitude of the eagerly-anticipated encounter appeared to affect both players in an edgy opening set.With the roof closed because of the wet weather in Paris, Sabalenka initially settled quicker in the heavier conditions that suit her game.The pace of Sabalenka's returning was too hot for Swiatek and allowed the top seed to quickly move a double break ahead.Swiatek took a step back in her baseline position to better absorb the pace and, after being a point away from going 5-1 behind, battled back.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Iga Swiatek saw her serve broken eight times during the matchThe tweak helped a sharper Swiatek elongate the rallies and put more pressure on Sabalenka's serve, with the Pole winning the next three games to move 5-4 ahead.With both players looking tight, momentum continued to fluctuate.Swiatek's serve buckled, Sabalenka could not serve out the set at 6-5 and a nervy encounter was ultimately decided on a tie-break dominated by the Belarusian.Three successive breaks - down to quality returning as much as poor serving - began the second set before Swiatek settled down to maintain the advantage and force a decider.However, Swiatek's serve suddenly dropped off again and allowed Sabalenka to quickly reach her fifth final in the past seven Grand Slam tournaments.\"I think I lost my intensity a bit,\" said Swiatek.\"She played as strong as in the first set, but I didn't react to that well and just couldn't push back.\"Boisson's thrilling run comes to an endFor the first time since 2011, fans had a home player to cheer in the women's semi-finals - and nobody could have guessed it would be Boisson.The 22-year-old's journey from an unknown player returning from serious injury to a Grand Slam semi-finalist competing with the world's best is extraordinary.Boisson was set to be a wildcard entry last year but had to pull out after tearing an anterior cruciate ligament just a week before the French Open began.But 12 months on, she returned to make a remarkable run that will never be forgotten by French fans.Taking the scalps of third seed Jessica Pegula and sixth seed Mirra Andreeva put her into a first career semi-final on the biggest stage of all.However, Gauff proved to be a step too far.Despite having the backing of a raucous crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier, the energy provided was not enough to compensate for Boisson's lack of quality.Gauff dominated the rallies, breaking Boisson's serve six times before wrapping up victory in one hour and nine minutes.More on this story",
