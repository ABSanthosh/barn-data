The 18-year-old Brazilian delivered a five-star display to defeat 19th seed Ugo Humbert 6-4, 6-3 and reach the third round at an ATP Masters 1000 for the first time in his fledgling career. Fonseca is the youngest player to achieve that feat since Carlos Alcaraz in Paris in 2021. Born for the biggest stages üèüÔ∏èü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Joao Fonseca becomes the youngest man to reach an ATP Masters 1000 third round since Carlos Alcaraz, 18, at Paris 2021! @MiamiOpen | #MiamiOpen pic.twitter.com/jHG94Mhbwn ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) March 22, 2025 Due to a last-minute schedule change, Fonseca and Humbert's second-round clash was relocated from Grandstand to Stadium. Although the Brazilian fans arrived gradually, filling the stands by the middle of the opening set, they quickly created a lively atmosphere as Fonseca surged to victory. ‚ÄúWhen the crowd is with any player, they are more hyped,‚Äù said Fonseca. ‚ÄúI started the match today super relaxed, with no nerves. That was good, I served well. I had a quick break, he was maybe a little bit more nervous in the beginning, but I started well and that‚Äôs what made the difference. ‚ÄúAgainst lefties, they like the crosscourts with their forehand. My backhand today was pretty good and I had the chance to play more aggressively with my forehand. I didn‚Äôt let him have opportunities on my serve [either].‚Äù ¬† Fonseca broke Humbert's serve to love in the opening game and did not look back en route to a 71-minute victory, in which he did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats. In stark contrast to his opener against fellow #NextGenATP star Learner Tien, in which he suffered physically in the latter stages, Fonseca showed no signs of discomfort in a free-hitting performance. He dropped just four points on his serve throughout his encounter with Humbert, improving to 3-2 vs. Top-20 players and levelling his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with the Frenchman at 1-1. Fonseca has enjoyed a rapid rise at the start of the 2025 season. The reigning Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion claimed his maiden tour-level title in Buenos Aires in February and is now up to a new career-high No. 58 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. In the third round in Miami, Fonseca will face Alex de Minaur or Buyunchaokete. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
