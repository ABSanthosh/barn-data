The Swede tallied a 27-6 record for a winning percentage of 81.8. Johan Kriek earned the same winning percentage, but claimed fewer wins (18-4). Among active players, 99-time tour-level titlist Novak Djokovic leads the way with a 78.4 winning percentage (40-11). Nishikori is slightly behind with his 78.4 winning percentage and a 29-8 record. \"It's good to have that record because I always have good confidence, and players know that I have good records,\" Nishikori said. \"It's good pressure for them if I have that. But maybe, like, six, seven years ago I started realising that.\" Nishikori has won eight of his nine five-setters at the Australian Open. He will next take on 12th seed Tommy Paul or Christopher O'Connell. Carlos Alcaraz owns an astonishing 12-1 five-set record. However, he did not meet the 15-match minimum to qualify for the leaderboard. However, even if the Spaniard loses his next two five-setters, he will be near the top of the list with an 80 per cent winning rate. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
