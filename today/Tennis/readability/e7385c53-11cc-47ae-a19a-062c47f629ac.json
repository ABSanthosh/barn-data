In a serving masterclass from both players, it was Griekspoor who held his nerve to seal a 2-0 victory against three-time champions Germany. ‚ÄúWe have been talking about this [moment] for two or three years,‚Äù said Griekspoor. ‚ÄúWe came here all the time with unbelievably tough draws, but we believed in ourselves so much.

Despite the shift in momentum, Van de Zandschulp steadied himself to earn the opportunity to serve out the match at 5-3. Keeping with the theme of the clash, however, the Dutchman let slip four further match points before eventually sealing victory after two hours, 42 minutes on his 10th attempt.¬† The Netherlands await either reigning Davis Cup champions Italy or Australia, who face off in the other semi-final on Saturday.
