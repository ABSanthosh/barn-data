  "text": "British number two Cameron Norrie is out of the Delray Beach Open in Florida after a narrow straight sets defeat to Alex Michelsen in the quarter-finals.There was just one break of serve in the entire match as American Michelsen, who was beaten by Norrie at the Dallas Open earlier this month, won 7-6 7-5 in one hour 39 minutes.There was not even a break point in a tight first set, which third seed Michelsen won via a tie-break.A decisive moment in the second set arrived in the ninth game when world number 37 Michelsen reeled off five winners in a row to save three set points level the set at 5-5.Norrie, the 2022 winner, was unfortunate in the next game when a Michelsen forehand clipped the net cord and dropped just on Norrie's side of the court for a decisive break.The American comfortably saw out his service game to set up a last-four match against Serbian seventh seed Miomir Kecmanovic.",
