  "description": "Taylor Fritz and Joao Fonseca will have a nervy night of sleep at the Lexus Eastbourne Open, where their second-round clash was suspended due to darkness after they split sets. The top-seeded American raced through the opener 6-3 in just 26 minutes, but Fonseca dug deep to claim the second set 7-6(5). The match will resume Thursday not before 12 p.m. local time. Fritz was just two points from victory at 5/5 in the second-set tie-break, yet the 18-year-old Brazilian made a clutch volley at his shoelaces to earn a set point, which he converted to force a decider. The winner between Fritz and Fonseca will return to court later on Thursday and face American Marcos Giron in the quarter-finals. Fritz won the ATP 250 in Stuttgart two weeks ago and is 21-11 on the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Fonseca, tied at his career-high No. 57 in the PIF ATP Rankings, is aiming for his maiden Top 5 win in his first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Fritz. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
