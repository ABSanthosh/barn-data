  "description": "Turin is getting ready to host its fifth Nitto ATP Finals — the presigious season finale featuring the world’s top eight singles players and doubles teams. After the excitement of 2024 and the historic victory of Jannik Sinner, the first Italian ever to lift the title, the tennis elite will return to the Inalpi Arena from 9-16 November. Turin is already setting the stage to welcome the stars who will battle it out in November. Among the initiatives turning the entire city into a celebration of tennis, the trophy tour stands out — an exhibition of the champions’ trophy, on display in cities where the tournament’s major partners are located. The Nitto ATP Finals is on display at Turin's Gallerie d’Italia. Photo Credit: FITP Tennis The tour aims to fuel fans’ passion and project the image of the Nitto ATP Finals and the city of Turin to the world. The second part of the tour will also go international, with stops planned in countries such as Germany and Japan. The tournament’s host partner, Intesa Sanpaolo, has the honour of kicking off the tour. Fans will be able to admire the trophy from 23 July 23 to 1 August, exactly 100 days before the first point of the 2025 Nitto ATP Finals is played. The trophy — named in honour of former ATP President Brad Drewett — will be on display in the Sala Turinetti, overlooking Piazza San Carlo, on the main floor of Gallerie d’Italia – Turin. Housed in a 17th-century noble palace in the heart of the city — which is both the historical headquarters of Intesa Sanpaolo and, more recently, also one of the group’s museums — the exhibition of the Nitto ATP Finals trophy blends historical grandeur with the anticipation of what’s to come this November at Inalpi Arena: a celebration of excellence that will involve the entire city. Admission to the trophy exhibition is free during museum opening hours. Opening hours: Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday: 9:30 AM – 7:30 PM (last entry at 6:00 PM) Wednesday: 9:30 AM – 8:30 PM (last entry at 7:00 PM) [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
