  "text": "In this review, I explore the RF 01, a racket designed by Roger Federer to bring elements of his game to a broader audience. Wilson says it’s the line of rackets Federer would have used if he had successfully recovered from knee surgery in 2021. Sadly, we all know that never happened, so we can’t be sure if that is true, but at first glance, it certainly looks and feels like the type of racket you’d have seen him wielding on the court. The RF 01 is positioned between the tour-level RF 01 Pro and the lighter RF 01 Future. It is built for advanced intermediates and competitive players who seek a versatile balance of spin, control, and manoeuvrability. With its precise frame geometry and Braid 45 technology, the RF 01 is said to offer the ideal middle ground in the RF lineup. It delivers the power and stability to support an aggressive playing style while maintaining a player-friendly feel. It’s also foam-filled, which is not new but relatively rare in most modern rackets and not common in the other rackets I have playtested this year. In this detailed review, I will share my experience testing the RF 01, focusing on how it performed in various situations and whether it meets my expectations. Wilson RF01 Cosmetics \u0026 Features One of the standout aspects of the Wilson RF 01 is its sleek, minimalist design. The racket boasts a clean, polished look with no flashy colours or gimmicks. Its matte black finish and subtle Roger Federer and Wilson logos convey sophistication and understated elegance. This racket is designed for purists—players who prefer understated performance over trendy aesthetics. Its lack of bright colours or bold patterns reflects its seriousness, aimed at those who approach the game with focus and intention, like Federer himself. Regarding materials, the RF 01 is no different from most other rackets on the market. If anything, the “technology” side of things is not heavily pushed on this racket like in most new releases with the latest and greatest advancements. Instead, it’s marketed as high-quality graphite with braided fibres at 45-degree angles, which ensures a sturdy yet lightweight frame. It is also foam-filled with PU to optimise vibration dampening, which Federer requested, as he must like that feeling. Aside from the cosmetics, this racket’s design features a carefully selected beam width. As mentioned in the specification chart, the RF 01 incorporates a unique 23.2mm/24mm/22mm beam, which aims to provide a blend of stability and manoeuvrability. The slightly wider middle section (24mm) should ensure that the racket has enough stiffness to generate power. In comparison, the tapered beam towards the head (22mm) is meant to add to its control and finesse, making it easier to manipulate for touch shots and volleys. Specification and Setup I had the racket strung with Luxilon Element 1.2mm. Tension was 22.5kg on both mains and crosses. Element is a comfortable poly to consider if you want an arm-friendly monofilament.   Wilson RF 01 2024 My Wilson RF 01 2024 Head Size 98 in² / 632.26 cm² 98 in² / 632.26 cm² Length 27in / 68.58cm 27in / 68.58cm Unstrung Weight 10.6oz / 300g 10.6oz / 300g Strung Weight 11.2oz / 318g 11.1oz / 316 g Unstrung Balance 12.85in / 32.64cm / 5 pts HL 12.85in / 32.64cm / 5 pts HL Swingweight 319 320 Stiffness 64 Not measured Beam Width 23.2 mm / 24 mm / 22 mm 23.2 mm / 24 mm / 22 mm Composition Carbon + Carbon braid (Graphite) Carbon + Carbon braid (Graphite) Racket Colors Gradient black to grey Gradient black to grey Grip Type Wilson Pro Performance Wilson Pro Performance String Pattern 16 Mains / 19 Crosses 16 Mains / 19 Crosses String Tension 23-27 kg 22.5 kg First Impressions From the first moments of testing the Wilson RF 01, it appeared clear that this racket is built for precision and high-level performance despite its reasonably lightweight feel. When I first held it, the weight distribution and balance felt well suited for an aggressive, fast-paced style of play. The racket feels solid and nimble, giving me confidence that my swings will be met with a great response. As soon as I started hitting balls, these first impressions were confirmed. The RF 01 is smooth and responsive, offering exceptional feedback on every shot. Within a few minutes, I realised this racket was designed to let me dictate play while maintaining complete reliability on my touch shots. Beyond its technical prowess, I also honeymooned with this racket’s aesthetics. It is a great-looking frame. Groundstrokes The RF 01 performed admirably regarding groundstrokes, especially on flat shots and attacking strokes. The racket provides a solid connection with the ball, offering clean, crisp responses whether you are playing aggressive shots from the baseline or going for precise placement. It excelled on drive shots, particularly when stepping into the court. However, I would have appreciated it if the racket had delivered more weight to the ball during acceleration. I’m unsure if adding more weight or altering the weight distribution would negatively affect the frame’s manoeuvrability, but the specs do leave room for customisation, or as some players like to call it, a “platform racket.” Nonetheless, since the racket is not designed for monotone, fast-paced baseline play, this slight lack of power from the baseline should not pose too much of an issue if your game style is more of an all-court variable type of play. I also noticed that the racket lost control when attempting heavy topspin shots at higher speeds. The issue arose when I tried to maintain a fast pace while generating topspin. The spin potential was decent but not as strong as some other rackets I’ve tested, especially under these conditions. While excellent in terms of feeling and comfort, I suspect that the Luxilon Wilson Element string may not be the best fit for the RF 01 300g when it comes to handling aggressive topspin shots at speed. That being said, the racket’s superb manoeuvrability allowed me to generate good spin when I slowed down and focused purely on creating topspin, though I had to sacrifice some speed for that added spin. This balance may work well for players prioritising control over raw power in their topspin game. Touch Shots and Volleys The RF 01 shines in touch shots and volleys. The racket felt fast and responsive at the net, making it easy for me to precisely hit delicate drop shots and angle volleys. The frame offers excellent feedback, which gave me confidence when trying more creative and precise plays. The racket was incredibly easy to manoeuvre at the net, almost as if I were gripping it from its throat. This allowed me to react quickly to fast-paced rallies and finish points efficiently. Moreover, feeling the soft and controlled response on touch shots made me understand what Wilson and Roger had in mind when claiming this racket was designed for creative tennis players. Serves If I had to describe my experience serving with RF 01 in a single word, it would be “smooth.” The racket allowed for a good mix of power and precision. I found it easy to place serves accurately, and the power was there when needed for flat, aggressive first serves. The head-light balance also contributed to a quick swing, which helped generate decent racket-head speed on serves. However, like with groundstrokes, I felt the racket lacked some spin potential on second serves. The spin serves did not seem to have as much kick as I typically expect, likely again influenced by the string setup. Returns I particularly enjoyed testing my return with RF 01. The racket’s solid build provided stability against big serves, while its light head made it easy to manoeuvre when reacting to fast-paced shots. Whether blocking a serve back into play or attacking a second serve, the RF 01 delivered with power and precision. Its exceptional control makes it easier to guide the ball to specific spots on the court, and I think the foam-filled aspect offered some added stability and made the sound less pingy when returning fast incoming balls. Who is This Racket For? The Wilson RF 01 is undeniably designed for players who appreciate precision and touch in their game. It is an ideal racket for players who enjoy a creative, all-court style, allowing them to mix up their shots and keep their opponents guessing. The combination of power and control makes it perfect for players who want to dominate points with finesse, aggression, and variety. While the RF 01 may not excel in generating heavy topspin, its strengths in other areas make it an excellent choice for players who prioritise touch, net play, and strategic shot-making. I agree with Wilson that this racket is geared toward the next generation of creative tennis players. Compared to the RF 01 Pro and RF 01 Future Compared to the RF 01 Pro, which is heavier and geared toward advanced players seeking maximum stability and control, the RF 01 is lighter and more accessible, ideal for intermediate to advanced players who want versatility with easier handling. In contrast to the RF 01 Future, the lightest of the trio and best suited for beginners or early intermediates, the RF 01 provides a more substantial feel while still forgiving enough for a wide range of playing styles. I recommend that most players who play regularly and have a few years of experience demo the RF 01 first. The Pro model has a narrower fit at 337g strung. If you like lighter-weight frames but still like the98 square-inch head size, then the RF 01 Future is an option,   Final Thoughts In summary, the Wilson RF 01 300g delivers a good combination of elegance and performance. Its minimalist design is visually appealing and reflects its on-court performance, where precision and touch shots truly shine. I genuinely love the design—it’s undoubtedly one of the most beautiful rackets I’ve ever seen. I am also inquisitive about the RF 01 Pro’s performance, and I hope to test out that version (the one they say Federer would have used) to see if it would meet the demands of ATP and WTA-level players. Pros Super sleek design Stable feel despite 300g unstrung weight Nice weight distribution Precise feeling Cons $300 price tag Can be unforgiving, it requires good footwork and timing Have you tried any rackets from the new Wilson RF line?

The RF 01 is smooth and responsive, offering exceptional feedback on every shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin a few minutes, I realised this racket was designed to let me dictate play while maintaining complete reliability on my touch shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond its technical prowess, I also honeymooned with this racket’s aesthetics.

The racket provides a solid connection with the ball, offering clean, crisp responses whether you are playing aggressive shots from the baseline or going for precise placement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt excelled on drive shots, particularly when stepping into the court. However, I would have appreciated it if the racket had delivered more weight to the ball during acceleration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m unsure if adding more weight or altering the weight distribution would negatively affect the frame’s manoeuvrability, but the specs do leave room for customisation, or as some players like to call it, a “platform racket.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, since the racket is not designed for monotone, fast-paced baseline play, this slight lack of power from the baseline should not pose too much of an issue if your game style is more of an all-court variable type of play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also noticed that the racket lost control when attempting heavy topspin shots at higher speeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe issue arose when I tried to maintain a fast pace while generating topspin. The spin potential was decent but not as strong as some other rackets I’ve tested, especially under these conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile excellent in terms of feeling and comfort, I suspect that the Luxilon Wilson Element string may not be the best fit for the RF 01 300g when it comes to handling aggressive topspin shots at speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, the racket’s superb manoeuvrability allowed me to generate good spin when I slowed down and focused purely on creating topspin, though I had to sacrifice some speed for that added spin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis balance may work well for players prioritising control over raw power in their topspin game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan id=\"Touch_Shots_and_Volleys\"\u003eTouch Shots and Volleys\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe RF 01 shines in touch shots and volleys. The racket felt fast and responsive at the net, making it easy for me to precisely hit delicate drop shots and angle volleys. The frame offers excellent feedback, which gave me confidence when trying more creative and precise plays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe racket was incredibly easy to manoeuvre at the net, almost as if I were gripping it from its throat. This allowed me to react quickly to fast-paced rallies and finish points efficiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, feeling the soft and controlled response on touch shots made me understand what Wilson and Roger had in mind when claiming this racket was designed for creative tennis players.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan id=\"Serves\"\u003eServes\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I had to describe my experience serving with RF 01 in a single word, it would be “smooth.” The racket allowed for a good mix of power and precision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found it easy to place serves accurately, and the power was there when needed for flat, aggressive first serves. The head-light balance also contributed to a quick swing, which helped generate decent racket-head speed on serves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, like with groundstrokes, I felt the racket lacked some spin potential on second serves. The spin serves did not seem to have as much kick as I typically expect, likely again influenced by the string setup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan id=\"Returns\"\u003eReturns\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI particularly enjoyed testing my return with RF 01.
