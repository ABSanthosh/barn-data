  "text": "Sabalenka 'kept reminding self' smashing racquets 'not an option'Media caption, Anisimova stuns Sabalenka to reach Wimbledon finalWimbledon 2025Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England ClubCoverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage guide.The last time Aryna Sabalenka gave a news conference after a difficult Grand Slam loss, she handled it badly.Sabalenka later described her own comments - that French Open champion Coco Gauff had won their final \"not because she played incredible [but] because I made all those mistakes\" - as \"completely unprofessional\".So a few may have held their breath when the Belarusian arrived to do media after her Wimbledon semi-final loss to Amanda Anisimova.There were a lot of similarities. Defeat by an American over three tough sets. And crucially, another chance for a fourth Grand Slam singles title gone.But the world number one addressed it straight away, saying with a laugh: \"You're not going to see the Roland Garros press conference, so anyone who was waiting for that can leave right now!\"She spoke about her own shortcomings, credited Anisimova for being the \"braver\" player, and honestly assessed her year so far.There was still a moment or two. Asked about how Anisimova appeared to celebrate a point while Sabalenka was still running for the ball, the world number one said it annoyed her.But, she added, she was \"grateful\" for it because it helped her \"keep fighting\". Anisimova herself said it was a \"long grunt\" and not a celebration.There was also a point during the third set when Anisimova's shot clipped the net tape and dropped for a winner. Anisimova did not seem to apologise, as is traditional in tennis.Sabalenka, beaten 6-4 4-6 6-4 on Centre Court, said: \"She just wanted, I guess, badly to win this match.\"It's on her. If she barely got that point and didn't feel like saying sorry for that tricky situation, that's on her.\"As she left, Sabalenka stuck her tongue out to the media and joked: \"Ha, ha, ha, you didn't get anything!\"'I don't want to face that hate again'Sabalenka is undoubtedly the outstanding player on the women's tour. She has won 51 matches this year, claimed three titles and has a 3,741-point lead at the top of the rankings.However, the Grand Slams have been painful. She has lost back-to-back finals, with Madison Keys ending her two-time Australian Open title defence before Gauff fought back from a set down in Paris.Sabalenka is also one of the most compelling players to watch. Every emotion she feels is written all over her face, for better or worse.During the match against Anisimova, she was visibly fighting with herself. There were screams of frustration, shrugged shoulders and comments towards her box, as well as a conscious effort on the 28-year-old's part to keep the emotions at bay.Asked how she was so philosophical after the defeat, Sabalenka said: \"I just don't want to face that hate again.\"We all can lose control over our emotions. It's absolutely normal.\"Every time I was close to completely losing it and start, I don't know, yelling, screaming, smashing the racquets, I kept reminding myself that's not an option.\"It's not going to help me to stay in the match and fight for my dream.\"I took a bit more time before doing my media just so I can be Aryna, not that crazy person on that media day at Roland Garros.\"Sabalenka was a break up on Anisimova in the third set but immediately conceded it, and struggled on return in particular as the 13th seed powered towards the finish line.Sabalenka has now lost all three of her Wimbledon semi-finals and joked she had \"more of a hate relationship right now\" with the tournament.\"I really hope that one day I will turn it around and have a love relationship,\" she added.Media caption, How \"powerful\" Anisimova overcame Sabalenka",
