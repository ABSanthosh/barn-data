  "description": "The celebration of Dominic Thiem's storied career has begun at the Erste Bank Open. The former No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings was honoured on a special 'Super Sunday' at the indoor hard-court ATP 500 in Vienna. After Thiem played an exhibition set against Alexander Zverev — the man he defeated to win his only major title at the 2020 US Open — a host of tennis and other sporting icons gathered to pay tribute to the retiring star. “It was an incredible journey. You were the most important ones, opponents and friends and it was always a pleasure to be with you,” said Thiem after walking through a guard of honour that included his ATP Tour rivals Frances Tiafoe, Matteo Berrettini and Jack Draper, as well as his former coach Nicolas Massu and Germans Boris Becker, Tommy Haas and Matthias Bachinger. “It means so much to me that you were there today.” Things we love to see 🤗#DankeDomi | @ErsteBankOpen pic.twitter.com/Rzvtm4RX51— ATP Tour (@atptour) October 20, 2024 Thiem is a huge star in Austria and has been a highly popular presence on the ATP Tour with fans and fellow players alike since he turned pro in 2011. He lifted 17 tour-level trophies before his career was disrupted by a serious wrist injury in 2021. Although he returned to competing in 2022, he was unable to rediscover his best form and announced in May that 2024 would be his final season on Tour. Thiem still has one final ATP Tour event to play before he hangs up his racquet. The 31-year-old will take on Luciano Darderi in the first-round in Vienna, where he lifted the title in 2019. “I couldn't have imagined a better last Sunday in Vienna. I hope to see many of you again on Tuesday,” said Thiem to his home crowd. “It hurts incredibly that the journey is over, but it was a wonderful time.” Former rivals of Thiem to pay tribute to the Austrian at the Wiener Stadthalle included Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, who appeared in a pre-recorded tribute video. Thiem is one of only two players (alongside Andy Murray) to have earned at least five Lexus ATP Head2Head victories against each of the ‘Big Three’. “You were always a super guy, also off the court,” said Federer in German. “Always fair. Your friendship was important on the Tour. We always got on well, and it was great for me. All the best with the future, and huge congratulations on your unbelievable career, Dominic. I am sure we will see each other soon, but for now, have a great evening.” Djokovic said: “Thank you very much for all that you have given to all of us, but particularly tennis. I’m glad that you have the opportunity to say goodbye in Vienna. One last dance. I wish you a great tournament, with all your family members present, and celebrate it, because you deserve it my friend. All the best.” Zverev earlier also made his own tribute on court. “First and foremost, I'm losing a friend on the Tour, but of course we also played the greatest matches together. But it's goodbye, not goodbye,” said the German, expressing what many Thiem fans are thinking: ”I hope he gets bored in a year or two and comes back to the Tour again.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
