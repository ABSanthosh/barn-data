  "text": "Britain's Jack Draper says Jannik Sinner does not \"deserve any hate\" as the world number one prepares for his comeback from a three-month doping ban.Draper is a long-time friend of Sinner and spent several days practising with the Italian in Monte Carlo last week.Sinner, 23, was banned from the sport in February after reaching a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) over two positive drugs tests last year.The three-time major champion is able to return to competitive action from 5 May and plans to make his comeback at the Italian Open in Rome.\"When people ask about Jannik I tell the truth – I think he is a really genuine, nice person and on top of that he is an unbelievable player,\" Draper, 23, told BBC Sport and the Guardian in a joint interview at the Madrid Open.\"In this situation I am sure he would have had absolutely zero idea of anything.\"That's the way life goes - sometimes there are mistakes.\" Sinner had previously been cleared of any wrongdoing by an independent panel after testing positive for the banned substance clostebol in March 2024.It accepted he had been inadvertently contaminated by his physiotherapist, who was treating a cut on his hand with an over-the-counter spray that contained clostebol.Sinner agreed a three-month ban with Wada to settle the case and not go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.But the timing of the suspension - which meant Sinner did not miss a single Grand Slam tournament and will return in time for May's French Open - was criticised by some as being conveniently timed.The agreement between the Italian's legal team and Wada prompted accusations of favouritism and led to some players questioning their faith in clean sport.But Draper said: \"In terms of how I feel about him as a person I think it is important for people to know and recognise the guy is kind-hearted and a good human being. \"He doesn't deserve any of the hate he gets.\"After losing early at the Monte Carlo Masters, world number six Draper went looking for practice partners on the clay and Sinner - who he has played doubles with in the past - was an obvious choice.\"I knew Jannik was available and in Monte Carlo on the clay so we organised with his team to go out there for three or four days and train with him,\" Draper said.\"If you're going to train with anyone it has got to be the best in the world, right?\"He's obviously had a bit of time off but he's playing at an incredible level still.\"It was great to be around him for a few days and get some good sparring.\"The British men's number one added: \"I'm looking forward to having him back on the tour because I think his presence has been missed.\"",
