If you're playing a seed, you have a better eye for the ball, a better feel - it's not that I am against it at all.\"World number five Elena Rybakina, Australian Open semi-finalist Paula Badosa and British number one Katie Boulter are among the players with entry into the main draw in Abu Dhabi.More on this story",
