  "text": "The business end of the French Open is fast approaching, and Day Seven served up a relatively straightforward batch of matches, with only one encounter going more than three sets. Jannik Sinner delivered the performance of the day with a clinical dismantling of Jiri Lehecka, while Novak Djokovic quietly picked up his 99th win at Roland Garros. Jack Draper continued to shine, brushing aside Jo√£o Fonseca with ease, and Alexander Zverev looked sharp against Flavio Cobolli. With the draw narrowing, the intensity is rising, and as we head into the second week, the stakes only continue to rise. Here‚Äôs a look at all the key results and performances from Saturday‚Äôs third-round action in Paris. Day Seven French Open 2025 Round of 64 Results Winner Loser Scoreline Jannik Sinner (1) Jiri Lehecka 6-0 6-1 6-2 Andrey Rublev (17) Arthur Fils (14) Walkover Alexander Bublik Henrique Rocha (Q) 7-5 6-1 6-2 Jack Draper (5) Jo√£o Fonseca 6-2 6-4 6-2 Alexander Zverev (3) Flavio Cobollio 6-2 7-6(4) 6-1 Tallon Griekspoor Ethan Quinn (Q) 4-6 6-1 6-7(2) 6-1 6-4 Cameron Norrie Jacob Fearnley 6-3 7-6(1) 6-2 Novak Djokovic (6) Filip Misolic (Q) 6-3 6-4 6-2 Daily Recap Jannik Sinner (1) def Jiri Lehecka 6-0, 6-1, 6-2¬† Jannik Sinner delivered a commanding performance at Roland Garros on Saturday, dismantling Jiri Lehecka in just 94 minutes to secure his place in the fourth round. Sinner was in one of those moods where he‚Äôs virtually untouchable, and he dropped just 3 games en route to a 6-0, 6-1, 6-2 victory. I had Sinner coming through in straights, but figured Lehecka might at least force a tie break in one of the sets, as his serve is decent. However, he fell short of even achieving that. Just ruthless precision from Sinner from ball one, and Lehecka could do nothing to take him out of his comfort zone. Next up, Sinner faces Andrey Rublev, who received a walkover due to Arthur Fils‚Äô withdrawal. I‚Äôm hard pressed to see how Rublev can disrupt Sinner, as you won‚Äôt beat him by just hitting hard. I was playing really really well. Especially for two and a half sets, then he was serving very well, very brave. He made some good serve and volleys. But I‚Äôm very happy. Simone [Vagnozzi], my coach, had his birthday yesterday, and usually when he has his birthday, I don‚Äôt play well. So this win is for him. Sinner on his win. Alexander Zverev (3) def Flavio Cobolli 6-2, 7-6(4), 6-1 Alexander Zverev powered into the Roland Garros fourth round for the eighth consecutive year, defeating Flavio Cobolli 6-2, 7-6(4), 6-1 on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Cobolli has had a mixed season where he‚Äôs gone on some horrific losing runs, only to find form and win some big matches, culminating in the Hamburg title last week. Zverev, too, has had a bit of a rollercoaster year, but he was a class above today, blending powerful baseline play with his strong serving. He never really looked troubled aside from the second set where Cobolli broke his serve to lead 4-2, but Zverev responded, levelling the set at 6-6 with an ace and securing the tiebreak 7-4. I thought Cobolli played too much in straight lines to throw Zverev off his rhythm, and he got into that metronomic type play which he loves, especially on the backhand. Next, Zverev faces Tallon Griekspoor, who battled past American qualifier Ethan Quinn 4-6, 6-1, 6-7(2), 6-1, 6-4. This court is very special to me. I had some of the best memories of my life on this court, but I also had some of the worst memories on this court. It‚Äôs a love story that hasn‚Äôt got to the happy end yet, but I hope someday it will. Zverev on the French Open. Jack Draper (5) def Joao Fonseca 6-2 6-4 6-2 Jack Draper gave Jo√£o Fonseca a schooling in their match, dispatching the Brazilian 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 on Court Suzanne-Lenglen to reach the fourth round in Paris for the first time. Fonseca carries around a lot of hype, so many fans thought that he was going to test Draper significantly today, or even beat him. However, the Brit had other ideas, dominating proceedings with his heavy lefty forehand, and he out-muscled Fonseca with a varied display of spin, power and some clever drop shots. Fonseca‚Äôs game is to smash the forehand as hard as he can on basically every shot. But there is more to the game than that. That might sound critical, but there needs to be some balance to tone down the hype üòÅ. I think Fonseca has plenty of upside, but the way his fans and some of the media treat him, you‚Äôd think he was the favourite for any event he entered.¬† Draper now faces Alexander Bublik, who advanced past Henrique Rocha 7-5, 6-1, 6-2. If he serves like he did today, where he won 93% of his first serves, he‚Äôs sure to be in the quarterfinals. I played good. The conditions were quite difficult out here. I felt that the first set was really key. Then I kind of got on top of him, used my forehand well, served well and mentally it was a good performance from me and I am happy to be in the second week here. In my first two rounds I played in the night time and playing against Gael [Monfils] the other night I didn‚Äôt feel I could hit the ball past him. The guy is so quick and it was so cold. But today the ball was getting up more and the faster conditions help me more. Draper on his win. Novak Djokovic (6) def Filip Misolic (Q) 6-3 6-4 6-2 Novak Djokovic defeated Austrian qualifier Filip Misolic 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 on Court Philippe-Chatrier in the night session to notch up his 99th win at Roland Garros. As far as third-round matches at Grand Slams go, you can‚Äôt ask for better than Misolic and Novak comfortably controlled the two-hour, nine-minute match by redirecting Misolic‚Äôs pace and stepping inside the court to dominate key moments. From a total slump earlier this year, Djoker is yet to drop a set in Paris, and he‚Äôs built some solid momentum after his Geneva title. Next, he faces British lefty Cameron Norrie, who defeated Jacob Fearnley 6-3, 7-6(1), 6-2 to reach his first Roland Garros fourth round. I thought Fearnley might win that one, but Norrie has a lot of experience, and he‚Äôs always game for a battle. He pushed Novak hard last week in Geneva, so I expect the sets on Monday to be relatively close.

He pushed Novak hard last week in Geneva, so I expect the sets on Monday to be relatively close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eFrench Open 2025 Day Eight Round of 16 Matches\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/roland-garros-2023-seeds.jpg\" alt=\"french open recap\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/roland-garros-2023-seeds.jpg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/roland-garros-2023-seeds-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/roland-garros-2023-seeds-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/roland-garros-2023-seeds-390x220.jpg 390w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/roland-garros-2023-seeds-150x84.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%201024%20576\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/roland-garros-2023-seeds.jpg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/roland-garros-2023-seeds-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/roland-garros-2023-seeds-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/roland-garros-2023-seeds-390x220.jpg 390w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/roland-garros-2023-seeds-150x84.jpg 150w\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/roland-garros-2023-seeds.jpg\"/\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\n\n\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLorenzo Musetti (8) vs Holger Rune (10)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrances Tiafoe (15) vs Daniel Altmaier\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlexei Popyrin (25) vs Tommy Paul (12)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBen Shelton (13) vs Carlos Alcaraz (2)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
