The defending champion at the ATP 500 averted a scare from lucky loser Camilo Ugo Carabelli to triumph 3-6, 6-1, 6-1 on Saturday evening. Baez produced an emphatic response to letting slip a break lead to lose the opener, winning 12 of the next 14 games to advance to his ninth ATP Tour final. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so proud, because the last weeks were a little tough for me,‚Äù said Baez, who entered the tournament with just one tour-level win in 2025. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt feel very well this week, so I am happy to [have] recovered my body, my mind, my tennis‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so happy to be in a new final here in Rio, it‚Äôs so special. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always difficult to play some guys you have known since we were kids.

Yet the Argentine was unable to contain Baez, who reasserted his dominance in the encounter, drastically reducing his unforced error count from 15 to five between the opening two sets. In the decider, the Argentine opened up on return and expertly displayed his all-court prowess, finishing with 26 winners. By advancing to his second consecutive title tilt in Rio, Baez is just the third player to reach multiple finals in tournament history after Diego Schwartzman and Carlos Alcaraz. In Sunday‚Äôs championship match, the 24-year-old will face either Francisco Comesana or Alexandre Muller. With his run to the semi-finals in Rio, Ugo Carabelli is guaranteed to reach a career high on Monday as he is up to No. 69 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. After defeating his countryman in back-to-back weeks, Baez now leads Ugo Carabelli 2-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
