  "text": "Missing out on BJK Cup final 'stings' but GB success 'close'Media caption, GB's Boulter beaten as Slovakia level BJK Cup semi-finalGreat Britain missing out on a first Billie Jean King Cup final for 43 years \"stings\", but Katie Boulter believes the team are close to ending their wait for glory.Despite Emma Raducanu's opening victory, Slovakia staged a comeback in Malaga to deny GB a first final appearance since 1981, when the competition was known as the Federation Cup.It means Britain's wait for a first title in the tournament goes on.British number one Boulter, beaten by Rebecca Sramkova before Slovakia prevailed in the decisive doubles match, told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"We're so, so close. We have a great team. \"I know we can win this title, I genuinely believe that. It's just going to take a little bit more.\"It stings but I'll get past it and we'll learn for the future.\"Anne Keothavong's team were seeking to become only the fifth British side to contest the final in its 61-year history.Raducanu gave the team the perfect start by beating Viktoria Hruncakova in straight sets but, following Boulter's 2-6 6-4 6-4 defeat, Heather Watson and Olivia Nicholls lost 6-2 6-2 to Hruncakova and Tereza Mihalikova.\"Right now it is difficult because I really thought we could do it as a team,\" said captain Keothavong.\"I have to maintain positivity for myself and team and find a way to pick everyone up. We're all absolutely gutted.\"I'm so proud of this team. We still reached the semi-finals and that’s a fantastic achievement.\"Media caption, 'Irresistible!' - Raducanu starts strong for GB in BJK Cup semi-finalFormer US Open champion Raducanu enjoyed a strong week personally in Malaga, winning all three of her matches without dropping a set.The 22-year-old said it was a \"strange feeling\" to go from the high of winning her semi-final to watching the team fall agonisingly short, though added she would \"take positives\" from her performances after a two-month layoff because of a foot injury.\"I couldn't be more proud of Katie or how she fought,\" Raducanu said.\"I think it makes me really believe we can win this tournament. \"We were close. We have a great team and it makes me want to explore my doubles more for sure.\"Despite the disappointment, Boulter said she was \"proud\" after giving everything in pursuit of a place in the final against Italy.Keothavong, whose side came into the 12-nation finals as the second lowest-ranked team, added: \"I'm so proud of the way Katie has led the team as number one. \"She just fell a little short today but she has a lot of fire in the belly.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, British number one Katie Boulter has won three WTA titlesMore on this story",
