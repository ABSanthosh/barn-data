  "description": "Alexander Bublik captured his second consecutive tour-level title on Saturday at the Generali Open in Kitzbuehel, where he defeated Frenchman Arthur Cazaux for the second week in a row to lift the trophy at the ATP 250. Bublik moved past Cazaux en route to the crown in Gstaad last week and came out on top against the 22-year-old once again to taste title success at the clay-court event in the final. \"I can't believe I did it as it was probably one of the toughest weeks in my life because coming from Gstaad, playing here, different conditions and raining. I am pleased I got through and thank you for supporting me throughout the tournament,\" said Bublik, who has won three of the past four events he has played. In rainy conditions, the top seed overpowered Cazaux with his weight and depth of shot. Bublik hit freely in the first set to lead and then raised his level further during the second set, combining bruising forehands with deft drop shots to improve to 3-0 in the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series. \"I knew he was having the week of his life,\" Bublik said on Cazaux. \"That was my 14th final. but I remember the first one like it was yesterday. It was very tough but I wish him all the success. I used the few chances I had and I am happy to have won.\" Bublik, who hit 26 winners, has now won his past eight matches, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He holds a 17-2 record since Roland Garros, where he reached his first major quarter-final. By triumphing in Kitzbuehel, the 28-year-old has lifted three trophies in a season for the first time, having won Gstaad and the ATP 500 event in Halle in June. The 28-year-old upset World No. 1 Jannik Sinner en route to the crown in Germany. Bublik is up five spots to No. 25 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. He is also up five places in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, sitting 11th. The Kazakhstani joins Casper Ruud (2021) and Matteo Berrettini (2024) as the third player in the past five years to win Gstaad and Kitzbuehel back-to-back. Cazaux was competing in his maiden tour-level final. The Frenchman has climbed 25 spots to No. 75 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings following his run. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
