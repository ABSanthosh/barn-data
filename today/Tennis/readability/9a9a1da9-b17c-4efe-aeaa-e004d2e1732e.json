In his biggest final yet, the 23-year-old Brit saved his best for last, dismantling Rune in just 69 minutes to cap a flawless run that included wins over Carlos Alcaraz, Ben Shelton, and Taylor Fritz. Draper started 2025 with three five-setters in a row before being forced to retire in the fourth round of the Australian Open with a hip problem, but he’s responded smartly, playing only the Qatar Open in the lead-up to the Sunshine Double, and he powered through the Indian Wells draw, losing just one set en route to his biggest career victory.

TennisTV showed an interesting graphic pre-match that showed the ATP’s “shot quality” metric, and Draper was leading in every area across the tournament. Those stats translated onto the court as his heavy topspin forehand, effective serving, and overall game were far superior to the Dane, who was basically a spectator out there. Rune had beaten Draper in Cincinnati last year, and he came into the final having played a tactically astute match against Medvedev, but the belief was quickly sucked out from him, dropping his first two service games of the match and never recovering. Whereas Rune could handle Medevedevs baseline game easily, Draper took things up a notch with far heavier shots that he struggled to read. He was wrong-footed countless times and couldn’t find anything to cling onto that could drag him back into the match. Rune’s forehand also looked off; he never got any rhythm on that shot and almost had to muscle it on many points. On the other hand, Draper hit the ball super clean, moved well, and used the lefty advantage to great effect. He’s now in the Top 10, and it will be interesting to see just how far up the ranking he can go. It’s incredible. I wasn’t expecting this, I’ve put in a lot of work over time and I’m just so grateful and so happy to be out here to be able to play, my body being healthy, to feel great in my mind. All the work I’ve done over the last few years feels like it’s coming together on the big stage and I can’t put that into words. I feel like I deserve it, in all honestly. The amount of adversity I’ve been through, the amount of sacrifices, the amount of time that all the people around me have put into me and the hard work. It’s an emotional feeling to know how much you’ve gone through and put in, and to be here now to say that I’m going be No. 7 in the world tomorrow, I can’t tell you how much that means to me. I felt like I came out, I approached the game well. Yesterday I had a few ups and downs during the match, a bit of low energy against Carlos and I learned from that today. I knew that Holger was going to come out and be playing some really good tennis, so I needed to be aggressive and play to win from the first ball. I did an amazing job of that and I didn’t allow him to play, and I just felt like I dictated the match really well. Draper on his final win. Can Draper do the Sunshine Double?

I felt like I came out, I approached the game well. Yesterday I had a few ups and downs during the match, a bit of low energy against Carlos and I learned from that today. I knew that Holger was going to come out and be playing some really good tennis, so I needed to be aggressive and play to win from the first ball. I did an amazing job of that and I didn’t allow him to play, and I just felt like I dictated the match really well. \u003ccite\u003eDraper on his final win.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan Draper do the Sunshine Double?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eFollow Us\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAiEIWj_HbxAgWPwe_H8PACjy0qFAgKIhCFo_x28QIFj8Hvx_DwAo8t?ceid=GB:en\u0026amp;oc=3\" title=\"Google News\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cimg src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/themes/tennis-theme/assets/images/google-news.svg\" alt=\"Google News\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"120\" height=\"22\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%20120%2022\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\"/\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@perfecttennis/perfect-tennis-o1gl0gp8y\" title=\"Flipboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cimg src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/themes/tennis-theme/assets/images/flipboard.svg\" alt=\"Flipboard\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"152\" height=\"30\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%20152%2030\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\"/\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\u003c/article\u003e\n\n\t\n\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/author/perfect/\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cimg src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/perfect-tennis-avatar.png\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\" srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/perfect-tennis-avatar.png 2x\" alt=\"Jonathan\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%20180%20180\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/perfect-tennis-avatar.png 2x\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/perfect-tennis-avatar.png\"/\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\tEditor of Perfect Tennis and a big fan of Roger Federer, I\u0026#39;ve spent countless hours watching and analysing his matches.
