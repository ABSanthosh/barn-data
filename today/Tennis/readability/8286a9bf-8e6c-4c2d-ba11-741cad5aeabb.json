  "text": "Emma Raducanu was beaten by Karolina Muchova in a hard-fought match in the second round of the Dubai Tennis Championships.There were concerns for the British wildcard early in the match as she appeared to be crying and breathing heavily after Muchova broke for a 2-0 lead.Raducanu continued playing and was able to fight back from 4-0 down and force a tie-break, which she lost after missing a set point.Having secured an early break in the second, Muchova held off the 2021 US Open champion to seal a 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 victory.Raducanu, who reached the third round of the Australian Open last month, climbed back into the world's top 60 last year after missing most of the 2023 season following surgery on both wrists and her left ankle.In the first round in Dubai, the 22-year-old ended a four-match losing streak - the worst of her career - with a straight-set win over Greece's Maria Sakkari.After Muchova broke early in the opening set, Raducanu spoke to the umpire and her Czech opponent appeared to console her before the match continued.Muchova, a runner-up at the French Open in 2023, will face McCartney Kessler after she stunned world number three Coco Gauff in straight sets.Elsewhere in Dubai, Gauff suffered a third successive defeat as she fell to world number 53 Kessler.Third seed Gauff, 20, started the year on red-hot form, winning nine matches in a row.However, since losing to Paula Badosa in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open, Gauff has lost in the second round at the Qatar Open and Dubai Tennis Championships after receiving a bye in the first round at both tournaments.Kessler saved five of the six break points she faced against her fellow American before wrapping up a 6-4 7-5 victory in one hour and 29 minutes.It is the first top 10 victory of her career, while the 25-year-old is also into the third round of a WTA 1,000 event for the first time.World number one Aryna Sabalenka claimed a 6-3 6-4 victory over qualifier Veronika Kudermetova, while second seed Iga Swiatek stormed past two-time major winner Victoria Azarenka in a 6-0 6-2 win.Jasmine Paolini continued her title defence with a 6-2 7-5 victory over Germany's Eva Lys, while Ons Jabeur fell to a 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 defeat by American Peyton Stearns.Sixth seed Elena Rybakina beat Moyuka Uchijima 6-3 6-2 to set up a last-16 meeting with world number 10 Badosa, who won 6-2 6-1 against Elise Mertens.",
