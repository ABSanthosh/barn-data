The 19-year-old had just clinched his second ATP Challenger Tour title at the Oeiras Open 3 on Sunday, becoming the youngest Belgian to earn multiple trophies at that level. Blockx won his first Challenger title in November in Kobe, Japan and in the first month of 2025, the #NextGenATP teenager has returned to the winner‚Äôs circle.

The format is a bit different, but I think it‚Äôs nice to compare yourself to the group of players your age.‚Äù Following his triumph in Portugal, Blockx is sixth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah. Tien leads the group while last year's champion Joao Fonseca is second. In other Challenger action, Frenchman Sascha Gueymard Wayenburg completed a dream week on home soil in Quimper, where he lifted his maiden title at that level. The 21-year-old advanced through qualifying and ended the week with the trophy in his hands following a 6-7(3), 6-1, 6-2 final victory against Pierre-Hugues Herbert. ‚ÄúRight now, I'm on cloud nine.
