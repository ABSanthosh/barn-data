  "description": "The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, as they say. The name Borg is one of the most revered in the history of the ATP Tour, thanks to the legendary career of Bjorn Borg in the 70s and early 80s. Five decades later, his son Leo is trying to write his own story in the world of tennis. Borg won his two trophies at the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell in 1975 and 1977. The road to his first trophy began against Briton John Feaver and his other victims on the clay included big names such as Jan Kodes (quarter-finals), Guillermo Vilas (semi-finals) and Adriano Panatta (final). 50 years after his triumph, his son Leo Borg is back on the same stage to make his bow at the ATP 500 in Barcelona. His appearance, despite being in the qualifiers, saw him face a player of the same nationality against which his father began his participation in 1975. This time around, the British Jacob Fearnley was on the other side of the net. So, the name ‘Borg’ was back in the draw at the Catalan event. This time around, though, the ‘Ice Man’ was in the stands keeping an eye on his son as he took his first steps at the tournament. Although Leo failed to progress, losing 7-5, 7-6(1) to Fearnley, it was one more experience on tour under the belt of the youngster. Despite the 11 Grand Slam titles and 100 weeks Bjorn spent at the top of the PIF ATP Rankings, he is not Leo’s greatest tennis idol; step up Rafael Nadal. The Spaniard, who won the Conde de Godo Trophy 12 times, lends his name to the tournament’s centre court. Just eight months ago, he had the chance to face his hero at the ATP 250 in Bastad. “It was incredible because we were watching when they made the draw and my name came out against Rafa,” the Swede said at the time of his round-one clash with the Spaniard. Leo’s adventure at ‘Nadal’s home’ and the place where his father forged a small part of his legacy came to a premature end, but once again there was a Borg hogging the limelight on the ATP Tour in Barcelona.
