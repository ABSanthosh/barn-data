  "text": "On day 7 of the Internazionali BNL d’Italia in Rome, all sixteen men were scheduled to be in action in their fourth-round clashes at the Foro Italico. However, only seven of the eight matches were completed. Earlier rain delays forced the postponement of Casper Ruud’s round-of-16 clash with Jaume Munar to Wednesday, as the match couldn’t start before the 11 p.m. curfew, despite available courts like Pietrangeli and SuperTennis. Update: Ruud progressed 6-3 6-4 on Wednesday. Elsewhere, fans saw Jannik Sinner and Lorenzo Musetti become the first Italian duo to reach the Rome quarter-finals since 1984. Sinner battled past Francisco Cerundolo while Musetti outclassed Daniil Medvedev in a rain-interrupted tie. Carlos Alcaraz survived some lapses in focus against Karen Khachanov, Jack Draper rallied to overcome Corentin Moutet’s unorthodox flair, Hubert Hurkacz edged Jakub Mensik in a three-hour epic, and Alexander Zverev and Tommy Paul rounded out the quarter-final field with strong wins.

After starting slowly and dropping serve, Alcaraz found his form to win five consecutive games to grab the first set. Despite carrying that form into the second set with an early break, his focus wavered, allowing Khachanov to level the match. In the third, Alcaraz surged to a 4-1 lead but again let the Russian back in before a crucial break in the 12th game sealed the 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 win. This season, we’ve seen that Alcaraz can go off the boil, but he’s always been able to regroup. I thought he played well in patches, as is typical for him. But he spent hours on court, which isn’t ideal given he’s fresh off an injury. In the semi-finals, he faces fifth seed Jack Draper, who rallied past Corentin Moutet 1-6, 6-4, 6-3. Draper typically plays Alcaraz well and won their last match in Indian Wells, so it will be an interesting clash on clay. It feels amazing to get the win at the end against a really big and really tough guy like Khachanov. Physically I struggled a bit. There was not any pain on any part of the body, but I was just tired. The match was really tough. I had to run a lot, so I’m just really proud of the way I fought for every ball. At a break up in the second set, from then to the end of the second set, I probably lost focus a little bit. He started to play great, but I was really happy to forget it and come into the third set as good as I could. I just fought, and I’m really happy about that. Alcaraz on his win.

The World No. 1 was pushed through the two-hour, 16-minute battle at the ATP Masters 1000 event, but it was the gruelling 77-minute first set where both players traded breaks that proved key, as he clinched it in a tie-break after escaping a tricky 0-30 hole when serving at 4-5. After he got the lead, the second set was more comfortable. Despite dropping serve at 5-1 in the second and facing two break points in a tense eight-minute final game, he came through, saving six of eight break points overall. A brief medical timeout for a blister on his foot was the only other real drama, but I’m sure there will be some cream for that. He’s a very tough competitor, it’s a great challenge for me. Especially now trying to get used to so many difficult situations on the court. I just tried to stay there mentally, trying to play every point. But I’m very happy because I felt like I raised my level. Game wise, I felt a little bit better. It was very heavy conditions, and it was a long day. The crowd helped me, so I’m happy to go through. Sinner on his win.

With Musetti leading 7-5, 5-4, 30/30, rain interrupted play just as he earned a match point with a clever drop shot. After the lengthy two-hour and 52-minute delay, the Italian immediately returned to close the match with a forehand winner. Musetti has had a stellar 2025 clay-court season, with 21 wins in his last 25 matches on the surface, including a Monte-Carlo final and Madrid semi-final. I never really saw Medvedev being able to compete with him on this surface. Beast mode Meddy, maybe, but we haven’t seen that version of him in a long time, so Musetti can outmanoeuvre him with spins and his mouse having grown up on the surface. That being said, I thought Medvedev played pretty well, and he’s much better on clay than he was a few years ago, but for my money, Musetti is probably in the top 3/4 right now on this surface, so that’s a tough ask for him. Elsewhere, Jack Draper earned a hard-fought victory, defeating Corentin Moutet 1-6, 6-4, 6-3 to set a quarter-final clash with Carlos Alcaraz. The British No. 5 battled back from a challenging first set to progress, but early on, he had no real clue how to counter Moutet’s style of play. The Frenchman is a real bag of tricks, but once Draper started to understand what was on offer, things got closer, and the match changed midway through the second set. Moutet called for a video review in the seventh game after he felt Draper hit the ball into the ground. However, the umpire awarded the point to Draper (correctly) and Moutet threw in a poor service game to allow Draper to save for the set. Despite failing to serve out the set, Draper secured another break to force a decider. Moutet, fatigued from a nearly four-hour win over Holger Rune the previous day, took a medical timeout for his left hamstring after the seventh game of the third set, allowing Draper to close out the two-hour, 20-minute match on Super Tennis Arena. In another rain-affected match, Hubert Hurkacz edged out Jakub Mensik 7-6(5), 4-6, 7-6(5) in a gruelling three-hour, one-minute encounter to reach his first ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final since Cincinnati in August 2024. The Pole has been a bit of a non-entity in recent months, but he delivered a commanding performance, firing 16 aces and saving all three break points he faced. In the day’s final match that ended past midnight, Tommy Paul finally bagged a win on his sixth attempt against Alex de Minaur to make the quarter finals in Rome for the second straight year. It was also Paul’s first top 10 win of the season, but it was a bit of an error fest, not helped by the conditions and de Minaur played poorly to what I’ve seen from him lately.

Especially now trying to get used to so many difficult situations on the court. I just tried to stay there mentally, trying to play every point. But I’m very happy because I felt like I raised my level. Game wise, I felt a little bit better. It was very heavy conditions, and it was a long day.

Beast mode Meddy, maybe, but we haven’t seen that version of him in a long time, so Musetti can outmanoeuvre him with spins and his mouse having grown up on the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, I thought Medvedev played pretty well, and he’s much better on clay than he was a few years ago, but for my money, Musetti is probably in the top 3/4 right now on this surface, so that’s a tough ask for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElsewhere, Jack Draper earned a hard-fought victory, defeating Corentin Moutet 1-6, 6-4, 6-3 to set a quarter-final clash with Carlos Alcaraz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe British No. 5 battled back from a challenging first set to progress, but early on, he had no real clue how to counter Moutet’s style of play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Frenchman is a real bag of tricks, but once Draper started to understand what was on offer, things got closer, and the match changed midway through the second set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoutet called for a video review in the seventh game after he felt Draper hit the ball into the ground. However, the umpire awarded the point to Draper (correctly) and Moutet threw in a poor service game to allow Draper to save for the set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite failing to serve out the set, Draper secured another break to force a decider. Moutet, fatigued from a nearly four-hour win over Holger Rune the previous day, took a medical timeout for his left hamstring after the seventh game of the third set, allowing Draper to close out the two-hour, 20-minute match on Super Tennis Arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn another rain-affected match, Hubert Hurkacz edged out Jakub Mensik 7-6(5), 4-6, 7-6(5) in a gruelling three-hour, one-minute encounter to reach his first ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final since Cincinnati in August 2024.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pole has been a bit of a non-entity in recent months, but he delivered a commanding performance, firing 16 aces and saving all three break points he faced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the day’s final match that ended past midnight, Tommy Paul finally bagged a win on his sixth attempt against Alex de Minaur to make the quarter finals in Rome for the second straight year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was also Paul’s first top 10 win of the season, but it was a bit of an error fest, not helped by the conditions and de Minaur played poorly to what I’ve seen from him lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHighlights\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eItalian Open 2025 Day 8 Quarter Final Matches\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rome-day-five.jpg\" alt=\"rome day five\" width=\"677\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rome-day-five.jpg 677w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rome-day-five-300x226.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rome-day-five-150x113.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%20677%20510\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rome-day-five.jpg 677w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rome-day-five-300x226.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rome-day-five-150x113.jpg 150w\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rome-day-five.jpg\"/\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\n\n\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eJack Draper (5) vs Carlos Alcaraz (3)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLoreno Musetti (8) vs Alexander Zverev (2)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
