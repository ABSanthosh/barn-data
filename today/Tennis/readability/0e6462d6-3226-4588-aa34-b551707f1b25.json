  "description": "As the Nitto ATP Finals kicks off, the second year of the Nitto ATP Finals Torino Green Project continues to elevate the tournament’s commitment to environmental sustainability. This initiative, driven by Nitto, ATP and the Federazione Italiana Tennis e Padel (FITP), features a series of projects that connect fans, partners, and local stakeholders, underscoring the power of partnership in advancing sustainable practices within the sport. Highlight: The Green Wall In the heart of the Fan Village, visitors will find The Green Wall — a sustainability-focused installation designed with live plants, developed collaboratively by Nitto, ATP and FITP. The wall invites fans to engage directly with the theme of sustainability, offering a vibrant backdrop for photos and social media shares that promote environmental awareness. Following the tournament, The Green Wall will be relocated within Turin, an active symbol of the city’s sustainability mission. As one of the European Commission’s 100 “Mission Cities”, Turin has committed to achieving climate neutrality by 2030. Innovation Summit: Circular Economy Leadership This year’s Nitto ATP Finals Innovation Summit hosted its third edition on Friday, bringing together thought leaders to discuss the ‘Right to Repair’ and circular economy initiatives. Speakers from Nitto, FITP, the City of Turin, and the Politecnico of Torino, among other industry representatives, joined a series of roundtable discussions, focusing on innovative approaches to sustainable consumption and waste reduction. The Summit reaffirms Nitto and ATP’s shared commitment to sustainability through thought leadership and active partnership with local institutions. Fan Participation: Tracking Travel Emissions For the first time, fans attending the Nitto ATP Finals will have the chance to support the tournament’s sustainability goals by logging their travel to and from the event. Powered by Nitto in collaboration with sustainability startup LOWR, this initiative will provide valuable insights into the carbon footprint of fan travel, a major contributor to event emissions. This project is part of ATP’s broader ATP Serves strategy, which focuses on advancing the sport’s sustainability. “The Nitto ATP Finals is the pinnacle of our season, and we’re proud to see it leading the way on our sustainability roadmap,” said Massimo Calvelli, ATP CEO. “This progress is driven by partnerships, combining strengths to achieve meaningful change. Nitto’s support, alongside the commitment of all our partners, has been essential in making this event the best it can be — for tennis, our community and the planet.” This year’s Nitto ATP Finals Torino Green Project initiatives build on a successful year in 2023, with actions including planting 40 trees in the vicinity of the Inalpi Arena, installation of green roofs atop select bus stops in the city and donating €100,000 to the Municipality of Turin.",
