  "text": "'They're like my kids' - how team harmony is fuelling GB's BJK Cup runImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Katie Boulter (left) replaced Emma Raducanu as the British women's number one in 2023BJK Cup semi-finals: Great Britain v SlovakiaVenue: Palacio de Deportes, Malaga Date: Tuesday, 19 November Time: 11:00 GMTCoverage: Watch live on BBC Red Button, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website \u0026 app; follow live text commentary on the website and app; listen to BBC Radio 5 Live for updatesWhen Emma Raducanu was discovering life as a full-time player on the WTA Tour in 2022, she described herself as a \"loner\".It raised questions about whether integrating the 2021 US Open champion into the Great Britain team environment might prove difficult.In a sport where players operate as sole traders for the majority of the year, switching from a mindset of pursuing individual glory to achieving a common goal can be tricky.But the way that British captain Anne Keothavong has managed to forge a bond between her players - particularly leading pair Raducanu and Katie Boulter - has been the key to the nation's run to the Billie Jean King Cup semi-finals.On Tuesday, Britain face Slovakia as they look to reach the final of the women's team event for the first time since 1981.\"I know what's important for me in this competition, that the girls find a way to gel and get on,\" said Keothavong.\"I know from my previous experience as a player, that wasn't always the case.\"Instilling a strong camaraderie, and seeing her group thriving as a result, is a source of great satisfaction for Keothavong.It comes from a personal place. Keothavong's voice wavered with emotion as she recalled her relationship with former British team-mate Elena Baltacha, who died of cancer aged 30 in 2014.In the late 2000s and early 2010s, the pair competed for the status of British number one and for a long time did not see eye-to-eye.\"I don't think it's any secret we had our ups and downs, but towards the end we were pretty tight,\" said Keothavong.\"We were able as adults, because we were a bit older and more mature, to reflect on how we could have been better.\"When she passed away, you just think all of that was such a waste. To spend so much time being angry with each other was totally unnecessary.\"The mood in the British camp has been far from tense during their time in Malaga.When they could not leave their hotel on Wednesday because of heavy rain and flash flooding in the Andalusian city, spirits were kept high with games of spikeball and a yoga session.The group also celebrated Raducanu's 22nd birthday together. Balloons and banners were hung outside her bedroom door in the morning, followed by the presentation of a candlelit chocolate cake in the evening.The camaraderie has also been strengthened with what Raducanu describes as a \"few inside jokes\" running through the camp.\"I don't think there is any pressure. We're just enjoying ourselves,\" said Boulter.\"I know they've got my back, so no matter what happens, I'm just going to go out and do my best. I know they'll support me.\"While Raducanu and Boulter have been leading from the front, Keothavong stresses her team is more than just a double act.Harriet Dart, Heather Watson and Olivia Nicholls all put points on the board in Britain's run to the 2022 semi-finals and, although they have not yet been called upon in Malaga, have already played key roles.Watson is described as the \"life and soul\" of the group, with Nicholls also behind a lot of the \"banter\".\"Sometimes it's like when I leave my children at home, what are they up to today? It's like picking up extra kids,\" said Keothavong.Media caption, Brilliant Boulter puts GB into BJK Cup semi-finalFrivolity only gets a team so far, though. Having a Grand Slam champion like Raducanu ready to work in tandem with Boulter, a top 25 player, has been a difference-maker.Raducanu led Britain into the 12-nation knockout stage by winning both her matches in April's qualifier against France, Boulter providing the other point with one victory.In Malaga, neither has dropped a set in the best-of-three wins over Germany and Canada.\"The more I play Billie Jean King Cup, the more I enjoy it, the more I feel like the stakes are so high - but in a really relaxed and exciting way,\" said Raducanu, who had not played for two months because of a foot injury before this event.Against Slovakia, Raducanu and Boulter will again face lower-ranked opponents, meaning Britain are favourites to set up a final against Italy on Wednesday.Even if they lose, it has been a credible run given they were the second lowest-ranked team and the uncertainty over Raducanu's fitness.\"Being able to captain this team is a huge privilege for me,\" said Keothavong. \"But the job is far from over.\"More on this story",
