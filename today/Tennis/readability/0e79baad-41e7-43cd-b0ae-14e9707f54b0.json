  "description": "Novak Djokovic captured his 99th tour-level title last July when he won the singles gold medal at the Paris Olympics. Just one title short from an elusive century of tour-level crowns, the Serbian has been made to wait to join Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) as the only players to hit the 100 milestone. However, that wait may end on Sunday at the Miami Open presented by Itau after the 37-year-old advanced to his first final of the season and record-extending 60th ATP Masters 1000 title match overall on Friday in Florida. For Djokovic, the 100-title milestone has been at the forefront of his mind since his Paris triumph. “Ever since I won my 99th, which was the Olympic Games in Paris, I've been playing with the prospect of winning the special hundred titles,” Djokovic said after defeating Grigor Dimitrov in Miami. “I played finals of Shanghai. I was close there. Semi-finals of Australia. Then been trying to find that necessary and much-needed level of tennis that will put me in a position to fight for a trophy, a big trophy. “That's what I've been doing this week. I've been very happy with the way I prepared for the tournament, the way I've been playing. I haven't dropped a set. It's a great opportunity. Let's see what happens in two days.” Into a tour-level final for the 20th consecutive season – equalling a record with Federer – Djokovic will also be chasing a record seventh Miami title, pulling clear of Andre Agassi. Watching him go about his quest on Friday in Florida was footballing legend Lionel Messi, who was courtside for the Serbian’s win. Djokovic revealed that he caught up with the Inter Miami captain and World Cup winner after the match. “It was the first time I've played in front of him. I've watched him play a few times. I think finals of World Cup, I watched when he won with Argentina. I think I watched him last year once. I think it was with L.A. with Inter Miami. Obviously thrilled to have his whole family. I did see him after the match. Came by the locker room. So we spent some time talking and exchanged gifts,” Djokovic said. “It's huge honour. I mean, he's such a great athlete, not just a football player. His impact on the world of sport in the past 20 years has been immense. To have him watch me live obviously brings me great, great joy and excitement, and also a bit of pressure, to be honest. I was rated by one of his sons today as 8 out of 10, which is pretty good. He with a serious face told me I have too make 10 out of 10 next match. So I have quite a bit of pressure from Messi's son there. We joked around.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Tennis TV (@tennistv) If Djokovic can deliver a perfect 10 out of 10 performance in the final he is likely to leave Miami with the trophy. Standing in his way on Sunday afternoon (not before 3 p.m. local time) will be third-seeded American Taylor Fritz or 19-year-old Czech Jakub Mensik. The No. 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings Djokovic is expecting a tough test either way. “Whoever I face on Sunday, I'm going to have to return well because the serving from both of these guys this tournament has been also very big, like my serving performance. But these guys have more miles per hour, as well. Just big, precise serves. Big game, both of these guys,” said Djokovic, who leads Fritz 10-0 in the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series and Mensik 1-0. “Taylor, fantastic match against Berrettini. He's getting better... He's moving better than he was before. That impacts positively his game. He's obviously an American playing an American tournament, big support. I guess for both of them it's going to be the first Miami finals. For me, not my first.” Djokovic is the oldest Masters 1000 finalist in history and will try to clinch a record-extending 41st title at this level on Sunday. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
