  "description": "Confidence is everything in tennis, just ask Brandon Nakashima. After lifting the 2022 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF trophy, the American seemed primed for a rapid rise through the ranks. But the path to the top is rarely linear. Injuries and close defeats throughout 2023 slowed Nakashima’s momentum, leaving him searching for form and rhythm. Now, the 23-year-old is surging once again. At the Mutua Madrid Open, Nakashima has reached the fourth round of a clay-court ATP Masters 1000 event for the first time in his career and is on track to crack the Top 30 in the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time. “Confidence is huge in this sport,” Nakashima told ATPTour.com in Madrid. “Whether it's at the Challenger level or ATP, winning matches gives you that belief. Winning at the higher levels and in big matches really boosts your confidence. You just start rolling with it. But when you lose a few early rounds in a row, it can wear on you. “The year after Next Gen was tough with injuries and trying to rediscover my game. But it was all part of the learning process. Last year was a good one, rebuilding my ranking, playing a lot more matches. And this year, we’re focused on improving and aiming higher and it’s going well here in Madrid.” Nakashima arrived in the Spanish capital on the back of a steady 2024 season, highlighted by semi-final runs in Acapulco and Houston. However, his Masters 1000 record outside of North America had yet to reflect that progress. Coming into the week, he had never won a match at a clay-court Masters 1000. That has changed in Madrid, where Nakashima has broken new ground with wins over Flavio Cobolli and Sebastian Ofner to reach the last 16. “I think over the past couple of years, I’ve been getting more and more comfortable on clay,” said Nakashima, currently No. 29 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. “It's still a work in progress, but even a few years ago, people were telling me that my game could suit the surface well. It’s just been about getting matches, adjusting the footwork, and finding comfort out there.” With a powerful serve, increasingly heavy forehand, and reliable backhand, Nakashima feels his game is starting to click on the red dirt, but he also credits a shift in mindset. “It’s about the willingness to grind, to stay patient and work harder in each rally. That’s a big part of playing well on clay,” Nakashima said. A key part of that evolution has been his partnership with coach Mariano Puerta, a former Top 10 player and Roland Garros finalist who’s brought greater structure and tactical awareness to Nakashima’s approach. “Mariano and I have been working well together, both this year and last. He’s been a big help, not just on clay but across all surfaces,” Nakashima said. “He’s really helped develop my game and given me more clarity in how I approach matches. It’s about using my strengths, the serve, the forehand, in smarter ways. We’re both happy with where things are at.” That level will face a serious test in the next round on Tuesday, when Nakashima takes on World No. 10 Daniil Medvedev. Their only previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting came in Indian Wells last year, a match Medvedev won in straight sets. But this time, the surface and circumstances are different. “We played a couple of years ago at Indian Wells, on hard court, but I’ve developed since then. It’ll be a tough match, he’s playing well. Probably long, physical rallies. But I’m looking forward to it,” Nakashima said. Medvedev, who defeated Juan Manuel Cerundolo in his Madrid opener, echoed that anticipation. “We played two years ago but he has improved very well since,” the former US Open champion said. “I think especially kind of starting last year, second part of the season, he’s been playing well, getting a lot of great wins. I think he has a very good serve. I haven’t practised with him in a while, so it’ll be interesting.” While Medvedev looks to lift his first title since 2023 in Madrid, Nakashima is eyeing a maiden Masters 1000 quarter-final — and he’s keeping his routine simple ahead of the clash. “I’ll keep relaxing, stay off my feet,” Nakashima said. “A little practise, then me and the team like to rest, watch some sport, take it easy. Then I’ll be ready for the next one against Medvedev.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
