  "description": "Tennis has crowned its newest star at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, where Joao Fonseca on Sunday completed a perfect week to lift the trophy at the 20-and-under event in Jeddah. The 18-year-old Brazilian rallied past Learner Tien 2-4, 4-3(8), 4-0, 4-2 in the championship match at King Abdullah Sports City to become the second-youngest titlist in event history. By going undefeated across his five matches this week, Fonseca earned a tournament-record $526,480 prize money. \"I was really nervous before the match. I knew it was going to be so difficult,\" Fonseca said before lifting the trophy with former World No. 1 Rafael Nadal watching on from the stands. \"I played a final against Learner in juniors [at the 2023 US Open] and I know the way he can play. He is such a nice guy and a great player, so I knew it was going to be difficult, mentally and physically. But I got my way through.\" JOAO HAS DONE IT üèÜFonseca is the champion in Jeddah ü§©#NextGenATPFinals pic.twitter.com/UCy21lgIQb‚Äî Next Gen ATP Finals (@nextgenfinals) December 22, 2024 Fonseca started the year as No. 730 in the PIF ATP Rankings but will begin 2025 as the World No. 145. He will hope his Jeddah victory can act as a launchpad for a breakthrough season on the ATP Tour in 2025, when he will aim to add to the 12 tour-level wins (including five this week) he earned this year. Although Fonseca had shown glimpses of his potential in 2024, during which he notched his maiden tour-level win against Arthur Fils en route to the quarter-finals on home soil in Rio de Janeiro, he was competing as the lowest seed this week in Jeddah. That status did not stop him from reeling off five impressive wins in Saudi Arabia, including five-set victories against top seed Fils and third seed Jakub Mensik. \"I need to believe when I go to a tournament that I can win,\" Fonseca said. \"But now I have won it I am thinking, 'Wow, I made it'. I am very proud of myself.\" Fonseca was nonetheless made to dig deep to fend off Tien in Sunday‚Äôs final. The American was inspired in the early stages and held a set point to go two-sets-to-love clear at 7/8 in the second-set tie-break. Yet after holding his nerve to level the match, Fonseca increasingly took control with the help of some fierce forehand hitting. He raced through the third set and found a decisive break in the fifth game of the fourth set as Tien was unable to maintain his earlier level. A rock-solid serving display was the key to Fonseca‚Äôs comeback win. He won 83 per cent (34/41) of points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats, while he also triumphed in 68 per cent (15/22) of points on second serves. \"Honestly, I don't know how I did it in the second set,\" Fonseca said. \"I was just trying to keep my game strong on serve. I was not playing my best at the beginning, I was too nervous. But after the second set, I think the third set was another Joao. I was much more aggressive going for the shots and he got a little bit more tight. In the fourth set I just did my best and got the win.\" Fonseca is the third 18-year-old to lift the trophy in seven editions of the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, after current No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.

The 19-year-old American won three ATP Challenger Tour titles in 2024 and will start the new season as the World No. 122. \"I had an amazing year,\" Tien said. \"I had a great week this week.

I will try and make sure this loss does not take me down a notch. I played some really good tennis and am looking forward to next year.\" Sunday‚Äôs clash was the second Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting of the week between Fonseca and Tien. The Brazilian also prevailed in four sets in the group stage in Jeddah. Their previous meeting before this week was in the boys‚Äô singles final at the 2023 US Open, where Fonseca also lifted the trophy. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
