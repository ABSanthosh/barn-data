  "text": "When news broke that Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner tested positive for the banned substance clostebol twice, one might have expected a media storm. After all, doping scandals in sports, especially involving top athletes, usually lead to days, if not weeks, of intensive coverage, punditry, and endless headlines. Yet here we are, two months later, and the tennis world remains largely silent. Mainstream tennis journalists have done everything short of a disappearing act, carefully memory-holing the affair. One might wonder: Why the blackout? Why has this high-profile case barely been covered in the tennis media? The answer is an obvious one: it’s a conflict of interest, and it runs deep. Show me the stakeholders and tell me the stakes, and I’ll paint you a picture of how they will behave. Protecting the Golden Boys of Tennis Jannik Sinner is one of tennis’ rising stars. His potential has been touted since he first broke into the scene by winning the NextGen Finals in 2019. He represents the future of tennis in a post-Big Three world. With Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, and Roger Federer either retired or winding down their careers, tennis desperately needs new superstars. The tennis establishment has invested heavily in Sinner, and his marketability and clean-cut image are invaluable to sponsors, tournaments, and media platforms. A doping scandal involving him could tarnish Sinner’s reputation and the broader tennis brand. It’s no surprise, then, that coverage of his case has been conspicuously absent. Sponsors don’t want to be associated with a tarnished figure, and tennis journalists—many of whom have close ties to players and organisations—may be unwilling to bite the hand that feeds them. Tennis journalism is often a cosy affair, with journalists granted insider access to players, coaches, and events. But that access comes at a cost: the unspoken rule is not to rock the boat. Sadly, it’s fantasy to speak of the tennis media as those who work in investigative journalism, bravely seeking new truths, following the story wherever it leads, and fearlessly reporting the knowledge they have unearthed. You cannot trust people whose lives and careers are on the line to police the sport that pays their wages; you might as well invite Benson and Hedges to determine the dangers of smoking. All you’ll get is ream upon ream upon ream of dissembling. Yet this seems to be how they have handled the Sinner case. The Journalists’ Dilemma: Between Truth and Access Access to players is everything for tennis journalists. Without it, they lose their lifeblood—exclusive interviews and the ability to travel the circuit with the stars. Sinner is a fan favourite and media darling, and criticising him too harshly or giving his case too much attention could burn bridges. It’s not hard to see why a doping case involving a top player might quietly be swept under the carpet. After all, the people who control access to players and events are also the ones who stand to lose the most if a scandal blows up. The stakes are high. Players like Sinner generate millions in sponsorship deals, sell out stadiums, and attract lucrative TV ratings. Remember, Sinner has a $158M Nike deal, a Gucci sponsorship, and a Rolex sponsorship. These sponsors also fund the ATP and Grand Slams, which fund the ITIA and pay reasonable compensation to the Chair, who upheld Sinner’s appeal. A conflict of interest, you might say? Exposing a doping case risks all of that. It risks angering sponsors, fans, and the ATP, all of whom are vested in keeping the sport’s image squeaky clean. The Casus Belli: Why No One Wants to Address WADA’s Appeal In late September, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the ruling that Sinner had “no fault or negligence” for his two positive clostebol tests. WADA is seeking a one- to two-year ban, signalling that it believes the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) mishandled the case. Yet, where are the articles about this from top tennis outlets? Why aren’t reporters digging into the implications of WADA’s appeal? Journalists would be all over it if this were any other sport or player. But here’s the uncomfortable truth: tennis media doesn’t want to challenge the status quo. The ITIA, ATP, and other governing bodies have every reason to downplay this case, and so far, they’ve succeeded. By maintaining a low profile on this matter, they can continue to present tennis as a clean sport while hoping that Sinner’s defence—that the positive test was due to secondary transmission from his physiotherapist—will hold up under scrutiny. When “No Fault” Isn’t Enough But let’s not kid ourselves—two positive tests for a banned substance are no small matter. The fact that the ITIA accepted Sinner’s defence doesn’t necessarily mean it’s airtight. WADA disagrees, as evidenced by their appeal. The media silence around this appeal should concern anyone who cares about the integrity of the sport. Yet tennis journalists have primarily stayed mum. Is it because they don’t want to question a ruling from the ITIA, an organisation funded by the ATP, whom they rely on for access and information? Or is it because they don’t want to tarnish the reputation of a player whose success plays a starring role in the future of tennis? It’s likely both. Follow the Money In the end, this is a classic case of following the money. Sinner is a valuable commodity to the tennis world, and anything threatening his rise to stardom is terrible for business. The mainstream tennis media, tied to the same stakeholders who benefit from his success, have little incentive to expose this scandal. Like foxes guarding the henhouse, the people supposed to investigate and report on these issues have their own skin in the game. And as long as that remains the case, don’t expect much more coverage of Jannik Sinner’s doping case.",
