  "text": "Defending champion Iga Swiatek cruised through to the Italian Open third round with a crushing straight-set win over Italian wildcard Elisabetta Cocciaretto.Swiatek won 28 of 35 service points and did not face a break point as she wrapped up a 6-0 6-1 victory in just 52 minutes.The Polish world number two is seeking a fourth title in five years in Rome, with 18 of her past 19 matches at the tournament being straight-set wins - the exception being when she retired from her 2023 quarter-final with Elena Rybakina.Swiatek will play Danielle Collins in the last 32 after the American beat Elena-Gabriela Ruse of Romania 6-3 6-3.The 23-year-old - who will bid for a fifth title in six years at the French Open later this month - has reached at least the quarter-finals of her previous eight tournaments, but is yet to win a trophy this season.Japan's Naomi Osaka continued her fine run of form on clay with a 2-6 7-5 6-1 win over Swiss lucky loser Viktorija Golubic.The 27-year-old has traditionally struggled on clay, failing to make it past the French Open third round, but has now won seven successive matches on the surface.Her victory at last week's L'Open 35 de Saint-Malo was her first clay-court title - and first WTA title on any surface since becoming a mother in July 2023.Osaka had been due to play ninth seed Paula Badosa, but the Spaniard was replaced by Golubic because of injury.The four-time Grand Slam champion will play Marie Bouzkova of the Czech Republic next, after she beat Brazilian 18th seed Beatriz Haddad Maia 6-0 6-3.Italian Jasmine Paolini is also through to the third round after she defeated New Zealander Lulu Sun in straight sets 6-4 6-3. Sixth seed Paolini will play Tunisian Ons Jabeur, who advanced via a walkover because Czech Petra Kvitova was forced to withdraw from their second-round tie through injury. Jessica Pegula won 6-4 6-2 against fellow American Ashlyn Krueger and will next meet Belgium's Elise Mertens, while Madison Keys beat Varvara Gracheva of France 7-6 (7-4) 6-1 and will face Peyton Stearns in an-all US tie next. The French Open begins at Roland Garros on 25 May.",
