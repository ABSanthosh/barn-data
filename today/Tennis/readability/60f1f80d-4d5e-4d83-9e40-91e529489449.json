Ivanisevic joined Tsitsipas' team after Roland Garros and travelled with the 12-time tour-level titlist to Halle and Wimbledon.  \"As we are now following our separate ways, I have only respect for Goran — not just for what he's achieved in tennis, but also for who he is as a person,\" Tsitsipas said. \"I wish him nothing but the very best moving forward.\"Struggling to find his consistent best this year, Tsitsipas will look to return to form during the North American hard-court swing.Tsitsipas last competed at Wimbledon, where he retired in the first round due to a back injury. Frenchman Valentin Royer led Tsitsipas 6-3, 6-2 when Tsitsipas could not continue. That defeat only added to Tsitsipas' disappointing Slam results this year. The two-time major finalist lost in the opening round of the Australian Open and in the second round of Roland Garros. Tsitsipas is in danger of falling outside the Top 30 for the first time since July 2018.Tsitsipas is next scheduled to play the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers in Toronto, where main-draw action begins 27 July. The Athens native, 24th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, is aiming to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the sixth time in his career.
