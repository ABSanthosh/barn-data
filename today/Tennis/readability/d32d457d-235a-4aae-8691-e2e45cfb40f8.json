  "description": "Just two days after Stefanos Tsitsipas announced his split with Goran Ivanisevic, the Greek was on the practice court Friday in Toronto with father Apostolos Tsitsipas coaching him. The former No. 3 player in the PIF ATP Rankings was working hard under the hot Canadian sun, enjoying an afternoon training session with Karen Khachanov. The two stars, who have met in 10 Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings, spent extended time in crosscourt rallies. The 2018 National Bank Open Presented by Rogers finalist will be eager for a deep run following a 19-13 start to his season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. The 26-year-old explained his split on social media Wednesday. \"Working with Goran Ivanisevic was brief but an intense experience and a truly valuable chapter in my journey,\" Tsitsipas wrote in a statement posted on his Instagram story. \"I'm thankful for the time, effort and energy he dedicated to me and my team.\" Ivanisevic told media outlet HRT that he spoke to Tsitsipas this week, bringing their short-lived player-coach relationship to a close. “We had a nice chat, it's something that's been going on for the last ten days, there's no bad blood, we thanked each other,” Ivanisevic said. “He decided to try again with his father. I honestly, most sincerely mean this, the only person who can coach him is his dad. He played the best tennis with him, he knows him best, it's a family project.” Tsitsipas is the 23rd seed in Toronto, where he will take on Australian Christopher O'Connell or a qualifier in the second round.
