I've often chosen not to speak up, but I believe it's time to address the need for respect and professionalism in sports media. \"These moments distract from the true essence of sport and the dedication all athletes bring to the field.\"I love tennis deeply, and I want to see it represented in a way that honors the commitment we make to compete at this level.\"In a statement on Sunday, Wertheim said he made the comments in a rehearsal that was \"inadvertently\" broadcast.\"During a Tennis Channel studio show on Friday, I made some deeply regrettable comments off-air. I acknowledge them. I apologise for them. I reached out immediately and apologised to the player,\" he said on X, external.\"What happened? I joined the show by Zoom. In rehearsal we were shown a graphic of a player who had just competed. It showed her at an angle that exaggerated her forehead.\"A few moments later, I was told to frame up my Zoom. I looked at the low camera angle and joked that it made my forehead resemble the photo of the player in question. Someone in the control room chimed in and I bantered back. Though this was a private rehearsal, this exchange inadvertently, and without context, made it to live air.\"I realise: I am not the victim here. It was neither professional nor charitable nor reflective of the person I strive to be. I am accountable. I own this. I am sorry.\"In a statement to BBC Sport, Tennis Channel said: \"When Tennis Channel became aware of an inappropriate comment about a professional tennis player made by our analyst Jon Wertheim on Friday, we immediately removed him from our air indefinitely. \"The network also apologised to the player, Barbora Krejcikova, as did Jon. Jon has dedicated his career to shining a light on and growing this sport and has been a valued member of our family and the tennis community. \"That said, Tennis Channel holds its employees to a standard of respectfulness for others at all times, a standard that was not met in this moment.\"",
