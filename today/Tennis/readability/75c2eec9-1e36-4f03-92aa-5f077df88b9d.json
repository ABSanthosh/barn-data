  "description": "One year ago, Joao Fonseca had not yet cracked the world’s Top 200 and lost in the first round of Wimbledon qualifying as a 17-year-old. But a lot has changed since then, and the No. 54 player in the PIF ATP Rankings is excited for his main draw debut at the grass-court major. “For me this tournament is a dream. Everything you can see is perfect, even the flowers. Every detail is just perfect. When you come here, you just see how amazing it is,” the 18-year-old Fonseca said. “It's just a dream come true. It's for sure my favourite Grand Slam because of the culture and the history of Wimbledon. Every kid that plays tennis and wants to be a professional wants to come here.” Joao Fonseca: It All Adds Up Two years ago, Fonseca reached the quarter-finals of the boys’ singles event at Wimbledon and he will try to make his mark once again on the hallowed grass. He has earned a 1-2 record on the surface so far this season, but has also shown signs of great tennis. Last week in Eastbourne, Fonseca beat Zizou Bergs and then pushed World No. 5 Taylor Fritz to three sets at a tournament where the American is now a four-time champion. “I would say every year that I play, I'm getting more experience on the grass. It's very different from the other surfaces,” Fonseca said. “Of course, I'm liking it. I'm playing good, doing some great matches. On grass you need to focus a lot more on your service games and the opportunities that you have.” The teen will need to be ready from the first ball on Monday when he faces home favourite Jacob Fearnley (Fonseca leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 1-0). A raucous atmosphere is something the Brazilian has shown this year he is plenty happy to compete in. “It's difficult to be as loud the Brazilians,” Fonseca said, cracking a smile. “But yeah, hopefully there's going to be some Brazilians looking up and cheering for me. But for sure it's going to be a good match. “Jacob is a nice friend and a nice player. Even on Court 1, it's just going to be a dream playing my first match here in Wimbledon.” Fonseca practised on No. 1 Court, the setting for his opening encounter at the season’s third Grand Slam tournament. This year’s Buenos Aires champion marveled at his surroundings. But ultimately, he is fully focused on making as deep a run as possible. “Expectations are good. On grass you don't have very much of weeks to get the experience. You need to adapt at the time that you have,” Fonseca said. “I have good expectations. I'm playing good. I'm making some good practices. Yeah, my [mentality] is good, my confidence. I'm just going to enjoy.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
