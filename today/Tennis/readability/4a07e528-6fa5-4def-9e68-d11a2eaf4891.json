Brandon Nakashima and Christopher Eubanks did their part Thursday, advancing at the ATP 250 in Houston — where six of the quarter-finalists are Americans — with two spots still up for grabs. The fourth-seeded Nakashima earned his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head win across five meetings with Mackenzie McDonald, claiming a 6-1, 7-5 victory. “Mackie is a great friend of mine. We have a lot of fun off the court together. Every time we play it’s going to be a battle,” the 23-year-old Nakashima said. “I think today I served really well and definitely feeling pretty comfortable on the clay.” Nakashima won 82 per cent of his second-serve points, compared to McDonald’s 45 per cent, and did not face a break point throughout the 78-minute match, according to Infosys ATP Stats. [ATP APP] Competing as World No. 33 in the PIF ATP Rankings, one spot off his career high, Nakashima will next face the 6’7” Eubanks, who advanced after Kei Nishikori retired with the American leading 6-1. The Americans vying for the final two quarter-final spots are second seed Frances Tiafoe and fifth seed Alex Michelsen. Tiafoe meets Australian Adam Walton on Thursday evening before Michelsen takes on French lefty Adrian Mannarino. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
