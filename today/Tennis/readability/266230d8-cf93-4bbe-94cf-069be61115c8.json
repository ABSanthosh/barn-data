  "text": "Sonay Kartal's dream run at Indian Wells continued as the British lucky loser beat Polina Kudermetova to reach the fourth round.Kartal had checked out of her accommodation after losing in the final round of qualifying - but the world number 83 earned a spot in the main draw after the withdrawal of Sloane Stephens.The British number three moved to a hotel, external, claimed the biggest win of her career in round three and then beat Russia's Kudermetova 7-5 6-3 to reach the fourth round of a WTA 1,000 event for the first time.\"I booked an apartment to see me through qualifying so I had to find somewhere else to stay last minute,\" said Kartal.\"I was homeless for about 12 hours. But it was a good problem to have.\"Kartal's reward is a last-16 meeting with world number one Aryna Sabalenka after the three-time major champion won 6-1 6-2 against Italy's Lucia Bronzetti.Regardless of that result, 23-year-old Kartal will move to a career-high in the rankings at the end of the hard-court tournament.A higher ranking will help her secure direct entry to the big tournaments outside of the four Grand Slams.Kartal had a superb end to 2024, winning her first WTA Tour title and breaking into the world's top 100.It came after a difficult start to the year where the Englishwoman was \"in and out of hospital\" after a health scare.After three months out, Kartal returned to the tour and steadily worked her way up the rankings before triumphing in Monastir in October.She came back from an early break down against Kudermetova, winning three games in a row to take the first set, before taking advantage as her opponent's shot-making grew ragged.\"It wasn't as comfortable as it maybe looked,\" said Kartal.\"My goal was to hold my serve and make her play every ball and keep the scoreboard pressure high. \"I kept my cool and upped my level when it mattered the most.\"She will face a tough task against Belarusian top seed Sabalenka, who described herself as \"hungrier on court\" after losing in the Australian Open final in January.Madison Keys, who beat Sabalenka in Melbourne to win her first major title, also progressed on Monday, beating Elise Mertens 6-2 6-7 (8-10) 6-4.American Keys has yet to lose a match this year and will face either compatriot Emma Navarro or Donna Vekic for a place in the quarter-finals.",
