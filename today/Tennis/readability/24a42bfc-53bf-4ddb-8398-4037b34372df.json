  "text": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Stefanos Tsitsipas (left) won the Dubai Tennis Championships title in MarchStefanos Tsitsipas has parted ways with Goran Ivanisevic after a \"brief but intense\" coaching spell.Greece's Tsitsipas began working with Ivanisevic in May after winning only two matches in his past four Grand Slam appearances.However, he won only one match during the grass-court season and was two sets down against qualifier Valentin Royer in the Wimbledon first round before retiring injured.Croatian Ivanisevic - a former Wimbledon champion who worked with Novak Djokovic for six years - was also critical of Tsitsipas' fitness., external\"I'm thankful for the time, effort and energy Goran dedicated to me and my team,\" Tsitsipas, 26, wrote on Instagram.\"As we are now following our separate ways, I have only respect for Goran - not just for what he's achieved in tennis, but also for who he is as a person.\"Tsitsipas has been as high as number three in the world and was runner-up to Djokovic at the 2021 French Open and 2023 Australian Open.He is currently 29th in the rankings and has not gone beyond the second round of a major since last year's French Open.\"I've talked to him a lot of times. If he solves some things outside of tennis, then he'll return to where he belongs,\" Ivansevic told Serbian outlet Sportklub after Tsitsipas' Wimbledon exit.\"I have never seen a more unprepared player in my life. With this knee, I am three times more fit than him. This is really bad.\"Ivansevic also had a short spell working with former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina at the start of the year.",
