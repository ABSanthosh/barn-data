  "description": "Matthew Ebden and Jordan Thompson’s fledgling partnership took little time to settle this week at the Libema Open. On Saturday, the all-Australian pair downed Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool 6-4, 3-6, 10-7 to clinch the ‘s-Hertogenbosch ATP 250 title in their first ATP Tour event together. The third-seeded Ebden and Thompson, whose only previous tour-level match as a pair was a victory against Tommy Paul and Ben Shelton in the 2024 Davis Cup quarter-finals, won five of the final six points to prevail against Cash and Glasspool. Ebden and Thompson won 79 per cent (27/34) of points behind first serves, according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to a 74-minute victory in the Netherlands. It was Thompson’s eighth tour-level doubles crown, while it was a 13th for Ebden and his first since he won gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics alongside John Peers. “It was a great week,” reflected Thompson, the No. 10 in the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings. “For me, I had a tough one in singles. Second round, and I lost two match points, but it was a great opportunity for me to get back out on the doubles court. Playing with Matt, we gel well together. We play Davis Cup together, so it’s enjoyable to play with each other. Hopefully it’s building for next week at Queen’s.” Ebden added: “It’s awesome. Especially playing out there with a fellow Aussie, we’ve shared a lot together over the years, and in Davis Cup particularly. To bring that on the Tour and make a great start here with a title, we couldn’t ask for more.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
