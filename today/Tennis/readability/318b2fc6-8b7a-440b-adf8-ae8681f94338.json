Reigning champion Swiatek had won nine consecutive matches in Madrid - and 15 of 16 going back to her loss to Sabalenka in the 2023 final - but had no answer to Gauff.Gauff, who won the US Open in 2023, hit seven aces and won 19 of 21 points on her first serve in a dominant performance.\"I was aggressive and played with margin. Maybe it wasn't her best level,\" Gauff said in her on-court interview.The American, who edged past Dayana Yastremska in three sets in her opening match last week, added: \"I felt great out here on the court today, much different to my first match here in the first round.\"I think the previous times we played on clay I don't think I had a win against her yet.\"Obviously on clay she's a different player, but clay is one of my better surfaces too, and I thought if I can beat her on hard I can beat her on clay.\"",
