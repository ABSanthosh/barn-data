The Norwegian, previously winless in his two previous Masters 1000 finals, matched Draper’s powerful lefty game before outlasting the Briton to claim his career’s biggest trophy. In a two-hour, 29-minute battle, Ruud became the first Norwegian to win a Masters 1000 title and will comfortably be seeded in the top 10 at the French Open later this month after he notched three Top 10 victories during the tournament defeating No. 4 Taylor Fritz, No. 10 Daniil Medvedev, and No. 6 Draper en route to grabbing 1000 ranking points.

Both guys had their moments, and both had some drop-offs in level. Not an all-time classic by any means, but there was some furious hitting, and Draper’s flatter penetrative shots clash well with Ruud’s heavy top-spin forehand. Draper started strong, breaking Ruud early to forge a 5-3 lead. He capitalised on his aggressive play, and his ability to crack the backhand cross-court is deadly. However, Ruud fought back, breaking Draper when the Brit served for the set at 5-4, hitting some pinpoint forehands, before stealing the set 7-5. I thought Draper had a bit of a lull in his intensity towards the end of the set and took his foot off the gas, which was a shame as he looked the stronger player until Ruud started returning better towards the end of the set. After letting out some frustration during the set changeover, Draper regrouped and raised his level to dominate the second set. He broke Ruud twice, exploiting the Norwegian’s inconsistencies and only dropping four points behind his serve as he levelled the match at 3-6. The deciding set was a battle. Ruud appeared fresher of the two despite a rib injury from the semifinals, whereas Draper showed signs of fatigue and frustration, not helped by two time violations and a slip that jarred his knee. Still, he fought valiantly, saving three break points in a marathon third game. However, after failing to convert two of his own break point chances in game four, he couldn’t keep Ruud at bay as the Norwegian broke for a 3-2 lead. From there, Ruud took charge, dropping just three more points on serve and surging to 40-0 when serving for the match, which sealed the victory when Draper couldn’t return a final forehand, ending 6-4. If Draper had not played that sloppy service game in the first set and won the opener, he’d likely have done it in straight sets. But the longer the match wore on, Ruud looked stronger physically and started to serve well, and the Brit began to tire. Draper’s spot serving dropped off, and he couldn’t dictate as much from the baseline. While he still had some flashy winners, I thought Ruud played the big points better and looked stronger in the legs. Considering Draper had straight-set wins all week, it’s not a great sign that he looked somewhat gassed in the third set (left thigh taped so perhaps a niggle). So, I’m a little unsure how he’ll do in more classic clay conditions in Rome and Paris. I think some of the guys who can grind will approach matches with a plan to keep him out there for as long as possible. It feels great, of course. It’s been a long time coming, This was one of the really big goals I dreamed about when I was young, so it’s an incredible feeling to accomplish it. Also the way I did it today, it was a great match. I knew Jack had been playing unbelievable all year, and especially in this tournament, so I knew that if I didn’t bring my A-plus game, I was going to be whooped around the court. Luckily, I played really well. Jack has become such an incredible player, on any surface now. He’s won title on every surface except [clay], and he’s already made finals here in Madrid. So it’s an incredible year he is having. This is a really big boost for me, and I would like to keep it going. Ruud on his Madrid title win. What did you think of the final?

While he still had some flashy winners, I thought Ruud played the big points better and looked stronger in the legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering Draper had straight-set wins all week, it’s not a great sign that he looked somewhat gassed in the third set (left thigh taped so perhaps a niggle). So, I’m a little unsure how he’ll do in more classic clay conditions in Rome and Paris. I think some of the guys who can grind will approach matches with a plan to keep him out there for as long as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt feels great, of course. It’s been a long time coming, This was one of the really big goals I dreamed about when I was young, so it’s an incredible feeling to accomplish it. Also the way I did it today, it was a great match. I knew Jack had been playing unbelievable all year, and especially in this tournament, so I knew that if I didn’t bring my A-plus game, I was going to be whooped around the court. Luckily, I played really well. Jack has become such an incredible player, on any surface now. He’s won title on every surface except [clay], and he’s already made finals here in Madrid. So it’s an incredible year he is having. This is a really big boost for me, and I would like to keep it going. \u003ccite\u003eRuud on his Madrid title win.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat did you think of the final?
