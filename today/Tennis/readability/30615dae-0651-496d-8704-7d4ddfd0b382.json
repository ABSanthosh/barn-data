Sonego was going well this time, but Shelton broke to lead 2-1 in the fourth set and turned the match around.Shelton took a medical timeout at the end of that set for treatment on his left ankle. He clinched victory with a sliced backhand that a full-stretch Sonego patted into the net.Earlier Sunday, eighth-seeded Lorenzo Musetti eased into the second round 7-5, 6-2, 6-0 against qualifier Yannick Hanfmann of GermanyMusetti has reached at least the semifinals in the past three Masters tournaments at Rome, Madrid and Monte Carlo, where he lost in the final to four-time Grand Slam champion Carlos Alcaraz.The 23-year-old Musetti reached the semifinals on grass at Wimbledon last year, but has not reached the quarterfinals at any other major.Still, he believes he can win the French Open.\"I feel ready to try to go for the trophy,\" Musetti said. \"I think clay probably is the surface which I feel the most comfortable.\"Also advancing Sunday were American players Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe.The 12th-seeded Paul won 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 against Elmer Moller, an unseeded Danish player ranked 112th, while the 15th-seeded Tiafoe -- a two-time US Open semifinalist -- beat Roman Safiullin 6-4, 7-5, 6-4.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
