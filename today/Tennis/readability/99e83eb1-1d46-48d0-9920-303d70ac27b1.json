Having reached the second round of the Australian Open in January, Raducanu decided to skip the French Open to focus on her fitness.She reached the fourth round at Wimbledon to return to the world's top 100 but was beaten in the first round of the US Open by American Sofia Kenin in August.Top seed Aryna Sabalenka had to come back from a set down to reach the quarter-finals at the Wuhan Open, but world number three Jessica Pegula suffered a surprise defeat.Belarusian Sabalenka, 26, lost a one-sided first set to Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva but recovered to win 1-6 6-4 6-0, winning each of the final nine games.However, American second seed Pegula fell to a straight-set loss to China's Wang Xinyu.The 51st-ranked Wang is through to her first WTA 1000 quarter-final, holding her nerve to take her second match point after being broken when serving for a place in the last eight at 5-4.Meanwhile, Italian third seed Jasmine Paolini and American fourth seed Coco Gauff both safely progressed.Paolini won 6-3 6-2 against Erika Andreeva - who defeated sister Mirra on Wednesday - while Gauff, winner of last week's China Open, also sealed a straight-set win, beating Marta Kostyuk 6-4 6-1.Wimbledon and French Open runner-up Paolini will meet Chinese fifth seed Zheng Qinwen, after she beat battled back to win 5-7 6-3 6-0 against Canada's Leylah Fernandez.",
