  "description": "The Andrey Rublev Foundation has partnered with Bambino Gesu Children’s Hospital in Rome, one of the leading paediatric hospitals in the world, to support medical care for underprivileged children. In April, Rublev visited the hospital ahead of the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Rome. There, he spent time with members of the medical staff and patients undergoing treatment. He also provided presents to the children. “We met a few kids at the hospital... Some of them [were] recovering from a tough surgery, some of them [were] waiting for surgeries,” said Rublev. The foundation is committed to supporting children from abroad facing serious or complex medical conditions and who require access to specialised treatment in Rome. “We are very excited to be partnering with the Bambino Gesu Children’s Hospital in Rome,” said Lisa Hernandez, the Director of the Andrey Rublev Foundation, which hopes to help as many children as possible. “We are going to be providing financial aid to international patients to come here and receive special treatment and get surgeries and hopefully make a difference for a couple of children around the world.” Rublev launched the Andrey Rublev Foundation in 2024. The foundation is dedicated to helping children in need by providing access to transformative care. Learn more about the foundation. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
