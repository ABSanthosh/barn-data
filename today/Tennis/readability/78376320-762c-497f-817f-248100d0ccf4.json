He won a club tournament a couple of years ago and has been seen hitting with his dad on Wimbledon's practice courts.American 23-time Grand Slam singles champion Serena Williams' eldest daughter Olympia is a natural at the sport, according to her mum - but she prefers playing golf.Meanwhile, tennis legends Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf made a conscious decision not to try to force their children into picking up the sport.Graf - a 22-time major singles champion - said the pair had \"never really introduced tennis so much in their lives\".Agassi wrote in his autobiography Open about how strict his own father was and said in 2024, external: \"The idea that a parent would attach a child's right to be loved in this world based on their performance is a tragedy.\"What somebody needs to do to be pro at 16 years old is crazy, right?\"",
