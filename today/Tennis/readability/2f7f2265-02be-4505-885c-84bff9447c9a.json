  "text": "Australian Open 2025Dates: 12-26 January Venue: Melbourne ParkCoverage: Live radio commentary on Tennis Breakfast from 07:00 GMT on BBC 5 Sports Extra, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and appBritain's Jodie Burrage says she came to close to quitting the sport last year as she fought back from another serious injury setback.Burrage, who also thought about quitting the sport in 2020 after a series of injuries, missed six months of the 2024 season with wrist and ankle issues.Having made her comeback on the lower-tier ITF Futures Tour, the 25-year-old broke down in tears during a training session and questioned whether it was worth the hardship.\"I was basically crying mid-session, saying I don't know how much more fight I've got,\" an emotional Burrage said.\"I fought so hard to get to a position where I could even play the sport, but it's not where I wanted to be and I wasn't happy with how I was playing.\"But Burrage persevered because of her \"love for this crazy sport\" - and is now preparing to return to Grand Slam action at the Australian Open.Burrage was at a career-high of 84th in the world rankings in February when she needed surgery on a snapped tendon in her wrist.But she suffered another blow in April as she prepared to return to competitive action.Burrage ruptured an ankle ligament in a practice session with British number one Katie Boulter and, although she did not require surgery, she missed another 10 weeks.She finally returned to court in September at a WTA event in Monastir before the emotional moment in November where she questioned her future during practice at the National Tennis Centre.It was a sliding doors moment. Burrage fought on. A week later she reached the final of a Futures event in Slovakia, then lifted the trophy in Dubai straight afterwards.\"That's the funny thing about tennis,\" said Burrage, who is playing in Melbourne under a protected ranking and faces French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean in the first round.\"Literally five days later, I started in Slovakia, made the final and then I win the biggest title of my career in Dubai.\"It was very up and down. Those six months were really, really hard.\"Asked what stopped her quitting, she said: \"For some reason, I love this crazy sport. That's what kept me going.\"The fight, being here [in Melbourne], working hard, working towards something. \"I feel like I've got so much more to give.\"",
