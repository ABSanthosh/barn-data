  "text": "British number one Jack Draper reached the final of the Qatar Open with a 3-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-3 victory against Jiri Lehecka.The Czech Republic's Lehecka took control of the opening set after breaking serve in the eighth game, before a more even second set went to a tie-break.Draper - who defeated former Wimbledon runner-up Matteo Berrettini on Thursday - produced a near-flawless performance in the tie-break to send the match to a decider.The final set went with serve until a double fault from Lehecka gifted the 23-year-old Briton a break, with the Czech throwing his racket to the floor in frustration.Draper, whose recent injury problems have been well-documented, broke serve again with his second match point to give himself a chance of winning a third career title.\"I thought in the first set I put in a sloppy game,\" Draper said. \"I started to get a lead on his [Lehecka's] serve, holding easier and creating a lot of pressure behind his serve. \"I felt more positive as the match went on. I'm proud of the way I competed out there.\"Draper, who reached the Australian Open fourth round in January, will meet Andrey Rublev in Saturday's final after the Russian defeated Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime 7-5 4-6 7-6 (7-5).An even contest came down to a thrilling deciding set, with world number 10 Rublev securing victory with his fourth match point.\"I feel that I'm playing better and better week by week, I'm improving,\" said Rublev, who has won all three previous meetings with Draper.Meanwhile, Saturday's men's doubles final will be an all-British affair after Neal Skupski and Joe Salisbury beat Britain's Henry Patten and Finland's Harri Heliovaara 3-6 6-3 10-5.Earlier on Friday British pair Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash defeated India's Yuki Bhambri and Croatia's Ivan Dodig 7-6 (7-3) 6-3.This will be the third ATP Tour final between two all-British teams, with all three involving at least one of the Skupski brothers.",
