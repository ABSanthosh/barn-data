  "text": "British number one Jack Draper fought back from a set down to beat Matteo Berrettini and reach the Qatar Open semi-finals.Former Wimbledon runner-up Berrettini took the opening set, but world number 16 Draper, whose recent injury problems have been well documented, responded in style to wrap up a 4-6 6-4 6-3 victory over the Italian. \"I felt in the second set I was knocking on the door and not quite taking my opportunities but I stayed strong,\" Draper told Sky Sports. \"It was such a tough battle against such a great player. In Australia I was very proud of my efforts because I got to the fourth round without playing any tennis in the off-season. \"I worked really hard with my coach and fitness and I am just glad I have found a better level this week, playing matches and getting my confidence back.\"Draper will now face Jiri Lehecka in the last four after the Czech player claimed a shock 6-3 3-6 6-4 victory over top seed Carlos Alcaraz. It was only the second defeat of the year for Spain's four-time Grand Slam champion, who also lost to Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in January.Russia's Andrey Rublev defeated second seed Alex de Minaur of Australia 6-1 3-6 7-6 (10-8) to set up a semi-final meeting with Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime, who was awarded a walkover victory against Daniil Medvedev after the Russian retired with illness.",
