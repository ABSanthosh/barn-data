Italy's Sinner, who has recently returned from a three-month doping ban, will start against France's Arthur Rinderknech.Defending men's champion Carlos Alcaraz opens against Japan's former world number four Kei Nishikori.Novak Djokovic, who is aiming for a standalone record 25th Grand Slam, has been pitted against American Mackenzie McDonald.The draw was conducted at Roland Garros on Thursday, with France and Paris St-Germain footballer Ousmane Dembele picking out the names, before the clay-court Grand Slam begins on Sunday.All eyes on who struggling big names could faceSwiatek has dominated the women's singles with four titles in the past five years, but comes into the clay-court major in uncertain form.The Pole has not won a tournament this year and has dropped to fifth in the world - meaning she could face the leading players earlier than usual.All eyes were on which quarter Swiatek would land in, with Italian fourth seed Jasmine Paolini - who Swiatek beat in last year's final - her potential last-eight opponent.To get that far, though, she might have to see off Raducanu and 11th seed Elena Rybakina - another former Grand Slam champion - in the fourth round.Djokovic, perhaps not surprising as age catches him up, has also been well below his best.He lost three matches in a row to start the clay swing and ended the coaching partnership with Andy Murray last week.His draw could have been much worse in Paris.The Serb great, who turned 38 on Thursday, has German third seed Alexander Zverev and Russian 11th seed Daniil Medvedev in his quarter.Who are the other Brits facing?The other British players in the men's singles have landed eye-catching draws.Jacob Fearnley's rapid rise continues with a French Open debut against 40-year-old three-time major champion Wawrinka, who won the Roland Garros title in 2015.Cameron Norrie has been given a rematch against Russia's Medvedev after the former world number one beat the Briton recently in Rome.In the women's singles, British number one Katie Boulter starts against a qualifier as the 28-year-old aims to finally land her first Roland Garros main-draw win.She warmed up by winning a WTA 125 title in Paris last week.Sonay Kartal is playing in the main draw for the first time, having climbed more than 200 places in the rankings over the past year, and opens against Erika Andreeva of Russia.If she wins her first two matches, 23-year-old Kartal could again face Coco Gauff - who beat her in the Wimbledon second round last year.Jodie Burrage, playing under a protected ranking, faces a tough test against big-hitting former world number seven Danielle Collins.'Real test of the Brits begins' - analysisThe first part of the European clay-court swing has been encouraging for the leading British players – now the real test of their credentials is about to begin.Although Raducanu has made positive steps over recent months, she still does not feel totally at ease on clay. Does she have enough natural movement and quality to cause a shock if she meets Swiatek? You would think not - even if the four-time champion has been below her best.Draper, beaten in the first round last year, has become a genuine force on clay.Reaching the Madrid final and Rome quarter-finals illustrated his rising stock, but the fifth seed has been handed a tough draw.If he comes through against Bellucci – a creative left-hander trying to crack the top 50 – a host of bigger names are lurking down the line.Sinner is the standout name as a potential quarter-final opponent, although he could have to find a way past Joao Fonseca, Hubert Hurkacz, Jakub Mensik or Alex de Minaur before then.Other standout first-round matchesMen's singles[30] Hubert Hurkacz (Pol) v Joao Fonseca (Bra)[3] Alexander Zverev (Ger) v Learner Tien (US)Robert Bautista Agut (Spa) v [10] Holger Rune (Den)Tomas Martin Etcheverry (Chi) v [20] Stefanos Tsitsipas (Gre)Full draw, externalWomen's singles[1] Aryna Sabalenka v Kamilla Rakhimova (Rus)Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova (Rus) v [8] Qinwen Zheng (Chn)[4] Jasmine Paolini (Ita) v Yue Yuan (Chn)Naomi Osaka (Jpn) v Paula Badosa (Spa)[12] Elena Rybakina (Kaz) vs Belinda Bencic (Swi)Full draw, externalMore on this story",
