With British coach Jamie Delgado guiding the conversation, the top-seeded Sinner lit up with a large grin when asked about his night in the kitchen. “Yesterday was my turn,” Sinner said in the YouTube video produced by Wimbledon. “Very simple stuff. We made an omelette, a kind of Spanish omelette. Didn’t turn out that well, but still, it was eatable.” While Sinner was testing his culinary skills the night before, Medvedev was having some fun of his own. The ninth seed was playing cards with his team, including coach Gilles Cervara, who did not escape a bit of teasing. “You should not play cards with Gilles, because he plays 10 minutes and then he says, ‘Okay, I have to go, I have to go, I have to go',” Medvedev joked. “So we cannot finish the game. So he won a couple of rounds and then the physio was finishing the game for him.” Should Sinner and Medvedev clash for the second consecutive year at the grass-court major, it would not be until the final. Medvedev claimed their 2024 Wimbledon clash in five sets, but Sinner leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 8-7. Even last year’s battle was a laughing matter in Friday’s practice, with Medvedev cracking, “The roof is still closed!” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
