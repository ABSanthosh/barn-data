  "text": "Carlos Alcaraz has been knocked out of the 2024 ATP Finals following a straight-set defeat by Alexander Zverev in Turin.Second seed Zverev secured top spot in the group with a 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 win and will face American Taylor Fritz in the semi-finals.Wimbledon and French Open champion Alcaraz, who only won one of his three group matches, was forced to await the result of the evening match between Andrey Rublev and Casper Ruud for his elimination to be confirmed.He would be out if Ruud took a single set against the winless Russian - and the Norwegian secured his last-four spot by taking the first en route to a 6-4 5-7 6-2 victory.Ruud, seeded sixth in Turin, will face home favourite and top seed Jannik Sinner in the knockout stage.But Zverev looks the man to beat in Italy - he has won all three group matches in straight sets without having his serve broken.The 27-year-old played it down though when asked whether he is currently playing the best tennis of his life.\"You guys have got to relax a little bit,\" he said after beating 21-year-old Alcaraz. “Three fantastic matches, now the semi-finals will be very difficult. Taylor [Fritz] has beaten me a few times at the slams.\"Alcaraz has beaten me too many times this year so I'm glad to get this one. We have a great rivalry and friendship, I'm always glad to play him – unless he wins.\"Zverev continued his impressive form against Alcaraz, who has struggled with a chest complaint during this tournament and once again wore a pink nasal strip to aid his breathing.\"It has been a difficult week for me struggling with some physical problems,\" said Alcaraz, who added that he hopes to return for the Davis Cup finals in Malaga next week - which will also be team-mate Rafael Nadal's final professional tournament.\"Today I faced one of the best players in the world, without a doubt, playing really solid and great tennis.\"Seemingly still feeling the effects of that illness, Alcaraz was again off form but showed some fighting spirit to save seven break points in the first set, then two set points – before Zverev superbly converted the third.Zverev had four of those break points saved in the fourth game of the match, then had set point on Alcaraz's serve when leading 6-5, but hit a cross-court forehand long following an extensive rally. The Spaniard forced the tie-break but Zverev was once again able to get his nose in front.After both produced superb shots during the tie-break – including a terrific cross-court lob from Alcaraz – Zverev managed the best to finally secure the set.His third set point saw the German dig out an attempted Alcaraz winner with a brilliant half-volleyed pick-up near the net. Alcaraz spooned the returning volley wide and Zverev roared in celebration.Zverev only needed to win that first set to guarantee his spot in the last four but he was determined to secure the win to get the top spot in the John Newcombe Group.The break in the second set was easier to come by, as Alcaraz fired a straightforward volley into the net to give up the immediate advantage.The third seed psyched himself up enough to force two break points against Zverev at 3-2 – the first the German had faced in the entire tournament – but was unable to convert before Zverev saw out the match.Alcaraz's form has been a gift for Ruud, who comfortably beat the Spaniard in their opening group game.Ruud, however, was then beaten by Zverev, meaning he needed to secure at least one set against eighth seed Rublev in this final match to ensure his place in the last four.And he did so after a tight opening set, celebrating with a roar matched by his support team.Ruud followed this up by winning in three sets, condemning Rublev to three defeats from three for the second successive finals.He will start his semi-final as the underdog against Australian and US Open champion Sinner on Saturday night.\"I'll have to keep it going tomorrow - I'll need it,\" Ruud said. \"Sometimes you feel if you are an underdog you can play free, and know if you bring less than your A game you will lose.\"There's no doubt Sinner is the best player in the world. Playing at home, hasn't dropped a set - he is the player to beat. This guy almost forgot how to lose! I have to come up with something to challenge him tomorrow.\"",
