I'll just take it day by day and give myself the best chance,\" Kyrgios said.Who are the other Brits facing?Seven British players have direct entry into the main singles draws, although Harriet Dart and Billy Harris were unable to join them after losing their final qualifying matches on Thursday.Cameron Norrie has been handed a difficult start against Italy's Matteo Berrettini - a 2022 semi-finalist at Melbourne Park and one of the most dangerous unseeded players in the men's draw.Like Fearnley, Sonay Kartal is playing in her first overseas Grand Slam following the best season her career.The 23-year-old faces Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, with Sabalenka potentially waiting in the second round.Jodie Burrage, who has used a protected ranking after missing a large chunk of last season through injury, has been pitted against French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean.Burrage, 25, also has the likelihood of facing a superstar in the second round in third seed Coco Gauff.Sinner avoids Djokovic and Alcaraz until finalAlthough the unpredictable nature of a Grand Slam means things do not always pan out as expected, the draw ceremony is always an exciting event that allows fans to plot what may happen.The leading two seeds are split, meaning they cannot play each other until the final - should they get that far.Sinner has been drawn in the same half as American fourth seed Taylor Fritz and Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev.It means Sinner cannot play 10-time champion Djokovic or Spain's Carlos Alcaraz, who is aiming to complete the career Grand Slam aged just 21, until the semi-finals.Despite being at the opposite ends of their careers, Djokovic and Alcaraz have developed an intriguing rivalry which has produced some enthralling encounters.The pair could meet again in the Melbourne quarter-finals.In the women's draw, Sabalenka could face Gauff - who faces 2020 champion Sofia Kenin in a tough all-American first-round opener - in the semi-finals.Neither Sabalenka or Gauff can face second seed Iga Swiatek, who begins against Katerina Siniakova of the Czech Republic, until the final.More on this story",
