  "text": "Wimbledon winner Purcell admits anti-doping breachImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Max Purcell is ranked 12th in the world in doubles Two-time Grand Slam doubles champion Max Purcell has been provisionally suspended after admitting a breach of anti-doping rules.The 26-year-old Australian has taken a voluntary suspension after admitting breaking World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) rules relating to the \"use of a prohibited method\".Purcell, whose major titles came at Wimbledon in 2022 and this year's US Open, said he had \"unknowingly received\" an intravenous infusion of vitamins which was above the 100ml limit allowed by Wada.Purcell said he alerted the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) - the independent body which enforces Wada rules - after the issue came to light when he received medical records last week.\"This news was devastating to me because I pride myself on being an athlete who always makes sure everything is Wada safe,\" he said.\"I volunteered the information to the ITIA and have been as transparent as possible to put this issue behind me.\"Purcell has been provisionally banned from playing in, coaching at or attending any tennis event.The ITIA did not detail the length of Purcell's ban but it was effective from 12 December.\"Time served under provisional suspension will be credited against any future sanction,\" said the ITIA.The provisional suspension could rule Purcell out of the Australian Open in Melbourne, which starts on 12 January.The ITIA charged men's world number one Jannik Sinner and women's world number two Iga Swiatek over breaches of its anti-doping programme this year. Italian Sinner, 23, twice tested positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March, which he denied knowingly using.An independent panel accepted there was \"no fault or negligence\" on Sinner's behalf.He is awaiting the outcome of an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) over his exoneration. Swiatek accepted a one-month suspension after testing positive for a banned heart medication in August.The 23-year-old Pole said the violation was not intentional.More on this story",
