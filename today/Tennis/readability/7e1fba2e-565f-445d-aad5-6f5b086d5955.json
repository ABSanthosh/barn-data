  "text": "'The older guys versus the younger guys' - what makes Djokovic-Murray tickImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Djokovic beat Murray in five of their seven meetings in Grand Slam finalsWhether it is providing detailed insight about an Australian Open opponent or carrying his racquets to the stringer, Andy Murray has got Novak Djokovic's back.The recently retired Briton has even been chasing down drop-shots at the end of practice sessions.Over the past fortnight in Melbourne Murray has shown he is willing to do whatever it takes to help Djokovic win a record 25th Grand Slam title.\"They're in this together,\" Murray's former coach Dani Vallverdu told BBC Sport.\"It's the feeling of the older guys against the younger guys - that's what's driving them.\"Before Djokovic faces German second seed Alexander Zverev in the Australian Open semi-finals on Friday, BBC Sport looks at what we have gleaned so far about one of the most intriguing player-coach partnerships in tennis history.What Djokovic gets from MurrayMarginal gains. The 1%. Every elite athlete looks for that tiny bit extra - and Djokovic has always found it. That's why, as he targets even more Grand Slam success in the twilight of his career, he turned to a man who knows him better than almost anyone else on the ATP Tour.Born a week apart in May 1987, Murray and Djokovic first became acquainted as 12-year-olds at junior tournaments.The rivalry continued into the senior game as they met in 36 tour-level matches, including seven Grand Slam finals.\"Having someone in his box, and the locker room, who has been through it all on the opposite side of the court gives Novak a feeling of familiarity,\" said Vallverdu, who was part of Murray's team when he beat Djokovic to win Wimbledon in 2013.\"There is someone who understands him and has understood him from the other side of the court.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Andy Murray and Carlos Herrera Gomez, another key part of Djokovic's team, react rather differently during the Serb's first-round win in MelbourneNot only does he know Djokovic inside out, but Murray also knows his potential opponents.Murray has played everyone Djokovic has faced from the third round onwards in Melbourne - Tomas Machac, Jiri Lehecka, Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev - in the past four years.\"I know what the speed of their serve is like, what the top-spin on their shots is like, and hopefully have a decent understanding of their strengths and weaknesses,\" Murray said.During Djokovic's quarter-final victory over Alcaraz, former British number one Annabel Croft spotted the Serb going low down the middle more during the rallies.Asked afterwards by a small group of British reporters about his tactical input, Murray grinned.He refused to take the credit, insisting it was all Djokovic's own work. But given his meticulous attention to detail, it would be a surprise if Murray isn't studying hours of video footage and combing through statistics.\"When Andy played he was one of the more data-driven players out there,\" said former Australian player John Millman, who is working as an analyst, external with host television broadcaster Channel Nine.\"He felt better going into a match with that wealth of information. I'm sure he's bringing that into the Djokovic camp.\"A calmer Djokovic - what happens on courtBefore Djokovic's remarkable quarter-final win, a relaxed Murray told BBC Sport he was enjoying the experience of his first coaching job.His demeanour in the players' pod has not always suggested that.Murray has worn a serious expression during Djokovic's matches, particularly during the victory over Alcaraz.Motivating fist pumps were rare, tactical exchanges were sparse.While Djokovic often looked over to his team, including a worried glance when he injured his upper left leg, there have been fewer outbursts than we have been used to seeing.In fact, Djokovic has been rather calm by his standards. Perhaps that is the Murray effect.After his victory over Alcaraz, Djokovic walked straight over to Murray and buried his head in his chest.Djokovic's ability to outlast the best of his younger opponents - namely Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner - had been questioned coming into the Australian Open.\"The main benefit for Novak is that he thinks they're in it together and trying to beat these younger guys as a team,\" said Vallverdu.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Djokovic, who is bidding to reach a 38th Grand Slam final, has shown fewer outpourings of emotion over the fortnightTaking notes and carrying racquets - what happens in practiceWhile Djokovic has not practised at Melbourne Park since beating Alcaraz, there have been plenty of chances over the fortnight to see how the team dynamic works.During a warm-up hit with Britain's Jacob Fearnley before the quarter-final, Murray watched every movement intently from behind the baseline.When the session wrapped up, Djokovic embraced Murray before the pair - to the delight of the several hundred watching - had a quick knock on court.A couple of gentle rallies ended when Djokovic, rather brutally given Murray's fitness issues, brought out a drop-shot which the Scot dutifully chased down.Then it was back to collecting Djokovic's racquets and taking them to the stringer.\"When I saw Andy walking through the corridors with all Novak's racquets, taking them to the stringer, you could see he is taking this job very seriously,\" Australian former world number four Sam Stosur told Channel Nine.Djokovic's pre-tournament practice sessions against Alcaraz, Jack Draper and Arthur Fils offered more insight.Standing close behind Djokovic and sometimes in the doubles alley, Murray constantly offered feedback, shouted praise after winners and made notes.He also compared observations with Boris Bosnjakovic, who ran Djokovic's training centre in Belgrade before becoming part of the team last May after long-term coach Goran Ivanisevic left.\"It's about making small changes to things and trying to help him and improve with the whole team,\" Murray said.What it's like working with DjokovicIt is no secret that Djokovic is a demanding guy.After winning a record 23rd Grand Slam men's title two years ago, Djokovic admitted he had been \"torturing\" his team during the tournament.His then coach Ivanisevic, speaking after Djokovic beat Casper Ruud in the 2023 French Open final, joked that the player \"chained\" his team \"with handcuffs\".Eye-popping tirades in his native Serbian towards them were a regular sight.\"He's not [an] easy guy, let's put it this way - especially when something's not going his way,\" said Ivanisevic.Djokovic and Murray have not given many details about their coaching arrangement or about how much time they are spending together off the court.Before the Australian Open Murray admitted the work had already been \"demanding\" - despite having only linked up for a 10-day practice block in Spain and a few days in Melbourne.He also knew it would become more \"stressful\" during the tournament.\"The rewards at the end of it can be great,\" said Murray. \"And that's something that I'm looking forward to.\"More on this story",
