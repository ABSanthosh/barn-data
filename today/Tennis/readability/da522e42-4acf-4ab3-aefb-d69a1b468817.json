It is great to have these feelings in the first round.\"Alcaraz won titles in Monte Carlo and Rome in the build-up to the French Open and finished runner-up to Holger Rune in Barcelona - his only loss in 16 clay-court matches in 2025. But those performances followed a surprise opening loss to David Goffin at the Miami Open in March, with victory at the Rotterdam Open his only success on hard courts this year.Discussing his form this season, Alcaraz said: \"We all know the rollercoaster that has so far been this year for me - making really good results, then losing the first round.\"But right now I think I found a really good path again. I think I'm just starting to get it, feeling more comfortable approaching the matches. \"Once I start the matches, I think I'm just keeping the high level in the whole match and during the whole tournament. \"Alcaraz, who now holds a 19-3 record at the French Open, plays Hungarian Fabian Marozsan in the second round.More on this story",
