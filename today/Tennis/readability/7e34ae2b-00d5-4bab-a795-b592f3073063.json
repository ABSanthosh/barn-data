  "description": "Novak Djokovic set out with a point to prove on Friday at the Miami Open presented by Itau, where the six-time champion marked his first appearance since 2019 with a resounding victory. Having been forced to retire from his Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev in January, and suffering opening-round defeats in Doha and Indian Wells, Djokovic entered Miami on a three-match losing streak. Yet the fourth seed delivered a clinical display to see off Rinky Hijikata 6-0, 7-6(1) and spark hopes of a turn in form. “I wanted to make a statement to myself and to others that I'm still able to play at a high level,” said Djokovic. “I lost two tournaments in the first rounds, so I really was eager to get the win in the first match in Miami. “[I played] perfect tennis for a set and a half. I think he had stepped it up in the second set, deservedly took it to a tie-break, and then I played a great tie-break. All in all, there is always something you can work on, but for me it's just about maintaining this level of tennis and trying to be even better if I can as the tournament progresses.” With his second consecutive Lexus ATP Head2Head victory over Hijikata, Djokovic equalled 22-time major winner Rafael Nadal for the most ATP Masters 1000 wins (410) since the series’ introduction in 1990. But there are further feats that the 37-year-old would relish achieving in Florida this fortnight. Djokovic is bidding to record his 100th tour-level trophy, which would cement himself as the third man to hit a century, after Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103). If he were to claim a seventh title in Miami, he would also move clear of Andre Agassi (6) as the most successful player in the tournament’s history. “Miami, for sure. I'd love to celebrate the 100th win here,” said Djokovic when asked of his preferred destination to hit the century mark. “But let’s see, it's a long tournament. Of course it encourages me knowing that I can play the way I played today, but it's a long ride. “Hopefully I can do well and I can get myself in a good position in the finals to fight for a trophy. That would be amazing.” In 2023, Djokovic came within one match of completing the Grand Slam, losing only to Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final. He finished the year with seven titles (his biggest haul since seven in 2016) and by winning his seventh Nitto ATP Finals and capturing ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours for a record-extending eighth time. But in 2024 his lone title came at the Paris Olympics and he has remained agonisingly on 99 career titles since. After an error-strewn performance in his Indian Wells opener, in which he struck 37 unforced errors to fall to Botic van de Zandschulp, Djokovic appears to have refound his rhythm. The Serbian used his early exit to good effect as he fine tuned his preparations ahead of another record-chasing fortnight. “I had two weeks since the last match that I played in Indian Wells, so I had plenty of time to work on my game,” said Djokovic, who saved each of the two break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, against Hijikata. “I think that has positively reflected on my game today, particularly for set and a half, almost flawless tennis. I'm very pleased with the way I felt and played on the court.” The former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings will continue his quest for a first trophy since July last year against lucky loser Camilo Ugo Carabelli in the third round on Sunday.
