  "description": "Could Jannik Sinner’s Wimbledon title run have been kick-started by the power to forget? Coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi certainly believe that the first big step for their charge in the run-up to the grass-court major was him showcasing the ability to quickly move past his Roland Garros disappointment. Sinner held a two-set lead and later three championship points against Carlos Alcaraz in Paris before falling to a heartbreaking defeat, but the No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings swiftly banished that memory with a title triumph five weeks later at SW19. “After Paris it was tough, but we spoke a lot,” said Vagnozzi after Sinner downed Alcaraz in four sets on Sunday to clinch his maiden Wimbledon crown. “We spoke that we were really proud what he did in Paris. We came here with all the purpose to have a good tournament. It started really well. He had really good week of practice the week before, so we were really confident that he was able to play a good tournament here. “But for sure his mental strength is really strong. We are lucky to work with a guy like this that every day is going on the court with a right mentality, with a good attitude. So we are really proud of him.” Let’s hear it for the Champion! 🙌@janniksin | @Wimbledon | #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/EhhhbGFrmK — ATP Tour (@atptour) July 13, 2025 Cahill not only cited Sinner’s ability to move on from Roland Garros as evidence of his charge’s mental strength. The Australian also praised the way his charge had responded after a tough fourth-round outing against Grigor Dimitrov at the All England Club: After Sinner fell and hurt his elbow in the first game of the match, Dimitrov took a two-set lead before being forced to retire after injuring his pectoral muscle. “We in the box always had faith that he was going to get himself out of that match, but yes, he caught a break,” said Cahill. “We kept reiterating to him that Grand Slams, in men's tennis, it's seven matches, it's best-of-five. Nobody goes through a tournament without a hiccup, whether it be an injury or a little bit of luck or you get yourself out of an early round problem. Everybody has a story in a Grand Slam. Maybe this was going to be his story. “So take it for what it is, put it to one side, and his main job was to concentrate on his next opponent. If you beat the next opponent, then you move on, and you make the most of it. He does that. It's the same way he approached his loss at Roland Garros. He saw it for what it was, understood that he played an incredible match at Roland Garros. He was beaten in the end by a better player. “He never played a better clay-court match than what he played there. So he knew he was improving as a tennis player, and he was able to put it to one side and just focus on the next day. That's a pretty rare quality to have.” It All Adds Up For Jannik Sinner At Wimbledon 2025: With his championship-match victory on Centre Court, Sinner snapped a five-match losing streak against his friend and rival Alcaraz, whom he now trails 5-8 in the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Cahill recognised the significance of his charge registering his first tour-level win against the Spaniard since a semi-final triumph in Beijing in October 2023. “Today was important for many, many reasons,” said Cahill. “Carlos has had the wood over him for the last five matches. They've played amazing matches, and Jannik has had chances in maybe four of the five matches they've played to beat him. He hasn't been able to get the victory. ”So today was important not just because it was a Grand Slam final, not just because it was Wimbledon, and not just because Carlos had won the last five matches against him. He needed that win today. So he knew the importance of closing this one out when he had the opportunities.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
