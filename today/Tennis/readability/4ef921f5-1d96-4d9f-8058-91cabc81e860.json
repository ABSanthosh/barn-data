There is a deep mutual respect between the two legends, a sentiment Djokovic captured perfectly in a social media tribute to Nadal, who on Thursday announced that he will retire in November. “One post is not enough to express the respect I have for you and what you have done for our sport,” Djokovic wrote. “You have inspired millions of children to start playing tennis and I think that’s probably the greatest achievement anyone can wish for. Your tenacity, dedication, fighting spirit is going to be taught for decades.” Rafa, one post is not enough to express the respect I have for you and what you have done for our sport.

Djokovic and Nadal have met a record 60 times, with the Serbian holding a 31-29 lead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. It is one of the greatest rivalries not only in tennis, but in sports. “Your legacy will live forever,” Djokovic added. “Only you know what you had to endure to become an icon of tennis and sport in general. Thank you for pushing me to the very limit so many times in our rivalry that has impacted me the most as a player.” The 38-year-old Nadal will compete in his final professional event at the Davis Cup Finals, to be held in Malaga, Spain from 19-24 November. “Your passion for representing Spain has always been remarkable,” Djokovic said. “I wish you the best possible farewell in Malaga with the Davis Cup team of Spain. I will be there in person to pay respect to your stellar career.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
