The third-seeded Frenchman on Wednesday overcame Hugo Dellien 6-7(5), 6-1, 6-4 in Marrakech to reach his third ATP Tour quarter-final of the season. Muller, who is competing this week at a career-high No. 41 in the PIF ATP Rankings, converted five of 13 break points he earned during his two-hour, 26-minute win, according to Infosys ATP Stats. ‚ÄúIt was a little bit difficult to play today, it was really windy,‚Äù said Muller in his on-court interview. ‚ÄúI just tried to focus and to really want to win the match. That was the key today, so I‚Äôm happy to get the win. I think between the first half and the second half, I really focused on myself and did not focus on the conditions and everything. In the first set I was focused too much on it. By the end, I think I was playing quite well.‚Äù The 28-year-old Muller began 2025 by lifting his maiden ATP Tour trophy in Hong Kong, while in February he reached the biggest championship match of his career in Rio de Janeiro. Now 11-6 for the season, he will take on Kamil Majchrzak in the Marrakech quarter-finals. The Polish qualifier later defeated Jesper de Jong 7-6(3), 6-1. Also on Wednesday, the 2023 champion and 2024 finalist Roberto Carballes Baena improved on his stellar recent record in Marrakech by powering to a 6-4, 6-4 triumph against Otto Virtanen. The Spaniard earned two break of serve in each set to prevail in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Virtanen. He will meet Portugal's Nuno Borges in the quarter-finals.
