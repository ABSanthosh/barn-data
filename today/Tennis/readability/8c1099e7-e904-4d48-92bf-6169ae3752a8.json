  "text": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Aryna Sabalenka is yet to drop a set at the Miami OpenWorld number one Aryna Sabalenka reached the Miami Open final with a comprehensive straight-set victory over Italy's Jasmine Paolini.The 26-year-old Belarusian is yet to drop a set at the tournament and was in fine form as she stormed to a 6-2 6-2 win over sixth seed Paolini.Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam champion, has now reached two finals in succession, having lost to Mirra Andreeva at Indian Wells earlier this month.This is the first time she has reached the Miami showpiece and Sabalenka will face either teenage wildcard Alexandra Eala, of the Philippines, or American fourth seed Jessica Pegula for the trophy on Saturday. They face each other in the second semi-final on Friday.Top seed Sabalenka delivered a clinical performance on Thursday, dominating Paolini with powerful serves and punishing groundstrokes.Aside from two mistimed overheads and an ambitious 'tweener' shot which did not have enough power to trouble her opponent, Sabalenka barely put a foot wrong as she surged to victory in just one hour and 13 minutes.\"Super-happy that I was able to give myself another chance, another final, another opportunity to hold a trophy,\" Sabalenka said.\"She's an incredible player so I knew I would have to work for every point. \"I focused on my serve and tried to hit as low as possible because she hits flat. Super-happy with the level I played.\"Sabalenka has reached her fourth final in 2025, winning in Brisbane in January before defeats by American Madison Keys at the Australian Open then by Andreeva at Indian Wells two weeks ago.More on this story",
