  "description": "Croatia and Argentina have qualified for the United Cup in 2025 and round out the top 18 countries set to compete across Perth and Sydney from 27 December to 5 January. Croatia will be led by Paris Olympic Games singles silver medallist and Wimbledon semifinalist Donna Vekic and former world No.12 Borna Coric for the third consecutive year. Seven-time Grand Slam doubles champion Ivan Dodig will also star as part of the Croatian side. “It’s honestly my favourite tournament of the year,” Vekic said. “We have great energy in the team.  Borna has been my friend for more than 20 years. It feels like a little family. We are not a team, we are a family. “To be pushing each other and supporting each other especially at the beginning of the year, it’s special.” Team Croatia fall into Group A in Perth to set up some thrilling matches against top seeds Team USA and Canada during the group stage. They play Team Canada in their opening tie from 10.00am Saturday 28 December at RAC Arena. Twenty-eight-year-old Vekic will face Leylah Fernandez and Coco Gauff in her singles matches. “It’s going to be two really tough matches to start the year. But that’s what we want, I think it’s great preparation for the Australian Open. I think I’ll have to train extra harder in the off season, which is great motivation as well.” Argentina, led by world No.40 Tomas Martin Etcheverry and Nadia Podoroska, complete Group F. This is Argentina’s second appearance at the United Cup. Podoroska – a Roland Garros semifinalist in 2020 – and Etcheverry return to represent their country after doing so at the inaugural event in 2023. They face host country Australia on the opening night of play in Sydney from 5.30pm on Saturday 28 December at Ken Rosewall Arena followed by Great Britain two days later.",
