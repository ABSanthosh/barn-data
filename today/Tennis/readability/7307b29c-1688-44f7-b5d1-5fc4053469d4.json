  "description": "Richard Gasquet, the former No. 7 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, revealed in an interview with L’Equipe plans to retire next year after Roland Garros. “I think that it is the best moment for me to do it,” Gasquet said in the French interview. “It is the best tournament to do it. It’s magnificent, we have the chance being French to be able to stop in these kind of incredible places. An end, it’s always complicated, all the former great players always told me it’s not easy to announce. You never know when, how, where. Here, in any case, it is obvious.” The 38-year-old, who turned pro in 2002, has spent more than two decades in the spotlight. Having graced the cover of French Tennis Magazine at age nine, Gasquet won his ATP Tour debut match aged 16 at the 2002 Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters against Franco Squillari.
