  "description": "The ATP recently filmed a special feature with Novak Djokovic in which the former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings answered questions from his peers, including Jannik Sinner and Alexander Zverev. One of those questions has proven timely. Zverev asked Djokovic: “Novak, are you finally going to let me win a Slam myself?” Of course the two-time Nitto ATP Finals champion was joking, and he was not the only player who asked a similar question. “Come on guys! I don’t know what to say,” Djokovic said, cracking a laugh. “I’m going to have to disappoint all of you, because you’re going to see quite a bit of me in the next several years. I have big plans. I have still a lot to win.” Zverev will hope some of that winning does not come at his expense on Friday. If the 27-year-old is to claim his first major title at the Australian Open, he will need to battle past Djokovic in the semi-finals. Djokovic leads the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series 8-4, including 3-0 at Grand Slam tournaments. Their most recent clash at a major came in the 2021 US Open semi-finals, where Djokovic needed five sets to triumph. To see the other questions ATP stars asked Djokovic and how the 37-year-old responded, watch the full feature at the top of the article. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
