  "description": "Andrey Rublev cemented his status as a two-time champion at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open in Doha on Saturday. The fifth seed resisted a resurgence from Jack Draper in the final at the hard-court ATP 500 to prevail 7-5, 5-7, 6-1. Rublev, who also earned an ATP 250 triumph in the city in 2020, kept his cool in a heavy-hitting clash and struck 34 winners en route to sealing his 17th ATP Tour trophy. It was his first tour-level title since he won the ATP Masters 1000 in Madrid last May. “It feels amazing,” said Rublev. “It’s my first ever title that I won twice.. I’m really happy. I think both of us were really tired after two three-set matches that finished late. We were exhausted and it was difficult, but somehow we were able to play at a good level. When I lost the second set, I let it go and started to play more freely. “I played at a good level. In some moments, I was really good mentally and didn't let frustration get over me. As soon as I was frustrated, I was able to restart again and I was able to play at the same intensity. That’s the most important thing.” Rublo at the double in Doha! 😛2020 champion @AndreyRublev97 captures a 17th title 🏆 the 1st time he's won an event multiple times!@QatarTennis | #QatarExxonMobilOpen pic.twitter.com/HexbkV6Rha— ATP Tour (@atptour) February 22, 2025 With his two-hour, four-minute victory, Rublev earned his sixth ATP 500 title. Now with 31 wins at that level since the start of the 2023 season, the 27-year-old trails only Alex de Minaur (35) and Jannik Sinner (32) for most on Tour in that period. Rublev's ATP 500 titles    Hamburg  2020  St. Petersburg  2020  Vienna  2020  Rotterdam   2021  Dubai   2022  Doha  2025 A run to the championship match in Doha ensured Draper will rise to a new career high of No. 12 in the PIF ATP Rankings on Monday. The Briton, who was chasing his third ATP Tour title, dug deep to spark hopes of a third consecutive comeback win, but he was ultimately unable to conjure a response to Rublev’s power and precision. “It’s been an amazing week,” said Draper. “Andrey was too good today. We played some tough matches this week and in the third set he was just a bit too strong for me. I’m really proud of my efforts this week. Every day, I wake up and try to improve, so it’s a testament to my hard work I suppose.” According to TDI Insights, Draper entered Saturday’s final in Doha with a Steal Score of 43 per cent for the tournament, highlighting the impressive defensive prowess he has garnered a reputation for. In a bid to start on the front foot, however, Draper displayed a more aggressive attitude from the outset against Rublev. Yet this approach only favoured the World No. 10, who was able to absorb Draper’s pace with ease and fire the ball back with venom. Draper’s first double fault of the contest was untimely, bringing up three set points for Rublev, who converted the third of them with his sixth forehand winner of the opening set. The 27-year-old’s clinical serving was also key in the early stages. He won 94 per cent (17/18) of points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and dropped just two on his serve overall during the first set. Having rallied to victory in consecutive matches to reach the final, Draper dug deep once more. The British No. 1 saved both of the break points he faced in the second set and drastically improved his Return Quality from 5.2 in the first set to 9.2, eventually breaking Rublev for the first time to force a decider. Rublev, however, regrouped in clinical fashion, picking off Draper with a backhand return winner to break early in the final set before racing across the line. Rublev, who will return to No. 9 in the PIF ATP Rankings on Monday, improved to 4-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Draper. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
