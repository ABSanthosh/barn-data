  "description": "Live electronic line calling will be used at Wimbledon from 2025, the tournament announced on Wednesday. The officiating technology will be in place for all main draw and qualifying match courts, covering the ‘out’ and ‘fault’ calls that have previously been made by line judges. The decision to adopt live ELC was made following the successful completion of extensive testing during this year’s Championships.[ATP APP] “The decision to introduce live electronic line calling at The Championships was made following a significant period of consideration and consultation,” said Sally Bolton, Chief Executive of the All England Club. “Having reviewed the results of the testing undertaken at The Championships this year, we consider the technology to be sufficiently robust and the time is right to take this important step in seeking maximum accuracy in our officiating. For the players, it will offer them the same conditions they have played under at a number of other events on tour.” The grass-court major also announced a provisional schedule for the final weekend. The men’s doubles finals will commence at 1 p.m. Saturday, followed by the women’s singles final at 4 p.m. On Sunday, the men’s singles final will take place at 4 p.m., an hour later than previous years' championship matches. The schedule for the singles semi-finals will not change and the mixed doubles final will continue to be provisionally scheduled for the third match on the second Thursday. Wimbledon 2025 runs from 30 June-13 July.[NEWSLETTER FORM]",
