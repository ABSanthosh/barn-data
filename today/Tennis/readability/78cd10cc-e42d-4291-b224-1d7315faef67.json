  "text": "The first day of fourth-round action at Wimbledon 2025 saw Cameron Norrie delivered a gutsy five-set win over qualifier Nicolas Jarry in the match of the day, keeping British hopes alive under the closed roof of No. 1 Court. Carlos Alcaraz overcame a slow start to dispatch Andrey Rublev, while Taylor Fritz and Karen Khachanov both advanced with minimal fuss. Norrie needed four hours and 27 minutes to grind through Jarry’s serve-heavy assault, while Alcaraz showed flashes of brilliance to turn his clash with Rublev around after dropping the opener. Elsewhere, Fritz advanced after Jordan Thompson retired with a back injury, and Khachanov quietly continues his impressive grass-court form. With the quarter-finals now taking shape, the race for the men’s title is heating up, here’s everything that went down on Day Seven at SW19. Day Seven Wimbledon 2025 Round of 16 Results Winner Loser Scoreline Taylor Fritz (5) Jordan Thompson 6-1 3-0 RET Karen Khachanov (17) Kamil Majchrzak 6-4 6-2 6-3 Cameron Norrie Nicolas Jarry (Q) 6-3 7-6(4) 5-7(7) 6-7(5) 6-3 Carlos Alcaraz (2) Andrey Rublev (14) 6-7(5) 6-3 6-4 6-4 Norrie Outlasts Jarry Cameron Norrie kept British hopes alive at Wimbledon on Sunday, clawing past Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry in a 6-3, 7-6(4), 6-7(7), 6-7(5), 6-3 battle on No. 1 Court to secure his second career quarter-final at The Championships. Norrie is a former top 10 but has had a couple of poor seasons, however, his attitude rarely wavers from fighting for every ball an,d buoyed by a roaring crowd under the closed roof, overcame squandered match points in the third-set tiebreak and a 4-2 lead in the fourth-set breaker to triumph after 4 hours and 27 minutes. Jarry, who came through qualifying before stunning Holger Rune in the first round, pushed Norrie to the brink with his booming serve and heavy baseline game, and he was arguably the better player for significant periods of the encounter. Yet he found himself down two sets. He went on to save match point in the third-set tiebreak with a massive serve-forehand combo and clawing back from 2-4 in the fourth set tie break to force a decider, but Norrie’s relentless defence and unrivalled cardio proved the difference. Honestly, I don’t know how I did that. Credit to Nico [Nicolas Jarry]. He did an unbelievable job. He played better than me in both tie-breaks [that he lost]. I had to keep fighting. I forgot to get my coach a birthday present today, so I had to get the win for him! “He hung in there but I kept taking care of my serve. The atmosphere was so good and I appreciate the crowd getting me through. Norrie on his win. Alcaraz Rallies Past Rublev Carlos Alcaraz weathered an early blip on Sunday evening, before firing back to clinch a 6-7(5), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 victory to reach the quarter-finals. Rublev broke early in the first without really doing too much, but Alcaraz broke back and lead 5-3 in the breaker only to see Rublev to reel of four straight points to take it. Neither player really hit the heights in the opener but Alcaraz won more points, hit more winners and made less unforced errors so you never got the impression he was in trouble and only needed to raise his level slightly to restablish control. That’s pretty much what happened and he converted his sole break point in the second set to level. In the third the highligh came at 3-3, 30/40 when Alcaraz, stretched wide, ripped a jaw-dropping forehand passing shot to break Rublev’s serve after the Russian thought he had played a perfect point. The fourth was a similar story with another sole break making the difference and Rublev never got a look in to get back on level terms. Alcaraz only lost serve once (early in the first) and while it wasn’t as clinical as Djoker and Sinner’s win’s yesterday he still played well in periods and his match stats are decent. If Rublev could offer up some variety it might have been more interesting but any time he ventured to the net he never looked like winning a point up there. Andrey is one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful player that we have on Tour. Without a doubt, with how aggressive he is to the ball, with that forehand, with those shots, it’s really difficult. To face him, you feel like he’s pushing you to the limit with every ball, [making you] run side to side. That makes it really difficult to face him, but I’m just really happy with the way I moved today. I think I played intelligently and smart today against him. Tactically it was a really good match, which I am really proud about. Alcaraz on his win. Other Notable Matches Taylor Fritz (5) def. Jordan Thompson 6-1, 3-0 Retired Taylor Fritz cruised into his third Wimbledon quarter-final on Sunday, as Jordan Thompson retired trailing 6-1, 3-0 on No. 1 Court, citing back pain.  Fritz will be glad to spend just 40 minutes on court after his back-to-back five-setters in the opening two rounds. Had Thomspn been fit I think he could have got a set as he’s a decent grass courter but I still give Fritz the edge. “It’s tough to advance like this. Jordan’s been grinding through five-setters and doubles, so massive respect for him fighting despite his body giving out. I wish him a speedy recovery. It is not the way I want to go through. I was really excited to play Jordan today. I was excited to play some good tennis and it is just sad. He has been battling. He has been playing five-setters. He was out playing a long doubles match yesterday, so he has been battling out here. Respect to him for coming out. His body is not right, so I feel bad for him and hope he feels better. Fritz on his win. Karen Khachanov def. Kamil Majchrzak 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 Karen Khachanov powered into the Wimbledon quarter-finals with a clinical 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 dismantling of Polish qualifier Kamil Majchrzak on No. 2 Court.  Khachanov is often underrated, as he consistently finds himself near the business end of tournaments he enters. After rallying from 2-5 down in the fifth set against Nuno Borges in the third round, he didn’t show any sign of fatigue, firing 44 winners to just 21 unforced errors and breaking serve six times in a swift 1 hour and 48 minutes. Khachanov entered SW19 with a Halle semi-final run, and he has been serving exceptionally well, giving him a realistic shot at taking out Fritz.

I was excited to play some good tennis and it is just sad. He has been battling. He has been playing five-setters. He was out playing a long doubles match yesterday, so he has been battling out here. Respect to him for coming out. His body is not right, so I feel bad for him and hope he feels better. \u003ccite\u003eFritz on his win.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKaren Khachanov def.

Kamil Majchrzak on No. 2 Court. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhachanov is often underrated, as he consistently finds himself near the business end of tournaments he enters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter rallying from 2-5 down in the fifth set against Nuno Borges in the third round, he didn’t show any sign of fatigue, firing 44 winners to just 21 unforced errors and breaking serve six times in a swift 1 hour and 48 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhachanov entered SW19 with a Halle semi-final run, and he has been serving exceptionally well, giving him a realistic shot at taking out Fritz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWimbledon 2025 Day Eight Round of 16 Matches\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\"
