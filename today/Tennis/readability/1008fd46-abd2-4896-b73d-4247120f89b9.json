  "text": "Italy claimed their first Billie Jean King Cup title in 11 years as Jasmine Paolini wrapped up a 2-0 win over Slovakia in Malaga.Paolini, who has enjoyed a breakthrough 2024 season, was part of the Italian team that finished runners-up to Canada 12 months ago.The world number four won 6-2 6-1 against Rebecca Sramkova after Lucia Bronzetti had put Italy ahead with a 6-2 6-4 victory over Viktoria Hruncakova in the first singles match.\"I always dreamed about this trophy,\" said Bronzetti, who was playing just her second singles match in the competition.\"We are the world champions, we can be much happier. It is a dream of all of ours and we are so proud.\"Italy, who will earn $2.4m (£1.9m) in prize money for winning their fifth title, have become a tennis powerhouse recently, with the men's team - led by world number one Jannik Sinner - winning its first Davis Cup in 47 years in 2023.\"I think it's an unbelievable year for Italian tennis and it's so good for our sport in our country,\" Paolini told reporters.\"We have a lot of fans of tennis in Italy now, tennis is growing a lot.\"Captain Tathiana Garbin said: \"It's a dream come true. I have such great champions, great players, and great human beings. \"I am so proud of them. They fight every day.\"Slovakia, who knocked Great Britain out on Tuesday, were playing in their first final since they won the tournament in 2002.Paolini was ranked 30th when she was defeated by Canada's Leylah Fernandez in last year's final, while she had never advanced past the second round of a major.But the 28-year-old has enjoyed a stellar 2024, reaching the final of the French Open and Wimbledon before winning Olympic doubles gold in Paris with Sara Errani.Paolini held her arms aloft and skipped joyfully around the court with her team-mates as she delivered the title for Italy. \"An unbelievable year, a crazy year. To finish like this with a title in the Billie Jean King Cup is amazing. I don't have words to describe it,\" Paolini said.Sramkova, ranked 43rd, had been in scintillating form over the past week, triumphing over world number 11 Danielle Collins of the USA before fighting back to beat British number one Katie Boulter. But she struggled against Paolini, who took advantage of the Slovak's 28 unforced errors and won four successive games to seal victory.Her win ensured Italy did not need a deciding doubles match in the best-of-three series and denied Errani a 50th Billie Jean King Cup appearance.Paolini added: \"I'm trying just to enjoy every moment because its important also to understand where you are and I feel lucky to be in this position, I feel lucky to be part of this team. \"I think we played an unbelievable week and I'm really happy this year that we could bring the trophy home again.\"",
