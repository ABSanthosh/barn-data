  "description": "Mark Darby, a longtime member of the tennis family who served the ATP Tour as a supervisor from 1990 until his retirement in 2017, passed away Friday at his home in Florida at the age of 68. A proud father of triplets — Caroline, Connor and Ryan — Darby dedicated his life to tennis and made an immeasurable impact on the sport through his knowledge, integrity and dedication to helping those around him. Known for his composure and attention to detail at tournaments, no aspect of an event was too small for Darby to help ensure the best possible experience for all involved. Above all, he was a mentor and a friend to countless people throughout the industry. Darby was a distinguished tennis player himself, having played for Pennsylvania State University, qualifying for the NCAA Championships in 1978. He climbed into the Top 500 in both the PIF ATP Rankings and the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings. But the Rochester-born Darby made his mark as an official, who developed a reputation as a humble man whose work spoke for him and the results of those efforts earned respect around the world from players, tournaments and other members of the tennis community. Darby spent a brief stint as a supervisor for the USTA, also serving as deputy referee for the US Open, before beginning his career at the ATP Tour.

Former World No. 4 Todd Martin, who after his playing career became a tournament director, reflected on Darby’s legacy upon hearing the news. “Mark Darby was proof that tennis players weren’t the only ferocious competitors on the ATP Tour,” Martin said. “His competitiveness revealed itself in pursuing fairness for each Tour Member and relentlessly exploring the issues a relative start-up league needed to solve. ‘Darbs’ also had a strong tennis game and fairly sharp elbows when battling for rebounds in early morning pick-up basketball games. “His poise accented by a subtle chuckle in response to both astute observations and inane complaints was disarming, especially for those of us who had shared the basketball court with him. Mark exuded authenticity in all he did. We have lost a great man in Mark Darby.” The former Penn State Nittany Lion was proud of his alma mater and also was a big basketball fan who loved the Los Angeles Lakers and chatting with colleagues and friends about the wider sports world. Outside of his successful career as an official, Darby was a family man who cared greatly about his children. In 2017, with his triplets in high school, the long-time supervisor retired to maximise the time he was able to spend with his children. Darby remained connected to the tennis world, serving as the referee in Miami following his retirement from the ATP Tour. He also returned to the US Open as deputy referee in 2018. ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi said: “Mark was a stalwart of the ATP officiating community for decades, earning immense respect through his expertise and unwavering commitment to the sport. His impact on the game and those around him was profound — not just as an official but as a mentor and friend. “Mark was a constant presence during my own playing career, commanding the utmost respect from everyone in the game. His legacy will endure in the standards he set and the many officials he helped guide along the way. We are deeply saddened by his passing, and our thoughts are with his family and loved ones during this difficult time. Rest in peace, Mark.\"",
