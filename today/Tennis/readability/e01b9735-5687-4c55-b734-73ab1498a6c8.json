  "text": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jack Draper has risen to a career-high seventh in the world rankingsBritish number one Jack Draper lost in straight sets to Jakub Mensik at the Miami Open in his first match since lifting the Indian Wells title.The 23-year-old, who has risen to a career-high seventh in the world rankings, was beaten 7-6 (7-2) 7-6 (7-3) by his Czech opponent in the second round.Draper made a fine start, breaking Mensik with the first game of the match, but the 19-year-old levelled at 3-3 and was on top from then on.The world number 54 sent down 21 aces, including four in taking the first-set tie-break.There were angry scenes during the second set when it was announced Brazilian Joao Fonseca's match against France's Ugo Humbert, which was due on next, had been moved to the main court.The Brazilian fans, some of whom had been in the stands for hours, booed as they left their seats to make their way to the other court, where their favourite overcame Humbert 6-4 6-3.Draper, who was leading 4-3, attempted to restart but asked the umpire to stop play because of the jeers.When play eventually resumed the set stayed with serve to force another tie-break, which Mensik took to reach the third round of a ATP Masters 1000 event for the third time in his career.British number three Jacob Fearnley, 23, also went out after a crushing straight-set defeat by top seed Alexander Zverev.The German, who also beat the Scot in straight sets at the Australian Open, needed just one hour, 14 minutes to wrap up a 6-2 6-4 victory.Despite the defeat, Fearnley will climb above Cameron Norrie to become British number two - behind Draper - when the ATP rankings are updated after Miami.Elsewhere, 20-year-old Coleman Wong of Hong Kong secured the first top-20 win of his career with a 7-6 (7-3) 2-6 7-6 (7-5) victory over American world number 14 Ben Shelton.American third seed Taylor Fritz eased through to the next round with a 7-6 (7-2) 6-3 win over beat Lorenzo Sonego of Italy.More on this story",
