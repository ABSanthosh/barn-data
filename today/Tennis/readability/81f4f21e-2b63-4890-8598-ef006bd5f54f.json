  "text": "Daria Kasatkina says she feels \"emotional\" after switching allegiance from Russia to Australia but \"didn't have much choice\" after publicly criticising her country's LGBTQ+ laws and the war in Ukraine.Kasatkina has been living in Dubai and has not returned to Russia in two and a half years.The 27-year-old had her application for permanent residency accepted last week and will represent Australia for the first time at this week's Charleston Open in South Carolina.\"It's my first official day as an Australian player. Honestly, it feels different, I'm not going to lie. It's emotional for me,\" said the world number 12.\"I have to get used to it. But I'm really happy to start this new chapter of my life representing Australia on the big stage.\"Kasatkina revealed her sexuality in a video interview in 2022 before leaving Russia, which has strict laws on LGBTQ+ rights.After also criticising the war in Ukraine in the interview, a Russian politician unsuccessfully called for her to be listed as a 'foreign agent' - someone acting against Russian interests.Last year, she said she was expecting \"consequences\" following her actions.\"With everything going on in my previous country, I didn't have much choice [to switch allegiance],\" she told reporters on Monday.\"For me, being openly gay, if I want to be myself, I have to make this step, and I did it.\"I have to get used to it a little bit, because for a couple of years I didn't hear anything. But it's something nice to get used to.\"Natela Dzalamidze and Alexander Shevchenko are among other Russia-born tennis players to switch nationality in recent years, now representing Georgia and Kazakhstan respectively.",
