  "text": "The opening day of Wimbledon 2025 set the All England Club alight with a record-breaking 31.4¬∞C heatwave and a flurry of upsets that rocked the men‚Äôs draw. From Benjamin Bonzi‚Äôs stunning takedown of ninth seed Daniil Medvedev to Valentin Royer capitalising on Stefanos Tsitsipas‚Äô injury-forced retirement, Day 1 delivered plenty of upsets. Nicolas Jarry pulled off a dramatic five-set upset against eighth seed Holger Rune, rallying from two sets down to secure his place in the second round. Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz endured a gruelling five-set battle against Fabio Fognini, and qualifiers like Kamil Majchrzak and wildcards like Arthur Fery toppled seeds, setting a tone of unpredictability that will likely run into tomorrow‚Äôs first-round matches from the top half of the draw. Three matches, featuring Taylor Fritz vs. Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, Matteo Arnaldi vs. Botic van de Zandschulp, and Shintaro Mochizuki vs. Giulio Zeppieri, were suspended due to fading light and will conclude tomorrow. Full results and recap below.

I wasn‚Äôt sure what to make of Medvedev, as he‚Äôs shown this year that he can lose to anyone. However, he played well in Halle to reach the final, and given that he‚Äôd made the last four at SW19 for the past two years, I thought he‚Äôd be able to make an impression. However, the World No. 64 Frenchman outplayed him to inflict another early round defeat at a Grand Slam after Learner Tien at the Australian Open and Cameron Norrie at Roland Garros. I would be very worried if not for the Halle tournament, where I played well and managed to reach the final, playing at a high level. That‚Äôs why I can compare today‚Äôs match to this tournament. I feel like I didn‚Äôt play much worse. The court is a bit different. It‚Äôs a tiny bit slower with the heat, also. But every shot I played today, even good shots, he had an answer. I was supposed to play him or Halys in Halle. I watched the match. He couldn‚Äôt play two balls in the court. Not two in a row. I was surprised. I was like, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôll be tough against Quentin.‚Äô I played good. I won. Today, he barely missed‚Äîa little on the forehand. The backhand, I remember maybe three unforced errors. I wish he would play like this. I saw the draw. If he plays how he did today, he‚Äôs definitely in the 4th round. Then it‚Äôs Fritz. Then it‚Äôs tougher. But I would not be surprised if he doesn‚Äôt play like this. Medvedev on his loss. Tsitsipas Retires Stefanos Tsitsipas‚Äô Wimbledon campaign ended at the first hurdle on Monday, forced to retire with a back injury trailing French qualifier Valentin Royer 6-3, 6-2 in his opener.¬† The Greek entered Wimbledon with his new coach Goran Ivanisevic in tow, but he showed discomfort during the 74-minute clash. A medical timeout in the second set couldn‚Äôt salvage his cause, with Tsitsipas landing just 43% of first serves and struggling to move freely. I‚Äôd seen on social media that his practice sessions were hardly pedal to the metal type stuff so it‚Äôs not a huge surprise, but I guess he tried to prevail with ‚Äúwhat few tools he has‚Äù üòÅ Royer now faces compatriot Adrian Mannarino for a third-round spot. It‚Äôs probably the most difficult situation that I‚Äôve ever been faced with, because it‚Äôs an ongoing issue that doesn‚Äôt seem to be disappearing or fading off as much,‚Äù Tsitsipas added on his back issues. Myself, as a person, I have a limit at some point, so I‚Äôll definitely have to have my final answer on whether I want to do stuff or not in the next couple of months. This is going to be hard, but if I see it going in that trajectory, there is no point at competing. If I‚Äôm not healthy, and I‚Äôve talked about health so many times, if health is not there, then your whole tennis life becomes miserable. Tsitsipas on his injury. Alcaraz Fends Off Fogini in Five-Set Scare Two-time defending Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz battled through a record-breaking 31.4¬∞C opening day to defeat Fabio Fognini 7-5, 6-7(5), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 in a four-hour, 37-minute Centre Court encounter. I think the last time I saw Fognini play on grass was when Federer took him apart back in 2012. Considering he has zero tour wins since last October, I expected Carlos to produce a similar straight-set scoreline. However, Fognini, in his final Wimbledon appearance, threw in plenty of surprises as Alcaraz struggled to deal with his flat hitting, deft touch, and all-around court craft. However, his fitness arguably proved the difference as he preserved his 18-0 major first-round record and 15-match Wimbledon win streak, landing 15 aces, winning 78% of first-serve points (62/80), and converting 4 of 7 break points, hitting 52 winners against 62 unforced errors. Alcaraz saved all five break points in the first set, breaking Fognini at 5-5 with a pinpoint lob to clinch 7-5. Fognini levelled in the second-set tie-break, capitalising on Alcaraz‚Äôs forehand error to win 7-6(5). The third set saw Fognini‚Äôs highlight-reel dive and backhand volley to break for 3-5, but Alcaraz broke back as he reeled off four straight games to take a 2-set to 1 lead. Fognini dominated the fourth 6-2 with 14 winners, but Alcaraz, aided by a lengthy delay due to a medical issue in the stands that saw Fognini stiffen up, surged in the fifth, breaking twice (2-0, 4-1), and closing with a 138 mph ace for 6-1. He next faces British qualifier Oliver Tarvet, who beat Leandro Riedi 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs his last Wimbledon, because with the level he has shown, he can still play three or four more years. I have to give him credit for such a great match. Fabio is such a great player, he has shown in his whole career the level he has. I‚Äôm just a little bit sad that it‚Äôs his last Wimbledon, but happy to have shared the court with him. Playing the first match on Centre Court is never easy. I have been playing on grass pretty well, but Wimbledon is special. I can feel the difference between Wimbledon and the other tournaments. I just try to play the best I could, but I would say it could be better. I have to improve. Alcaraz on his win. Other Notable Matches Nicolas Jarry (Q) def. Holger Rune (8) 4-6, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 Another big upset, and one I thought was possible given how Jarry had breezed through qualifying and Rune‚Äôs tendency to get dragged into long matches. Jarry delivered 31 aces and won 79% of first-serve points (66/84), converting 4 of 11 break points. Rune managed 10 aces but faltered with a 65% first-serve percentage (50/77) and converted only 2 of 4 break points. Jarry‚Äôs 50 winners to 28 unforced errors edged Rune‚Äôs 42 winners to 35 unforced errors. Down two sets, Jarry shifted momentum by breaking Rune in the 12th game of the third set to avoid a tie-break. His aggressive forehand and net play dominated the fourth, and a critical break in the fifth set at 4-4, followed by a hold under pressure, clinched the upset. Rune said in the press that he has a knee injury and under normal circumstances he would win this match 9 out of 10 times. Does he need to tell us that?¬† Arthur Fery (WC) def. Alexei Popyrin (20) 6-4, 6-1, 4-6, 6-4 Fery dominated the second set with a double break, showcasing crisp volleys and strong serving. Popyrin fought back to take the third set by breaking Fery at 5-4, but the Brit regrouped, securing a decisive break in the fourth set at 5-4 to close out the match. The home crowd‚Äôs support was a factor as Fery notched his biggest career win against the 20th seed, Nuno Borges def. Francisco Cerundolo (16) 4-6, 6-3, 7-6(5), 6-0 Stats: Borges struck nine aces and won 75% of first-serve points (58/75), converting 6 of 14 break points. Cerundolo has only ever won 1 match at Wimbledon in 4 attempts, and he couldn‚Äôt continue his solid play from the first half of the year. Kamil Majchrzak def. Matteo Berrettini (32) 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3 Kamil Majchrzak knocked out 2021 Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini in a five-set battle to record his first ever win at SW19. The Pole dropped the first set but dominated the second and third with aggressive baseline play, only for Berrettini to claw back in the fourth, forcing a decider which Majchrzak comfortably took. I was half-thinking Berrettini would be able to put together a run, as his game suits grass, but he‚Äôs barely played in recent weeks, with his last two tournaments on clay ending in retirements before he missed the French. Jenson Brooksby def. Tallon Griekspoor (31) 6-2, 7-5, 6-3 Jenson Brooksby delivered a commanding performance to dispatch the 31st seed Tallon Griekspoor in straight sets Both were in action on the weekend, with Griekspoor winning Mallorca and Brooksby taking the runners-up trophy to Fritz in Eastbourne. However, it was the American who came out on top here; his game is not easy to deal with, and he seemed to have a handle on Griekspoor‚Äôs serve, which is his main weapon. Andrey Rublev (14) def. Laslo Djere 6-0, 7-6(5), 6-7(9), 7-6(6) Andrey Rublev came through a tough four-set battle against Laslo Djere, avoiding an upset with a dominant display and some tie-break drama. The 14th seed obliterated Djere in the first set with a bagel, but the Serb fought back, pushing the second and third sets to tie-breaks, stealing the third after saving match point. Rublev‚Äôs aggressive baseline game shone in the fourth-set tie-break, where he clinched the match with a decisive volley.
