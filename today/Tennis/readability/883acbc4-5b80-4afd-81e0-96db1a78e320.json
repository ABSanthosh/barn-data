This year, the American is two victories from claiming his maiden tour-level title on clay at the same event. The top seed advanced to the semi-finals of the Fayez Sarofim \u0026 Co. U.S. Men’s Clay Court championship on Friday with a 6-1, 7-6(1) triumph against qualifier Colton Smith. “I came out playing my really well. I think maybe he was a little nervous and gave me a few free points, but then he locked it in there in the second set,” Paul said in his on-court interview. “Both of us played high level. I'm glad we got to play a great match in front of you guys.” Next stop 🔜 Houston semi-finals! 🙌@TommyPaul1 gets past Smith 6-1 7-6(1).@mensclaycourt | #USClay pic.twitter.com/PC09NDY19W — ATP Tour (@atptour) April 4, 2025 Paul has become friends with Smith, who is still a student-athlete at the University of Arizona. They even went fishing together earlier in the week. But on the court, it was the four-time ATP Tour titlist Paul who showed his experience in a one, hour, 29-minute victory. Despite landing just 47 per cent of his serves, the winner claimed 80 per cent of his service points overall according to Infosys ATP Stats. The No. 13 player in the PIF ATP Rankings started the week with a 2-3 record in the Houston ATP 250.But he has made a huge jump in level since his debut at the tournament nearly a decade ago. “I just have a little bit more experience,” Paul said. “I’ve been out here a little longer, and it took me a really long time to make my first semi-final here. But I feel like we've made a lot of improvements in my game, and I'm excited for the next matchup.”   That clash will be with qualifier Jenson Brooksby, who rallied past Aleksandar Kovacevic 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 in two hours and 21 minutes. The World No. 507 had already escaped match point in two matches — one in each of qualifying and the main draw. “I think I was able to really stay calm and crawl back like in my previous matches, just regroup,” said Brooksby, who will try to earn his first Lexus ATP Head2Head win against Paul. “And it made all the difference today.” The All-American quarter-finals continued when Brandon Nakashima eliminated Christopher Eubanks 6-4, 6-4 behind a dominant serving performance. The fourth seed won 74 per cent of his second-serve points and did not face a break point against Eubanks. Nakashima, who will next try to make his first clay-court ATP Tour final, is up to No. 31 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. “I thought it was a very good performance from me,” Nakashima said. “Very difficult conditions out here today and with Chris there are not going to be many rallies and you know he’s going to hit some good serves, so just tried to take care of my serve and I’m happy the way I played.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
