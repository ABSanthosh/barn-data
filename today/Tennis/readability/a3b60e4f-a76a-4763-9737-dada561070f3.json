  "text": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Oliver Tarvet previously defeated top-250 players Terence Atmane and Alexis Galarneau in the first two qualifying roundsBritain's world number 719 Oliver Tarvet has reached the Wimbledon singles main draw - which will contain the highest number of home players for 41 years.Tarvet upset Belgian world number 144 Alexander Blockx 6-3 3-6 6-2 6-1 in the final round of qualifying on Thursday.It was the 21-year-old's first time playing a best-of-five match.Tarvet's victory means there will be 23 British players - 13 men and 10 women - in the singles draw when Wimbledon begins on 30 June.That is the most since 1984, when there were nine men and 14 women.The Englishman, who is from St Albans, competes on the US collegiate circuit and has one year left of his studies at the University of San Diego.Most college sports in America are strictly amateur, so Tarvet will be unable to claim the vast majority of his £66,000 prize money for reaching the Wimbledon first round.\"There's a lot of emotions, but the main one is just happiness,\" Tarvet said.\"Ever since I was a little kid, it's been my dream.\"Tarvet defeated top-250 players Terence Atmane of France and Canadian Alexis Galarneau in the first two rounds of qualifying.Earlier on Thursday, British world number 550 Hamish Stewart fell 6-3 4-6 6-3 6-4 to Swiss Leandro Riedi.Emily Appleton also missed out on a main-draw spot, losing 6-2 2-6 6-0 to Veronika Erjavec of Slovenia.'I might be flying my coach home by private jet'Tarvet's prize money situation is not unheard of.Last year, Australian Maya Joint forfeited more than $200,000 (£145,000) in prize money, external after reaching the second round of the US Open while still an amateur at the University of Texas.Student-athletes are allowed to claim up to $10,000 (£7,300) per year from any prize money, which goes towards expenses and entrance fees.\"It's a little bit awkward because I've got to find a lot of expenses and I really want to come back to University of San Diego to complete my fourth year,\" Tarvet said.\"What they've done for me is just incredible and I'm so grateful. I want to spend my fourth year there and really leave my mark on US history.\"I can claim up to $10,000 so I might be flying my coach on a private jet at home.\"Tarvet 'unlikely to change his plans'Analysis by BBC tennis correspondent Russell FullerQualifying for the main draw of Wimbledon is unlikely to change Tarvet's plans for the year ahead.He is said to be keen to complete his degree and play a final year on the phenomenally competitive US college circuit.He was ranked in the top five division one singles players in this year's NCAA Championships, having won 23 of his 25 matches.Tarvet has only played two professional tournaments this year, but won one of them - a $15,000 ITF World Tour event which took place in San Diego.The world number 719 has already accumulated five titles in his very short career - all of which have been on the lowest rung of the professional ladder.Before this experience, $25,000 is the largest prize fund he has ever competed for. The total prize pot at Wimbledon is £53.5m.More on this story",
