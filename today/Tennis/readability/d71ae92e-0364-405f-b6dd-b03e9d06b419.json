Fonseca, the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion, believes that his success in Jeddah has propelled him into a new era of confidence.  \"When I arrived here [in Melbourne], my goal was to qualify for the main draw,\" said Fonseca, who is on a 14-match win streak at all levels. \"Of course, my expectations are bigger now. I want more and more. [To] want more and more - that's the mentality of a champion. Of course I am very happy with the way that I played today, but I am already thinking about the next match. It's going to be against a very great player [Lorenzo Sonego]. \"The Next Gen ATP Finals gave me confidence. I'm playing great tennis, so I need to enjoy this moment, to play my best.\" The 18-year-old Brazilian was an undefeated champion in Jeddah, capturing a tournament-record prize money of $526,480. He defeated Arthur Fils and Jakub Mensik en route to the title.  At times during his first-round clash against Rublev, people would have been forgiven for mistaking Fonseca as the Top 10 star on Margaret Court Arena. The qualifier's bruising ballstriking evoked audible gasps from the crowd as he struck 51 winners in the 7-6(1), 6-3, 7-6(5) victory, according to Infosys.   Although his experience pales in comparison to 10-time major quarter-finalist Rublev, Fonseca was undeterred.  \"I was trying to enter the court [knowing that] 'I'm an 18-year-old, he's a Top 10 guy',\" Fonseca added. \"I am going to do my best. Of course, I was confident, I know I can win. But no pressure on myself.  \"That's what I was trying to do, but when I was two-sets-to-love up, I was thinking a little bit more [that] maybe I was going to win this match. I needed to focus, keep pushing. The nerves came, but mentally I stayed.\" The 18-year-old is only the second teenager since 1973 to defeat a Top 10 opponent in their maiden Grand Slam main-draw match after Mario Ancic beat Roger Federer at Wimbledon in 2002.
