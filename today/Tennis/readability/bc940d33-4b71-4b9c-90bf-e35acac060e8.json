Even if she doesn’t realise yet, hopefully she will come and watch a little bit. “Sometimes you have doubts about your fitness and your head. If you're not 100 per cent there, mentally, it’s tough to compete with those guys - the level is so high. I have put a lot of hard work in [over] the past few months and there is no [surprise] the tennis came back and I am really happy to be back again in the quarter-finals of an ATP Masters 1000.” [ATP APP] Goffin, who was hampered by injuries following the 2021 US Open, has shown glimpses of his best tennis over the past few months. After making the semi-finals at the Winston-Salem Open, Goffin produced a strong run to the third round at Flushing Meadows. This week in Shanghai, Goffin ousted 15th seed Lorenzo Musetti in a thrilling battle before denying Zverev in his quest for a second title in 2024. “I have built confidence from the beginning of the tournament. Match after match, I was playing better and I just came on the court and tried to play my best tennis,” added Goffin. “[I tried] to stick to the plan that I had with my coach and it worked. Even though he came back with some good rallies, I just tried to stay positive because I was on the right way to winning the match. It paid off in the end with a really good service game to finish, so I am really happy with the win.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
