  "text": "Britain's Jacob Fearnley saw his 13-match winning streak come to an end with defeat by Dutch opponent Tallon Griekspoor at the Stockholm Open.Qualifier Fearnley was beaten 7-6 (7-0) 6-3 by world number 37 Griekspoor in the second round of the ATP 250 event.The 23-year-old Scot, who is ranked 99th, was looking to record the best win by ranking of his burgeoning professional career.A remarkable rise has seen Fearnley quickly climb into the world's top 100 - having been ranked 646th at the start of this year - since graduating from university in the United States.A close first set saw the British men's number three lead by a break before the heavy pressure on his serve told when Griekspoor broke back to love for 4-4. Seventh seed Griekspoor dominated a one-sided tie-break and, after looking solid on his own serve, broke twice from 3-3 in the second set to seal victory. Despite being unable to beat a top-40 player for the first time, Fearnley looks likely to consolidate his place in the top 100 after a fine week in the Swedish capital.Stepping up to the top-level ATP Tour, Fearnley won two qualifying matches before beating tricky Frenchman Corentin Moutet in the first round of the main draw to reach the last 16.The three victories in Stockholm came on the back of two successive titles on the Challenger Tour, which is the tier of events below the main tour.Fearnley hopes to earn a spot in the qualifying draw for the upcoming ATP indoor event in Swiss city Basel next week.His aim over the coming weeks is securing his place in the top 100 and earning direct entry into January's Australian Open as a result.Elsewhere on Wednesday, Britain's Harriet Dart lost 6-3 6-2 against Denmark's Clara Tauson in a WTA 250 event in Osaka, Japan.Dart, 28, reached a career-high of 70th last month and is looking to finish an encouraging season strongly.",
