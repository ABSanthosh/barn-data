  "text": "Second Serve: Your new weekly tennis briefingIn the first edition of Second Serve, a weekly snapshot of the tennis tour, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko looks at the success stories from Indian Wells.Mirra Andreeva had an important apology to make right after winning the Indian Wells title.Looking to her coaching team, she said sorry for being \"as you like to say, a little brat\" before her match against world number one Aryna Sabalenka.It's easy to forget Andreeva is just 17. She is playing with the maturity of a seasoned professional - and already cleaning up at some of the biggest tournaments on the WTA Tour.Having become the youngest player to win a WTA 1000 event when she triumphed in Dubai last month, she continued her form in Indian Wells and lifted the trophy on Sunday with her 12th successive victory.Impressive, right? But her achievement is made even more remarkable by the fact she beat Iga Swiatek and Sabalenka - the world's top two players - over the weekend.The way she regrouped after dropping the second set 6-1 to Swiatek was impressive, as was her mental fortitude after losing the first set of the final against Sabalenka.No wonder the prodigiously talented teenager is being tipped as a future world number one - and Grand Slam champion.Talk naturally leads to which Slam that is most likely to happen at, as it will with Britain's Jack Draper, who triumphed in the men's final.In truth, it could be any of the four, as Andreeva possesses a skillset suited to any surface.The Russian agrees, saying: \"I like to play on clay, I like to play on hard, I like to play on grass. So I can say that all three of them are my favourites.\"When Sonay Kartal lost in Indian Wells qualifying, she checked out of her rented accommodation and expected to be flying out of California.Plans quickly changed. The British number three was picked out as a lucky loser - a player who takes a place in the main draw despite being beaten in qualifying - and went on to enjoy a memorable fortnight.A heavy defeat by Sabalenka ended the run, but Kartal climbs 20 places to a career-high of 63rd in the world rankings as a result.While Kartal is the biggest mover, former world number three Maria Sakkari dropped 22 places.Sakkari, who was defending points from her run to last year's Indian Wells final, has tumbled out of the top 50 for the first time since 2019.On the men's side, Tallon Griekspoor jumped nine places to 31st in the world after causing a shock on his way to a first Masters quarter-final.Few people gave the 28-year-old Dutchman a chance of beating top seed Alexander Zverev - especially given he had never beaten a top-five player in 18 previous attempts.But Griekspoor, a talented player with a powerful baseline game, stunned an out-of-sorts Zverev in a comeback win and carried his momentum to reach the last eight.Draper and Kartal were not the only British players to enjoy success in Indian Wells.In the women's doubles, Olivia Nicholls reached her first WTA 1000 final alongside Slovakian's Tereza Mihalikova.Nicholls, 30, has surged up the doubles rankings since forming a partnership with Mihalikova last May.Despite their loss to Dutch-American pair Demi Schurrs and Asia Muhammad, British number one Nicholls has soared to a career-high 31st in the world.Britain's strong stable of men's doubles players, led by Australian Open champion Henry Patten, all lost in the Indian Wells second round.All-British pairs Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski, Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash, plus Jamie Murray joined Patten in an early exit.From Indian Wells, we go straight to Miami for the second half of the 'Sunshine Double'.This is another combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 event. It is the tier below the four Grand Slams and one of the most prestigious prizes in the sport.Novak Djokovic, as ever, is one of the most intriguing storylines as the 24-time major champion looks to avoid a third straight defeat.Defending men's champion Jannik Sinner is missing as he serves a three-month ban for a doping offence, though reigning women's champion Danielle Collins - who planned to retire last year before doing a U-turn - will return.From a British perspective, Draper, Emma Raducanu, Katie Boulter, Cameron Norrie and Draper are named in the main draw.Starting on Tuesday, the Miami Open culminates on 29-30 March and is the final hard-court event before the season moves to the European clay-court swing.What is Second Serve?With so many professional tennis tournaments taking place across the world, and across so many levels, it can be hard to keep across everything from one week to the next.As part of BBC Sport's commitment to offer more for tennis fans, Second Serve will be your weekly round-up of the biggest talking points in the sport.As well as the main talking point, you can see which ATP and WTA players are making significant progress - or struggling for form, how the British contingent are doing and what the next stops on the calendars are.You can also sign up to get the latest tennis news from BBC Sport delivered straight to your mobile phone.More on this story",
