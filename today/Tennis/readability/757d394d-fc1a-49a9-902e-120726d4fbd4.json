  "description": "World No.4 Coco Gauff will make her United Cup debut for Team USA alongside world No.7 and US Open finalist Taylor Fritz at the innovative mixed team event in 2025. Twenty-year-old Gauff, who was the flag bearer for the United States at the Olympic Games in Paris, thrives in a team environment. “This will be my first time playing the United Cup so I’m super excited to kick off the year in Australia,” Gauff said. “It’s always an honour to represent my country.” “It’s a really, cool event. I had a lot of fun playing mixed doubles at the Olympics so I kinda want to do that again. “I’ve never been to other parts of Australia, other than Melbourne. I don’t know what city we’re going to play in yet but I’m super excited to go whether it’s Perth or Sydney.” [ATP APP] World No.3 Alexander Zverev, who helped guide Team Germany to a memorable comeback win over Poland to secure the second edition of the United Cup, used the event to set up a stellar season, including deep runs at the Grand Slams and the Roland Garros final. The 27-year-old, who holds 22 ATP singles titles, is looking forward to making his third appearance at the tournament. “It’s the first week of the year… and we all want to be in Australia and play against the best players in the world and that’s what the United Cup brings,” Zverev said. “Playing for your nation is obviously extremely special and I have the best memories from this year.” The unique team environment United Cup offers is also a big motivation for Leylah Fernandez and Felix Auger-Aliassime who are set to line up for Team Canada again in 2025. “I want to play United Cup 2025 because it’s such a fun team experience,” said Fernandez, a US Open finalist in 2021. “I love being part of a team... I get to see a little bit more of the men’s side of the team and also how they think on court, I get to pick their brains a little bit. “I also think the interaction between all of us [is special], we grew up together so it’s good to have that moment to catch up.” We're baaaaack!

I love her energy, I love her game so it’s going to be a lot of fun. “It’s honestly my favourite thing, some of my favourite weeks on tour [playing as part of a team].” Greece’s (12) Stefanos Tsitsipas and Maria Sakkari, China’s (7) Zheng Qinwen and Norway’s (9) Casper Ruud committed to the third edition of the tournament in September. From Friday 27 December to Sunday 5 January, 18 countries, featuring up to three men and up to three women, will compete across Perth and Sydney. United Cup Tournament Director Stephen Farrow is delighted to have five more players commit to the tournament early. “We are so pleased to see Grand Slam champion Coco Gauff line up for Team USA for the first time alongside US Open finalist Taylor Fritz,” Farrow said. “Germany’s world No.3 Alexander Zverev, the two-time Grand Slam finalist and Tokyo Olympics gold medallist, always brings the energy to the United Cup and no doubt the defending champions will be raring to go for the first week of the new year. “We are also excited to welcome Leylah Fernandez and Felix Auger-Aliassime back to the event in 2025. The Canadian fans turned out in droves earlier this year and we look forward to seeing them in their country colours again to support the team’s next campaign.” Participation for the first 16 teams in the United Cup is subject to players committing by the tournament’s entry deadline of 16 October. The remaining two teams will be decided after the second qualification date of 19 November.
