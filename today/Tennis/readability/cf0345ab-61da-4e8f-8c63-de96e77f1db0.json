  "text": "Iga Swiatek avoided another shock defeat against Filipina teenager Alexandra Eala by fighting back to win their Madrid Open second-round match.World number two Swiatek, who was stunned by Eala in Miami last month, won 4-6 6-4 6-2 on the Spanish clay.A sticky start appeared to justify some pre-match talk that Swiatek might have issues dealing with her teenage opponent.\"I understand that there's hype about these young players, but you have got to be focused on yourself,\" Swiatek said afterwards.\"Honestly, I didn't realise it, I had better things to think about.\"Swiatek lost in the Stuttgart quarter-finals last week and, having received a bye in the Madrid first round, produced some edgy groundstrokes in a poor first set.A tally of 25 unforced errors indicated it was a performance nowhere near befitting of the WTA Tour's dominant clay-court player of recent seasons.Mistakes continued to come as the 23-year-old from Poland fell a break down early in the second set.Swiatek, who is the reigning Madrid champion and has a host of ranking points to defend over the European clay swing, looked in serious trouble.It felt like the same story as when 19-year-old Eala, then ranked outside the world's top 100, beat her on the Miami hard courts.But five-time major champion Swiatek refocused and realigned to break back, then took control as her improved power and precision from the baseline overwhelmed Eala.Winning five games in a row from 4-4 in the second set swung the match in her favour and, after missing her opportunity to serve out, broke Eala's serve for a hard-fought victory.A telling statistic was Swiatek hitting 57 unforced errors as Eala won only 80 points in the match.Afterwards Swiatek said the high altitude of Madrid, which means the conditions are zippier, also contributed to her wayward returning.\"The balls were flying a little bit out of control from my racquet,\" she said.\"I got the [string] tension a little bit higher in the second set and then it was better.\"When you're not starting well it sometimes takes a little bit more time to find your game, but then I did so I'm glad.\"Swiatek, who is gearing up for a tilt at a fifth French Open title next month, will play Czech 31st seed Linda Noskova in the last 16. The Pole was joined in the third round by Coco Gauff, who overcame a disastrous first set to beat Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska 0-6 6-2 7-5.The world number four will face the unseeded Ann Li in an all-American affair in the third round.Australian Open champion Madison Keys defeated Lucia Bronzetti 6-4 6-3 to reach the last 32, where she will play Anna Kalinskaya.Stuttgart champion Jelena Ostapenko suffered a shock 7-6 (7-2) 6-2 loss to fellow Latvian Anastasija Sevastova, who is making her second comeback in three years following maternity leave and a serious knee injury.",
