  "description": "Novak Djokovic set one record on Sunday at the 2025 Miami Open presented by Itau. Could there be more to come? The Serbian defeated Camilo Ugo Carabelli 6-1, 7-6(1) to book his fourth-round spot at Hard Rock Stadium. It was Djokovic‚Äôs 411th match win at Masters 1000 events, moving him clear of his great rival Rafael Nadal for the most in series history (since 1990). He also remained on course for a record seventh title at the hard-court event in Florida with his triumph against lucky loser Carabelli. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm honoured to have another milestone, another record broken,‚Äù said Djokovic. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always something on the line, pretty much every time I play, and of course that motivates me to do well at tournaments.‚Äù Djokovic raced to the first set in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Carabelli and appeared to have taken complete control when he broke his opponent‚Äôs serve in the third game of the second. Yet the Argentine dug deep to immediately reclaim the break and held firm behind serve from then on to force a tie-break. There was little Ugo Carabelli could do to cling on in the tie-break, however, as the 99-time tour-level titlist Djokovic raised his level to complete his one-hour, 45-minute win. The Serbian finished the match having won 80 per cent (39/49) of points behind his first serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

The Italian earlier overcame Felix Auger-Aliassime 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 to reach the fourth round for the second consecutive year. The World No. 16 Musetti earned back-to-back wins for only the second time this season by seeing off Auger-Aliassime after two hours and 26 minutes. He converted four of 14 break points he earned against the Canadian en route to his first Top 20 win since last October. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
