  "description": "Carlos Alcaraz admits to have had no response to the blistering tennis thrown at him Thursday by Tomas Machac, who upset the World No. 2 in the quarter-finals of the Rolex Shanghai Masters. Alcaraz's 12-match winning streak came to an abrupt end in a 7-6(5), 7-5 defeat at the hands of Machac, who claimed his second win over a Top-5 player (Djokovic, Geneva SF). It was a winning streak that included the pair's maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash at the Davis Cup last month, in which Machac was forced to retire at one set apiece. As he did when representing Czechia, Machac took the opening set in a tie-break in Shanghai, but the 23-year-old made no mistake of closing it out in straight sets, exuding extreme confidence throughout.

His level was so high. I thought that he was going to give me an opportunity, a window, but he didn't. ‚ÄúFrom the first game until the last one, his level was so high.

But, at some points, I didn't know what to do.‚Äù Alcaraz showed signs of a second-set fightback after he had retrieved the break back, but Machac kept his foot on the gas to dismantle the Spaniard‚Äôs serve for a second time before serving out the victory with ease. ‚ÄúIt was unbelievable, it was crazy for me,‚Äù added Alcaraz. ‚ÄúHe was pushing me to the limit all the time that I was thinking that I had to put the right ball in the right place all the time. If not, I was going to run everywhere, or he was going to make a winner. So I think that the pressure he put [on] me was the key in the match.‚Äù Alcaraz, who has qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin, is next scheduled to play the Rolex Paris Masters after slipping to 51-10 on the season.
