The 23-year-old stunned Carlos Alcaraz 7-6(5), 7-5, and snapped the Spaniard's 12-match winning streak Thursday evening at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. Playing his third tour-level quarter-final, he admitted it was not easy against ‚Äúone of the best‚Äù players on Tour. The Czech is happy with the performance it took to claim the biggest win of his career against the No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings. ‚ÄúWell, I was playing this kind of tennis even with Tommy Paul, [in the] second set and the third set, so I was playing unbelievable even there. So, I was just trying to continue in this way, and it happened from the beginning of the match, so that was the key,\" he shared. \"I know that against Alcaraz I have to play this level to have a chance to win, so I just tried to slow the ball [a little bit]‚Ä¶ I managed to make it until the end, so I'm really happy with that.\" Even though he failed to win against Alcaraz at the Davis Cup last month after being forced to retire during the match, Machac shook the disappointment and delivered a strong performance today. Nerves did not prove a roadblock for him. ‚ÄúI was looking for the revenge, for sure,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI tried to learn from the match against him at the Davis Cup, I was playing [at a] great level also there, but I just tried to do something different, and it happened, and I'm really happy with that.
