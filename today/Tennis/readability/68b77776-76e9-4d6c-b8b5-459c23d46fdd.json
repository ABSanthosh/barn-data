(0:36)Tom Hamilton, Senior WriterNov 19, 2024, 06:19 PM ETClose• Joined ESPN in 2011 • Covered two Olympics, a pair of Rugby World Cups and two British \u0026 Irish Lions tours • Previously rugby editor, and became senior writer in 2018MÁLAGA, Spain -- Rafael Nadal's incredible tennis career came to an end after Spain lost its Davis Cup quarterfinal against the Netherlands on Tuesday.Nadal, 38, announced last month that this would be his final tournament, closing out a remarkable career that saw him win 22 men's Grand Slam titles. Nadal said Monday at a packed media conference that he could no longer reach the competitive level he felt was required to continue to challenge for some of the sport's biggest honors.The hope of many was that Nadal would head into retirement having helped guide Spain to a Davis Cup triumph in front of home support in Málaga. But Spain ended up falling to the Netherlands 2-1.\"The titles and numbers are there so people probably know that, but the way I would like to be remembered is being a good person from a small village in Mallorca where I had the luck to have my uncle as a tennis coach,\" Nadal said Tuesday on court in a special presentation honoring his career. \"I had a great family who supported me in every moment. I was a kid who followed their dreams, worked as hard as possible to be where I am today. At the end of the day, a lot of people try their best every single day, but I'm very lucky to have the life I have to live because of tennis.\"There were no guarantees Nadal was going to play for Spain, in singles at least, as he hadn't played competitive tennis since the Olympics. But team captain David Ferrer opted to start him Tuesday, and he opened the tie against Botic van de Zandschulp. After an emotional national anthem that left Nadal with tears in his eyes, he started well against the Dutchman but ultimately fell 6-4, 6-4.That meant Carlos Alcaraz needed to get a result in the next singles match against Tallon Griekspoor to keep Spain in the tie. He closed that one out 7-6, 6-3, meaning it came down to the doubles.Nadal had already fielded questions from the media at that stage and said that if he were Ferrer, he would bench himself if Spain progressed. He was there among the Spanish team living and breathing every point as Alcaraz and Marcel Granollers faced Wesley Koolhof and Van de Zandschulp for a spot in the semifinal. The Dutch pair took the first set 7-6 (4) and closed the match out in the second set, winning it 7-6 (3).Nadal was honored postmatch with an emotional presentation on court, as the 11,300-strong crowd paid tribute to him.Nadal gave a lengthy speech in Spanish, before a video was played in which several sports stars paid tribute. Footballers Raul, Iker Casillas and Rodri hailed Nadal, as did golfer Sergio Garcia.There also were tributes from his fellow tennis pros, with Serena Williams saying she wanted to \"play like you [Nadal].\" Andy Murray said it has been \"incredible to watch\" Nadal play, while Novak Djokovic praised Nadal's \"power and tenacity,\" saying \"it's something that will be studied\" and adding it was an honor to be called his rival. And then there were the plaudits from Roger Federer, who earlier in the day had posted a 585-word tribute to Nadal.Nadal now heads into retirement with his 22 Grand Slams, including his dominance of Roland Garros with his 14 French Open singles titles.Said Nadal: \"I want to be remembered as good person and a kid who followed their dreams and achieved more than I ever believed possible.\"",
