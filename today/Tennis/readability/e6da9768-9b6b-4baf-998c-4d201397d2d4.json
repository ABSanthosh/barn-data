  "description": "Tomas Machac put an end to Carlos Alcaraz‚Äôs 12-match winning streak in emphatic fashion on Thursday to reach the last four at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. Competing in his third tour-level quarter-final, the No. 33 in the PIF ATP Rankings ignited some of his most blistering tennis to neutralise the threat of the World No. 2, prevailing 7-6(5), 7-5. In a match in which both players produced high-quality tennis, Machac found another gear to record his second win over a Top-5 opponent (Djokovic, Geneva SF). ‚ÄúI knew that the level of my tennis would be great because I am playing the best right now, for sure,‚Äù said Machac. ‚ÄúI beat Tommy Paul [in my] last match with an unbelievable performance. With these types of players, I have to play this level otherwise it‚Äôs 6-2, 6-3 [and] you go home, there is no other option. I am happy I managed to play like this for two sets. ‚ÄúI knew that I had a chance [to beat Alcaraz], but you never know, even with a set and 5-4 [lead] it‚Äôs still so far from winning the match. I played great tennis against him in the Davis Cup [in September], but there was this level [for] only one set.

The 23-year-old made no mistake this time, however, striking 20 winners in a statement opening set before dismantling Alcaraz's serve in the third game of the second. Alcaraz showed signs of a fightback after he had retrieved the break, but the Czech maintained his composure to seal victory in one hour and 54 minutes, winning 100 per cent (7/7) of points at the net in the second set, according to Infosys ATP Stats. [ATP APP] Machac, who opted to play an ATP Challenger Tour event instead of the Rolex Shanghai Masters last year, is now up to No. 25 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. He will face World No. 1 Jannik Sinner for a spot in the final after the Italian eased past Daniil Medvedev to reach his first Shanghai semi-final. After becoming the fourth lowest-ranked semi-finalist in Shanghai tournament history, Machac will bid to level his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Sinner after falling to a 6-4, 6-2 defeat in the quarter-finals of the ATP Masters 1000 in Miami. ‚ÄúI am looking forward to it,‚Äù Machac said of his upcoming clash with Sinner. ‚ÄúI am really enjoying it and am happy that I can play against the best [players].\" [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
