  "description": "ATPTour.com highlights five players from the ATP Challenger Tour to watch during the Australian Open. Record-breaker Fearnley The 23-year-old Jacob Fearnley has enjoyed one of the fastest ascents to the Top 100 in recent memory. Last January, the Briton was No. 646 in the PIF ATP Rankings and had competed in just one Challenger-level event (in 2022). Fearnley helped Texas Christian University claim the 2024 NCAA team title in May before making a splash at the pro level. Fearnley lifted the trophy at his first four of five Challenger events last year, helping him eventually hit a career-high No. 86 this month. Fearnley became just the third player to finish a Challenger season with a win percentage of 90 per cent or greater (min. 25 matches played). He also made the biggest jump to the year-end Top 100 since Jannik Sinner in 2019.The four-time ITA All-American, who took a set off Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon, faces home favourite Nick Kyrgios in the first round.

The 18-year-old won the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF without dropping a set. The teenager became the second-youngest titlist in the eventâ€™s history, only behind Sinner, the Australian Open top seed and World No. 1.

Tommy Robredo and Nicolas Almagro, former Top 10 players in the PIF ATP Rankings, also accomplished the feat. Landaluce, who won his maiden Challenger title in Olbia, Italy in October, finished ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, one spot shy from qualifying for the eight-player Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF.
