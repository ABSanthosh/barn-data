  "description": "Jakub Mensik is only 19 years old, but has already proven a force on the ATP Tour. Everything is adding up for the Czech #NextGenATP star, who will face Arthur Fils in the quarter-finals of the Miami Open presented by Itau. ATPTour.com caught up with the teen about his favourite rivalry, the goal he is chasing, his greatest success and more. Who is your greatest rival? What makes them so tough? [I don't have one] yet, because, I played just a couple of guys more than once. I know there are plenty of guys my age, little bit older, but yeah, for now, I, I don't have any rivalry [like] let's say, I don't know, Sinner and Alcaraz. What is your favourite tennis rivalry and why? For now, it's obviously Jannik and Carlos, because they are just three years older. Actually, Jannik is four years. But for the future, I can play with them plenty of matches. So of course, them, because I [am] close to them [in age], my game style is also very close.   What has been the most unique moment in your career? Probably playing the quarter-finals against my idol Novak Djokovic in Shanghai.... Once I was beating the good players, Andrey [Rublev] , Grigor [Dimitrov], and moving there, and I was like, 'Okay, well, if I win this match, I can play against him'. It happened. So, after that, when I had the day off, I was super nervous, but very excited. It is different when you're watching him and when you're playing against him. Everything [went] not like in my expectations. What is the biggest number or accomplishment you have been chasing and how long have you been pursuing it? If we are talking about this season, I would like to reach the Top 30. I think it's just a good goal — a good set goal — because last year it was Top 200, Top 80. I reached Top 50. But then it's very tough to go higher and higher. So I think if I will be in the Top 30, Top 25 at the end of this year, it's pretty good. I like the way of my game and my improvement. What has been your greatest success? Biggest success so far, I don't know, being on ATP Tour for one year, to be stable there, and to play against the best players in the world, and to beat them. Of course, I have plenty of good results in the tournaments — Shanghai, Grand Slams. So obviously, my level of improving is there, and that's the success and I'm still always improving. What is the greatest difficulty you have had to overcome? Struggling with the injury last year with my elbow. What is your favourite tournament to play and why? Indian Wells. It’s super nice. There you receive a car, you can play golf there. Of course [I play golf], I do actually, since two years ago. And I’m playing only [at] the tournaments. What has been the coolest off-court experience you have been able to enjoy because you are a professional tennis player? During the Next Gen in Jeddah, we had a party on the boat from the ATP... In Jeddah, we were having fun together, which was kind of out of topic and something different. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
