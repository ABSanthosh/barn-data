  "description": "#NextGenATP Norwegian Nicolai Budkov Kjaer captured his first ATP Tour win on Tuesday at the Nordea Open in Bastad, where he earned a 5-7, 6-3, 7-6(2) comeback victory against Brazilian Thiago Monteiro. The 18-year-old, who came through qualifying at the ATP 250 clay-court event, has climbed four spots to ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah and will next play fourth seed Sebastian Baez in Sweden. Budkov Kjaer is looking to qualify for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF for the first time and has tasted success in the past year. Twelve months ago, the Norwegian lifted the Wimbledon boys’ singles trophy and then cracked the winner's code on the ATP Challenger Tour for the first time in February when he triumphed in Glasgow, Scotland. The 18-year-old was competing in just his fifth event at that level and became the second-youngest Norwegian to win an ATP Challenger Tour title. The only player to do so at a younger age is Casper Ruud, who sent a message of support to his countryman and Davis Cup teammate following his triumph. In other action on Day 2 in Bastad, Swedish wild card Elias Ymer defeated American Tristan Boyer 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 to earn his first ATP Tour win since Stockholm in 2023. Seventh seed Damir Dzumhur moved past Sebastian Ofner 6-4, 6-4 to set a Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting against Hugo Gaston. The Frenchman Gaston downed Chun-Hsin Tseng 6-4, 6-3, breaking the 23-year-old’s serve four times, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Italian qualifier Andrea Pellegrino also advanced, overcoming Portugal’s Jaime Faria 2-6, 6-3, 6-3. He will next play second seed Tallon Griekspoor. Botic van de Zandschulp led Mikael Ymer 5-4 in the first set when played was suspended for the day due to rain. Cristian Garin and Camilo Ugo Carabelli will also resume on Wednesday with the Chilean ahead 3-2 in the first set. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
