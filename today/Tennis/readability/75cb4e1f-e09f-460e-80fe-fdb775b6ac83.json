The 39-year-old dug deep to prevail 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and record back-to-back tour-level wins for the first time since reaching the third round of the 2023 US Open. Wawrinka twice trailed by a break in the deciding set, but found some gutsy tennis to advance in two hours, 12 minutes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm super happy to get through this match, it was a tough opponent today, but the level was good and it was great to win two matches here,‚Äù said Wawrinka. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an amazing atmosphere, a full house.

Davidovich Fokina then raised his level in a near-flawless second set, during which he won 89 per cent (16/18) of points behind his first serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats. However, the 25-year-old was unable to close out the match in a deciding set full of momentum shifts. Wawrinka eventually took advantage of an untimely double fault from his opponent to set up the sole match point needed. [ATP APP] Wawrinka will face top seed Andrey Rublev, who got underway with an emphatic 6-4, 6-1 win over Alexandre Muller. Rublev did not blink throughout the contest, during which he struck 17 winners and saved all three of the break points he faced. Rublev is currently eighth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, leading ninth-placed Alex de Minaur by just 275 points in what is turning out to be an absorbing battle for qualification for the Nitto ATP Finals. Earlier, Miomir Kecmanovic held his nerve in a thrilling contest with Nicolas Jarry that went down to the wire. The Serbian clinched the hard-fought contest 6-4, 4-6, 7-6(2). Third seed Grigor Dimitrov closed the day with a 7-6(1), 6-3 victory against Quentin Halys to record his 18th match win ‚Äî most among active players ‚Äî at the ATP 250. The Bulgarian, who won his first tour-level title in Stockholm in 2013, will meet Swiss Dominic Stricker in the quarter-finals. Dimitrov, currently tenth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, is aiming to make a late-season push and qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the first time since he won the season finale in 2017.
