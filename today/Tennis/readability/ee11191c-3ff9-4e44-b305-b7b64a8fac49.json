  "description": "Novak Djokovic and Coco Gauff don't usually stand across from each other at the net, but they did at the Miami Open presented by Itau. The ATP and WTA stars took a break from regular tennis to battle it out in a fun game of Giant Tennis Pong, where they used their racquets to launch balls into towering cups at Hard Rock Stadium. With Djokovic’s surgical precision and Gauff’s standout shot-making, the game turned into a wild mix of trick shots, fails and plenty of playful trash talk. But who walks away with the ultimate bragging rights? Check out the video below, courtesy of the Miami Open presented by Itau, to see who wins.
