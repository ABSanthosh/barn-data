  "text": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, World number one Sinner is expected to return to action at the Italian Open in MayWorld number one Jannik Sinner considered walking away from tennis during his doping case, stating he \"didn't feel comfortable\" as players looked at him \"differently\" during the Australian Open.The 23-year-old Italian returned two positive tests for banned substance clostebol in March 2024 and accepted a three-month ban from the World Anti-Doping Agency in February, just weeks after successfully defending his crown in Melbourne.\"I remember before the Australian Open this year, I was not in a very happy moment because there was still that case of doping,\" Sinner told Italian broadcaster RAI.\"I didn't really feel comfortable in the locker room, where I ate. It was a bit like some players looked at me differently and I didn't like it at all.\"I felt like being in tennis, with that atmosphere, was too much. I was always someone who joked about, who went in the dressing room speaking with whoever, but it became different. I wasn't at ease.\"I didn't feel comfortable and then I said, maybe after Australia, a little bit of free time, in the sense where I take a little break, it will do me good.\"Sinner had previously been cleared of any wrongdoing by an independent panel, but Wada launched an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), seeking a ban of up to two years.However, he reached a settlement with the anti-doping agency for a shorter sanction and is expected to make his comeback at the Italian Open (6-18 May) in Rome after his ban expires on 5 May.Wada acknowledged Sinner did not gain any competitive advantage from the banned substance, and that he bore no fault for an accidental contamination.His ban was criticised by some in the tennis world, with 23-time Grand Slam singles champion Serena Williams stating she would have received a 20-year ban and had her titles \"taken away\".Former British number one Tim Henman labelled the agreement \"too convenient\", while three-time Swiss Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka said he \"did not believe in clean sport anymore\".However, Sinner defended his position as he added: \"I don't want to respond to criticism. People are free to say what they want and judge people. \"What matters to me is that I known what I've been through. It was difficult and I wouldn't wish anyone to go through that as an innocent person.\"More on this story",
