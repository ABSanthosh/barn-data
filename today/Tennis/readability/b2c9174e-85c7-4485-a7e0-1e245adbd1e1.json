  "text": "French Open 2025Dates: 25 May-8 June Venue: Roland GarrosCoverage: Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and appBritain's Jacob Fearnley was a month short of his fourth birthday when Stan Wawrinka made his French Open debut in 2005.Fast forward 20 years and Fearnley will now make his Roland Garros bow against the 40-year-old former champion.Despite the gulf in experience on clay, world number 55 Fearnley has the ability and youthful vigour to beat 2015 winner Wawrinka.The Swiss veteran, who has dropped to 138th in the rankings, was given a wildcard to play in the second major of the season and has only won two matches in Paris since 2020.\"I think you have to give your opponents a certain amount of respect, especially when they've won a lot on such big stages and been successful for so long,\" Fearnley said.\"But I think the challenge is maybe not giving them too much respect so that then you go into the match thinking you're going to lose.\"Obviously Wawrinka has done incredible things, but I have to remember that I'm here to win and here to play a match. \"I will always go in with respect, but with confidence that I can win.\"Fearnley meets Wawrinka on court 14 at about 14:00 BST, with three other Britons also playing on the second day of action.Emma Raducanu makes her first French Open appearance since 2022 when she plays China's Wang Xinyu at 10:00 BST, with Jodie Burrage facing American former world number seven Danielle Collins straight after.British women's number one Katie Boulter aims for a maiden Roland Garros win against French qualifier Carole Monnet at about 15:00 BST.Eye-catching draws against big names are becoming the norm for Fearnley.The 23-year-old Scot rose to the occasion when he played Novak Djokovic on Wimbledon's Centre Court last year on his Grand Slam debut, while a febrile atmosphere did not stop him beating Nick Kyrgios in the Australian Open first round in January.More recently, he played Italian veteran Fabio Fognini - like Kyrgios, a firebrand who whips up a partisan crowd - on his farewell appearance in Rome.\"I joke about it with my team - I was sure I was going to play [French veteran] Richard Gasquet because it is his final French Open,\" Fearnley told BBC Sport.\"Wawrinka is pretty close in terms of coming towards the end of their careers but still playing amazing tennis.\"It's cool - and a good problem to have.\"Fearnley had not even played an ATP clay-court match until last month.This time last year, he was unranked in the professional game and still playing in the \"brutal\" United States college tennis system where he developed his aggressive game.After finishing his kinesiology degree at Texas Christian University, he moved into the professional ranks and has since had one of the sharpest rises in ATP Tour history.Fearnley has climbed to the verge of the top 50, overtaking former world number eight Cameron Norrie as the British men's number two in the process.\"A year ago we had just won our first national championships at TCU,\" said Fearnley.\"So to see the progression and a year later be playing the main draw at the French Open is pretty incredible. \"I'm very happy with the progress and still can't quite believe it.\"Coming face-to-face with the superstars in the locker room still remains a 'pinch-me' moment.\"I still do get starstruck. Like in Rome [Jannik] Sinner came and gave me a handshake,\" Fearnley added.\"When Djokovic says 'hi' to me, it's still a little bit strange. I always smile at my coach whenever that happens because it is cool moments.\"",
