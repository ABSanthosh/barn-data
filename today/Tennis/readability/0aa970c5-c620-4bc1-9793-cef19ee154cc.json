  "description": "The ATP has announced a record $28.5 million in ATP Challenger Tour prize money for the 2025 season – up $6.2 million year on year and 135 per cent since 2022. The increases are the result of major Challenger Tour reforms delivered under OneVision – ATP’s long-term strategic plan – to expand the number of players able to make a sustainable living from tennis. A central driver of prize money increases has been the formation of Tennis Data Innovations (TDI) and the successful commercialisation of Challenger Tour rights. Calendar enhancements have helped drive growth, through the introduction of premium Challenger 175 events and a rise in the number of higher category Challenger 100 and 125 events. Under OneVision, ATP has established a dedicated Challenger Tour team with new leadership to oversee growth and new revenue opportunities. Significant investment in marketing, headlined by the launch of the Challenger Tour’s ‘On The Rise’ brand campaign, has played an important role in enhancing the visibility and commercial appeal of the Tour. ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi said: “Creating a sustainable player pathway to the ATP Tour is vital for the future of our sport. Since 2022, we’ve invested in significant reforms on the Challenger Tour. The results have been clear: record-breaking prize money, year on year increases and most importantly, more players inside the Top 250 provided with greater financial compensation at this level.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
