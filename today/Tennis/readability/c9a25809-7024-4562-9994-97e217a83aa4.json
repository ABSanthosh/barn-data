  "text": "'Best I've played in a while' - Djokovic moves on in ShanghaiImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Novak Djokovic is aiming for a record-extending fifth Shanghai title, following wins in 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2018Novak Djokovic moved a step closer to a landmark 100th ATP title with another dominant performance at the Shanghai Masters.The Serb, 37, reached the quarter-finals with a 6-3 6-1 victory over Russia's Roman Safiullin.Djokovic, who won his 99th title with Olympic gold in August, will face Czech teenager Jakub Mensik in the last eight.The 24-time major champion is aiming to become only the third man - after Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) - to clock up a century of tournament victories.Asked how he rated his performance against Safiullin out of 10, he said: \"Very close to 10. The [past two matches] are some of the best I've played in a while.\"Making his first return to Shanghai since 2019, Djokovic acknowledged the prospect of winning a landmark title is giving him \"extra motivation\" in the ATP 1000 event.Djokovic, a record four-time champion, has won more matches at the event than any other player.With a host of other top-10 players remaining in the draw, including Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz and Daniil Medvedev, tougher tests undoubtedly lie ahead.But, in his first ATP tournament since a shock third-round exit at the US Open five weeks ago, fourth seed Djokovic has looked sharp.Causing problems for opponents by serving precisely and overwhelming them in the baseline exchanges, he has not dropped a set against American youngster Alex Michelsen, Italian world number 30 Flavio Cobolli and now Safiullin.\"I'm enjoying myself on the court and when you play well you are feeling good, there is a lot of joy in striking a tennis ball,\" added Djokovic.\"These matches and sensations are the reasons why I still play. \"I believe I can play at a high level and it's about keeping that consistency.\"Who else has made the Shanghai quarter-finals?Second seed Alexander Zverev was a prospective semi-final opponent for Djokovic, but the German suffered a surprise 6-4 7-5 defeat by Belgian veteran David Goffin.Goffin, 33, dropped out of the top 100 in June but, having worked hard to regain his form, has moved into his first quarter-final above ATP 250 level since Wimbledon in 2022.Earlier on Wednesday, world number one Sinner beat American 14th seed Ben Shelton 6-4 7-6 (7-1) to set up a quarter-final against Medvedev.The Russian fifth seed progressed with a straight-sets win, beating Greek 10th seed Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-6 (7-3) 6-3.Tsitsipas had an argument with umpire Fergus Murphy after being given a time violation when serving with a 2-1 lead in the second set.He accused the official of being \"against\" him, going on to lose serve before winning just one of the next five games.Spain's Alcaraz, who won the Beijing title last week, extended his winning streak to 12 matches with a 6-4 7-5 win against French veteran Gael Monfils.More on this story",
