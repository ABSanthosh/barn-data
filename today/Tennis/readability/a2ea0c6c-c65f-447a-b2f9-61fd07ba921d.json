  "description": "Carlos Alcaraz kept his winning streak alive on Wednesday as he earned a 12th consecutive victory to advance to the quarter-finals at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. Alcaraz was forced to battle hard in a 6-4, 7-5 win over Gael Monfils, becoming the first Spaniard to reach the last eight at the Chinese ATP Masters 1000 since 2017 (Nadal, Ramos-Vinolas). In a display of bruising ball-striking paired with crafty touch from both players, Alcaraz held his nerve to improve to 3-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.
