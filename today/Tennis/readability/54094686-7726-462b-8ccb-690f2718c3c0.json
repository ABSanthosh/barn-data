  "description": "Carlos Alcaraz is hitting peak form ahead of his title defence at Roland Garros. After claiming his fourth consecutive win over rival Jannik Sinner and triumphing at the Internazionali BNL d’Italia in Rome for the first time Sunday, Alcaraz was in high spirits. The 22-year-old Spaniard praised his tactical clarity, which helped him capture a seventh ATP Masters 1000 title and a 19th tour-level trophy, tying Sinner for the most among players born in the 2000s. “Winning tournaments, lifting trophies gives you a lot of confidence coming to the next tournaments,” Alcaraz said after his 7-6(5), 6-1 win over Sinner. “Masters 1000s give you a lot of confidence [in] yourself just to know that you are on the right path, in the right way, playing great tennis. “I'm just excited about what's come for me. But that means that I'm doing the right things and I'm going to keep doing the right things, the right work, just coming to Paris.” Alcaraz was forced to save two set points in the opening set, before displaying impressive resolve to pull clear against the home favourite in Sunday’s final. After improving to 7-4 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Sinner, Alcaraz spoke of the importance of the marquee matchup, which is set to remain a headline-maker for years to come. Despite being out of action for three months, Sinner, the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, delivered a memorable showing in front of a vibrant home crowd in the Italian capital. Yet Alcaraz raised his level to snap Sinner’s 26-match winning streak, later acknowledging the “aura” of his opponent, and how he has been able to combat him. “I think today was a great level for both of us, especially the first set,” said Alcaraz. “It was really, really tight, serving two set points. I knew at the beginning, the matches against Jannik are always really tactical matches. I think today I started the match really well. Tactically [from] the beginning until the last ball, I didn't lose focus, which is great for me. [It was] probably one of the best matches I played so far in terms of level, so I'm just really proud about that. “He's the best player in the world. It doesn't matter that he was out of the Tour for three months. Every tournament he's playing, he plays great. The numbers are there. I mean, he wins almost every match he plays. That's why I'm even more focused when I play against him. If I don't play at my best, 10 out of 10, it's going to be impossible to beat him. That's why I'm more focused when I'm playing against him, or I feel a little bit different when I'm going to face him than other players. “He has that aura. When you're seeing him on the other side of the net, it's different. That's why obviously I'm feeling that the people are putting so much, let's say - how can I say - pressure in a certain way to both of us when we are facing each other.” With his one-hour, 45-minute victory over Sinner, Alcaraz improved to 30-5 on the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Either side of being forced to withdraw from the Masters 1000 in Madrid due to an adductor injury, the 22-year-old claimed titles in Monte-Carlo and Rome. Alcaraz will now turn attention to his title defence at Roland Garros and the start of the grass season, where he is also reigning champion at Wimbledon. While he has a lot of rankings points to defend, Alcaraz leads the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, that is an indicator for the ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours. After claiming his maiden title at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters last month, Alcaraz alluded to the difficulty of living up to the expectation put on him during the clay season, which he entered on the back of an opening-round defeat to David Goffin in Miami. But after his victory over Sinner, the 22-year-old claimed to be in a good place and “on the right path”. “The feeling that I'm having right now, it is a totally different feeling [to what] I was feeling before, in Miami or before [that] tournament,” said Alcaraz. “I'm approaching every match in a different way, which I'm really proud about. I found the right path, the right way again. During the matches in some moments I just felt totally different. “Before I was totally nervous, I couldn't handle the nerves as [well] as I'm doing right now. I was focused on other things that were important, about the results, about [thinking] I have to win, I have to make results. Right now I'm focusing in a totally different way, in different things, which is just being happy, being proud about the moments that I’m living. I think that’s the right path. “I'm just feeling great, feeling great right now.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
