  "description": "Novak Djokovic finished with a flourish against Roman Safiullin on Wednesday to reach the quarter-finals of the Rolex Shanghai Masters for a 10th time. The record four-time champion was forced to dig deep in a 6-3, 6-2 win, remaining firmly alive in his quest for a 100th tour-level title. If Djokovic lifts the trophy in Shanghai, he would become the third man to achieve this feat in the Open Era (Connors, Federer). ‚ÄúBoth last night's match and tonight have been, maybe, some of the best matches I have played in a while, so I am just enjoying myself on the court,‚Äù said Djokovic, who improved to 35-8 on the season. ‚ÄúWhen you play well and feel good, there is obviously a lot of joy in striking a tennis ball on the court. ‚ÄúThese sensations I have on the tennis court are some of the reasons why I keep on playing and keep on competing because I really believe that I can play at a very high level. Now, it‚Äôs a matter of keeping that consistency and also having a good time off the court.‚Äù Novak ü´∂ Shanghai@DjokerNole defeats Safiullin 6-3 6-2 to reach his 10th #RolexShanghaiMasters quarter-final.@SH_RolexMasters pic.twitter.com/jwkzo8QE9A ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) October 9, 2024 Djokovic, who improved to 3-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, showed resilience to save 100 per cent (3/3) of the break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. After extending his lead in tournament wins (37), Djokovic will face #NextGenATP star Jakub Mensik, who held his nerve to defeat Grigor Dimitrov 6-3, 3-6, 6-4. The 19-year-old Czech, who clinched his fourth consecutive win against a Top 10 player, is the youngest quarter-finalist in Shanghai tournament history. Safiullin withstood an electric start from Djokovic, landing an inside-out forehand winner crisp on the line to save break point in the second game. However, he was unable to replicate this form to convert the two break chances he had in the fifth game, with the Serb serving his way out of trouble with ease. [ATP APP] Djokovic, who has won a record 40 ATP Masters 1000 titles, remained in control to capitalise on an error-strewn eighth game from Safiullin and storm into the lead. The second set was more straightforward for Djokovic as he proved clinical to break twice and cruise across the finish line. Since his gruelling opener with #NextGenATP Alex Michelsen, which ended 7-6(3), 7-6(9), Djokovic has spent just two hours and 16 minutes on court. This is in stark contrast to Mensik, who has played four consecutive three-set matches to reach this stage. Djokovic is currently eighth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. A strong run in Shanghai will bolster his chances of securing a spot at the Nitto ATP Finals in a bid to extend his record of seven titles. Following Djokovic and Safiullin's clash on centre court, David Goffin delivered a vintage performance to upset second seed Alexander Zverev. The Belgian former No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings held on to claim a 6-4, 7-5 win against the German in one hour and 57 minutes. It is the first time Goffin has reached this stage of an ATP Masters 1000 since the 2021 Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters. The 33-year-old will face seventh seed Taylor Fritz for a spot in the final four in Shanghai. Fritz cruised past Holger Rune 6-1, 6-2 in just 55 minutes to secure his spot in the last eight, edging 2-1 in front in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The American, who occupies fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, is now 785 points ahead of ninth-placed Alex de Minaur and in strong contention to secure his spot at the Nitto ATP Finals.
