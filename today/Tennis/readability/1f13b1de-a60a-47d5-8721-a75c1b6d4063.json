  "text": "Jacob Fearnley has received a first call-up to Great Britain's Davis Cup squad for their upcoming tie with Japan.Scot Fearnley, 23, was ranked outside the top 600 a year ago, but he won his first four ATP Challenger titles in 2024 to rise up to 86th in the world rankings.Cameron Norrie, Billy Harris and former Wimbledon doubles champion Neal Skupski have also been selected by Great Britain captain Leon Smith. British number one Jack Draper has opted to miss the first-round qualifier to support his recovery from a hip injury.There is no place for Dan Evans, who said he was thinking \"long and hard\" about ending his Davis Cup career after Britain lost to Canada in September's Finals.Evans, 34, has played 28 Davis Cup ties and was a substitute when they won their last title in 2015, but he has slipped to 160th in the world and fell in the first round of qualifying for the Australian Open.The best-of-five tie against Japan takes place on 31 January and 1 February at the Bourbon Beans Dome in Miki.The winner will face Germany or Israel in September for a place in the Finals.",
