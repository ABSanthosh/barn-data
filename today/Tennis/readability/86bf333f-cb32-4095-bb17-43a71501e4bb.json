  "text": "Boulter fights back to help GB beat Germany in BJK CupMedia caption, Boulter stages brilliant comeback to secure BJK winBritish number one Katie Boulter produced a fine comeback to lead the side to a 2-1 victory over Germany in their Billie Jean King Cup qualifying tie.Boulter grew in confidence on the clay court to beat the crafty Tatjana Maria 1-6 6-3 6-1 and give GB an unassailable lead in the best-of-three tie.Sonay Kartal had earlier impressed on debut, weathering the big-hitting of an emotional Jule Niemeier to win 6-4 6-2 in the Netherlands.Germany claimed a consolation victory in the doubles, with Laura Siegemund and Anna-Lena Friedsam beating Olivia Nicholls and Harriet Dart 6-4 6-1.GB face the Netherlands on Saturday, with the group winner advancing to September's eight-team finals.Germany are out of contention, having lost 3-0 to the hosts on Thursday.Boulter may not count clay as her favourite surface, with her big-hitting game better suited to hard courts and grass, but she showed real intelligence to work her way to victory.The 37-year-old Maria is a tricky player, full of drop shots and slices that wrongfoot her opponents, and Boulter could not find a way through in the early exchanges.Two double faults in one game saw Boulter go a double break down and the experienced Maria capitalised, serving out the first set and going 30-0 up against serve in the opening game of the second.However, Boulter clawed her way to a hold and began to look more settled. Her groundstrokes began to find the lines and, after the two exchanged breaks, back-to-back punishing returns of serve gave the Briton the crucial advantage.Boulter forced a decider and barely looked back, reeling off 10 of the last 11 games and dictating the play with her impressive forehand.\"I just kept believing in myself,\" said the 28-year-old.\"It was hard to come out against someone who has played so well on clay and Tatjana made it difficult for me at the beginning.\"I am very proud of myself for how I came back.\"Kartal 'super proud' of debutMedia caption, 'She's really in full flow now!' Britain's Kartal wins point with brilliant drop shotKartal watched GB's triumph against France in last year's qualifiers from afar, having spent three months out with a health issue.However, she has risen up the rankings in the past 12 months, clinching her first WTA title on the way.A good mover on the clay surface, she played confidently in a first set that saw seven breaks of serve in 10 games, adjusting well to Niemeier's pace.Kartal served for the opener at 5-3 but was broken, before two double faults from Niemeier handed the Briton the set.Germany's Niemeier, heavily beaten against the Netherlands and struggling for form, covered her face with her towel at the end of the set as she became visibly upset.Kartal reeled off five games in a row to lead by a set and a break, redirecting the German's pace around the court, before serving out victory.\"I'm super proud of that debut match,\" said Kartal.\"It is obviously nerve-wracking when you're the first match on, but I'm proud of my performance.\"More on this story",
