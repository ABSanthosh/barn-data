It was Raducanu who defeated Fernandez for the championship at Flushing Meadows four years ago.Both finalists are unseeded. Canada's Fernandez, who is 22 years old, is ranked 36th; Russia's Kalinskaya, 26, is ranked 48th.Kalinskaya moved into her third tour-level final. She went 0-2 in title matches last season.Fernandez, who got past top-seeded Jessica Pegula earlier in the week, owns three titles. Sunday's matchup will be her seventh career final.",
