  "text": "Great Britain's Jodie Burrage suffered defeat to Ajla Tomljanovic as she was knocked out of the ATX Open in Austin, Texas at the last-16 stage.The British player, who had beaten Petra Kvitova in the previous round, started strongly before losing 4-6 6-3 6-0 to the Australian.Burrage, ranked 189, broke Tomljanovic, who is 111 in the world, in the seventh game and that proved to be enough for her to take the opening set.The 25-year-old's serve in the win against Kvitova was key as she sent down 14 aces and she produced six aces in the first set against Tomljanovic.However, Burrage was broken in the fourth game of the second set when she served a double fault to go 3-1 down.She applied plenty of pressure in trying to retrieve the break but Tomljanovic, 31, held her nerve to serve out for the second set.The decider was a one-sided affair as Burrage cut a frustrated figure as she failed to win a game.",
