  "description": "Gael Monfils has long been a fans' favourite on the ATP Tour, thrilling crowds with his inimitable charisma, athletic play and battling spirit. The Frenchman hopes to conjure more more magic at Roland Garros, where he is competing in the main draw for the 18th time. ATPTour.com recently caught up with Monfils to discuss how it has all added up in his career for the former No. 6 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, from his rivals to his struggles and successes. Who is your greatest rival? I don’t have a greatest rival, just some players who I have never beaten. A rival means that you’ve beaten him, but I never beat Novak. I wouldn’t say he’s my greatest rival, but he is the person who I never beat. My rivals were all my French friends. I think about Richard Gasquet, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Gilles Simon. Richard, his tennis was amazing. His selection of shots, the backhand, his touch at the net. Just pure talent. What is your favourite tennis rivalry? I think the Big Four rivalries. There is not one, but it was great to see all of those rivalries mixed up between all of those guys. It was great to witness. What is the greatest difficulty or adversity that you've had to overcome? The Covid year was really tough, there were different vibes during that time. It was a different way of competing and everything, it was really tough.    What has been your greatest success? To have made it as a tennis player, that was my biggest success. What are your favourite tournaments to play? Of course Roland Garros and Paris-Bercy. They are in Paris, the two mean a lot to me. They are the two places where I have all my family and this is something amazing for me.   What's been the most unique moment in your career? In 2004 when I lost to Lleyton Hewitt in Paris-Bercy, it was quite a unique moment. It was the first time I fell to the World No. 2, in a night session in Paris, the second of my life. It was unique in that way because I really loved it, even though I lost the match. Everything was super new for me, I didn’t know what to expect. I saw the crowd involved [and I was] playing in front of a lot of people. That was quite unique for me. What has been the biggest number or the biggest accomplishment that you’ve been chasing? To make it. There is an interview of me on YouTube when I was 11. At that moment, you’re very pure. I said ‘My dream would be to be in the Top 10’, and I made it. If I reflect back, I didn’t say anything else but I wanted to be in the Top 10. So, I made it in that way. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
