  "description": "French lucky loser Corentin Moutet handled a mid-match suspension due to lightning and then took advantage of three Daniil Medvedev double faults in his final service game at the Mubadala Citi DC Open on Friday to advance to his first semi-final above ATP 250 level. After two hours and 15 minutes of action in the gruelling Washington heat, play was halted due to lightning in the local area with the 26-year-old leading Medvedev 1-6, 6-4, 5-4. After a delay of an hour, Moutet returned to court to immediately break Medvedevâ€™s serve and seal a dramatic 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 triumph after two hours and 25 minutes. The World No. 14 unraveled under pressure, coughing up three double faults in the resumed game, including one on the very first point, handing Moutet a golden opportunity that he seized. On his third match point, Moutet won one of the points of the match to capture his fourth Top 20 win on a hard court. After blocking back a return, the 26-year-old scrambled to the net to dig up a Medvedev drop shot. The eighth seed on the full stretch found the edge of his racquet to hit an overhead that clipped the top of the net, allowing Moutet to flick the ball back and then find a majestic lob. Medvedev recovered to the baseline to hit a forehand, but Moutet demonstrated great hand skills at the net to hit flick a pickup off his toes before he found a backhand volley on the full stretch. Medvedev pushed the resulting ball wide, with Moutet collapsing to the court after triumphing. In humid temperatures, Medvedev struck 10 winners in a dominate opening set to lead. However, Moutet, using his court craft and agility, rallied to win the second set and then came out firing upon the resumption to take advantage of Medvedev errors in the closing stages. The lefty is up 13 spots to No. 46 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings following his win and is set to rise to a career-high on Monday. Both players struggled in the hot conditions, with Medvedev receiving a medical timeout mid game at 2-4, 15/15 in the second set due to heat stress.
