  "text": "Former British number one Laura Robson has been appointed tournament director of the new women's event at The Queen's Club in London.The WTA 500 event, which begins on 9 June 2025, will be the first tour level women's event in London for over 50 years. Robson has been tournament director at the Nottingham Open for the past two years, having formally retired from playing in 2022.The 30-year-old, who won Olympic silver in the mixed doubles at London 2012, said she was \"delighted to be taking up this role\". She added: \"I'm confident that the women's event will be just as thrilling and I can't wait to get started.\" Multi-Grand Slam-winning doubles player Jamie Murray will once again oversee the men's tournament, which starts a week later. Following Robson's appointment, Amy Hitchinson has been chosen as her successor at Nottingham, which means that over 70% of LTA grass court major events will have female tournament directors.",
