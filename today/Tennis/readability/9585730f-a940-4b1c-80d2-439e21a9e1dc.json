  "text": "Carlos Alcaraz says he is \"proud\" of how he coped with a \"difficult month\" after he fought back to beat Lorenzo Musetti and win the Monte Carlo Masters.The four-time major champion made a slow start but grew in confidence and quality to overcome the Italian 3-6 6-1 6-0 on the clay.It was a competitive match for a set and a half before Musetti, bidding for the biggest prize of his career, began to struggle with a leg injury.The success was a sixth ATP Masters 1000 trophy for Alcaraz - his first since Indian Wells last year - and an 18th title overall.It also gives the 21-year-old a confidence boost before he defends his French Open title in May, having had a mixed hard-court swing.Alcaraz reached the Indian Wells semi-finals in March, losing to Jack Draper, and suffered a surprise second-round loss to David Goffin in Miami a week later.\"It's been a really difficult week with a lot of difficult situations,\" Alcaraz said.\"I'm really proud of my myself how I've dealt with everything. It's been a really difficult month for me on the court and outside.\"Coming here and seeing how the whole hard work has paid off, I'm really happy.\"Alcaraz made a wayward start against Musetti, seeing an early break lead cancelled out before his 23-year-old opponent reeled off four games in a row.Musetti's accuracy won out over his opponent's pacy hitting, with the Italian clinching the set on an outrageous drop-shot winner from behind the baseline.Alcaraz hit 14 unforced errors in the first set, 11 off the forehand alone, but settled quickly into the second.A roar of \"vamos\" greeted a missed Musetti forehand that handed Alcaraz the break lead, with the Spaniard moving around the court with more conviction and asking the crowd for appreciation after hitting a superb backhand winner.He won five games in a row but Musetti had a glimmer of a chance. He created five break-back points as Alcaraz served for the set, but the second seed saved them all, ultimately closing out an eight-minute game to force a deciding third set.That was barely competitive, though, as Musetti was hindered by a right thigh injury, needing treatment after going 3-0 down, and could barely move.Alcaraz promptly whizzed through the set, raising his arms in celebration before consoling Musetti.The victory also means Alcaraz will replace Germany's Alexander Zverev as world number two when the rankings are updated on Monday.Later, British pair Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool were beaten 1-6 7-6 (10-8) 10-8 in the men's doubles final by home favourite Romain Arneodo and France's Manuel Guinard.",
