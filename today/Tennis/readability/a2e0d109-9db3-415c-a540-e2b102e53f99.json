  "description": "Roger Federer visited the Rafa Nadal Academy by Movistar on Thursday, springing a pleasant surprise on those who were lucky enough to cross paths with the Swiss visitor. Making the most of his summer trip to Mallorca, the former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings visited the facility in Manacor, where he reunited with 92-time tour-level titlist Rafael Nadal, one of his great rivals and friends from the ATP Tour. It was a morning that provoked nostalgia of great sporting memories between two tennis greats who transcended their sport. The Swiss had the opportunity to witness first-hand the intense activity at the academy and visit coaching sessions for children. Federer signed autographs and took selfies with children, making memories for the youngsters who are just taking their first steps in the sport. Federer has often been close at hand during the development of the Rafa Nadal Academy by Movistar, which he first saw in person at the official inauguration in 2016. Having witnessed the progress of the centre throughout its first decade of existence, Federer returned in January 2024 to enjoy the growth of a sports complex of international prestige. Federer and Nadal forged one of the most emblematic rivalries in the sport’s history between 2004 and 2019, with a total of 40 Lexus ATP Head2Head encounters on some of the game’s biggest stages. Nadal reigned victorious in 24 of those matches. Editor's Note: This story has been translated from ATPTour.com/es. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
