The sixth-seeded Darderi prevailed 6-2, 2-6, 6-2 against Raphael Collignon to advance and set a second-round meeting with Tristan Boyer or Elias Ymer by the Swedish seaside. In his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Collignon, Darderi steadied himself after a second-set lapse to seal a two-hour, 10-minute win. ‚ÄúI have to say congratulations to Raphael.
