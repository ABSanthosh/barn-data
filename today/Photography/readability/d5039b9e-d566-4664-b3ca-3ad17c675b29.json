Sports photographers and wildlife photographers might be very excited about the lens. https://www.canonrumors.com/sigma-ceo-teases-never-before-seen-telephoto-lens/It looks like that lens will be an 800mm f/6.3 DG DN OS. Which wouldn’t qualify for the above statement. As Nikon has the NIKKOR Z 800mm f/6.3 VR S. The Nikon lens does a Phase Fresnel element. Which is sort of Canon using Diffractive Optics elements in some lenses to reduce size and weight.The Nikon also launched with an MSRP of $6496, and I would imaging the SIGMA is going to be much more affordable.So maybe the new SIGMA still qualifies as “something that has never existed before”.SIGMA did offer a 300-800mm f/5.6 EX APO DG HSM many years ago in the DSLR days. It was a 13lbs monster that wasn’t that much fun to use. Optically it was fine.However, SIGMA is also rumored to be announcing a new zoom lens, but there is no information about that lens at this time.800mm lenses are impressive and fun to use, but it’s such a specialized focal length. I’m not sure it’s really all that exciting, but maybe SIGMA has done something that will make us perk up.We do not expect to see an RF version of the SIGMA 800mm f/6.3 DG DN OS.Canon has two 800mm options in their lineup, the RF 800mm f/5.6L IS USM and the RF 200-800 f/6.3 IS USM. Both are great options, but something in the middle price wise would probably be a welcomed addition to the RF lineup.Sony is getting into the 800mm game shortly with an FE 400-800mm f/6.3-8.0 G series lens. It’s rumored to be around €3500.Source: Mirrorless RumorsWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
