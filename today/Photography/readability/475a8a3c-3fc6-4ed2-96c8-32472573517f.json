Obviously depending on where you are in the world.We knew more VCM lenses were coming, just not in the near-term. That has proven to be a nice surprise.Canon will announce the RF 20mm f/1.4L VCM next week, with availability coming relatively soon after. There are more VCM lenses planned for this year, and there’s real hope that Canon will finally make a 28mm f/1.4L VCM this year. I don’t know why I do it to myselfWe currently have the RF 24mm f/1.4L VCM, RF 35mm f/1.4L VCM and RF 50mm f/1.4L VCM. All these lenses are nearly identical in size and the RF 20mm f/1.4L VCM will follow the same sort of design. We expect the new VCM lens to cost more than $1499.We believe that a patent from back in January shows us the optical design of the RF 20mm f/1.4L VCM.Canon RF 24mm f/1.4L VCMThe VCM series of L prime lenses have become a bit polarizing, but we think the series is unique, affordable and have great optical performance outside of the distortion on the two wider lenses.There are always compromises when you must hit a price point and in the case of the current trio, matching the sizes.Love them or hate them, Canon will continue to develop the VCM and Z line of lenses and it looks like new internal Power Zoom RF-S lenses.Are More VCM Lenses Planned?Is going wider than 20mm a possibility? We’d think that there would be some challenges keeping the lens the same size, especially at the 1.4 aperture, but anything is possible.A VCM longer than the RF 50mm f/1.4L VCM has been rumored for a while, however we haven’t seen a lot of evidence for such a lens. We have seen patents for RF 85mm L lenses, but they appear to be USM and not VCM.Though the size of the RF 85mm f/1.8L IS optical design in a recent patent lines up pretty well with the current VCM lenses.Canon RF 50mm f/1.4L VCMNew RF-S LensThe Canon EOS R50 V will be announced next week, and it looks like it’ll be kitted with a new RF-S lens. We don’t think the lens is going to excite the enthusiasts here, but the target market will probably like it just fine. It’s not very expensive on its own.It looks like it’s going to be an RF-S 15-30mm with a built-in Power Zoom, though I cannot confirm with 100% certainty on the Power Zoom feature.We have seen a patent recently showcasing small VCM motors for internal Power Zoom lens design.It may be the lens attached to the Canon EOS RV leak from a couple of weeks ago.What About the Canon EOS RV?This one has us stumped a bit on when we can expect it to arrive. We don’t think Canon would badge the EOS R50 V with simply “EOS RV” in the above leak. Stranger things have happened though.If the EOS RV is indeed a more advanced APS-C camera, it may deserve its own day in the sun.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
