Then with special software that is developed into 3D video.As it stands right now, Canon has two VR Dual Lenses, one for APS-C and the other for full frame cameras.Canon RF 5.2mm f/2.8 L Dual Fisheye 3D VR LensRF-Mount Lens/Full-Frame FormatAperture Range: f/2.8 to f/16Captures Stereoscopic 3D 180° VR imageryTwo Ultra-Low Dispersion ElementsSuper-Spectra \u0026 Sub-Wavelength CoatingsFluorine CoatingWeather-Sealed Construction7-Blade DiaphragmCanon RF-S 3.9mm f/3.5 STM Dual Fisheye LensCompatible with EOS R7 Mirrorless CameraAPS-C | f/3.5 to f/16High-Quality VR Content Creation6.2mm (Full-Frame Equivalent)Captures Stereoscopic 3D 180° VR ImagerySTM Stepping Autofocus Motor144° Field of ViewAir Sphere Coating7-Blade Diaphragm30.5mm Rear Filter ThreadEven from the two images shown above you can see that Canon has gone through an evolutionary step with the adjust now situated on the left hand side on the newer RF-S 3.9mm.
