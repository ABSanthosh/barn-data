SIGMA 28-70mm f/2.8 DG DN | ContemporaryFinding Your Perfect Lens SIGMA’s success is often tied to its unwavering commitment to quality and value. Every SIGMA lens reflects a meticulous design philosophy that prioritizes optical excellence, durability, and usability. Lens features such as advanced coatings, sophisticated lens elements, and superior autofocus capabilities provide unmatched value for photographers seeking reliability coupled with exceptional image quality. SIGMA’s state-of-the-art factory in Aizu, Japan, is the heart of its manufacturing operations. Aside from a small number of processes, almost every aspect of SIGMA lens manufacturing takes place inside this factory. By maintaining production in Japan, SIGMA not only preserves its heritage but also ensures that every lens meets the company’s high standards, solidifying its reputation as a leader in optical innovation. SIGMA lenses are truly ‘Made in Japan.’ With dozens of lenses available for modern cameras, we have compiled a list of SIGMA lenses that best fit for a variety of photography genres. First, it’s important to understand the differences between SIGMA’s Art, Contemporary, and Sports lens lines. Art lenses provide the sharpest, most detailed image quality. Contemporary lenses, while not quite as sharp as Art lenses, provide high quality images in a more compact package. The Sports lenses deliver rugged lenses that provide a fast aperture and autofocus system, ideal for fast moving action. Additionally, SIGMA lenses are marked with one of three designations which point to the type of camera system it can be used with. DC: Designed for APS-C (crop sensor) cameras. DN: Designed for mirrorless cameras (full-frame and APS-C). DG: Designed for full-frame cameras (can also be used on APS-C). To help you find the perfect optic for your needs, this guide is organized by shooting genre, highlighting the top SIGMA lenses for every type of photographer. Landscape Photography: Capturing the Beauty of the Great Outdoors Landscape photography is the art of capturing the world around us, from sweeping mountain ranges to serene coastal scenes. Great lenses for this genre typically offer exceptional sharpness across the entire frame to render fine details, often feature wider focal lengths to encompass broad vistas, and possess robust weather sealing to withstand unpredictable outdoor conditions. While zoom lenses provide versatility, prime lenses are often favored for their ultimate image quality and wider maximum apertures, which can be beneficial for low-light situations like dawn, dusk, or even astro-landscapes. 1.

Portrait Photography: Capturing the Human Element Portrait photography is about capturing the character, personality, and mood of a person. The best portrait lenses help a photographer achieve this by creating a flattering perspective and separating the subject from their background. This is typically accomplished with short-telephoto focal lengths (from 50mm to 135mm) that don’t distort features, and very wide maximum apertures (like f/1.8 or f/1.4) that produce a beautifully blurred background, often called ‘bokeh,’ making the subject the clear focus of the image. 1.

Macro Photography: Revealing the Unseen World Macro photography is the art of capturing extreme close-up images, revealing intricate details in subjects that are often invisible to the naked eye. A true macro lens is defined by its ability to achieve a 1:1 magnification ratio, which means it can project an image of a subject onto the camera’s sensor at its actual life size. Beyond magnification, the best macro lenses deliver outstanding sharpness to resolve the finest textures, and their focal length determines the “working distance”—the space between the lens and the subject—which is a critical factor when photographing live insects or small, easily disturbed subjects. 1.

Its compact nature also makes it a surprisingly versatile lens for everyday shooting. Videography: Lenses for the Modern Filmmaker Lenses designed for videography must meet a unique set of demands. Smooth, silent, and accurate autofocus is critical for tracking subjects without distracting noise or jerky movements. Minimal focus breathing—a distracting shift in the field of view when focus is adjusted—is a hallmark of a high-quality video lens. For zooms, a constant maximum aperture is essential for maintaining consistent exposure while changing focal lengths. And for primes, a fast aperture like f/1.4 is invaluable for creating cinematic shallow depth of field and for performing in low-light scenarios. 1.

Minimal focus breathing—a distracting shift in the field of view when focus is adjusted—is a hallmark of a high-quality video lens. For zooms, a constant maximum aperture is essential for maintaining consistent exposure while changing focal lengths. And for primes, a fast aperture like f/1.4 is invaluable for creating cinematic shallow depth of field and for performing in low-light scenarios.\u003c/p\u003e \u003chr/\u003e \u003ch3\u003e1. \u003ca href=\"https://www.sigmaphoto.com/24-70mm-f2-8-dg-dn-a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener follow external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"\u003eSIGMA 24-70mm f/2.8 DG DN | Art\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBest For:\u003c/strong\u003e The Professional’s Video Workhorse\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy It’s Great for Video:\u003c/strong\u003e This lens is the cornerstone of many professional video kits.
