  "text": "One of the most asked questions that we get here at Canon Rumors is whether there will be an EOS R5 C Mark II? We have spent a fair bit of time over the last while figuring out if we’ll indeed see one this year or in the future. We have been told by a couple of people that Canon will not be doing a Mark II version of the EOS R5 C. I don’t think this should be much of a surprise considering how capable the EOS R5 Mark II is. Well, bugs aside that Canon needs to fix ASAP. Canon Cinema EOS C80 New Cinema EOS Cameras One source said that there is a Cinema EOS camera that will take the place of the EOS R5 C. We don’t know what the model’s name is or what it will be, but it will be below the Cinema EOS C80 and Cinema EOS C400. There will be Cinema EOS announcements before September, and a lot of them. We may see them ahead of the IBC trade show, which takes place in Amsterdam in September. There are 3 new Cinema EOS cameras coming this year, as well as new cinema lenses. Summary There will be people that wanted a follow-up to the EOS R5 C, but we have always felt that the camera was a stopgap to see how it was received and to make more money off the EOS R5 concept. They do share 90% of the hardware. Canon is going to pivot their Cinema EOS lineup; it sounds like they realize they aren’t Sony or ARRI and will take a different approach to growing their market share in the space. We don’t think Nikon is going to do much with the RED brand, and what it sold for? It’s obviously not a brand that matters. There is room for Canon to grow with Cinema EOS, but they must do things that others don’t offer and pick their demographic correctly. We hope to be able to tell you about the new Cinema EOS cameras soon. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works. Go to discussion...
