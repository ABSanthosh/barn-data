So, the next time you’re being driven to a shoot or on a train to a location you’re planning to capture, we thought we’d give you some inspiration to play some games on your phone on your way. So put down your Canon and pick up your phone.In online game design, multiple elements have to fit together and amplify each other. Some players tend to focus on playability and fair chances to win, but they risk to ignore one of the most important pillars of great user experience – the visuals. Well-conceived and well-executed graphics mean more than just good looks, as they impact engagement and add to the game’s identity. Since there are so many options to choose from, it makes no sense to settle for a game that is just ordinary in a visual sense.If you are one of the players who appreciate finding a beautifully designed slot game online, the following recommendations should be right up your alley.Gonzo’s QuestThis NetEnt game has proven to be very durable, as it was launched in 2011 but remains very popular to this day. The immersive graphic theme that takes the player through the ruins of the Mayan cities in search of the legendary El Dorado is certainly one of the primary reasons behind its incredible longevity. From backgrounds and reels to details that enrich the gameplay, everything in this game is flawless. Watching the reels made of stone spin is very satisfying, especially when coupled with audio. Of course, this slot has other qualities too, for example x 37,500 max win and lots of free spins and multipliers.FranksylvaniaPlayers who prefer darker themes will be thrilled to discover Franksylvania. This horror-themed slot game takes place in a world inhabited by vampires, with the appropriate aesthetic is consistently applied across all features. Despite depicting a scary narrative, the design is playful enough to keep things lighthearted. Animations are the aspect of visual design that pushes this game to the top of the list, as they tell the story in a stylistically very polished way. If you decide to give this game a chance, you can count on a solid 96% RTP and high volatility.Valley of the GodsWell-known game studio Yggdrasil did some amazing work on this slot game based on ancient Egypt. It has a well-rounded look and feel that uses both graphics and audio to deliver a strong thematic punch. The design is not flashy, but it draws from Egyptian history to deliver a consistent and slightly exotic visual thrill. All of the symbols are replicas of authentic elements from this historical culture including the scarab bug which has a special significance in the game. As a moderately volatile slot with RTP% of 96%, this is a solid choice for players who enjoy value propositions.StarburstThis is another celebrated game from NetEnt famous for its classic look that never goes out of style. The main theme is outer space, but instead of trying to look super futuristic the game brings back memories of the arcade era. Its design is minimalistic to the core and the symbols are fairly simple depictions of jewels, which in combination with a bright grid and a dark background makes the action very easy to follow. This game has originally hit the market way back in 2012, but its interface has been redesigned since to keep up with the times.Pandastic AdventurePlaying Pandastic Adventure by Play’N GO is like stepping into a mystical world full of surprises. The overall graphic theme is inspired by Asian aesthetics, but it doesn’t go overboard with this stylistic reference. The game uses beautiful fonts and skillfully designed symbols made out of bamboo, with idyllic scenes of nature providing the backdrop. This serenity is occasionally punctuated by animated sequences to keep things interesting. This slot has medium to high volatility, which suits players who have a tolerance for risk.Thunderstruck IIMade as a sequel to the early hit from Microgaming, Thunderstruck II takes the player to the far North and lets him brush shoulders with powerful Norse gods. Its cinematic-level graphics represent one of the biggest reasons why this game has outshined the first installment and gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful and enjoyable slots ever. Animations and audio effects are perfectly integrated into the game and add to its unique atmosphere. The game has an above-average RTP of 96.5% and a wide array of bonus features, so it has just as much substance as style.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.",
