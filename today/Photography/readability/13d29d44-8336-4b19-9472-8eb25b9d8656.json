In an early spring afternoon in Shuangliu Ancient Town, Sichuan Province, China, five elderly ladies in their eighties sit together. Wearing colourful jackets and wool hats, they happily eat the famous Sichuan snack ‘Spring rolls’. A wrap of thin homemade dough, filled with cucumber, carrot, and shredded scallions, drizzled with green mustard, Sichuan pepper, red oil, sweet sauce, and sprinkled with sesame seeds. They are “setting up a Dragon Gate formation” – an expression used in China to refer to neighbourhood friends coming together to chat, gossip and share stories. | Xiaoling Li/World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi® The winners of the World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi® have been announced with a group portrait of elderly women in China scooping the top prize. The heartwarming image, The Elderly Having Delicious Food, was taken by Chinese photographer Xiaoling Li and has been crowned the Overall Winner. The image, which had first won the Food for the Family supported by The Felix Project category, was taken in Shuangliu Ancient Town in the Sichuan Province of China. “The elderly ladies in the picture are ‘setting up a Dragon Gate formation’,” says photographer Xiaoling Li. “This is an expression used in China to refer to neighborhood friends coming together to chat, gossip and share stories. They eat the famous Sichuan snack ‘Spring rolls’. Food makes these people happy; they enjoy a beautiful and joyful life.” Winner of Bring Home the Harvest category. After the rice harvest, the river water filled the paddy fields, and at some point, some fish from the river ended up here too. After school, the two children went to the field together to catch fish with their covers. Approaching quietly, leaping vigorously, and pouncing towards the target. | Chang Jiangbin/World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi® Winner of the Champagne Taittinger Wedding Food Photographer category.

A layered tale of resilience and community. | Kazi Mushfiq/World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi® Winner of The Philip Harben Award for Food in Action supported by International Salon Culinaire. Fresh pasta is a symbol that represents the cultural richness of the Italian territory. An image of its processing becomes a means to telling history, traditions and centuries-old passions.

This is one of the results. | Pieter D’Hoop/World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi® Winner of the Marks \u0026 Spencer Food Portraiture award. A drizzle of olive oil, oven at 180°C, salt and pepper, 10 minutes… delicious and so crispy. | Simon Détraz/World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi® Winner of the Hotel Art Group Food Stylist Award.

Exploring how ingredients could be styled in playful and innovative ways – a spaghetti strand maze guarding a delicious meatball at its center. | Costas Millas/World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi® Winner of the Hotel Art Group Food Stylist Award. Part of a wider food story concept titled Spaghetti. A bold and fun capture brings to life the saying in the image title and the self-imposed challenge of styling a broken plate of food on the floor and still making it appetizing and appealing. | Costas Millas/World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi® Winner of the Fortnum \u0026 Mason Food at the Table category.

They will eat anything, including my flash diffuser. | Susan Lang/World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi® Errazuriz Wine Photographer of the Year – Places. This image, taken in July 2024, captures a vineyard in Oltrepò Pavese, a historical region in the province of Pavia in Lombardy, Italy. The trees on the road act as a backdrop to emphasize the scene in its natural and, at the same time, anthropized beauty. | Alessandro Anglisani/World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi® Overall Winner of Errazuriz Wine Photographer of the Year (and People sub-category). Under the glow of a tractor’s lights, vineyard workers handpick Pinot Noir in the cool, misty midnight air at Sanford \u0026 Benedict Vineyard in Sta. Rita Hills, an American Viticultural Area (AVA) located at the western end of the Santa Ynez Valley in California’s Central Coast wine region. One worker adds his contribution to the back of the tractor, a cascade of Pinot Noir falling from his picking bin. | Heather Daenitz/World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi® Winner of the Cream of the Crop category. Part of the series ‘Perfectly Imperfect’ where I captured the process of baking sourdough bread while incorporating the symbolism of the Japanese Ensō sign (imperfect circle).
