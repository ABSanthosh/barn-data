So we missed the mark on this one. We have seen an updated firmware version installed on an EOS R1, and we think it’s likely beta software in testing. However, we haven’t seen anything in regards to the EOS R5 Mark II.Canon EOS R5 Mark IIOne of the big issues for EOS R5 Mark II shooters is battery performance in moderate to extreme cold. The camera will show that the battery is fully charged, but the camera will die almost instantly. A lot of the time this is corrected by simply removing the battery and re-inserting it.We have been able to verify the issue with the battery in those types of conditions.However, that’s a big bug and there could be something deeper than a simple software fix. An issue with the battery would likely delay any sort of feature updates. We don’t know this for certain, but it makes sense to us.The Red Circle Shows A Part of the Content Authorization System Built Into the EOS R1We don’t know exactly how the EOS R1 authentication system is going to be implemented, so we can’t really comment about the scope of such an update. This coming feature will meet C2PA standard and Canon is directly working with the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI). It feels like a feature that should already exist in professional Canon camera bodies.For now, we’ll keep waiting and apologize for getting your hopes up. We also wanted to see firmware sooner than later for both cameras.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
