The People's Choice Winner is selected by a vote of the community, whereas our guest judge selects the overall winner. The “Symmetry and Asymmetry” photo contest in November saw many interesting images where the participants used their creative vision and thoughts to capture and submit photos. Entries included photos that showed symmetry and asymmetry in nature as well as some brilliant manmade structures and still-life objects too. When choosing the winning photos, we wanted to make sure that the decision process was based on a good interpretation of the theme followed by other factors like light, composition, story, details, creative vision and thought, etc. The results are entirely subjective and there are no losers in any competition as we all know.  Here are November's winners: First Place: “Organized Imbalance” by Pat Garrett Organized Imbalance – Copyright Pat Garrett This photo “Organized Imbalance” by Pat strikes off as a perfect photo that portrays asymmetrical balance – a technique where the photo feels balanced even when it has unequal sides. Pat has carefully framed the shot by balancing elements in the one third and two thirds part of the frame vertically / off center and on the one third part horizontally. This framing technique has created a sense of balance in the asymmetrical image. The light although slightly hard, has helped to capture some shadows that help to add depth to the image. The textures in the walls and the windows are recognizable, with the shadows adding more visual interest to the photo. Pat may have spent some time here trying a few compositions before deciding on this result. The black and white treatment has helped the viewer to focus on just the “lines and shapes” and the “light and shadows” in the image. Great work and creative execution by Pat and congratulations on the win! Second Place: “Orchid Mantis” by Tersha Orchid mantis – Copyright Tersha In this brilliant shot, Tersha has included both symmetry and asymmetry. The orchid mantis on the orchid flower, almost looks like it’s there to steal the show. The beauty of the orchid flower is captured in a symmetrical way, but the mantis breaking the symmetry and adding to the story makes the photo more visually interesting. The mantis isn't too distracting either, so it doesn't take attention away from the flower. When it comes to photography, capturing the color white can be quite a challenge, but Tersha has made it look easy in this stunning photo. The lighting is perfect – a soft but bright light that perfectly illuminates the flower and reveals the textures, details and colours. The choice of background, along with the lighting, makes the flower and the mantis stand out in the image. This is a beautiful photo and I can only imagine how much time Tersha must have spent executing this shot to make sure it was perfect. Congratulations Tersha, on this stunning well executed shot. Third Place: “Corner” by Jean T Lodging building in Montréal, Québec – Copyright Jean T This creative photo captured by Jean could have been a slightly symmetrical shot if the photographer had decided to capture it that way. Jean cleverly moved around to capture an asymmetrical shot of this architectural structure and the imbalance created as a result has worked well for this image. This is a perfect example of a shot that can give you different results when you move around and change angles and perspectives. Despite being taken on a lightly overcast day, there’s enough detail to be seen in both the sky and the building. Even the building’s patterns are neither even nor symmetrical. Jean has captured this slightly asymmetrical structure from an angle that highlights its symmetry, yet in an asymmetrical way, which is simply brilliant. Congratulations Jean! People's Choice Award Winner Our monthly photo contests also come with a People's Choice Award. The winner of this part of the contest receives $100 worth of store credit on Lightstalking which they can spend as they please on our blueprints, drills, courses or Presets. “Nut and Bolt” by Frogdaily Nut and Bolt – Copyright Frogdaily The most popular photo for November, voted by the contestants was “Nut and Bolt” by Frogdaily, which has won the people's choice award. This is a very simple still life photo that has made use of symmetry and asymmetry in a very clever way. The light and the background complement the subject and help it stand out. Congratulations Frogdaily on the win! We're already into the second week of December and our monthly contest has already started taking entries with a lot of interesting submissions already. This month our theme is Light And Shadow Play. If you would like to join and enter some images into our monthly contest then take a look at your options here.",
