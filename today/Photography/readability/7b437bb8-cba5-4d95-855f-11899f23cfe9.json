Photo by Tom Winckels But we have to admit, more often than not, these people display some really disturbing content. Today’s headline is no different. An influencer from the United States is under arrest in India for attempting to contact the Sentinelese, an isolated tribe, and, after failing to do so, leaving them a coconut and Diet Coke – potentially exposing any Sentinelese that stumbles upon the items to a range of diseases for which they have no immunity.  And it wasn’t the first time Mykhailo Viktorovych Polyakov tried to do this. He was stopped on previous attempts, but this time succeeded apparently because of meticulous planning, PetaPixel reports.  The people on the island have reportedly lived in isolation for what some believe could be 50,000 years and survive using a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. He was charged with violating laws intended to protect tribes such as the Sentinelese and faces up to 5 years in prison if convicted. Again, given his determination and multiple attempts, we expect that there will be some kind of punishment, if for no other reason than to deter people from trying this in the future.  One also has to wonder who the audience for this kind of content could possibly be. There seems to be a shock factor element that is borderline psychopathic in this case, considering the ramifications for this man’s actions should someone get infected with a foreign pathogen on the island.  Any thoughts that you have on this particular case or others where influencers violate the law are welcome in the comments.
