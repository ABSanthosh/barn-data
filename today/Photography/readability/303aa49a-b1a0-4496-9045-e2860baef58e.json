  "description": "What if I told you one of the best photography teachers you’ll ever have… is actually you? Yep, that’s right. In his brand-new class, Moose Peterson shows you how going back and looking at your own photos can seriously help you grow as a photographer. Moose walks you through his exact process for digging into his photo archives—not just to relive great moments, but to really study what’s working, what’s not, and how to get better. It’s honestly one of the best ways to improve your composition, your lighting, your post-processing… everything. The more photos you take, the more you’ve got this built-in library of lessons just waiting to be uncovered. It’s like leaving yourself little clues for how to become a better photographer every time you go out. And Moose is gonna show you how to spot them. This is such a simple but powerful approach, and by the end of the class, you’ll be thinking about your own work in a totally new way. You’re gonna love it. Check it out here!
