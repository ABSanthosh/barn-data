I have nothing against people making a dollar, but the prices are ridiculous.This hurts Canon’s brand, so getting this stuff gone this year will be good. This even expanded into the EOS-M, perhaps not as much in the USA, but in other regions, where an EOS-M camera sells for higher than Sony used full frame cameras. I looked around for a little M200 to use as a webcam, but that’s simply not happening. I kid you not, EOS-M 100s are more expensive than Sony A7s. M200’s? I may as well start looking for unicorns. As much as I don’t like Sony, I find all this a little hilarious.With the Powershot V1 solidly being sold as the flagship Powershot camera, there is one thing that it’s missing that Canon should consider—especially for older people (me) who like an EVF more than the back LCD for photography. The PowerShot V1 needs this.Powershot G7X Mark II with attached EVF-DC1While the EVF-DC1 is out of production, Canon would make an OLED and faster refresh version of the articulating EVF, making it a better-featured accessory. Of course, I’m assuming that Canon has video outputs on its new accessory hotshoe, but considering that feature existed in the first version of that hotshoe (on the PowerShots and EOS-M cameras) I would give it a low chance that it’s not on the newer accessory shoe that first appeared on the RF mount.I suspect that the built-in EVF didn’t make it into the Powershot V1 because of all the cooling vents. Who wants hot air to blow into their eyes when they hold the camera to their face? That doesn’t sound like a pleasant experience. However, with an articulating attachable EVF, that problem disappears somewhat, as the EVF is generally higher and further away from the camera body than an attached EVF.This would also lead to cameras of the RF line being able to use an EVF, such as smaller M6 or M200-styled RF cameras that I want to see in the RF lineup. Also, there are times when a flip-up EVF, even on a camera with a viewfinder, is just useful.Canon could also simplify my life by allowing an off-camera shoe cord to pass through video and having a hot shoe on top of the EVF, similar to the Fuji EVF.Fujifiilm’s EVF-GFX for the GFX Series CamerasThis was one of my annoyances with the EOS-M M6 Mark II when I wanted to use both a hotshoe-based flash and the EVF. Not happenin’Canon – there’s a problem here.Yes, that’s a SIGMA 56mm F1.4 DC DN Contemporary on my M6 Mark II. It’s just an amazing little lens. If you want an 85mm equivalent for your RF APS-C cameras, I highly recommend it. The M6 Mark II, with its 32.5MP sensor, demands excellent optics and Sigma delivered in spades. The flash was a Godox tt350c, which is a great compact flash that suits the smaller camera body. But I digress down memory lane.The Powershot V1 is pretty much otherwise a camera that, photography-wise, is “on the buy list.” My only reservation is that we haven’t seen how much in-camera trickery Canon uses to get down to 16mm equivalent in such a small camera. But if the optics are good, we already know that the dynamic range and noise response, assuming it’s a cut-down R7 sensor, should be good as well.PhotonsToPhotos EOS R7 vs Sony A6700Bill’s excellent resources at photonstophotos show that the R7 left little to be desired in terms of dynamic range compared to even the latest Sony sensor generation.The 16-50mm focal range is a bit limited on the telephoto end for my uses, but 24MP will allow some cropping if I cannot zoom with my feet. What is impossible to zoom, though, is more on the ultra-wide end, and the 16mm sounds perfect for me. So I will happily trade the longer end for wider than 24mm. Everyone, of course, has different needs. While I would normally gravitate to a small mirrorless ILC camera, I’m not going to get any camera and lens combination that goes down to 16mm equivalent in the same size or weight. I know some will point to the EOS R8 and RF 16mm f/2.8 STM combination, but that is still around 630g and far larger. Not to mention that the R8 and 16mm is nearly twice the price at $1800 MSRP (on sale now for $1598)The Powershot V1 isn’t a small camera. But ti’s small enough.For me, and when travelling around Asia, it’s highly useful to save even hundreds of grams of carry-on weight when we are limited to 7kg (around 15.4 freedom pounds). Most decent carry-on bags or cases weigh around 1.5kg, which consumes over 20% of that 7kg before you even put anything into it.Another thing I appreciate about the Powershot V1 is the battery. It uses the LP-E17 battery, which is the smallest of Canon’s interchangeable lens camera batteries. This allows for immediate access to a range of battery-related accessories for this camera.K\u0026F Concept Dual LP-E17 USB ChargerFor example, if I didn’t already have one, I would immediately buy a dual LP-E17 charger that works off USB power.While I’m liking what I’m seeing from the PowerShot, there are some things I wish they did a little differently. For such a large compact camera, the controls are very rudimentary. We are missing at least one dial on the camera. But I didn’t find the EOS-M that onerous to use after a while, so I don’t think that will be personally a problem for me. But it should have had some more external controls.Powershot V1 – No external controlsThis other feature missing, may be added to the firmware in the future or before the global release. It doesn’t affect me, but it’s curious about its omission. The camera, for all its video chops, has no high frame rate or slow-motion video options. It’s limited to a fasted frame rate of 60 frames per second.More information about it will be available after CP+, which is held in Japan from February 27 to March 2. The global announcement of the PowerShot V1 is expected to happen in April.How about everyone else? What do you all want besides having a 10-100mm F1.0 lens? What could be added to the ecosystem to make it better for you?When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",

For such a large compact camera, the controls are very rudimentary.  We are missing at least one dial on the camera.  But I didn’t find the EOS-M that onerous to use after a while, so I don’t think that will be personally a problem for me.  But it should have had some more external controls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIzMzgiIGhlaWdodD0iMTQ5IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMzM4IDE0OSI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"338\" height=\"149\" data-src=\"https://www.canonrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-100.png\" alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://www.canonrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-100.png 338w, https://www.canonrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-100-150x66.png 150w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003ePowershot V1 – No external controls\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis other feature missing, may be added to the firmware in the future or before the global release. It doesn’t affect me, but it’s curious about its omission.  The camera, for all its video chops, has no high frame rate or slow-motion video options.   It’s limited to a fasted frame rate of 60 frames per second.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore information about it will be available after CP+, which is held in Japan from February 27 to March 2. The global announcement of the PowerShot V1 is expected to happen in April.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow about everyone else? What do you all want besides having a 10-100mm F1.0 lens?
