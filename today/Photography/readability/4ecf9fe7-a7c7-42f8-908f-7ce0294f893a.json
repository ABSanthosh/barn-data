Photo by Solen Feyissa And not only that, but this AI can view the world as you see it in real time through your phone. That means it can look at screens, your surroundings, or wherever you point your lens. It’s definitely a huge next step for consumer smartphones, and a somewhat gigantic leap in general. After all, this opens the door to putting AI in everything and we’re pretty certain nothing will be the same. First spotted on Reddit on a user’s Xiaomi device, this follows Google’s promises to integrate AI into its devices, The Verge reports, citing project Astra. An example cited by the website and used in a YouTube video is asking the AI to help with a matching paint color but the real-world use cases are well beyond just that. Citing Apple’s Siri, The Verge notes this could be the first in a broader move to not only put AI into everything but also replace the somewhat lacking voice assistants we currently have with something a little more functional (we’re looking at you Siri). We’ve also covered stories about AI being integrated directly into more traditional cameras as well. What impact this will have on the art remains to be seen but it could be interesting from a technical standpoint. Whether photographers will want more or less control over certain things will also probably be an issue front and center with AI. Of course, we’ll keep you updated as things progress.
