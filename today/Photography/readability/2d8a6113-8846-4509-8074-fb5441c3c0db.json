However, when they first arrived, and as they developed, they posed a real risk to other industries.The biggest of these was related to cameras. For decades, Canon had dominated the space, with the likes of high-end DSLRs, mirrorless cameras and compact point-and-shoot models. However, as the cameras on smartphones began to improve, consumer behaviour shifted significantly.Suddenly, Canon, as well as other makers of traditional cameras, were faced with a stark choice: either evolve, at pace, or lose all relevance.The Smartphone Revolution At the start, smartphones were simply seen as convenient communication devices. However, they soon began to develop and were then seen as powerful multimedia tools. The likes of Apple, Samsung, and Google soon started to prioritise camera quality, and it was this that used to set smartphones apart. Developers later tapped into AI-driven computational photography, multiple lens systems, and superior software processing.Early on in this journey, there was a huge decline in point-and-shoot camera sales. This was an area that Canon had dominated and this was a significant loss. With smartphones becoming more accessible, and with the camera quality getting better and better, there was no need for casual users to invest in a separate digital camera.Canon had invested heavily in its compact cameras and watched as sales pretty much died while users opted for the convenience offered by smartphones.Canon’s Initial StrugglesAs consumers began to opt for smartphones, dedicated cameras were soon obsolete for the average user. Initially, Canon showed no sign of adapting and lacked any sort of pivot. Instead, it continued to focus on its DSLR and mirrorless categories in an attempt to retain professional photographers as its customer base.There’s no doubt that this strategy kept Canon relevant, but only in the high-end market. There was a complete failure to address the needs of the everyday user, the majority of which had now made the move to smartphones. Canon also underestimated just how quickly mobile imaging technology would develop. The likes of Night Mode, portrait enhancements, and AI-driven improvements meant that smartphones were able to close the gap that had existed between them and traditional cameras. Canon was soon in a less than ideal position, with a need to redefine its approach if it was to have any chance of survival.Shifting to Mirrorless and Hybrid CamerasWhen Canon realised the real risk that smartphones posed, it began to move its focus towards mirrorless cameras. These models tried to appeal to smartphone users by being more compact but without any loss in image quality.The EOS R series was released in 2018. This was a direct response for an increase in demand for high-performance cameras that were able to complement, rather than compete with, smartphones.Canon also began to integrate features into its cameras that would appeal to content creators and hybrid users (the latter being those who were using both smartphones and cameras). New Canon models were now known for the likes of autofocus improvements, superior video capabilities, and seamless smartphone connectivity.The use of bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity means that users were now able to transfer images at speed, and this bridged the gap between professional cameras and the desire to share on social media.Embracing Video and Content CreationJust as online casinos had to embrace the explosion in live dealer games and an increased game selection by partnering with casino games aggregators such as hub88.io, Canon had to deal with the rapid interest in video content creation.Here, it was platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram that were encouraging users to create high-quality video content. It was smartphones that led the charge thanks to their accessibility and ease of use. Canon took no0te, and responded by enhancing its video features so that it would appeal to vloggers and streamers. The Canon EOS M50 is a great example here. This model was designed with vloggers in mind, with a flip-out screen, excellent autofocus, and 4k quality. The company also made significant improvements to its software so that it became easier for users to stream directly from their cameras. This was hugely important during the rise of the live streaming culture.Competing with Smartphone Convenience It was clear to Canon that competing with smartphones went beyond a focus on hardware or software. Instead, it was all about the user experience and the levels of convenience that smartphones offered.With a smartphone, photography was suddenly easy with instant adjustments and instant sharing. Canon responded to this by improving its user interface, adding touchscreens and developing apps that simplified the process of transferring and editing images on mobile devices. Canon also explored new product categories that sought to blend the convenience of smartphones with high-quality optics. The Canon Powershot Zoom is a great example here. This was developed to offer something that smartphones couldn’t: optical zoom in an ultra-portable zoom.Canon’s Future Looking ahead, the future looks promising for Canon and we can be sure that it will continue to adapt. New technologies, such as augmented reality and virtual reality, mean that the company will move towards new imaging technologies that go beyond traditional photography. There’s also the possibility that Canon will continue to explore AI capabilities so that it can integrate more intelligent processing into its cameras. We’d also expect Canon to streamline its lineup and perhaps completely move away from traditional DSLRs.Final Thoughts There’s no doubt that smartphones forced Canon to completely rethink its approach to camera technology. While change may have been resisted at the start, the company soon embraced this and, in fact, the competition offered by smartphones actually led Canon launching products that were better than ever before. The way that it tapped into trends created by social media means that it has maintained its relevance and there will long be a need for its offerings.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.",
