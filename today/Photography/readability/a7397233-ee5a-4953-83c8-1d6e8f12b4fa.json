  "description": "Wouldnâ€™t ya know it â€“Â I slip down to Antarctica for a few weeks, and Adobe goes and releases some Lightroom updates (thanks for covering them here, Rob). Well, Iâ€™m finally back, and it was an absolutely incredible tripâ€”just incredible! I have so much to share and so many photos yet to go through (I caught a nasty cold about halfway through the trip and didnâ€™t get to work on my images the way I would have hoped), but Iâ€™m back in the saddle now and hope to share an Adobe Express page next week with images and stories from the trip. There were 12 Pro Instructors in the workshop, including yours truly (the workshop was produced by the great folks at Muench Workshops â€“ absolutely top flight from beginning to end), so I got to see lots of different Lightroom and Photoshop workflows in their presentations to the workshop participants on board. Itâ€™s always so interesting to see how different these workflows can be, from ones that rely on no global adjustments whatsoever (the entire workflow is nothing but local adjustments), to workflows where 95% of the image editing is all on in the Tone Curve, so workflows that donâ€™t use Lightroom at all. When you see these different workflows, it gives you an opportunity to consider taking one part from one workflow, one part from another, and add them to (or change them from) the workflow youâ€™re currently using, and thatâ€™s a really cool thing. Anyway, I just wanted to touch base and let you know Iâ€™m back, and letâ€™s catch up next week. It was a mind-blowing trip, but itâ€™s always great to be back home. Have a great weekend, everybody. ðŸ™‚ -Scott The post Iâ€™m Back From Antarctica appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",
