  "text": "Canon’s EOS 7D series once held a proud spot in the bags of wildlife and action shooters — a true “baby 1D” for those who needed flagship performance with reach. And now, rumors are swirling that the Canon EOS R7 Mark II might pick up that mantle. In February, it was suggested on this site that the R7 Mark II II would deliver something like a baby R1. “The EOS R7 Mark II will potentially be something like a baby EOS R1 with an APS-C sensor. During the EF days, the Canon EOS 7D series was pretty close to a baby version of the EOS-1D X line. We’d love to see that return to the lineup.” So what should we really expect? Are we getting 8K, 40fps, Canon Log 2 and a stacked sensor in a sub-$2,000 body? Or is that just wishful thinking? A New Sensor — But Not That New One of the biggest points of debate has been the sensor. A drop from 32.5MP to 24MP would alienate many wildlife shooters who rely on that reach and detail. And a 40MP stacked APS-C sensor? It seems too close to the R5 Mark II for Canon to try this. The realistic answer is a brand-new stacked, backside-illuminated 32.5MP sensor. It keeps resolution where it needs to be, but finally solves the rolling shutter issues that plagued the original R7’s 30fps burst mode. The R7 Mark II needs faster read out speeds, not more resolution. Speed, Buffer \u0026 Autofocus: A Real Flagship? With a stacked sensor and the Digic X + Digic Accelerator combo first seen in the R5 Mark II, expect electronic burst speeds of up to 40fps, though 30 fps is more than enough. The real concern is the buffer. Canon must improve the buffer this time around. 30fps didn’t mean much when you filled the buffer in one second. With faster memory and processing, the R7 Mark II should hold its own — especially if Canon introduces CFexpress Type B support. The new DIGIC Accelerator chip boosts AI autofocus, enabling predictive subject tracking that should improve on the Mark I’s occasional focus misses — especially in birds-in-flight scenarios. Video Specs: Canon’s Not Giving Away the Farm Rumors about 8K video, Canon Log 2, and 40MP capture? Let’s be honest: these are R5 Mark II-class specs, and Canon doesn’t cannibalize its own pro bodies. More probable specs: Oversampled 7K → 4K 60p (from the 32.5MP sensor) 4K 120p with some crop 10-bit 4:2:2 in most modes Canon Log 3 (not Log 2) Improved heat management, but no active cooling And while 240fps in 1080p would be great for ultra-slow-motion wildlife work, Canon tends to reserve that for high-end cameras — and when it does appear, image quality often suffers. Expect better 4K, not gimmicky slow-mo. Ergonomics, LCD, and Build The R7 II will likely inherit the R5 Mark II’s ergonomics: improved grip, better control layout, and hopefully a refined AF joystick (a common complaint on the original R7). A battery grip option would be a welcome bonus especially if it supports cooling. The EVF could see a jump to 5.76M dots, pulled from the R5 Mark I, with improved refresh rate. As for the LCD, don’t expect Sony’s 4- or 5-axis tilt, but a bump in brightness and resolution is likely. What About Price and Timing? Given current tariffs and currency shifts, the R7 Mark II will almost certainly cost more than the Mark I’s $1,499 launch price, but it should still slide in under $2,000 USD. As for timing? Don’t hold your breath for a spring release. All signs point to a Q3 or Q4 launch — possibly July, August, or September — though Canon may push it into late 2025 if firmware or manufacturing isn’t fully baked.
