The recording from that live broadcast is now available, and I thought it relevant to the types of topics I write about here at Lightroom Killer Tips, so I wanted to share that with you all. I hope you find it helpful! Many thanks to Glyn for having me on as a guest! The post Photography Education and the Lightroom Help Desk (video) appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",
