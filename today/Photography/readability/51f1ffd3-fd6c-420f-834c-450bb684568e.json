It’ll probably the usual sort of stuff and there will likely be a “creator” bundle launched at some point.Both the PowerShot G7 X Mark III and PowerShot SX70 HS will be discontinued in the first half of 2025, so we expect the PowerShot V1 to hit the market some time in March or April of this year.Canon may also show one or two “concept” PowerShot cameras at CP+.Canon PowerShot V1 Specifications (Rumored)24MP CMOS (Canon Made)1.4″ 3:2 SensorDIGIC X SeriesDPAFMulti-Function ShoeApproximently 16-50mm (35mm Equivalent)3″ LCD (1 Million Pixels)Articulating Screen4K Video (Slight crop for aspect ratio)4K 60P / 1080 120P (Unconfirmed)Vertical Video CapableNew Streaming Features (No detailed information)RAW, C-RAW, Dual Pixel RAWH.265 / HEVCC-Log 3 / HDR PQA full line of accessoriesFebruary/March 2025Price: $899 USDCanon PowerShot V1 AI Concept (Not an actual product photo)When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
