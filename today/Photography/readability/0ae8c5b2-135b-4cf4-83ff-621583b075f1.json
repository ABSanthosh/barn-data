I’ve chosen this as we were sent the brand new Tamron 90mm Macro lens this week, and I’ve been out the front garden trying to get some fun macro shots – handheld! It’s a challenge. If you don’t have a Macro lens, that’s fine, just find a subject, get in close, pick out the details. There are loads of articles on our website about Macro or Close Up – Grab a cup of tea, have a read, grab your camera and go make yours. Missed focus on this little bee, below, but I love the little details the lens picked out! Hand holding up close, wide open, is hard! Make sure you include the hashtags #dPSWeeklyChallenge and #dPSTinyThings in your post, here in the comments or over on social media. You can tag us on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter! Find all of our previous weekly challenges here. Simply upload your shot into the comment field (look for the little camera icon in the Disqus comments section) and they’ll get embedded for us all to see or if you’d prefer, upload them to your favourite photo-sharing site and leave the link to them. Show me your best images in this week’s challenge. Sometimes it takes a while for an image to appear so be patient and try not to post the same image twice. Share in the dPS Facebook Group You can also share your images in the dPS Facebook group as the challenge is posted there each week as well.
