The People's Choice Winner is selected by a vote of the community, whereas our guest judge selects the overall winner. The “Color Theory In Practice” photo contest had varied images and it was interesting to see the participants' interpretation of the theme. Images submitted to the contest included varied genre like, still life, nature, landscape, architecture and abstract where contrasting complementary colors, analogous colours, etc., played a huge role. The creative thoughts and visual interpretations behind the photographs were interesting and clever and the images made use of stunning colors which was the theme of the contest. When choosing the winning photos, we wanted to make sure that the decision process was based on a good interpretation of the theme followed by other factors like light, composition, story, details, creative vision and thought, etc. The results are entirely subjective and there are no losers in any competition as we all know.  Here are January’s winners: First Place: “Two Into One” by Patrick Weir Two Into One – A study in color mixing – Copyright Patrick This very interesting photo titled “Two into One” by Patrick is a clever visual execution of color theory where the colors yellow and blue can be mixed to make the green color. These colors are found in plenty naturally and also form the basis of most designs.   I am not sure how Patrick set and captured this photo – were the hands painted? But the creative and visual process that has gone into capturing this image is just brilliant. It is almost like the yellow and blue hands are combining the two primary colors and pouring into the bowl to get the resulting secondary green color. The side lighting has helped to capture depth and textures in the image while also not blowing the brighter yellows and whites in the image. The black background makes the colors and the elements in the frame stand out! This is such a great photo that has been thought, visualised and captured well to produce the desired results. Congratulations on the win Patrick! Second Place: “Aurora” by Elin Laxdal Aurora – Copyright Elin Laxdal Elin has come up with a beautiful night landscape photo that is lit by the colorful auroral display. The colors are a combination of the analogous colors – orange, yellow and green and we can see how beautifully they work together like a gradient in the sky and the reflection in the foreground. The landscape is partially silhouetted with just the light from the aurora illuminating the beautiful landscape and the water body. The long exposure has been timed perfectly well to capture enough details so the image is correctly exposed with details preserved in both the bright and darker areas of the image. The various stars, clusters and constellations in the sky are an added bonus for this dreamscape. Night landscapes are not easy to capture, but Elin has done a wonderful job here. Congratulations Elin on this dreamy night landscape! Third Place: “On the spot” by Jean T On the Spot – Copyright Jean T Red and blue – such a perfect combination of two primary colours. Jean has captured the bright red color of the cabin against the beautiful blue sky and the waterbody, and the two colors work together to make this a very striking image. The composition also works great in this image with the lines from the foreground leading to the cabin, then giving the viewer, space to explore the background and the surrounding areas. A very stunning and neat image Jean with colors that really complement each other. Congratulations! People's Choice Award Winner Our monthly photo contests also come with a People's Choice Award. The winner of this part of the contest receives $100 worth of store credit on Lightstalking which they can spend as they please on our blueprints, drills, courses or Presets. Two Into One – A study in color mixing – Copyright Patrick The most popular photo for January, voted by the contestants was “Two Into One” by Patrick, which has won the people's choice award besides also winning the first place in the contest. Congratulations Patrick. We're already into the final week of February and our monthly contest has already seen entries with interesting submissions already. This month our theme is “Visual Metaphors.” If you would like to join and enter some images into our monthly contest then take a look at your options here.",
