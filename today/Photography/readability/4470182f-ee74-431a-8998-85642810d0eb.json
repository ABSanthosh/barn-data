Photo by Jon Moore But none are more important than keeping big creators happy and their accounts lucrative. Part of that is exclusivity, hence why Instagram and others are rolling out all of these features to keep people in tune with their audience. Call it a parasocial relationship or just call it good marketing, the need for creators to find some kind of audience and monetary outlet is greater now than ever before – especially with the rise of AI. That’s part of the motivation behind Meta’s debut of a locked post feature on Instagram. Ostensibly aimed at driving up engagement among dedicated followers, the feature can be used from everything including exclusive content to deals on promoted items. And it’s all done with a code which sounds both antiquated and cool all at the same time. Social Media Today compares it to the “Reveal” sticker that Snap debuted on their platform, which could only be removed via a DM to the creator, the website reports. Meta is going to take a more layered approach with the Instagram feature. While there are multiple ways to receive a code, that probably matters less than how many ways this can be used and if you’re thinking to offer products and service then we think you’ve probably hit the nail on the head. Engagement means dollars and that’s what keeps everything going at the end of the day. Any thoughts you might have on how social media platforms can make it easier for creators to find an audience and monetize their work are welcome in the comments.
