These camera flashes are perfect for both indoor and outdoor photography use, and come with magnetic accessories for quick switching between light effects. Image via Godox The mini flashes are almost identical with the iT20 slightly smaller than the iT22 and come in an ultra compact design and weigh only 45g (iT20) and 52g (iT22), which means they can be carried in your pocket, ready to be grabbed and used when needed. There is a dedicated button that allows the user to toggle between manual and TTL modes. Real time settings are displayed, so one can view them for any adjustments required. Image via Godox The accessories that come with the flash like the light spreader or diffuser and two color filters, are all magnetic, so they can be easily snapped on to the flash when required. There are also other optional accessories that can be purchased, like diffuser, gels and honeycomb grids which are magnetic. These accessories help with capturing creative and atmospheric effects in your photograph. Image via Godox The flash intensity can be adjusted across 6 stops in steps of 1/3. The recycling time for the flashes is 1.5s at full power and a single charge lasts more than 700 flashes. The built-in lithium battery can be charged quickly (approximately 1h 10mins) with a USB-C cable. Another optional accessory is the “Hot Shoe Riser” that helps to lift the flash by 30mm, so it has clear spread of light without blockage, when using wide angle or long lenses. There is also a 0 – 90 degrees tilt adjustment that helps to bounce light off the flash when required. The flash is compatible with Canon E-TTL II, Nikon i-TTL, Sony, Fujifilm, OM System and Panasonic TTL systems, supporting both auto flash and High-Speed sync functions. More details about the flash can be found here. The flash is available to pre-order and costs less than $50.00. We have more news for you to read if you are interested at this link here.",
