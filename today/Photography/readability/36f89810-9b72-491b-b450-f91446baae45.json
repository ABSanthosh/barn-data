  "text": "5 of the Best Cities and Locations Worldwide to Pop the Question Did you know one in four weddings is a destination wedding? The same source adds that, as of 2021, around 5,000 weddings were held daily in the U.S., which works out to over 1.9 million annually. Meanwhile, the average cost of a marriage in the U.S. was $27,100 as of 2022. If you think a destination wedding costs much more, think again. Depending on the source, a destination wedding can range from around $10,000 to $35,000. This includes travel and accommodation costs. Remember that a destination wedding doesn’t have to be an all-out extravaganza of excessive spending. It can be done affordably and create life-long memories. But if you’d rather tie the knot closer to home, there’s nothing wrong with popping the question in an exotic location overseas and, if the answer is “yes,” planning a wedding closer to home. Here are five of the best cities and places worldwide to ask your significant other to marry you. 1. Rome, Italy. Rome is one international location that should be on your shortlist if you want to pop the question overseas. While you and your significant other can soak in the rich culture and history of the city, there are also some romantic sites worth checking out. One of them is Janiculum Hill. It’s a tree-lined ridge where many a couple have shared a kiss. Yet another location is Via Margutta, located between Piazza del Popolo and Piazza di Spagna. It’s regarded as one of the city’s most romantic streets. Another must-see area is Campidoglio. The view from the Campidoglio above the Roman Forum is breathtaking — perhaps the perfect spot to pop the question. And if you invest in a romantic vacation, hiring a professional photographer for a proposal in Rome is a great way to capture the special moment. 2. Lucky Bay Beach, Australia. Do you love spending time on the beach? If so, Lucky Bay Beach in Australia won’t disappoint. The beautiful turquoise sea and white sand beaches make Lucky Bay Beach in Cape Le Grand National Park one of Australia’s most picturesque locations. You and your significant other might see kangaroos going about their business. It’s a spot that’s hard to beat. 3. Paris, France. Another great location for your wedding proposal is Paris, France. In fact, Paris is internationally known as a city for lovebirds — so much so that it’s a favorite for honeymooners. Are you wondering about options for popping the question in Paris? What about the Wall of Love in Montmartre? The wall has “I love you” written in hundreds of languages. You and your partner can try to guess the languages. Yet another place to propose is at the top of the Eiffel Tower. 4. Caño Cristales, Colombia. Yet another great place to pop the question is Caño Cristales in Colombia. It’s also known as the River of Five Colors. Situated in Serrania de la Macarena National Park, Caño Cristales boasts shades of green, black, yellow, red, and blue. The best months of the year to see these colors in their most vivid hues are from May to November. The river is 62 miles long and no more than 20 meters wide in any section, and it’s widely believed to be the most beautiful river worldwide. It’s a unique option to make your marriage proposal particularly special. 5. Lagh de Calvaresc, Switzerland. Lagh de Calvaresc in Switzerland is another great location if you want to propose. The heart-shaped lake is 2,214 meters above sea level. It can be the perfect backdrop to pop the question. Go on a hike — it’ll take several hours to complete — and end it at Lagh de Calvaresc where you can get down on one knee and ask your significant other if they’ll marry you. These are five options to propose to your significant other overseas. Whether you choose one of these destinations or go elsewhere, you can make one of the best days in both of your lives more memorable for all the right reasons.",
