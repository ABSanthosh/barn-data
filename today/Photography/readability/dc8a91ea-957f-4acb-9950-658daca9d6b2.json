The circular fisheye lens is a 6.5mm f/2 lens for APS-C mounts with a 192 degree ultra wide angle spherical view. Image via AstrHori The lens is fully manual and has a solid metal body that is of high quality. It comes with a minimum focusing distance of 0.2m which means creative images can be captured by getting closer to the subjects. The barrel distortion gives the resulting images an other-worldly feel. With this effect, the lens can be used to capture creative looking portraits, landscapes and other architectural images. Moreover, the f/2 aperture helps to gather a lot of light, making this lens a great option for also capturing stunning night sky images. The lens is lightweight and is compatible with a few drone models. This makes it a versatile lens for some unique aerial shots. Here are some of the most important features of this lens: 6.5mm f/2, circular fisheye lens for APS-C cameras Aperture range – F2 to F22 192 degrees angle of view Compatible with drones 0.2m minimum focus distance Weight – 268g Low dispersion, high refractive lens Manual focus 6 optical elements in 5 groups 9 blade aperture Does not support filters If you would like to read more about this lens, check out the link here. The lens is available to pre-order and costs $129.00, which is an affordable one for photographers who would like to get their hands on an ultra-wide lens.
