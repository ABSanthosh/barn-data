  "text": "7 October 2024 : Monday Oct 2024 : Monday See More Photos of:  Travel I put together a selection of family photos to celebrate the life of Tina. I love her so much. Last week I put a post on my two FB profiles about her passing and they received so many wonderful comments. Thank you all. I can’t respond to all of them, but I certainly read all of them and felt the love for the rest of the family, especially the kids. You know, frankly, I used to think the ‘Thoughts and Prayers’ comments were kind of silly, especially back in my atheist days. But after everything I’ve experienced over the past few years, I see things differently now. So, please, yes, send your love to our amazing kids Ethan, Isabella, and Scarlett, and also to Tina’s family with Bessie, Taylor, Michelle, and her entire extended family. Sending love energy really works… and it’s the most powerful energy in the world. And I’m sending love back ‘atcha!",
