  "description": "Itâ€™s a live stream where you can ask members of the Lightroom team directly, and itâ€™s all hosted by the one and only Terry White. Itâ€™s at 1:00 PM EDT (10:00 am PDT), and this is a fantastic opportunity to ask them your Lightroom questions. Iâ€™ve embedded the stream right here (below). This is going to be a great steam â€“Â donâ€™t miss it. ðŸ™‚ My Paris Travel Photography Workshop is Sold Out I always encourage photographers to sign up for my early notice workshop email, so they have a chance to buy a ticket before I announce it to the public, because in most cases, itâ€™s sold out before the public announcement. Thatâ€™s the case once again with my upcoming Paris Workshop â€“Â itâ€™s already sold out. So, if you think you might want to join me on one of these workshops in the future, sign up for my early notice list at scottkelbyworkshops.com, scroll to the bottom of the page, and youâ€™ll see where to sign up. Have a great weekend, everybody! The post Live Q\u0026A With Adobeâ€™s Lightroom Team Today at 1:00 PM EDT appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",
