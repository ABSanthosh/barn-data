We could hear the EOS M faithful cheering at the direction we’re going to see in the APS-C lineup.We have reported about the existence of an EOS R50V and wondered aloud if this model name was in fact the EOS RV. If we go by what a terrific source is telling us, they may in fact be two different cameras.What Could A Canon EOS R50 V Be?We’re told that it will inherit the same 24.2mp sensor that is currently in the EOS R50 and EOS R10. The body ergonomics would be very similar to what we have seen with the EOS RV. That means no flash or EVF.It wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibilities for Canon to hit two different price points with these new and smaller RF mount APS-C cameras. You need volume sales, and you need enthusiasts on board if you’re going to make the APS-C lineup compelling for everyone.Canon EOS R50We think the Canon EOS RV may have active cooling, just by the large grill on the top of the camera that is not the microphone. Active cooling could be a feature that the lower priced camera would go without. IBIS could be another thing that would differentiate the pair of rumored cameras.We don’t have definitive specifications on either camera currently, we’re just giving you some possibilities.One thing that makes us happy? It’s not called an EOS R100V.Canon EOS RV With The 32.5mp Sensor?One thing that could segment the cameras is the image sensor. I suggested, but am mostly hoping that Canon would bring the EOS R7 sensor to more cameras, it’s very good and would be most welcomed for both photographers and videographers.We’re hoping we get a clearer picture soon.We have talked to a couple of other sources, and they’ve nodded their heads about APS-C cameras to compete with the Sony ZV line, but they haven’t been able or willing to tell us when to expect these cameras to be announced.Update: AI Generated Image of the EOS R50 VJust like the Canon PowerShot V1, we have been provided an AI mockup of what the EOS R50 V will look like. If you remember the AI images sent to use to represent the PowerShot V1, they were probably as close as they could have been.AI Generated Mockup Of The Rumored Canon EOS R50 VIf we go by this mock-up compared to the leaked image of the EOS RV. It looks even smaller. That is a desire for a lot of buyers out there. As long as there are lenses to match these new cameras, Canon will have a couple of winners on their hands.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
