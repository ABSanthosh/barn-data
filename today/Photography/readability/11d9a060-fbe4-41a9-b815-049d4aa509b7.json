The camera comes with a 24.5 megapixel full-frame sensor and the EXPEED 7 image processing engine which the Z8 and Z9 models have. Image via Nikon The Z5 II camera comes with a new autofocus mode, the AF-A mode that allows automatic switching between single and continuous autofocus modes depending on changes detected in the scene. This can be useful especially for beginners who are still learning or confused on which focus modes to use when in the field. Another interesting feature is the focus point VR which helps with stabilization in the areas covered by the autofocus point/s. This camera also has a back-illuminated CMOS sensor that reduces noise and blur, making it a camera with great low light performance and hence performs well in dark or dimly lit situations. The camera is powered by AI technology that offers subject detection which helps with accurate and high speed focusing. It also has a bird detection mode besides others, that can be helpful for photographers interested in photographing birds and other subjects. Besides the new and useful features for still photography, the Z5 II offers new 12 bit N-Raw video format for videos. This makes it a great camera for anyone who is interested in capturing videos besides still photos. Some of the most important features of the Nikon Z5 II are: 24.5 MP full-frame CMOS sensor EXPEED 7 image processor Subject detection Autofocus sensitivity up to -10 EV Focus point VR High burst mode N-RAW and N-Log formats for videos Pre-release capture 31 presets for picture control 3.2 inch vari-angle LCD screen More details about this camera can be found here. The camera is available for pre-order with or without the kit. We have more news for you to read if you are interested at this link here.",
