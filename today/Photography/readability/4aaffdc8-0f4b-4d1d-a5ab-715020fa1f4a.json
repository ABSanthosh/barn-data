The SX740 HS covered a range of 24-960mm (35mm equivalent). You can shoot 4K video and timelapse as well has having 10fps max frame rate for stills. This is a really well thought out camera from Canon. PowerShot SX740 HS Discontinued Canon has now officially discontinued the camera, and whatever stock is out there will be the last of it. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, Canon suspended orders back in March ahead of the new PowerShot V1, which is a sign of a new line of PowerShot cameras. Hopefully some of the inflated pricing for older Canon Power Shot cameras won’t continue, and these cameras become more affordable in more markets. 20.3MP CMOS Sensor DIGIC 8 Image Processor 24-960mm (35mm Equivalent) 40x Optical Zoom with OIS 3″ Tilting LCD Display ISO 100-3200 (Extended) 4K Video and 4K Time-Lapse Recording Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Connectivity 10-fps Continuous Shooting Few things will be too far away for the black PowerShot SX740 HS Digital Camera from Canon. Boasting a 20.3MP CMOS sensor and 40x optical zoom, this all-in-one point-and-shoot can capture things near and far. Helping the far end of its 24-960mm zoom range (35mm equivalent) is optical image stabilization which keeps your photos sharp and in focus. Zoom Framing Assistant makes it easier to track subjects at the long end of the focal length by quickly zooming out and then back in at the press of a button once you’ve located your subject. Canon’s DIGIC 8 Image Processor helps the camera keep up with your shooting, allowing for 10-fps continuous shooting with AF lock on. Is this still a good camera to buy? The Canon PowerShot SX740 HS will be a capable camera for years to come if you’re looking for a longer zoom compact without a protruding lens when the camera is off. While it won’t keep up with the latest and greatest as far as autofocus and high ISO performance goes, but that’s not really going to affect anyone’s enjoyment of the camera. Is There a Replacement Coming? Yes, there will be a new “superzoom” PowerShot camera coming later this year, we do not know if it will be part of the Z series, or a new line of G series cameras. We don’t think we’ll see “SX” again. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works. Go to discussion...
