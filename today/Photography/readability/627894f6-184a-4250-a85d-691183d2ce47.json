  "text": "What is AIGC? AI-generated content (AIGC) refers to images created entirely by artificial intelligence rather than captured by a camera. These images are produced using algorithms that synthesize visuals based on existing data, often mimicking styles or subjects found in real photography. In recent years, AI tools have made it possible to generate images at scale, leading to a surge of AI content across creative platforms. While these advancements are impressive, they raise significant concerns—especially regarding copyright, Licensing, and the authenticity of creative work. AI-generated images do not qualify for copyright protection, making them unsuitable for Licensing. More importantly, they do not align with what 500px stands for. 500px’s Stance on AIGC Photography has always been the foundation of 500px. Since the beginning, we have been a platform where amateur or professional photographers can showcase their talent, tell their stories, and connect with a like-minded community. As AI-generated content gains traction in the art world, we want to be clear: 500px is, and always will be, a platform for real photography. Our community is built for those who get behind the camera to capture life’s moments—not for AI-generated images that bypass the creative process of photography. While AI-powered tools can assist in editing and refining photos, every image on 500px must be rooted in real photography. AI-generated content is not permitted on 500px, including in Licensing, Quests, or uploaded to your Profile. Our commitment is to preserve the authenticity of the work shared here, ensuring that what you see reflects a photographer’s skill, creativity, and vision. When Is AI Acceptable in Photography? AI-powered tools can be useful for minor refinements, like removing small blemishes or distractions, but edits should remain subtle—affecting less than 10% of the final image. Overediting or altering core aspects of a subject, such as a model’s expression or natural features, undermines the authenticity that defines real photography. The rise of AI-generated imagery has sparked discussions about the value and authenticity of art. While AI can create visually striking images, it cannot replicate the depth of human experience, intention, and artistic vision. Photography is more than just capturing an image—it’s about emotion, perspective, and storytelling. AI, while powerful, struggles with true abstraction and the nuanced understanding of human experiences. It lacks the spontaneity, imperfection, and raw authenticity that make photography deeply meaningful. Enforcing Our Standards \u0026 Community Action As technology evolves, detecting AI-generated content is becoming more complex, but we remain proactive in safeguarding the integrity of 500px. We are continuously enhancing our detection methods and enforcing strict measures to prevent AI-generated content from being shared on the platform. 500px has a zero-tolerance policy for AI-generated content in Licensing and Quests. Submitting AIGC to these areas will result in a permanent ban from the 500px community. We also rely on our community to help maintain these standards. If you come across AI-generated content, report it, and our team will review it to ensure 500px remains a space for real photography. To learn how to report a photo or profile, please check out our FAQ. At 500px, photography is more than just an image—it’s a captured moment, a true story told through the art of seeing. We remain committed to protecting our community and keeping 500px a home for real photography.",
