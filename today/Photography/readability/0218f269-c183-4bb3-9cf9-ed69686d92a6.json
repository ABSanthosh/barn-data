Sure, printing photos and making a photo album can be a nice gift, but there are other options that are far more impressive.   1. A custom canvas print   It’s always nice to have photos of your loved ones on the wall, but traditional frames are overrated. You can add a nice touch of class to someone’s home by gifting them a custom canvas photo print. They’re easy to have made and come in a variety of sizes and options.   While there are plenty of businesses who offer standard canvas prints, make sure you get the best aesthetics. For example, The Canvas Factory offers canvas photo prints that wrap around the edges, which is something not all companies offer.   Having your design cover the edges makes all the difference.   2. A handmade scrapbook   If you’re into being super creative, making a custom scrapbook with photos of your loved ones is a great idea. Scrapbooks are a great way to display your creative side and make a finished product that looks amazing. Some people even use scrapbooks for coffee table books.   3. A custom photo collage mug   When your loved one wakes up in the morning and grabs a mug to make coffee, they’ll have a big smile on their face when they reach for a photo mug. Photo collage mugs are popular because people like seeing the faces of their loved ones while they enjoy a cup of coffee, tea, or anything else. It can even help them get through their day at work.   You can put as many photos on a mug as you like, but most design platforms require you to upload either one large image or two images that can be placed on either side of the mug. If you want to make a full collage that spans across the entire mug, you’ll need to prepare your image file in a graphics program like Photoshop or Canva.   4. A creative photo storybook   Both kids and adults enjoy reading stories, but it’s more fun when the stories are personal. There are companies out there that make illustrated storybooks in which you can use the photos of your choice for the characters’ heads. With a variety of story topics and illustration styles, including comic book-style art, there’s an option for everyone.   Younger kids get a kick out of seeing themselves as the hero in an adventure story, but adults also get a good laugh from seeing themselves and their family members star in stories with funny plots.   5. Photo collage home décor   There are endless types of home décor you can have personalized with your favorite photos. There are tapestries, metal signs, throw blankets, and even pillows and pillowcases. Many of these items are all over print, which means the print extends to all the edges of the fabric.   Many people get custom throw pillows made with goofy photos of their loved ones to make them laugh, and they end up being the recipient’s favorite pillow. Another good idea is to put a picture of someone’s pet on a pillow or throw blanket.   6. A photo collage tumbler   In addition to traditional mugs, you can also put a photo collage on a tumbler. There are technically several types of drinking vessels that fall under that category, but in this case, it’s a reference to the tall plastic insulated mugs people buy from coffee shops, like Starbucks.   These types of tumblers are easy to customize online and you can also do it at home with sublimation. Once you have the right machine and supplies, with a little practice, you can make just about anything with sublimation.   7. A photo collage blanket   Throw blankets are nice for the couch, but if you want to really impress your gift recipient, go all out and make them a full-size photo collage blanket. This type of gift will make people feel happy whenever they go to bed for the night or simply walk into their bedroom.   You can get custom photo blankets made with all over print, which means the photos will be printed to all the edges of the blanket. For all over print items, they’re usually printed first and then sewn together. The only downside is they’re almost always made with a polyester blend, which may not be everyone’s preference.   Personalized photo gifts will be cherished   If you’re looking for a gift that will make someone smile for years to come, get them a personalized photo gift so they can see the faces of people and pets who make them happy.",
