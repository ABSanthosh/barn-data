  "text": "It seems that someone snagged a photo of a future Canon camera, with the identifier of Canon EOS RV. It’s a compact camera looking to have a similar frame to the PowerShot V1.The Canon EOS RV will be one of three new RF mount camera segments being added to the Canon lineup in 2025.Let’s Break it DownLooking at the picture, it seems as if it is going to come with its own lens with power zoom (the T-W on the side of the lens gives that away), and there’s a lever on the shutter button that I would presume is the zoom lever.Other clues that we can guess from the image are slim, there is an articulating screen hinge visible, standard mode dial and one another top control dial. It’s difficult to guess at the button on the bottom corner on the front of the camera, but it seems to say record (“REC”).What is the Lens on the Canon EOS-RV?The lens is a bit of an unknown, as the focal length is a bit blurred. We do have a good idea it’s a power zoom as we mentioned prior, but the rest is certainly hard to tell for certain.Craig and I were batting around that perhaps it’s the same focal range as the PowerShot V1. That would make alot of sense at least in my lizard brain. Make sure you check out our PowerShot V1 Preview.The PowerShot has a 16-50mm equivalent lens, which in APS-C terms would be around 10-31mm. It’s really difficult to tell, but it kind of looks like it could be 11-30mm on the image, which would be that very close to matching up with the PowerShot V1.It’s also quite a large lens in terms of diameter when you consider that most of Canon’s RF-S lenses are smaller in diameter than the RF mount’s diameter and flare out to fit the full size of the mount.Canon RF-S 10-18mm f/4.5-6.3 IS STMThis could be to support the electronic power zoom features of the lens, or simply to look good.The Ergonomics Look Quite DifferentThis is quite a radical ergonomic change from normal Canon EOS, so it’s an interesting divergence from what would be the norm for Canon. The shutter button has a zoom lever attached, there doesn’t seem to be a mFn or a record button on the top where Canon has been placing it for.. well, almost an eternity.I can’t even tell you where the power button is, unless it’s around the mode dial like it was on the PowerShot V1, making it – yet another position for the power button. I swear Canon has this big spinning wheel that has various power button positions and they just throw darts at the board blindfolded.Top view of the PowerShot V1If we look at the PowerShot V1, we can see going by the hot shoe size and comparing it to the image, that it’s similar in depth, not even a little deeper than the PowerShot V1 body.There also seems to be a larger grill next to the hot shoe and the body itself seems very chunky, so I suspect there is some form of active cooling in the camera which probably leads itself well to the “V” designation.Similar to the Sony ZV-E10 Series – It’s Main CompetitorThis camera seems to share alot of similarities, and probably more similarities with the Sony ZV-E10 series of cameras than it does Canon’s own cameras.Sony ZV-E10 IIAs you can see the Sony also supports power zooming via a button around the shutter button, and mode and control dial arrangement grouped up on the right hand size.The Sony does seem to be more slim and not as deep as the Canon EOS RV, but at the same time, the Sony could be more limited in video recording times.We knew that there was a video orientated camera that was perhaps identified as a EOS R50 V or Canon EOS RC coming this year. This could very well be the camera that we were told about.Source: Mirrorless RumorsWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
