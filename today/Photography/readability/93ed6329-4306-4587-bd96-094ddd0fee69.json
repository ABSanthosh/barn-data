Canon has continued to sell the PowerShot G7 X Mark III and PowerShot SX740 HS, likely to Canon’s surprise.The PowerShot V1 is getting the standard grievances about products like this. No EVF, no built-in flash, and those sorts of things. Which is generally people that don’t understand who the target is for a product or technical limitations and compromises to meet a certain price point and balance that with capabilities.Canon PowerShot V1We have been told by a source that is very accurate, that Canon DOES have plans to continue the “G” series of PowerShot cameras, however they are likely going to be addressed after a couple of PowerShot V series cameras.We’re told that Canon does have long-term plans to make another “line” of PowerShot cameras not targeted to video creators. That’s not to say the PowerShot V1 won’t be a great stills camera, but photographers don’t really need active cooling and tend to want faster lenses.PowerShot G15 (2012)A New Line of G-Series CamerasWe’d like to stress that a new “G” series line isn’t imminent. When we hear from this person, the product has been 6-18 months down the road.We were told that there will be a PowerShot “G” series camera with an EVF and one without, probably a lineage continuation of the popular PowerShot G7 X Mark III.We were also told that naming conventions would change and that “Mark” wouldn’t be used in the next round of PowerShot G cameras.Restarting naming is probably a smart way to go for the next generation of shooters. We know what “Mark” means, but younger people may wonder why the camera is called “Mark”?It sounds like photographers are going to be taken care of down the road. As we’ve seen from Canon over the last year or two, the hybrid and video shooter has been their target, because that’s where they think the volume lies. They’re probably right.SummaryWe just wanted to stress again. We do not believe a new “G” series camera is coming in the near term.We also think it’s possible that Canon does away with “G” and picks another letter for a new series of cameras. The “G Series” doesn’t mean much to the coming generations of customers.We think any further information about new “G” series cameras will be slow to come, as we do not think they’re coming in the near future.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
