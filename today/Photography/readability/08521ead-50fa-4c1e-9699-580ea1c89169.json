  "text": "B\u0026H Photo announced that its Bild Expo, which feels to many like the spiritual successor to the now-defunct Photo Plus, is coming back to the Javits Center in New York City on June 17 and 18, 2025. After Photo Plus collapsed and its follow-up, Create NYC, also failed, it did not look like the future of photography-focused events in New York City would return. B\u0026H has, however, proven the opposite, with the Bild Expo as both manufacturers and attendees seem to resonate with what is being offered. Its list of sponsors is a whos-who of the biggest names in the industry. Bild Expo first launched in September 2023 and promised to follow up with another in 2025. There, over 160 brands and 70 speakers were presented to the wholly free in-person event. ‚ÄúBild Expo is more than just an event‚Äîit‚Äôs an energetic gathering of like-minded creatives from all corners of the content world,‚Äù Jeff Gerstel, Chief Marketing Officer at B\u0026H Photo, says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre beyond excited to create this special opportunity for content creators, photographers, videographers, podcasters, and filmmakers at all levels to learn, connect, and be inspired by the leaders of our industry and the latest gear.‚Äù Bild‚Äôs organizers have made good on the promise of a show this year and it is growing even larger. B\u0026H says that Bild will feature more than 100 speakers and hands-on demonstrations as well as exclusive deals from more than 250 brands ‚Äî that‚Äôs a sizeable increase from the last event. The organizer says that the show is meant to be more than a showcase of the latest gear, but also be an ‚Äúimmersive experience‚Äù designed to ‚Äúexpand creative horizons.‚Äù The show isn‚Äôt just for photographers either, as B\u0026H says Bild will also appeal to filmmakers, podcasters, and general content creators, too. The show doesn‚Äôt stay inside the walls of the Javits Center, either. B\u0026H promises after-hours events off-site and the event‚Äôs website promises photo walks. ‚ÄúThis year‚Äôs event will be bigger and better, featuring more speakers, more brand exhibitors, and more opportunities for learning and hands-on experiences. Whether you‚Äôre a content creator, photographer, or filmmaker, Bild Expo 2025 will be the can‚Äôt miss event of the year‚Äîand it‚Äôs absolutely free to attend! Bild will take place at New York City‚Äôs Javits Center on June 17-18, 2025,‚Äù B\u0026H says. Registration for the event can be found on the Bild Expo website.
