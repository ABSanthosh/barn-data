Inspired by the legendary ZEISS Otus family, these new lenses bring ZEISS’ renowned optical excellence to mirrorless cameras: Sony1 E, Canon2 RF- and Nikon3 Z-Mount.Preorder OptionsB\u0026H Photo: ZEISS Otus ML 50mm f/1.4 Lens (Canon RF) $2499B\u0026H Photo: ZEISS Otus ML 85mm f/1.4 Lens (Canon RF) $2999Continuing the Legacy of the First Otus GenerationThe Otus ML lenses are engineered to provide exceptional optical performance, revealing details that may not be discernible to the naked eye. These lenses embody the well-regarded ZEISS Look, characterized by sharpness, accurate color reproduction, and a three-dimensional quality.The apochromatic lens design ensures excellent color fidelity while minimizing chromatic aberrations. Additionally, the aspherical design contributes to virtually distortion-free images, enhancing overall image quality. The ZEISS T* anti-reflective coating further reduces reflections and flare, improving clarity and color accuracy.From a mechanical standpoint, the Otus ML lenses offer precise manual focus, which enhance the creative and storytelling process. The lenses feature a smooth metal focus ring with a precision helicoid drive, facilitating accurate focusing.Manual aperture control, equipped with a de-click function for video, allows for seamless adjustments, which can be advantageous in various shooting scenarios.Manual focusing is more than a method — it’s a way for photographers to connect deeply with their creative power and craftsman-ship, enabling both unparalleled control and artistic freedom. It allows for precise focusing on the center of the image, the story, and emphasizes the exact details that bring the visual idea to life.  Petra Visuri, Category Manager ZEISS PhotographyZEISS Otus ML 1.4/50We are pleased to announce the introduction of the Otus ML lens to the community of photographers.
