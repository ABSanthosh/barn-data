  "description": "The Good News: On Monday, I wrote a post about my favorite underrated feature from Adobe June Lightroom update, which was the fact that they updated the workflow for the Noise Reduction feature, and that: (1) They moved it to a more discoverable place (the Detail Panel), and more importantly: (2) It no longer makes a 2nd copy of your Raw image and applies the noise reduction to this new DNG image. Now it doesn’t make a 2nd copy, and it applies it to your raw image just like any other edit. I love it! The Potentially Bad News: Depending on your workflow, this could be bad news, and here’s why: Using the old method, you could select more than one image at a time, apply noise reduction, and the whole process happened in the background, and you were free to keep editing other images. The new version broke that workflow, so if you select multiple photos and apply noise reduction, it no longer processes your images in the background. Instead, a progress bar comes up, and while it’s processing the images (which, as you know, can be a few minutes to a whole bunch of minutes, depending on the speed of your computer and how many images you’re applying it to), you can’t do anything else until it’s done. If you didn’t regularly batch process images for noise reduction, then this probably isn’t an issue at all (I never did more than the one image I was working on at the time, so it never was for me), but for some folks, this could really be an issue, and I totally get it. Some Potentially Good News: Adobe is very aware of the issue, and I imagine they are working on some sort of solution. I’ll be keeping an eye on the issue, and if I hear anything I can share, I’ll let you know, but in the meantime, I thought it was important to let you know about the issue, and that Adobe know about it. Important disclaimer: Anytime I mention Adobe and Lightroom in the same sentence, it triggers a small, special group of photographers who, after 12 long years, are still somehow holding out for Adobe to sell Lightroom and Photoshop as a perpetual license. If you’re one of those people, I had a frank discussion with folks feeling this way on this week’s episode of “The Grid.” You can watch it below (rather than leaving the same predictable comment as always). It starts at the 5:57 minute mark. If you’re into Travel Photography, there’s an online conference coming next month for you! Check out the official trailer below. It’s 2-days, 2-tracks, tons of great classes on everything from the photography to the post processing, and if you use On1’s plugins, you absolutely don’t want to miss this one (plus, you get the entire conference archieved to stream on-demand for an entire year). You can get your ticket (and save $100) right now at kelbyonelive.com Thanks, everybody.
