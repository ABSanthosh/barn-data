  "text": "I love the 75mm focal length. In fact, anything around 70mm to 90mm is more like a normal lens for me than a 50mm. And if the lens has a fast aperture, I’m even more enamored. I’ve reviewed Thypoch lenses before and found them to be beautifully machined and full of character, but that doesn’t always mean they are good optically. I also hate the locking mechanism on the manual focus ring with a passion. These are just a couple of reasons why I was so pleasantly surprised by the new $850 Simera 75mm f/1.4. I hate this locking switch and am thrilled about its absence on the Simera 75mm. All the machining work is expertly done. The manual focus ring and aperture ring have engraved font and turn very smoothly. Thypoch Simera 75mm f/1.4 Review: How It Feels Make no mistake: the Simera 75mm is beautifully machined, but Thypoch has done away with the frustrating locking mechanism on the focus ring. I still love the clever visual depth of field gauge, and the aperture ring can be set for smooth or click-stop functionality. At just over thirteen ounces (372 grams), the 75mm has some heft to it, which only serves to make the lens feel solidly well built. The Simera 75mm f/1.4 takes 58mm filters, and there are 16 aperture blades inside the lens, which should make for some smooth-looking bokeh. I had a black one for testing, but they also come in a handsome chrome finish. The Simera 75mm is somewhat bulky-looking but quite practical in the hand. The front element takes 58mm filters. The depth of field scale can be seen here as a series of dots. The Simera 75mm is currently only offered in Leica M mount, and for my testing, I adapted it to a Sony a7RV so I could really evaluate image quality. However, I also shot some black and white film on an M mount Voigtlander Bessa R2a so that I could evaluate other ways that the lens would commonly be used. It’s important to remember that these lenses do not have autofocus or any sort of electrical communication with digital bodies, so there is no EXIF data, and any image stabilization in the body has to be set manually. There is a switch to declick the aperture if desired. The Thypoch lenses are designed to fit on Leica M mount cameras. Thypoch Simera 75mm f/1.4 Review: How it Shoots It seems that many of the manual focus lenses trade image quality and optical corrections under the guise of being rich with character. You’re supposed to love the flaws and embrace the issues, but I don’t always want that present in my images. So, how did the Simera 75mm do? Well, flare is the first thing I tested, and the Simera does a pretty good job when shooting wide-open and using the hood. There is some loss of contrast, but the lens doesn’t have too many issues. Stop the lens down a bit, and you will start to get some very obvious ghosting and colorful reflections. If the hood is left off, you can also get some pretty heavy ghosting when the light source is just outside the frame. Flare is handled quite well but some ghosting will show. LoCA is obvious on both our test and the sharpness charts, too. I shot in Las Vegas for some of the digital tests and the lens performed great. LoCA, or longitudinal chromatic aberration, is very difficult to get rid of in the editing phase, and it never looks nice. Unfortunately, the Simera 75mm does suffer from some visible LoCA, especially at f/1.4. Shooting black and white images is one fix, but if you are shooting color and shooting with shallow depth of field, LoCA will rear its ugly head. However, bokeh is quite beautiful on the Simera. There is a pleasant cat’s eye effect to the specular highlights at f/1.4, which can give you a nice swirly look to your images. Stopping the lens down, we see the benefit of that very round-shaped aperture: bokeh is quite smooth with no onion ring issues. The backgrounds can look slightly harsh, but I would say that overall, the bokeh is smooth and pleasant. Bokeh is pleasant with a slight harshness to the backgrounds, but clean-looking highlights overall. Background can look strong and slightly harsh but I still like the shallow depth of field possible on this lens. I was also really pleased with the sharpness at f/1.4. There is excellent detail retained in the center of the image, and it exhibits decent contrast, too. Stopping the lens down just makes it better, but I would happily shoot this lens at wider apertures all day long. The corner sharpness suffers a bit, although this is of minor concern on portrait-range lenses like the 75mm focal length. Again, stopping down the lens helps here, but the extreme corners never become excellent by any stretch. Sharpness is good at f/1.4 and boasts good contrast in the center of the image. Corners can get a little smooshed on the Thypoch lens. You can still get punchy contrast out of the Thypoch lens by simply stopping down the aperture. Thypoch Simera 75mm f/1.4 Review: M-Mount for the Masses For $850, I feel like the Simera 75mm represents decent value. M-mount lenses from Voigtlander and especially Leica tend to be pricey, and the Simera 75mm f/1.4 certainly comes in below as a viable alternative. Most importantly, the image quality is good where a 75mm f/1.4 needs it to be. The lens is sharp and the bokeh is high-quality, so it’s easy to forgive the other flaws. I wouldn’t often reach for this lens on a digital body with an adapter, but I would absolutely use it for analog pursuits or as an affordable portrait and street photography lens on a digital Leica M camera. The Simera 75mm f/1.4 has an almost dreamy look at f/1.4, which is particularly nice on 35mm film and can always deliver more mainstream results when stopped down slightly. A 75mm lens has a look that I love and a tighter frame than 50mm lenses. The architecture of train stations and civic buildings is wonderful to capture in Prague. The Simera 75mm has a nice tonality which renders beautifully on film. Prague is a wonderful city for street photography moments. Are There Alternatives? If you are going to adapt it to a digital mirrorless camera, the autofocusing 85mm lenses that are available are often a better buy. For example, the $1100 Sigma Art 85mm f/1.4 is slightly more money but infinitely cleaner optically. If you are sticking to native M mount lenses, the Voigtlander Nokton 75mm f/1.5 is a good option and is usually found around the same $850 mark. It boasts similar performance and would be an excellent option, too. Jordan rocking the Simera on the Sony A7RV. Street photography and portraits are this lens’ forte. Should You Buy It? Yes. With the Thypoch Simera 75mm f/1.4, you get some “character” but also a solid performance out of this plucky little lens.",

There is some loss of contrast, but the lens doesn’t have too many issues. Stop the lens down a bit, and you will start to get some very obvious ghosting and colorful reflections. If the hood is left off, you can also get some pretty heavy ghosting when the light source is just outside the frame. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cfigure id=\"attachment_793969\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-793969\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09877-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09877-800x533.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09877-320x213.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-793969\"\u003eFlare is handled quite well but some ghosting will show.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n \u003cfigure id=\"attachment_793968\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-793968\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC04528-75mm-f1.4-Loca-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC04528-75mm-f1.4-Loca-800x533.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC04528-75mm-f1.4-Loca-320x213.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-793968\"\u003eLoCA is obvious on both our test and the sharpness charts, too.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e \u003cfigure id=\"attachment_793962\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-793962\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09805-533x800.jpg\" alt=\"A nighttime view of the Palazzo hotel tower in Las Vegas, illuminated with gold lighting, with a palm tree in the foreground.\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09805-533x800.jpg 533w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09805-213x320.jpg 213w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09805-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09805-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09805-scaled.jpg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-793962\"\u003eI shot in Las Vegas for some of the digital tests and the lens performed great.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e \u003cp\u003eLoCA, or longitudinal chromatic aberration, is very difficult to get rid of in the editing phase, and it never looks nice. Unfortunately, the Simera 75mm does suffer from some visible LoCA, especially at f/1.4. Shooting black and white images is one fix, but if you are shooting color and shooting with shallow depth of field, LoCA will rear its ugly head. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHowever, bokeh is quite beautiful on the Simera. There is a pleasant cat’s eye effect to the specular highlights at f/1.4, which can give you a nice swirly look to your images. Stopping the lens down, we see the benefit of that very round-shaped aperture: bokeh is quite smooth with no onion ring issues. The backgrounds can look slightly harsh, but I would say that overall, the bokeh is smooth and pleasant. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cfigure id=\"attachment_793961\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-793961\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09802-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"A large white sphere with colorful polka dots and a cartoon-style face with a black X for one eye and a curved smile, set against a background of twinkling yellow lights and blurred trees.\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09802-800x533.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09802-320x213.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09802-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09802-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09802-450x300.jpg 450w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09802-300x200.jpg 300w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09802-120x80.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-793961\"\u003eBokeh is pleasant with a slight harshness to the backgrounds, but clean-looking highlights overall.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e \u003cfigure id=\"attachment_793966\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-793966\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09869-533x800.jpg\" alt=\"A cluster of vibrant yellow flowers is in focus in the foreground, with a blurred background featuring a pond and lush green plants.\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09869-533x800.jpg 533w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09869-213x320.jpg 213w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09869-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09869-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09869-scaled.jpg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-793966\"\u003eBackground can look strong and slightly harsh but I still like the shallow depth of field possible on this lens.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/15a-800x530.jpg\" alt=\"Black and white photo of a crosswalk with cracked lines and a round metal object on the pavement.

M-mount lenses from Voigtlander and especially Leica tend to be pricey, and the Simera 75mm f/1.4 certainly comes in below as a viable alternative. Most importantly, the image quality is good where a 75mm f/1.4 needs it to be. The lens is sharp and the bokeh is high-quality, so it’s easy to forgive the other flaws. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI wouldn’t often reach for this lens on a digital body with an adapter, but I would absolutely use it for analog pursuits or as an affordable portrait and street photography lens on a digital Leica M camera. The Simera 75mm f/1.4 has an almost dreamy look at f/1.4, which is particularly nice on 35mm film and can always deliver more mainstream results when stopped down slightly. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09844-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"A woman wearing sunglasses and a black leather jacket sits in the driver\u0026#39;s seat of a silver car, looking out the open window with a serious expression.\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09844-800x533.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09844-320x213.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09844-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09844-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09844-450x300.jpg 450w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09844-300x200.jpg 300w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09844-120x80.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cfigure id=\"attachment_793963\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-793963\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09824-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"A man sits at a bar counter talking to a bartender in a cozy pub with brick walls, neon signs, trophies, beer taps, and colorful decor.

It boasts similar performance and would be an excellent option, too.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ccenter\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e \u003c/center\u003e \u003cfigure id=\"attachment_793954\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-793954\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/Thypoch-75mm-On-Sony-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"A person in a black shirt holds a camera up to their face, preparing to take a photo in a studio with a large softbox light and a color calibration chart in the background.\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/Thypoch-75mm-On-Sony-800x450.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/Thypoch-75mm-On-Sony-320x180.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/Thypoch-75mm-On-Sony-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/Thypoch-75mm-On-Sony-2048x1152.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-793954\"\u003eJordan rocking the Simera on the Sony A7RV.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n \u003cfigure id=\"attachment_793967\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-793967\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09871-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"A man in casual clothes stands on an escalator next to lush indoor plants and colorful flowers, holding a phone and a shopping bag in a bright, elegant mall setting.\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09871-800x533.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09871-320x213.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09871-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09871-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09871-450x300.jpg 450w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09871-300x200.jpg 300w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/DSC09871-120x80.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-793967\"\u003eStreet photography and portraits are this lens’ forte.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e \u003ch3\u003eShould You Buy It?\u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp\u003eYes.
