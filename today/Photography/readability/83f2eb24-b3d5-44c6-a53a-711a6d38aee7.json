At the time, this was before the now likely trinity of f/2.8’s IS STMs were forming, so I can be forgiven (maybe) for that judgment call.After some looking around because I did remember the RF 16-28mm f/2.8 IS STM appearing sometime this year, we have discovered a few things, there does seem to be very much the possibility that there’s a 3 to 6-month lag between Canon’s patent applications being published and then Canon announcing a lens. So when I do write up “yet-another-patent-application-on-a-rf-lens” just remember back to this conversation. Canon, it seems, still has the urge to surprise us.Secondly, Canon is going outside the box in terms of its designs and what it thinks is a product, much more so than in the days of DSLRs. When you think of the RF 16-28mm and the RF 24-50mm lenses, these are designs that Canon wouldn’t have considered in the EF days.Apparently, Canon likes doing odd ball lenses now that we never considered before, like this one.As someone who had to dump their full frame kit when they started to travel around Asia, I can get behind Canon looking at making a more travel-friendly kit for full frame, even if it is on the pricey side. Considering that a significant amount of money gets spent on full frame mirrorless in Asia, and most of Asia is very limited to onboard carry-on, taking this into account with your biggest market – is something to be expected.Now, back to this patent application (2024-101615), we see that the first embodiment is the Canon RF 16-28mm F2.8 IS STM (naturally, it is, just to rub it in, Canon). From embodiment 1, here’s the optical formula and how the elements move as the lens zooms.And just to confirm that this is the Canon RF 16-28, here’s the published element layout.But this allows us to garner more information than what the MTFs tell us, primarily how much of this performance is due to digital correction.WideMiddleTelephotoFocal length15.48824.11427.160F-number2.9002.9002.900Half angle (°)54.53242.07538.744Image Height17.550 20.100 20.460Lens Length140.161129.781129.964  Back Focus13.27013.27013.270I have bolded the image height because that tells us how much the image circle needs to be digitally expanded. For full frame the image height needs to be at least 21.64mm. In this case, image height is the radius of the image circle. Don’t ask me why they call it “height”.As you can see, there is a digital correction throughout the zoom range to fill the entire 35mm full-frame sensor. This is evident by the fact that in the three described focal lengths, the image height does not meet or exceed 21.64mm.While 17.55mm is pretty excessive, the amount of digital correction needed by 24 and 28mm, as shown in the table, is fairly minimal. Now is this bad? Some will point out that it’s an expensive lens to rely on digital correction, while this is true, it’s also a very compact and lightweight lens.Preorder OptionsB\u0026H Photo: Canon RF 16-28mm f/2.8 IS STM $1149Midwest Photo: Canon RF 16-28mm f/2.8 IS STM $1149Adorama: Canon RF 16-28mm f/2.8 IS STM $1149Canon USA: Canon RF 16-28mm f/2.8 IS STM $1149Foto Koch: Canon RF 16-28mm f/2.8 IS STM €1309Wex Photo: Canon RF 16-28mm f/2.8 IS STM £1249Source: Patent Application 2024-101615When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
