Photo by Laura Heimann And to be sure, COVID-19 and the global pandemic certainly put the kibosh on the ailing convention industry. But for those of us who like the energy these expositions often have, Bild Expo is coming to NYC this June 2025 and is set to be a show like no other. Part of B\u0026H’s 50-year celebration, Bild Expo first launched back in 2023 as you might remember. One of the few expositions left in NYC, the Bild Expo’s affiliation with B\u0026H basically translates into a fully packed convention space with everyone who is anyone showing up. From the convention’s website: “Bild is where you will get inspired by world-class speakers, fine-tune your talents through hands-on experiences and workshops, and try the latest gear at the industry’s largest brand expo. Bild’s two days and nights will be jam-packed with inspiration, camaraderie, and a ton of fun. Many of us enjoyed the incredible excitement of the first Bild Expo in September 2023; we’re thrilled to bring to you Bild Expo 2025 which will be even bigger and even better. And just like last time, Bild Expo is absolutely free to attend!” That last part should be of particular interest to anyone who might be in the area. After all, it is hard to beat the price of free. Held June 17-18, 2025 at NYC’s Javits Center, the convention promises gear, presentations, specials, portfolio reviews, and evening events, the website reports. Sounds like more than a good time if you can make it. Will you be heading to any conventions this year? Let us know in the comments. We have some more news for you to check out here.
