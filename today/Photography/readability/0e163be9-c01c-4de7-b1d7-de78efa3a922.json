  "text": "Wondershare’s award-winning Filmora 14 video editing software promises groundbreaking new features, including new artificial intelligence (AI) technology that ensures video editors and creators can spend more time doing what they love, creating fantastic content, and less time on their computer, all without sacrificing the quality of their work. Full disclosure: This sponsored article is brought to you by Wondershare. Filmora 14 embraces AI in numerous beneficial ways and includes more than 10 new AI-powered tools to improve efficiency and help creators deliver even better content. Filmora 14’s New AI Features Streamline Video Editing and Help Creators Deliver Even Better Content Smart Short Clips Among these is an innovative Smart Short Clips feature. Smart Short Clips uses multiple AI capabilities to independently process video clips, find and extract highlights, and perform fully automatic editing. No matter the user’s video files, Smart Short Clips will find the most exciting moments to create short, vertical clips ideal for sharing on popular social media platforms. The final video features AI-created subtitles, clever sound effects, stickers, and even transitions while simultaneously supporting scheduled publishing across multiple platforms. Short-form content is a major deal for brands and creators, and Smart Short Clips makes the editing process easy. Multi-Camera Editing Filmora 14 offers much more than automatic video editing; it also includes a ton of user control. With Filmora 14, creators can edit video from multiple camera angles on a single timeline track, including footage from various cameras. With Multi-Camera Editing, it’s easy to switch perspectives during editing. This is ideal for content like interviews shot with multiple cameras, tutorials with different camera angles for the presenter and action sequences, recording and sharing video content from stage performances and presentations, and even showcasing replays from sporting events. Planar Tracking Planar Tracking is another sophisticated new feature available in Filmora 14. This editing and effects technique enables editors to track the movement of flat surfaces within a video clip. Thanks to this advanced tracking technology, which analyzes four points on a plane such as a screen or a billboard, users can easily attach images, graphics, text, or another video clip to flat surfaces in their footage. AI Sound Effect Good video editing goes beyond video and relies on immersive sound. With simple text prompts, Filmora 14’s advanced artificial intelligence can automatically generate smooth, context-appropriate sound effects and transitions. Imagine a scenario where primary footage of B-roll shows a busy city environment, but you don’t have high-quality audio to work with. AI Sound Effect can automatically generate fitting background sounds to match the setting, ensuring the viewer remains connected to the final video. AI Video Enhancer But what if your video isn’t up to your or your client’s expectations? No problem, as Filmora 14’s AI Video Enhancer uses AI to improve video quality by restoring detail to blurred-focus or low-resolution video. This is great for times when you don’t have access to a high-quality camera — like when you must use a smartphone’s front-facing display or computer webcam — or when reusing footage shot on older, lesser cameras. AI Color Palette Filmora 14 includes robust color grading and correction tools for experienced video editors. However, not everyone has the skill or time to retouch and tweak their video’s colors manually. AI Color Palette uses smart AI to replicate the color scheme and look of reference photos and videos, instantly transforming your video into a cinematic masterpiece. Don’t worry — the AI is clever and won’t create unnatural skin tones, even if you have chosen an aggressive new look for your video project. AI Video Translation and Lip Sync Many brands and creators make content for global audiences, meaning they rely on subtitles to connect with all their viewers. Filmora 14 takes that further by using AI to translate audio accurately and clone the speaker’s voice into a newly selected language. It can even sync their lips, making the edited content look natural. This is a powerful way to connect with a broader audience, and Filmora 14 supports this new feature across 23 languages, including English, Spanish, German, Japanese, Chinese, and Hindi, among many more. Filmora 14’s Powerful AI Features Promise Better Videos in Fewer Clicks From new features designed to enable novice video editors to quickly and easily create, schedule, and share high-quality content across all the major platforms to sophisticated new tools designed to provide robust control to professional editors, Filmora 14 has groundbreaking improvements for everyone. Video is an increasingly common and essential way for influencers and brands to connect with their audience. Whether a seasoned videographer or a marketer, Filmora 14 ensures everyone working with video can work faster and smarter while creating better content that connects more deeply with viewers. Filmora 14’s new AI features comprise a meaningful evolution in video editing and expand the boundaries of what users can do with their content. Filmora 14 Is Available Now for Desktop and Mobile Filmora 14 is available to try for free. The video editing software works with Windows, macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and Android.
