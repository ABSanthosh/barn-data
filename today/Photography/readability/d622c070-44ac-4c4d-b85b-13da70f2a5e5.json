  "description": "This is a short clip (a little over three minutes) from The Grid (our weekly podcast that airs every Wednesday at 1:00 PM ET) where somebody asked a question about unacceptable amounts of noise in their high ISO shots with their new camera. We talked about why we think he feels this way, and how to deal with it. Check out the short clip below: Let me know if you agree, disagree, or if you’re dealing with noise in a different way, etc., down in the comments. The Photoshop World Conference 2024 is coming up next month! It’s back again on Sept. 24-26, 20204, and it’s three full days, multiple training tracks, all online, featuring your favorite Photoshop World instructors and the Photoshop World experience, complete with an opening keynote, the attendee party, the Guru Awards — the whole nine yards and it’s going to be awesome!

Have a great week everybody – I’m taking a few days to take my awesome wifey on a trip to celebrate her birthday, but I’ll be back shortly (well, if all goes well. LOL!).
