  "description": "Iâ€™m up here with my dear friends (and KelbyOne Instructors) Mimo Meidany and Dave Williams, doing a hands-on travel photography workshop for 12 photographers from the US and UK, and we are already having a ball. ABOVE: Thatâ€™s Mimo, me, and Dave somewhere in Lofoten. Yesterday and today, we have just been scouting locations all over Lofoten for the workshop. Then, the workshop kicks off tomorrow night at a great local restaurant where weâ€™ll have a tasty dinner as a group and lots of wine, then weâ€™ll give our first official briefing for the next dayâ€™s shooting adventure. I just cannot wait! This place is just otherworldly. Indescribable beauty (right now, there is a little bit of rain, too â€“ but with any luck, it will have mostly moved on by tomorrow afternoon. At least, thatâ€™s what weâ€™re hoping). So, not much Lightroom stuff to share today, so Iâ€™m hoping Rob will sweep in and save the day with this column (as he so often does), but I just wanted to say hi to everybody and hereâ€™s wishing you a week of great images, no matter where you are. ðŸ™‚ -Scott The post Howdy, From Norwayâ€™s Lofoten Islands! appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",
