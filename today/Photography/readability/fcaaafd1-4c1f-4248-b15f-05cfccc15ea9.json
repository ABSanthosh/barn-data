  "description": "Itâ€™s the longest Iâ€™ve been away from home (and work) â€“Â a whole month, and while I had an absolutley fantastic time, itâ€™s great to be back. First, I taught a workshop in Norway, then after a few days with some dear friends in England. After that my wife flew over to London to meet me, where we boarded a cruise ship for a trip around England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and Northern Ireland, and back to Norway to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary. I put together a Web page (using Adobe Express) with some of my favorite images from before the workshop (during our scouting days) and then from the workshop (including lots of behind-the-scenes images). Lots to share and the story behind it all, if youâ€™ve got a sec. Hereâ€™s a link to the images: https://new.express.adobe.com/webpage/r3WsEHRGQfqdj Thanks for giving â€™em a quick look. ðŸ™‚ Itâ€™s great to be back, and Iâ€™ll be hitting ya with some more Lightroom tips later this week. ðŸ™‚ Cheers, -Scott The post Iâ€™m Back From Norway (and hereâ€™s some photos) appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",
