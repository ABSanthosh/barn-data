Their drones range from beginner's to professional models and the technologies, hardware used are constantly improved with each new model. While a lot of drone professionals have been waiting for this new drone that has been rumoured about, DJI released a new teaser on its channels, which is a very short video clip titled “Spin Your World.” It looks like the drone's gimbal is capable of rotating, which means it will be a great feature for filmmakers and content creators to capture dramatic aerial footage. The released video can be seen below: The video released by DJI shows how the drone is capable of capturing more dynamic videos using unique perspectives. The footage on DJI's social media like X and YouTube, also shows a three camera system which is spherical with “Hasselblad” written on top. The spherical system may allow for more flexibility for the cameras to move sideways, up and down and may come with advanced stabilization features. A lot of rumoured information have been flooding online sites and forums about the new drone and its specifications. Followers on social media and especially drone enthusiasts, seem to be very excited about this new technology and predict this drone could be a Mavic 4 Pro following DJI's Mavic 3 series. The new drone seems to have a compact foldable design like its predecessors and may be weighing less than a kilogram. This also means that the drone pilot will need a license to fly the drone in most countries. The product is expected to be launched next week on the 13th of May. We have more news for you to read if you are interested at this link here.",
