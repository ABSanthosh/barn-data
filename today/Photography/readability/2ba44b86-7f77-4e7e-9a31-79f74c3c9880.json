Don’t ask me why – I don’t run the company.As you may not be aware, BCN collects sales data from around 60% of all retailers in Japan, so it’s a very accurate look at the Japanese market. The Japanese spend more per capita on camera equipment than anyone else, so it’s important for us to report on. Also, what happens in Japan usually trends outward into Asia and other regions.Also, it’s a matter of pride for Japanese companies to have high sales rankings in Japan. Canon, for instance, takes a very dim view of not finishing #1.I find the rankings a bit of a surprise overall, especially for mirrorless – for starters, Canon did not release any cameras until the R5 Mark II, and no camera under $4200 or 1 million yen was sure to stumble sales this year. Canon being in #2 for mirrorless doesn’t surprise me; what does is Nikon jumping for the first time in over 10 years to #3 in mirrorless sales. Well done, Nikon.Olympus has been steadily losing market share every year, so it was a matter of time until it slipped out of the top 3. This was the year.Canon had 26% of the market, but Sony held the dominant amount of sales with nearly 10% more, at 35.8%. Much of that is because Sony released a less expensive APS-C model earlier in the year, which easily helped Sony keep the #1 position in 2024. The ZV-E10 II has no competition from Canon, but I suspect Canon will rectify that situation this year. I hope they do it with both an APS-C and a full-frame model similar to Sony.Sony ZV-E10 IIFor DSLRs – there wasn’t much of a surprise there; there are so few being sold in Japan that it is next to meaningless these days. From January through November, only 28,902 DSLRs were shipped to Japan. But since I like pretty graphs, we see that Canon continues to overwhelm everyone in terms of what is left of the DSLR market in Japan.Overall, they slipped from 77.1% down to 69.4%, but I doubt that anyone in Japan is losing sleep over it. Interestingly, this was Ricoh’s best year in terms of market share, but in terms of absolute units shipped and sold, probably not.Canon also ranks out of the top 3 for the second year in a row in the interchangeable lens category, but to be fair, the top 3 vendors are only about 49.3% of the entire market. Tamron and Sigma switched positions from last year, and Sony held the #3 position as they did the year prior.By the Numbers from BCN Awards 2025Here’s the raw data.
