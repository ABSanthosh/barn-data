They imply that is the case, but it could also mean cheaper interchangeable lens cameras.We want to go fabless with the printers and lower-end digital cameras we manufacture in Asia.As noted by Nikkei, Canon’s plans include positioning the production facilities in Japan as “mother factories” where manufacturing technology for flagship products gets established, and Canon would focus on cutting costs through automation and shifting to supplying its production equipment.Nikki also mentions that Canon hopes to avoid supply chain disruptions and geopolitical risks. With a potential upcoming trade war between the United States and China, it stands to reason that Japan wants nothing of that and needs to move cheaper camera production to another Asian country that has high-tech manufacturing and a cheaper workforce than Japan.With the industry shifting and shipping more compacts than in 2023, it sounds like Canon is making a move to supply some smaller / cheaper cameras to the marketplace, but to set up a new factory from scratch in another country will most likely take time.Canon also has assembly production in Taiwan, and I believe it still has facilities in Vietnam and Malaysia.You can read the entire article here; it is paywalled and requires a login.Source: NikkeiImage Source: Canon NagasakiWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
