UPDATE:  So I was just browsing older articles here on dPS, and came across this gem, remember when Twitter was called Twitter… oh, err, I mean ‘X’ – whatever, you know what I mean! Well we are STILL on X (Twitter) and we’re also on Facebook, we have a private Facebook Group AND we even have an Instagram and Threads account. Do you follow us on any of them / all of them? Which leads me to my next question, do you share your photography on social media? We would love you to share a link to where you share your work, online, in the comments below! For those of you who don’t know Twitter – it is a social site that enables people to share short messages with their followers. It’s known as ‘micro-blogging’ because you only get 140 characters to write your message. There are millions of people ‘Twittering’ – it’s fun and quite addictive. So today we started the Digital Photography School Twitter account. It’s a place where we’ll post messages when we update our blog, announce new assignments in our forums, ask photography questions, take your questions and suggestions. To follow the account just signup as a Twitter user and then ‘follow’ us. Read more from our category I need help with...",
