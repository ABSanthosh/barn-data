Canon did announce a global shutter camera back in 2016, but that was the $40,000 Cinema EOS C700GS. Not really an everyman's camera.Sony decided it was time to shake up the mirrorless camera market again, with equipping a global shutter in the A9 III. It was a very well received camera in the Sony community, but I'm not sure it moved anyone out of their current brand. It comes with some trade-offs such as a higher base ISO of 250 and some dynamic range penalties at lower ISOs.After the release of the EOS R1 and EOS R5 Mark II, Canon executives did address global shutter sensors. They claim they aren't happy with the current image quality performance and have decided to prioritize image quality. I read it that they haven't yet solved problems or figured out a way to manufacture them in a cost effective way. If you know Canon speak, they basically admitted that they are working on it.This past weekend, perhaps drunk at their Thanksgiving family funtimes. A solid source claims that Canon is indeed planning to release a global shutter camera in late 2025 “at the earliest”. A surprising comment was that “it will come in a potentially high-volume camera”. Which isn't really what Sony has done introducing theres in a $6500 camera. That pricepoint never screams “high-volume”. Sony also didn't use their latest and greatest global shutter sensor. I would wager that Sony has a global shutter sensor camera coming at a lower price point at some point in the not too distant future.Richard suggested that a new 3-series camera would be an interesting place to introduce one. However, releasing such a camera just a year after the EOS R1 would probably cause some displeasure among at least a few EOS R1 customers. It also wouldn't fit with “high-volume”.What could be “high-volume”? What if they introduce one in an APS-C camera first? We have said a few times that Canon will introduce new APS-C camera segments in 2025, and one of those will undoubtedly be a videographer focused hybrid camera.Volume does help in lowering costs and there isn't always the same desire from customers for the bleeding edge image quality. APS-C sensors also cost significantly less to put in a camera. That said, Canon would definitely have to get serious about RF-S lenses, which we do think is going to happen next year.EOS R7 GS? Wouldn't that be interesting?Just to reiterate, I am only hypothesising that we're getting a global shutter APS-C camera, but that's all I can think of for the moment based on what I was told.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
