This post is dedicated each year to the memory of David Leimbach (shown above; the brother of my dear friend and colleague Jeff Leimbach), who died 17 years ago in combat in Afghanistan. Just a humble word of thanks to the dedicated men and women of our armed services and to all those who came before them who laid down their lives to protect the freedoms we enjoy each day. Here’s wishing you all a safe, happy, and healthy Memorial Day. -Scott The post A DAY TO HONOR OUR NATION’S FALLEN SOLDIERS appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",
