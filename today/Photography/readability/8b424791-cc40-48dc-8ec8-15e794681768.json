The clamp and stud SpeedLevel system saves precious time leveling your camera rig by eliminating the need to screw on a tie-down knob.Designed for larger DSLRs, mirrorless, and digital cine-style cameras, the aktiv8T supports rigs weighing up to 26.5 pounds. This fluid head features 15 steps of counterbalance and seven steps of pan and tilt drag adjustment, plus zero settings for both balance and drag.The SpeedLevel technology replaces the traditional head screw and tie-down design with a strong clamp built into the head bowl and a stud component that clamps onto your tripod bowl or other mounting platform, such as a slider.Simply grasp the large lever on the head and pull it up to release the clamp, then press it down to lock your head in place. Partially lifting the lever allows you to quickly and easily level the head.When used with a separately available flowtech tripod, the activ8T enables you to spread the legs flat, getting as low to the ground as your head can without a tie-down knob getting in the way. You can also now mount your head directly onto a slider using a separately available aktiv system stud that screws onto support systems with a 3/8″-16 threaded stud.The PrismBubble level system is pressed once to illuminate the bubble level to be illuminated or pressed twice to light up both the bubble level and the drag settings, a boon when working in darker environments. The bubble level also has a built-in prism, enabling you to more easily level the head when the legs are at set at maximum height or an awkward angle.Mount your camera using the aktiv8T Touch \u0026 Go plate with both 1/4-20″ and 3/8″-16 camera screws. A sliding range of 2.4″ helps the head to quickly balance variously configured rigs. The Sachtler aktiv8T head also features a detachable pan bar that can be mounted onto the rosettes on either the right or left side of the head.Purchase OptionsSachtler aktiv8T flowtech75 MS Tripod System $2337 (Reg $3937)When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.
