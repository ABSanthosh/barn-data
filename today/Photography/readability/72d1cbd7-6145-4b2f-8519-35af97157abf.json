  "text": "Jim Rhosenthal’s iconic Raising the Flag photo. Ira Hayes is the furthest figure on the left. | Associated Press On Memorial Day, a time to honor the men and women who died while serving in the military, PetaPixel looks at the life of soldier Ira Hayes in four photos. Hayes was a Native American marine and one of the six men in Jim Rosenthal’s iconic Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima photo. Hayes’ Marine Corps recruitment photo (1942). Born on the Gila River Indian Reservation in Arizona, he was originally assigned to the 3rd Marine Parachute Battalion, where he saw combat during the Bougainville Campaign. In 1944, Hayes was reassigned to the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines as an infantryman, in preparation for the Marine Corps assault on the Japanese island stronghold of Iwo Jima. His inclusion in the Raising the Flag photograph brought him fame, he was one of only three surviving flag-raisers brought back to the U.S. and was used to promote war bonds. But Hayes found the limelight deeply uncomfortable, haunted by survivor’s guilt and suffering with PTSD. He reportedly disliked being called a hero, feeling the true heroes were those who never made it home.

(Photo by PhotoQuest/Getty Images) Hayes, who was born on the Gila River Indian Reservation in Arizona in 1923, returned there after the war. But the trauma of war and the pressures of fame had taken its toll. He suffered from what we now recognize as PTSD and turned to alcohol to cope. He was arrested multiple times for public intoxication and became increasingly isolated. On January 24, 1955, at just 32 years old, Hayes was found dead from exposure and alcohol poisoning in a ditch near his home.

He had been working as a handyman and chauffeur for comedian Dean Martin’s ex-wife, who had hired him after hearing of his last arrest for drunkenness in Chicago. | AP Photo/Los Angeles Mirror Despite his tragic end, Hayes’ story has resonated. He was portrayed by Tony Curtis in the 1961 film The Outsider, and his life inspired the folk song The Ballad of Ira Hayes, written by Peter LaFarge and famously recorded by Johnny Cash.
