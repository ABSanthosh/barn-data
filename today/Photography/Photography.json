In his brand-new class, Moose Peterson shows you how going back and looking at your own photos can seriously help you grow as a photographer. Moose walks you through his exact process for digging into his photo archives—not just to relive great moments, but to really study what’s working, what’s not, and how to get better. It’s honestly one of the best ways to improve your composition, your lighting, your post-processing… everything. The more photos you take, the more you’ve got this built-in library of lessons just waiting to be uncovered. It’s like leaving yourself little clues for how to become a better photographer every time you go out. And Moose is gonna show you how to spot them. This is such a simple but powerful approach, and by the end of the class, you’ll be thinking about your own work in a totally new way. You’re gonna love it. Check it out here!

    "description": "Sure enough, no sooner had I posted a link to my post from Friday on my Facebook page than someone had to comment that they wouldn’t subscribe to any of Adobe’s plans. Ugh. I didn’t take it up with him there, but for all those still holding out (and “stickin’ it to the man”), there have been hundreds of enhancements added over the years that make both Lightroom and Photohsop work better, much faster, much easier, with much better workflows all around, but beyond all that – here are some of the big features you’ve missed in Lr and Ps by holding out : LIGHTROOM: Of course, none of this includes all the Camera support updates, or Len Profile updates or like I mentioned, all the myriad of tweaks and enhancements that make Lightroom so, so much better than it was before. Important to note: As I mentioned on “The Grid,” if we consider only the standard rate of inflation, which Adobe has already taken into account with the perpetual model, today’s perpetual price would be approximately $1,355.00. All at once. Up front. This does not include upgrades. They would be $225 every year to 18 months based on those same inflation rates. Of course, you don’t have to upgrade; you could continue to use outdated software with fewer features and no camera or lens updates, but most users didn’t skip those updates for those very reasons. To the holdouts: you can use faster, better software with more features, or you can keep “sticking it to the man.” Your call. Have a kick butt Monday, everybody! -Scott P.S. We are just two weeks away from the Travel Photography Conference sponsoed by the awesome folks at On1.

    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",
