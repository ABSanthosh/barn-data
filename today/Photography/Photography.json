    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",

    "description": "A few years back deepfakes seemed to be the latest concern de jour. Now they’re back and with a vengeance although, this time around, they’re part of a broader generative AI wave that’s taking multiple industries by storm. What’s becoming impressive across the board is the sophistication of these models. What’s impressive in this particular […] The post ByteDance Shows Off Ultra-Realistic Deepfake Generative AI appeared first on Light Stalking.",

    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/applying-content-credentials-on-export/",
    "description": "As part of the Adobe MAX release of Lightroom Classic and Lightroom we gained the ability to apply what Adobe is calling Content Credentials to copies on export. This is an Early Access feature, so expect changes as it evolves. What are Content Credentials? You can think of them as a special type of metadata that can strengthen the connection between you and your work shared online, which can either be embedded in the exported copy (JPG only right now), uploaded to Adobe’s content credential cloud (separate from the cloud storage used by Lightroom), or both. This is all completely optional, and you can also export copies without any of it too. Adobe has a great Content Credentials FAQ to learn more. To get started, select a photo for export, and click the Export button to open the Export dialog. Scroll down to the Content Credentials (Early Access) panel and click the Manage link. Note, if the panel is grayed out/inaccessible, go up to the File Settings panel and choose JPEG for the file type. This will take you to the page where you can connect your social media accounts to your credentials. When you return back to the Export dialog, click the Refresh button to update what is displayed in the Export dialog (Internet connection is required for the above to work). With that refreshed, you can now choose your storage method for how the content credential is connected to your work. There is also the option for Don’t Include for anytime you don’t want to do any of this. Then, use the checkboxes to mark the pieces of information you want to include with the credential. For example, if you connected your Instagram account in the Manage step earlier, you can check that box to have a link to your Instagram account included with the credential. That’s all there is to it. Then configure the rest of the Export dialog as you would normally and click Export to finish. I attached content credentials to this photo below. This was edited in Lightroom Classic’s Develop module after using the Denoise function to create a DNG copy with noise reduction. I also used the Generative Remove function to remove a bit of the lens flare from the sun. Adobe has an Inspect Tool that you can use to check the content credentials of photos. Right-click the photo above to download it and run it through the inspector tool to see what I mean. Here’s a snippet below from the Inspect results: I’m excited about the ability to strengthen the connection between our online work and ourselves as creators of that work. This is still incredibly early days in the development of this technology, and I don’t how widespread its adoption will be, but I am glad to see its inclusion in Lightroom Classic and Lightroom. Has anyone else used it? The post Applying Content Credentials on Export appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",

    "description": "It just got released yesterday, and here’s one of the first comments on it: I did the course as 25 separate lessons, so in the future, if you want to go back to any particular tip, you can go directly to it. You can buy the course, download it, and watch it today for $29 (here’s the link), but if you’re a KelbyOne Member, you can just stream it on demand as part of your membership – you’ll see it on your dashboard as this week’s course (we release a new course every week). I hope you can check it out (it would be a fun thing to do this weekend, since there’s no football. Well, no interesting football anyway). On Tuesday, I’m off to Antarctica as one of the instructors on the Muench Workshops trip, and I’m super psyched. There’s a lot to do between now and then (and I better start charging my batteries, eh).
