One particularly captivating approach is using long shutter techniques—also known as long exposure photography—to capture expressive motion in a single, dynamic shot. If you’ve admired images of silky waterfalls, glowing city streets, or sweeping star trails, you’re witnessing the artistic use of long shutter speeds. Let’s dive into how you can harness these techniques to create compelling […] The post Long Shutter Techniques for Impactful Imagery appeared first on 500px.",

    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/the-only-reason-i-would-ever-choose-open-original-when-taking-an-image-over-to-photoshop/",
    "description": "If you took an image from Lightroom over into Photoshop for some editing and you added some layers to your image, when you save that image and it comes back to Lightroom, you’ll just see what looks like the flattened image, but don’t worry – those layers will still be intact. There’s no way to see them in Lightroom, because Lightroom doesn’t have a Layers feature. Now, what happens if you take that image –  the one you know has layers, from Lightroom back over to Photoshop? Well, if you choose “Edit a Copy with Lightroom Adjustments” (the one I normally choose for any image I’m editing over in Photoshop) or just “Edit a copy”, all your layers will be gone. The image will be flattened. So, how can you reopen that image and have all the layers still intact? This is one case where I change how I take the image over to Photoshop from Lightroom. Don’t choose “make a copy.” Instead (and this is the one instance I do this), choose ‘Edit Original.” Now, when the image opens in Photoshop, look over in the Layers panel and all the original layers will still be intact. Last Chance to Attend The Online Travel Photography Conference The classes start on Tuesday – it’s The Travel Photography Conference (sponsored by the folks at On1 Software), and it’s not too late to get your ticket. Lots of great instructors (I’m teaching two of the classes: one on creating your travel photography shot list, and one on what makes a great travel photo). If you sign up today, you can attend the conference orientation tomorrow and also catch Erik Kuna’s pre-conference session on Monday. Then, on Tuesday, it’s two full days, two full tracks, and tons of learning how to take and edit the best travel photography images of your life. Sign up right now at kelbyonelive.com and we’ll see you online! P.S. Please share this with anyone you think will get a lot out of this conference. Thanks in advance.

    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",
