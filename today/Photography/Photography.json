    "title": "Creating Smart Albums in Lightroom",
    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/creating-smart-albums-in-lightroom/",
    "description": "One of the new additions to the Lightroom app for Windows and Mac is the ability to create what they are calling smart albums which you should think of as saved searches (just like smart collections in Lightroom Classic). A smart album is simply a set of customized search criteria that you employ to automatically (and continuously) gather photos and videos that meet those criteria. The first method of creation is to click the + sign at the top of the Albums section and choose Create Smart album from the contextual menu. This opens the dialog for giving your smart album a descriptive name, placing it within a folder to stay organized, and adding the rules to be followed for gathering the files you want to see. Note, you’ll want to create the parent folder first, as there is not a way to create a new folder from within the Create Smart album dialog at this time. Then, click the +Add New Rule button at the bottom of the dialog to access the list of available criteria. Currently, you can create a smart album based on any combination of the following: For example, I wanted to monitor all of the videos I have imported into Lightroom as those will always be stored full resolution in the cloud and counting against storage quota (unlike smart previews synced from Lightroom Classic). So, I chose Type as the criteria, and then chose Video from the list of possible Types. Once you’ve added all of the desired criteria, entered a name, and (optionally) put it in a folder (you can always drag and drop it into a folder later), click Create to exit the dialog and put that smart album to work. It will appear in the left panel within the chosen folder. Over time, it continually updates to add any new files that match the criteria and remove any files that no longer meet the criteria. Another way to create a smart album is to use the filter next to the search field at the top. Clicking that filter icon reveals all of the criteria you can filter your library against, and for the most part it is the same as the list of criteria you can find within the Create Smart album dialog box except for Sync Status (which is not something you can use in a smart album). Note, if you want to have your smart album search your entire library, click All Photographs first, then use the filter. If you want to filter within a specific album or folder, click that album/folder first, then open the filter to add the criteria for the smart album. For example, to create a filter on the photos with a rating equal to or greater than 1 within the folder containing all of my family albums, I’ll click on the Family folder first to view the content of all the albums within it, then engage the filter at the top. With the filter open, I’ll click the 1 star and choose the greater than or equal icon, and a blue Create Smart Album button appears. Click that blue button to complete the creation of the smart album, where you can give it a name, choose to put it in a folder, verify the criteria you’ve chosen, and even edit the criteria further if desired. Once named, click the Create button to complete the process. This is still early in the development of this feature, so I’m sure there will be refinements in the future. For now, you’ll need to keep in mind that these smart albums on exist in the Windows/Mac version of Lightroom. They do not sync across to other Lightroom apps on mobile or web, and they do not sync to Lightroom Classic. So while limited, it is a welcome addition to the Lightroom feature set.

    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/how-to-add-generative-expand-to-camera-raw/",
    "description": "You might have already heard from Adobe’s Photoshop update announcement on Monday, but a Beta version of Generative Expand is now available inside Photoshop’s Camera Rawr (and coming to Lightroom next, since all the stuff added to ACR also comes to Lightroom, but usually it’s Lightroom that gets the feature first, then ACR, but let’s not quibble). Anyway, it’s pretty incredible, but you WON’T SEE THIS FEATURE until you turn this feature on first. Here’s how: STEP ONE: Launch Photoshop (after, of course, you’ve downloaded the latest update which was released on Monday), and from the bottom of the Settings menu, choose “Camera Raw’ (as shown above). STEP TWO: In the list of Camera Raw preferences that appear on the left side of the window, click on “Technology Previews” to bring up the window you see here. Then, turn on the checkbox for “New AI Features and Settings Panel,” as shown above. STEP THREE: Once you do that, open an image in Camera Raw (the full plug-in, not as a filter from Ps) and click on the Crop tool. It will now say “Crop \u0026 Expand” at the top of the panel, and you’ll see some new features below. Turn on the checkbox for “Enable Expand” (as shown here), and now you’re ready to rock. In the next two steps, we’ll look at how it works now that you have it turned on. STEP FOUR: with ‘Enable Expand’ turned on, you can now drag the cropping border outside the edges of the image (instead of just cropping in tighter like normal). So, if you wanted to make this image wide or square (instead of tall), you could drag out the side handles (as shown here). STEP FIVE: once you have the borders where you want them, click the ‘Generate Button’ (as shown here), and it generates what it needs to fill in those empty spaces to give you the wide image you see above. You have three variations to choose from, using the Variations arrows to toggle through each to find the one that looks best. If you don’t like any of them, hit the Generate button again. And that’s all there is to it. Can’t wait until this gets added to Lightroom in an update. 🙂 Join Us For “The Wildlife Photography Conference” coming in December It’s just a little over a month from now, and it’s two days, all online, and everyone’s invited to spend a few days with us learning, laughing, and making new connections.

    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years.
