    "title": "Time To Update Your Copyright Info Inside of Lightroom",
    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/time-to-update-your-copyright-info-inside-of-lightroom/",
    "description": "Hi, everybody – I’m back from my holiday break (really enjoyed it, and although the College football gods were not awesome to me, there’s still NFL hope. If the Bucs beat the Saints this Sunday, we win the NFC South and head to a home Playoff game, so there’s that). Now, it’s a new year full of new opportunities and possibilities, so let’s get right to it. If, like me, you like to embed your copyright and contact info directly into your images (handy in case you share images on Instagram, FB, X [formerly Twitter], etc.), then it’s time to update your Lightroom Classic copyright info template for 2025 for the new images you take and import this year. It’s really simple but not super obvious, so here we go: STEP ONE: Go to the Library Module; go under the Metadata menu up top and choose Edit Metadata Presets as shown above (NOTE: if you don’t already have an existing Copyright template in place, you use this same menu to create one from scratch, so either way you would choose this Edit Metadata Presets to get started). STEP TWO: When the Edit Metadata Presets window appears (shown above), choose the name of the preset you want to edit, and it will display your copyright template info (as seen). In my case, I’m editing last year’s Copyright preset, but if you don’t already have one, scroll down to the IPTC Copyright section and start typing your info there and the IPTC Creator section below it, as I have above. STEP THREE: Go to the IPTC Copyright section, click on the field to the right of Copyright (as shown above), then type in 2025 right over where it previously said 2024. If you’re creating your first Copyright template, just go ahead and type in 2025 and your name in the Copyright field, and then under Copyright Status, choose “Copyrighted” from the pop-up menu. STEP FOUR: Once you’ve updated the date, it’s time to save your new preset by going to the Preset pop-up menu at the top of the window and choosing “Save Current Settings as New Preset,” as shown above. STEP FIVE: This brings up a small dialog where you can enter the name for your New Preset (as seen above). STEP SIX: If you don’t have any old 2022 images you haven’t yet imported into Lightroom, you can choose to delete last year’s preset if you want (you won’t be using it again if you’ve already imported all your images from last year), so if you want to delete it (totally up to you  — you don’t have to – you can keep multiple year’s templates, no sweat), first choose the old 2022 Preset from the pop-up menu; then go to the same pop-up menu again but this time choose Delete Preset “Scott’s Copyright 2022” (or whatever you named it), then click the Done button. STEP SEVEN: APPLYING YOUR NEW COPYRIGHT PRESET: There are two ways (OK, probably more) to apply these presets. However, my favorite is to embed this copyright data into your images right during the Import process. In Lightroom Classic’s Import window, in the “Apply During Import” panel (seen above right), where it says “Metadata,” choose your Copyright preset from that pop-up menu. As your images are imported, your copyright status and contact info are automatically embedded into each photo. The second method is for images you’ve taken this year and already imported into Lightroom. STEP EIGHT: If you have images taken in 2024 and they’re already imported into Lightroom, then select all those images, and then, in the Library module of Classic, go to the Metadata panel, and right near the top, you’ll see “Preset.” Click on that pop-up menu (as shown above) and choose your Copyright preset, and it will be applied to all those photos you selected at once. IMPORTANT NOTE: Embedding this info into your image does not provide you with official copyright protection. I am not an attorney, so this is not legal advice, but what embedding this info does is let people who download your image know that: a) This is a copyrighted image and is NOT free for you to use. b) it gives them your contact info if they want to buy or license your image. But just to be clear, doing all this DOES NOT actually copyright your images — that is done separately (at least here in the US) by the govt. Copyright office. If you want to learn how to actually copyright and protect your images (so important if you’re going to be sharing your images online), then check out this fantastic (and actually fun) course from Intellectual Property attorney Ed Greenberg and Photographer’s Rights Advocate Jack Reznicki over at KelbyOne.com (here’s the direct link to their course). OK, we’re off and running in a new year, and here’s wishing you a safe, happy, healthy 2025 – one with lots of lightrooming, Photoshopshopping and photography, and football (#GoBucs!), and lots of other fun stuff. 🙂 -Scott P.S. While you’re updating Lightroom’s Copyright info, now’s a great time to update your camera’s copyright info as well (and if you haven’t added your copyright info in your camera, well, no time like the present, my dad always used to say).

We’re excited to announce the launch of ON1 Pro, a new brand from ON1 designed to meet the unique workflow challenges faced by professional photographers. While ON1 is expanding with this new line, they’re not going anywhere—their nearly 20 years of developing photo editing software will continue to power everything they do, including growing the ON1 product line and ON1 Photo RAW. The first product under the new ON1 Pro brand, Lightpanel, is an AI assistant that works seamlessly inside Adobe Lightroom Classic. This new application, designed for high-volume portrait and wedding photographers, will deliver AI-driven culling, AI-driven editing, and soon, job tracking—right inside the Lightroom Classic workflow. All of it is designed to cut the culling and editing time in half. As award-winning Photoshop, photography \u0026 Lightroom author Scott Kelby puts it: “Instead of requiring photographers to learn a new product, Lightpanel supercharges the workflows we already have, cutting workloads in half.” Learn more about ON1 Pro and Lightpanel in their overview video.

    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",
