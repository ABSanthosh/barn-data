    "description": "Morning, everybody. I just got back from San Francisco, attending Adobe’s Photography Community Summit. They brought together 24 photographers, content creators, and educators from around the world to connect directly with Adobe’s Lightroom team (I met photographers from Japan, Finland, the UK, Germany, Italy, Australia, and more, and it was really great to hang out with these two fine gents above). It was a really great opportunity to meet directly with the Lightroom team and share our thoughts, ideas, suggestions, and anything we thought might be valuable to help steer, nudge, or influence the future development of Lightroom (and yes, I carried the messages you all have let me know matter to you. I talked with the team about them directly. To Death. I’ll be surprised if they ever ask me back). Anyway, it was a fantastic three days – I met some absolutely great people, from the photographers and educators I met to the Adobe folks, who are so incredibly dedicated to making a really great experience and an excellent product for their customers. They are really passionate about it, and you feel that when you talk with them, and I’m glad this group of folks are behind the product that means a lot to us all. Hope you all have a great weekend. Catch you next week. 🙂 -Scott P.S. In the thumbnail shot you saw on the previous page, that’s (from L to R); Me, Matt, Glyn, Aaron, Pye, and Ron.

    "description": "If your Lightroom Classic starts acting up (hey, it happens), the first thing I usually try is to quit Lightroom and restart it (same fix as your phone, right?). If that doesn’t work, Plan B is to reset Lightroom’s preference back to their factory fresh defaults. This doesn’t delete your presets or custom brushes, but asking for a new set of preferences will usually fix what just restarting doesn’t. However, as you know (from the headline), this button is hidden. Here’s how to uncover it. Above: Here’s Lightroom’s Preferences ‘General’ tab. Note the lonely ‘Reset all warnings dialog’ at the bottom center. If you hold the Option key (PC: Alt-key), you’ll notice that some new buttons appear, and now the center button reads “Reset all preferences and relaunch.” That’s the one you click to have Lightroom quit, install a fresh set of preferences, and relaunch. Hope you found that helpful. Have a great Monday, ya’ll (I’m out at Adobe HQ for some meeting this week), but more to come from Rob on Wed, and I’ll be back here on Friday. -Scott P.S. Next month, I’m teaching at the Wildlife Photography Conference (Produced by KelbyOne) with an incredible instructor crew. It’s two days, with two tracks each day and a pre-conference day, too. Best of all, you get the entire conference, all the classes on both tracks and the bonus sessions archived for an entire year to stream on demand. If you register early, you can save $150.

    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",
