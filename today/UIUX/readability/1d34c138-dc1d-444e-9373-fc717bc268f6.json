  "text": "After two decades in design ‚Äî leading teams, managing million-dollar portfolios, and launching products used by millions ‚Äî I‚Äôm now questioning my place.Reflecting on my journey, I‚Äôve had the privilege of navigating the dynamic world of design for over two decades. From leading a 10-person team at my own agency to scaling You.i TV from 22 to more than 210 employees, I grew the design team from 2 to 21 while collaborating with powerhouse brands like the NFL, Fox, Turner Television, and Cartoon Network. This journey ultimately led to a $100 million acquisition by Warner Media. Along the way, I‚Äôve also deepened my expertise in mid-sized companies across B2B, B2C, crypto, and AI sectors, while venturing into the complex world of enterprise software.Yet, despite these accomplishments, I find myself at a crossroads, questioning my place in an industry that has evolved dramatically.This introspection surely isn‚Äôt unique to me.Many mid-career professionals grapple with similar feelings of uncertainty and reevaluation. The challenge lies in aligning one‚Äôs passion and expertise with the industry‚Äôs current demands, all while seeking personal fulfillment and balance.Original design for a Podcast Framer Team template I am working on.Is this a problem?Perhaps it‚Äôs more of an opportunity ‚Äî a chance to redefine success, mentor emerging talent, and leverage our rich experiences in new, innovative ways. The design landscape may have changed, but the core principles of creativity, problem-solving, and human-centric thinking remain as vital as ever.I still love design. The craft. The details. The elegance of a well-thought-out experience. The feeling of bringing something into the world that makes life just a little bit better.But lately, I feel like I‚Äôm standing at a crossroads.I‚Äôm in my 40s (okay, I‚Äôm 48), and my ambitions have shifted over time. Trying to find my voice and build a personal brand as a designer on ùïè, Linkedin and other platforms feels a lot like a teenage identity crisis. The relentless drive I had when I started in this field ‚Äî the late nights, the hustle, the constant push for the next big thing ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt fuel me the same way anymore.I‚Äôve been ‚Äúonline‚Äù for many years, maybe it should have been different, but currently, it feels like I‚Äôm trying to talk to my 16-year-old self‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm continuously questioning myself on here‚Ä¶Should I even? What should I do‚Ä¶ Should I keep going‚Ä¶ Am I trying to be someone else? Mid-life crisis?Personal wallpaper designEvolving through timeI‚Äôm no longer chasing titles, prestige, or the illusion of success defined by external validation. I‚Äôm chasing balance and projects I truly want to work on.I want to create work that matters, but not at the expense of my health, my relationships, or my ability to simply enjoy life. I want deep, meaningful impact ‚Äî not just metrics and optics.I still love design ‚Äî the craft, the problem-solving, and the beauty of creating something meaningful. But the game has changed. And I‚Äôm left wondering what‚Äôs next‚Ä¶ for the industry and myself.AI, the creator economy, fragmentized designers, freelancing, smaller agencies, and so on. The world is evolving so damn fast.‚ÄúTechnology has advanced more in the last thirty years than in the previous two thousand‚Äù ‚Äî Niels BohrDesign isn‚Äôt just about designing anymore. It‚Äôs about playing the online game, building an audience, and becoming a content machine. It feels less about the work and more about marketing yourself.The creator economy is no longer a trend ‚Äî it‚Äôs the new reality. The creator economy is currently valued at approximately $104.2 billion and is projected to double by 2027. Globally, it encompasses a staggering 207 million content creators.Leaders like Justin Welsh, Dan Koe, Naval, Alex Hermozi, Chris Do (and many others) have mastered the game, building massive audiences, establishing undeniable credibility, and turning their ideas into highly profitable courses. They‚Äôve proven that personal branding isn‚Äôt just a buzzword ‚Äî it‚Äôs a business model. But now, as more people chase the same formula for success, the space is becoming an echo chamber. Everyone is optimizing, iterating, and repackaging the same messages, and originality is starting to fade.I see younger designers putting in 20-hour days, grinding, iterating, chasing trends. They create, post, optimize, and repeat ‚Äî relentlessly. And I wonder ‚Äî do I still belong here? Can I still compete? Or is there a different game I should be playing?I got into design because I loved solving problems, making things better, and creating experiences that mattered. Now, I feel like I have to sell myself before I even get to the work. And that‚Äôs exhausting for me. I‚Äôm probably not the only one.This might make me sound like my grandparents reminiscing about the ‚Äúgood old days‚Äù ‚Äî you know, the classic ‚ÄúWhen I was young, we walked five miles to school in 12 feet of snow‚Äù speech. But the truth is, things really have changed.I grew up before the internet was in every pocket. Before social media dictated careers. Before design became a game of algorithms, engagement metrics, and personal branding. I learned design when craftsmanship mattered more than how well you could market yourself.Back then, if you were good at what you did, the work spoke for itself. Now, it often feels like the work is secondary to how well you package and sell it. You can be an incredible designer, but if you‚Äôre not posting daily, optimizing for reach, and playing the social media game, you‚Äôre invisible. Marketing is a new tool every designer needs to master.And that makes me wonder: Is this evolution? Is it a distraction? Is it even for me? Is this what I truly want?As you can see, I‚Äôm questioning a lot right now. Not just about design, but about what‚Äôs next for me. Do I double down and adapt? Or do I carve out a new path that feels more aligned with what I truly want?My biggest challenge has been overcoming my digital shyness. ‚ÄúDoes this reflect 20 years of creative experience?‚Äù floods my head every time I post something. Even if I know I‚Äôve created products used by millions, I often feel like an impostor syndrome when someone posts a fancy button design which gets millions of views.Picture of myself from behindAdapt, evolve or die.Navigating a design career over two decades brings both profound insights and evolving challenges. As I reflect on my own personal journey, I recognize the shifting landscape of our industry and the need to adapt while staying true to one‚Äôs core values.Michael F. Buckley explains it really well. Having the ability to shift your perspective allows us to realign our thinking. For me, it feels like I‚Äôm struggling to see the bigger picture. The rapid rise of new design technologies and specialties in AI advancement is clouding my judgment and shaking my confidence.But, like with everything, sometimes all you need is to step back, take a breath, and regain perspective before moving forward.Embracing change and continuous learningThe design field is in constant flux, with new tools, methodologies, and trends emerging regularly. To remain relevant, it‚Äôs essential to adopt a mindset of lifelong learning. This doesn‚Äôt mean chasing every new trend but rather discerning which advancements align with your design philosophy and can enhance your work.Mentorship ‚Äî Sharing wisdom and gaining new insightsOne of the most fulfilling aspects of a long-standing career is the opportunity to mentor emerging designers. Sharing experiences not only aids in their development but also offers fresh viewpoints that can reignite your passion. Mentorship is a two-way street; while you provide guidance, you also gain insights into new design paradigms and cultural shifts. Organizations like ADPList connect designers globally for mentorship opportunities.Redefining success ‚Äî Aligning career with personal valuesWith experience comes clarity about what truly matters. It‚Äôs crucial to periodically assess your career goals and ensure they align with your personal values. This might mean prioritizing projects that offer meaningful impact over those that merely add to your portfolio. An article on UX Collective delves into building a design career that resonates with one‚Äôs core beliefs.Building an authentic personal brandIn today‚Äôs digital age, establishing a personal brand is vital. However, authenticity should be at its core. Share your journey, including both triumphs and challenges. This transparency not only humanizes you but also builds trust within the design community.Prioritizing well-being ‚Äî The foundation of sustainable creativityThe drive to excel can sometimes lead to burnout. It‚Äôs imperative to establish boundaries, practice self-care, and seek support when needed. Remember, your well-being is the bedrock of sustained creativity and innovation.Picture Picture of me and my family on a vacation to Xochomilco, MexicoWrapping this open-hearted conversationMaybe you‚Äôve felt this too ‚Äî the pull to evolve, but not knowing exactly where to go next. The sense that the industry is shifting, and you‚Äôre trying to figure out where you fit in all of it.While the design industry continues to evolve, anchoring oneself in continuous learning, authentic connections, and personal well-being can provide a compass to navigate the journey. Embracing these principles ensures that we not only stay relevant but also find fulfillment in the work we create.I don‚Äôt have the answers yet. But I know I‚Äôm not alone in this. If you‚Äôre feeling the same way, let‚Äôs talk. Let‚Äôs figure it out together.I‚Äôm currently a Design Principal \u0026 Creative Director at SAP, a spiritual and a health enthusiast. I write about design, skills, careers, and systems. I‚Äôm all ears for your take on anything design or, feel free to connect with me on Linkedin or X.",
