  "text": "Modern product teams have access to some powerful tools which can speed up the creation of new customer experiences, regardless of their working location. But friction can occur if work is scattered across multiple platforms, or even in the same platform, if it’s buried in unorganized lists of links. Our recent webinar, InVision + Figma: A perfect match, discussed this exact topic. In this session, we explored why they are a perfect match for creating new products and features while keeping work visible to all stakeholders.  This ranges from the engineers, designers, and product managers working directly on the product, to other stakeholders who need to give feedback and clear roadblocks to ship work efficiently. In this webinar, Mark Boyes Smith (Product Design Director at InVision) and Hannah Koh (Solutions Consultant at InVision) share how InVision’s Freehand works for design, product and engineering teams in tandem with Figma. They explore what InVision has evolved to be (hint: a collaborative workspace), and they share how we run our design practice internally using InVision and Figma. Surfacing all of our work in one place  InVision has become a place to surface all of our work in one place, through the power of a collaborative canvas, Freehand, along with powerful integrations with tools like Figma. Mark shows how his team runs design reviews using a Freehand template that integrates with Figma, allowing you to pull in artboards or a live view of a prototype (updates can also be pushed from Figma to Freehand).  Mark and Hannah also discuss how InVision can help turn handoffs into a conversation beyond the design team, involving all the people who bring an experience to life, from UX writers, to Q\u0026A specialists, to Go-to-Market teams.  Bringing squads together \u0026 making work inclusive  Mark and Hannah also discussed two more superpowers of the InVision platform: bringing squads together and making work more inclusive. Mark starts things off by discussing how we approach our product teams from a DesignOps perspective.  Mark shares the InVision Space where the central design team collects artifacts from architecture planning to brand elements, to keep everyone on the same page and onboard new hires. It’s also a place to build team culture, with a Freehand template for icebreakers and making space for weekly personal updates, in addition to providing a framework for stand-ups and other work-related conversations. Watch the full recording to hear us answer audience questions like “Why not use FigJam instead of Freehand?”  by Eli WooleryEli is the Director of Design Education at InVision.
