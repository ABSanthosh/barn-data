  "text": "Written by E.M. Forster in 1909, thus over 100 years ago, the sci-fi short story The Machine Stops hit me hard in 2025. In an intriguingly prescient way, the author wrote about a future society in which humans live underground after ruining both biosphere and atmosphere of the planet. What is most interesting is that technological advancements rendered an above-all mechanical apparatus that permeates every aspect of human life. The story focuses then on the impacts on human behavior of deploying such a complex and ubiquitous sociotechnical system.The main character of the story is Vashti, a woman living in one of the underground cities of the southern hemisphere. Like everyone else in the world, Vashti lives in a \"small hexagonal\" room in which all her needs are met by the Machine. The room is empty of furniture, except for an armchair in the center, and by pressing a vast quantity of switches and buttons, its inhabitants can play music, trigger food dispensers, get connected and talk to friends, attend to and deliver lectures, control the lights of the ambient, and summon a bed when it's time to sleep. Most of her days are the same way: she wakes up, feds, delivers and listens to lectures, \"then she feds, talks to many friends, has a bath, talks again, and summons her bed\".",
