I presented the content decently enough, but something felt off.After the hour was up, the workshop facilitator sent out my feedback survey to the group.I’d been thoughtful and meticulous with my survey design. No leading questions. No ego strokes disguised as evaluation. No testimonial requests. Just clean, open-ended questions intended to elicit actual feedback.But I couldn’t bring myself to look at the responses right away. It was a classic post-presentation vulnerability hangover with a side of rejection sensitivity.Or, in pre-21st Century terms, I felt like shit and was scared the feedback would make me feel worse.While avoiding the truth, I stumbled onto this piece by Tim Denning about leaning into discomfort: You don’t need passion, you need to go to war.That snapped me right out of my procrasti-reading funk.I opened the survey responses.It was mostly good. Encouraging, actually. Except for this one:",
