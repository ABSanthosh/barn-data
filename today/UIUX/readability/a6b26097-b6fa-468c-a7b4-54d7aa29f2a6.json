  "text": "Duolingoâ€™s 6-step reactivation experienceItâ€™s not just about getting users back â€” itâ€™s about what happens next.I hadnâ€™t opened Duolingo in three months.But with a trip to Spain looming, I tapped the green owl â€” expecting the same experience as before.But something had changed.Instead of the normal homepage, I got a new reactivation experience: a cute sleeping owl, a check-in, personalised copy and a CRM series.Thereâ€™s two types of people in this world: those who can keep a duolingo streak and those who canâ€™t. Iâ€™m the latter.When I re-opened the app, I saw:A cute little â€˜welcome backâ€™ flowA check-in on where Iâ€™m at (including which language I want to learn â€” which was great, since I needed to switch from Italian to Spanish)An interesting push notifications strategyA personalised â€˜welcome backâ€™ emailThe reason this is so interesting to me is because lot of reactivation literature talks about how to get users back, not about what happens after that.Itâ€™s as if youâ€™re at one of those tourist restaurants: the waiter hard sells to get you in the door. Then, once youâ€™re sat down they take ages to serve you.Itâ€™s the same with reactivation.Many products invest in retargeting, offers, and churn flows but drop the ball on retention.Not Duolingo.With 300 million users and 7 billion exercises completed a month itâ€™s had its fair share of churn.But unlike most, Duolingo doesnâ€™t just work to get you back â€” it designs the experience to keep you there.Letâ€™s dive into how Duolingo turns reactivation into retention â€”starting with the 2025 welcome back flow which, interestingly, seems to have changed since 2024 ðŸ‘€Stage 1: Welcome back UXEight weeks before my Spain trip ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ I head back into Duolingo.",
