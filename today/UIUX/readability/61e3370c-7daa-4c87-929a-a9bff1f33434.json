  "text": "Free speech is a cornerstone of democracy. In the United States, it’s no coincidence that the First Amendment safeguards the freedom of expression and ideas.Unfortunately, free speech has become a contentious issue in our modern digital culture. The spread of misinformation and disinformation, particularly on social media platforms, has proven harmful and divisive.Even more dangerous is the effort by leaders, governments, and big tech to censor citizens on these platforms. This reactionary approach poses a significant threat to free speech and undermines the foundation of democracy.America, long recognized for supporting freedom of expression, is also known for its ability to solve complex problems. We’ve built and sustained one of the greatest nations in history — despite the pontifications of postmodernists and cultural critics. Our legacy includes pioneering technologies, leading social movements, and advancing medical innovation.But this pedigree means little if we cannot develop a solution to combat the spread of misinformation without infringing on the freedom that allows us to express ideas — good or bad.",
