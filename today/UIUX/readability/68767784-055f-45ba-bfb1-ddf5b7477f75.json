If not, no wonder. Hermès boutiques, tucked away inside old, beautiful hotels or grand historic buildings, look more like prisons than shops.In Madrid, for example, the store is inside a former hotel. But you won’t see anything in the windows. Why? Well, that’s because the cupboards (wardrobes?) with clothes are turned away from the windows, blocking the view:Why even have windows if you block them on purpose?Even more “relaxed” haute couture boutiques, like Balenciaga, have security guards at the doors and tall, frowning shop assistants glaring at customers from behind their screens. No wonder these stores are almost always empty:Balenciaga store in Barcelona",
