Either way, welcome. I’m glad you’re here.I want to open op your mind to building, launching, and growing your own digital products — whether you code or not, whether it’s a side project or something that grows into full-time work. Without waiting for permission, without endless planning, and without chasing someone else’s version of success. The focus here is on getting your hands dirty. I want you to start, create something tangible, and feel that rush of “Oh my god, I made this!” instead of getting stuck in the weeds of overthinking.This doesn’t have to be all or nothing — it can be a side project or your main thing, grow slow or fast. What matters is, it’s yours. You don’t need permission to start, and you can stop anytime. No rules, nothing to lose.",
