  "text": "Can we actually design for sustainability?4 strategies to improve a product’s eco-friendliness without losing usability.I have been bummed by the decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real (and scary), and this treaty committed countries to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And as an individual, it feels I can’t do anything to stop the harm being done to the planet.When you think of greenhouse gas emissions, you probably think of harsh manufacturing plants and how reliant we are on plastics (especially in the United States).But do you also think of “internet emissions?”I’ve always thought the digitization era was good for the environment with less physical waste and better resource management. But a lot goes into powering the internet and our digital products. Internet emissions are all-encompassing data centers, servers, devices, and power sources needed to load web-pages, store documents, or even check emails.I didn’t know how much the UX design industry contributes to internet emissions until I read Tom Greenwood’s Sustainable Web Design.UX designers want to create usable, efficient, and visually-appealing experiences so users continue to use our product more and more. But in reality, we’re just exacerbating the contributions to internet emissions. Our goals are not only to help users complete a task, but to get them to click more, consume more content, and spend more time in the product.This more, more, and more mindset is causing the average page weight to increase annually. According to the Web Almanac, the median page weight on desktop was 1080 KB in 2014, and increased to 2170 KB in 2022–over 100% increase in 8 years. A heavier page weight requires more data transfer, also requiring more energy to load.Web Almanac’s median page weight over time between 2014 to 2022We have a dilemma–do we continue to increase our engagement metrics for our products and intensify internet emissions? Or do we decrease engagement to lessen emissions, but lose our jobs?There are strategies all UX designers can use (other than just stopping UX design altogether) to improve a product’s eco-friendliness without losing usability–maintaining user engagement and keeping stakeholders happy. Let’s review these 4 strategies below, then look at real-world examples of these strategies being practiced.Climate change is happening, and the internet’s emissions heavily contribute to it. A lot goes into powering the internet, from data centers to our individual devices, but there is a large dependency on UX design that determines how sustainable (or not) a certain digital product is.Are the file formats efficient? Do videos and unnecessary content load automatically? Are users prompted to act more sustainably while using the product?All these questions can influence a product’s eco-friendliness without detracting its usability or visual appeal, but it’s up to UX designers to ensure it’s advocated for and implemented. By using strategies like designing for low data consumption and optimizing user journeys, products can reap the benefits of lowering their energy consumption and giving users faster and effective experiences.Instead of the standard more, more, and more approach found in UX design, let’s implement an intentional mindset to design for sustainability while maintaining an ideal experience for our users.If you haven’t read Tom Greenwood’s Sustainable Web Design, I highly recommend it!",
