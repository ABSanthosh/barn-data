  "text": "Summary:  Individuals at different career stages have different challenges, opportunities, and ways to level up. Growth in the UX field is complex. There are no universal career ladders, and comparing oneself to others is challenging due to the varied skills and tasks in the role. Instead of defining a single career path, this model of UX-career progression helps you reflect on your own personal journey. Like our UX-maturity model for organizations, this model allows you to assess where you are now and plan for where you want to grow. The UX-Career-Progression Model Stage 1: Novice Stage 2: Contributor Stage 3: Practitioner Stage 4: Specialist Stage 5: Visionary How to Self-Assess Conclusion The UX-Career-Progression Model Many UX professionals experience an overwhelming sense of ambiguity regarding career growth. This feeling was reflected in responses from our research on UX careers: “There aren't set steps… that can get me to the next level. It just kind of organically happened. So, it's unclear how I can get to the next point in my career.” “Career progression is very self-directed. There's no formal career ladder in the field.” This model is focused on career progression across the UX field rather than within individual organizations. Career progression within organizations is highly varied and dependent on many factors, including: Organizational hierarchy: In organizations with a flat hierarchy, employees often have less room for growth due to few hierarchical levels. UX maturity: Organizations with low UX maturity tend to offer few growth opportunities, as the value and integration of UX practices are still developing. Specialization of the role: Highly specialized roles can limit perceived career growth, as the pathway for growth becomes narrower and more defined by niche experience. This career-progression model provides a flexible framework to understand and navigate your career path, regardless of organizational context or specific job title. It’s possible to fall into one stage in terms of expertise and contributions, but hold a job title that implies a different stage (such as being at the specialist stage but holding a contributor-level job title like UX designer, for example). By focusing on skills, impact, and contributions rather than job title alone, this model also helps practitioners across various specializations (writing, UI design, development, and so on). The 5 Stages of UX Career Progression Novice: New to UX with little or no formal UX training or practical experience Contributor: Early-career UX practitioners developing an understanding of UX principles and contributing to projects with direct supervision Practitioner: UX professionals who can complete projects independently and know when to apply different UX principles Specialist: Skilled practitioners known for their deep UX expertise in particular areas of UX and can influence strategy on their team(s) Visionary: UX practitioners who have made significant contributions to the UX community and industry practices Factors in UX-Career Progression Our research with UX practitioners indicates that growing to the next stage in your UX career can be done in a variety of ways, including: Gaining skills in your practice Being recognized by team members as an expert Taking on strategic responsibilities Gaining trust or freedom from leadership Increasing self-confidence in your work Stage 1: Novice A novice is brand-new to the field with little to no formal training or practical experience. At this stage, people show interest in the field and learn the basics by reading articles or books, watching relevant videos, or attending conference talks. Typical novices include students, recent graduates, and career transitioners. One survey respondent shared her experience learning on the job: “I had to find my own way... I would be handed research projects and pretty much teach myself how to do the research on that thing. I slowly went from research helper to a requested resource.” Common Obstacles to Overcome Applying theory to real-world scenarios: Novices often struggle to translate theoretical knowledge into practical applications. Understanding user needs: Without practical experience, grasping the true needs and behaviors of users can be difficult. Collaborating with others: Presenting ideas confidently and working effectively within a team or with stakeholders requires practice and guidance. How to Level Up Work on small projects: Engage in small-scale projects to grasp the design or research process in real-life scenarios. Seek out a mentor: Find a mentor in the industry to provide support and resources. Take a wide variety of courses: Enroll in training courses that cover various areas of UX to help broaden your skills and knowledge of the field. Stage 2: Contributor A contributor is an early-career practitioner who understands UX principles and can contribute to projects under direct supervision. While early-career practitioners are not solely defined by their years of experience, respondents at the contributor stage typically had 1–3 years in the field. At this stage, UX professionals may work in teams to deliver designs or research findings and receive frequent feedback from team leads or managers. This stage typically includes junior-level practitioners, associates, assistants, and interns. While interns may produce less output than full-time junior-level staff, they typically work under close supervision in similar ways. An interview participant at this stage described his level of self-confidence: “Now that I'm doing it on a more consistent basis, I'm finding that I still need to learn a lot in order to feel like [I’m] fully comfortable in terms of taking on a new project or something that I'm unfamiliar with and running with it.” Common Obstacles to Overcome Time management and prioritizing tasks: Contributors often struggle with managing their time effectively and prioritizing tasks on projects. Managing and implementing feedback: Integrating feedback from team leads, managers, and stakeholders often includes multiple iterations. Communicating with stakeholders and leadership: Contributors are still gaining confidence in their communication skills and may feel pressured to incorporate feedback that doesn’t serve users. How to Level Up Actively seek targeted feedback: Request specific, actionable feedback from team leads or managers on particular aspects of your work, such as research techniques or design elements. Collaborate closely with teammates: Learn from your teammates' presentations and working styles and apply what you learn to your own work. Pursue specialized training: Enroll in courses that focus on specific areas of the design or research process to deepen your expertise. Stage 3: Practitioner A practitioner is an experienced UX professional who can complete projects independently and identify when and how to apply different UX methods. Practitioners may work independently or in teams to deliver designs or research findings and can easily apply stakeholder feedback to their projects. This stage typically includes mid-level UX professionals with a few years of experience. An interview participant recalled his increasing self-confidence in meetings with stakeholders: “I feel more comfortable sitting in on stakeholder meetings. I see myself participating more in calls with five or six different people. I feel more comfortable… pushing back on a stakeholder’s recommendation because I, from a research perspective, know that that might not be the best way to go.” In addition, a career transitioner survey respondent discussed how she makes use of her existing skills: “It starts with learning how to translate your previous skills and experiences into the new UX field, then experimenting with different projects and methods to find out how they work, and eventually moving into a more confident stage where you can still experiment, methodologically speaking, but you do so more thoughtfully.” Common Obstacles to Overcome Balancing user needs with business needs: Practitioners must navigate the conflicting requirements of user and business goals, which can happen frequently in projects with many stakeholders. Understanding technical constraints: Recognizing and working within the technical limitations of design and research requires practitioners to get creative in their methods. Identifying overarching themes of research: Synthesizing research findings and stakeholder feedback into broader themes can be challenging and time-consuming. Inflexibility of your design or research process: Being too rigid in your process can stifle creativity and the ability to adapt your methods. How to Level Up Lead a project: Take the lead on a project to help build leadership skills and demonstrate your ability to manage complex tasks. Deepen your expertise in a specific topic: Focus on becoming an expert in a particular area of UX, such as qualitative research, visual design, or content strategy. Tailor your process: Customize your research or design process to fit the specific needs of each project, to become comfortable adapting methods. Stage 4: Specialist Specialists have deep competency in a particular area of their UX process and can influence their teams’ UX strategy. At this stage, UX professionals are considered experts and UX resources. Specialists are typically mid- to senior-level practitioners with a niche focus or subject-matter expertise. An interview participant described how she differentiates among various roles and responsibilities at this stage: “[W]hat I've discovered is [that] a lead is leading projects and initiatives, but maybe not managing people. And I think a principal is more of that, taking on more junior level people under you and also taking lead of projects and big initiatives.” Another interview participant recognized the turning point of progressing from a practitioner to a specialist: “If it feels like I have a seat at the table for strategy;  […] I know that there was a point when I didn't, and… I was very much just executing on someone else's idea.” Common Obstacles to Overcome Broadening skills beyond specialty: Specialists may find it challenging to expand their skill set beyond their niche because they do less generalized work. Understanding obstacles from other career-progression stages: Recognizing and appreciating the struggles faced by practitioners at other career stages make it difficult to give actionable advice and be a helpful mentor. How to Level Up Mentor other UX professionals: Provide guidance and support to less experienced practitioners to build leadership skills and contribute to the UX community. Educate others in the UX community: Share your knowledge through articles, meetups, and conferences. Explore skills outside of your specialty: Diversify your expertise by learning skills outside of your current niche or focus area. Stage 5: Visionary Visionaries have made significant contributions to the UX community at large and help shape the future of UX. At this stage, they are considered experts by the UX community and influence UX processes, methods, and thinking across organizations. Visionaries are often authors, conference speakers, and influential practitioners in the field. Common Obstacles to Overcome Maintaining relevance: Keeping up with the ever changing advancements in UX requires seeking out new methods, advice, and case studies. Avoiding burnout: Finding new places to get your message out and consistently preaching the same message can be time-consuming and feel repetitive. How to Level Up Collaborate with others: Engage in collaborative projects with other practitioners to expand your knowledge and apply concepts in new ways. Continue learning: Stay current with new trends, tools, and methodologies to maintain your expertise and influence. Apply practices in new ways: Experiment with your existing practices and adapt them to new contexts, pushing the boundaries of those practices further. How to Self-Assess Assessing your career progression can be challenging due to the UX field’s broad and diverse nature. There is no one-size-fits-all framework, and the varied skills and backgrounds of UX practitioners add to the complexity of assessment. While this flexibility allows for a multitude of career paths, it can also be frustrating and confusing when evaluating your progress. Here are some steps to help you self-assess and navigate your career growth: Brainstorm your personal attributes of growth: Reflect on your recent projects, struggles, and accomplishments. Consider both “hard skills” (knowledge of tools, research methods, and so on) and “soft skills” (communication, storytelling, problem solving, and so on). Conduct a career-focused SWOT retrospective: Perform a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis focused on your career. Identify your strengths and weaknesses, brainstorm growth opportunities, and recognize potential threats to your progression. This analysis can provide a picture of where you are now and what steps you need to take to level up. Seek feedback from others: Solicit feedback from colleagues, managers, and mentors. Their perspectives will offer valuable insights and potentially constructive feedback to help guide your opportunities for growth. Set goals and align new opportunities to them: Define clear, achievable goals and create a plan to reach them. Align new opportunities with these goals to ensure that each step you take moves you closer to your intended path. Review and adjust your goals regularly (perhaps quarterly or yearly) as you progress and the field changes. Conclusion Career progression is not always linear and can be drawn out over long periods of time. It requires proactive effort and continuous learning. One survey respondent summed up her thoughts on career progression: “Constantly working to learn and grow as an individual while consistently supporting and elevating those around you. Progression is not just skill-based, but knowledge, experience, and responsibilities all play a role. As long as an individual is bettering themselves professionally and are motivated to never stop learning and advancing, then their potential for progress is limitless.” Understanding which stage you’re at now helps you figure out what is needed to grow into the next stage and provides you with the ability to recognize typical challenges that you might be facing.",
