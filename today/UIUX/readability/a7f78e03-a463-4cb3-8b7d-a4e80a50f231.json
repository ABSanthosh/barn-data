  "text": "On Nov 19, 2022 at 4:28 AM Elon Musk tweeted that he was leaving a late night code review session at Twitter HQ with photos to prove it. When our engineering team here at InVision saw this, right away we started to wonder, could that meeting have been run with a Freehand? If it was, it would have ensured inclusivity regardless of whether people are in or out of the office, whether they’re collaborating sync or async, and it would keep a record so nothing is ever lost. That way you wouldn’t need to remember to snap a picture before someone erases the board. So we did just that. Here is Twitter’s systems architecture diagram in a Freehand! If you’re an engineer looking for a better way to create your next systems architecture diagram (or really anything visual for that matter), InVision Freehand is built just for you. We’ve even got developer templates to get you started! Freehand templates from industry leadersImprove team collaboration with a collection of templates for brainstorming, customer journey maps, design sprints, and more.
