Jump to table of contents.Left-Handedness ≠ “Left-Only”It’s easy to assume that left-handed people are usually left-handed users. However, that’s not necessarily the case. Because most products are designed with right-handed use in mind, many left-handed people have to use their right hand to navigate the physical world.From very early childhood, left-handed people have to rely on their right hand to use tools and appliances like scissors, openers, fridges, and so on. That’s why left-handed people tend to be ambidextrous, sometimes using different hands for different tasks, and sometimes using different hands for the same tasks interchangeably. However, only 1% of people use both hands equally well (ambidextrous).Challenges for left-handed people: when a foldable desk for writing is located on the right. Better: pull it up to the center. (Large preview)In the same way, right-handed people aren’t necessarily right-handed users. It’s common to be using a mobile device in both left and right hands, or both, perhaps with a preference for one. But when it comes to writing, a preference is stronger.Challenges For Left-Handed UsersBecause left-handed users are in the minority, there is less demand for left-handed products, and so typically they are more expensive, and also more difficult to find. Troubles often emerge with seemingly simple tools — scissors, can openers, musical instruments, rulers, microwaves and bank pens.Challenges for left-handed people: using “regular” scissors with the left hand can be difficult for left-handed users. (Large preview)For example, most scissors are designed with the top blade positioned for right-handed use, which makes cutting difficult and less precise. And in microwaves, buttons and interfaces are nearly always on the right, making left-handed use more difficult.Now, with digital products, most left-handed people tend to adapt to right-handed tools, which they use daily. Unsurprisingly, many use their right hand to navigate the mouse. However, it’s often quite different on mobile where the left hand is often preferred.Don’t make design decisions based on left/right-handedness.Allow customizations based on the user’s personal preferences.Allow users to re-order columns (incl. the Actions column).In forms, place action buttons next to the last user’s interaction.Keyboard accessibility helps everyone move faster (Esc).Usability Guidelines To Support Both HandsAs Ruben Babu writes, we shouldn’t design a fire extinguisher that can’t be used by both hands. Think pull up and pull down, rather than swipe left or right. Minimize the distance to travel with the mouse. And when in doubt, align to the center.Bottom left → better for lefties, bottom right → for righties.With magnifiers, users can’t spot right-aligned buttons.On desktop, align buttons to the left/middle, not right.On mobile, most people switch both hands when tapping.Key actions → put in middle half to two-thirds of the screen.Opposite-Handed UX test can be helpful to test how good the UI is — also known as “left-handed oil test” for physical products. (Large preview)A simple way to test the mobile UI is by trying to use the opposite-handed UX test. For key flows, we try to complete them with your non-dominant hand and use the opposite hand to discover UX shortcomings.For physical products, you might try the oil test. It might be more effective than you might think.Good UX Works For BothOur aim isn’t to degrade the UX of right-handed users by meeting the needs of left-handed users. The aim is to create an accessible experience for everyone. Providing a better experience for left-handed people also benefits right-handed people who have a temporary arm disability.And that’s an often-repeated but also often-overlooked universal principle of usability: better accessibility is better for everyone, even if it might feel that it doesn’t benefit you directly at the moment.Useful Resources“Discover Hidden UX Flaws With the Opposite-Handed UX Test,” by Jeff Huang“Right-Aligned Buttons Aren’t More Efficient For Right-Handed People,” by Julia Y.“Mobile Accessibility Target Sizes Cheatsheet,” by Vitaly Friedman“Why The World Is Not Designed For Left-Handed People,” by Elvis Hsiao“Usability For Left Handedness 101”, by Ruben BabuTouch Design For Mobile Interfaces, by Steven HooberMeet “Smart Interface Design Patterns”You can find more details on design patterns and UX in Smart Interface Design Patterns, our 15h-video course with 100s of practical examples from real-life projects — with a live UX training later this year.
