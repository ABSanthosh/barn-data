Williams takes us for a deep dive into the real world of UX research, with a roadmap for including users with different abilities and needs. Purchase now to get your copy as soon as it’s available, and to save off the full price. Pre-order the book.UX research can take so much of the guesswork out of the design process! But it’s easy to forget just how different people are and how their needs and preferences can vary. We can’t predict the needs of every user, but we shouldn’t expect different people using the product in roughly the same way. That’s how we end up with an incomplete, inaccurate, or simply wrong picture of our customers.There is no shortage of accessibility checklists and guidelines. But accessibility isn’t a checklist. It doesn’t happen by accident. It’s a dedicated effort to include and consider and understand different needs of different users to make sure everyone can use our products successfully. That’s why we’ve teamed up with Michele A. Williams on a shiny new book around just that.Meet Accessible UX Research, your guide to making UX research more inclusive of participants with different needs — from planning and recruiting to facilitation, asking better questions, avoiding bias, and building trust. Pre-order the book.About The BookThe book isn’t a checklist for you to complete as a part of your accessibility work. It’s a practical guide to inclusive UX research, from start to finish. If you’ve ever felt unsure how to include disabled participants, or worried about “getting it wrong,” this book is for you. You’ll get clear, practical strategies to make your research more inclusive, effective, and reliable.Inside, you’ll learn how to:Plan research that includes disabled participants from the start,Recruit participants with disabilities,Facilitate sessions that work for a range of access needs,Ask better questions and avoid unintentionally biased research methods,Build trust and confidence in your team around accessibility and inclusion.The book also challenges common assumptions about disability and urges readers to rethink what inclusion really means in UX research and beyond. Let’s move beyond compliance and start doing research that reflects the full diversity of your users. Whether you’re in industry or academia, this book gives you the tools — and the mindset — to make it happen.High-quality hardcover. Written by Dr. Michele A. Williams. Cover art by Espen Brunborg. Print shipping in August 2025. eBook available for download later this summer. Pre-order the book.ContentsDisability mindset: For inclusive research to succeed, we must first confront our mindset about disability, typically influenced by ableism.Diversity of disability: Accessibility is not solely about blind screen reader users; disability categories help us unpack and process the diversity of disabled users.Disability in the stages of UX research: Disabled participants can and should be part of every research phase — formative, prototype, and summative.Recruiting disabled participants: Recruiting disabled participants is not always easy, but that simply means we need to learn strategies on where to look.Designing your research: While our goal is to influence accessible products, our research execution must also be accessible.Facilitating an accessible study: Preparation and communication with your participants can ensure your study logistics run smoothly.Analyzing and reporting with accuracy and impact: How you communicate your findings is just as important as gathering them in the first place — so prepare to be a storyteller, educator, and advocate.Disability in the UX research field: Inclusion isn’t just for research participants, it’s important for our colleagues as well, as explained by blind UX Researcher Dr. Cynthia Bennett.Who This Book Is ForWhether a UX professional who conducts research in industry or academia, or more broadly part of an engineering, product, or design function, you’ll want to read this book if…You have been tasked to improve accessibility of your product, but need to know where to start to facilitate this successfully.You want to establish a culture for accessibility in your company, but not sure how to make it work.You want to move from WCAG/EAA compliance to established accessibility practices and inclusion in research practices and beyond.You want to improve your overall accessibility knowledge and be viewed as an Accessibility Specialist for your organization.About the AuthorDr. Michele A.

In addressing disability at the User Experience Research layer, it helps to set an equal and equitable tone for products and features that resonates through the rest of the creation process. The book provides a solid framework for all aspects of conducting research efforts, including not only process considerations, but also importantly the mindset required to approach the work.This is the book I wish I had when I was first getting started with my accessibility journey. It is a gift, and I feel so fortunate that Michele has chosen to share it with us all.”Eric Bailey, Accessibility Advocate“User research in accessibility is non-negotiable for actually meeting users’ needs, and this book is a critical piece in the puzzle of actually doing and integrating that research into accessibility work day to day.”Devon Pershing, Author of The Accessibility Operations Guidebook“Our decisions as developers and designers are often based on recommendations, assumptions, and biases. Usually, this doesn’t work, because checking off lists or working solely from our own perspective can never truly represent the depth of human experience. Michele’s book provides you with the strategies you need to conduct UX research with diverse groups of people, challenge your assumptions, and create truly great products.”Manuel Matuzović, Author of the Web Accessibility Cookbook“This book is a vital resource on inclusive research. Michele Williams expertly breaks down key concepts, guiding readers through disability models, language, and etiquette. A strong focus on real-world application equips readers to conduct impactful, inclusive research sessions. By emphasizing diverse perspectives and proactive inclusion, the book makes a compelling case for accessibility as a core principle rather than an afterthought.
