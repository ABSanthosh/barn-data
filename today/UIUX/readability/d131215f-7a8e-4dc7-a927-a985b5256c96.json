  "text": "Simple steps to improve usability for all generations.Prompt: A contemporary collage featuring diverse older adults interacting with oversized UI elements, bold typography, and playful shapes that represent easy-to-use tech, modern, abstract, colorful, editorial styleWe’re experiencing a global demographic shift. By 2030, 1 in 6 people worldwide will be 60 years or older, and by 2050, that number will double to 2.1 billion — with 80% of older adults living in low- and middle-income countries. (Source: WHO)In 2020, for the first time, people aged 60+ outnumbered children under 5. This rapid pace of population aging means we — designers, developers, product managers — must be ready to serve a demographic with unique needs.Chart representing how quickly the world’s population is rising.The good news? Designing for people with age-related challenges almost always improves the usability for everyone. Many issues that older users face — like reduced vision, hearing difficulties, or limited mobility — are similar to what anyone might experience in less-than-ideal conditions, such as trying to use a device in bright sunlight, a noisy restaurant, or while holding a baby. In other words, good accessibility is good design. By prioritizing inclusive features, you create products that are more intuitive and user-friendly for all.When we designed Loud + Clear, a fitness app for people with Parkinson’s, we tried to build something from the ground up with these philosophies in mind.A few highlights from the Loud + Clear app, a fitness app we designed for people with Parkinson’s. Available in the Apple and Google App Stores.Things to keep in mindHere are some reminders about how our minds and bodies evolve as we get older:VisionAs people age, the lens of the eye hardens, making it harder to focus on close objects (a condition called presbyopia). This can make it difficult to see small text, low-contrast colors, and complex layouts. Tiny text is a frequent complaint, especially given that the average 60-year-old needs three times as much light as a 20-year-old to perceive the same brightness. Using larger font sizes, high-contrast colors, and simple layouts can make a huge difference.In Loud + Clear, for instance, we used Atkinson’s Hyperlegible, a free font developed by The Braille Institute to specifically help low-vision readers. We also test different zoom levels to ensure legibility.Brochure for the Braille Institue using the font Atkinson’s HyperlegibleMotor ControlJoint and neurological changes over time can reduce dexterity, reinforcing the need for careful interface design. Older adults can find touchscreens and trackpads difficult if elements are too small or tightly spaced. Larger buttons and generous spacing help avoid accidental taps. Consider alternative input methods, such as keyboard navigation or voice commands, so users aren’t forced to rely solely on pinpoint finger accuracy.With Loud + Clear, we gave every affordance we could, including maximizing every tappable element in size, including buttons, inputs, and links, while still providing space.HearingStudies show that as hair cells in the inner ear degrade, it becomes harder to distinguish speech from background noise. This condition, known as presbycusis, is common with aging and often makes hearing high-frequency sounds more difficult. Captions and transcripts on videos or audio content are essential. Don’t rely on sound alone to convey important information — keep visual cues clear and easy to spot.With Loud + Clear, we prioritized creating the most accessible instructional videos possible. Videos autoplay with captions enabled by default, ensuring that key information is immediately visible without relying on sound. Users can choose to unmute if they prefer to hear the audio, but starting with captions ensures no one is excluded. This opt-in approach makes it easier for everyone — especially those with hearing challenges — to engage with the content in a way that works best for them.CognitionWith age, attention spans, memory, and processing speed may shift. Research indicates that in healthy older adults, the brain simply processes information more slowly, making clear and simple interfaces essential.Keep it simple: use plain language, short sentences, and provide clear feedback after each action. Avoid swamping users with too many steps at once, and let them move at their own pace.At Loud + Clear, we addressed this by breaking exercises into small, manageable steps, using plain language, and providing clear, immediate feedback at every stage. Progress indicators and simple instructions help users stay focused and confident without feeling overwhelmed. By allowing users to move at their own pace, we ensure the experience remains approachable and stress-free.Data SecurityOlder adults can be more cautious and less tech-savvy about online privacy. Make it easy to manage their privacy and security settings, and be transparent about how user data is collected and used. If there’s a data breach or other issue, tell them — older users appreciate honesty and want to feel safe online.At Loud + Clear, we take a minimalist approach to data collection. We only collect email addresses, which are used solely to save user progress. By limiting data collection to the essentials, we reduce privacy concerns and build trust with our users, ensuring they feel secure and in control of their information.ExperienceNever assume older adults are clueless with tech. Many are quite experienced; others may be starting fresh. Provide clear instructions and tutorials to avoid confusion. Keep jargon to a minimum, and let users see how things work step-by-step. By respecting different skill levels, you welcome everyone.In Loud + Clear, we included simple tutorials along the way but gave users the option to skip if they felt confident navigating independently. We also added a prominent Help option so users could reach out quickly with questions or suggestions, reducing frustration and confusion.Don’t forget to make it funIt seems everyone enjoys mobile gaming now, and older audiences are no exception. Adding small gamification elements, like progress badges, daily streaks, or fun challenges, can spark intrinsic motivation and keep people coming back. But gamifying for older audiences requires a bit of finesse:Keep It Simple: Avoid overwhelming users with overly complex game mechanics or cluttered interfaces. A clear, straightforward system often works best.Tie It to Their Goals: Show how these features support health, social connections, or other meaningful benefits. If your app tracks physical therapy exercises, for example, celebrate daily progress with a gentle badge or milestone tracker.Respect Their Pace: Some older adults may love a little friendly competition, while others prefer a relaxed approach. Make sure leaderboards or timers are optional, so nobody feels forced into a fast-paced environment.At Loud + Clear, we tried to gamify small things at first, like the voice warmup, to test the waters. Badges, achievements, icons, were intentionally made very large and as clear as possible. We also made a rule to always include a label with the icon for clarity.How We Test: Simulating Real-World ChallengesDesigning for older adults works best when you test with people who actually face these challenges — or at least simulate those conditions if live user testing isn’t immediately available. Here’s what we do:VisualEyes Vision Simulator GlassesWe keep a set of seven simulator glasses on hand. Each pair demonstrates a different type of vision loss. They help us understand the everyday experiences of users with various impairments:Combination Loss (CMV Retinitis): Simulates floaters and spotty vision.Central Field Loss (Macular Degeneration): Reduces clarity at the center of vision, measured with an Amsler Grid.Peripheral Loss: Mimics conditions like retinitis pigmentosa or advanced glaucoma.Overall Blur (Cataracts/Corneal Issues): Shows how clouded lenses affect clarity.Hemifield/Hemianopsia: Simulates the vision impairment that may result from stroke or brain injury.Low Contrast Charts: Demonstrates the reduced detail, color, and sharpness older adults often experience.Color Simulator: Imitates the dulled or yellowed color perception from a maturing cataract.Trying on these glasses reminds us just how tough it can be to see small text, low-contrast elements, or detailed icons. This tangible experience helps us design more empathetically.Funkify Chrome ExtensionFor further testing, we use the Funkify Chrome extension to simulate vision impairments and other challenges in a digital environment. Funkify can blur or warp the on-screen content, shift colors, or add visual noise — giving us another perspective on how older adults or users with low vision might see our interfaces.Key Features:Cognition Simulator: Simulates the experiences of users with autism, ADHD, or other neurological conditions. It slows and fragments interactions, helping us understand how to design clearer, less overwhelming interfaces.Dyslexia Simulator: Scrambles and “dances” the text on screen, recreating the frustration dyslexic users might face. This helps us prioritize readable fonts like Atkinson Hyperlegible and design with text clarity in mind.Motor Simulator: The persona “Trembling Trevor” mimics conditions that affect motor control, such as Parkinson’s or tremors, by making the mouse pointer harder to control. This highlights the importance of large, well-spaced buttons and alternative input methods like keyboard navigation.Vision Simulator: Offers several filters that emulate visual impairments such as low contrast, blurred vision, or color blindness. This allows us to refine layouts, test color contrast ratios, and improve the visual accessibility of our designs.At Loud + Clear, Funkify plays a critical role in testing. It helps us identify and resolve design barriers for users with low vision, motor impairments, cognitive differences, and more. For example, we used the motor simulator to ensure our large buttons are easy to click, even for those with limited dexterity. By integrating tools like Funkify into our design process, we make accessibility improvements that benefit not just older adults or those with disabilities, but anyone navigating less-than-ideal conditions.Observing and Taking Notes (HMW Format)We then ask participants — or team members wearing the glasses or using Funkify — to navigate the app or website we’re testing. As they go, we encourage them to note:What’s challenging?Why is it challenging?How might we (HMW) fix or improve it?The HMW (How Might We…) approach frames feedback as opportunities rather than just problems. For example, if a button is too small, we’d write: “HMW make the ‘Next’ button easier to tap with blurry vision?”By gathering feedback this way, we build a list of actionable improvements. Whether it’s increasing font size, boosting color contrast, or simplifying navigation, each item on our list comes directly from these testing sessions.Testing with our team using the VisualEyes Vision Simulator GlassesA Checklist for Age-Inclusive DesignVision ImpairmentUse larger text: Remember the average 60-year-old needs 3x more light than a 20-year-old.Adopt a legible font: For example, Atkinson Hyperlegible, developed by The Braille Institute.Check color contrast: Aim for high contrast ratios and test at different zoom levels.Simplify layouts: Reduce clutter so important info stands out.Let people adjust text size: Offer in-app or system-level options so users can enlarge fonts to a comfortable level.Always test using screen readers: This ensures visually impaired users can navigate and understand your content without friction.Motor Skill ImpairmentLarger buttons \u0026 spacing: Prevent accidental taps by giving users enough room.Offer alternative inputs: Keyboard navigation or voice commands can be easier for those with limited dexterity.Avoid tiny touch targets: Ensure tap zones are big enough for tremors or unsteady hands.Hearing ImpairmentAlways include captions or transcripts for videos and audio.Use visual cues for alerts or notifications — don’t rely solely on sound.Keep audio optional: Provide volume controls or muting options if possible.Provide multiple contact options: In addition to phone calls, offer email, live chat, or in-app messaging for those who prefer text-based communication.Cognitive ImpairmentPlain language \u0026 short steps: Break tasks into smaller chunks and avoid jargon.Provide shortcuts: Offer quick paths or autofill features so users can skip repetitive actions.Use multiple cues: Combine color, shapes, and text to clarify meaning — don’t rely on just one element.Save user progress: Allow them to pause and return without losing their work, so they don’t feel rushed.Give clear feedback on progress: During longer tasks, show users where they are, what’s left, and remind them of the goal.Data SecuritySimple, transparent privacy settings: Make it easy for older adults to know what data they’re sharing.Honest communication: If there’s a breach or security issue, tell users promptly and offer solutions.Build trust: Many older adults rely on digital products for health and independence, so clarity and honesty are critical.Experience (Respect All Skill Levels)Provide tutorials and guidance: Cater to different familiarity levels — some older adults are tech-savvy, others are new.Minimize jargon: Explain terms and avoid acronyms.Clear labeling: Include text labels with icons, especially if you’re using large or decorative icons.Gamification \u0026 FunKeep it simple: Use progress badges or daily streaks without complex game mechanics.Tie it to user goals: Show how these features support health, learning, or social connections.Respect user pace: Make leaderboards or timers optional. Some enjoy light competition; others prefer a relaxed approach.Real-World TestingTest with Older Adults: Recruit real users in your target age group; don’t rely on guesswork.Simulate Vision Impairments: Use VisualEyes glasses or the Funkify Chrome extension to see how low vision or blurry vision affects your app.Use HMW Notes: Ask, “How might we improve this?” to frame issues as opportunities.Iterate Quickly: Small tweaks (like bigger fonts or higher contrast) can make a huge difference.Looking AheadOur world is shifting, and so are the people who use our products. As populations age, embracing inclusive design is no longer optional — it’s the way forward. The more we adapt to changing needs, the more we reduce frustration and build real trust. Keep accessibility in your process from day one, and watch your product evolve into a tool people of all ages can rely on.More ResourcesMy Team’s Original Presentation for Accessibility Day 2018The Original Checklist: Designing for Older Audiences (PDF)Accessibility Posters (PDF)Vision Impairment Glasses ($30)Funkify — Chrome ExtensionContrast Ratio Testing ToolA11y ProjectUdacity Web Accessibility CourseInclusive Design ChecklistIf you’re interested in working with me, please reach out.
