Legal did legal things.But recently, I became aware of how important it is for designers to understand new compliance regulations. I was asked by a client in a heavily regulated space about UX best practices that support their compliance. I muttered something about attorneys. Then, something about it being a platform issue. And I walked away knowing I needed to understand this better.That moment reframed things for me. Now, with privacy laws like California’s CCPA and CPRA enforcing user consent, opt-out links, and even banning manipulative UX patterns (aka “dark patterns”), not understanding compliance is a liability.
