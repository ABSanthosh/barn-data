It takes years of training, practice, and self-learning to become a designer.Ceiling: There’s a limit on how good you can be at designing and influencing a product — even the best designers often struggle to bring their ideas to life without engineering help.The Ceiling and Floor in product design — by Noah Levin (Source).Noah then predicted the role of AI in design is to shift both the floor and the ceiling. It’s lowering the floor — allowing more people to create, prototype, and ship ideas faster than ever. And it’s raising the ceiling — giving designers superpowers to develop, iterate, and push the limits of creativity.",
