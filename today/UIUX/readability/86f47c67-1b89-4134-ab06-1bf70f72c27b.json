While sustainability often evokes ideas of a ‘green world’, it also involves strategically organising workflows in tech companies. This approach not only conserves resources but also saves time and effort, enabling us to focus on meaningful tasks rather than repetitive work — an unsustainable practice in tech.The more sustainable practices we integrate into our routines, the less repetitive work we encounter. This isn’t just a responsible approach – it’s also an enjoyable one. In this article, we won’t dwell on sustainability issues but instead will present content design practices with actionable steps anyone can take to foster sustainability within their organisation, boosting both efficiency and long-term impact.By putting in the effort to build a sustainable environment now, we can create lasting results for years to come, ensuring we leave a positive legacy. Ultimately, sustainability in tech supports both a greener planet and a more efficient, rewarding work experience.Content design as a tool for sustainabilityAs a content designer, I encounter opportunities for sustainability improvements daily – from simple resources like glossaries to restructured sustainable design workflows and collaboration methods at the organisational level.Content, as a tool for answering a user need, is everywhere, and it can be crafted poorly or efficiently. What excites me is how straightforward it can be to create effective content – though knowing where to begin can sometimes be challenging. This is why I’ve created this guide: to provide clear starting points for fostering sustainability in your organisation through content design.By following these principles, you can reduce unnecessary documentation, create concise yet informative content for external as well as internal use, and leverage templates and ready-to-use solutions. While some aspects of content are unique to specific companies or tools, this article outlines universal practices that require no specialised tools. You can start reshaping your sustainability impact via content as soon as you finish reading.Three content design practices for sustainable communicationAmong the best content design practices, three core, widely applicable principles can enhance sustainability in any tech workflow: writing in clear language (also known as ‘plain language’), structuring content effectively, and creating reusable content.Clear languageClear language ensures that even complex ideas are easy to understand. Many governments, such as Australia’s, promote these principles to improve accessibility.Key guidelines include:Use everyday words.Avoid jargon or latin expressions, acronyms, initialisms and abbreviations.Use inclusive language.Learn the words your audience uses.Choose simple words over complex expressions.Limit terms with specialised meanings.These principles align with readability standards, like those by Jakob Nielsen. Clear language improves comprehension for all readers, including those learning the language. Aim for a reading level equivalent to GCSE or A-levels (10 – 12th grade), ensuring clarity for a broad audience.Clear language applies to writing and speaking, so consider borrowing from your natural spoken style for clearer written content.Structured contentOnce ideas are expressed in clear language, structuring content becomes essential. Proper structure allows readers to scan information and complete their tasks quicker and with less energy waste, saving time on reading, understanding, and recalling content. Well-structured information is also easier to remember and visually process.To make content accessible and easily digestible, follow these guidelines:Use meaningful titles that summarise the section’s main idea.Be succinct and remove unnecessary words and phrases.Ensure relevance: if a sentence or phrase doesn’t contribute essential information, remove it.Keep it brief: focus on one main message at a time and avoid unnecessary punctuation.Use a logical hierarchy: in English, this typically means placing content from top to bottom, left to right (e.g., legal text should appear before, not after, a button).Add clear calls to action.Use bullet or numbered lists wherever possible.These steps make content accessible and assist people in achieving their goals, promoting better UX and supporting sustainability. When content is well-structured and clear, users are less likely to repeat tasks, reducing inefficiency. UX patterns that frustrate users or lead to misclicks increase energy use without adding value.Reusable contentOnce content is clear and well-structured, reusability becomes the next step. Reusable content involves creating standardised components that can be used across different contexts.Reusable content benefits all user-facing communications, from product descriptions to onboarding flows and support chat. For instance, product descriptions might be presented in the form of a short text, titles and subtitles, or detailed instructions – all used at different stages of the user journey. Consistent access to reusable content helps every team stay aligned.Different companies manage reusable content in various ways:Content Management Systems (CMS) help international teams manage translations and maintain consistency across languages.DITA XML is widely used in technical documentation to create and manage reusable content.Integrated content design system or content standards work best when embedded within the product design system.Product glossaries (spreadsheets like Excel files uploaded to a CMS) help maintain consistent terminology.Having a single, reliable source of truth for content prevents teams from creating duplicate material and supports a sustainable workflow – a key content design approach that benefits tech companies overall.Business benefits of a sustainable environmentSustainability initiatives, when done well, directly impact costs. Without it, companies often waste resources. Clear language and structured content help teams spend less time reading and comprehending, while reusable content allows teams to access existing resources, reducing repetitive work.Let’s estimate the savings from implementing sustainable practices. Imagine only 25% of a company’s 1,000 employees benefit from implementing these three content design principles, saving each of these 250 employees two hours per week. Assuming an average hourly rate of $45: 250 employees x 2 hours per week x 50 weeks x $45/hour = $1,125,000 savings per year total.This rough calculation shows the substantial savings sustainable content design practices can offer a company of 1000 employees.Implementing sustainable content design practices in techThese core content design practices – clear language, structured content, and reusability – are initially intended to streamline workflows within content teams in a tech company. They enhance collaboration, alignment, and productivity, helping content designers develop consistent guidelines and tone of voice, especially valuable for emerging teams. However, content isn’t solely the responsibility of content designers – it extends throughout UX and beyond, impacting all areas of an organisation.How to use this guide1. Identify the type of communication you manage or contribute to within your company.2. Review the three content design principles applied to that type of communication, and explore how you can foster a sustainable approach.3. Start with a practical example to make your initial steps towards sustainability.4. Share your approach with other teams to strengthen your company’s overall sustainability efforts. Using a RACI chart can support this initiative by defining roles and responsibilities within content projects.External communicationsExternal communications extend to various teams within the organisation. Product and marketing teams should meet periodically to share updates and proposals regarding external communications. The engineering team needs to be aware that the content they develop is part of a collaborative effort, while support teams, who engage directly with customers, must align their communication style with the UX principles. The legal team plays a key role in ensuring that all legal content is clear and serves its purpose throughout the user experience. If a brand’s different communication platforms convey messages in varying ways, it may confuse people when they interact with each of them.While there is much to discuss regarding the impact of content design principles on all aspects of a product, it is important to remember that implementing these three principles to boost product sustainability is a manageable process. Once established, these practices will become self-sustaining.User experienceThe direct outcome of content design principles is evident in the user experience of digital services and products. While the quality of code and documentation is essential, sustainable digital products also depend on efficient infrastructure, optimised content delivery, and clear governance practices. Design decisions influence the overall system sustainability by shaping how resources are used and maintained over time. Oftentimes, the elements that make a product or service more sustainable are those that also make it good for users.Clear language: When utilising clear language, we should aim for terminology that is easily recognisable, constructing short sentences where each conveys a single idea. Unnecessary elements should be eliminated, and if elaboration enhances understanding, we should not hesitate to expand on specific points. All texts must be concise, informative, and distinct from one another. Button names must clearly indicate the actions they perform, enhancing usability. When we use clear language, we minimise the need to rephrase ideas, which leads to clear and concise texts that reduce code complexity.For international companies, a product glossary integrated into a content management system ensures that translations are automatically updated alongside content resources.Structured content: It is vital to create a logical hierarchy of information that guides the reader on what to consume first and what follows. Logical ordering through titles (h1, h2, h3) and subtitles makes code creation and navigation straightforward. During the content structuring process, it often becomes apparent what information should be retained and what can be discarded as excess. This clarity not only improves the overall code quality – impacting sustainability in tech companies – but also enhances product accessibility.Reusable content: While a design system has to offer flexibility we can identify various elements that can be reused in UX, such as titles, subtitles, labels, error messages, buttons. There is no need to recreate these components repeatedly. Reusable content ensures that your content remains agile and future-proof. Reusable terminology should begin with how we spell the company’s name. We should also standardise introductory texts that represent our product and its features, ensuring there are both short and long versions. Legal texts, including agreements – such as those that appear when users click buttons – should be streamlined. Understanding the meaning behind legal texts can reveal that some may be eliminated entirely – only when approved by a legal team – simplifying the user experience.Reusing content also contributes to sustainable coding. Each line of text that is reused is easily updated without requiring code rewrites. DITA is an excellent solution for this, and content management systems serve as practical and effective tools.Begin by assessing the content creation tools currently used in your company and align your work with your content design team’s guidelines. Utilise the terms in your product glossary, and if such a document does not exist, establishing it should be a priority. This process may be extensive, but the time invested is invaluable. Start with onboarding materials, titles and subtitles, and concise legal texts, alongside clear button labels. Ensure that the maximum character length is defined for labels in space-restricted modules. Ensure every word serves a purpose and aids people in navigating the content flow. When choosing a non-text content format, opt for the lowest-emission option that provides the most value.Collaboration with development teams is most important. Observing their meetings can provide insights into their coding practices and tools, enabling discussions on effective collaboration and the steps necessary to integrate sustainability practices into their workflows.LegalLegal texts are essential for everyone’s understanding, both within the context of user experience and beyond. However, legal terminology can often be confusing, highlighting the need for improvement.Clear language: Legal terminology can be transformed into easily comprehensible texts using clear language principles. It is well-established that even professionals in highly specialised fields prefer simple language over complex jargon.Structured content: Legal documents often contain lengthy texts that cover numerous specific topics, making navigation challenging. Typically, individuals do not need to access all sections simultaneously – instead, they need to quickly find relevant information. Here, clear titles and a logical sequence can significantly enhance usability.Reusable content: This practice is a common challenge for many legal teams. Documents may be reused for extended periods after being created and approved, resulting in new team members hesitating to make changes for fear of legal repercussions. Content reusability should not involve outdated or inaccurate material – rather, it is about maintaining the best pieces of content in terms of user experience and ensuring they are readily available as authoritative sources. Regular audit will ensure that the most current information is consistently reflected wherever the content is used.Start by creating a list of rules for updating legal texts, including approval processes, guidelines on the length of information, style of titles, and so on. Additionally, compile a document with links to all legal texts, including the date of the last update and the name of the person who signed it off.Content designers or UX writers can be invaluable in updating and restructuring legal texts. The UX research and support teams, who understand the audience best, can assist in finding the appropriate voice and testing whether the updated version is sufficiently clear or requires further iteration.In terms of sustainability, these practices can reduce excessive legal documentation, creating an environment where finding relevant, accessible, and up-to-date information benefits not only users but also the legal team itself.MarketingCopywriters, PR professionals, and CRM specialists often engage with audiences even before their first interaction with a product. The impact of these teams on sustainable communication practices is significant.Clear language: While clear language is essential for global marketing communications, exceptions may arise for local campaigns. For example, marketing teams operating in specific regions may use humour, or puns in slogans and calls to action. However, such language should be limited to local campaigns and must be tested and approved by local experts. In contrast, clear language is critical for onboarding materials that highlight the product’s positive impact on users’ lives and for website content that conveys the company’s values.Structured content: When detailing product benefits, focus on clarity and conciseness – avoid unnecessary repetition. For long-form content, adhering to general structuring practices is beneficial. In emails and SMS communications, ensure that title or subtitle conveys a clear action for the reader.Reusable content: This represents a significant opportunity for creating a sustainable environment within marketing teams. Proper categorisation and filtering of reusable content are vital. Important tags may include the applicable location, links to translations, approval names, campaign names, and target audiences.Begin with a source document containing all the baseline taglines and brief texts about the company, its products, values, and benefits. Align these messages with your audience and establish a single source of truth that specifies where, when, and how to use this content – shaping how you want your audience to perceive and remember your brand. Make your SEO decisions as strategic as the content itself.Distribute this document widely along with concise guidelines on when and how messages can be used independently and when your involvement is required. The UX team should have access to this document to incorporate the content into draft layouts of landing pages, for example. During the initial creation or updating phase, engage with all stakeholders involved in tone of voice decisions, including content designers or UX writers, business developers, and legal advisors.SupportCustomers seek empathy when reaching out to support, so clear and straightforward communication demonstrates care simply when it saves their time. Conveying a unified message also allows the support team to showcase the humanity behind the product.Clear language: These additions to clear language fundamentals help support teams work efficiently and thoughtfully, laying the groundwork for creating effective FAQ sections as the next step.Be transparent about decision-making processes.Avoid saying ‘sorry’ unless the error lies with the product.Do not claim to understand customers’ feelings – instead, focus on providing relevant information.Structured content: Support teams frequently provide information that can be structured for better scannability. By organising content effectively, both customers and support staff save time, fostering a sustainable workflow within the tech company.Reusable content: Developing templates for support chat messages and structured responses can significantly reduce the workload while ensuring a consistent tone of voice. Resources invested in creating and maintaining an up-to-date FAQ section or Help Centre are worthwhile, as they provide comprehensive guides not only for users but also for internal teams. These resources can facilitate onboarding for new employees and serve as a reliable reference for all team members.Begin by identifying existing templates and creating a repository for them. This will allow for easier updates, target audience identification, and ensure the team has a template to quickly address typical customer inquiries. This document should evolve into an accessible FAQ for users, followed by the iterative development of support chat templates. Collecting pain points and resolving them through clear, structured content is a significant investment that the support team can make for the company.Engage with other departments to avoid confusion in providing inaccurate information. Content designers or UX writers first to determine the best methods for collecting and transforming support data and user feedback into a useful FAQ section. Engineering and analytics teams possess valuable insights into how customers use the product and where they encounter difficulties. UX/UI designers can enhance the visual appeal and navigation of the FAQ section. This project requires careful planning – utilise a RACI chart to outline initial collaborators while remaining open to new partnerships as the project unfolds. Such initiatives will foster valuable relationships and collaboration opportunities.Internal communicationsContent design principles extend beyond external communication – they can significantly enhance internal workflows. While content designers may not be directly involved in improving processes, these practices can be used independently by everyone, fostering a sustainable environment within the company.Photo sourceDocumentationIn today’s tech environment, documentation is essential for capturing new features, projects, and approaches. With remote teams and varied work schedules, the need for accessible, written information is greater than ever.Clear language: Regardless of your role, create content that is accessible to all employees. Empathy is key – people prefer not to struggle with complex language when reading documentation. As mentioned earlier, even experts want clear, concise information. Consider including a list of terms in each document to ensure everyone uses consistent language.Structured content: Use descriptive titles that clearly reflect the document’s main ideas, and organise content logically. If a document covers different topics, consider splitting it into separate files. Clear cross-references and link names are essential for effective navigation, especially when different teams use varied tools. Streamline this process by implementing templates for common documentation types (such as project, feature, update, task, marketing, design, support, legal, content, research feedback). Utilise tags to enhance searchability and maintain a shared template space, accompanied by usage instructions to ensure consistency and sustainability.Reusable content: Documents templates enable their content reusability. Develop example project documents that colleagues can copy and adapt as needed, maintaining the initial structure and navigation to support sustainable documentation practices.Start by selecting an appropriate documentation tool. If that’s not feasible, create a simple document with links to all relevant workspaces to facilitate cross-referencing. Prepare a table covering key aspects of projects and share it with colleagues during meetings.While someone should oversee this documentation project, engaging collaboratively will enhance the effectiveness and relevance of the documentation.MeetingsMeetings can be time-consuming. To maximise their effectiveness and ensure that all participants understand their purpose, basic content design principles can be invaluable.Clear language: It is easy to overwhelm attendees with complex terminology. Prior to the meeting, refer to a word list related to the topic and provide explanations for any unavoidable jargon. Offer synonyms or brief descriptions to aid understanding. Facilitate discussions efficiently by actively listening, paraphrasing participants’ contributions, and reiterating key points using clear language.Structured content: A clear agenda, including a brief overview of the project and an introduction to all participants. Include a checklist of objectives to be covered, specifying priorities and the individuals responsible for each topic. This approach clarifies the discussion’s focus and the rationale behind each invitee’s presence.Reusable content: Meeting structures can and should be standardised. Create or adapt a template that includes comprehensive details and specifications, allowing for easy modification. It’s more efficient to remove unnecessary elements from a template than to add them later. This iterative process will help develop an optimal meeting format. Also, consider drafting an instruction guide for facilitators on starting meetings, summarising discussions, and achieving consensus, as meetings aren’t always about immediate decisions.Start by assessing the current structure of your meetings and gather informal feedback from colleagues about potential improvements. Compile valid suggestions into a single template and note any additional ideas that arise during discussions for future consideration. Establish fundamental meeting rules, such as starting with the project background, outlining current targets, introducing participants, and posting the agenda in advance – clarifying what ‘in advance’ means as well.Once you’ve refined these ideas with your immediate team and key collaborators, present the principles to your department, demonstrating their effectiveness by following your own guidelines.EmailsEmails are a concise form of communication where all three content design principles apply effectively.Clear language: Ensure your email is easy to understand. If using complex terms, provide a glossary at the end to clarify. Write as you would speak – if unsure, read it aloud to check its clarity.Structured content: Make your email scannable by avoiding unnecessary introductions. Be polite yet concise, expressing gratitude without lengthy pleasantries. Use titles for different topics or provide detailed project information. Include links to related projects to facilitate easy navigation.Reusable content: Titles can be reused as part of your email structure. For example, Meghan Casey’s ‘Content Strategy Toolkit’ suggests elements for an email agenda, such as:Introduction: Who you are.Overview of the project: What problem you’re solving.Why you need them: Specific tasks for each recipient.The team: A brief overview of team members.Expectations: What you request from the recipient.A big thank you: Acknowledge their commitment to reading your email.Start by experimenting with this structure, adapting it to your needs, and documenting it for team reference.Collaborate across the company to make this documentation easily accessible and promote the efficient email structure for all.OnboardingThe principles discussed in this article can serve as effective onboarding material. With clear documentation and a single source of truth for information, newcomers can self-onboard, reducing the time experienced colleagues spend answering their questions. This allows new hires to focus on role-specific information rather than general queries.Clear language: Avoid complex terminology without clarification. Provide a glossary to ensure newcomers easily grasp company values and rules. This initial interaction shapes their understanding of internal processes, making clarity essential.Structured content: Present information chronologically, helping newcomers absorb insights without needing to go back. Clearly indicate new information, its relevance to daily tasks, and provide examples. Videos can enhance onboarding, but ensure accompanying text summaries and subtitles for accessibility.Reusable content: While onboarding materials should cater to individual roles, core information should be reused across departments. This saves time and ensures consistency in presenting company values and rules. Structure this information to be general, with department-specific adaptations.Begin by gathering company values and rules in a straightforward format. Decide on the presentation style and tone of voice, which may differ from external communications. Typically, the internal tone is friendlier, allowing for a more casual approach.Collaborate with different departments, especially with an internal communications specialist. Ensure the recruiting team is aware of the onboarding materials provided during the first days and weeks of employment.​​The journey towards tech sustainability through content design principles reveals a fundamental truth: it’s not just about what we create, but how we create, manage and maintain it for long-term impact.When teams across the organisation write clearly, organise thoughtfully and reuse content systematically, they reduce waste and work more efficiently. These principles benefit both the environment and business by saving time, reducing costs and making information more accessible. Every tech professional who writes emails, creates presentations or develops documentation can apply these basics.The way forward is simple: create less, reuse more, and make every piece of content work harder for longer. This approach extends beyond content designers – it empowers everyone in tech to create more sustainable content.",

Create or adapt a template that includes comprehensive details and specifications, allowing for easy modification. It’s more efficient to remove unnecessary elements from a template than to add them later. This iterative process will help develop an optimal meeting format. Also, consider drafting an instruction guide for facilitators on starting meetings, summarising discussions, and achieving consensus, as meetings aren’t always about immediate decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"6d4f\"\u003eStart by assessing the current structure of your meetings and gather informal feedback from colleagues about potential improvements. Compile valid suggestions into a single template and note any additional ideas that arise during discussions for future consideration. Establish fundamental meeting rules, such as starting with the project background, outlining current targets, introducing participants, and posting the agenda in advance – clarifying what ‘in advance’ means as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"52de\"\u003eOnce you’ve refined these ideas with your immediate team and key collaborators, present the principles to your department, demonstrating their effectiveness by following your own guidelines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"b630\"\u003eEmails\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp id=\"bb20\"\u003eEmails are a concise form of communication where all three content design principles apply effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"29bf\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClear language\u003c/strong\u003e: Ensure your email is easy to understand.

Structure this information to be general, with department-specific adaptations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"59ab\"\u003eBegin by gathering company values and rules in a straightforward format.
