Yet often it‚Äôs difficult to pinpoint a problem as user feedback tends to be not specific enough. But: we can use a few simple techniques to assess how users understand and perceive content. Let‚Äôs take a look. Part of How To Measure UX \u0026 Design Impact by yours truly.Content testing is a simple way to test the clarity and understanding of the content on a page ‚Äî be it a paragraph of text, a user flow, a dashboard, or anything in between. Our goal is to understand how well users actually perceive the content that we present to them.It‚Äôs not only about finding pain points and things that cause confusion or hinder users from finding the right answer on a page but also about if our content clearly and precisely articulates what we actually want to communicate.This article is part of our ongoing series on UX. You can find more details on design patterns and UX strategy in Smart Interface Design Patterns¬†üç£ ‚Äî with live UX training coming up soon. Free preview.Banana TestingBanana Testing: Replace all key actions with the word ‚ÄúBanana,‚Äù then ask users to suggest what it could be. (Large preview)A great way to test how well your design matches a user‚Äôs mental model is Banana Testing. We replace all key actions with the word ‚ÄúBanana,‚Äù then ask users to suggest what each action could prompt.Not only does it tell you if key actions are understood immediately and if they are in the right place but also if your icons are helpful and if interactive elements such as links or buttons are perceived as such.Content HeatmappingContent heatmapping, a simple technique to evaluate content and how well it performs. (Large preview)One reliable technique to assess content is content heatmapping. The way we would use it is by giving participants a task, then asking them to highlight things that are clear or confusing. We could define any other dimensions or style lenses as well: e.g., phrases that bring more confidence and less confidence.Then we map all highlights into a heatmap to identify patterns and trends. You could run it with print-outs in person, but it could also happen in Figjam or in Miro remotely ‚Äî as long as your tool of choice has a highlighter feature.Run Moderated Testing SessionsThese little techniques above help you discover content issues, but they don‚Äôt tell you what is missing in the content and what doubts, concerns, and issues users have with it. For that, we need to uncover user needs in more detail.Too often, users say that a page is ‚Äúclear and well-organized,‚Äù but when you ask them specific questions, you notice that their understanding is vastly different from what you were trying to bring into spotlight.Such insights rarely surface in unmoderated sessions ‚Äî it‚Äôs much more effective to observe behavior and ask questions on the spot, be it in person or remote.Test Concepts, Not WordsRemoving doubts before they happen with front-loading key details. (Large preview)Before testing, we need to know what we want to learn. First, write up a plan with goals, customers, questions, script. Don‚Äôt tweak words alone ‚Äî broader is better. In the session, avoid speaking aloud as it‚Äôs usually not how people consume content. Ask questions and wait silently.After the task is completed, ask users to explain the product, flow, and concepts to you. But: don‚Äôt ask them what they like, prefer, feel, or think. And whenever possible, avoid the word ‚Äúcontent‚Äù in testing as users often perceive it differently.Choosing The Right Way To TestThere are plenty of different tests that you could use:Banana test üçåReplace key actions with ‚Äúbananas,‚Äù ask to explain.Cloze test üï≥Ô∏èRemove words from your copy, ask users to fill in the blanks.Reaction cards ü§îWrite up emotions on 25 cards, ask users to choose.Card sorting üÉèAsk users to group topics into meaningful categories.Highlighting üñçÔ∏èAsk users to highlight helpful or confusing words.Competitive testing ü•äAsk users to explain competitors‚Äô pages.When choosing the right way to test, consider the following guidelines:Do users understand?Interviews, highlighting, Cloze testDo we match the mental model?Banana testing, Cloze testWhat word works best?Card sorting, A/B testing, tree testingWhy doesn‚Äôt it work?Interviews, highlighting, walkthroughsDo we know user needs?Competitive testing, process mappingWrapping UpIn many tasks, there is rarely anything more impactful than the careful selection of words on a page. However, it‚Äôs not only the words alone that are being used but the voice and tone that you choose to communicate with customers.Use the techniques above to test and measure how well people perceive content but also check how they perceive the end-to-end experience on the site.Quite often, the right words used incorrectly on a key page can convey a wrong message or provide a suboptimal experience. Even though the rest of the product might perform remarkably well, if a user is blocked on a critical page, they will be gone before you even blink.Useful ResourcesPractical Guide To Content Testing, by IntuitHow To Test Content With Users, by Kate MoranFive Fun Ways To Test Words, by John SaitoA Simple Technique For Evaluating Content, by Pete GaleNew: How To Measure UX And Design ImpactMeet Measure UX \u0026 Design Impact (8h), a new practical guide for designers and UX leads to measure and show your UX impact on business.
