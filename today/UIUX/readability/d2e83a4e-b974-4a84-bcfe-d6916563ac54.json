I hope this article offers valuable insights and inspires you to explore new creative possibilities in UI design.OBS: Before we dive into what a hover state is and how to use it in your digital product (software), let’s first look at the types of interaction. In the HCI field, there are different types of interaction. Still, in this article, we’ll focus on just two: cursor-based interaction and touch-based interaction, also known as natural interaction.Cursor-based InteractionThe cursor is the virtual representation of the mouse or pointing device within the operating system environment. It acts as an essential visual indicator, especially in desktop environments and on tablets that use styluses. The cursor should support precise operations and hover states to boost app productivity, simplify interactive tasks, and optimize information displayWhen designing interfaces that rely on cursor-based interaction, it’s important to keep in mind some guiding principles, which are:Function expression: When the cursor hovers over an object or specific area in the interface…",
