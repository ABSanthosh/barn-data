CORE Discovery for Creatives Cost: $489-$1729 |  Length: 15 videos, 4 hours | By: The Futur, Jose Caballer CORE Discovery from The Futur, taught by Jose Caballer, “empowers you, the creative, to hold Discovery work sessions with your clients to define, align and generate insights for all the key stakeholders, allowing you to go from being an “order-taker” to being a powerful strategic leader and valued partner to your clients and community. This course focuses on a collection 6 key exercises (Culture, Customer, Voice, Feeling, Impact and X-Factor) in which Jose Caballer walks you through in a series of videos. There are templates and explanations and some print outs for live facilitation too. This is design strategy framework and while it’s one of the more insightful courses on the market, it is tiered towards senior designers who have been in the game some time. A lot of background knowledge is required, which is why I preferred the aforementioned Brand Master Secrets as it teaches you these advanced principles to actually help you position yourself as an expert and be confident in selling through strategy as a service. On a side note, you could actually learn the fundamentals with Brand Master Secrets then use the CORE framework for your sessions, so they can work in tandem quite well. Who is this for? CORE is an advanced ‘course’ for those who understand what strategy is and are looking for a framework to help improve their process and facilitate workshops of their own. Activate Your Strategic Brain Cost: $299 | Length: 8 Hours | By: Stef Hamerlinck Activate Your Strategic Brain will help you master the fundamentals of brand strategy and become a more valuable designer, allowing you to create better design solutions for your clients. Although I still in the midst of taking this course, the modules seem quite promising: The key concepts: brand purpose, personality, customer, value proposition, How to sell brand strategy and how to price it How to do a workshop with your client How to think strategically and get beyond the brief How to bridge the gap between strategy and design The course covers the whole spectrum of brand strategy, from selling, facilitating, positioning to preparing for design. The goal is to become a more complete and strategic designer, so you can charge more and create brands that connect with their audience. Who is this for? Designers who want to jump straight into the core concepts of brand strategy to help better their designs and service offerings, at a slightly more affordable rate. Stef also has a few separate niche courses (modules) on brand strategy: How to Facilitate a Brand Workshop – $79 –  Learn how to get on the same page with your client, build trust and create better design outcomes. Brand Strategy Research – $299 This module shows the magic ‘under the hood’ of a lot of brand strategies. Research is what drives powerful insights that are the foundation for strong brands. Brand Strategy Fundamentals – $79 Get a deep understanding of the key concepts that drive brand strategy and its relation to marketing and business strategy. eResonaid by Fabian Geyrhalter Cost: $649-$949 | Length: 1.5 Hours, 15 Videos | By: Fabian Geyrhalter Fabian Geyrhalter is an acclaimed brand strategist, author and podcaster, who I had the pleasure of interviewing, and he has taken his one-day brand strategy workshop, which he has done hundreds of times around the world, and made it into an online course, ready for the taking. eResonaid will help “Define your company, your culture and your story, while drawing your audience into your offering”. This course consists of 15 videos that range between 3-10 minutes in length, so it’s short and sweet. But what I found the most valuable, were the PDF worksheets that came with it, including an interactive PDF workbook that acts as your hands-on guide through the course. You can take this and easily apply it for your own clients. Fabian includes 2x 1-on-1 30min advisory calls within the price to gain feedback and guidance on your discovery journey or to course-correct if necessary. (But you could always go with the basic version of the course if you do not see value in it). As a bonus, you also receive Fabian’s two branding books in e-book format. You can easily complete this course in a day, making it an extremely condensed version of strategy, that will help provide brand clarity, without the fluff. Who this is for? eResonaid is perfect for someone who needs to learn or apply brand strategy quickly since you can easily get through the course in a single day. Story Brand (SB7) by Donald Miller Cost: $275 (yearly subscription) | Length: 10 hours | By: Donald Miller Although Story Brand (based on the book) is a messaging framework, it’s worth mentioning because it is solid framework to help sell any product or service. In fact, the principles of Brand Story are used on the home page of JUST Creative. You won’t learn how to become a brand strategist, but you will learn how to hook your customers with a “story brand”. The basic premise is this: “A CHARACTER who wants something encounters a PROBLEM before they can get it. At the peak of their despair, a GUIDE steps into their lives gives them a PLAN, and CALLS THEM TO ACTION. That action helps them avoid FAILURE and ends in a SUCCESS.” Each of these 7 bolded chapters/modules come with actionable step-by-step guides that help you implement what you’ve learned into your own brand. There is also a free online tool that guides you through the implementation process. This course used to be $1500 but has just recently dropped to $275 as part of their Business Made Simple subscription which now includes three all-new courses on Marketing, Leadership, and Emotional IQ. Who is this for? Someone who wants to improve their messaging \u0026 marketing skills, with an easy to follow framework, at a great value price. LEVEL C – By Marty Neumeier Cost: Varies | Length: 1-2 days  | By: Marty Neumeier Marty Neumeier, “the grandfather of branding” is running Brand Masterclass Workshops around the world. Unlike the other courses on this list, this course is done in person (now also online due to COVID), in locations such as London, LA, Philly and Dublin. The workshop is called Level C because they are on a mission to permanently place the role of “BRANDING” in the C-Suite (aka CEO, CBO, CDO). This best part? This Masterclass Workshop is a certification so when you’re finished, you will become a Certified Brand Specialist and you can level up to their 5+ certifications. Graduates from the London masterclass have already used this credential and are leveling up into roles such as Global Director of Marketing, Head of Strategy, Head of Brand, and more — which means higher levels, broader scopes, more influence, better titles, and more money! Although not technically brand strategy, you master modern brand building disciplines hands-on, and in the process build connections along the way, meaning you can level up together. It goes without saying, this is a rare opportunity to get up close and personal with some of the best in the industry and get certified in the process. See their website for dates and prices as they range depending on level. Who is this for? For someone who prefers to work within a classroom format \u0026 wants certification to level up their career.
