It involves placing electrodes on the skin surface to detect the electrical signals generated by muscle fibers during contraction. These signals are then amplified, processed, and analyzed to provide valuable information about muscle function, activity, and fatigue.Basically, we can use our body movements, gestures and even micro-movements) as input to a digital device.Why is it relevant in…",
