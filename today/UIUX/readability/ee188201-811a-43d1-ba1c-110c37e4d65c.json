Image credit: Microsoft.DesignRecently, I was moved to a project that has both, internal and external users: It’s an Azure tool for support where both users communicate with each other in the platform. The uniqueness of this tool reminded me how much I have worked in internal tools through my career, and how little I had to solve for customer-facing problems.Because the majority of my career has been focused on internal cloud solutions for infrastructure, monitoring and reactive and proactive support, I am a bit biased towards internal tools. The job has given me a front-row seat to the intricacies of building UIs and UX workflows that keep massive corporate gears turning.From a design perspective, internal products might not get the same kind of public praise and press that external-facing apps enjoy, but their critical nature within large organizations can sometimes drive more interesting design challenges than you’d expect. Designing internal vs. external tools is not just about preference; it’s also about different pros and cons, trade-offs, and exciting opportunities. Let’s dig into the biggest differences I’ve noticed.1. Impact",
