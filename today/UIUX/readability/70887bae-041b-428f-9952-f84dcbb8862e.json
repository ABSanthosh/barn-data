This Black Friday, our friends over at the Interaction Design Foundation (IxDF) have a gift for you: 25% off UX design courses on new memberships and a $200 discount on UX Bootcamps for new and existing members. The offer is now open and ends at midnight on Cyber Monday, 29 November.        Looking to expand your current skill set or conducting research to kickstart a career in UX design? Then look no further. This Black Friday weekend, the IxDF is offering great discounts on their membership as well as Bootcamps that will help you with your career growth. In case you aren’t familiar with the Interaction Design Foundation, here are some reviews: “A goldmine of information on interaction design.”— Don Norman    “Ivy League level education in UX, Product Design, or Human-Computer Interaction.”— Forbes.com And if you’re one of the over 110,000-strong IxDF community, you can avail of a $200 discount on the upcoming cohort of Bootcamps. Unlike most other UX Bootcamps which are one-size-fits-all, the IxDF offers a range of Bootcamps to cover different requirements. If you’re new to UX, then the UX Fundamentals Bootcamp is the ideal starting point, and if you already have some experience under your cloak and are looking to up your UX skills, the User Research and UI Design Bootcamps may be more appropriate. And finally, there’s the UX Portfolio and Career Bootcamp to help you package your skills and prepare for job interviews. Each Bootcamp is part-time and fully remote and includes individual mentorship from industry professionals. The demand for UX professionals will continue to grow as businesses make a comeback. Glassdoor has found that in the United States, UI and UX designers have an average yearly salary of $85,277, and experienced UI and UX designers can earn up to $128,000. It is an ideal time for investing in a credible education provider who can teach you the in-demand UX skills.
