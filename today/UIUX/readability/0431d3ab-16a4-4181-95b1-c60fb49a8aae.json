From the moment we started using the software, we were impressed by its user-friendly interface and intuitive design. Whether you’re a professional designer or a homeowner, Cedreo has everything you need to create beautiful and detailed designs. One of the things we loved about Cedreo was the wide range of design options available. The software has pre-designed templates that cover a broad range of architectural styles, making it easy to get started. The templates can be easily customized to fit your specific needs, ensuring that the blueprint accurately reflects your vision. In addition to the pre-designed templates, Cedreo has a vast library of 3D objects that can be easily incorporated into the design.

With its user-friendly interface, a vast library of design options, and exceptional customer support, Cedreo is a must-have for anyone looking to create stunning blueprints. What is Cedreo? Cedreo is a 3D home design software that allows users to create professional-looking floor plans and 3D renderings for residential construction projects. It is primarily used by architects, builders, and interior designers to quickly generate accurate and detailed floor plans that can be customized to meet the specific needs of clients. Cedreo offers a variety of features, including an extensive library of pre-designed floor plans and customizable templates, drag-and-drop tools for creating walls, windows, doors, and other building components, and the ability to import external 3D models and images to enhance the design. In addition to creating 3D renderings, Cedreo also offers tools for generating accurate construction documents and detailed material lists, making it a useful tool for project management and collaboration between different teams involved in the construction process. One of the standout features of Cedreo is its ability to create professional-looking 3D renderings in just a few clicks. This feature allows users to see their designs come to life and provides an accurate representation of what the finished product will look like. Cedreo offers both a free and paid version, with the subscription version providing full access to the catalog and additional features. The free version is an excellent option for beginners or those on a tight budget, but we found the paid version to be more comprehensive and worth the investment. With its powerful tools and user-friendly interface, Cedreo is a top choice for home design software. Pros of Cedreo One of the biggest pros of Cedreo is its user-friendly interface. The program is easy to navigate, and the drag-and-drop tools make it simple to create detailed designs quickly. Additionally, the library of customizable objects and textures is extensive, which means we have plenty of options to choose from when designing a space. We also appreciate the real-time rendering capabilities, which allow us to see our designs in 3D and make changes on the fly. Another pro of Cedreo is its cloud-based platform. This means that we can access our designs from anywhere, which is especially helpful when collaborating with clients and other team members remotely. The software program is also constantly updated with new features and tools, which means that we can be sure we are always working with the latest version. Cons of Cedreo One potential downside of Cedreo is its pricing. The software program is not the cheapest on the market, and the pricing structure can be confusing at times. Additionally, while the program is versatile and can be used for a wide range of projects, it may not be the best option for large commercial projects or highly complex designs. Features Cedreo offers a range of features and tools that make it easy to create detailed and accurate 3D designs. Some of the key features include: Drag-and-drop tools: Cedreo’s drag-and-drop tools make it easy to create detailed designs quickly. Library of customizable objects and textures: The program comes with a wide range of customizable objects and textures, which means we have plenty of options to choose from when designing a space. Real-time rendering capabilities: Cedreo’s real-time rendering capabilities allow us to visualize our designs in 3D and make changes on the fly. Cloud-based platform: The software program is cloud-based, which means that we can access our designs from anywhere. Regular updates: Cedreo is regularly updated with new features and tools, which means that we can be sure we are always working with the latest version. Cross Section + Cross Elevations I was excited to hear that Cedreo released this new ‘Cross-section’ feature that allows you to create elevations in just one click! Cross-section plans as they call it, are easy to generate. I could simply create a cut directly on my plan and preview the results live. The best part was that these plans were automatically modified as soon as the floor plan was modified! And I could mark it up and download it in 300 dpi! So if you’re looking to create a complete a complete construction document quick fast, Cedreo is the perfect choice. Presentation Feature Back in early 2024, Cedreo launched a feature to allow housing professionals to create the presentation documents they’ll use to showcase their projects to their clients directly in Cedreo. This comes in both 2D and 3D floor plans but also in their cross section, elevations plans, as well as site plans. What’s great is that the plans integrated in the presentation update automatically if you make any changes in the design, so it saves time and helps avoids mistakes. Here is an example of presentation they can create in Cedreo: April 2025 Update: Cedreo Adds Electrical Plan Feature We just tested Cedreo’s new electrical plan feature, and it’s a solid addition that allowed us to annotate 2D plans including floor plans, roof layouts, elevations, and more. We could use curved lines and directional arrows to map out lighting and power points visually. We found it intuitive, snappy, and it actually felt like a real workflow feature, not just a checkbox feature making it perfect for early-stage planning. Bravo Cedreo!
