  "text": "Summary:¬† Generative-AI outputs need to be concise, scannable, follow the inverted pyramid, and use plain language. Users don‚Äôt read ‚Äî they scan. To accommodate this behavior, content writers use techniques like chunking, bullet points, and strategic formatting to improve scannability. Unfortunately, many product teams have forgotten these principles in their rush to include generative AI (genAI) tools. Our recent study showed that AI-generated content often violates fundamental principles of writing for the web. Emulate Broad-Scope AI Tools Concision Formatting for Scannability Inverted Pyramid Approachable¬†Language Learning About the User We recently ran a study looking at how people use various product-embedded genAI features like Carvana‚Äôs Sebastian or Instagram‚Äôs AI search and how these tools compare with broad-scope, general-purpose AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity. Overall, we found that, although not perfect, broad-scope AI chat tools produce outputs that are more scannable and easier to read than narrow-scope, product-embedded AI tools. While AI teams might not have control over the outputs generated by an LLM, it is worth exploring options for finetuning outputs and following best practices for web writing. This issue may be eventually addressed as these product-specific AIs integrate broad AI models that already adhere to the principles of writing for the web. However, users may not have the patience to wait until then. ChatGPT is a gold standard for content design in genAI. Its formatting and structure all aid the user‚Äôs comprehension. Concision Here at NN/g, we follow the slogan \"Brevity = Brilliance.\"¬†Shorter text increases user comprehension and engagement. Users read only about 20% of written content on any given web page, so it‚Äôs doubly important that those words count. Generative AI outputs often end up being unnecessarily long. Take a look at this output to the question What are pet-friendly rug materials? from Rufus, Amazon‚Äôs generative AI. Compare it to the much shorter human-revised version. üö´ AI-Generated: Too Wordy ‚úÖ Human-Revised: Concise When choosing a pet-friendly rug material, consider the following options: Wool - Wool is a popular choice for pet owners as it is durable, naturally stain-resistant, and easy to clean. Its dense fibers can withstand heavy traffic and accidental spills. Synthetic Fibers - Synthetic rugs made of nylon, polyester, or polypropylene are also pet-friendly. They are resistant to stains, moisture, and wear, making them ideal for high-traffic areas. Sisal And Jute - These natural fibers are durable and pet-friendly, but they are not as stain-resistant as wool or synthetic materials. They are best suited for low-traffic areas or areas where pets are less likely to have accidents. Leather - Leather rugs are durable and easy to clean, making them a good choice for pet owners. They are resistant to stains and odors, and their smooth surface makes it difficult for pets to scratch or damage them. Consider these pet-friendly rug materials: Wool: Naturally stain-resistant and easy to clean Synthetic Fibers: Resistant to stains and wear Leather: Stain-resistant and hard to damage Sisal and Jute: Durable but less stain-resistant When interacting with genAI chatbots, our participants struggled to find the information they needed to complete their task or just got frustrated with the amount of text they needed to sort through. They told us: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a lot of information. I‚Äôm someone that likes concise information. The question was [‚Ä¶] a yes-or-no question, so [‚Ä¶] that‚Äôs why I was like 'That‚Äôs a lot of info for just yes or no.'‚Äù ‚ÄúThe rest of the information [‚Ä¶] is just a sales pitch for the other products that accompany it; [...] everything else is [‚Ä¶] fluff‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúIt gives a lot of information. I could have done with ‚ÄòWhat is Smart Things? Oh! It‚Äôs where you can connect all your smart home devices and run them off of one thing.‚Äô That‚Äôs all I need. Which it did say [‚Ä¶], but it also said a lot of things.‚Äù ‚ÄúWow, very chatty. My question is very short, very concise, and it‚Äôs giving me a very long response with some options. Which is kinda nice, I suppose. But I don‚Äôt need all this information.‚Äù Participants also repeatedly mentioned needing a shortened version or a summary to help them digest all the information provided. ‚ÄúOr maybe just again like a short synopsis and then ‚ÄòHey, do you want to know more?‚Äô And then, if you click that button, [‚Ä¶] it gives you all the things that I don't care about.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure there are [people] out there who would love all this information, but I would definitely like a ‚Äî What is that called? A TLDR or whatever‚Äù While summaries could increase users‚Äô ability to consume the content, they might not be necessary if the information was formatted for scannability. Formatting for Scannability Another guideline for writing for the web is to use scanning-friendly formatting choices that break up text and direct attention to the most important information. Some examples include: Bullet points Bolding Italics Headings and subheadings that break up text ¬† Product-specific genAI outputs included numbered lists and bullet points fairly frequently. But those lists often lacked indentation and appeared exactly like another paragraph of text.¬† Amazon‚Äôs Rufus: The output often included bulleted lists. However, the poor formatting made these bulleted lists hard to scan. Many product-specific genAI features also failed to use bold, italics, and underlining to emphasize key points, forcing users to dig through fluff and unnecessary details to find the information they were looking for. The following example from Rocket Mortgage shows how a little formatting can make the same information easier to read. üö´ AI-Generated: Poor Formatting ‚úÖ Human-Revised: Helpful Formatting As a first-time home buyer, here are some key steps to take: 1. Save for a down payment (as low as 3% for some loans). 2. Improve your credit score. 3. Pay down existing debt to improve your debt-to-income ratio. 4. Consider first-time home buyer programs, which may offer benefits like lower down payments.

For more information, check out: First-Time Home Buyer Qualifications Is there anything specific about the home buying process you'd like to know more about? Inverted Pyramid The inverted pyramid for text is another basic guideline of writing for the web. In this style, the need-to-know information is presented first, followed by the less critical details or explanations. The inverted pyramid allows users to get the basic information (and the only information they most likely need) fast, so they don‚Äôt have to search for the right heading or bullet point. Currently, the use of the inverted pyramid is hit or miss in genAI responses. Some models will use this structure more frequently than others, but there is no guarantee. Take, for instance, the following example from Perplexity. Even though Perplexity tends to provide a summary up front, this time a high-level overview was part of the conclusion. üö´ AI-Generated: End with Summary ‚úÖ Human-Revised: Leads with Summary 5G is the latest generation of cellular network technology, offering significant improvements over 4G in several key areas: Speed: 5G provides much faster data transfer speeds than 4G. While 4G speeds typically range from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps, 5G can reach speeds of up to 20 Gbps in ideal conditions. Latency: 5G offers lower latency, with ideal rates around 1 ms compared to 4G's 10 ms. In real-world conditions, 5G latency is about 5-10 ms, while 4G averages 30-70 ms. Frequency: 4G uses frequencies below 6 GHz, while 5G operates on a wider spectrum, including higher frequencies up to 300 GHz (mmWave)12. Capacity: 5G networks can support approximately 1 million devices per square kilometer, compared to 4G's 4,000 devices in the same area. Infrastructure: 5G uses a combination of traditional cell towers and small cells densely deployed for higher frequencies, whereas 4G primarily relies on large cell towers. Use cases: While 4G was mainly designed for phones, 5G is more flexible and can support various applications like smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and IoT devices. These improvements in speed, latency, and capacity make 5G better suited for data-intensive applications and emerging technologies, although the full potential of 5G may take years to be fully realized. 5G is the latest generation of cellular network technology, offering improvements over 4G in speed, latency, and capacity. These improvements make 5G better suited for data-intensive applications and emerging technologies. Speed 5G provides much faster data transfer speeds than 4G. Latency 5G offers lower latency ‚Äî or the speed of data transfer from server to device after instruction ‚Äî than 4G. Frequency 5G operates on a wider frequency spectrum allowing it the ability to connect and communicate with more towers. Capacity 5G networks can support more devices per square kilometer compared to 4G. Infrastructure 5G uses a combination of traditional cell towers and small cells for higher frequencies, whereas 4G only uses towers. Use cases While 4G was mainly designed for phones, 5G can support various applications. One user even noted that the inverted-pyramid format was a factor in his¬†decision to use Perplexity. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the reasons I have Perplexity on my bar. I like it when they give the answer right away [...], and then they explain it, and then it has a recommendation or conclusion. I always like this format.‚Äù When asked to compare his experience with Perplexity versus Rufus, the same participant considered Perplexity ‚Äúa lot better‚Äù due to its clearly structured responses. ‚ÄúThe formatting of the answer is a little bit better with Perplexity. It‚Äôs always going to give me the answer, a little tidbit, and then it concludes. With Rufus, even though my question was short and casual, it came with really long technical stuff. [‚Ä¶] Based on this example, yeah, Perplexity is a lot better!‚Äù Approachable¬†Language Another frequent complaint against genAI was the use of jargon¬†‚Äî technical terms unique to a certain interest group or profession. When writing for the web, aim for a 6‚Äì8th-grade reading level ‚Äî that is,¬†use simple sentences and words that the average user can understand. GenAI outputs often included jargon. Even when users were asking an entry-level question, the responses contained technical terms that assumed familiarity with the domain. This is such a common problem with genAI that you can find jargon in all the examples in this article. (The 5G one was especially egregious.) This next example from ChatGPT isn‚Äôt as bad, but with our minimal tweaks, it becomes much easier to understand. üö´ AI-Generated: Dense, Technical Language ‚úÖ Human-Revised: Plain Language 4-wheel drive (4WD), also known as four-by-four (4x4), is a drivetrain system that sends power to all four wheels of a vehicle simultaneously. It is primarily used for off-road or low-traction conditions, such as snow, mud, sand, and rocky terrain. How It Works: Selectable 4WD: Many vehicles allow the driver to switch between 2WD (usually rear-wheel drive) and 4WD as needed. Full-Time 4WD: Some vehicles have a permanent 4WD system that automatically distributes power to all four wheels. High and Low Gears: Some 4WD systems offer a 4H (high-range) for regular driving in slippery conditions and a 4L (low-range) for extreme off-road situations that require more torque. Difference Between 4WD and AWD (All-Wheel Drive): 4WD is typically found in trucks and off-road SUVs. It is better suited for rugged terrains and is often manually engaged. AWD is usually found in cars and crossovers, automatically distributing power to all four wheels as needed for better traction. Would you like to know more about how to use 4WD in different conditions? 4-wheel drive (4WD) sends power to all four wheels of a vehicle simultaneously. It is primarily used for off-road or low-traction conditions, such as snow, mud, sand, and rocky terrain. It is also known as four-by-four (4x4). How It Works: Selectable 4WD: The driver can choose to power all four wheels or only the rear two. Full-Time 4WD: The vehicle automatically powers all four wheels. High and Low Gears: Some 4WD systems offer different gears for specific terrains. Difference Between 4WD and AWD (All-Wheel Drive): 4WD is better suited for rugged terrains and is often manually engaged. AWD is suited for everyday driving and automatically turns on as needed for better grip. Would you like to know more about how to use 4WD in different conditions? The only thing harder than reading content not designed for scanning is reading it when you don‚Äôt understand a quarter of the words. Participants were regularly frustrated with the jargon terms, especially when they had asked a simple question. ‚ÄúMy question was short and casual. And a couple of times it came with really long technical stuff. And as I mentioned before, someone who asks such a basic question,¬†all those technical terms go over their heads.‚Äù ¬†‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs way too much of the technical things for me.‚Äù Learning About the User Human writers often make assumptions about the user and adjust their content accordingly. GenAI must begin doing the same. As many of the previous issues show, genAI does not often evaluate users‚Äô contexts, matching simple prompts with long, technical responses. While all writers should meet users where they are, genAI can learn about the user and adjust writing styles and recommendations in real time. GenAI needs to ask followup questions and make educated assumptions about users‚Äô needs and contexts. If a user asks a simple question, the AI should respond with a simple response. If the user asks for something too broad, the genAI should follow up and build context to better support the user. ChatGPT will ask followup questions to create context and match users‚Äô needs. A study participant asked for help finding warm, durable gloves, expecting recommended product listings. Instead, Rufus offered detailed information on different types of gloves (e.g., waterproof gloves, leather gloves, ski gloves) and popular brands for each ‚Äî without a product in sight. ¬† A study participant asked Rufus to find gloves and was disappointed by the output‚Äôs high level of detail. That level of detail lengthened the output and offered information that was completely irrelevant to the user. As a result, some study participants felt that AI wasn‚Äôt the best choice for quick, useful information. ‚ÄúI find that sometimes AI answers can just be really annoying [...] it doesn't understand what I'm asking or it just provides me [with] random information that is [‚Ä¶] not relevant‚Ä¶‚Äù Conclusion One of the biggest selling points of generative AI is that it can make us more efficient. But, if AI can‚Äôt replicate basic rules for writing for the web, it will ultimately fail at that goal. Users want to find relevant information as quickly as possible. GenAI needs to adopt these best practices of writing for the web to deliver truly useful information.",
