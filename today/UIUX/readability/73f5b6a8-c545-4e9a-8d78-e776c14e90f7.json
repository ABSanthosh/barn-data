It’s a philosophy I’ve built my career on, and it’s exactly what I had the chance to talk about in my latest feature with Marketer+, Poland’s leading marketing publication. In this interview, I share my journey—from starting JUST Creative in Sydney, to working with global brands like Disney, Nike, and San Francisco Tourism, to building the Brand Builders Alliance™, a global community for creative pros serious about turning their skills into sustainable businesses. We also get into: My perspective on AI’s impact on branding and creativity What it really takes to stand out in a noisy market Why strategy always comes before visuals And how I’d approach building a brand from scratch in Gdańsk, Poland Plus, the story behind that flamingo you keep seeing—yep, Pinky makes an appearance too. Whether you’re a marketer, designer, entrepreneur, or somewhere in between, I hope this feature brings you clarity, inspiration, and maybe even a few bold ideas. 📰 Read the full Polish interview here otherwise read the English version below. Let me know your biggest takeaway in the comments! Building Brands That Stand The Flock Out with Jacob Cass, Founder of JUST Creative Let’s start with you and your professional journey. What is your professional background? I’ve been passionate about design and branding for as long as I can remember. My journey started in Sydney, Australia, where I studied graphic design and quickly found my way into the world of branding. Early in my career, I worked for agencies and brands like Disney, Nintendo, and Nike, gaining valuable experience in design, strategy, and marketing. While studying full-time, I launched JUST Creative as a blog and portfolio to share my work and thoughts on design. It quickly gained traction, leading to freelance opportunities and eventually allowing me to go full-time with my own business. Over the years, JUST Creative has evolved from a design blog into a branding consultancy, helping businesses worldwide build strong, strategic brands. The transition from designer to brand strategist came naturally. I realized that design alone wasn’t enough, as businesses needed a solid strategy to make an impact. That’s what excites me the most: combining creativity and strategy to create brands that not only look great but also deliver real results. Do you have your definition of brand and branding? A brand is the perception people have of a business, product, or individual. It’s what they think and feel when they interact with you. Branding is the process of shaping that perception through strategy, design, messaging, and experience. Many people think branding is just about a logo, but it’s so much more. It’s about defining who you are, what you stand for, and how you connect with your audience. Great branding creates trust, recognition, and loyalty. Who do you want to help? What do you want to change in the market? What lesson can you give to the world? I want to help business owners, entrepreneurs, and creatives build brands that make a real impact. Whether it’s a startup looking to stand out or an established brand needing a refresh, my goal is to help them create something meaningful and memorable… one that Stands The Flock Out.  One thing I’d love to change in the market is the misconception that branding is just about visuals. Too many businesses skip the strategy and go straight to design, which often leads to weak or forgettable brands. Branding is about purpose, positioning, and storytelling and getting that foundation right makes all the difference. The biggest lesson I’d share is that branding is an investment, not an expense. A strong brand creates trust, attracts the right customers, and ultimately drives business growth. How would you explain in one sentence what JUST Creative is and what distinguishes you, your company, from others? JUST Creative is a full-service branding consultancy where you work directly with me, Jacob Cass. There are no agency layers and no middlemen. Just 17+ years of expertise, a proven process, and a hands-on approach that takes your brand from strategy to launch with precision, creativity, and a focus on real results. Simply put, I help businesses Stand The Flock Out. Why the  flamingo? This is not a bird native to Australia. What’s the story here? The flamingo, or Pinky, is more than just our brand’s mascot. It’s a symbol of what JUST Creative stands for: boldness, creativity, vibrancy, and standing out. It all started with our brand color, pink, which has been part of JUST Creative since 2007.  In 2020, after a successful pro-bono project for a friend’s gym that had a lion as a mascot, I asked myself, What if our brand had a mascot? The flamingo naturally came up, but not just because of its color, but because of what it represents: uniqueness, confidence, and creativity. From an initial office poster to social media traction, the flamingo stuck in people’s minds. And when AI tools became more accessible in 2023, I explored hundreds of designs, refining Pinky’s look to match our brand’s aesthetic. After experimenting with AI-generated models, I brought in a professional 3D artist to bring Pinky to life in a way that AI alone couldn’t. Now, Pinky is a core part of the JUST Creative identity… a sleek, low-poly, vibrant magenta flamingo with signature sunglasses, designed to Stand The Flock Out. It’s a reminder to embrace creativity, be distinctive, and lean into what makes you unique! What is creativity for you? When can I say “I’m creative”? Creativity is about connecting ideas in new and meaningful ways. It’s not just about making something look cool. For me, it’s about problem-solving, storytelling, and dare I say it, innovation. You can say you’re creative when you bring fresh perspectives, think outside the box, and create something that resonates with others. I don’t believe it’s just limited to artists or designers because everyone has the potential to be creative in their own way. And my young kids are living proof of that. How did you make Jacob from Australia known even 15,699 km away? Consistency, value, and community. From the early days of JUST Creative, I focused on sharing knowledge, creating high-quality content, and engaging with others in the design and branding space which I continue to do today. By writing about my passions of design, branding, and strategy, I built an audience that extended far beyond Australia. Blogging, social media, speaking engagements, and hundreds of collaborations all played a role in growing my global reach. Providing value first has always been the key. How to stand out from the rest? How do you distinguish yourself, your company, and your product in this extremely overcrowded and noisy market? The key to standing the flock out is being both distinctive and differentiated. You need to be clear on what makes you unique and why people should choose you over the competition. This starts with defining your brand strategy… your purpose, positioning, and personality. It grows from there. For JUST Creative, differentiation comes from the fusion of strategy and design, my direct, hands-on approach, and the unique personal brand I’ve built – Pinky included. But more than that, it’s about how I educate, engage, and provide real value. Consistently showing up, sharing expertise, and building genuine connections is what makes a brand unforgettable. What is the cost of a bad brand strategy? A weak or poorly executed brand strategy can cost a business everything. It leads to confusion, lack of trust, lost opportunities, and ultimately, lost revenue. A quote I always come back to is “If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design.” which can be applied to strategy as well.  Without a clear brand strategy, businesses struggle to differentiate themselves, attract the right customers, and create a lasting impact. Investing in a strong brand strategy upfront saves time, money, and effort in the long run. Imagine you are about to start working on brand strategy for a company based in Gdansk, Poland. a) How would you start working in a country or culture that is not well known to you? The foundation of any successful brand strategy is deep understanding. The first step is to align with the company’s goals, so I would have to understand what they want to achieve, who they want to reach, and how they define success.  From there, research becomes key. I would immerse myself in understanding Poland’s cultural and consumer landscape, analyzing market trends, competitors, and local business practices to identify opportunities for differentiation. However, research alone isn’t enough. To build a truly authentic brand, firsthand insights are essential. If possible, I’d spend time on the ground, engaging with local experts, businesses, and consumers or at minimum, get representatives of the company to do so. Speaking with people directly provides invaluable context, as you learn what resonates with them, what they value, and what makes them tick.  b) What are the first questions you ask? What are your business goals, both short-term and long-term? Who is your target audience, and what do you know about their needs, values, and behaviors? What makes your company unique in the Polish market? What challenges are you currently facing with your brand? How do you want your brand to be perceived by your customers? What competitors or brands do you admire, and why? How will success be measured? What branding advice would you give Polish companies? (Do you know any Polish companies or have you worked for a Polish company?) I’ve worked with hundreds of brands globally, but I haven’t worked directly with a Polish company… yet. (Hint, hint!). However, the same branding principles apply everywhere… clarity, differentiation, and consistency are universal. Who is The Brand Builders Alliance™ for? The Brand Builders Alliance is a membership community for creative professionals who want to master branding and build a thriving business.  It is designed for designers, strategists, marketers, and entrepreneurs who are looking for expert guidance, actionable resources, and a supportive network.  Members get access to exclusive training, live coaching, and a community of like-minded professionals who are all working toward the same goal of creating impactful brands and growing their businesses.  Do you still design? Many strategists started as designers but then stopped designing. Which client project are you particularly proud of and why? Yes, in my heart I am still a designer and always will be, but my role has shifted more toward strategy and consulting. Design is still a huge part of what I do, but I now focus more on the bigger picture, helping businesses define their brand strategy before executing the visuals. One project I am particularly proud of is working with the city of San Francisco on a full brand transformation alongside Miles Partnership. It was a deep, strategic overhaul paired with a fresh visual identity, designed to create a stronger emotional connection with locals and travelers.  My logo design went through extensive user testing, competing against numerous other concepts and after multiple rounds of research and validation, it consistently outperformed alternatives, proving its effectiveness through real data. Seeing it not only stand out but also resonate with people was incredibly rewarding! And it makes for a nice feather in my cap! What is AI’s impact on branding and design? Pinky Mascot Evolution. From 2D logo to AI model to Human-Made 3D Mascot AI is changing the game in branding and design, and overall, I think it’s for the better. It speeds up processes, helps generate ideas on the fly, and automates repetitive tasks, allowing us to focus on higher-level strategy and execution. I see AI as a powerful tool for brainstorming, prototyping, and automating tasks at scale. That said, AI comes with its challenges. It lacks true creativity, human intuition, and the emotional depth that great branding requires. There’s also a risk of brands becoming more generic if they rely too heavily on AI-generated content without injecting their own unique perspective. The ethical concerns around originality, ownership, and deepfake-style manipulation are also something to be mindful of. At the end of the day, AI is just that… a tool. The people and brands that succeed will be the ones that use AI to enhance their creativity, not replace it. The human ‘just creative’ touch will always be what makes branding truly impactful. What is your next professional and personal dream (or maybe it is the same one)? Right now, my focus is on growing The Brand Builders Alliance™ into a tight-knit, high-value community for brand builders. I want it to be more than just another community… it should feel like a true home for designers, strategists, and creative pros who are serious about leveling up. Whether through mentorship, resources or the global network, my goal is to create real opportunities for creatives to learn, connect, and grow together. On a personal level, I’m all about balance… raising my family in Sydney, traveling the world, swimming, sipping great wine, playing football (soccer), and making the most of every moment. Branding never stands still, and neither do!  I’m excited to keep evolving, pushing creative boundaries, and helping people build brands that truly stand the flock out.  Flock yeah!",
