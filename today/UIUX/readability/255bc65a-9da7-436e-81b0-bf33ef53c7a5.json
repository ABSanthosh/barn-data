  "text": "Last December, I was laid off from my UXR job at Spotify. A year later, time and reflection have provided me with fresh and valuable perspectives.September 2022: I just wrapped up my Spotify internship in Stockholm, about to start as a full-time User Researcher.One year ago, I was part of the 17% who were impacted by the layoffs at Spotify. This was a moment that completely shifted the course of my career and life. Earlier this year, I wrote about this raw and emotional experience in my article, Life After Spotify: What No One Tells You About Life After Layoffs. I shared the shock, uncertainty, and lessons I learned in those early days. In the months that followed, I found myself fighting with questions about my identity, my career, and what I truly wanted moving forward. It wasn’t easy, that is for sure. But now, a year after the life-changing transition, I’ve gained personal and professional insights that only time and introspection can bring.Here are the key lessons I’ve learned — not just about recovering from a layoff, but about navigating the tech industry, growing as a junior professional, and finding resilience in the face of uncertainty.My Spotify journeyWhen I joined Spotify, it felt like a dream come true. The company’s mission to connect people through music aligned perfectly with my Music Psychology background, and the opportunity to work at the cutting edge of the tech and music industries was beyond exciting. My role as a UX Researcher allowed me to collaborate with talented people, solve complex problems, and contribute to projects that had a real impact on users around the world. It was a place where I felt valued and energised, and I truly believed I had found my professional home.So when the layoff news came on December 4th 2023, safe to say it was a shock. The news hit hard — not just because of the suddenness, but because it felt like the end of a chapter I’d worked so hard to build. It was a reminder that, despite our best efforts, external factors beyond our control can change everything in an instant. Losing my role was more than just the loss of a job; it felt like losing a piece of my identity and the future I had envisioned for myself.The learningsSetbacks are temporary: layoffs are not the endSetbacks like layoffs, can feel overwhelming at the time, but they are rarely the end of your story. One door may be closed, and then doors open for unexpected opportunities you might not have otherwise considered. It’s a reminder that careers are not linear, and setbacks are simply a part of growth. By treating challenges as temporary redirections rather than permanent failures, you allow yourself the space to adapt, explore, and eventually find a new path forward.Your job is what you do, not who you areYour job is what you do, not who you are — a truth that became clear to me after being laid off. It’s easy to tie your identity and self-worth to your role, especially if it’s at a company or in an industry you’re passionate about. But no title or company can fully define who you are or what you’re capable of. By focusing on your skills, values, and passions — rather than just the work you do — you create a stronger, more grounded sense of self that can weather any career change. Remember, your job is just one part of your journey, not the sum of your identity.I’m grateful to have had the chance to attend such fun events at Spotify such as Listening Lounge. This was taken the day Loreen came to perform at the office!Layoffs aren’t personal: understand the business side and know your worthLayoffs aren’t personal — a hard truth that took time for me to understand. While it’s natural to feel rejected or question your abilities, layoffs are often the result of financial decisions, restructuring, or market shifts — not a reflection of your value. It’s important to separate your self-worth from the company’s business decisions. Recognise that your skills and contributions are still valid, even if your role was impacted. By understanding the business side of layoffs, you can shift your perspective, focus on your strengths, and approach the next chapter with confidence and clarity.Resilience requires restResilience isn’t just about pushing through challenges, it’s also about knowing when to rest and recharge. After my layoff, I felt the pressure to constantly stay busy. Networking, job hunting, learning new skills — believing that every moment of downtime was a wasted opportunity. But I soon realised that true resilience comes from balance. Taking time to rest, reflect, and prioritise self-care gave me the mental and emotional space I needed to recover and refocus.Burnout can erode your ability to think clearly, make good decisions, and show up as your best self. By allowing yourself periods of rest, you build the energy and mental clarity needed to tackle the next challenge with renewed strength. Resilience isn’t about enduring without pause — it’s about knowing when to rest so that you can show up stronger when the time comes.Reflect, don’t just reactWhen faced with a setback like a layoff, it’s tempting to react immediately — rushing into job applications, accepting the first opportunity that comes your way, or making hasty decisions out of fear. But one of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned is the importance of pausing to reflect before acting. Taking the time to assess what you truly want in your next step, what aligns with your values, and where you can grow will lead to more intentional and fulfilling choices. Reflection helps you process the emotions tied to a layoff, understand what you gained from your previous role, and clarify your long-term goals. Instead of reacting to external pressures, it allows you to act with purpose, ensuring that your next move is a step forward, not just a step away from your current situation. Sometimes, the most productive thing you can do is pause, think, and recalibrate before diving back into the job race.Embrace your passions and expertiseLosing a job can often lead to a crisis of confidence, making it easy to question your value. However, embracing your passions and expertise can be a powerful tool in navigating the uncertainty of a layoff. It’s important to remember that your passion for certain areas and your unique set of skills are what set you apart. Whether it’s a niche technical skill, a deep industry knowledge, or a creative passion, don’t lose sight of what you bring to the table. This is your opportunity to pivot towards projects or roles that align with both your expertise and your heart, creating a career path that’s not only fulfilling but also sustainable in the long run. The combination of what you’re skilled at and what you’re passionate about can lead to new, exciting directions in your career that you may not have considered before.Presenting my Master’s thesis on How AI Can Help Bridge Cultural Gaps in Music Therapy at The Future of Music and Arts in Medicine and Health conference in Berlin, September 2024 (left) and attending the International Music Summit in Dubai (right)For me, it’s been embracing my Music Psychology background through starting writing on Medium, attending conferences to present my research work, and finding new freelance clients for music workshops.Flexibility is a superpower: the importance of a growth mindsetFlexibility isn’t just about adapting to changes in your current role or industry — it’s also about being open to geographical or professional shifts that might take you out of your comfort zone. When I lost my job, I had to leave Sweden and move to Dubai to be back with my family, a significant change that forced me to rethink not only where I lived but also how I approached my career. While the transition was challenging, it taught me that location doesn’t have to limit opportunity and that a new environment can bring fresh perspectives and possibilities.Similarly, being open to professional change — whether it’s pivoting to a new industry, learning a different skill set, or exploring a side hustle — can lead to unexpected growth. The tech world moves quickly, and the roles in demand today might look completely different in a few years. By staying curious and adaptable, you prepare yourself to thrive in a constantly shifting landscape. Flexibility isn’t just about surviving change, it’s about thriving in uncertainty and finding opportunities where others might see obstacles.Juniors bring value: don’t undermine your contributionsAs a junior professional, I’ve struggled with not feeling like my contributions don’t hold as much weight, especially in a team full of senior professionals. But juniors bring unique value: fresh perspectives, adaptability, and a willingness to learn that often drive innovation. Looking back, I realise that every small task, new idea, or extra effort added value to the team and the projects I worked on — and I received such feedback from my colleagues. For juniors, celebrate your contributions and approach every opportunity with confidence. Your perspective matters and your energy can often spark the kind of change or creativity a team needs.Your network is your net worthThe people you’ve worked with or simply stayed connected with are invaluable when navigating career challenges. Whether it’s offering advice, sharing opportunities, or providing emotional support, a strong network can make all the difference. Building genuine relationships isn’t just about LinkedIn connections or professional gain, it’s about creating a community that grows with you. Invest time in nurturing those relationships — you never know when they might lead to your next opportunity or a helping hand when you need it most.My fellow team of amazing UX researchers at Spotify (left) and some of my Sharing product team (right)!The tech industry is volatile: always expect changeThe tech industry is inherently volatile, and one of the most important lessons I learned is that change is constant. Whether it’s market shifts, company restructuring, or new technologies disrupting the landscape, the pace of change can be overwhelming. At Spotify, I saw firsthand how decisions made at the corporate level — often driven by external factors — can drastically reshape the trajectory of a business and its employees.So, expect change and be prepared for it. Building a career in tech means accepting that stability is an illusion and that adaptability is key. Being proactive about staying informed on industry trends, continuously upgrading your skills, and cultivating flexibility in your career plans can help you navigate the uncertainty. Embracing change, rather than fearing it, allows you to stay resilient and seize new opportunities even when the landscape shifts unexpectedly.Embrace the uncertainty: growth happens outside of your comfort zoneEven a year after the layoffs, I’m still navigating the uncertainty that came with it. While I’ve learned a lot, there are days when the lingering questions about my career, the future of the industry, and my next steps feel as daunting as ever. The uncertainty left behind by the layoff continues to shape the way I approach my career — whether it’s exploring different industries, considering geographical moves, or questioning my long-term goals. But what I’ve come to realise is that this uncertainty is part of the process. It’s not something to fight against, but something to lean into.The discomfort of uncertainty can be uncomfortable, but it’s also where new opportunities lie. When you let go of the need for certainty and embrace the unknown, you open yourself to new experiences, personal growth, and unexpected paths. The best things often happen when you push yourself beyond what you know — whether it’s taking on a new role, exploring a different industry, or simply choosing a different approach to work.The takeaways and where I am nowThe journey of navigating a layoff has taught me that while uncertainty can feel overwhelming, it’s also an essential part of growth. As I continue to navigate this ambiguity, I’m learning to embrace the fluidity of the journey. Instead of seeking immediate answers or forcing things to fall into place, I’m allowing myself the time to reflect, explore, and grow. While the uncertainty may never fully go away, I’m learning that it’s not something to fear, but a space for new opportunities to unfold.Embracing change and remaining adaptable is key to thriving in the volatile tech industry. I’ve learned that setbacks are temporary and that our jobs are just one part of who we are. Building a strong network, staying flexible, and approaching challenges with a growth mindset have opened doors to unexpected opportunities, and hopefully will continue to pave the way to many more. Ultimately, embracing uncertainty, taking time to reflect, and knowing when to rest are helping me not only recover from the impact but also redefine my career and personal growth on my own terms.",
