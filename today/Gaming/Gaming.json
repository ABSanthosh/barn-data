But as far as id Software co-founder and Doom co-creator John Romero is concerned, Game Pass is beneficial to the video game industry.Via True Achievements, Romero was recently interviewed by Xbox Expansion Pass, and he was effusive with his praise for Game Pass.\"I love it,\" said Romero. \"I mean, who doesn't love Game Pass? It's Netflix for games; who doesn't want that? It's great because it's try before you buy... one thing after another thing. Really the barrier for people to play games is just access to those games. Even free-to-play games, it's like, knowing that those games exist, and Game Pass is like 'Here they are!'\"Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The long-awaited third entry in the popular series was originally scheduled to hit stores on November 19, but it was delayed by several months. Volume 2 released way back in 2017, so nearly eight years have passed since Insight Editions' last collection of art and commentary. As such, Volume 3 has a lot of ground to cover, and it will begin right where Volume 2 ended. This means fans who own all three volumes will have cohesive collection of artwork chronicling the development of Destiny 2 over the past decade.You can preorder The Art of Destiny Volume 3 for $50 at Amazon. Additionally, you can pick up the first two books at a discount.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

You'll wish you'd been dusted by nuclear fire when you're being torn open by some kind of demon puppet in a labyrinth of red curtains. If you do get torn open by a demon puppet, the good news is that players have a range of artificial bodies to choose from. Among Phantom Line's headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners. If all this sounds appealing, the even-gooder news is that there's now a demo available via the developer Discord. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Pick one: colorful shoes or a colorful sweater? Let’s go with the colorful shoes. Life is too short for boring footwear! 2. Which would you rather never have to deal with again: nosy neighbors, parallel parking, burnt food or washing your makeup brushes? Once, I caught a neighbor going through our trash. So I could do without the nosy neighbors, LOL! 3. Have you ever crimped your hair? Yes, but sadly, I never got to do it in the ‘80s (I was too young and missed all the cool stuff). 4. Who does the grocery shopping in your household? Mostly me, but El Hub will do it if he has extra time and/or if I’m busy with Connor doing extracurriculars. 5. Liquid liner: yes or no?

    "description": "(NOVATO) Today in cat science news! Rosie brought the full force of her four PhDs in science to solve a canine conundrum. The dilemma? Well, she started a dog training service, and she’s been trying to train Marnie, but sadly, it has not gone well. Rosie, being the cat genius she is, figured out that the key to making Marnie more receptive to instruction is to wear her out. To that end, Rosie got to work. From her lab at the Cat Academy of Sciences, she developed a new cutting edge treadmill that automatically adjusts its speed to efficiently tire out a canine jogger. So far, results have been good. Marnie has been jogging on the treadmill for 24 straight hours. At this rate, it looks like she might — might — start to get tired in a few days. 🙂 Hard to say, though. Marnie is on the track team at the University of Derp, so she has pretty incredible endurance.
