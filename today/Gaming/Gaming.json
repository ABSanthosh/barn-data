It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1.Something you accomplished recently that makes you feel good?

It took a while to figure it out, to be honest. I’m feeling good about it, and I think she is too; I’m hoping it sets her up with good habits for the future. 2. Last beauty product you bought? I grabbed a cream shadow from Charlotte Tilbury, the Eyes to Mesmerise Cream Shadow in Oyster Pearl, a shimmery bronze-gold, from the Sephora fall sale. 3. Pick your fun eyeliner color – green, purple or blue? Purple, please! 4. Walking outside in the rain – yes or no?[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 856 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Novato police are on the lookout for a burglar who broke into the Novato Museum of Cat Antiquities last night. Detective Rosie was first on the scene. “Meow,” she said, when asked for a description of the burglar. The break in occurred shortly after 2:00 AM, and police were alerted when the burglar set off the museum’s security alarm. Police put out an APB and started a manhunt…although video surveillance suggests the suspect could be a canine. “Meow,” said Detective Rosie. If you or someone you know has information that leads to the arrest of the Novato Museum of Cat Antiquities burglar, Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC is offering a reward. Company founder and former Chief Feline Officer Tabs was a captain in the Canadian Cat Mounties before embarking upon his successful career as a kitty supermodel and entrepreneur, and the company continues to be a strong supporter of law enforcement. “Meow,” said Rosie again. Sooner or later, we’ll catch this criminal.
