    "description": "EA has been revealing a ton of detail about the changes and additions it's bringing to College Football 26, and today it revealed its stadium rankings. Taking into account crowds, noise, and \"hostile atmosphere,\" EA has produced a list of the toughest stadiums in college football for visiting teams.Part of EA's focus on improving its representation of the traditions, spirit, and overall vibes of particular campuses, this list of tough stadiums is probably not going to be too surprising to most college football fans.

Aligned with college football stereotypes and memes, you're not going to find any California schools on the list. However, college football fans are nothing if not ferociously loyal, so I'm sure this list will still find a way to spark heated debate. You can see the full list below.Among EA's changes to the CFB formula designed to up school spirit include more rivalry trophies, school-specific events like marching band formations and run-outs, and a much bigger roster of mascots.

    "description": "This time of year, Tabs was always pretty stoked about showing off his summer bod, which as you know, was curvy, Rubenesque and voluptuous. With this being the official weekend of the summer solstice, this morning I asked Rosie if she had any big plans for summer, and she just stared at me blankly and meowed something under her breath that sounded like “science waits for no one.” I took that as a “no.” 😂 Marnie’s sure been enjoying these longer summer days. In fact, she insists on waking me up at the crack of dawn so that she can go running with me, and by running I mean sprinting circles around me as I shuffle along… I believe she thinks that I am her sheep. 🐑 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Select Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 865 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you care about Labubus? Nah, I just don’t get the hype. 2. What’s your favorite summer dessert? Hmm, all of them? If pressed to pick one, then ice cream. 3. Do you have plans for the Fourth of July yet? Connor will be dancing with her dance team in the town parade, so that’s our main event during the day. We’ll probably do a barbeque at home after the parade. Where we live doesn’t allow fireworks, so we may or may not go looking for a fireworks display. We’ll see how ambitious we’re feeling! 4. How do you feel about maxi dresses? If it’s in a petite size and the print isn’t too overwhelming, then I’ll rock a maxi dress, for sure. 5.
