    "description": "One of the most popular Nintendo Switch and PC controllers sold by Amazon is on sale for a great price. The ManbaOne Wireless Controller, which released in March 2024, is up for grabs for $56 (was $70) as part of the retailer's Big Spring Sale. This matches the lowest price yet for this pro-style controller with a built-in miniature display. Yes, the ManbaOne has a terrible name, but it's a pretty awesome controller that impressed us when we tested it last year. Both the white and black models are included in the promotion. ManbaOne Wireless Controller $56 (was $70) Works with Switch, PC, iOS, AndroidFour remappable back buttonsAvailable in white and blackHall Effect analog sticksCustomizable lightsSix-axis gyroscopeBuilt-in displayTrigger locksThe ManbaOne Wireless Controller packs in tons of features and is highly customizable. Its main attraction is a built-in two-inch display, which lets you quickly change settings without the need for an app or additional software. Beyond that standout feature, this is a feature-rich pro-style controller.That means you’ll find four remappable back buttons, premium Hall Effect analog sticks to prevent drift, trigger locks for faster actuation, and a fully customizable RGB lightbar on its side. Toss in a turbo setting and six-axis gyro support, and you’ve got a controller that’s incredibly well-equipped for less than $60. As a bonus, the ManbaOne comes with its own charging dock and a set of interchangeable thumbsticks.Both the white and black versions are discounted, and they’re both pretty stylish. The white model is a bit more mechanical, as it shows off various components underneath the faceplate, while the black model is closer to what you’d expect a traditional controller to look like. See at Amazon Buy Black Though the ManbaOne is on sale for a solid price, it’s not the only notable controller discounted in Amazon's Spring Sale. It's not even the only controller with a built-in display. The Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra for Xbox and PC has a built-in screen with similar features, though it's much pricier at $170 (was $200). The Asus ROG Raikiri Pro has an OLED screen, but it's largely used for customizable animations and displaying settings.More Gaming Controller Deals at AmazonIf you're looking for more budget-friendly wireless controllers, we've rounded up a selection of other notable third-party gamepads on sale at Amazon this week. Numerous 8BitDo controllers have received price cuts, including the new 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller for PC and mobile and the modular Victrix Pro BFG Wireless Controller for Xbox and PC. The latter is on sale for an all-time low price of only $108 (was $180).Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which is the hardest to do: engage in small talk with strangers, ask for directions, paint your toe nails or cook a meal without a recipe? For the life of me, I can’t make most meals without having a recipe to follow. I’m not one of those people who can cook from the heart and throw ingredients together with abandon. I need precise measurements (because one person’s pinch of salt might mean something completely different to someone else) and guidelines, otherwise I’ll short circuit. 2. Do you wanna go dancing at the pink pony club? Sure, why not? I’m gonna keep on daaaaaan-cing… 3. What language would you like to be fluent in: French, Cantonese, Arabic or sign language? All of them. LOL!

It looks like the economy is slowing down a bit, so no more Tuesday all-you-can-eat turkey or free five-egg omelets in the cafeteria. She wants everyone in the company to cut back, and that includes Rosie and Marnie. Starting immediately, there will be no more kibble showers! The leadership committee is hard at work identifying opportunities for process improvement… Rosie and CHO (Chief Hugging Officer) Whiskers are upping the napping quota by a staggering 15%! That means more hugs for everyone! Or else!!! It’s gonna be rough for a while. Hopefully things turn around soon. I have faith in Rosie’s leadership ability. And where many leaders lack empathy, she really goes out of her way to show she cares about people. It’s very motivating! Marnie is totally fired up about it.

    "description": "I was, like so many of my 1990s-born peers, a huge Sims girlie. I spent hundreds of hours as a teen and young adult making people I knew, characters from shows I was obsessing over, or original characters I wanted to experiment with, and diligently following their life paths and ambitions. I played it as a traditional life sim and I also got into all the weird, scrappy lore. I played with all the cheats and glitches and I, of course, put my sims in the pool and took the ladder out so that they were forced to drown. Try as I might, I could not capture any of these feelings in InZOI, Krafton’s early access life simulator that I would not typically immediately compare to another game if it did not beg for it by lifting every part of its design from the 25-year-old series that defined the genre. At first, navigating my shiny, photorealistic, model-perfect Zoi’s around the shiny, photorealistic, model-perfect world, I feared that I am simply thirty years old and that the whimsy in my heart has withered with time. But in the end, I must insist that it’s not me who is wrong. InZOI simply has awful vibes. Read more",
