Lego Wicked Emerald City Wall Art (1,518 pieces) $160 | Releases September 1 This massive 1,518-piece set lets you build a wall art display of the Emerald City as it appears in Wicked: For Good. The detailed set features several 3D elements, including two display sections to place the included Glinda and Elphaba minifigures. The set also includes additional minifigures of Dorothy, Toto, Scarecrow, Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion.

The building also includes interior details, such as a kitchen and bedroom. Preorder at Lego Store Lego Wicked Elphaba's Retreat (228 pieces) $28 | Releases September 1 The 228-piece Elphaba's Retreat playset recreates a forest scene from the movies and includes minifigures for Elphaba and Fiyero, as well as accessories such as the Grimmerie, wild rabbits, carrots, and numerous books and potions.

You can even mix and match pieces if you want to build your own unique mash-up character. Preorder at Lego Store Lego Wicked Welcome to Emerald City (945 pieces) $84 (was $100) Unlike the above sets, this one (and the three below) originally launched alongside the first movie and are already available. The Welcome to Emerald City Set is a large playset that includes five minidolls--Glinda, Elphaba, The Wizard, Madame Morrible, and Fiyero. The big draw, however, is the buildable tower, offering a variety of rooms to explore and accessories to interact with.

Two minidolls for Elphaba and Glinda are also included. The whole playset folds closed for easy storage, morphing into Glinda's lockable trunk (which makes for a cool piece of décor). See at Amazon Lego Wicked Elphaba \u0026 Glinda Figures (558 pieces) $44 (was $55) Not to be confused with the BrickHeadz Figures, these are more like traditional dolls. The two figures are highly posable and equipped with tons of accessories (such as brooms, crowns, and purses), giving you plenty of ways to change up their looks. See at Amazon Lego Wicked Glinda, Elphaba, and Nessarose at Shiz University (304 pieces) $24 (was $30) This set lets you build a small dollhouse and sailboat and includes minidolls for Glinda, Elphaba, and Nessarose.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What time of the day are you at your best? From 5:30 until about 11 in the morning. Everything is downhill after lunch, which is when I turn into Sleepy Spice, hahaha! I don’t know when it happened, but somewhere along the way in the last 10 years, I became a morning person. 2. Things you like in your smoothie? Greek yogurt, vanilla protein powder, raspberries (for fiber!) are my favorites. I also like bananas or apples for sweetness. 3. Something about your current makeup routine that bugs you? Ugh, the concealer I’ve been using from MAC just doesn’t seal well after I use it. Bits and bobs of it end up all over the place. It’s super messy and it bothers me. 4.

    "description": "Rosie should have known better than to trust Marnie with Rosie’s investments. After all, Marnie doesn’t have any background or credentials or expertise in financial planning. There was no reason to think Marnie would be able to manage Rosie’s assets, but Rosie wanted to give her a chance. Oh, well. Bad move on Rosie’s part. Even someone of Rosie’s intellectual stature screws up sometimes. Sure, she may understand quantum physics better than any other cat on the planet, but that doesn’t mean she understands compound interest. Sigh… Now Rosie has to think of a way of to recoup all those losses. Hmm… What could she invent?
