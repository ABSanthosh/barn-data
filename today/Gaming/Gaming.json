    "description": "Overwatch 2 has introduced a new competitive multiplayer mode, Stadium, where you play a best-of-seven series of matches. This mode is drastically different from other Overwatch 2 game modes for a number of reasons. First, there is a limited pool of heroes, with only 18 to start, though more will be added in the future. Second, it's a third-person game that takes place across several rounds, each consisting of shortened matches similar to Push. Lastly, and most importantly, it has new abilities and perks you buy in between rounds, allowing you to create unique builds of your hero.As a match unfolds, you'll earn currency every round, and in between rounds, you gain access to the shop, where you can buy permanent upgrades for the rest of the match. Because of this new system, you are locked to the character you choose at the start of the match and cannot swap later, making this a massive change from other modes. For example, Soldier 76 has multiple powers he can choose from. One will briefly activate his ultimate after firing a Helix rocket, while a different power will increase his primary fire power by 0.5% for each continuous shot fired. These different powers and abilities can drastically change how a hero plays, creating a dynamic new competitive mode.Over the course of a match, you can get up to six items, which can be sold at any point, and four powers, which you are stuck with once acquired. Below, we have listed every hero currently available in Stadium mode, along with their character-specific abilities and powers, followed by a list of universal items.

    "description": "This one's a touch delayed - we didn't attend either the New York or Paris reveal events - but Nintendo arrived in London on April 11 to showcase Switch 2 and Digital Foundry was invited. And by and large, we like what we see. Yes, there's a certain degree of continuity and familiarity moving from the original Switch to its successor, but from our perspective, the hardware hits the spot: bigger, brighter, better. And as for the games, well, it's early days of course, so there is an expected quality divide between first and third-party efforts, but Mario Kart World? That looks like a system seller, right there. Read more",

Since then, Fatal Fury has become a relic of the past, loved only by those with wrinkles on their face and a place for gaming classics in their hearts. That flickering ember remains dormant no longer with Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, a grand resurgence with more money thrown at it than the next unsustainable AI start-up. But does City of the Wolves have what it takes to carve a home for itself in a market dominated by Street Fighter, Tekken, and more? Judged on what I've played, I'd say it's got a damn good shot at doing so. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. How many lip products do you typically carry with you: 1-2, 3-5 or 5+? Lately, I’ve been pretty streamlined, so it’s usually one or two things – lipstick and a gloss! 2. What nail colors have you been into lately? Pale opaque baby blues. Perhaps I’m having a mid-’90s nostalgia moment, ha! Remember that baby blue nail polish by Hard Candy? I couldn’t get enough of it. 3. Which would you rather do: an afternoon outdoor picnic or late night stargazing? Afternoon picnic because I’m pretty sure I’d be too sleepy to stargaze late at night, hahaha! 4. Scrambled or sunny side up? Both! But if it’s scrambled, I’ve got to be the one making the eggs. I’m weirdly picky about my scrambled eggs.

One of Tabs’ little-known side hustles would have made him even MORE super popular around the neighborhood but, unfortunately, he had to keep his real identity under wraps.
