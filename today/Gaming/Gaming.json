    "description": "Fortnite's first-ever Star Wars season brought with it one of the biggest meta shifts in the game's history by tossing out almost the entire loot pool and replacing it with Star Wars weapons. The only items left over from Chapter 6 Season 2 are standard healing items and shockwave grenades--in other words, things that never go away. Otherwise, it's a whole new ballgame out there.The biggest surprise, however, is not really the guns themselves, but the lack of quick movement items. In Season 2, we had the Kneecapper and two different types of rockets that we could use to squirrel our way out of all sorts of dire situations. Escape was always possible with that loot pool. But those days are very much over.For the Star Wars season, shockwave grenades are now the lone common movement item. You can train with a hologram character to get a lightsaber that will allow you to sprint a little bit faster, but this is something only a handful of players will have the chance to do each round of battle royale. You can also use Slap Juice to give yourself unlimited sprint for a short period, which works well in conjunction with the lightsaber, but Slap doesn't make you move any faster on its own. So no, you're not whining without cause--this season is a lot slower paced than Season 2 was.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Vagabond Definitive Editions (Hardcover) Volume 1 is on sale for only $31 (was $55). Get deal on Volume 1 All Definitive Editions at Amazon Vagabond Definitive Edition Volume 1, one of the most exciting premium manga releases of the year so far, is on sale for only $31 (was $55) at Amazon. The gorgeous 728-page hardcover was published by Viz Media in January. This display-worthy tome collects the first three volumes in Takehiko Inoue's legendary series that's widely regarded as one of the best manga within its genre.Viz Media's Vagabond Definitive Edition project continued in April with Volume 2, and two more volumes are scheduled to release in the coming months.Vagabond Definitive Edition Manga Series:Vagabond Definitive Edition Vol. 1 (Hardcover) -- $31 ($55)Vagabond Definitive Edition Vol. 2 (Hardcover) -- $49.44 ($55)Vagabond Definitive Edition Vol. 3 (Hardcover) -- $51.15 ($55) | Releases July 15Vagabond Definitive Edition Vol. 4 (Hardcover) -- $55 | Releases October 21 Vagabond Definitive Editions (Hardcover) Volume 1 is on sale for only $31 (was $55). Vagabond's new oversized hardcover editions are printed on high-quality art paper, allowing Inoue's beautiful and brutal visuals to really shine. One other cool aspect from a presentational perspective is that the covers have a textured finish, which we've seen in other Deluxe Edition manga, too. So far, 37 individual volumes of Vagabond--collected in 12 books--have been published. By the end of 2025, the first four Definitive Editions of Vagabond will be available, each of which contains three individual volumes in hardcover format.Fans will be able to add one new Definitive Edition to their shelves every three months. Volume 2 was published on April 15 and is available for $49.44 (was $55) at Amazon. You can preorder Volume 3 for $51.15 ahead of its July 15 release. Volume 4 is set for publication on October 21 and is currently full price ($55).Volume 1 is the lengthiest of the four Definitive Editions at 728 pages, but all four hardcovers include over 600 pages: Vol. 2 is 632 pages, Vol. 3 is 616 pages, and Vol. 4 is 664 pages.As a reminder, with Amazon's preorder price guarantee, you'll be charged the lowest price offered from the time you order to when your book ships.Vagabond has been on hiatus for a decade; Inoue shelved the project to focus on his health and pursue other projects. In the years since, Inoue has continued his basketball-themed series Real, which is an inspiring manga centered around wheelchair basketball that initially debuted in 1999. There's no indication that Inoue will return to Vagabond in the future, but the current volumes are worth reading for their intricate plotting and mesmerizing visuals.If you're new to Vagabond and don't want to drop $31-$55 to check it out, most of the previously released paperbacks, which contain three volumes each, can be purchased from Amazon for around $20 each. Get deal on Volume 1 All Definitive Editions at Amazon If you've never read it, Vagabond follows the tale of Shinmen Takezou through 16th-century Japan. Also known as the legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, the manga is a fictionalized account of his life and is based on Eiji Yoshikawa's novel Musashi. A decades-spanning story, Vagabond focuses not only on the battles that made Musashi a legend but also on the more intimate moments of his life as he strives for enlightenment, through stunning art.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Pick how much ice you’d like in your drink: all the way to the brim, half full, a few cubes or no ice at all? Half full, please. That’s purr-fect! 2. Have you ever raised a puppy or a kitten? Yes. It’s a wonderful experience, but be prepared to have your nice things destroyed! Oh, and you can forget about your couch ever looking pristine again. 3. How often do you hit the snooze button in the morning? Just once. I used to just get up when the alarm went right off, but lately, eh, I’ve been loving a little extra sleep. 4. What decade has the best clothes? I’m probably biased because I wish I could go back to 1998 at least once a day, but[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 877 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

Would you rather listen to the radio or replay a favorite album? Replay a favorite album. Speaking of that, my family will probably freak out if I play the greatest hits from Fleetwood Mac one more time. 3. Have you ever had a job where you had to be on your feet all day? Yup. I’ve done retail and worked in the back of the house in a bakery. Gotta have supportive shoes! 4. Do you have any travel plans for the summer?
