Adapted from the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob, the film would eventually go on to inspire a TV series in 2020 that ran for several seasons. If you want to experience the source material, you can pick up the original Snowpiercer graphic novels in a bundle that includes all three books in hardcover format and three unique art cards for $60.22 (was $80) at Amazon.Snowpiercer was Bong's English language debut, and the South Korean filmmaker has since gone on to make several more critically acclaimed movies, including the dark comedy Parasite, which won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020, making the first non-English language film to win that category. Some of his other films include the crime thrillers Memories of Murder and Mother, the 2006 monster movie The Host, and the sci-fi adventure film Okja. Despite the variety of genres he's explored, all of Bong's films feature similar themes of environmentalism and class conflict. If you're interested in diving into his work, several of his movies are available at Amazon, including multiple Criterion Collection editions.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

From the main story campaign to side bosses to an endless endgame, you're certainly getting your money's worth by participating in early access. Some players could find hundreds of hours of gameplay in Path of Exile 2 just through the game's initial content.However, if you're trying to gauge exactly how much time you have to spend in Path of Exile 2 before \"beating it,\" that's another story. Below, you can find how long it takes to beat Path of Exile 2, how long it takes to reach the endgame, and a full quest list so you can track your progress.How long to beat Path of Exile 2Since Path of Exile 2 is an ARPG, you can never truly \"beat it.\" Most ARPGs follow a similar structure of progressing through a main campaign that's followed by the endgame. The endgame is what you make of it and you could spend however much time you want with a given character participating in endgame content.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Where would you rather go on vacation: New Zealand, Alaska, Costa Rica or Switzerland? I’d love to go to all of these places, but right now Switzerland sounds pretty cool. 2. Ponytail or curls? Hmm. I like ponytails because they’re functional, but sometimes they give me a headache, so let’s go with curls. They’d have to be super loose ones, though. And kinda messy! 3. Did you ever have a job where you had to wear a uniform? Kinda. We had very specific guidelines for safety when I worked at the bakery, like close-toed shoes, no nail polish, hair tied back. 4. If you were in school, whom would you likely hang out with: the athletes, the drama crew, the band kids or the honors society?

Folks getting their tree (we did today!), putting up the Christmas lights (workin’ on it!), other decorations. I was looking back at December posts over the years, and when I came upon this one it made me smile. 🙂 Mt. Saint Tabby? That was SO Tabs. It was a quiet morning on our hill today. Nothing really exciting happened, except for some joggers running by, which made a certain someone’s tail poof up… While Tabs checked out the usual blades of grass, plants and trees, I spent some time thinking about how possessive and jealous Tabs gets now in his older age. And not just with his humans. He’s also like that with his domain outside. I may or may not have received a Post-It last week asking me to write the city about renaming our hill, “Mt. Saint Tabby,” because Tabs doesn’t like the thought of anybody, and by “anybody,” I mean any other cats, chilling on his hill.
