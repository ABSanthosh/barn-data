    "description": "[UPDATE] The PlayStation Network is back online and operating normally. Sony said players should now be able to access online services \"without any problems.\" The downtime began on Friday, February 7, and lasted for nearly 24 hours, with services being restored on the evening on February 8. This makes it the second-longest PSN outage ever, only surpassed by the infamous 2011 PSN outage that lasted weeks.\"Sorry for the inconvenience,\" Sony said in its update announcing the restoration of online services. The company did not originally say why the PSN went down in the first place, prompting fans to wonder and speculate.But the company eventually stated that an \"operational issue\" led to the downtime. The vagueness of that statement isn't doing much for fans, though, who continue to ask Sony to provide more specifics as to what happened and what measures the company might enact to help prevent something like this from happening again.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "It’s the Super Bowl! As you know, before Tabs rocked the world by reinventing kitty supermodeling, he entertained millions as a professional cat football player. In fact, he won the Kitty Bowl a record eight times, making him more accomplished than even Tom Brady. Yes, Tabs was quite the cat athlete. Today’s game starts in a few minutes, and while Tabs is no longer here to watch the game with me, I’m sure he’ll be watching from up above. This happens to also be the last Sunday before Valentine’s. Marnie and Rosie are both more interested in that aspect of the day than the football. I can appreciate that. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What would you rather do on a rainy day: go to the movies with a friend, cozy up at home with a good book and a cup of tea, or go on an adventurous and fun (and very wet) hike? Right now movies with a friend sounds like it would be fun! Of course we’d have to have all the snacks – popcorn, M\u0026Ms and bubbly water. 2. What game show would you absolutely dominate: Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy or The Price Is Right? I’d have the best chances at The Price Is Right. Can’t say I’d dominate it, though. Hahaha! 3.
