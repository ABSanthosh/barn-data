Unsurprisingly, the first wave of preorders sold out fast at Amazon, but we'd expect it to come back, just like when the retailer listed the upcoming Link and Ganondorf figures. Amazon initially priced the Zelda Figma at $95, whereas Crunchyroll is currently taking preorders for $115 (still in stock). Preorder at Crunchyroll Preorder at Amazon The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Figma lineup now includes all Zelda, Ganondorf, and Link, who is getting a Deluxe version, too.

    "description": "Barring a DLC release, it can often be years before players learn what happens to their favorite characters after a video game story reaches its end. But for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 players, it's only going to take three months before they discover the fate of Titus. That's because Saber Interactive has confirmed that Prime Video's new video game anthology, Secret Level, will feature an episode that is a direct sequel to Space Marine 2.As reported by Warhammer Community, Clive Standen is reprising his role as Space Marines and Space Marines 2 hero Lieutenant Titus for a story that will take place after the events of his most recent game. Additionally, that episode was directed by Secret Level executive producer Dave Wilson, who has a long history with Warhammer 40,000. Wilson worked on one of the first Warhammer animated sequences for the opening of Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War in 2004.\"Returning to this universe feels like coming home, and it's been a deeply personal homecoming,\" Standen told Warhammer Community. \"Being part of something as vast and beloved as Warhammer is both a privilege and a responsibility. These worlds, these characters--they don't belong to me or to anyone else out here in LA who borrows them for an ephemeral moment. They belong to the teams in the creative dens and factory floors in Nottingham, who share what they build with a passionate fanbase that has kept this universe thriving for four decades. All I hope is that we've made them and you proud.\"Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Are you contemplating any limited edition holiday makeup releases? I usually prefer products in the permanent collections because in my experience holiday makeup performs differently for whatever reason. I do love a holiday fragrance set, though! 2. Are BB creams worth your time? My answer was no back in the day, but now that I’m into minimal base, I’m thinking it could be good if I find one that agrees with my skin. Hmm, maybe that will be my next makeup project – finding “the one.” I stumbled onto this one by Dr. Jart and it looks pretty good. 3. Your favorite video game? It’s all about old school Tetris on a Gameboy, baby! 4.Advice you wish you would’ve received as a young person?

    "description": "Gangstalk is a cat-and-mouse game in which you play both cat and mouse. It's a stalking game in which you are the person stalking you and also, you are the person being stalked.

Valve designers Lawrence Yang and Yazan Aldehayyat have shared a little of the company's thinking regarding \"generational leaps\" in hardware, commenting that they don't want to release a Steam Deck sequel that is \"only incrementally better\", and in particular, that they don't want to release a new Steam Deck that is drastically more powerful at the expense of battery life.
