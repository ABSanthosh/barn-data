    "description": "Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix kicks off on Saturday, and Epic Games finally revealed the new season on Friday night in an unusual way: with a Snoop Dogg concert in Times Square. It's only fitting for the man who is not only headlining Fortnite Festival Season 6, but who will also feature prominently in this new music-heavy retro season of battle royale. As has long been rumored, Fortnite Chapter 5 is wrapping up with a sequel to last year's OG season. Chapter 2 Remix will, as the name implies, focus on Chapter 2--specifically the first few seasons. The season will run for just a month, ending on the evening of November 30, and will bring with it the Remix Pass. The Remix Pass is shorter than a normal battle pass at just 70 tiers, and it includes five skins that are remixes of existing skins from early Chapter 2. That's one more skin than last year's OG Pass included.Each week of the Remix season will focus on a different artist. Week 1 is Snoop, Week 2 is Eminem--complete with a new skin inspired by his Houdini music video get-up, Week 3 is Ice Spice, and the fourth and final week will feature a tribute to the late Juice WRLD. Each week will come with themed locations and weapons in battle royale, and new item shop skins for each of the artists. And to top it all off, a cel-shaded Juice WRLD skin will be given out for free to anyone who logs in on the final day of the season, November 30, when the Remix finale event will go down.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Launched on October 8, the Arcade1Up Limited-Edition Pac-Man Plus Deluxe Cabinet is now available for purchase at Amazon. Due to Arcade1Up labeling this particular Pac-Man cabinet a \"limited edition,\" it would appear that once Amazon sells out, Pac-Man Plus will be gone for good.If you don't have room for the Pac-Man Plus Deluxe Cabinet or want a more affordable way to play Pac-Man, Arcade1Up just released a new Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga Countercade.

So much so that a fog develops and out of the fog emerges a figure - it's me. I'm holding an M4A1 with an extended barrel and a vertical foregrip.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last Halloween costume you wore? Hmm, a couple years ago I was a panda! It was a low-effort panda though. LOL! 2. Best and worst Halloween candy? I used to love Snickers, but now I find them too sweet, so please give me all the Ghrirardelli Caramel Squares. As for the worst ones, I automatically toss the rolls of Smarties and anything licorice related. Blech! 3. Pick your Halloween nail color – orange or black? Black with a high shine top coat please. 4. Vampires or werewolves? I’d rather hang out with the werewolves. 5. Scariest Halloween movie? “The Shining” still freaks me out! Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon.[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 854 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "No one threw a Halloween shindig like Tabs — fancy cat costumes, spooky snacks, special appearances from top-tier talent, including Tabs. In fact, Heidi Klum stole the idea for her spooky soirees from him. Here’s a look back at a typical Halloween 🎃 and all the prep Tabs usually did. My Darlings, There’s an old saying in the plus-size kitty modeling world: “Go big or go home,” and I take that phrase to heart when it comes to hosting parties. I want my guests to be talking about them for years to come. Being a famous feline supermodel, I’ve hosted many Halloween shindigs in my time, and I have almost a decade of party-planning experience. In that vein, here are the four essential components of a successful feline Halloween party. 1. Invitations First things first — the invitations. In the digital age, e-vites and group invites via Facebook are acceptable; however, I’m a little old fashioned. I prefer paper invitations. Do what I do, and ask your assistant to design you a custom invite.
