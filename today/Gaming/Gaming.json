    "description": "Yes, the original version of Oblivion did not have any scruff in sight. No beards in the character creator and not a single mustache can be found in the enormous province of Cyrodiil. Adding beards to a handful of NPCs throughout the world doesn't change Oblivion's core experience. In fact, even with the facial hair and improved graphics, half of the characters I met during my adventure still looked unsettling. To some, this may be off-putting--especially when juxtaposed with the remaster's otherwise astounding visuals--but for me, Oblivion isn't Oblivion without some truly uncomfortable character models. It's all part of that \"charm\" that game director Todd Howard mentioned in the reveal stream.The folks at Virtuous seem to understand that trademark Oblivion \"charm,\" too, because the remaster keeps the best of the Bethesda jank intact while gently reworking some of Oblivion's more dated mechanics. Purists will certainly find things to nitpick, and first-timers may scratch their heads at some of the jank that was left in, but Oblivion Remastered feels like the most logical compromise. The visuals have been entirely recreated to take advantage of Unreal Engine 5, but the characters still don't look quite right. The attack animations have been redone, but the combat is still generally bad. The streamlined leveling mechanics retain the class system, but it's much harder to get soft-locked. The UI and menus have been consolidated and refreshed, but Oblivion's iconic map screen is identical to the original. For the most part, Oblivion Remastered manages to walk that thin line of familiarity and freshness.The biggest surprise is its presentation. Oblivion Remastered looks stunning. Virtuous and Bethesda Game Studios have taken advantage of Unreal Engine 5 and it is without a doubt the most technically impressive game Bethesda Game Studios has ever released. The dynamic lighting, vibrant skyboxes, broader color palette, and hyper-realistic textures give the remaster that current-gen AAA sheen that players expect. These enhancements extend to the character models as well, as NPCs are lavishly detailed. You can see the strands of hair on their freshly grown beards and the pores on their faces, but they're still a little uncanny. In most cases, the NPCs look even stranger when they open their mouths. There's a bizarre disconnect between the hyper-realistic visuals and the weird faces and dated facial animations. The thing is, that awkwardness is part of what makes Oblivion so special, and there's plenty of it in this remaster.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. How many lip products do you typically carry with you: 1-2, 3-5 or 5+? Lately, I’ve been pretty streamlined, so it’s usually one or two things – lipstick and a gloss! 2. What nail colors have you been into lately? Pale opaque baby blues. Perhaps I’m having a mid-’90s nostalgia moment, ha! Remember that baby blue nail polish by Hard Candy? I couldn’t get enough of it. 3. Which would you rather do: an afternoon outdoor picnic or late night stargazing? Afternoon picnic because I’m pretty sure I’d be too sleepy to stargaze late at night, hahaha! 4. Scrambled or sunny side up? Both! But if it’s scrambled, I’ve got to be the one making the eggs. I’m weirdly picky about my scrambled eggs.

One of Tabs’ little-known side hustles would have made him even MORE super popular around the neighborhood but, unfortunately, he had to keep his real identity under wraps. I mean, he wanted to promote it, but his contract with Easter Bunnies Inc. had an airtight NDA. So it was a pretty thankless job, but still…highly rewarding. As you can imagine, Easter was a favorite around here. All of us at Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC were always busy during that critical first quarter trying to maximize the company’s gravy quota, so by Easter we were worn out. That’s when Tabs would always decide on his spring goals, and when they were good, it definitely helped set the tone for the rest of the year. 😹 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 858 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Last year, Ubisoft announced that both The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest would be getting offline modes, something quite likely driven (pun intended) by how upset people were by the original The Crew being shut down completely. There's an ongoing lawsuit over the first game and all! Still, The Crew 2 and Motorfest getting an offline mode is something, and there's a playtest for the former coming next week, April 30th.
