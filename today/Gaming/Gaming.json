This 1,445-piece Lion King Lego set is on sale for a best-ever price of $64.39 (was $130) for Target Circle members. To get the deal, you simply need to sign up for the free rewards program.On Target's site, Young Simba looks like a 30% discount due to the retailer listing the MSRP as $92, but Lego's actual retail price for Young Simba is $130, which means you're saving over 50% with this deal. Amazon and Walmart are offering the 20% discount that drops the price to $92, but needless to say, you should grab Target's deal before it sells out. It's unlikely to remain in stock for the full sale, which ends July 12 and is competing with Amazon Prime Day 2025 this week.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

This compiles all of the collected texts into a trio beautifully illustrated hardcover books. The Skyrim Library is available at Amazon for a dragon-sized discount right now.As part of Amazon's early Prime Day 2025 book sale, Elder Scrolls fans can get this $110 collection for only $44.79.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you have a favorite vegetable? Yes! Carrots, for sure. The fact that you can turn them into a cake is a big deal! I mean, come on, have you ever heard of a broccoli cake? Or an okra cake? Yeah, I didn’t think so, LOL! I also love that you can put them in salads, roast them or just eat them plain with a variety of different dips. 2. A song that’s been stuck in your head lately? “Top of the World” by The Carpenters has been on repeat in my car. 3. Something you’ve been avoiding lately? Social media and the news cycle in general. 4. Lip masks: yes or no? Yes, but only if we’re talking Laneige. 5.

    "description": "This time of year, Tabs was always pretty stoked about showing off his summer bod, which as you know, was curvy, Rubenesque and voluptuous. With this being the official weekend of the summer solstice, this morning I asked Rosie if she had any big plans for summer, and she just stared at me blankly and meowed something under her breath that sounded like “science waits for no one.” I took that as a “no.” 😂 Marnie’s sure been enjoying these longer summer days. In fact, she insists on waking me up at the crack of dawn so that she can go running with me, and by running I mean sprinting circles around me as I shuffle along… I believe she thinks that I am her sheep. 🐑 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 865 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
