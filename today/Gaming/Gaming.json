    "description": "While a few other guns in Destiny 2's Episode: Revenant stand out a bit more, like Exuviae and Liturgy, the adaptive frame Arc pulse rifle Vantage Point you can get from the episode is pretty good, too. Its god roll makes it a well-rounded weapon in PvE in particular, and can work well with Arc builds focused on delivering Jolt to enemies to keep them electrified while keeping yourself Amplified.Table of Contents [hide]How To Get Vantage PointHow To Get Vantage PointRight now, Revenant weapons can be earned by playing the episode's main attraction, the wave-based Onslaught: Salvation mode. Revenant guns, including Vantage Point, are random drops you can get after completing certain waves and earning reward chests.However, the gear that comes out of those chests is random, so while you might get Vantage Point, you might pull other weapons or armor, as well. The best way to get the guns you want is to \"attune\" your rewards using Revenant's Tonics system. You can craft and use Enrichment tonics that will increase the chance of getting certain drops when playing Onslaught: Salvation, making it a little easier to get the guns and rolls you want. Check out our Tonics guide for more.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "In 2020, Microsoft launched Xbox Cloud Gaming and allowed players to stream titles from the Xbox Game Pass library. But not every game was available on Game Pass, which put limits on which titles could be accessed. Now, Microsoft is reportedly planning to expand its streaming offerings to include games that aren't a part of Xbox Game Pass, as long as they're owned by the players themselves.According to The Verge, Microsoft is planning to begin testing this new option on the Xbox Cloud Gaming servers with Xbox Insiders as soon as next month. The report notes that Microsoft has been building towards this moment for some time by upgrading the capabilities of Xbox Cloud Gaming to handle thousands of games. But the company has to be sure that those expanded capabilities will hold up under pressure before rolling them out to Game Pass subscribers.Earlier this week, Xbox confirmed that as of November, players will be able buy or play Xbox games on Android via the Xbox app. And once the new streaming option becomes available, purchases on Android will immediately be available to stream no matter which devices players are using. As part of Epic Games' lawsuit win over Google, Microsoft will be able to sidestep Google Play and avoid giving the company a cut of its sales.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last person who complimented you on your makeup? My coworker last week. I was wearing a little more coverage than usual, so I think the overall look was more polished than the bare bones FOTDs I’ve been wearing for months now. Amazing what a difference a little bit of concealer makes! 2. Last dream you can remember? Marnie and I were like the Scooby Doo detectives in our neighborhood, ha ha ha! We were working a case to unveil who had stolen all the tuna sandwiches in our circle. 3. Today the temperature in my neighborhood is/was ____. The Bay Area is experiencing a heat wave, ugh! It’s supposed to hit 94. I’m so over it. 4. Your cookie of choice? Lately I’ve been obsessed with snickerdoodles.[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 851 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Rosie soaked up the last bits of summery weather today. She enjoyed basking underneath the trees, which still have leaves on them (but not for long). Among the many things she contemplated were cold fusion, a better way to produce nutritionally dense cat treats, how Marnie the dog is slowly ruining her life, and most importantly, what she’ll wear for Halloween. Unlike Tabs, who loved elaborate costumes, Rosie likes to keep it simple and chic. I asked if she needed any help brainstorming, but all I got were slow blinks and a tum flash in return. When it got too hot to be outside, Rosie made her way back indoors. I couldn’t help but notice her ignoring Marnie… I suspect Rosie’s afraid of Marnie rocking a costume that will steal Rosie’s thunder. Marnie, on the other hand, hasn’t even begun to think about Halloween. She started Marathoning Gilmore Girls this weekend, and she’s currently obsessed.
