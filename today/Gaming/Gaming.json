    "description": "Viture Pro XR/AR Glasses $399 (was $459) See at Amazon (Lightning Deal) See at Amazon (Coupon Deal) Amazon has a great deal on the Viture Pro XR/AR Glasses that drops the price to $399, which matches the lowest price yet for the impressive extended reality glasses. If you're unfamiliar with XR technology, Viture Pro Glasses are essentially wearable 1080p projectors. You can connect the glasses to your PC, smartphone, tablet, or game consoles to enjoy a 135-inch personal display only you can see.Note: Amazon has two separate listings for the Viture Pro XR Glasses. One of the listings is an Amazon Lightning Deal for $399, while the other is marked at $459 with a $60-off coupon box. Regardless of which one you order from, you'll get the same pair of glasses, so make sure to check the other listing if the first listing you click is sold out. Viture Pro XR/AR Glasses $399 (was $459) The Pro XR Glasses are Viture's flagship model. We were quite impressed with their clarity and how easy they were to use when we reviewed them at launch last summer. Viture packed impressive tech in glasses that aren't much bulkier than normal eyewear. The simulated 135-inch display has a 120Hz refresh rate and up to 4,000 nits of brightness. The lenses do a great job of blocking out glare, allowing you to use them comfortably in different environments. The built-in speakers are serviceable, though like with most electronics, headphones or earbuds will offer a better audio experience.The Viture Pro XR Glasses offer a plug-and-play experience on portable devices such as Steam Deck, iPhones, and Android phones. We also really enjoyed our using the glasses with a PC, though your home setup for desktop computers and home consoles such as PS5 and Xbox Series X|S might make them to tricky to use without shifting stuff around.One accessory that helps with this process is the Viture Pro Mobile Dock. While the glasses can plug directly into most devices, they will only work on Nintendo Switch when connected to official dock. This Mobile Dock is a hybrid USB-C hub and battery pack, so it's useful for all devices, but especially if you want to use additional accessories or game on the go. If you're buying the Mobile Dock for Nintendo Switch, you'll also want to pick up the Mobile Dock Mount, which connects the dock to the back of the handheld.The Mobile Dock is on sale for $116 (was $129) with promo code VITURE10. The Mobile Dock is part of a larger Viture sale on Amazon that also includes the recently released Viture One Neckband speaker and the Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate C Wireless Controller, which has a translucent shell.Check out the list below for highlights from the Viture XR Glasses sale and Amazon's promotion page for more discounts.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which would you rather collect: vintage clothes or vintage furniture? I could do both, but if I could only pick one, I’d have to go with vintage clothes, mostly because I don’t have a big enough house to collect furniture pieces. Sigh! Oh, and also, I don’t want to worry about my furniture being beat up by the pets and the kids playing in my house, you know? 2. How good are you with keeping secrets? If you tell me something in confidence, it’s going to the grave with me, babe; however, I do have an exception policy. If I believe someone’s in danger, then I’m gonna say something. 3. Who’s the coolest Jennifer: Jennifer Hudson, Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Garner or Jennifer Coolidge?

    "description": "That little girl in the picture above turned nine years old today. Yup, today is Connor Claire’s ninth birthday! Wow. I remember that day up there like it was yesterday. Poor Tabs… He was slightly confused about the overall gist of the festivities. I think he thought it was a get-together to celebrate him. We didn’t want to burst his bubble, so we took a brief interlude to sing him the birthday song. “Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear tabby… Happy birthday to you!” 🙂 Connor Claire didn’t mind, and there was more than enough food, fun and love for everyone. It was kind of weird, but for the most part, Tabs wasn’t as social as he usually is. He spent most of the afternoon napping at the top of the stairs, away from the party.
