Lo-fi delight Tiny Life is already out in early access, and cosy contender Paralives arrives later this year. But first, there's South Korean development giant Krafton's InZoi - an ultra-slick, mega-budget spin on the classic life sim formula that mostly seems to be selling itself on its seamless worlds and glossy, photorealistic looks - but is that enough to usurp the genre king? Based on a half dozen hours or so with the game, I'm not so sure. Read more",

    "description": "InZoi, Krafton's life simulator that could serve as the first real competition for The Sims, is finally arriving in early access on March 27, but the party is starting a little bit early with the launch of inZoi Creative Studio, which allows players to try out the game's character creation and build mode tools in-depth before jumping into this new simulated world.While many aspects of inZoi will be very familiar to fans of The Sims, particularly as they design their characters, or \"Zois.\" But inZoi goes much further than The Sims in terms of how much you can customize your belongings, and it can be relatively easy to miss some of those options when you're trying the game out for the first time.There are two specific features we're going to highlight here: that you can craft your own clothing and furniture, and that you can apply your own custom textures and patterns to nearly anything. Essentially, these are mod tools built directly into the game's interface, with inZoi natively providing the means to create your own custom content.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What eye makeup products have been on repeat with you lately? Maybelline Lash Sensational Sky High Mascara (eh, it’s just OK), Stila Liquid Liner Micro Tip (it’s pretty good) and good ol’ Anastasia Brow Pencil. 2. How good are you about finding clothes that fit you well? I used to be OK at it, but now, I don’t really enjoy in-person shopping as much as I used to, so I don’t spend the time that one really needs to find the things that fit great.

    "description": "Tabs was a natural born optimist. He always saw the up side to everything, sought out the silver linings and took advantage of every opportunity to spread hope and joy. That might be why he liked holidays so much — because they were an opportunity to play Santa “Claws,” so to speak, and spread good tidings to everyone. Perhaps for the obvious reasons, St. Patrick’s Day was a fave.
