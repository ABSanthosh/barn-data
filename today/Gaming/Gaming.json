    "description": "Assassin's Creed games usually include a large open world, and Assassin's Creed Shadows is no exception. While there are familiar elements to the travel and exploration abilities in this game, Shadows is also going to allow its two leading characters, Naoe and Yasuke, to take some time to appreciate the beauty of nature by creating art.Ubisoft unveiled this feature during an extended explanation about how the game's exploration mechanics will work. Letting Naoe or Yasuke create art may not give them an edge in battle, but it's an activity that they find rewarding. Yasuke and Naoe will also have their own character-specific activities that they can do outside of quests and missions. For example, Yasuke can find experts who can teach him more about how to use his Kata, which gives his character special attack movies. On the other hand, Naoe's Kuji-kiri meditation will open up more of her backstory.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Kindle Colorsoft $230 (was $280) | Extra 20% off with trade-in See at Amazon Amazon's recently released Kindle Colorsoft is on sale for a substantial discount for the first time since its release last October. For a limited time, you can get Amazon's first full-color e-ink tablet for $230, down from $280. The Prime-exclusive discount gets even better if you have an eligible trade-in device. If you trade-in an old device--it doesn't need to be a Kindle--you'll save an additional 20%.If you want to take notes on your Kindle, Amazon has preowned Kindle Scribe ereaders in like-new condition for as low as $234. You can also secure steep discounts on Kindle Fire HD tablets. Kindle Colorsoft $230 (was $280) | Extra 20% off with trade-in The Kindle Colorsoft has a 7-inch full-color display, eight weeks of battery life, and a front light that automatically adjusts to your surroundings. If you enjoy saving passages in books, the Colorsoft has the added benefit of letting you highlight text in color, making it easier than ever to organize important sentences you want to return to later.Other notable features of the Colorsoft include support for wireless charging, no ads on the lock screen, and 32GB of storage. If you like reading by the pool or relaxing in the bath, the Colorsoft ereader is waterproof and carries an IPX8 water resistance rating, which means it can be fully submerged in water at a depth of 6.5 feet for up to 60 minutes.The biggest reason to pick up the Colorsoft is if you’re interested in making the jump to digital comic books and graphic novels. Its color display is leagues better for the format than black and white ereaders like the standard Kindle--and at $230, it’s easier to recommend. See at Amazon As mentioned, you can save even more with an eligible trade-in item. You'll automatically save an additional 20%, even if you send Amazon a cheap device like a Fire Stick. The 20% is calculated from the sale price, so in this case, you'll save an extra $46 simply for trading in any eligible device. At the moment, that means the Colorsoft's price drops to $184.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "For decades now, I’ve proudly proclaimed myself as a crazy cat lady, and last Saturday, I found my people at Mini Cat Town in San Rafael. Mini Cat Town is a non-profit adoption safe haven for kittens in the Santa Rosa Plaza, which is about 45 minutes north of where I live in Marin County. Cats roam freely in a big room and interact with cat lovers and potential adopters. To visit with the kitties, you pay a small fee to enter, and then you get 30 minutes to hang out and play. How I managed to leave without adopting a kitty or two or five or 10 is honestly a mystery to me, LOL! I was immediately drawn to a handsome orange tabby boy named Teddy! Just look at his face. He’s a super meow-dal, for sure. He was very sweet, fun and outgoing, and when I picked him up he immediately melted into my arms, just like Tabs used to do.
