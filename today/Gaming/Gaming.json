    "description": "Naruto: The Complete Series $271 at Amazon | $250 at Crunchyroll See at Amazon See at Crunchyroll Naruto: The Complete Series is now available to preorder at Amazon ahead of its January 7, 2025 release. The massive 32-disc Blu-ray box set collects all 220 episodes of Uzumaki Naruto's early adventures. At the moment, Amazon has the Naruto anime collection priced at $271, while Crunchyroll is taking preorders for $250. Amazon's price will likely drop ahead of launch, and you'll automatically get the lowest price offered from the time you order until the box set ships due to Amazon's preorder price guarantee. Additionally, you won't be charged until your order ships, whereas Crunchyroll charges for preorders immediately and doesn't offer a best-price guarantee. Naruto: The Complete Series is marked as a limited-edition release at Crunchyroll. Amazon's listing, at least as of October 26, doesn't note this specification, but the box sets are identical. With that said, Naruto fans may not want to wait too long to preorder, as it's unknown how \"limited\" this Blu-ray box set truly is.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Today, after a fierce fight on the sovereignty hub grid, where Goonswarm Federation unleashed a last gasp defense consisting of two fleets of unrigged Rifters (rigs?), Brave was able to prevail and take the system. The battle report showed a lopsided win in favor of Brave.  […]",

    "description": "Hiya and happy Saturday! How’s your week been? You know, I thought of you the other day when I put lipstick on right before work; it was MAC Sweet Deal, a mid-tone pink that looks like a neutral on my skin. Anywho, I wondered if you were still keeping up with wearing lip color all week long. I hope so! Even though I wasn’t adventurous with color, I’m happy to report I wore Sweet Deal all through the week. I grabbed it on Monday right before I brought Connor to school. We did a short presentation on Filipino History Month for all the grades in her elementary! You can kinda see it here in this pic one of her teachers took of us. 🙂 The presentation went well, and I think Connor was excited to share different things about Filipino history and culture. At the end we taught the kids some Tagalog words and phrases, and even though my American accent makes things sound a little wonky, I figured it was better than nothing, LOL![Continue reading...] The post Ghostly Adventures appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "I’ve lived in the Bay Area practically all of my life and had no idea that this gorgeous place existed. Fioli Historic House and Gardens is just about an hour away from where I live Marin county. It’s in the peninsula, south of San Francisco. Back in the day, it was a private residence, but now you can visit it and explore the mansion and the grounds. I went a couple weeks ago with my friends, Jen and Cindy; you might remember them from the MAC Evolution Revolution launch from waaaay back when. 🙂 We had tea at the cafe, explored the gardens and caught up. Sometimes I can’t believe that I used to talk to these two and see them every day. That’s one of the magical things of my childhood and teenage years that I didn’t fully understand the wonder of until I got older. To be able to say that I spent almost every day of my formative years with good friends was such a gift. Anywho, back to the gardens!
