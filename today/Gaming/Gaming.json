The Switch 2 is only compatible with Express cards, and since it's a newer technology, there aren't very many options in stores at the moment--and most of them are sold out. Samsung's 256GB Nintendo-themed card costs $60 and releases alongside the Switch 2 on June 5. Outside of this card, the only other option that's currently in stock is SanDisk's microSD Express Card in 128GB ($50) and 256GB ($72) capacities.Where to preorder Samsung's microSD Express Card for Switch 2 (Updated: May 16)Target -- In stockBest Buy -- In stockWalmart -- Sold outGameStop -- In stockThe Nintendo Switch 2 offers a fairly massive upgrade when it comes to raw storage space. The 256GB onboard SSD is four times larger than the Switch OLED (64GB) and eight times the size of the original Switch and Switch Lite (32GB). That said, the Switch 2's performance upgrades will inevitably lead to bigger file sizes for upcoming games, which could compel you to expand your console's storage capacity with one of the ultra-fast microSD Express Cards.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

May 18 is the last day the game will be available for download from Apple and Google's stores, and Activision has ended the ability of players to purchase Call of Duty points or Black Cell in the game \"effective immediately.\" Social features are also being retired.However, Activision said servers will still be available for players who have already downloaded the game--in essence, while you can't download Warzone Mobile after this weekend or buy anything in it, you'll still be able to play.

It takes place in a world where steel is a divine substance passed down to humanity by the mysterious Forgers. Some sinister young queen has, however, cast a spell that turns everybody else’s steel into stone, granting her followers a near-monopoly on all the butt-kicking. Playing as bleak and burly beardyman Aran “We Have Kratos At Home” de Lira, your job is to chase down that queen, murder her minions, and craft a whole bunch of Darksiders-esque weaponry. Aran is accompanied by Adso, a juvenile sidekick in the vein of Atreus, who catalogues the game’s “over 50” enemy types and can also translate lore written in the ancient Forger language. Read more",

When The Precinct's action ramps up and it transforms into a top-down blaster, it becomes ponderous and clunky, but its quieter moments of police pretending encourage a strict dedication to the role of petty rules enforcer. It's a game of quibbles and quirks, imperfect in many ways, but there's a sense of commitment underneath it all that I can respect. Even if I don't respect the badge itself. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What made you smile today? It’s early in the day (I just woke up 30 minutes ago), but so far petting Marnie and Rosie, and re-reading the homemade Mother’s Day card Connor made are two things that made me smile. 2. What’s the first thing you do when you get home and walk through the door? Hmmm, well, I want to say that I usually take off my shoes first thing because, hello, I need foot freedom (shoes are so oppressive), but I think what I technically do is lock the door behind me. 3. What’s your favorite cereal? Does oatmeal count? If it doesn’t then, it’s Kellogg’s Special K with the dried red strawberries. I don’t really eat it for breakfast, though.

    "description": "It’s almost dusk here at Casa de MBB, and we’re getting cleaned up and ready for bed, but I still wanted to wish you a Happy Mother’s Day. There’s so much to say about Mother’s Day, isn’t there? It can be an emotional day in many ways for many reasons, different for everyone. People have such different relationships with their parents and their children and all of the creatures they care for, and life is fleeting. We all lose our care givers and loved ones someday, and days like today mean different things to all of us at different times in our lives. I pray and hope your day was good to you. Every Mother’s Day, just like every other day, I also think about Tabs. Oh! — sometimes when I see an old picture like this one below, I tear up, especially on Mother’s Day.
