Bake brownies, and perhaps share those with the neighbors, too, when I drop off the chili. Go on a long hike, then come home and drink hot apple cider. Buy an epic pair of rain boots. Go for a walk with Marnie and stomp into a pile of leaves with those epic rain boots. Snuggle into a warm, cozy sweater that makes me feel amazing when I wear it. Side note, is it just me, or is it surprisingly difficult to find a sweater that fits well and ticks all the boxes? Every time I try one on, I find at least 5 things that I want to change.
