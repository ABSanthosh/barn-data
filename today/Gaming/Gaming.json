    "description": "There was a 22-year gap between the first Jumanji, and its 2017 sequel, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. So a seven-year gap between the third film, 2019's Jumanji: The Next Level, and the fourth movie isn't that bad by comparison. Now, Sony has set the date for the next Jumanji... which it's listing as \"Jumanji 3\"for now.Jumanji 3 will hit theaters on December 11, 2026. It's more than likely that the film's final title will forgo the 3 altogether, just as The Next Level was released without a 2 in its name. And while there are no other films listed as opening that weekend, Sony has chosen a date that's only a week before Dune Messiah and an untitled Star Wars movie. Given the lack of Star Wars movies in the last five years, it won't be shocking if that untitled Star Wars film is pushed to another date. But if Dune Messiah sticks around, there could be a franchise battle in late December 2026.According to Deadline, Jake Kasdan will return as the director, with Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson set to produce the sequel alongside Kasdan, Hiram Garcia, and Matt Tolmach. Johnson is reportedly also set to reprise his role Dr. Xander Bravestone. Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan are said to be in negotiations to return as well.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

That's sort of accurate, as it does come with the iconic slasher film on 4K Blu-ray, but it's actually a combo pack that exists because of the 2023 asymmetric multiplayer game. This special physical release for PS5 and Xbox Series X comes with a 4K Blu-ray of the legendary horror movie housed in a commemorative steelbook case and a pack of trading cards featuring characters from the game. See at Amazon The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 50th Anniversary Collector's Edition SteelbookThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre 50th Anniversary Collector's Edition costs $100.The steelbook case features exclusive artwork by renowned artist Gary Pullin, who is known for illustrating a substantial number of posters, covers, and other promotional materials for iconic horror films.

It's also a wonderful show of experimentation, switching genres from story to story - one minute you're a playable bestiary on shuffle, the next you're beheading fish in a cannery as the worktable disappears beneath your scrolling daydreams. The developer's next project seems to be pursuing a similar balance of whimsy and darkness. It's another anthology experience, which casts you as a field biologist studying \"the strangeness of organic life\". Also, chicken-legged houses. Read more",

Cats are too self-respecting to get caught up in silly online multiplayer party games. Please. Don't insult their intelligence, their divinity, their mastery of the environment and of your emotions. Cats don't need 2-9 player scrambles across the rooms of an eccentric manor house, with customisable outfits and various minigames. What? Jumping Jazz Cats? No. I won't recognise it. This is a work of impossible sedition. Impossible, cute sedition. Pay no attention to the trailer below. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last Halloween costume you wore? Hmm, a couple years ago I was a panda! It was a low-effort panda though. LOL! 2. Best and worst Halloween candy? I used to love Snickers, but now I find them too sweet, so please give me all the Ghrirardelli Caramel Squares. As for the worst ones, I automatically toss the rolls of Smarties and anything licorice related. Blech! 3. Pick your Halloween nail color – orange or black? Black with a high shine top coat please. 4. Vampires or werewolves? I’d rather hang out with the werewolves. 5. Scariest Halloween movie? “The Shining” still freaks me out! Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon.[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 854 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "No one threw a Halloween shindig like Tabs — fancy cat costumes, spooky snacks, special appearances from top-tier talent, including Tabs. In fact, Heidi Klum stole the idea for her spooky soirees from him. Here’s a look back at a typical Halloween 🎃 and all the prep Tabs usually did. My Darlings, There’s an old saying in the plus-size kitty modeling world: “Go big or go home,” and I take that phrase to heart when it comes to hosting parties. I want my guests to be talking about them for years to come. Being a famous feline supermodel, I’ve hosted many Halloween shindigs in my time, and I have almost a decade of party-planning experience. In that vein, here are the four essential components of a successful feline Halloween party. 1. Invitations First things first — the invitations. In the digital age, e-vites and group invites via Facebook are acceptable; however, I’m a little old fashioned. I prefer paper invitations. Do what I do, and ask your assistant to design you a custom invite.
