    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/civilization-7-best-legacy-to-pick-in-every-age/2900-6239/",
    "description": "Civilization 7 is a game made up of decisions. From deciding where to send your units to picking a new civic to research, you're constantly making decisions at every turn. One of the earliest choices you have to make at the start of every new age in Civilization VII is picking between one of the four Legacies. This is done through choosing a specific advisor.Legacies are essentially ways for you to track how you're performing in every age. The four Legacies are: Militaristic, Cultural, economic, and Scientific. Every Legacy carries with it different attributes and objectives per age and you can advance them by building specific structures and performing actions throughout the entirety of Civilization 7. However, when you start a new age, it can be a little daunting to pick a new Legacy, as you don't know what lies in front of you.Fortunately, we've played enough Civ 7 to know what Legacies work best for all three ages. Below, you can see our advice for what Legacy to pick for the Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern Ages. Best Legacy for the Antiquity Age The Legacy you start with in Civ 7 is arguably the most important, as it can determine how your playthrough pans out across all three ages. While you can, of course, choose a Legacy to start and then go on a different path after that, sticking with the main Legacy you pick will offer the most cohesive process. In the Antiquity Age, our Legacy recommendation is to focus on the Scientific Legacy. Picking the Science Advisor and opting to build structures focused around this Legacy will get your civilization off to the best start possible. You'll be able to hone in on specific Technologies and Civics that allow your empire to become more advanced than others around you. The Science Legacy offers the Greay Library to start in the Antiquity Age, which allows you to place more Codexes that uplift your civilization in the next ages. One other major factor in choosing the Science Legacy is a higher Science number in your civilization allows you to produce units much quicker. In cities, the turns it takes to produce units is mostly dependent on its Science, so having a higher number cuts down on the number of turns dramatically. This makes it so your cities can get off the ground much faster, which is highly important in the early going during the Antiquity Age. Best Legacy for the Exploration AgeNext up we have the Exploration Age, which is all about setting sail into the open ocean and exploring the other continents of the world. You can start to construct naval units, meet new leaders from distant lands, and start to experience other cultural elements, such as religion.While there are two solid Legacies to choose from during the Exploration Age, we're picking the Economic Legacy. There's a case to be made for the Military Legacy, as you want to dominate other settlements on distant lands so you can take some control. However, the Economic Legacy allows you to set up your civilization for the third and final age. Using the Economic Advisor's recommendations, you can start bringing in more gold than you ever have before. This is done primarily through constructing specific buildings and establishing trade routes to settlements all across the map.The Economic Legacy will also allow you to expand and build more settlements without engaging in war with other leaders, which you may or may not be ready for. Basically, since the Exploration Age is about exploring the map, you want to ensure your civilization can sustain itself and expand before trying to dominate every tile. Best Legacy for the Modern Age And finally, we arrive at the Modern Age in Civilization VII. This age will likely start with the map mostly uncovered and feature more civilization names that you recognize. You'll presumably have met all possible leaders in your playthrough, have set relationships with them, and are looking at an empire that features close to or over 10-15 settlements. Through the course of two ages, you should have a fairly large military complete with Army Commanders and units as well plenty of naval units to navigate the seas with. All that said, the best Legacy for the Modern Age is the Military Legacy. The Modern Age is your last gasp before the end of the playthrough, so you want to make it count. Trying to take over the entire map is a realistic goal if you have the forces and defenses for it, so going with the Military Advisor's recommendations will help make that happen. There's also no real point in keeping friendly relationships with more than one or two other leaders, so you might as well invade their lands to take as many settlements as you can. In the Modern Age, your military units are the strongest they've ever been, your towns and cities are well-fortified, and you have a flowing supply of gold, Influence, and other resources to rely on. There's nothing else to do besides trying to totally dominate the map and establish as many footholds as possible. The Military Advisor will also lead you on the path to flight, which opens up entirely new doors in combat. Lastly, the Military Legacy offers some of the best endings possible in Civ 7. From researching the Manhattan Project to producing a Nuclear Weapon, there are plenty of fun and explosive ways to end the game if you follow the Military Legacy.There's so much to learn and discover when you're exploring the massive world of Civ 7. Be sure to use our Civilization 7 guides hub to find all of our guides on the game in one spot.",

    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/civilization-7-best-pantheon-religious-beliefs-guide/2900-6238/",
    "description": "Some say religion is the opium of the masses, but at the very least it's a mechanic you need to master in Sid Meier's Civilization 7. Your decision during the Antiquity Age is crucial, and your actions during the Exploration Age help determine how you proceed in the campaign. Here's our guide that discusses the best Pantheon and religious beliefs in Civilization 7.What are the best religious beliefs and Pantheons in Civilization 7 - Religion guideIf you've played Civilization games in the past, then you'll soon realize that the Civilization 7 religion system isn't as intricate as before. That said, it's still an integral part of each run, specifically during the Antiquity Age and Exploration Age:Antiquity Age - You can choose your Pantheon, a bonus that remains in effect throughout the campaign.Exploration Age - You can pick your Reliquary Belief, Founder Belief, and Enhancer Belief. These are important, especially if you plan to engage with the Cultural Legacy path/milestone. Best PantheonYou can unlock a Pantheon in Civilization 7 during the Antiquity Age. To do this, you must first study the Mysticism civic. This can take you well over a dozen turns, which is why luck plays a huge role. If you can find goody huts that reward culture, then you should have a decent shot at grabbing the Pantheon that you want.In any case, the best Pantheon in Civilization 7 is good ol' Fertility Rites, which grants +10% growth rate in cities with an Altar. Everything else, when compared to it, feels extremely situational. How to found and spread your own religionLater during the Exploration Age, you can found your own religion. This is done by studying the Piety civic and then building a Temple in your settlements. When you found your own religion, you may also select one Reliquary Belief and one Founder Belief.Likewise, take note that you can train a Missionary in any settlement that has a Temple. Missionary units have \"Spread Religion\" charges. All you need to do is move them to another settlement to convert that place to your religion.Note 1: You may also recruit Missionaries from settlements without any religion or those that another civ converted to their religion. The only important thing is that the settlement has a temple. For example, you can forward-settle a town close to another civ, buy a Temple using gold, and then buy Missionaries so they can start converting your opponent's territories.Note 2: Converting a settlement's population depends on the tile where you used the \"Spread Religion\" action. A good example is how large cities have separate urban and rural population. If you want to fully convert a city to your cause, then you need to use the action on (a) an urbanized district, and (b) a rural district, such as a mine or a farm. Best Reliquary BeliefThe Reliquary Belief you choose is very important, since it determines how you obtain holy relics whenever your Missionaries convert settlements. Similar to the Pantheon decision, we feel that there's only one viable option here: Icons.The Icons Reliquary Belief grants +2 relics whenever you convert a city-state for the first time. Depending on the map size, you're likely to discover half a dozen or so city-states across multiple continents. All that's left is to send out your Missionaries so you can have as many relics as you need. Best Founder BeliefsAmong the Founder Beliefs in Civilization 7, we suggest the following options:Interfaith Dialogue: +4 science for every foreign settlement following your religion.Tithe: +4 gold for every foreign settlement following your religion.Other choices are more terrain-based, and we feel that they're extremely situational or unnecessary. That said, two options provide powerful boons, but they're dependent on how the other civs have progressed:Stewardship: +8 culture, gold, and science for every tile that has a natural wonder in other civs' settlements following your religion.Shrines of the Kami: +4 culture, gold, and science for every wonder in other civs' settlements following your religion.Generally speaking, if an opposing civ has built several wonders, or if they have natural wonders in their realm, then they already have a huge advantage. However, Stewardship and Shrines of the Kami might help you catch up due to their bonuses. Best Enhancer BeliefsTo unlock Enhancer Beliefs, you need to study the Theology civic. You'll then be able to select from several available options. Here are our recommendations:Stella Maris: +2 movement to Missionaries when embarked; all naval units and embarked units gain +1 movement. This is great for exploring the rest of the world and conquering new lands.Conversion: Newly-founded towns in distant lands (i.e. other continents) start with this religion in place.Defender of the Faith: +5 combat strength in friendly settlements that follow your religion. This is a decent choice if you need to defend your realm.Dawah: Establishing a trade route to a settlement automatically converts it to your religion. This is a viable pick if you're creating multiple trade routes, since you won't need to send your Missionaries to those locations.That does it for our guide on the best religious beliefs and Pantheons in Civilization 7. Once the Exploration Age is over, you won't be engaging with this system anymore, assuming you're still going for a Cultural Victory. That's because you need to excavate artifacts using Explorers in the next era.Explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate your way to victory with the help of our Sid Meier's Civilization 7 guides hub.",

Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. In Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a \"weaver band\", a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What would you rather do on a rainy day: go to the movies with a friend, cozy up at home with a good book and a cup of tea, or go on an adventurous and fun (and very wet) hike? Right now movies with a friend sounds like it would be fun! Of course we’d have to have all the snacks – popcorn, M\u0026Ms and bubbly water. 2. What game show would you absolutely dominate: Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy or The Price Is Right? I’d have the best chances at The Price Is Right. Can’t say I’d dominate it, though. Hahaha! 3. Do you wear more makeup now or less makeup than you did a year ago? I wear a little less these days, but that’s mostly[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 867 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "It has rained for almost a week! I’m getting kinda over it, but Tabs sure would have loved it. That cat LOVED the rain. His favorite thing about it? Rainbows. 🌈 Mind you, I also like the rain. But Tabs didn’t just like the rain. He loved it! I think what he liked about it was all the movement. My theory is that with his heightened cat senses, he could actually track the falling of individual raindrops. Rosie, however, is not a big fan of rain. In fact, she doesn’t particularly enjoy anything about it. Scratch that — I’m mistaken. There is one thing about rain she agrees with Tabs on. Rainbows are fantastic! 🌈😺 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 849 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
