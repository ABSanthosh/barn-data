    "description": "A low-quality video of what appears to be a Nintendo Switch 2 has emerged, prompting fan speculation over the as-yet-unseen console and the validity of this footage.The video was posted on Chinese video site Bibli and was first spotted by Nintendo Soup (via Kotaku). The footage appears to show someone removing a joycon from the side of the Switch 2 screen by simply pulling it off. The controllers themselves seem to sport infrared sensors (on both the left and right joycons) and bigger shoulder buttons. This matches previous leaks, which suggested that the Switch 2 would have magnetic joycons and a more complex controller layout, though it would also maintain the same basic design as the original Switch. However, the blurry footage could be fake, and feature a version of the console constructed using information from prior leaks.Edited video by me (since the original video is 5+ minutes long)We can also see the man de-attaching the Joy-Cons at the beginning of the video pic.twitter.com/RtIVDQJOlX — Adrien190303 #ThankYouToriyama (@Adrien190303) December 2, 2024 Details about the upcoming console are still scant. Nintendo has confirmed that an official announcement of the Switch 2 will arrive before April 2025. The console was previously rumored to release in 2024, but reports early this year claimed it had been delayed. The Switch 2 specs are still up in the air, though a Digital Foundry report claimed that the system would use an Nvidia custom T239 processor. Nintendo recently confirmed that the successor will be backwards compatible. Nintendo Switch Online will also carry over to the new system. At least one game has already been announced for the upcoming console.",

    "description": "PlayStation Portal - 30th Anniversary Edition $220 See at PlayStation Direct The 30th Anniversary PlayStation consoles and accessories were restocked at various retailers today for Cyber Monday. While most of these restocks sold out immediately, the 30th Anniversary PlayStation Portal handheld is still available for $220 via PlayStation Direct. PlayStation Portal - 30th Anniversary Edition $220 PlayStation Direct is the official PlayStation retail portal, so you're getting the device directly from Sony. PS Direct requires you to sign in with your PSN account before you can buy. All orders are eligible for free standard shipping. See at PlayStation Direct The PlayStation Portal is a handheld device used for streaming gameplay directly from your PS5 over Wi-Fi. The device does not play games natively. Design-wise, it looks like a DualSense PS5 controller with an 8-inch LCD screen. The Portal supports DualSense features like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback and can stream gameplay at up to 1080p resolutions and 60fps. Like other 30th Anniversary PlayStation devices, this version of the Portal features a gray color scheme and colored face buttons that resemble the original PlayStation 1 console and its DualShock controller.Stocks are limited, and given how popular all the 30th Anniversary consoles and accessories are, chances are the Portal will sell out soon. If you've been considering buying one, now is the time.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

I have never been more grateful for this recurrent Quixotic daydream's mass market failure than when watching trailers for Urge, an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss. \"But hold your horses, young Edwin,\" you sternly interject. \"I do not wish to hear about, let alone play an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss, on a website that children might read. It sounds like a cheap, taboo-jabbing gimmick.\" Friend, I once thought as you. But then I did a little research, as is my journalistic responsibility, and it turns out Urge's notions about piss - bladdergold, as they call it in the West Country, or Crusoe Cola, as it's known in the States - are rather in-depth. I'm still very glad I can't smell the game, but I definitely have the urge to play it. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. A habit that changed your life? Getting up early. For most of my life I was a night owl, and when I had Connor that all changed. When she was an infant, I started waking up at the crack of dawn to sneak in work before she woke up in the morning. The habit ended up sticking, and now I’m an early bird. 2. Fruit or cupcakes? As much as I love a small cake smothered in frosting, I’m gonna have to go with fruit. 3. Are you doing any advent calendars this year? At Trader Joe’s a couple weeks ago, I picked up a few for the “kids” – Connor, Rosie and Marnie. Ha ha ha! 4. Something on your Christmas list?

    "description": "Jeez! It’s December already? Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! Rosie is NOT ready. Tabs handled the holidays differently. He was a total pro about it, planned everything out months in advance. His Christmas plans were always well underway by August. But Rosie didn’t even begin to take Christmas seriously until this weekend, and now she’s frantic! Wait — did I say frantic? 😂 I meant “totally uninterested and really fantastic.” Seriously, she isn’t bothered about it at all. She has three PhDs and a feline Nobel Prize. Rosie spends her days researching climate change and nuclear fusion. She isn’t worried about planning for Christmas. I’m sure she’ll pull something amazing together in the last few days. #bosskitty Marnie, on the other hand, has no idea what’s going on. 😂 Deputy Derp, reporting for duty!
