    "description": "Way back in the day, the original Mass Effect was my favorite video game. I played it more than a dozen times before Mass Effect 2 came out, eager to immerse myself in BioWare's slick new space opera and its cosmic mysteries. I was pretty young back then in 2007, still a college kid who wasn't old enough to legally drink alcohol, and a longtime Star Wars nerd dealing with how much I hated the prequel movies. Mass Effect hit the spot.Cut to a couple decades later. I've just finished reading a series of novels, dubbed the Revelation Space series after the first book, by Welsh author Alastair Reynolds. In the early Aughts, Reynolds released a trilogy of these books along with a standalone side novel, a prequel novel, a pair of novellas, and a bunch of short stories. All of these works were set in his own original and extremely weird science-fiction universe that seems to have been extraordinarily influential on the games industry. Having now read them, it's difficult not to see the way that some of Reynolds' best and strangest ideas made their way into all sorts of games--Stellaris, Destiny, Dead Space, Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect are some that immediately spring to mind.I myself finally got around to reading these books because they are commonly accepted as inspiration for Mass Effect's Reapers. In Mass Effect, the Reapers are a race of ancient machines who periodically pop up to wipe out any galactic civilization that may have risen up. In Revelation Space, published in 2000, we instead have the Inhibitors, a race of ancient machines who periodically pop up to wipe out any galactic civilization that may have risen up. While sci-fi writers have always loved their ancient space civilizations, these are too specifically similar to ignore.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Pick one: colorful shoes or a colorful sweater? Let’s go with the colorful shoes. Life is too short for boring footwear! 2. Which would you rather never have to deal with again: nosy neighbors, parallel parking, burnt food or washing your makeup brushes? Once, I caught a neighbor going through our trash. So I could do without the nosy neighbors, LOL! 3. Have you ever crimped your hair? Yes, but sadly, I never got to do it in the ‘80s (I was too young and missed all the cool stuff). 4. Who does the grocery shopping in your household? Mostly me, but El Hub will do it if he has extra time and/or if I’m busy with Connor doing extracurriculars. 5. Liquid liner: yes or no?

    "description": "(NOVATO) Today in cat science news! Rosie brought the full force of her four PhDs in science to solve a canine conundrum. The dilemma? Well, she started a dog training service, and she’s been trying to train Marnie, but sadly, it has not gone well. Rosie, being the cat genius she is, figured out that the key to making Marnie more receptive to instruction is to wear her out. To that end, Rosie got to work. From her lab at the Cat Academy of Sciences, she developed a new cutting edge treadmill that automatically adjusts its speed to efficiently tire out a canine jogger. So far, results have been good. Marnie has been jogging on the treadmill for 24 straight hours. At this rate, it looks like she might — might — start to get tired in a few days. 🙂 Hard to say, though. Marnie is on the track team at the University of Derp, so she has pretty incredible endurance.
