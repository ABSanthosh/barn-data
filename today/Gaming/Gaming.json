    "description": "Parkour has been an important part of the Assassin's Creed franchise from the beginning, but Assassin's Creed Shadows will be making some adjustments to the acrobatic running style. Ubisoft has already hinted that Naoe--one of Shadows' new leading characters--can Naruto run in the game. But that's just the beginning of what she can pull off while running.Ubisoft has shared an extensive breakdown of Shadow's new parkour options, as well as the revised button map for the game. One of the most notable changes is that the crouch and the dodge buttons have traded places. That will allow the player to either crouch or lie in a prone position. Naoe can even kill her targets while lying prone. Yasuke--the game's other lead character--and Naoe can both perform dodges while crouched, but only the latter can pull off a dodge in her prone stance. The other new parkour moves that Naoe can pull off include a wall-run eject and a backward dodge, which you can see below.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Their wholly owned subsidiaries including League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear Games, and UK outfit Sumo Group. They own shares in everything from Epic Games through Ubisoft to Silent Hill 2 rebooters Bloober Team. Are you a game developer? Odds are that at least one percent of your body belongs to Tencent. Maybe one of your toes. And now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that's what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they've just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL. This potentially makes it difficult for Tencent to do business in the States, but Tencent say that it's all based on a \"misunderstanding\". Read more",

If you could eat one food all day long, what would it be? Popcorn! If left to my own devices, I could easily have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 2. Who in your life is most like you? To be honest, probably my dog, Marnie. 3. Your current favorite store? Ooh, girl. You know you’ve crossed a bridge when you no longer want to hang out at Sephora or Nordstrom anymore. LOL!

But his goals weren’t always epic. Sometimes, they were something simple… My darlings, The new year is upon us, and, with that, many new year’s resolutions. I was talking to a few kitty friends of mine, and one resolution that always pops up is getting fit.
