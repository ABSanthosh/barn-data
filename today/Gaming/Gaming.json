In those conditions Horde players get […]",

    "description": "I’ve lived in the Bay Area practically all of my life and had no idea that this gorgeous place existed. Fioli Historic House and Gardens is just about an hour away from where I live Marin county. It’s in the peninsula, south of San Francisco. Back in the day, it was a private residence, but now you can visit it and explore the mansion and the grounds. I went a couple weeks ago with my friends, Jen and Cindy; you might remember them from the MAC Evolution Revolution launch from waaaay back when. 🙂 We had tea at the cafe, explored the gardens and caught up. Sometimes I can’t believe that I used to talk to these two and see them every day. That’s one of the magical things of my childhood and teenage years that I didn’t fully understand the wonder of until I got older. To be able to say that I spent almost every day of my formative years with good friends was such a gift. Anywho, back to the gardens!

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Are you contemplating any limited edition holiday makeup releases? I usually prefer products in the permanent collections because in my experience holiday makeup performs differently for whatever reason. I do love a holiday fragrance set, though! 2. Are BB creams worth your time? My answer was no back in the day, but now that I’m into minimal base, I’m thinking it could be good if I find one that agrees with my skin. Hmm, maybe that will be my next makeup project – finding “the one.” I stumbled onto this one by Dr. Jart and it looks pretty good. 3. Your favorite video game? It’s all about old school Tetris on a Gameboy, baby! 4.Advice you wish you would’ve received as a young person? I wish someone[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 853 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
