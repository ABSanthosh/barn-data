    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Mountains or desert? Mountains, ideally somewhere with a million shades of green and a river or a lake. Sure, my allergies will probably be crazy, but at least my heart will be happy. 2. Something you’re doing in 2025? Making decisions from a place of optimism and not fear. So often I needlessly worry about all the things that are involved and every little detail that could go wrong. I don’t want to be held back by fear anymore. Life is too short. 3. How easily do you cry? I’m 100% a crybaby. You know what, though? It’s not always because I’m sad. If I’m angry or frustrated or feeling anxious, my body releases whatever it needs to release through tears.

    "description": "Thank you for being a friend. Guess who just discovered The Golden Girls? When she’s not doing science, Rosie’s been watching reruns of one of my favorite shows ever. Now she’s trying to get Marnie into her little Golden Girls gang because Rosie’s obsessed with them. Marnie’s kinda into it, but to be honest, I don’t really think she knows what’s going on. 😹 Rosie is Sophia, and Marnie is Rose from St. Olaf (obviously). To complete the group, Rosie has been trying to find a good Dorothy and Blanche. She put something up on Nextdoor this morning, but she doesn’t have a lot of faith in the cats in the neighborhood. Do you happen to know any cats or dogs who’d fit the bill?
