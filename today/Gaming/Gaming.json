    "description": "Henry Cavill's days as the Man of Steel and Geralt of Rivia may be behind him, but he's got his next franchise lined up. Cavill has signed on to star in the upcoming live-action adaptation of Voltron from Amazon MGM Studios.According to The Hollywood Reporter, Cavill is only the second member of the Voltron cast to be announced. Daniel Quinn-Toye, a relative unknown, was also cast in a leading role after he won accolades for performing as Tom Holland's understudy in a Romeo \u0026 Juliet production in London's West End.No details about Cavill's role were disclosed, but if the film is staying close to the source material then he's likely playing Keith Kogane, the leader of a group of five space explorers who were sent by the Galaxy Alliance to the planet Arus. After their arrival, the team discovers the lost robot lions that let them combine and form Voltron in order to oppose King Zarkon and his Drule empire. Voltron is the only force in the universe that can stand up to Zarkon's monstrous robeasts and his plans to conquer Arus.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The cast and crew of What We Do In The Shadows are clearly exhausted. Not simply because they’re at the tail end of months of filming--a production schedule that was already delayed several months because of last year’s various strikes--but because it’s the final season, and the emotional weight of that thought is thick in the air as I sit down for back-to-back interviews with the creatives behind the show.Yana Gorskaya, an executive producer and director on the show, as well as the editor for the original film that led to the popular spin-off, feels as if she is on the verge of tears when asked how she feels about it all coming to an end. “I just have so much genuine affection for [the cast]. I dearly hope that I will work with them again, but in this grouping? All of them at the same time? That seems unlikely, and it is breaking my heart,” says Goskaya while holding back her emotions.However, despite all this, everyone working on the show assures the media attendees in the room that Shadows is still Shadows, and while this last run will feature some of the series’ biggest and zaniest moments, there was a deliberate intent to make it feel like any other season that, for the most part, you could jump into and casually watch without feeling that weight. “We really wanted to be careful not to make a final season that was only enjoyable to the 10% of fans who really watch everything,” says Paul Simms, a writer and executive producer. “We didn't want it to be like, ‘This old character comes back, and that's all tied up.’”Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has hinted at launching a Twitch channel focused on the strategy video game Civilization. During the Meta Connect 2024 conference, he spoke with Pubity, revealing his deep passion for the game: \"In terms of strategy games, the one that I'm more likely to want to be the best in the world at is Civilization.\" Zuckerberg didn't specify which version of Civilization he plays, leaving it unclear whether he means the original or a more recent entry in the series.Zuckerberg offered insight into his gaming routine, joking about his wife's reaction to his playtime logged. \"Priscilla looked at my Steam account the other day and she's like: 'What? You've played this for more than a thousand hours?'\" He went on to say, \"I think at some point, I should do like a Twitch stream of me playing with someone. Because I'm pretty convinced that I'm close to grandmaster status. I'd be surprised if anyone in the world could beat me at that.\" The Sid Meier's Civilization franchise, developed by Firaxis Games, has sold over 50 million copies globally, according to publisher 2K Games. Zuckerberg has previously mentioned his fondness for the game, even recalling during his 2017 Harvard commencement speech how he received his college acceptance letter while playing it.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Metaphor: ReFantazio features a job system referred to as Archetypes, which allows you to swap any of your party members to any Archetype pretty freely. While there are some requirements to use the advanced Archetypes, you will want to swap out Archetypes frequently. In some cases, like certain side dungeons, there are specific Archetypes that will be recommended based on the enemy weaknesses found there, but you can also ignore that if you like your setup. One of the most important factors for determining your team composition is the synthesis abilities that become available when you have specific Archetypes present in your party.Mage with Seeker, Healer, or MageThe Mage Archetype tree is incredibly powerful, especially early on, since it has access to fire, ice, and electric attacks, which allows you to target a variety of enemy weaknesses. However, the abilities the Mage and its advanced versions can use only targets a single enemy. If you want to use a version that can target all enemies at once, you will need to use the Synthesis version of these abilities, which only becomes available if you have another Mage, a Seeker, or a Healer present. Of those three options, the best to go with is the Healer since the Healer gets to use a light damage attack that targets all enemies if a Mage is present.Knight with back row damage dealersThe Knight is an excellent class that can fit into many team compositions since the Knight is a great tank. If you need to bring along multiple back-row damage dealers, like the Mage, Gunner, Healer, or Summoner, the Knight can get the attention of enemies to keep your squishy party members safe from danger. Even if the Knight's pierce damage isn't effective against the enemies you are fighting, focusing purely on defense can keep your party alive against tough enemies.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

As it stands, it's not confirmed that the missing voice-overs are directly related to the strike. Throughout the year, SAG-AFTRA approved AI voice acting for video games, while the union recently claimed that Formosa Interactive was guilty of committing \"a flagrant violation of labor law\" when the company allegedly tried to subvert the strike.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It's beloved for being a small and chaotic map, and it's returned several times over the years with different variations.The podcast includes an interview with Treyarch's associate creative director, Miles Leslie, who confirms Nuketown's return in Black Ops 6. The game's campaign takes place in the Gulf War, but when asked if Black Ops 6 would feature a '90s-themed variant of Nuketown, the developer was unable to confirm the map's setting.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The concept for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is already pretty buck wild, even for a spin-off. According to Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama, the result could have been even stranger: For a while, he wanted to make a fishing game called like a Dragon: Tuna.In an interview with the PlayStation Blog (via PCGamer), Yokoyama shared details about another potential idea for a spin-off. Brainstorming began around mid-2023, months prior to the release of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth on January 25, 2024. Before the team decided to have Goro Majima go on a pirate adventure, the plan was to feature Kazuma Kiryu as a tuna fisherman, who would set off to sea to fight against fishing boats. \"Long story short, it never came to fruition, but keywords like 'ship,' 'sea,' and 'fighting,' which had since then been engraved in my head, evolved into the concept of pirates,\" Yokoyama said. It was always the intention to create a spin-off starring characters who weren't Ichiban Kasuga, one of the protagonists of Infinite Wealth, but Majima ended up as the frontrunner.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

When I first laid eyes on Secret Door's Sunderfolk, while lurking to the rear of a gaggle of journomancers at a preview event last week, I let out an ostentatious sigh. Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal. To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven. Conceived during the pandemic lockdowns as a way to \"bring back game night\", but without the traditional 30-minute unboxing ritual, it's played on the big screen but controlled using a dedicated smartphone app, with players stroking and swiping to move characters and play cards.

This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven. Speaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have \"higher expectations\" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers. Read more",

    "description": "Coffee Stain Publishing have fully revealed Goat Simulator Remastered, a spruced-up take on 2014’s open world, ragdolling livestock sandbox with all of the original’s DLC included. I played a bit of this at Gamescom in August, and while the trailer below is proof positive that the remaster does indeed look newer and shinier, in the moment I couldn’t shake the idea from my memory banks that this was just how Goat Sim always looked.

This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been \"mythologised\" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply \"wouldn't fly today\".

    "description": "It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose. As such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.

    "description": "A few months ago, Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil walked out of the office of Revolution Software and onto the Shambles, the Diagon Alley-esque street that has survived since York’s days as a medieval trade hub. He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him. \"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword,\" said a young woman to her toddler. \"This is where Revolution are based.\" Cecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since. \"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write,\" Cecil says. \"We love our interaction with them.\" These might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him. Read more",

Still, you know what they say: when you’re holding a tiny screwdriver, everything starts to look like a tiny screw. So I understand if the call to replace the Deck’s internal SSD, or indeed that of your Asus ROG Ally, proves too strong. In which case, have a look at the Crucial P310, which I added to our best SSDs list just last week, and is currently joining in the Prime sale frivolities.

    "description": "The obvious way of bundling up Beautiful Light is probably \"Hunt Showdown meets S.T.A.L.K.E.R.\", and whoops, I've already committed to that in the headline. But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was The Town Of Light, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum. There's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from \"dreary forgotten school\" to \"gleaming underground base\". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction shooter where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies.

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last person who complimented you on your makeup? My coworker last week. I was wearing a little more coverage than usual, so I think the overall look was more polished than the bare bones FOTDs I’ve been wearing for months now. Amazing what a difference a little bit of concealer makes! 2. Last dream you can remember? Marnie and I were like the Scooby Doo detectives in our neighborhood, ha ha ha! We were working a case to unveil who had stolen all the tuna sandwiches in our circle. 3. Today the temperature in my neighborhood is/was ____. The Bay Area is experiencing a heat wave, ugh! It’s supposed to hit 94. I’m so over it. 4. Your cookie of choice?

    "description": "Rosie soaked up the last bits of summery weather today. She enjoyed basking underneath the trees, which still have leaves on them (but not for long). Among the many things she contemplated were cold fusion, a better way to produce nutritionally dense cat treats, how Marnie the dog is slowly ruining her life, and most importantly, what she’ll wear for Halloween. Unlike Tabs, who loved elaborate costumes, Rosie likes to keep it simple and chic. I asked if she needed any help brainstorming, but all I got were slow blinks and a tum flash in return. When it got too hot to be outside, Rosie made her way back indoors. I couldn’t help but notice her ignoring Marnie… I suspect Rosie’s afraid of Marnie rocking a costume that will steal Rosie’s thunder. Marnie, on the other hand, hasn’t even begun to think about Halloween. She started Marathoning Gilmore Girls this weekend, and she’s currently obsessed.

I can feel completely put together with just a bright lipstick, mascara and concealer. 2. Bright lipstick shouts however you’re feeling out loud to the world. A smile is that much bigger and brighter with a bright lip. 3. It’s a classic. Red lipstick never goes out of style! 4. The long-wearing matte formulas have improved so much. They last through water, coffee, cat kisses… 5. They’re just so fun to collect!

I forgot how beautiful it looks in pictures! The Honest Beauty eyeshadow palette comes with a card with four looks you can do with the palette. I followed the one called “Classic Smoky Eye” for this post, although with one tweak. I started by buffing the matte beige shade (Vanilla’d Velvet) all over my lids as a base so the subsequent colors would pop a little more. I was a wee bit nervous about using the shimmery gold all over my lids and the shimmery dark purple on the outer corner because…I’m in my 40s now, and shine doesn’t always play well with my 40-something skin, particularly in the crease. Some may even say that I’m “overly picky about shimmery finishes,” *ahem*. Can you blame me though? One false move and you see every fine line!

If you could move anywhere in the world without having to put any effort into it at all (assume someone takes care of the packing, logistics, paperwork, finances, etc.), where would you go? I’d move us to the Manoa neighborhood on Oahu in a heartbeat. 3. What’s a weird breakfast that you like to eat?
