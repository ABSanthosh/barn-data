    "description": "Every now and then we publish a round-up of game or demo recommendations, and all you regular readers dutifully fill the comments with recommendations of your own. FOOLS. Our round-ups are, of course, a devious trap for your curiosity and connoisseurship, designed to save us the labour of discovering good games for ourselves. You know in Batman Forever when Jim Carrey uses Riddler TV to steal everybody's IQs? Well picture me doing that, except that I am not wearing tight green pyjamas (unless you want to picture me that way - no offence taken) and I am actually filling my skull with everything you ever knew about, in Moadra's case, manky Super Metroid clones.

    "description": "Monolith Productions co-founder Jace Hall has expressed a strong interest in remaking rancid horror game Condemned: Criminal Origins and its sequel, Condemned 2: Bloodshot. It's not entirely clear how he'd do this, given that Monolith no longer exists even as a brand name, following cuts at parent company Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment, and that Hall himself doesn't seem to be directly involved with game development or publishing these days. That said, he is the sole current owner of the Condemned intellectual property. So if a remake is going to happen, it'll need to happen through him. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which would you rather collect: vintage clothes or vintage furniture? I could do both, but if I could only pick one, I’d have to go with vintage clothes, mostly because I don’t have a big enough house to collect furniture pieces. Sigh! Oh, and also, I don’t want to worry about my furniture being beat up by the pets and the kids playing in my house, you know? 2. How good are you with keeping secrets? If you tell me something in confidence, it’s going to the grave with me, babe; however, I do have an exception policy. If I believe someone’s in danger, then I’m gonna say something. 3. Who’s the coolest Jennifer: Jennifer Hudson, Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Garner or Jennifer Coolidge? Jennifer Coolidge, all the[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 869 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "That little girl in the picture above turned nine years old today. Yup, today is Connor Claire’s ninth birthday! Wow. I remember that day up there like it was yesterday. Poor Tabs… He was slightly confused about the overall gist of the festivities. I think he thought it was a get-together to celebrate him. We didn’t want to burst his bubble, so we took a brief interlude to sing him the birthday song. “Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear tabby… Happy birthday to you!” 🙂 Connor Claire didn’t mind, and there was more than enough food, fun and love for everyone. It was kind of weird, but for the most part, Tabs wasn’t as social as he usually is. He spent most of the afternoon napping at the top of the stairs, away from the party. I checked in on him from time to time and gave him chin scratches and whispered that I love him. Maybe he thought that his toddler assistant deserved to be the center of attention[Continue reading...] The post Select Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 853 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
