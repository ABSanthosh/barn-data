    "description": "The real test of Shadow Labyrinth lies in getting through the Great Tree, also known as the Sky-High Tree. This is one of the first objectives that involves a substantial amount of traversal. If you're used to playing Metroidvanias, you might know what to expect. There are plenty of paths that lead to secondary rooms, and even optional areas. While they're useful to gather resources, it can be easy to get lost. Moreover, the game's map can be quite obtuse, and you might miss doors and ledges that pertain to the main objective.If you're finding it difficult to get through the Sky-high Tree areas, don't fret. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough detailing how to get through the Great Tree in Shadow Labyrinth, which culminates in a boss fight that rewards you with a key ability to continue moving forward.How to get through the Great Tree in Shadow LabyrinthYou'll get access to the Great Tree area after defeating Orange G-HOST: Garbage Talos and obtaining the GAIA form thanks to the G-Phase Shift. Confusing nouns aside, the starting segments of the area are fairly linear. The key here is learning enemy patterns, as you'll encounter quite a few new foes while heading east.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Shadow Labyrinth can be tough, and your HP Tank is an invaluable tool. On paper, it's similar to the Flask of Crimson Tears in Elden Ring, with the big difference being that using it restores the entirety of your health bar. It's great--the problem, however, is that for a long while, you only have access to one HP Tank.As you traverse through the second main area of the game, which tasks you with reaching the top of the Sky-high Tree, you can come across an additional HP Tank. This, however, can be easily missed if you're rushing through things. If you're wondering how to get a second HP tank in Shadow Labyrinth, make sure to read the steps below promptly so you don't have to waste time backtracking later on.How to get a second HP Tank in Shadow LabyrinthThe location of the second HP tank in Shadow Labyrinth is in the forest area as you're making your way through the Great Tree (also referred to as Sky-High Tree). We have a dedicated guide with a Great Tree walkthrough in case you need some guidance, as it's easy to get lost.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Conveniently, you can currently get Civilization 6 for free on the Epic Games Store - the giveaway runs till 24th July. Of course, if you're mad about Civ 7's failings, there's a fair chance you already own Civ 6. But the freebie does include access to all of the game's DLC and expansions, so might be worth bagging if you only ever bought the base game from a different store. For clarity, you do not need to stick two fingers up at Civ 7 while downloading the free version of Civ 6. It is a piece of software and cannot respond to your hatred. Read more",

    "description": "Rosie should have known better than to trust Marnie with Rosie’s investments. After all, Marnie doesn’t have any background or credentials or expertise in financial planning. There was no reason to think Marnie would be able to manage Rosie’s assets, but Rosie wanted to give her a chance. Oh, well. Bad move on Rosie’s part. Even someone of Rosie’s intellectual stature screws up sometimes. Sure, she may understand quantum physics better than any other cat on the planet, but that doesn’t mean she understands compound interest. Sigh… Now Rosie has to think of a way of to recoup all those losses. Hmm… What could she invent?

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you keep backups of your favorite products? These days, the only backups I buy are things I know I’ll finish on a regular basis (like shampoo and conditioner, or body lotion). I don’t even bother with makeup backups anymore, though.
