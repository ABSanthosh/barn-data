    "description": "Nearly a year ago, Rockstar Games debuted the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6, which marks the franchise's first sequel since Grand Theft Auto 5 in 2013. Fans had been hoping that today's fiscal report for Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, would include a new GTA 6 trailer. While that didn't happen, Take-Two did confirm that the GTA sequel is still on track for a fall 2025 release.While speaking with CNBC, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick acknowledged that some of the company's previous games have slipped from their originally announced release dates. However, he expressed his confidence that GTA 6 would make its release window. Zelnick also stressed that the extended development of the game is more centered on enhancing the experience rather than ironing out bugs.\"In the case of an extraordinary title, for which there are extraordinary expectations, it's not really about bugs, it's about creating an experience that no one's seen before, and Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do,\" explained Zelnick. \"And perfection is indeed hard to measure, it really is more subjective than objective.\"Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Previously priced at $76 at Amazon, The Mandalorian Season 3 was the last of the four upcoming Disney Originals on 4K Blu-ray to receive a price cut. Collector's Edition Steelbooks for Ahsoka Season 1, Hawkeye Season 1, and Loki Season 2 dropped to $52.46 at Amazon and Walmart earlier this week. All four of the upcoming Star Wars and Marvel Collector's Editions release December 3.Just like the first two waves of Disney+ physical releases, they will only be available in this collectible steelbook format and are bundled with three art cards. But there is one notable difference with these 4K releases: audio. These will be the first of Disney's Marvel and Star Wars series to support 4K Ultra HD Dolby Vision and Atmos Audio. Additionally, Disney isn't releasing 1080p Blu-ray editions this time; all previous releases in this series included 4K and standard Blu-ray versions.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last show you binged watched? “The Diplomat” season 2 on Netflix with Keri Russell. It’s a little silly but I like how they weave real things that happen in the world into it. 2. Have you started planning for Thanksgiving yet? Girl, no. LOL! I barely made it through the Halloween season, which honestly felt like it was three years long. I know in a few years, when Connor’s older, I’ll miss all the activities. Anyway, for Thanksgiving, we’re invited to a dinner that a friend is hosting, so we’ll probably do that. Or, we’ll just stay at home in our jammies, watch movies and have a crab fest again. So fun! 3. Pick your fall nail color – red, burgundy or dark blue? Ooh, burgundy please![Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 855 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Last year Harris, that dastardly lothario, won the annual Novato pumpkin growing contest, which came as a huge shock to Rosie because she thinks he’s mentally inferior. While that may be true, Harris has figured out how to grow big pumpkins. This year, Rosie isn’t holding back. She’s put a lot of time and scientific work into maximizing her pumpkin yields. She also read a bunch of books on botany and interviewed all the top minds in the field. Hopefully she can reclaim the crown that Tabs once had. 😸 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 836 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
