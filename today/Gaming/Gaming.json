Greek yogurt, vanilla protein powder, raspberries (for fiber!) are my favorites. I also like bananas or apples for sweetness. 3. Something about your current makeup routine that bugs you?

Not only is it pretty cheap, but Small Soldiers comes with a limited-edition steelbook case.Sure, when it comes to '90s movies starring talking toys, those who grew up during that era probably think of Toy Story first, but Small Soldiers is genuinely great. Just like Toy Story, it deserves to be watched by kids growing up today, too.
