    "description": "Dragon Age Origins is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, November 3, 2024. Below, we examine its role as a daring, if awkward, attempt to use sex as a central theme and mechanic.Sex and video games have always had an uneasy relationship. Playing smut on the Atari 2600 feels like looking at middle-school scrawlings. Much of the pornography peddled on Steam is embarrassing and unattractive. Even more mainstream games in the modern era have had a fraught relationship with sex. The tame scenes in Mass Effect infamously got a paranoid Fox News report. Recent years have seen recording romantic scenes in Baldur's Gate 3 net players temporary Xbox bans. In such an environment, it is hard to imagine a mainstream game having a bold depiction of sex. But 20 years ago, Dragon Age: Origins took a daring, if flawed, swing at it.Dragon Age: Origins is still a weird mix. The basic plot is downright Tolkien-esque: a fellowship of warriors from across the land are driven together to stop \"the blight,\" a horde of demon creatures dedicated to destroying all free life. In practice, however, the game takes most of its dramatic cues from A Song of Ice and Fire (the books, not Game of Thrones). Nobleman Loghan leaves boy king Cailan to die, triggering a violent succession crisis. Magic, while more commonplace than in Westeros, is marginalized, feared, and policed. Even the blight itself resembles the white walkers, i.e. a fundamental existential threat from the natural world.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "10 Fortnite hidden gnomes are scattered across the Remix Chapter 2 island--just like the old days. Remember when Fortnite used to hide gnomes all over the island? Well, in Fortnite Remix Chapter 2, the game is at it again. It makes perfect sense, too, as the game has returned to the Chapter 2 island--with a remix, of course. In this guide we'll show you where to find all 10 Fortnite gnome locations.Unlike most modern Fortnite quests, these gnome locations won't be shown on the quest screen, even if you track the quest. It's like an extra layer of nostalgia for a time when Fortnite demanded you look outside the game to solve some of its mysteries.You can use our pictures below to spot the gnomes precisely where they are--don't worry, they never move so you'll always find them in these spots until you interact with them to collect each gnome.If you prefer a map showing all the locations from a bird's eye view, scroll to the bottom. Before you head off, though, here are a few tips:Make sure you interact with each gnome to check it off your list. Just spotting it or even hitting it with a car or your pickaxe isn't enough.Secondly, you can grab gnomes in any order. Though our map numbers it the 10th and final gnome, you may be best off trying to grab the gnome atop the southeast snowy mountain--The Weather Station, as the landmark is known--because there's a helicopter there and you can use it to quickly travel between locations.Lastly, you don't need to get every gnome in one round. In fact, you will likely not due to the storm damage (not to mention other players). 1. Craggy Cliffs - Behind the cash register of a store on the west side 2. On the beach northwest of Steamy Stacks 3. Beneath a electrical tower south of Steamy Stacks 4. By a campfire along the riverfront southeast of Frenzy Farms 5. Next to the waterfall and on a rock ledge beneath the wooden bridge 6. On the small wooden bridge in the middle of Weeping Woods 7. Behind a tree just east of Holly Hedges 8. Inside a living room of a home in the southeast corner of Holly Hedges 9. Inside a small shack just southwest of Misty Meadows 10. Near a solar panel atop the snowy mountain east of Misty Meadows All 10 Fortnite gnome locations",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last Halloween costume you wore? Hmm, a couple years ago I was a panda! It was a low-effort panda though. LOL! 2. Best and worst Halloween candy? I used to love Snickers, but now I find them too sweet, so please give me all the Ghrirardelli Caramel Squares. As for the worst ones, I automatically toss the rolls of Smarties and anything licorice related. Blech! 3. Pick your Halloween nail color – orange or black? Black with a high shine top coat please. 4. Vampires or werewolves? I’d rather hang out with the werewolves. 5. Scariest Halloween movie? “The Shining” still freaks me out! Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon.[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 854 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "No one threw a Halloween shindig like Tabs — fancy cat costumes, spooky snacks, special appearances from top-tier talent, including Tabs. In fact, Heidi Klum stole the idea for her spooky soirees from him. Here’s a look back at a typical Halloween 🎃 and all the prep Tabs usually did. My Darlings, There’s an old saying in the plus-size kitty modeling world: “Go big or go home,” and I take that phrase to heart when it comes to hosting parties. I want my guests to be talking about them for years to come. Being a famous feline supermodel, I’ve hosted many Halloween shindigs in my time, and I have almost a decade of party-planning experience. In that vein, here are the four essential components of a successful feline Halloween party. 1. Invitations First things first — the invitations. In the digital age, e-vites and group invites via Facebook are acceptable; however, I’m a little old fashioned. I prefer paper invitations. Do what I do, and ask your assistant to design you a custom invite.
