    "description": "I've long appreciated State of Decay as the exciting middle ground between an approachable zombie game like Days Gone or Dead Rising, and unforgiving survival sims like DayZ and Project Zomboid. No series or game that I know of has found that same middle ground--harsh, but digestible. But maybe that's no longer true. While I impatiently await more news for State of Decay 3 from Undead Labs and Xbox, Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days is giving me a similar experience with some welcome twists on the formula.Into The Dead might be a name-brand undead devotees already know. Previous to now, it's been the name of a first-person auto-runner series on mobile. They're neat games, but they really aren't trying to do too much other than being a gritty, scary, first-person take on something like a Jetpack Joyride--a fun, albeit one-note, time-filler for bus rides or lunch breaks. Our Darkest Days is far from that and more in line with what a console or PC player might expect of a zombie game.Presented in a 2.5D art style, Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days is essentially a side-scrolling State of Decay, and if that series isn't already unforgiving enough, it seems like Our Darkest Days also looked to This War of Mine for inspiration. I recently checked out a demo for the upcoming game on PC--a demo you can now play yourself, by the way--and the best thing I can say about it is that I was so impressed that I actually stopped playing at a point when I could've gone further, because I want to preserve as much of the experience as I can for when the game is out and my save data will carry over. But I saw enough to know this game is worth that deeper look.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Earlier this week, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 had an update that teased the return of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. In a skate park map called The Grind, there is a banner with the THPS logo and the date \"03.04.25.\" Now, the official site for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater has a countdown clock to March 4, 2025, which may mean an announcement is imminent.The very first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game was released by Activision in September 1999. Although the 25th anniversary has come and gone, Hawk revealed last year that he has been in contact with Activision about doing something to celebrate that quarter century milestone. Hawk later confirmed that the long-running franchise will continue.If there's news coming soon regarding the future of THPS, there are two likely options. The first is another remake like 2020's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, which helped revitalize interest in the games. There have been some predictions that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 could follow. However, a more enticing prospect would be a brand-new Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The last fully original game in the series to hit consoles was 2015's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5. Additionally, there was a previous report that the next Tony Hawk game could arrive as soon as this summer. Given the timing of the announcement, that seems very plausible.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

You're playing as robot cat Claws, and Gollop is plucky spacefarer Chip. He's zipping around the map hoovering up resources on a hoverbike he's nabbed from a building that gifts you both special tech. You've got a rocket pack that lets you double jump, accessing new structure blueprints hidden in high places.

Between me not feeling like my usual self and struggling with some health things, we haven’t been spending a lot of time together, not like we used to. I want you to know, though, that I am still here, and that I still love you very much. I will always be so very proud of you and everything we’ve accomplished together. What’s in store for us this next year? I don’t know, but I have a feeling that it’s going to be a year full of love, growth and adventure.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Muumuu or tutu? Muumuu, babe. Mrs. Roper style all the way! 2. French braid or a messy bun? Messy bun. It’s like the default state of my hair these days, hahaha. 3. Something that reminds you of home? The smell of wet eucalyptus leaves (it’s a very Nor Cal scent, IMHO). Seeing green rolling hills in the distance. Bridges. 4. What’s the last book you finished that you’d like to recommend to a friend (aka me, hahaha)? I just finished reading “One Italian Summer” by Rebecca Searle, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It’s sweet and thoughtful, and I felt like I was on an Italian vacation in Positano while I was reading it. 5. Your feelings about nail art?
