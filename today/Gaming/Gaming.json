The retailer no longer discloses whether you are getting a North American release or an imported game. All Nintendo Switch games are region-free, and every game in the list above is playable in English. That said, this is important to consider for games with DLC, such as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Pokemon Scarlet \u0026 Violet. If you do not get a North American version and want the DLC, you will need to purchase that content from the eShop matching your game. So if you get a UK game, you need to download DLC from the UK eShop, which requires making a separate Nintendo account. Not many games in the list above--or Nintendo games in general--have DLC, but this is worth keeping in mind.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "There's a very curious sight in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, one that you'll stumble upon once you reach the Himalayas level. It also happens to have a tricky puzzle where the solution isn't as obvious at first glance. Here's our guide on how to complete the Code Table and Captain's Code in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.How to solve the Code Table and Captain's Code in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - Puzzle guideThe Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Captain's Code puzzle is part of the main quest in the Himalayas. It's called A Harsh Climb. As you explore the ship, you'll eventually arrive at an officer's mess hall where everyone has frozen to death. You need to check out a few clues if you want to open the metal door. The Captain's Code clueThe first clue comes from the Captain's Code document. It has the following letters written on it: J-Ö-G-M.There are also two more Code Table documents in this room, but we'll discuss these in a while. Code CipherIf you check the room, you'll see several Code Tables--i.e. disks with letters--on the counter and on the floor. Pick these up and place them in the cipher in the correct order:First slot: The disk with the letter \"J\"Second slot: The disk with the letter \"Ö\" (umlaut)Third slot: The disk with the letter \"G\"Fourth slot: The disk with the letter \"M\" Code Table and Captain's Code solutionOnce all disks are inside the cipher, dial in the letters until \"J-Ö-G-M\" are selected. Curiously enough, nothing happens. However, if you look at the letters below the \"solution,\" you'll see that they spell out \"B-L-U-T.\"Read the Code Table document again. You'll notice \"B-L-U-T\" has a corresponding numerical sequence: 3666. Interact with the panel on the door and input 3-6-6-6. This is the passcode for \"B-L-U-T\" and it will cause the door to get unlocked.That does it for our guide on how to complete the Code Table and Captain's Code puzzle in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. A bit later in the campaign, you have to deal with yet another brain teaser. You can learn more about it in our A Gate of Wits/Mak-Yek guide.You're bound to encounter many secrets, puzzles, and challenges in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. As you continue your adventure, we encourage you to take a look at our Indiana Jones and the Great Circle guides hub.",

    "description": "I’m hesitant to say that I’ve got my makeup mojo back because I feel like the moment that I say that I’ll revert to just wearing brow pencil and tinted sunscreen for three years, as one does, but I’m gonna go ahead and risk it and say that it all started with a little bit of Club. You know, MAC Club eyeshadow? Of course you do. It’s a classic. Last week, out of nowhere, I thought to myself, “I really need to wear Club.” It’s been years since I’ve wanted to deal with complicated eye makeup, but I got the urge, so I went with it. My makeup collection is pretty barren compared to the thick of MBB’s beauty blogging days, but I’ve held on to this ancient Monster’s Bride palette from —I don’t even wanna say the year. LOL! I’ve always loved the shadows, especially Club. I took a little bit of Club, popped it on my lids and smoothed out the edges with a fluffy brush dipped in face powder.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. A habit that changed your life? Getting up early. For most of my life I was a night owl, and when I had Connor that all changed. When she was an infant, I started waking up at the crack of dawn to sneak in work before she woke up in the morning. The habit ended up sticking, and now I’m an early bird. 2. Fruit or cupcakes? As much as I love a small cake smothered in frosting, I’m gonna have to go with fruit. 3. Are you doing any advent calendars this year? At Trader Joe’s a couple weeks ago, I picked up a few for the “kids” – Connor, Rosie and Marnie. Ha ha ha! 4. Something on your Christmas list?
