    "description": "Superman Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray) $38 Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart Superman Standard Editions $30 for 4K | $25 for Blu-ray | $21 for DVD Preorder 4K Preorder Blu-ray Preorder DVD The new James Gunn-directed Superman movie only just started its theatrical run this week, but preorders are already live for its upcoming Blu-ray release, including a 4K Steelbook Edition that's available for $38. There's also a standard 4K and regular Blu-ray version available available to preorder as well. While there's no release date yet, Blu-rays tend to launch about three months after a film's theatrical run, so we expect these to launch in Fall. That said, preordering the Superman 4K Steelbook or standard edition Blu-rays now means you won't be charged until your order ships, and if the price changes between now and then, you'll only pay the lowest amount. Superman Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray) $38 A release date hasn't been confirmed yet, but we expect this will be out three months after the theatrical run, with October looking likely for the launch of this Blu-ray. The steelbook cover is an an attention-grabber, as it features the entrance to Superman's Fortress of Solitude secret base on the cover, and on the inside, you'll spot the Man of Steel walking through this crystalline ode to his lost homeworld. Bonus materials haven't been revealed yet for this release, but films based on DC Comics generally have a solid assortment of behind-the-scenes featurettes that do a great job at exploring their respective movies. The 2022 release of The Batman is a prime example of this approach--as it is loaded with all manner of content that examines everything from how that incarnation of the Caped Crusader was developed to the creation of his Batmobile and gadgets. Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart Superman Standard Editions $30 for 4K | $25 for Blu-ray | $21 for DVD While the 4K Steelbook Edition is the standout version, you can also preorder a standard edition of the movie on 4K UHD, Blu-ray, or DVD. The finalized cover art for these versions has not been revealed, and like the Steelbook Edition, we don't yet know what bonus features will be included. Nevertheless, preorders are available now at Amazon. Preorder 4K Preorder Blu-ray Preorder DVD Superman 4K Steelbook Edition Blu-ray Superman: The Art and Making of the Film $50 | Releases November 18 A Blu-ray for Superman isn't the only piece of tie-in content on the way, as you can read up on the movie with the upcoming Superman: The Art and Making of the Film art book launching November 18. This 176-page hardcover book features concept art, costume and character designs, and illustrations for the multiple locations featured in the movie, along with interviews with director James Gunn and other key members of the creative team, as well as a foreword written by Superman actor David Corenswet.Preorders are available now for $50 Preorder at Amazon Superman Prime Day DealsAt the time of writing, several Superman Blu-rays and graphic novels are still on special for Prime Day. There's a good chance that these might no longer be available at the prices listed below by the time you read this, but if you are looking to plug any gaps in your Superman collection, there's no shortage of options here.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you keep backups of your favorite products? These days, the only backups I buy are things I know I’ll finish on a regular basis (like shampoo and conditioner, or body lotion). I don’t even bother with makeup backups anymore, though. If I finish something like a blush or an eyebrow pencil, great, and if it’s still around when it’s time to restock, that’s even better. If it’s discontinued, I might mourn it a little bit, but there’s always something new coming out, and I don’t mind trying new things, so I don’t stress about it too much. 2. Something that you read/watched/listened to recently that was surprisingly great?

I also love that you can put them in salads, roast them or just eat them plain with a variety of different dips. 2. A song that’s been stuck in your head lately? “Top of the World” by The Carpenters has been on repeat in my car. 3. Something you’ve been avoiding lately?

That's far from all of the studio's plans, with wider shakeups also in the pipeline. This outlining of plans to make sure the good ship SOT is not only seaworthy, but can successfully broadside the many other vessels competing for its players' attention comes with some depressing and un-piratey context. It follows Rare being one of the studios affected by Microsoft's mass layoffs earlier this month, with Everwild being among the number of in-development games cancelled as part of the cuts.
