    "description": "Marvel's Spider-Man 2 $40 (was $70) See at Amazon See at Best Buy See at Target Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition $40 (was $70) See at Amazon See at Best Buy See at Best Buy (Standard) PlayStation's lineup of Black Friday and holiday deals is loaded with discounts on PS5 consoles and VR headsets, DualSense Controllers, and, of course, plenty of console-exclusive games. Most of the PS5 game deals match all-time low prices, but there are a few that have never been this cheap. One of those is Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which is on sale for only $40, a full $30 off its usual $70 price.Marvel's Spider-Man 2 -- $40 ($70)Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition -- $40 ($70)Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales -- $20 ($50) Marvel's Spider-Man 2 $40 (was $70) Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was one of the biggest games of 2023, and it often still sells for its full $70 price. Insomniac Games built on the formula from Marvel's Spider-Man and Miles Morales, delivering the biggest and most dynamic open-world adventure starring Spider-Man yet. Well, Spider-Men, as the sequel features both Peter Parker and Miles Morales as playable characters. It's a blast to swing around New York City as either Spider-Man, and each character's unique combat abilities make switching back and forth between them a consistently satisfying experience.You can get Marvel's Spider-Man 2 for $40 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. See at Amazon See at Best Buy See at Target Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition $40 (was $70) If the PS5 Slim Black Friday deal has caused you to join the PlayStation ecosystem, you'll also want to check out Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, which is on sale for only $20 at Best Buy (Amazon is sold out). Miles Morales bridges the gap between the two numbered entries in the series. It's a smaller-scale experience that feels more like a meaty expansion than a brand-new game.New players will want to opt for the Ultimate Edition, a value pack that includes Miles Morales and Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, a great enhanced version of the 2018 PS4 exclusive. Though PlayStation sells the remaster separately on PSN, it honestly doesn't make sense to buy it this way, not when there's a deal that drops the Ultimate Edition to $40. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered actually costs $10 more than this two-game bundle.Whether you buy Miles Morales on its own or in the Ultimate Edition, these prices match their all-time lows.Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is a superb sequel and can be played without knowledge of its predecessors, but you'll miss out on some references to the other games, and the story likely won't feel as impactful. Plus, both of Insomniac's previous Spider-Man games are awesome, too. See at Amazon See at Best Buy See at Best Buy (Standard) DualSense Controllers Save $20 on all styles See at Amazon See at Walmart See at Best Buy More PS5 Game Deals at Amazon \u0026 Best BuyMultiple other PS5 console exclusives are on sale for new low prices, including Astro Bot, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, and Rise of the Ronin.Astro Bot -- $50 ($60)Days Gone -- $20 ($40)Death Stranding Director's Cut -- $20 ($50)Demon's Souls -- $30 ($70)Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth (Exclusive Amazon Edition) -- $40 ($70)God of War: Ragnarok (PS5) -- $30 ($70)Gran Turismo 7 (PS5) -- $30 ($70)Helldivers 2 -- $30 ($40)Horizon Forbidden West -- $30 ($50)Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition -- $40 ($60)Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales -- $20 ($50)Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition -- $40 ($70)Marvel's Spider-Man 2 -- $40 ($70)Ratchet \u0026 Clank: Rift Apart -- $30 ($70)Returnal -- $30 ($70)Rise of the Ronin -- $40 ($70)Sackboy: A Big Adventure -- $20 ($60)Stellar Blade -- $50 ($70)The Last of Us Part 1 -- $30 ($70)The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered -- $40 ($50)Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection -- $20 ($50) See PS5 Game Deals at Best Buy See all PlayStation Deals at Amazon PlayStation VR 2: Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle $350 (was $600) See at Amazon See at Target See at PS Direct PlayStation VR 2 $350 (was $550) See at Amazon See at Target See at Walmart",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Butter on your toast – yes or no? Yes please! And if it’s Kerrygold Salted Butter, then woo hoo. 2. Your two favorite seasons? Fall and spring. 3. Pick your red lipstick for the day – what’s the name? Rouge Dior 999. 4. A Thanksgiving dish you don’t like? Soggy gray green bean casserole. 5. A color that makes you happy? Yellow (hence the picture of the butter at the top, ha). Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon. 1. Butter on your toast – yes or no? 2.

    "description": "Don’t let the torbitude and dreamy eyes fool ya. Rosie is a ruthless competitor. She knows what she wants, and she usually gets it. Take, for instance, last summer’s crisis over her favorite treats, the aptly named Temptations, in tasty chicken flavor. She wanted more of them than I could provide. To be honest, she wanted them all — all of the Tasty Chicken Temptations nationwide. She threw herself into research, trying to reverse engineer the recipe for Temptations; however, every batch was a little bit off. Growing frustrated, she encountered an old sailor cat in a downtown Novato bar who told her the story of El Río de Tentación, the River of Temptation… According to the legend, hidden somewhere along the banks of the Sacramento River in Northern California were ancient ruins, within which held the Lost Book of Temptation, the book that contained the original recipe for Tasty Chicken Temptations.
