    "description": "Tomtoc Hardshell Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2 $33.30 (was $37) with coupon See at Amazon Tomtoc Crossbody Sling Bag for Nintendo Switch 2 $45 (was $50) with promo code See at Amazon Tomtoc Shoulder Bag for Nintendo Switch 2 \u0026 Steam Deck $50 (was $53) See at Amazon Carrying case and travel bag manufacturer Tomtoc has been a popular choice for Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck users for years. Now, like many other third-party companies, Tomtoc has launched its first options for Nintendo Switch 2. The manufacturer is known for its sleek, hardshell cases as well as its range of stylish shoulder bags, and the pair of Switch 2 Tomtoc products showcase exactly that. Tomtoc's Carrying Case and Crossbody Sling Bag are available to ship now from Amazon.Tomtoc's hardshell case has quickly vaulted to the top of Amazon's list of the best-selling Nintendo Switch cases, and is pretty high up on the bestsellers list for gaming in general (as of May 6). With preorders for Nintendo's official Switch 2 carrying cases currently sold out, Tomtoc's cases will likely continue to be popular as we inch closer to the Switch 2's June 5 launch. Tomtoc Hardshell Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2 $33.30 (was $37) with coupon The Switch 2 version of Tomtoc's signature design, this hardshell case offers a form-fitting, sleek design. Tomtoc used water-resistant felt materials to provide a soft feel on both the outside and inside of the case. While you'll still want to carry your Switch 2 around carefully, if Tomtoc's Switch and Steam Deck cases are any indication, this Switch 2 case should provide ample protection. The precision fit, shock-absorbing cushions, and materials, which Tomtoc claims are lighter and sturdier than EVA, should keep your console snug and safe, whether it's bouncing around inside your backpack or (hopefully not) tumbling toward cement.Other useful features include a sturdy buckle, an adjustable wrist-strap that can also double as a handle, and space to store up to 12 game cards.Normally $37, you can save 10% on the price by clicking the coupon box below the price. There are three color options: black, gray, and white. See at Amazon Tomtoc Crossbody Sling Bag for Nintendo Switch 2 $45 (was $50) with promo code Tomtoc's other option gives you enough space to carry your Switch 2 and several accessories. This crossbody bag is also constructed from lightweight materials, and inside you'll find a dedicated compartment for your Switch 2. This section is crafted with an EVA hard shell to help shield against collisions, and there's a soft lining to help protect the Switch screen from any scratches.You'll also find enough space here for a Switch 2 Pro Controller, up to eight game cards, a charger, and space for smaller accessories like additional cables and earphones.You can also get a 10% discount on this bag by clicking the coupon on the page listing. Three color options are available: black, two-tone gray, and a red and white edition. See at Amazon Tomtoc Shoulder Bag for Nintendo Switch 2 \u0026 Steam Deck $50 (was $53) If you have multiple large gaming handhelds, Tomtoc also offers a bag that is shaped to hold a Switch 2 or one of several mobile PC gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck or ROG Ally X. This plush shoulder bag has a removable EVA insert designed to protect your handheld from drops as well as plenty of space for accessories. Unlike the two options above, this Tomtoc bag isn't a brand-new release, but it's worth mentioning here because of its versatility and standing as one of Tomtoc's most popular travel bags. See at Amazon The three cases above are just the tip of the Switch 2 iceberg when it comes to third-party accessories for Nintendo Switch 2 at Amazon. Some of the highlights here include hardshell carrying cases designed to offer a more durable option at an attractive price, like Spigen's Rugged Armor Protective Case/Grip for $30 at Amazon. JSAUX, another popular manufacturer of Steam Deck and Switch accessories, also just released a range of Switch 2 accessories for budget-friendly prices.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Pick how much ice you’d like in your drink: all the way to the brim, half full, a few cubes or no ice at all? Half full, please. That’s purr-fect! 2. Have you ever raised a puppy or a kitten? Yes. It’s a wonderful experience, but be prepared to have your nice things destroyed! Oh, and you can forget about your couch ever looking pristine again. 3. How often do you hit the snooze button in the morning? Just once. I used to just get up when the alarm went right off, but lately, eh, I’ve been loving a little extra sleep. 4. What decade has the best clothes? I’m probably biased because I wish I could go back to 1998 at least once a day, but[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 877 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

What sports would you have liked to have played as a kid? I would’ve loved to have taken dance classes. I think I would’ve enjoyed soccer, too. 2. Would you rather listen to the radio or replay a favorite album? Replay a favorite album. Speaking of that, my family will probably freak out if I play the greatest hits from Fleetwood Mac one more time. 3. Have you ever had a job where you had to be on your feet all day? Yup. I’ve done retail and worked in the back of the house in a bakery. Gotta have supportive shoes! 4. Do you have any travel plans for the summer? Right now we’ve got one camping trip to the Russian River planned, and that’s it.
