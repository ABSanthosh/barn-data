    "description": "Hello, my friend. Merry Christmas to you! I hope that today you’re feeling loved, calm and joyful. We got back from Hawaii a couple days ago, and it’s been a whirlwind of cookie baking, card writing and gift delivering so far. I still feel the aloha sprit in my heart, though, and it’s keeping me warm and cozy in this chilly Bay Area day. How have your holidays been so far? I feel like mine flew by in the blink of an eye. Although I wanted to do so much more for everyone in my life, I’ve realized that at a certain point one just needs to accept that there’s only so many hours in the day and so much energy to go around, and you can only do the best you can. It’s truly been a season of grace on this end of the keyboard. Grace for myself, and grace for others. Anywho, since I spent most of last week with my toes in the sand, here are some pictures that I’ve been meaning[Continue reading...] The post Merry Christmas appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

Have I ever told you that one of my least favorite things on Earth — ON EARTH — is parking lots at Christmas? Not. A. Fan. Man, the Costco parking lot by my house? Or, rather, any Costco parking lot in any town in America at Christmas? How can it take 20 minutes for my car to move 20 feet? Ladybugs on the ground are passing my car. A snail that hitched a ride on my car overnight literally climbed back down to the road because it knew it could go faster. 😂 But I digress… Tabs loved Christmases, but it was easy for him because he was the boss, whereas I’m the one who had to do all the jobs. I had to decorate the office, make all the ornaments, get all the gifts, schedule all the cat spa services. It was a lot! Thankfully, Rosie is more chill about Christmas.

    "description": "My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. So! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin. Read more",

The Epic Games Store continues to give away a free game each week, and this week is another nice find with a price that can't be beaten.
