    "description": "There are many reasons why you might need an infinite water source in Minecraft. Maybe you just want the convenience of having water nearby if you've built a base far away from the water. Perhaps you're in a Minecraft server with challenges such as Skyblock, and need to have additional water with limited space. Whatever your need for infinite water, we've got you covered, and even have a solution for infinite water using just one water block.Minecraft water can be found everywhere, but you might not always have it close byHow to get infinite waterThe first guaranteed way to get infinite water in Minecraft is to place two source blocks of water in a 2x2 grid at diagonal corners. This way, you only need four blocks total, as the other two diagonals will convert to source blocks. To add the water, simply craft two buckets and collect it from a nearby river, ocean, or lake.The next, slightly more complicated way, but that only requires one source block, is to dig a T-shaped hole and put one block elevated higher than ground level at the top of the T, resulting in a cross shape. Then, add a water source to the side of the elevated block so that it flows down and fills the dug-out shape.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Soâ€¦what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isnâ€™t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. Itâ€™s just a list of more or less random questions Iâ€™ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What made you smile today? Itâ€™s early in the day (I just woke up 30 minutes ago), but so far petting Marnie and Rosie, and re-reading the homemade Motherâ€™s Day card Connor made are two things that made me smile. 2. Whatâ€™s the first thing you do when you get home and walk through the door? Hmmm, well, I want to say that I usually take off my shoes first thing because, hello, I need foot freedom (shoes are so oppressive), but I think what I technically do is lock the door behind me. 3. Whatâ€™s your favorite cereal? Does oatmeal count? If it doesnâ€™t then, itâ€™s Kelloggâ€™s Special K with the dried red strawberries. I donâ€™t really eat it for breakfast, though. Itâ€™s more of a[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 878 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Itâ€™s almost dusk here at Casa de MBB, and weâ€™re getting cleaned up and ready for bed, but I still wanted to wish you a Happy Motherâ€™s Day. Thereâ€™s so much to say about Motherâ€™s Day, isnâ€™t there? It can be an emotional day in many ways for many reasons, different for everyone. People have such different relationships with their parents and their children and all of the creatures they care for, and life is fleeting. We all lose our care givers and loved ones someday, and days like today mean different things to all of us at different times in our lives. I pray and hope your day was good to you. Every Motherâ€™s Day, just like every other day, I also think about Tabs. Oh! â€” sometimes when I see an old picture like this one below, I tear up, especially on Motherâ€™s Day. I sure miss my special boy! Rosie As you may or may not know, Rosie the Magnificent has her own connection to Motherâ€™s Day because she isâ€¦ A mother![Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 860 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
