    "description": "While Mega Man games might vary in gameplay quality, every entry in the series has superb art. Take Mega Man X Dive, for example, which started a smartphone game before jumping to Steam in 2023. While you might expect a mobile spinoff to cut corners, its art direction is just as strong as any other game starring the Blue Bomber, and its nature as a cross-over title means it's packed with awesome-looking characters and remixed designs from across the entire franchise. If you'd like to see the hard work of the illustrators and designers who helped bring it to life, you can preorder the Mega Man X Dive: Official Complete Works book for $50 ahead of its release on March 25, 2025.Mega Man X Dive: Official Complete Works$50This is a 256-page hardcover book that contains character designs, rough concepts, key art, and plenty of creator commentary. There's even a series of interviews with the developers, so you can find out how characters X, Zero, and Axl were designed for the leap to mobile, alongside newcomers like RiCO, iCO, and ViA. The English cover hasn't been released, but since Udon is publishing this, it's highly likely that it'll be the same as the Japanese edition.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "With the ascendancy of streaming services seemingly on the wane thanks to tons of different channels, frustrating and ever-changing licensing deals, and the tendency of corporate masters to just delete shows and movies without fanfare, physical media is seeing a resurgence.

    "description": "Deadlock gives me the shakes. Valve's not-so-secret third-person MOBA shooter is a fiercely competitive game of push and pull through monster-peppered city streets. You'll get into hectic scrapes with a giant blob man and come out of it sweating and swearing, and possibly alive. It is tactical, deep, instinctive, and an interesting work-in-progress. It elicits adrenaline almost as much as it forces murder economics down your piehole.

    "description": "Deep beneath my desk lies a secret shame: impenetrable black thickets of power leads, sprouting forth across two overlapping extension units. Such a failure of cable management pierces my conscience like the beat of Poe's tell-tale heart, and yet Iâ€™m forever powerless â€“ as in, I canâ€™t be bothered â€“ to do anything about it. Yet even I was soothed by the Steam Next Fest demo for Plug It In, a chilled-out puzzle game about clicking chunky plugs into the right outlets. Read more",
