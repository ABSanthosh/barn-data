    "description": "Solo Leveling: Season One Limited Edition $90 | Releases July 22 Preorder at Crunchyroll Store Solo Leveling: Season One Standard Edition $70 | Releases July 22 Preorder at Crunchyroll Store Anime shows inspired by video games aren't exactly in short supply, but if there's one series that best captures the power fantasy of an MMORPG, it's Solo Leveling. For fans looking to own the show's first set of episodes, Solo Leveling: Season One is getting a Blu-ray release on July 22, and preorders are available now exclusively at Crunchyroll, with a $70 standard edition and a $90 Limited Edition up for grabs. Solo Leveling: Season One Limited Edition $90 | Releases July 22 The Solo Leveling: Season One Limited Edition comes in a deluxe slipcase that contains all 12 episodes from the first season, a selection of bonus materials, a 68-page art book, four art cards, and a sticker sheet. Preorder at Crunchyroll Store Solo Leveling: Season One Standard Edition $70 | Releases July 22 Solo Leveling: Season One is also available in a standard edition that includes Blu-ray and DVD copies of the anime's first 12 episodes. While you're miss out on the Limited Edition's physical collectibles, the on-disc bonus material is the same. Preorder at Crunchyroll Store Solo Leveling: Season 1 Blu-ray Special FeaturesThe Limited Edition and standard edition releases both offer the same on-disc bonus features. Here's what's included:Clean opening and closing sequencesInterviews with the show's cast and crewA documentary on Solo LevelingPromotional videosCharacter highlight videosEpisode previewsSolo Leveling is an action-fantasy anime based on the Korean manhwa series and light novel series of the same name. It's set in a fictional version of our world where inter-dimensional monsters invade Earth through mysterious portals that connect to dangerous dungeons, and these creatures can only be stopped by super-powered humans called Hunters. Hunters are divided into ranks, ranging from lowly E-class fighters and up to the elite S-class combatants who wield terrifying powers. The catch here is that a class cannot be improved upon, so if someone were to awaken as an E-class, they'd be stuck at that ranking for the rest of their life.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Minecraft Ultimate Movie Pack (8 Figures) $75 | Releases July 1 Preorder at Amazon The Minecraft movie has only been in theaters for a few weeks, but it's already the second-highest-grossing video game movie of all time. It's also spawned a trove of merchandise, including the upcoming Minecraft Ultimate Movie Pack, which bundles eight figures based on various characters from A Minecraft Movie, including Jack Black's Steve and the rest of the main cast, as well as a few Minecraft monsters like the Creeper, Skeleton, and more. The bundle launches July 1, but preorders are available for $75 at Amazon. Preordering the pack soon is probably a wise move, since other Minecraft Movie merch has sold out quickly. Minecraft Ultimate Movie Pack (8 Figures) $75 | Releases July 1 The Minecraft Ultimate Movie Pack has eight 4-inch scale figures, including:SteveCreeperGarrettHenryDawnNatalieDennis the wolfSkeletonEach figure features multiple points of articulation and comes with a signature accessory. For example, Steve comes with his sword and bag, Garett comes with buckchuckets, and the Skeleton has a bow and arrow. Oh, and the Creeper figure glows in the dark, which is pretty neat. Preorder at Amazon If you're on the hunt for more Minecraft Movie toys and merch, be sure to check Mattel's Minecraft page on Amazon, which has action figures, plushies, play sets, and more.For those who are already looking to preorder the Minecraft Movie on Blu-ray, multiple editions of the film are up at Amazon and Walmart. This includes a $38 limited 4K steelbook edition, a $35 Walmart-exclusive Collector's Crafting Table Edition that features a foldable box that turns into the Minecraft Crafting Table item, and standard edition versions of the movie on 4K, Blu-ray, and DVD. There's no release date announced for any of these Minecraft Movie Blu-rays, but securing your copy now locks you in for the low-price guarantees at Amazon and Walmart, meaning you'll only pay the lowest amount if the price changes between now and launch.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Group chats: love ‘em or leave ‘em? It depends on the group, hahaha! I mostly love ‘em, and for those chats that I wanna leave (but can’t for whatever reason), well, that’s when the mute button comes in handy. 2. Full, medium or sheer? Hmm. For things like face makeup, then medium or sheer, although to be honest medium feels like full coverage for me these days! When it comes to, like, nail polish, though? Opaque all the way. I’ve got no time for sheer nail polish these days. Oh, and does this apply to perfume, too? Because if we’re talking about scents, I’ve been more into medium and sheer scents lately. 3.

    "description": "Sure, Tabs was a great boss, brilliant thinker, a total disruptor who dominated everything he ever tried, but let’s be real… He was a really tough employer.
