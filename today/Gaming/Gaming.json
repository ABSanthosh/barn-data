And this time around, it's the turn of exploration, which is promising to be a little more player-driven and a little less like an explosion in a map marker factory. Read more",

    "description": "Assassin's Creed games usually include a large open world, and Assassin's Creed Shadows is no exception. While there are familiar elements to the travel and exploration abilities in this game, Shadows is also going to allow its two leading characters, Naoe and Yasuke, to take some time to appreciate the beauty of nature by creating art.Ubisoft unveiled this feature during an extended explanation about how the game's exploration mechanics will work. Letting Naoe or Yasuke create art may not give them an edge in battle, but it's an activity that they find rewarding. Yasuke and Naoe will also have their own character-specific activities that they can do outside of quests and missions. For example, Yasuke can find experts who can teach him more about how to use his Kata, which gives his character special attack movies. On the other hand, Naoe's Kuji-kiri meditation will open up more of her backstory.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Kindle Colorsoft $230 (was $280) | Extra 20% off with trade-in See at Amazon Amazon's recently released Kindle Colorsoft is on sale for a substantial discount for the first time since its release last October. For a limited time, you can get Amazon's first full-color e-ink tablet for $230, down from $280. The Prime-exclusive discount gets even better if you have an eligible trade-in device. If you trade-in an old device--it doesn't need to be a Kindle--you'll save an additional 20%.If you want to take notes on your Kindle, Amazon has preowned Kindle Scribe ereaders in like-new condition for as low as $234. You can also secure steep discounts on Kindle Fire HD tablets. Kindle Colorsoft $230 (was $280) | Extra 20% off with trade-in The Kindle Colorsoft has a 7-inch full-color display, eight weeks of battery life, and a front light that automatically adjusts to your surroundings. If you enjoy saving passages in books, the Colorsoft has the added benefit of letting you highlight text in color, making it easier than ever to organize important sentences you want to return to later.Other notable features of the Colorsoft include support for wireless charging, no ads on the lock screen, and 32GB of storage. If you like reading by the pool or relaxing in the bath, the Colorsoft ereader is waterproof and carries an IPX8 water resistance rating, which means it can be fully submerged in water at a depth of 6.5 feet for up to 60 minutes.The biggest reason to pick up the Colorsoft is if you’re interested in making the jump to digital comic books and graphic novels. Its color display is leagues better for the format than black and white ereaders like the standard Kindle--and at $230, it’s easier to recommend. See at Amazon As mentioned, you can save even more with an eligible trade-in item. You'll automatically save an additional 20%, even if you send Amazon a cheap device like a Fire Stick. The 20% is calculated from the sale price, so in this case, you'll save an extra $46 simply for trading in any eligible device. At the moment, that means the Colorsoft's price drops to $184.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

But I know that you are a busy person, so I will jam it all into a single sentence: a Twitter account purporting to be a Silksong developer has posted a tweet that seemingly predicts the Switch 2 announcement while using a profile picture of some cake taken from a recipe book that was published on 2nd April 2024 which is exactly a year before 2nd April 2025 which is the date of the Nintendo Direct teased in the Switch 2 announcement.

    "description": "There’s a lot you can do with a third dimension. Texture. Nativity dioramas. Spheres. Hyper Light Breaker, in expanding from the 2D action of Hyper Light Drifter, chooses to almost entirely remake itself as a free-roaming roguelike, trading post-apocalyptic pixel art for big proc-gen vistas and even more acrobatic swordplay. Its technical ambition, sadly, ends up undermined by the emptiness of its world, the lack of exploratory pleasure that Drifter nurtured so well, and combat that’s more faithful to the original yet doesn’t quite adapt well enough to 3D. Not to mention it has more than its fair share of early access bugs and, especially in the early stages, balancing missteps. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. How late do you stay up at night? If it’s all working out to plan, then I’ll be asleep by 9:30. Typically, though, I’m asleep between 10-11. And if I’ve got insomnia, then I’ll see you at the witching hour, ha! 2. Last photo you took? Connor and I were at Nordstrom Rack yesterday to look for a dress for the father-daughter dance, and we saw a very colorful men’s t-shirt with a swimming white tiger swimming. It had sequins on it, too! I couldn’t help but take a picture of it because it make me chuckle. 3. What’s your scent of the day? Wearing an old fave today, Dolce \u0026 Gabanna The One. 4. Are you a person who likes to snack throughout the day?

    "description": "Rosie hasn’t been taking the best care of herself. She’s been so busy at work with all of the scientific papers she published last year that she hasn’t been eating as well as she should, and she hasn’t been exercising. But that’s in the past now. It’s January 2025, and that means new year’s resolutions. Fur starters…fitness! 😸 Rosie got a membership to The Hello Kitty Bounce House, a new cat fitness gym. It’s the latest craze in feline fitness. They say that 10 minutes of bouncing burns as many calories as 12 hours of napping! That sounded great to Rosie, so she signed up for a year. But that’s not all. She also started playing pickleball. Marnie was already an avid runner last year, so she didn’t officially set a “fitness resolution,” but she did want to show her manager Rosie that she’s a team player… So, she’s decided to try out for the new season of American Ninja Warrior!
