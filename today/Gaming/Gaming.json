    "description": "For decades now, I’ve proudly proclaimed myself as a crazy cat lady, and last Saturday, I found my people at Mini Cat Town in San Rafael. Mini Cat Town is a non-profit adoption safe haven for kittens in the Santa Rosa Plaza, which is about 45 minutes north of where I live in Marin County. Cats roam freely in a big room and interact with cat lovers and potential adopters. To visit with the kitties, you pay a small fee to enter, and then you get 30 minutes to hang out and play. How I managed to leave without adopting a kitty or two or five or 10 is honestly a mystery to me, LOL! I was immediately drawn to a handsome orange tabby boy named Teddy! Just look at his face. He’s a super meow-dal, for sure. He was very sweet, fun and outgoing, and when I picked him up he immediately melted into my arms, just like Tabs used to do. I couldn’t help but wonder for a moment if Tabs was trying[Continue reading...] The post Let’s Go to Mini Cat Town! appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. How late do you stay up at night? If it’s all working out to plan, then I’ll be asleep by 9:30. Typically, though, I’m asleep between 10-11. And if I’ve got insomnia, then I’ll see you at the witching hour, ha! 2. Last photo you took? Connor and I were at Nordstrom Rack yesterday to look for a dress for the father-daughter dance, and we saw a very colorful men’s t-shirt with a swimming white tiger swimming. It had sequins on it, too! I couldn’t help but take a picture of it because it make me chuckle. 3. What’s your scent of the day? Wearing an old fave today, Dolce \u0026 Gabanna The One. 4. Are you a person who likes to snack throughout the day?

    "description": "Marvel Snap was made unavailable in the US shortly after the TikTok ban went into effect on January 19. This was presumably because the game's publisher, Nuverse, was owned at the time of its release by TikTok parent company Bytedance. However, TikTok has now come back online, but Marvel Snap hasn't yet.\"Unfortunately, Marvel Snap is temporarily unavailable in U.S. app stores and is unavailable to play in the US. This outage is a surprise to us and wasn't planned,\" said Marvel Snap developer Second Dinner. \"Marvel Snap isn’t going anywhere. We’re actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.\"Marvel Snap has also disappeared from app stores and even if you have it installed, you can't currently play it.In under 24 hours since its ban in the US, TikTok has restored service. Marvel Snap, at this time, however, is still unavailable for US players. It's unknown when and if the game will come back online.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Assassin's Creed games usually include a large open world, and Assassin's Creed Shadows is no exception. While there are familiar elements to the travel and exploration abilities in this game, Shadows is also going to allow its two leading characters, Naoe and Yasuke, to take some time to appreciate the beauty of nature by creating art.Ubisoft unveiled this feature during an extended explanation about how the game's exploration mechanics will work. Letting Naoe or Yasuke create art may not give them an edge in battle, but it's an activity that they find rewarding. Yasuke and Naoe will also have their own character-specific activities that they can do outside of quests and missions. For example, Yasuke can find experts who can teach him more about how to use his Kata, which gives his character special attack movies. On the other hand, Naoe's Kuji-kiri meditation will open up more of her backstory.Continue Reading at GameSpot",
