I’ve got the old school version in the black packaging, RIP. NARS reformulated their lip crayon line into what they call the Powermattes, and you know, sometimes I wonder why brands don’t just leave well enough alone. Anywho, I like the color of the older version, which I think is slightly cooler and more magenta. Two things before I head out! One, for some reason I always want to call this lipstick “Dragon Roll,” like it’s a type of sushi, hahaha! The second is that if I look a little dazed and confused in these pictures (which I took right before heading into the office), it’s because my co-worker caught me taking selfies, and I was kinda embarrassed to be having a full-on photo shoot in my car so early in the morning. 🙂 What lip color are you wearing today?
