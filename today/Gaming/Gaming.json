I’m setting the bar pretty low and giving myself the option of wearing the same color a few times, but I’m hoping that I’ll feel motivated to do a new color every day.

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Something nice someone did for you recently? My friend took me out to tea yesterday. I don’t know what it is about those tiny little sandwiches and a hot pot of earl grey, but it does a lot for my soul. 2. What’s your favorite holiday?

Driving next to big semi-trucks on the freeway that are going waaaaaay too fast. 4. My favorite weekday lunch is? Roasted red pepper pasta with garbanzo beans and basil topped with lots of parmesan cheese. YUM! 5. Something you accomplished over the weekend? I made myself take some downtime and did absolutely nothing housework related.[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 852 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
