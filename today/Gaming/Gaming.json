    "description": "From the moment that Shadow the Hedgehog appeared in the first trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog 3, it seemed obvious that Sega's antihero was going to be the sequel's breakout character. But few could have predicted that it would mean Sonic 3's Build-a-Bear line would be disrupted by Shadow's resurgence.As reported by Kotaku, Shadow's Build-a-Bear is sold out and going for ludicrous prices on eBay from $300 on the low end to $1,500 at the highest. Currently, the highest amount that anyone has actually paid on eBay for Shadow is just north of $600. That's still quite a mark up from the other currently available characters, as you can see below. Note that Tails is an online exclusive, while Sonic is available both online and in stores. Sonic Build-A-Bear -- $34Tails Build-A-Bear -- $34Tails Build-A-Bear with sound -- $42 See all Sonic Build-a-Bear plushies Shadow has been removed from Build-a-Bear's site, and the company reportedly has no plans to restock the character. That seems counterintuitive, given the clear demand. And the only way to cool off the secondary market for Shadow Build-a-Bears would be if there were enough to meet the demand.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Path of Exile 2 is out now in early access ahead of its 1.0 launch in the future. Naturally, that means the game will change a lot over the months ahead. While the ARPG will feature three acts of the campaign, a portion of the 12 classes, and additional content, there's still more to come as time goes on. Though the early access version of Path of Exile 2 went live on December 6, there is a key stipulation to gaining access; the game will eventually be free-to-play, but to play during the early access period, you'll need to pay up.You can find out how much you need to pay and other details about Path of Exile 2's launch in the guide below.How much is Path of Exile 2 Early Access?Early access to Path of Exile 2 costs some money.The early access version of Path of Exile 2 costs $30. That $30 is spent on an Early Access Supporter Pack, which gives you a Path of Exile 2 early access key as well as 300 Points and the extended digital soundtrack. The Points can be used to purchase items in the Path of Exile 2 shop and are technically a $30 value on their own.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Currently on show at CES 2025, it’s a prototype desktop build that uses clever geometry and an unconventional motherboard I/O layout to hide practically every single wire in the joint, for a clean design that's housed for your viewing pleasure within a four-sided glass chamber. It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it. The problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case. And there is a one hundred percent chance I will ruin it. Read more",

    "description": "Tabs was world renowned for his ambitious new year’s resolutions, whether it was training for the Iron Cat Triathlon, studying for the MCCATs (Medical Cat College Admission Test) or committing to walk in all four of the year’s big feline fashion shows — the so-called Grand Slam of kitty supermeowdelry. But his goals weren’t always epic. Sometimes, they were something simple… My darlings, The new year is upon us, and, with that, many new year’s resolutions.
