See at Amazon This collection offers a great way to experience two of the most important RPGs from the 16-bit and 32-bit console eras. The original Lunar: Silver Star Story is considered a landmark title in the Japanese RPG lineage and was one of the first console RPGs to feature voice acting, animated cutscenes, and CD-quality music thanks to its original platform, the Sega CD. It was later remade for PS1 and Sega Saturn as Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete, which is the version included in the Lunar Remastered Collection. Its sequel, Lunar 2: Eternal Blue, also launched on PS1 and Saturn and built upon the gameplay and story presentation of the first game, featuring even more voiced dialogue and a larger cast.Continue Reading at GameSpot",
