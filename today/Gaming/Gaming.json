    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. How late do you stay up at night? If it’s all working out to plan, then I’ll be asleep by 9:30. Typically, though, I’m asleep between 10-11. And if I’ve got insomnia, then I’ll see you at the witching hour, ha! 2. Last photo you took? Connor and I were at Nordstrom Rack yesterday to look for a dress for the father-daughter dance, and we saw a very colorful men’s t-shirt with a swimming white tiger swimming. It had sequins on it, too! I couldn’t help but take a picture of it because it make me chuckle. 3. What’s your scent of the day? Wearing an old fave today, Dolce \u0026 Gabanna The One. 4.

    "description": "Rosie hasn’t been taking the best care of herself. She’s been so busy at work with all of the scientific papers she published last year that she hasn’t been eating as well as she should, and she hasn’t been exercising. But that’s in the past now. It’s January 2025, and that means new year’s resolutions. Fur starters…fitness! 😸 Rosie got a membership to The Hello Kitty Bounce House, a new cat fitness gym. It’s the latest craze in feline fitness. They say that 10 minutes of bouncing burns as many calories as 12 hours of napping! That sounded great to Rosie, so she signed up for a year. But that’s not all. She also started playing pickleball. Marnie was already an avid runner last year, so she didn’t officially set a “fitness resolution,” but she did want to show her manager Rosie that she’s a team player… So, she’s decided to try out for the new season of American Ninja Warrior!
