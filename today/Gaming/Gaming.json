This deal is only available in limited quantities, and nearly 50% of these blasters have been claimed. See at Amazon One of the most iconic weapons in the Halo series, the Needler is known for its rapid rate of fire. To imitate Covenant Grunts' go-to weapon, Nerf installed a motor in the blaster.

    "description": "A handful of Nintendo exclusives are down to some of their best prices of the year in Walmart's Black Friday sale, giving you a chance to grab iconic Mario and Zelda games for just $30 each. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is arguably the most enticing offer of the bunch. This was the first game Nintendo charged $70 for, but you can grab it for just $30--meaning you’ll save an impressive $40 with Walmart’s current price cut. See at Walmart While several other games were also part of the $30 discount earlier in the week, most have sold out. Luckily, a few notable titles remain in stock, including Super Mario Odyssey and Super Mario Maker 2, discounting both games from their $60 list price to $30. Super Mario Odyssey is still considered one of the best 3D platformers of all time, and Super Mario Maker 2 is a wonderful choice for anyone who has ever wanted to create their own Mario levels. Nintendo Switch Sports physical edition is also down to $30 (was $50). This package includes the full game and the Joy-Con Leg Stap accessory.A few third-party exclusives are also on sale at or below $30, including Disney Epic Mickey Rebrushed, Sonic X Shadow Generations, Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble, and Hogwarts Legacy. Check the list below for all the $30 Switch game deals at Walmart.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Stuffing or mashed potatoes? Both speak volumes to my carb-loving heart, but I love mashed potatoes just a little bit more. 2. Apple pie or apple cider? Um, both? 3. Do you have any Thanksgiving day traditions? Not really, although I do short circuit if I don’t get at least one slice of pecan pie. I gotta have it! 4. Have you ever hosted Thanksgiving? Yes, a handful of times, and yes, there was pecan pie. HAHAHA! 5. Something you’re thankful for? So thankful to spend time with my little family of El Hub, Connor, Rosie and Marnie. Our house is full and so is my heart! Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment.

    "description": "As most people know, Tabs was a demanding employer. He was also very fair to his employees. More than generous, actually. In keeping with his holiday traditions, Rosie allowed us to take the next two weeks off (thank you so much, Rosie!). Consequently, the employees of Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC have been up to their vacation shenanigans, which for me meant blogging while dressed up as a cat lady lumberjack. Makeup, of course, has been on Connor’s agenda, but she’s still perfecting her technique… Marnie has been cruisin’ the streets of Novato looking for tiny dogs with short legs to bark at — that is, when Connor isn’t demanding that they play dress-up together. We’ve all been enjoying this joyful break before Thanksgiving. I hope things are going well with you, too. We’re here and we’re feisty (just tired). 😊 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 839 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Sony's PlayStation 5 Pro is the most capable console money can buy right now, so it's only right that we should see Epic's Fortnite receive a substantial upgrade. The Pro's extra rasterisation performance is put to good use in delivering higher resolutions up against the standard model, but that's not really the game-changing difference. Instead, Epic deploys its higher end hardware ray tracing features to the 60fps mode of the game, offering a much improved level of global illumination and reflections - and it does so while maintaining its nigh-on flawless performance level. It's also interesting to note that one of Sony's 'big three' enhancements isn't used. Epic prefers its own Temporal Super Resolution technology (TSR) instead of the Pro's machine learning-based PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR). Read more",
