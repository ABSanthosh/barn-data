    "description": "It's been just one week since the Switch 2 launched on June 5, yet it's already smashing sales records, and it's easy to see why. The highly anticipated new console offers big upgrades over the original Switch, including the ability to play games at 4K resolution and up to 120fps, a larger screen with HDR and VRR support, redesigned Joy-Con 2 Controllers that can even work as mice, and more. But as exciting as the new hardware is, the real draw is the new games. The Switch 2 already has a stacked lineup of titles, including launch titles like Mario Kart World and Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition, and big upcoming releases like Donkey Kong Bananza, Pokemon Legends: Z-A, and more. So whether you've already secured your Switch 2, or you're planning to pick one up later, you've got plenty of games to look forward to. To help you see what the new console already has on offer, we've rounded up all the Switch 2 physical games you can buy or preorder right now into the list below. While several are already available, many more are also launching in the coming weeks. We'll also be updating the list with notable new physical releases as they're announced.Note that we're focusing on games with dedicated, physical Switch 2 editions. There are many more games available for the system that aren't on this list, including eShop games, classic Nintendo games on NSO, and original Switch games with digital-only Switch 2 upgrades--not to mention the hundreds of Switch games you can play on Switch 2 via backward compatibility.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "After a decade of anticipation from Dragon Age fans, the most-recent sequel, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, arrived last fall and was promptly labeled a disappointment by EA. Despite Dragon Age: Inquisition winning several game of the year awards 10 years earlier, The Veilguard simply wasn't as well-received among fans. Now, a new report is shedding light on The Veilguard's troubled development and why it failed.Bloomberg has offered a comprehensive look back at Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but perhaps the most surprising thing is how much of the story was already known. One of the most common refrains in the report is that BioWare was hamstrung by the initial plans to make The Veilguard a live-service title. Even switching back to a single-player game didn't allow the team to recapture the fully-realized stories and options that the previous titles had.The report also appears to confirm the account of former Dragon Age series lead writer David Gaider, who previously spoke about tension between the Dragon Age and Mass Effect teams at BioWare. Even when the two teams were brought together for The Veilguard, the tribalism remained.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So‚Ä¶what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn‚Äôt, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It‚Äôs just a list of more or less random questions I‚Äôve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Loose or fitted t-shirts? Generally, I like my tees slightly loose-y goose-y if I‚Äôm wearing them with jeans or shorts. If I‚Äôm layering with a sweater or a sweatshirt on top, then fitted. 2. What‚Äôs the oldest thing in your makeup bag right now? Hmm, the brushes? Oh, and I‚Äôm almost embarrassed to say this out loud, but I have an ancient Nordstrom Naturals MAC palette that I bust out every so often. 3. How‚Äôs your June going so far? It‚Äôs been very, very busy with end-of-the-year activities, dance things and whatnot. Things will kinda slow down after June 30, which I‚Äôm looking forward to. 4. How do you feel about walking around in sandals or flip flops without your toenails painted? I like my toe nails[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 882 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

What time do you usually wake up in the morning? These days, 6 in the morning. Ideally my day would start off at 5:30, though. 2. How organized is your purse? It‚Äôs on the verge of haphazard, always, LOL! I mean, I can find the usual things I absolutely need ‚Äì my phone, wallet, keys, medication, lipgloss. But do I find those things in an efficient manner? No. 3. If you could make one rule that everyone around you had to follow, what would it be? Make your deadlines. I can‚Äôt stand it when people are casual about due dates! 4. How do you feel about wearing makeup when it‚Äôs hot? I‚Äôll do it, but I don‚Äôt like to do too many layers.
