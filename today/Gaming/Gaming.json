    "description": "After months of speculation, A24 has reportedly confirmed that a live-action Elden Ring movie is in the works. The project is said to be helmed by Alex Garland (Ex Machina, Annihilation, Civil War), who is set to both write and direct the upcoming film.Though several outlets have speculated on the film's existence the past few months, Deadline reported it officially confirmed earlier today. In addition to Garland, a few other names have been attached to the film. Most notably is George R. R. Martin, who famously collaborated with Elden Ring studio From Software to help write the game's backstory. Meanwhile, Peter Rice, and DNA's Andrew MacDonald and Allon Reich, are all set to produce.The news comes shortly after the release of Garland's latest film, Warfare, which was also made in partnership with A24 and has currently grossed over $32 million since releasing last month. It also comes just ahead of the release of Elden Ring: Nightreign, an Elden Ring spin-off game that focuses on cooperative, PvE gameplay and it set to release on May 30.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What did you have for breakfast? Protein smoothie with whey protein powder, greek yogurt, unsweetened almond milk and fruit (apples and strawberries). It’s easy, doesn’t require turning on the stove and it keeps me full for hours. 2. How did you do your hair today? I’m wearing it down, with soft, barely there waves. Kinda boring but it’s practical for me because it takes about five minutes to style. Plus wearing it down helps with the migraines (I get bad ones). 3. What’s your favorite summer month? June. It’s the end of the school year, and you feel like the whole summer is ahead of you! It’s also warm but not too hot yet. Oh, and it’s my birthday month, too. Yay, to all my cray-cray geminis![Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 879 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Crisis between colleagues! Today, a special meeting of the Board of Directors of Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC was called to review a most disturbing matter — the repeated and inexplicable disappearance of Chief Feline Officer Rosie’s crunchies. At various times over the past few weeks, Rosie’s food bowl, which had been previously full, has become empty, and as you can imagine, this caused quite a corporate kerfuffle. The results of an internal investigation were inconclusive, but Rosie thinks she knows who’s doing it… Since the official investigation was inconclusive, the board hasn’t taken any action, but Rosie’s suspicions have created a lot of tension… Unfortunately for Marnie, she has a lengthy record of snack theft, so her history isn’t doing her any favors. Plus, she was captured on security footage early this morning in the vicinity of Rosie’s food bowl. When asked about it by the company investigator, Marnie lawyered up… I just hope this gets resolved soon because it’s been bad for morale in the office. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 861 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
