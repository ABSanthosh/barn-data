    "description": "Fantastical football sim Rematch has, we’re told, a passing problem. Specifically, no-one is doing it. While I suspect this dearth of teamplay is exaggerated in the darkness of upset Steam forum posts, I definitely remember a lot of ballhogging going on in the third person booter’s open beta. It sounds to me, then, that Rematch is suffering from the same issue you get in low-ranked Dota 2 lobbies: everyone wants to be the superstar, the one who ends the match with the biggest numbers next to their name, oblivious to how few instances of the letter 'I' occur in the word 'Team'. It’s very few, people. Clearly, what’s needed is someone willing to do the dirty work as a passing-focused support character, and today, that would be me. I’d score no goals and seek no glory, only defending, distracting, and most importantly, promoting the redistribution of stitched leather orbs. Read more",

    "description": "Rosie should have known better than to trust Marnie with Rosie’s investments. After all, Marnie doesn’t have any background or credentials or expertise in financial planning. There was no reason to think Marnie would be able to manage Rosie’s assets, but Rosie wanted to give her a chance. Oh, well. Bad move on Rosie’s part. Even someone of Rosie’s intellectual stature screws up sometimes. Sure, she may understand quantum physics better than any other cat on the planet, but that doesn’t mean she understands compound interest. Sigh… Now Rosie has to think of a way of to recoup all those losses. Hmm… What could she invent?

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you keep backups of your favorite products? These days, the only backups I buy are things I know I’ll finish on a regular basis (like shampoo and conditioner, or body lotion). I don’t even bother with makeup backups anymore, though.
