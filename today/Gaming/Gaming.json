These are limited-time Amazon deals, so you'll want to snag them as soon as possible. Arcane's 4K Limited Edition Steelbook is available for only $41 (was $60), while the standard Blu-ray Limited Edition Steelbook is discounted to $37.33 (was $55). That means you can get both for roughly $88 (was $115). And big Arcane fans may actually want both, because each steelbook features one of the main characters: Jinx (4K) or Vi (1080p).With the second and final season of Arcane set to premiere on Netflix on November 2, it's the perfect time to watch the stellar animated show.
