    "description": "Manga publisher Kodansha is launching the next entries in the Vinland Saga: Deluxe Edition manga series with Deluxe Edition 7 and Deluxe Edition 8 later this year. Vinland Saga: Deluxe Edition 7 is currently scheduled to arrive on May 6 and is priced at $49.50, while Vinland Saga: Deluxe Edition 8 will land on August 5 and is priced at $55. Preorders for both releases are now available at Amazon. Vinland Saga: Deluxe Edition 7 $49.50 (was $55) | Releases May 6 Like the previous releases, Vinland Saga Deluxe Edition 7 and Deluxe Edition 8 are oversized 7 x 10\" format books. Both volumes are roughly 600 pages long and include several exclusive sketches and drafts from illustrator Makoto Yukimura that you won't find in the other manga editions.Vinland Saga: Deluxe Edition 7 covers volumes 19-21 of the original manga and features a dark green leather-patterned cover with stamped Norse runes. Preorders are discounted to $49.40 at Amazon (normally $55) ahead of its May 6 release date. Preorder at Amazon Vinland Saga: Deluxe Edition 8 $55 | Releases August 5 Vinland Saga: Deluxe Edition 8 contains volumes 22-24 and launches on August 5. In the manga source material, these are the volumes that wrapped up the Eastern Expedition arc and saw the start of the Vinland story arc. While the final cover art has not been revealed, we assume it will match the style of the other Deluxe Editions with its own unique color. Preorders are available for $55 at Amazon. Preorder at Amazon Vinland Saga is a critically acclaimed manga series that started back in 2005. The series initially covered the journey of Thorfinn, a young warrior who had joined up with a band of mercenaries so that he could get revenge on its leader, Askeladd, for the death of his father. While these early storylines were action-heavy tales of intrigue and war, Vinland Saga would evolve and use these bloody tales to ask questions about the nature of conflict, revenge, and finding a better way to solve problems, particularly in the Slave arc. The storytelling has been widely praised over the years, but its historical attention to detail and Makoto's incredible artwork have also been big draws. If you'd like to read it for yourself, the other hardcover Deluxe Editions are discounted at Amazon.Vinland Saga Deluxe Edition Manga CollectionsVinland Saga: Deluxe Edition 1 -- $39 ($55)Vinland Saga: Deluxe Edition 2 -- $35.85 ($55)Vinland Saga: Deluxe Edition 3 -- $33.49 ($55)Vinland Saga: Deluxe Edition 4 -- $41.32 ($55)Vinland Saga: Deluxe Edition 5 -- $49.49 ($55)Vinland Saga: Deluxe Edition 6 -- $39.55 ($55)Vinland Saga: Deluxe Edition 7 -- $49.49 ($55) | Releases May 6Vinland Saga: Deluxe Edition 8 -- $55 | Releases August 5 Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Shrimp or crab? Crab, but it can’t be imitation, and it has to be fresh. 2. Yoga or pilates? Both are equally as challenging for this very out-of-shape lady at the moment. LOL! (Been a rough 12 months.) I’ll pick yoga; I could use a good stretch. 3. Something that makes you feel sentimental? When my phone brings up baby photos of Connor or old photos of Tabs before he got sick. My heart swells up every single time. 4. What book are you reading at the moment? Nothing at the moment, boo. I need a good one. Got anything to suggest? I would like something not too heavy or scary. 5. Something you wish you said no to sooner? I wish I would’ve said no to[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 868 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "It’s the Super Bowl! As you know, before Tabs rocked the world by reinventing kitty supermodeling, he entertained millions as a professional cat football player. In fact, he won the Kitty Bowl a record eight times, making him more accomplished than even Tom Brady. Yes, Tabs was quite the cat athlete. Today’s game starts in a few minutes, and while Tabs is no longer here to watch the game with me, I’m sure he’ll be watching from up above. This happens to also be the last Sunday before Valentine’s. Marnie and Rosie are both more interested in that aspect of the day than the football. I can appreciate that. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S.
