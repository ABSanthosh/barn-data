    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you keep backups of your favorite products? These days, the only backups I buy are things I know I’ll finish on a regular basis (like shampoo and conditioner, or body lotion). I don’t even bother with makeup backups anymore, though. If I finish something like a blush or an eyebrow pencil, great, and if it’s still around when it’s time to restock, that’s even better. If it’s discontinued, I might mourn it a little bit, but there’s always something new coming out, and I don’t mind trying new things, so I don’t stress about it too much. 2.

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you have a favorite vegetable? Yes! Carrots, for sure. The fact that you can turn them into a cake is a big deal! I mean, come on, have you ever heard of a broccoli cake? Or an okra cake? Yeah, I didn’t think so, LOL! I also love that you can put them in salads, roast them or just eat them plain with a variety of different dips. 2.
