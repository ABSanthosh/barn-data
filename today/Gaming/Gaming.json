We wouldn't head far, and there'd be no objective in mind. It was just the perfect way - chill, airy, bright - to begin another twelve months of whatever the world had in store for us. Read more",

    "description": "Marvel Rivals has hit some major milestones since its launch a month ago, including reaching 20 million players. The Overwatch competitor features a huge roster, including the now beloved Jeff the Land Shark, and while NetEase has already confirmed some of the heroes being added in Season 1, there have also been almost a dozen leaked heroes as well. While it's unlikely that all of those heroes arrive in Season 1, it does seem possible that there could be even more than the ones officially confirmed. The new season will also include new team-ups, new maps, and a new battle pass, along with new cosmetic items in the shop. Here's everything we know about Marvel Rivals Season 1 so far. Marvel Rivals Season 1 Start DateWhile the start date of Marvel Rivals Season 1 hasn't been confirmed, Season 0 is set to end Thursday, January 9 at 10 PM PST / January 10 at 1 AM EST. Since this is the first new season since the launch of Marvel Rivals, it's unclear if Season 1 will start immediately or if there will be some server downtime, but it seems like January 10 is the most likely start date. When Season 1 kicks off, it will include a new battle pass, which should be longer than the Season 0 battle pass. Don't worry though, Marvel Rivals battle passes don't expire, so you can keep working on the Season 0 battle pass if you haven't finished. Marvel Rivals Season 1 Confirmed New HeroesSeveral new heroes have been officially confirmed as coming to Marvel Rivals, with NetEase teasing a trailer for January 6 featuring the first official look at the Fantastic Four. At the moment, it's not clear if all four will be added at the start of the season, but the tweet refers to them as a unit, \"Marvel's first family,\" so it seems all four will debut at the start of the season. That includes Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and Thing. While the exact classes of each character haven't been revealed yet, Thing seems like an obvious Vanguard (tank) and Human Torch may be a Duelist (DPS). Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman seem likely to provide at least one Strategist (support) between them, if not both, especially since most of Marvel Rivals' roster is made up of Duelists, but we will have to wait for official confirmation. Marvel Rivals Season 1 Leaked CharactersWhile it seems probable that the Fantastic Four are the only heroes added in Season 1, there have been a lot of leaked heroes for Marvel Rivals that could also join the roster in Season 1, perhaps as part of a mid-season update. These leaked heroes could also get added in future seasons or could potentially get scrapped entirely. Below is a list of the leaked heroes, coming from multiple leakers on Twitter, @MRivalsUpdates and @RivalsLeaks.Leaked heroes:AngelaBladeCaptain MarvelDeadpoolEmma FrostHit-MonkeyJean Grey (Phoenix)M.O.D.O.K.The HoodUltron (believed to be a Season 1 hero)Valkyrie Marvel Rivals Season 1 MapsNetEase hasn't confirmed new maps for Season 1 just yet, but there have been some leaks. Leaker @FumoLeaks found three locations believed to be coming in Season 1. The first two are Krakoa and Arakkoe, islands that the X-Men inhabit in some comic storylines, as well as a New York City map. Similar to other locations in Marvel Rivals, these might contain multiple maps for different game modes, the way that Wakanda features both payload and point capture maps already in Marvel Rivals. Leaker @XOX_Leak also tweeted \"New York = EMPIRE OF ETERNAL NIGHT.\" Based on some text from Cloak and Dagger's character bio and some dialogue they share with Spider-Man in match, Dracula has control of New York, which might influence the design of the maps. The same leaker also shared that Thebes, Egypt is also going to be a map in the future. Marvel Rivals Season 1 Team-UpsTeam-ups in Marvel Rivals are bonus abilities or buffs that are activated when the required characters are on the same team. Some of these bonuses are listed as seasonal boosts, so it's not yet clear if old team-ups will be replaced or if more team-ups are just being added, but leakers have found a number of potential team-ups ahead of official confirmation from NetEase. It's not clear if these team-ups are set for Season 1, especially since some of them include characters that have not been officially confirmed. This list comes from @XOX_Leak and likely isn't representative of all Season 1 new team-ups.Squirrel Girl X Rocket RacoonStorm X Human TorchWolverine X The Thing X HulkWolverine X PhoenixWolverine X Magik X Psylocke X Black Panther (potentially scrapped according to leakers)Blade X Cloak and Dagger X Moon KnightEmma Frost X MagnetoEmma Frost X Psylocke",

The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. \"Bioshock Infinite in space\", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.

    "description": "I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagne-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang. In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation. Read more",

    "description": "Happy New Year, friend! I sincerely believe 2025 will bring us so many wonderful things, including good health, joy and adventure! Connor and I spent the last day of 2024 soaking up art at the SF Museum of Modern Art, aka the SF MOMA and one of my favorite places in the world, with some of our favorite people. It was so nurturing for my soul to be surrounded by beautiful art and kind friends. ‘Twas the purr-fect way to wrap up the year. We were there primarily to see the Amy Sherald exhibit; you might know her from her famous painting of First Lady Michelle Obama. My favorite painting from the exhibit is this one of a young woman and her bike on a summer day. It’s called “A Midsummer Afternoon Dream.” This one called “Innocent You, Innocent Me,” is Connor’s favorite. I discovered a couple new-to-me artists to get excited about, like Yayoi Kusama, who does lots of colorful work, especially with polka dots. There was a room that she made with crazy[Continue reading...] The post SF MOMA on the Last Day of 2024 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What do you need to do the most: rest, get organized or connect with others? All of the above! Right now, the thing I need most is to get organized, though. Since October, I’ve felt like I’ve been pulled along by external forces, and I don’t want to feel like that anymore. I want to feel like I’m in charge of where my life is going, you know? 2. Who would you rather hang out with: Santa Claus, Snoop Dog, the aliens (let’s assume they’re friendly) or Cupid? Santa Claus, of course! He’s my homeboy. Together we make magic happen. 3. Which would you rather do: visit a haunted house, fly a plane, sing in front of an audience or try rock climbing on actual rocks?
