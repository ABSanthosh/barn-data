    "description": "Persona 5 + Persona 5 Royal: Official Design Works $62.20 (was $75) See at Amazon Persona 5 + Persona 5 Royal: Official Design Works is on sale for its lowest price yet. Published by Udon Entertainment last November with a retail price of $75, this 500-page doorstopper of a book is discounted to $62.20 at Amazon. It's marked as a limited-time deal, though it's unclear when the promotion expires.If you're interested in picking up a book that takes an in-depth look at the art direction of one of the most stylish games in its genre, you probably shouldn't wait too long. Official Design Works books covering older entries in the Persona and Shin Megami Tensei series have been out of print for years. Persona 5 + Persona 5 Royal: Official Design Works $62.20 (was $75) This is essentially a two-in-one art book, as you're getting a look at both Persona 5 and its enhanced and expanded edition, Persona 5 Royal. Because it covers two games, this newly translated work is bigger than the average video game art book. The 544-page hardcover is filled with artwork from the earliest stages of development to materials used to promote the finished games.The concept art, sketches, character illustrations, and design drawings are accompanied by commentary from the development team throughout. It also includes an exclusive interview with Persona series artist Shigenori Soejima. See at Amazon If you haven't played it, Persona 5 tells the story of the Phantom Thieves, high school students who save people from the twisted desires of those around them by awakening the power of their true selves. It's wonderfully weird stuff, and worth checking out. It's available on all modern platforms, and since it has been out for a few years, you can get a pretty good deal on a game that'll keep you occupied for dozens of hours. If you really want to spoil yourself, you can also check out this collector's edition for Persona 5 Royal. The 1 More Edition is sold out for Nintendo Switch and Xbox, but Amazon still has a few PS5 copies.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The latter adds living spaceships together with new civics, traits and megastructures, but I'm more interested in the 4.0 update, which they're branding the \"phoenix update\" in that it aims to overhaul performance problems caused by the 4X game's update-bloated systems, while making \"guidance and pacing\" changes with new players in mind. It doesn't sound nearly as exciting on the surface as living spaceships, I'll grant you, but this is a 4X game, don't forget - the mythological firebird is in the detail. Read more",

Here is our verdict on Assassin's Creed Shadows ♫ Nic: To kick off this verdict, I have no choice but to ask my most insightful question: how Assassin-y is this Assassin's Creed Game? Jeremy: This is the first AssCreed game I’ve engaged with since Assassin’s Creed II, which I watched my roommate play through in university. So my opinion is not especially scientific, but from what I’ve seen it is very Assassin-y. The story – which is serviceable if not anything original – revolves around tackling a group of masked bad guys known as the Onryo (that’s Japanese for ghost), who are introduced with cool chanbara-style music. You’ve got to kill all of them, and sometimes you have to kill other folks who are connected with them, and in general there is a whole lot of assassinating going on, either with Naoe (who slices and dices with the standard hidden blade) or Yasuke (who has a ‘brutal’ assassination where he shoves his katana into someone’s face).

    "description": "Yup, the boss lady wants us to tighten our belts around here. It looks like the economy is slowing down a bit, so no more Tuesday all-you-can-eat turkey or free five-egg omelets in the cafeteria. She wants everyone in the company to cut back, and that includes Rosie and Marnie. Starting immediately, there will be no more kibble showers! The leadership committee is hard at work identifying opportunities for process improvement… Rosie and CHO (Chief Hugging Officer) Whiskers are upping the napping quota by a staggering 15%! That means more hugs for everyone! Or else!!! It’s gonna be rough for a while. Hopefully things turn around soon. I have faith in Rosie’s leadership ability. And where many leaders lack empathy, she really goes out of her way to show she cares about people. It’s very motivating! Marnie is totally fired up about it. I sure wish Tabs were still around because he was so good at business. He would have known how to navigate a downturn better than anyone. 😊 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict,[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 855 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What eye makeup products have been on repeat with you lately? Maybelline Lash Sensational Sky High Mascara (eh, it’s just OK), Stila Liquid Liner Micro Tip (it’s pretty good) and good ol’ Anastasia Brow Pencil. 2. How good are you about finding clothes that fit you well? I used to be OK at it, but now, I don’t really enjoy in-person shopping as much as I used to, so I don’t spend the time that one really needs to find the things that fit great. There’s always something a little off with my clothes and I just kinda live with it. Blergh! On the bright side, at least my outfit is always ironed and somewhat matching. 3. How good are you about resisting impulse purchases?
