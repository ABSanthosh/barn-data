    "description": "Gearbox has revealed a new story trailer for its looter-shooter Borderlands 4. While it was brief, it did reveal a fresh look at the game's primary villain, the Timekeeper, his minions, and franchise punching bag Claptrap. Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S--with a Switch 2 version coming at a later date--and the base version of the game is priced at $70. With its launch date drawing closer, Gearbox has been revealing more details on the game, and how it's building on the Borderlands foundation with a seamless world to explore, dynamic events to take part in, and an overhauled drop-rate for weapons that will make legendary-class feel special again.Another big change in Borderlands 4 is its tone, as Gearbox wants the humor in the game to be more grounded. Essentially, this sounds like Borderlands 4 won't be relying on comedy that can become very quickly dated after launch.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Last week I mentioned that I was reading Tokyo These Days, a manga about the production of a manga magazine. I have paired this, somewhat accidentally, with Shirobako, an anime about the anime production process. I'm four episodes in and there's almost no drama to it that isn't drawn directly from the difficulties of that production, to the point where the main tension of episode three hinges upon an FTP server being down. Wonderful. Sunday will be for watching a bit more of that, then, and avoiding the heat. Ever wonder if the oversaturated trailer showcases of not-E3 and demos of Steam Next Fest actually produce a return for developers? Simon Carless's always interesting newsletter GameDiscoverCo dug into the numbers to discover the top announcements of not-E3 and who won Next Fest. These events clearly work for some - in particular those with huge marketing budgets announcing the ninth mainline entry in a beloved 30-year-old series - but standing out has never been more difficult.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you care about Labubus? Nah, I just don’t get the hype. 2. What’s your favorite summer dessert? Hmm, all of them? If pressed to pick one, then ice cream. 3. Do you have plans for the Fourth of July yet? Connor will be dancing with her dance team in the town parade, so that’s our main event during the day. We’ll probably do a barbeque at home after the parade. Where we live doesn’t allow fireworks, so we may or may not go looking for a fireworks display. We’ll see how ambitious we’re feeling! 4. How do you feel about maxi dresses? If it’s in a petite size and the print isn’t too overwhelming, then I’ll rock a maxi dress, for sure. 5.

    "description": "Heya, friend! Happy late Father’s Day to ya! Hope you had a great one. Except for a brief drive out to visit the fam in the East Bay, we stayed around the house. But it was fun. Lots of high-intensity lounging, TV watching and chillaxin’… Rosie, purr usual, spent the day working on her science experiments. That reminds me… Tabs wasn’t particularly interested in science or genetics like Rosie is, but he was interested in acting as a father figure to at-risk kittens and a mentor to up-and-coming kitty supermodels. Despite his busy schedule, he always made time for the kittens in his foundation. He would read to them, do homework with them, teach them how to strut and strike poses on the catwalk — all the basic life skills. Rosie Rosie’s view of Father’s Day is a little different. As an introverted, more science-minded cat, she’s more interested in the genetic aspects of parentage.
