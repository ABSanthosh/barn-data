    "description": "Between all of the PS5 Pro upgrades we've tested to date, the Resident Evil series enjoys some of the greatest benefits by running on Sony's new hardware. In order, we have 2017's Resident Evil 7, the remakes for RE 2 and 3, Resident Evil Village, and most recently Resident Evil 4 Remake. Capcom's in-house RE Engine forms the technical backbone for all five games, of course, and each one runs as a native PS5 app. Except, there's often been a catch to their performance delivery on base PS5 - whether it's using RT features at 60fps in some cases, or enabling a 120Hz HFR mode in others, there's potential not being totally fulfilled on base hardware. PS5 Pro offers a solution across the board with its increased GPU power and more advanced PSSR upscaling, via which there's now a genuine means to bridge the gap to those frame-rate targets.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Where would you rather go on vacation: New Zealand, Alaska, Costa Rica or Switzerland? I’d love to go to all of these places, but right now Switzerland sounds pretty cool. 2. Ponytail or curls? Hmm. I like ponytails because they’re functional, but sometimes they give me a headache, so let’s go with curls. They’d have to be super loose ones, though. And kinda messy! 3. Did you ever have a job where you had to wear a uniform? Kinda. We had very specific guidelines for safety when I worked at the bakery, like close-toed shoes, no nail polish, hair tied back. 4. If you were in school, whom would you likely hang out with: the athletes, the drama crew, the band kids or the honors society?

    "description": "Seasons greetings! Hard to believe we’re in full-on Christmas season time now, isn’t it? Folks getting their tree (we did today!), putting up the Christmas lights (workin’ on it!), other decorations. I was looking back at December posts over the years, and when I came upon this one it made me smile. 🙂 Mt. Saint Tabby? That was SO Tabs. It was a quiet morning on our hill today. Nothing really exciting happened, except for some joggers running by, which made a certain someone’s tail poof up… While Tabs checked out the usual blades of grass, plants and trees, I spent some time thinking about how possessive and jealous Tabs gets now in his older age. And not just with his humans. He’s also like that with his domain outside. I may or may not have received a Post-It last week asking me to write the city about renaming our hill, “Mt. Saint Tabby,” because Tabs doesn’t like the thought of anybody, and by “anybody,” I mean any other cats, chilling on his hill.
