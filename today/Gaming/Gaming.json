    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Loose or fitted t-shirts? Generally, I like my tees slightly loose-y goose-y if I’m wearing them with jeans or shorts. If I’m layering with a sweater or a sweatshirt on top, then fitted. 2. What’s the oldest thing in your makeup bag right now? Hmm, the brushes? Oh, and I’m almost embarrassed to say this out loud, but I have an ancient Nordstrom Naturals MAC palette that I bust out every so often. 3. How’s your June going so far? It’s been very, very busy with end-of-the-year activities, dance things and whatnot. Things will kinda slow down after June 30, which I’m looking forward to. 4. How do you feel about walking around in sandals or flip flops without your toenails painted? I like my toe nails[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 882 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What time do you usually wake up in the morning? These days, 6 in the morning. Ideally my day would start off at 5:30, though. 2. How organized is your purse? It’s on the verge of haphazard, always, LOL! I mean, I can find the usual things I absolutely need – my phone, wallet, keys, medication, lipgloss. But do I find those things in an efficient manner? No. 3. If you could make one rule that everyone around you had to follow, what would it be? Make your deadlines. I can’t stand it when people are casual about due dates! 4. How do you feel about wearing makeup when it’s hot? I’ll do it, but I don’t like to do too many layers. I’m happy with cream[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 881 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Osamu Tezuka: The Ablaze Collection Box Set $53 | Releases July 8 Preorder at Amazon Manga legend Osamu Tezuka is famous for his work on Astro Boy, but the mangaka was responsible for numerous other works during his long career. Famously referred to as the \"godfather of manga,\" Tezuka also illustrated shorter series, and several of these are being reprinted as part of a deluxe box set. Osamu Tezuka: The Ablaze Collection will be released soon on July 8, but there's still time to preorder it. Osamu Tezuka: The Ablaze Collection Box Set $53 | Releases July 8 The Osamu Tezuka: The Ablaze Collection contains four volumes showcasing Tezuka's other work, such as One Hundred Tales, which follows an ordinary accountant falsely accused of a crime and ordered to commit ritual suicide, but is interrupted by the sudden appearance of a witch. The second volume, Shakespeare Manga Theater, adapts several of Shakespeare's plays into manga form with familiar characters playing key roles. The third volume, Tomorrow the Birds, tells the story of super-intelligent birds overthrowing humanity, and the fourth volume, Neo Faust, follows a professor who strikes a deal with the sorceress Mephisto to live a fulfilling life in exchange for his soul.It's worth noting that all of these stories are available as individual trade paperbacks as well, so if you don't want to wait until July, you can grab them all now--though you'll pay a bit more buying them a la cart compared to the box set.One Hundred Tales -- $12 ($15)Neo Faust -- $20Tomorrow the Birds -- $14 ($15)Shakespeare Manga Theater -- $13 ($15) Preorder at Amazon As mentioned above, Tezuka's most well-known work is Astro Boy, which follows a robotic boy with human emotions and an arsenal of super weapons who defends Earth from evil robots and powerful imperialist governments. The sci-fi manga series originally ran from 1952 to 1968, and thanks to its strong art and storytelling, it remains highly regarded by manga fans. It also served as the inspiration for many other popular manga, anime, and video game series, including Capcom's Mega Man. If you're looking to grab the original Astro Boy manga, the series is available in several paperback omnibus editions. Astro Boy Manga Omnibus EditionsAstro Boy Omnibus Vol. 1 -- $17.89 ($25)Astro Boy Omnibus Vol. 2 -- $25Astro Boy Omnibus Vol. 3 -- $29.90Astro Boy Omnibus Vol. 4 -- $17.68 ($25)Astro Boy Omnibus Vol. 5 -- $20 ($25)Astro Boy Omnibus Vol. 6 -- $23.13 ($25)Finally, you can bring Astro Boy to your desktop with this adorable new Nendoroid figure. Manufactured by Good Smile Company, this is a cute recreation of the atomic-powered hero, and it comes with swap-out face plates, rocket legs, and other accessories that can be used to make him strike a pose.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Herdling is an odd little game. How do you begin to sell the idea that a (presumably emotional) herding simulator might be quite interesting? Yes, people love their farming sims as a band aid form of escapism, but a lot of those games are in the first instance much more about farming and not farm animals, nor the way you interact with said animals.

    "description": "We don't really get to write about Playdate, that bespoke games console with a built in crank, here on RPS very much because it is very much not a computer (though former EIC Katharine did review it back when it launched). Well, not in the way we need it to be for our purposes. But I have an excuse to do so today!
