    "description": "After an official reveal at Star Wars Celebration Japan, new details on Star Wars: Zero Company have been revealed. One of the interesting things about the game is its setting, as the events of Zero Company will unfold during the Clone Wars. While the galactic civil war has been explored in detail, Zero Company will focus on the hidden stories of that conflict and the covert operations that took place. Thematically, the game draws upon Star Wars stories like the Clone Wars animated series, Rogue One, and its prequel series Andor, as well as classic World War II movies like the Dirty Dozen.\"The Clone Wars offers us a lot of the tools we need mechanically for the game, which is great,\" Bit Reactor creative director Greg Foertsch explained in an interview with GameSpot. \"But it's also interesting, we haven't seen that kind of zoom level in the Clone Wars, and so it's a pretty unique spot to land that also offered a lot of great options for us from a game design perspective, to tell a really great story with some great mechanics added to it. That really opened the door for us to do a lot of things.\"LucasFilm Games producers Orion Kellogg and Kelsey Sharpe added that the Clone Wars era allowed for \"all sorts of places in that zone\" where original stories could be told. The nuanced storytelling of the Clone Wars was a big influence on Zero Company, alongside the boots-on-the-ground atmosphere of Rogue One. Films like the Dirty Dozen also inspired the idea of how the Zero Company squad comes together, but as Sharpe noted, the first Star Wars film still stands as the guiding light for the game.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Star Wars video games have primarily focused on action for several years now, but Star Wars: Zero Company breaks from that trend by throwing players into the battlefields of a single-player tactics game. The genre remains fairly popular thanks to games like XCOM, Gears Tactics, and Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters, but there's still a perceived barrier to entry in a genre that doesn't hesitate to throw a lot of gameplay mechanics at its audience.Developer Bit Reactor is looking to avoid this issue with Zero Company, as the studio is aiming to create a Star Wars adventure that is both approachable and appealing to hardcore fans of the genre. Speaking to GameSpot, Bit Reactor creative director Greg Foertsch explained how Zero Company will organically teach players its systems as they delve deeper into the murky underbelly of the Clone Wars.\"I think that when you look at these games--in general--a lot of times the mechanics can overwhelm and you tack the story on later. By using the story to guide us, it doesn't shut down doors, it open doors. \"And it's not just about what we want people to play, but also what we want them to feel. And so through camera work, presentation, and story, I think we're able to hit a lot of notes and really make this game appeal in a different way and kind of innovate in a way that the other games in the space haven't. I think we're really focused on trying to like marry those two aspects of it, the immersion and the presentation level with the mechanics.\"Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Thus, alongside some other issues, it's had a general reception of \"yeah, it's not bad\", which in a world of sequels upon sequels isn't always the response a developer might want. Still, a sequel is still clearly on developer Rebellion's mind. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Group chats: love ‘em or leave ‘em? It depends on the group, hahaha! I mostly love ‘em, and for those chats that I wanna leave (but can’t for whatever reason), well, that’s when the mute button comes in handy. 2. Full, medium or sheer? Hmm. For things like face makeup, then medium or sheer, although to be honest medium feels like full coverage for me these days! When it comes to, like, nail polish, though? Opaque all the way. I’ve got no time for sheer nail polish these days. Oh, and does this apply to perfume, too? Because if we’re talking about scents, I’ve been more into medium and sheer scents lately. 3. Did you pick up anything during the Sephora sale? Not this time, no.

    "description": "Sure, Tabs was a great boss, brilliant thinker, a total disruptor who dominated everything he ever tried, but let’s be real… He was a really tough employer. He was so demanding! “Meow!” he’d say, or “Mrrow!” A lot of the time, his directives had to do with treats (of course), or petting — specifically, deep-tissue kitty massage. I did my best, but I was only human, which yeah, was a bit of liability. That’s why Tabs spent years developing the perfect robotic assistant. We even released a couple pretty good ones. In fact, our Tabby Dynamics subdivision was the first to bring a bipedal humanoid cat assistant to market. When Rosie took over as CFO, I thought she’d be different. She had a bit of a softer streak than Tabs, but we quickly realized that she was also pretty demanding. She isn’t as tough as Tabs was, but I think it’s fair to say that one of our pet assistants has trouble with bananas. That’s one way to describe it… She may not be the[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 857 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
