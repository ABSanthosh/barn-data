    "description": "The missions in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl take you all over the Exclusion Zone. Some of these might even have confusing steps, which can lead to headaches. One, in particular, involves your good pal, Richter. Here's our guide on where to find Richter in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. This is part of a main quest called A Minor Incident.Where to find Richter in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl - A Minor Incident main questThe Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl A Minor Incident main quest happens several hours into the campaign. We don't want to spoil all the details, but this is occurs after a couple of failed assaults on a well-guarded facility. You're tasked with learning the whereabouts of scientists to aid you in your mission. Heading back to Wild IslandSurprisingly, only Richter seems to know where the scientists are. You'll find him lounging around in Rostok Base, which is due west of Slag Heap. However, Richter won't share the details unless you obtain a certain item first.That item is a collar, which should appear marked on your map. It's in the Wild Island region (as you can see in the image above). Getting the collar from the PsydogOnce you reach the location in Wild Island, you'll notice an abandoned building. Your goal now is to take out the Psydog that appears in this area.The Psydog is a mutant with psionic capabilities, allowing it to create clones of itself. You don't want to waste high-caliber ammo on the clones, so just shoot them with a pistol or submachine gun. One bullet is enough to cause them to explode. Once enough clones have been taken out, you'll notice the real Psydog among the pack. Blast it quickly before it creates more clones to confuse you. An issue with Richter's locationLoot the Psydog for the collar. This will cause Richter to call you via radio, saying that you should \"swing by [his] location.\" Now, this is where things get a bit tricky, as we've experienced in our playthrough:We're not sure if it's a user interface (UI) bug, but the quest marker for Richter doesn't appear at all. It's not in the compass or the world map (as you can see in the image above).Moreover, Richter's comment about his coordinates implies that he might be anywhere in the Exclusion Zone. It's going to be a hassle to search for him if that's the case. Hey, Richter's hiding in the shedFunnily enough, Richter is actually inside the shed that's just west of the main building. He's basically a few meters away from where you killed the Psydog. It's a bit weird that he'd contact you via radio when he's fairly close by.As you approach the shed, Richter's quest marker should appear once you're just a few meters away from him. Hand over the collar to complete this quest step. Once you're done, you can tackle the next objective which, thankfully, appears properly on the map.That does it for our guide on where to find Richter in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. If this is a UI bug, then we hope the issue is fixed in due course to alleviate any confusion.",

    "description": "Numerous dangers await you in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. You'll have to contend with nefarious bandits and hostile factions, as well as a slew of rabid mutants and unstable anomalies. In one particular instance, you also need to fight off drowsiness that leads to death. Here's our guide on how to complete the Poppy Field quest in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl.How to complete the Poppy Field quest in Stalker 2: Heart of ChornobylThe Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl Poppy Field quest takes place in the Lesser Zone, the initial area where you begin the campaign proper. Our guide discusses the mission objectives, the eerie location itself, and the rewards that you can receive. Poppy Field location and quest startThe Poppy Field mission comes from an NPC named Mityay. You can find him the building with your personal quarters and stash in the village of Zalissya. Mityay tells you about a Religious Icon that he's left behind and the Poppy Field should appear as a point-of-interest.The Poppy Field is located northwest of Zalissya, at the border's edge of the Lesser Zone region. Before you head there, make sure you have a couple of Non-Stop Energy Drinks. You're gonna need these for what comes next. Fighting off drowsiness in the Poppy FieldWhen you approach the Poppy Field in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, your first impression might be that it's a quaint and scenic place, especially with the red flowers all in bloom. Don't let the majestic beauty of this location fool you, because walking in the fields actually causes your character to get drowsy. At first, Skif's vision will go dim, and you'll even hear voices at certain areas. At certain points, you might even get teleported to odd locations, such as rooftops.To combat drowsiness, you need to drink a Non-Stop Energy Drink. However, the effects are only temporary, and you really can't stay out in the open for long. Otherwise, your character will collapse and die, and you have to reload your last save. Meeting with PomorAt the eastern edge of the village, there's one house that's occupied. Inside, you'll find a fella named Pomor. He has the following proposition:He can tell you the exact location of the Religious Icon if you pay him 2,000 coupons.Alternatively, you can help him with a task, which involves delivering some weapons and items to him.You don't need to pick either of these, since we can just tell you the location. Religious Icon locationTo get the Religious Icon, you need to find the cellar in the Poppy Field. Here's what you need to do:From Pomor's house, cross the field until you reach the gap between the two abandoned buildings.At the gap, walk straight ahead going west.In this sea of red flowers, you should spot a hole in the ground.Climb down the ladder to reach the cellar and pick up the Religious Icon. Rewards: Should you give the Religious Icon to Pomor or to MityayNow, you have to choose who gets the Religious Icon:If you pick Pomor, he'll give you the Unknown Stalker's AR416. This assault rifle, sadly, has low durability, and the repair might cost a bit much. A notification will also tell you that you can sell the Religious Icon to Pomor, though this step seems to be bugged so you can just ignore it. The quest will be completed automatically anyway.Alternatively, you can return all the way back to Zalissya so you can give the Religious Icon to Mityay. You'll receive 1,000 coupons for your efforts.That does it for our guide on how to complete the Poppy Field quest in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. This is just one of many side quests that lead you to all sorts of odd locations in the Exclusion Zone.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Butter on your toast – yes or no? Yes please! And if it’s Kerrygold Salted Butter, then woo hoo. 2. Your two favorite seasons? Fall and spring. 3. Pick your red lipstick for the day – what’s the name? Rouge Dior 999. 4. A Thanksgiving dish you don’t like? Soggy gray green bean casserole. 5. A color that makes you happy? Yellow (hence the picture of the butter at the top, ha). Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon. 1. Butter on your toast – yes or no? 2.
