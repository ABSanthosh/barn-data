    "description": "Solasta: Crown of the Magister is a fantastic video-game translation of D\u0026D's 5E ruleset, doing so with a healthy dose of humor and charm years before Baldur's Gate 3. Now, developer Tactical Adventures is hard at work on a full sequel, Solasta 2, and PC players will be able to take it for a spin in 2025.Announced during The Game Awards 2024 and launching initially in early access on PC, Solasta 2 will see players battle an \"all-powerful being\" named Shadwyn, who is voiced by Baldur's Gate 3 narrator Amelia Tyler. The game is set on the new continent of Neokos, which creative director Mathieu Girard said is filled with \"unprecedented lore.\" If you've played Baldur's Gate 3, you should be very familiar with most of the turn-based mechanics coming to Solasta 2. It makes use of the \"full depth\" of the 5E system, according to the developer, which--much like the first game--means playing it can actually give you a very good crash course in learning D\u0026D, even though it's not set in any Wizards of the Coast universe.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Where would you rather go on vacation: New Zealand, Alaska, Costa Rica or Switzerland? I’d love to go to all of these places, but right now Switzerland sounds pretty cool. 2. Ponytail or curls? Hmm. I like ponytails because they’re functional, but sometimes they give me a headache, so let’s go with curls. They’d have to be super loose ones, though. And kinda messy! 3. Did you ever have a job where you had to wear a uniform? Kinda. We had very specific guidelines for safety when I worked at the bakery, like close-toed shoes, no nail polish, hair tied back. 4. If you were in school, whom would you likely hang out with: the athletes, the drama crew, the band kids or the honors society?

    "description": "Seasons greetings! Hard to believe we’re in full-on Christmas season time now, isn’t it? Folks getting their tree (we did today!), putting up the Christmas lights (workin’ on it!), other decorations. I was looking back at December posts over the years, and when I came upon this one it made me smile. 🙂 Mt. Saint Tabby? That was SO Tabs. It was a quiet morning on our hill today. Nothing really exciting happened, except for some joggers running by, which made a certain someone’s tail poof up… While Tabs checked out the usual blades of grass, plants and trees, I spent some time thinking about how possessive and jealous Tabs gets now in his older age. And not just with his humans. He’s also like that with his domain outside. I may or may not have received a Post-It last week asking me to write the city about renaming our hill, “Mt. Saint Tabby,” because Tabs doesn’t like the thought of anybody, and by “anybody,” I mean any other cats, chilling on his hill.
