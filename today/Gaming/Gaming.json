    "description": "A new Day Of The Devs is upon us.Summer Game Fest Live may be over, but there are still plenty of cool reveals coming throughout the weekend. Next up on the docket is Day Of The Devs: Summer Game Fest Edition 2025, with a heaping helping of indie titles coming soon.Twenty-one different games were discussed during this Day Of The Devs show, with six of them being world-premiere announcements. We've gathered every game announced at the show in one helpful gallery here, and you can rewatch the entire Day Of The Devs: Summer Game Fest Edition 2025 presentation on the official Day Of The Devs YouTube channel. Snap \u0026 GrabSnap \u0026 Grab is a neon-soaked puzzle adventure game where a crew of nimble thieves attempts to steal valuable items from unsuspecting marks. Players will take pictures, combine them to plan the heist, and then strike when no one is suspecting a thing.Snap \u0026 Grab is scheduled to launch early next year for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. Big WalkThe next game from Untitled Goose Game developer House House is Big Walk, a co-op multiplayer adventure game where players will simply walk and talk together through a world of challenging puzzles. Voice chat will react to the team's situation, which means it can be distorted when speaking through a radio or blocked out completely behind soundproof glass--and that can affect your puzzle-solving abilities.Big Walk is set for a 2026 release. Sword of the SeaSword of the Sea, developed by Abzu and The Pathless firm Giant Squid Studios, puts players in the role of the Wraith, a being risen from the dead and tasked with restoring a lost ocean. The Wraith will do this by surfing through surreal landscapes on a magical sword.Sword of the Sea launches August 19 on PlayStation 5 and PC. Escape Academy 2: Back 2 SchoolCoin Crew Games is heading back to class in Escape Academy 2: Back 2 School, which lets players explore a massive campus that doubles as a massive escape room. Meet your classmates, find escape rooms to solve, and more within the sprawling campus setting. MixtapeBeethoven \u0026 Dinosaur, the team behind The Artful Escape, is back with Mixtape, where three friends set off on an adventure on their last night together. Skateboarding, fireworks, and sneaking into an abandoned theme park are among the antics players will enjoy throughout the narrative adventure, set to a soundtrack including Devo, The Smashing Pumpkins, and Silverchair.Mixtape will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S as a day-one Game Pass addition, and PC. BlightedDrinkbox Studios, developers of Guacamelee, are back with Blighted, an isometric-action metroidvania. A new dynamic difficulty system constantly changes the player, the world, and the enemies within as the game progresses, and the entire game can be played in both solo and co-op modes.No release date was announced, but a playable demo was mentioned to be planned for later this year. Dosu Divas: One Last MealDosu Divas blends cooking minigames with turn-based RPG mechanics in this \"spicy narrative-based RPG\" from Outerloop Games. The story follows sisters Samara and Amani as they try to restore the lost traditions of their community, which were eliminated by an evil corporate fast food chain.Dosu Divas is planned for release in early 2026. PossessorsHeart Machine (Hyper Light Breaker) has teamed up with Devolver Digital for its next game, Possessors: a metroidvania-style brawl in a world torn apart by horrific monsters. Luca, the heroine, must team up with Rem, an uncooperative spirit, in order to solve the mystery and save the planet. Moonlighter 2: The Endless VaultNext up was a new look at Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, the new adventure from Digital Sun. The gameplay footage revealed combat, enemies, new ways to build up your shopkeeper hero Will throughout a run, and more. Moonlighter 2 launches later in 2025. Please Watch The ArtworkThe creator of Please Touch The Artwork and its sequel is back with Please Watch The Artwork, a \"psychological spot-the-difference game\" where paintings come alive at night, and you must watch them and report any anomalies that occur within them. Oh, and watch out for the sad clown. Marvel Cosmic InvasionDotemu and Tribute Games's next 2D beat-'em-up, Marvel Cosmic Invasion, showed more footage of the two characters announced during Summer Game Fest Live--She-Hulk and Rocket Raccoon. Marvel Cosmic Invasion is scheduled to launch later this year. NeverwayWe next got a new look at Neverway, a \"slow-burning horror RPG\" where players will farm, fish, and craft during the day, and battle ghouls and monsters at night. Neverway features pixel art from Celeste artist Pedro Medeiros and music by Fez composer Disasterpiece. RelootedRelooted, the next game from South African studio Nyamakop, places players in the role of a thief working with a group who wish to return priceless artifacts to their cultures of origin by stealing them from the museums that hold them. Scope out the museum, plan an escape route, and carry out the heist.Relooted is planned for a 2026 release. RatatanA new outlook at Ratatan, the rhythm-based spiritual successor to Patapon on the PSP, was next in the presentation. The segment confirmed new modes, more colors, and online multiplayer will be part of the game, which launches in 2025. Thick as ThievesVeteran game developer Warren Spector made an appearance in the livestream next to speak about his upcoming multiplayer stealth game Thick as Thieves. New gameplay showed the different ways players can sneak, steal, and strike in order to become a master thief before their opponents. Pocket BossPocket Boss starts out looking like a standard smartphone app, but texts will soon come in from your needy boss, who needs help with \"fixing\" charts for a report. Move lines, increase and decrease bars, and make charts however you wish in order to keep your boss happy. Consume MeDeveloper Hexecutable describes Consume Me with the following: \"BEING A TEENAGER SUCKS. So we made a videogame about it.\" As Jenny, you'll create schedules, plan meals, and navigate the final year of high school as best as you can. Consume Me launches on September 25. OffIn 2008, a Belgian developer called Unproductive Fun Time developed a small RPG called Off, which would go on to inspire massively popular hits like Undertale. Now, Off is returning to modern platforms with a new soundtrack, revamped combat, and six new bosses to challenge. Off launches August 15 on Steam and Nintendo Switch. Tire BoyWhen it comes to the hero of this next game, the name \"Tire Boy\" is self-explanatory: Players will control a \"tire boy,\" or a half-tire/half-person. Tire Boy will solve environmental puzzles, help townsfolk, and travel the world in search for clues about his past, as well as the fate of his people. Toem 2Swedish studio Something We Made presented the first look at gameplay for the follow-up to 2021 photography adventure Toem, which will make the jump from 2D to 3D. Players will once again take photos in order to solve puzzles, while also teaming with new NPCs called Friends who can enhance the camera in interesting ways. UnbeatableThe livestream ended with a performance from Peak Divide, one of the bands featured in the rhythm action game Unbeatable from D-Cell Games and Playstage. Gameplay footage was interspersed within members of the band singing Worn Out Tapes from the game's soundtrack.",

    "description": "Today during the Day Of The Devs Summer Game Fest Showcase, South African developer Nyamakop, in partnership with Mooncat Games, revealed Relooted, a heist game where a group of thieves try to return priceless artifacts to the cultures that revere them.Each mission in Relooted plays out in three phases: First, players will scope out the museum and locate the target artifact. Next, they'll enter the building and create their getaway path as quietly as possible, avoiding guards and other obstacles along the way. Finally, it's time to grab the artifact and escape using the path created in phase two.RelootedIn an interesting twist, the artifacts players will be targeting in Relooted are not fictional ones made up for the game. Instead, they are real-world artifacts that are currently sitting in Western museums, and each in-game artifact comes with a brief biography of its origin, the culture in which it originated, and why that artifact is so revered by that culture.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "In developer No Goblin's Snap \u0026 Grab, high fashion meets high stakes crime. It's the 1980s and no-one suspects that you, a famous fashion photography, also happens to be an infamous master thief - using your cover, as well as your camera, to identify high value items and anything that might help or hindering your plans when night falls and your crime spree begins. You'll gather intel, use your photos to assemble a step-by-step plan, and even try and shake-off the detective on your tail. Snap \u0026 Grab, which is being published by Annapurna Interactive, comes to Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S \"early next year\". Read more",

The bulk of your enemies are household objects - vending machines, plant pots, office printers and other fittings that have become vessels for demons. From this premise springs a note of tragedy powerful enough to conquer my outrage at a game title that has brackets in it. The demons are not, in themselves, violent - it’s inhabiting the inanimate that maddens them. “Possessing something cold and dead is agony… so they lash out,” explains Rhem, a mortally wounded devil you meet in the prologue.

Deus Ex creator Warren Spector introduced some pre-alpha footage this evening, and while I won't pretend I'm actually likely to play anything PvP anytime soon that isn't Mechabellum, I enjoyed seeing how they've adapted some of that classic immersive sim DNA Spector is known for into a competitive format.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What time do you usually wake up in the morning? These days, 6 in the morning. Ideally my day would start off at 5:30, though. 2. How organized is your purse? It’s on the verge of haphazard, always, LOL! I mean, I can find the usual things I absolutely need – my phone, wallet, keys, medication, lipgloss. But do I find those things in an efficient manner? No. 3. If you could make one rule that everyone around you had to follow, what would it be? Make your deadlines. I can’t stand it when people are casual about due dates! 4. How do you feel about wearing makeup when it’s hot? I’ll do it, but I don’t like to do too many layers. I’m happy with cream[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 881 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Tabs always said that in kitty modeling, the best defense is a good offense. If you just rest on your laurels, sooner or later a hungrier up-and-coming cat (or Australian Shepherd) will take what’s yours, and you won’t be walking the catwalk at feline fashion week anymore. Nope, if you’re lucky, you’ll get a page in the Petco catalog. Every once in a while Tabs went into kitty ninja mode, and instead of just patrolling the neighborhood, he conducted more advanced cat recon… He’d inspect the houses on the circle more closely to look for signs of canine or feline incursion. One day, he picked up a new cat’s scent around an air conditioning filter a couple houses down. He sniffed the area for a long time, gathering intelligence, and then used the data to compile a cat profile. According to Tabs, the new cat was a three-year-old male tabby with green eyes and a crooked tail… Moderate kitty modeling potential. Of course, he was added to the database. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict,[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 863 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
