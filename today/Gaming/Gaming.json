    "description": "Fighting games aren't exactly known for having the best storylines, but the Injustice series, which is set in an alternate version of the DC comics universe, is an exception. Not only has the in-game storyline spanned two games so far, but its also been adapted and expanded into its own DC comics line. While the series has seen multiple collections already, the second run, aptly titled Injustice 2, will soon be collected into a massive hardcover omnibus edition. The Injustice 2 Omnibus Edition releases May 20, and preorders are available for $125 at Amazon. Injustice 2 Omnibus Edition | Releases May 20 $125 Written by Tom Taylor--who also penned the first two years of the award-winning Injustice: Gods Among Us comic books--the Injustice 2 comics pick up shortly after the end of the first game. With the evil parallel-universe Superman of the first game locked up in a super-jail, Batman now works on rebuilding the planet after it endured five years of hell under the Man of Steel's rule. Of course, new threats reveal themselves, and Earth's heroes must once again rise up to protect its people. The omnibus includes Injustice 2 issues 1-36 and Injustice 2 Annual 1 and 2. Preorder at Amazon If you haven't read the original Injustice series yet, you can pick up an omnibus edition at a very good price through Amazon right now, as it's available for $50 (was $125). Injustice: Gods Among Us Omnibus Edition Volume One covers the first three years of the series, and it charts the fall of Superman after he's tricked by the Joker and ends up destroying Metropolis city and accidentally killing his family, sending him into a villainous rage. Batman quickly becomes the leader of a resistance group, and it's not long before all hell breaks loose between the two former friends.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "I’ve never played 2001’s Gothic, developed by Piranha Bytes, but Sin has an article from 2016 about why it is “more believable than modern RPGs”. In that piece, she paints an absorbing picture of a magically quarantined penal colony, where three factions of prisoners enjoy an uneasy truce. In this crammed ocean vent of a setting, fights generally end in defeat rather than death, reputation isn’t just a points gauge, and the player character’s centrality is an accident. It sounds pretty thrilling. I am still searching for this RPG in the Steam prologue demo for Alkimia Interactive’s Gothic reboot. There are certainly some intrigues afoot, and I’m quite enjoying the desolate quarry scenery, but I’m distracted by aspects of the presentation, not least the fact that the prologue character looks like a Funko Pop incarnation of Highlander’s Christopher Lambert.

Since Enshrouded is in early access, it has not delivered all the content that has been planned yet.  There was even a roadmap about that a bit back. So there is more […]",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which would you rather have: an epic eyeshadow collection or an epic lipstick collection? My eye makeup game has been super minimal for the past couple of years, so epic lipstick collection it is! 2. If you could only wear one type of pants for the rest of your life, which would you pick: yoga/workout leggings, jeans, chinos or overalls? Although I like the idea of wearing pants with stretch, I do not love the idea of wearing leggings that hug my butt so closely for the rest of my life. UGH. But I guess I’d go with yoga/workout leggings, simply because I can’t imagine working out in jeans or chinos. And I guess one could dress leggings up for formal occasions? 3.

    "description": "Finally! A sunny week. 🌞 This is such a great time of year in the Bay Area. It’s still a bit wintry, but we usually get a few weeks in late February that are ridiculously perfect. Sunny and crisp with highs in the upper 60s to low 70s. We’ve gotten more rain than usual (the new usual) for three years in a row, including this one, which is weird because we had a drought that lasted a decade! I know it’s temporary, but for three years the weather has been, like, retro normal. Trees are healthy again, the streams and rivers are flowing — it’s bizarre! This is the time of year one of my tabby’s favorite flowers bloomed. Tulips! He loved almost everything about them. (“Almost” because he did not like the fact that they’re toxic.) Rosie loves this time of year too. Not quite spring, but not quite the dead of winter either. During unseasonably warm weeks like this one, the grass starts growing, oak trees start blooming, squirrels are…squirreling, and butterflies and[Continue reading...] The post Select Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 852 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
