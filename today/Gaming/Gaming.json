Enhanced versions of both open-world Zelda games launch alongside the Switch 2. If you're looking forward to playing these two masterful games in 4K at 60fps with HDR, you should check out Amazon's deals on the official hardcover strategy guides. Whether you've played the games already or plan on experiencing them for the first time, these well-designed books are handy reference manuals and beautiful collectibles.With the looming resurgence of both games, it's possible that these two hardcover strategy guides could either sell out or increase in price again. As of April 28, though, you can get Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's Collector's Edition Guide for only $25 (was $45) and Zelda: Breath of the Wild's Expanded Edition Guide for just $22 (was $40). Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Collector's Edition Guide (Hardcover) $25 (was $45) The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's Collector's Edition Official Guide is a weighty 496-page hardcover with display-worthy cover art featuring the Corrupt Master Sword.Published by Piggyback and created in collaboration with Nintendo, Tears of the Kingdom's guidebook covers virtually every aspect of the sprawling open-world sequel. Along with an overview and tips for all of the main quests, side missions, shrines, and caves, the book offers comprehensive reference sections for all of the game's enemies, weapons, armor, shields, items, and more.All of the game's key systems, from crafting and cooking to using Zonai devices to build vehicles and other gadgets, are detailed alongside helpful tips and overarching strategies.The included World Atlas map section provides the locations all of the Koroks, Dragon's Tears, and collectibles scattered across mainland Hyrule as well as the Sky and Depths. See at Amazon Zelda: Breath of the Wild Complete Guide - Expanded Edition $22.26 (was $40) The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's Expanded Edition Guide looks great when displayed next to the TOTK hardcover. It also happens to be every bit as comprehensive as Tears of the Kingdom's strategy guide.Piggyback published this updated hardcover edition roughly a year after the game's original launch. The Expanded Edition adds chapters on Breath of the Wild's pair of DLC expansions. In addition to walkthroughs for the DLC, the 512-page hardcover features a concept art gallery showcasing in-progress illustrations and sketches by Nintendo's designers.The guide offers an overview of all main missions and side content, including every shrine. You'll also find solutions to all of the game's many puzzles and an in-depth look at the combat system. Catalogs of enemies, gear, and items let you use this book as a reference manual. The 36-page World Atlas reveals locations of collectibles, including every Korok seed. The book also includes a double-sided map of Hyrule with annotations. See at Amazon Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Guide (Paperback) $18.74 (was $30) Circling back to Tears of the Kingdom, it's worth noting that the paperback edition of the official TOTK guidebook is available for $18.74 (was $30). If you think you'll use the guidebook frequently for reference or want a display piece, the more durable hardcover Collector's Edition is the way to go.Breath of the Wild's paperback edition guidebook is out of print, likely because it launched alongside the game in 2017, so it doesn't include coverage of the Expansion Pass. See at Amazon If you already own Tears of the Kingdom and/or Breath of the Wild for Switch, you will be able to purchase $10 Switch 2 upgrades for each game from the eShop. But if you're a new player or simply want to own physical editions for Nintendo's new platform, check out our preorder guide for the Switch 2 versions of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.

    "title": "Best Oblivion Remastered Mods To Download So Far",
    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-oblivion-remastered-mods/2900-6502/",
    "description": "Mods were a core part of the experience for PC players with the original Oblivion, adding thousands of community-made updates, fixes, and full-blown expansions. In Oblivion Remastered, mods are not officially supported by Bethesda, so there's no creation kit for players on consoles to download mods. However, mods for the remaster are still fully available and actively being developed by the community. While the modding scene for Oblivion Remastered only features a few hundred mods at the time of writing, that won't be the case for too long. Modders will continue to work on new mods and even attempt to port over mods that were made for the original Oblivion. For the time being, though, we have come up with a list of the best mods you can download for Oblivion Remastered right now. These mods are in no particular order, and we've tried to cover a wide range of areas with our selections. You can see a full walkthrough of how to download mods in Oblivion Remastered in our previous guide. Ultimate Engine TweaksCreated by: VP40L0If you're plugged into the Bethesda RPG modding scene at all, you knew this one was coming. The Ultimate Engine Tweaks mod is always one of the most popular and useful mods for any Bethesda game, and the same is true in Oblivion Remastered. This mod tweaks the game engine to remove a large majority of stutters, improve latency, and increase overall performance. All of this is accomplished without any downgrade to visual fidelity. Carry Weight ModifierCreated by: ErokNext up is another classic RPG mod. The Carry Weight Modifier mod allows you to drastically reduce the weight of the items currently in your inventory. The way this mod works in Oblivion Remastered is that it makes your lockpicks weigh -150 pounds. According to the mod creator, this is done due to how the engine is set up. So, in order to make use of this mod, you'll need to always ensure you have at least one lockpick in your inventory. The more lockpicks you have, the more weight you can carry. No Item DegradationCreated by: ErokFollowing the Carry Weight Modifier mod is another quality-of-life mod called No Item Degradation. This mod does exactly what it says it does; it makes it so that all of your weapons and armor don't degrade the more you use them. This essentially cuts out the need for blacksmiths and repair hammers in Oblivion Remastered, giving you one less thing to worry about when you're traveling across Cyrodiil. This doesn't apply to enchantment degradation, though, so you'll still need some Soul Gems to recharge your enchanted weapons. Difficulty Slider FixedCreated by: IxionXVIIIf you've tried to play Oblivion Remastered at some of the higher difficulty levels, you may have noticed that combat is extremely unforgiving. Enemies hit way harder than you expect them to and your damage barely seems to affect them, regardless of what weapon you're using. With the Difficulty Slider Fixed mod, you can take out the strict difficulty levels and instead use a slider system. This allows you to customize the damage taken and damage dealt multipliers to be more in line with what you expect. Now, the Master difficulty level feels much more forgiving compared to how it works by default. Weightless Alchemy and Misc. ItemsCreated by: ExalderanThis mod falls in line with the Carry Weight Modifier mod, but it offers a different experience. If you don't want to worry about your carry weight entirely but still don't want useful items clogging up your capacity, then the Weightless Alchemy and Misc. Items mod is what you want. This mod brings the carrying weight of several items down to zero. The items include arrows, alchemy items, potions, books, soul gems, and other miscellaneous loot you might pick up. Your weapons and armor still weigh their normal amount, but you no longer have to stress about picking up too many arrows or brewing too many potions. Richer VendorsCreated by: ErokIf you've ever gone to a merchant in Oblivion Remastered with a ton of valuable loot to sell but the vendor didn't have enough gold to cover the sale, then the Richer Vendors mod is one you should download. This mod gives all merchants across Cyrodiil the ability to hold 10x their normal gold amount. This means all merchants will have at least 1,000 gold to spend on all of the loot you want to offer them. Horse Whistle - Summon and FollowCreated by: PushTheWinButtonBuying a horse is a rite of passage in Oblivion Remastered. They're certainly not the cheapest thing you can purchase in Cyrodiil, but having one makes your life much easier. Unfortunately, the game doesn't offer a traditional way to summon your horse or issue it any commands. Fortunately, the Horse Whistle mod implements just that, giving you the ability to whistle for your horse. When you use the power, your horse will either teleport to you if it's farther away or slowly walk over to you. You can also make the horse follow you by using the power in conjunction with the waiting mechanic. The Horse Whistle mod only works when you're outside of a city's gates. Less Restrictive Spells and Utility SpellsCreated by: Oblivion6871If you're playing as a mage or simply want to use magicka from time to time in Oblivion Remastered, you'll immediately notice there are quite a few restrictions on spellcasting. The Less Restrictive Spells and Utility Spells mod aims to rectify that, allowing all magic effects to be made available when casting a spell or enchanting an item. You need to have the spell effect learned already, though. The mod also allows you to spellcast and enchant anywhere you want and increases the summon limit to 10, giving you the ability to unleash a horde of minions on enemies. Finally, the mod adds a few utility spells to the game as well, such as True Invisibility, Master Key, and more. Oblivion Remastered High Quality MusicCreated by: DEEJMASTER 333While the music in Oblivion Remastered is extremely well done, it can always be improved. The Oblivion Remastered High Quality Music mod replaces the current audio files in the remaster with HD MP3s from the official soundtrack, making the music sound much crisper and clearer. The audio files in use are of the \"highest quality\" according to the mod creator, and nearly all of the music in the game is replaced with the HD versions. If you're simply looking for a way to increase the game's fidelity, this mod is a great starting point. Classic Oblivion Color GradingCreated by: WickedzzThe team behind Oblivion Remastered did an absolutely phenomenal job of updating the game's graphics to look much clearer and more modern. However, if you're still in love with the old, more vibrant color palette of the original Oblivion, you can download the Classic Oblivion Color Grading mod. This replaces all of the new landscapes, which are slightly duller in color, with the landscapes of old that feature a much brighter palette. The mod certainly brings back waves of nostalgia as you're traveling through the various roads of Cyrodiil and seeing all of the classic yellow and green colors from the original game.",

    "description": "“Pilgrimage” is a side quest in The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered that requires you to look for nine shrines across the map to pray at. Praying at these shrines will help determine if you’re worthy of becoming a knight. While this quest doesn’t have any rewards, it opens up several other future ones, including […]",

If you have at least 30 GB of storage, 12 GB of RAM, a processor or graphics card from approximately this decade, and some willing or easily subjugated friends to serve as co-op partners, then you too will be able to savour the experience of getting your arse chewed off by a three-faced wolf made of swords and fireballs.

Woot's MSI event sale, alongside Woot's Spring gaming sale, feels like it was designed for anyone who wants real gaming hardware without paying real gaming hardware prices. Factory reconditioned means everything's tested, backed, and a lot cheaper than pretending brand new is always better. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What sports would you have liked to have played as a kid? I would’ve loved to have taken dance classes. I think I would’ve enjoyed soccer, too. 2. Would you rather listen to the radio or replay a favorite album? Replay a favorite album. Speaking of that, my family will probably freak out if I play the greatest hits from Fleetwood Mac one more time. 3. Have you ever had a job where you had to be on your feet all day? Yup. I’ve done retail and worked in the back of the house in a bakery. Gotta have supportive shoes! 4. Do you have any travel plans for the summer? Right now we’ve got one camping trip to the Russian River planned, and that’s it.

    "description": "Things are a little different now under Rosie’s feline leadership — less kitty modeling, fewer lavish parties, and we don’t fly business class anymore. Lot more science, though. 😂 So, on the one paw, we’re on the cusp of developing a new fusion-powered AI robot that can dispense crunchies, but on the other paw, daily life can be a little…boring. But that’s OK! We like boring now. Here’s a quick look back at a typical spring day when Tabs was in charge. He made everything seem exciting, even just going for our morning walk. Tabs was hongry today on our walk. Not just hungry, but hongry. He was ravenous! He didn’t even care about the giant turkeys gobbling on the hill or the little kids shouting at the neighborhood playground. He was too busy hunting for the freshest, tastiest shoots of grass, which were hard to find today because the condo landscapers mowed the hill this week. Tabby loves Novato so much, and we’re coming up on the best time of year for kitty exploring.[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 859 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
