They're noisy, so you'll know their location easily, although we've found that they spawn most often in dark caves and under trees in dense forests. They're also pretty big, so hitting them is easy, and taking them down isn't strenuous at all.While killing spiders is the easiest way to get your hands on plenty of string, there are other methods. You can also break cobwebs, fish, and loot it from jungle temples, desert pyramids, and dungeons. If you have some tamed cats around your base, it might also bring you some string as a gift from time to time. Although we've heard that cats only bring \"gifts\" when they think you're incapable of looking after yourself--so take from that what you will.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So‚Ä¶what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn‚Äôt, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It‚Äôs just a list of more or less random questions I‚Äôve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What made you smile today? It‚Äôs early in the day (I just woke up 30 minutes ago), but so far petting Marnie and Rosie, and re-reading the homemade Mother‚Äôs Day card Connor made are two things that made me smile. 2. What‚Äôs the first thing you do when you get home and walk through the door? Hmmm, well, I want to say that I usually take off my shoes first thing because, hello, I need foot freedom (shoes are so oppressive), but I think what I technically do is lock the door behind me. 3. What‚Äôs your favorite cereal? Does oatmeal count? If it doesn‚Äôt then, it‚Äôs Kellogg‚Äôs Special K with the dried red strawberries. I don‚Äôt really eat it for breakfast, though. It‚Äôs more of a[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 878 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "It‚Äôs almost dusk here at Casa de MBB, and we‚Äôre getting cleaned up and ready for bed, but I still wanted to wish you a Happy Mother‚Äôs Day. There‚Äôs so much to say about Mother‚Äôs Day, isn‚Äôt there? It can be an emotional day in many ways for many reasons, different for everyone. People have such different relationships with their parents and their children and all of the creatures they care for, and life is fleeting. We all lose our care givers and loved ones someday, and days like today mean different things to all of us at different times in our lives. I pray and hope your day was good to you. Every Mother‚Äôs Day, just like every other day, I also think about Tabs. Oh! ‚Äî sometimes when I see an old picture like this one below, I tear up, especially on Mother‚Äôs Day. I sure miss my special boy!
