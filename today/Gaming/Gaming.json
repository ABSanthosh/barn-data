    "description": "Hello reader who is also a reader, and welcome back to Booked For The Week - our regular Sunday chat with a selection of cool industry folks about books! Did you know that adopting language altered the position of the human larynx, making us more susceptible to choking on food? I learned this because I've finished Blood Meridian, and was reading McCarthy's musings on the evolution of language as a chaser. Proof, then, that the only truly fitting way to leave this world is to die choking on a book. Perhaps this week's guest can recommend a good one? Read more",

    "description": "The next Phasmophobia update, Chronicle, is due out next month with a newly revealed June 24th release date, and developer Kinetic Games have offered up some details on what it calls one of the game's \"biggest updates\" so far. So, let's have a look at what that entails! The key addition with this update is the arrival of sound evidence, which as you can probably guess is a new haunting paranormal proof type that you'll acquire by using the newly added sound recorder.

    "description": "You‚Äôre probably gonna laugh with how haphazard I am with makeup these days, but it‚Äôs the best I can do with the time I have, so here it is: I use a twist-up, long wearing gel pencil (MAC Colour Excess) and draw a messy line on my upper lash line with no concern about the precision at all, LOL! If it‚Äôs too thick, then I smudge it out. If it‚Äôs too thin, then I figure the makeup goddesses wanted it to look that way, so I go with it. I don‚Äôt even bother trying to line my waterline, either. I usually layer eyeshadow on top of it anyway, so I‚Äôm not overly concerned. Seriously, THAT‚ÄôS IT! How about you? How do are you doing your liner these days?

    "description": "So‚Ä¶what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn‚Äôt, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It‚Äôs just a list of more or less random questions I‚Äôve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. When was the last time you spent a good amount of time outside? Yesterday morning. Connor had a sleepover with a friend the night before, and the girls wanted to play outside, so we all hung out in the circle. The girls played and did art projects; I walked Marnie and threw her ball for her about a billion times, LOL! 2. Do you sleep on your back, your tummy or your side? Usually my back. If my sinuses are stuffed up (hello allergy season), then it‚Äôs my side. 3. What‚Äôs something beautiful about today? Well, I get to spend it with the people I love the most ‚Äì Connor, El Hub, Marnie and Rosie. 4. What‚Äôs one pair of shoes you wear a lot?
