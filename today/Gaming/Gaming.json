    "description": "One of the best feelings in a roguelike is when the pieces all come together to create a perfect run. In Hades it's a powerful combination of powers, in Dead Cells it's a perfect set of weapons, and in Balatro it's all about getting the right combination of Jokers. With the right set of Jokers, a run in Balatro can feel almost easy at times. You have so many Joker effects happening that the game starts to speed up the animations and your score catches on fire because you aren't about to just win the round--you are about to blow past it, making the score you need to reach seem trivial in the process.These runs are amazing in Balatro and in other roguelikes, but that's because it's not how every run goes. In fact, that's how very few runs usually go. Most runs in Balatro, including many of my winning runs, have me barely beating out each round with my final hand. Every shop or bonus for skipping a blind becomes deeply important, because I need another boost in chips or multiplier; otherwise my run is about to crash and burn. This scrappiness is what makes Balatro special, and there are multiple mechanics that let you take some of the chance out of these runs, making it just as viable to fight tooth and nail to win a run as it is to break the game entirely with your build.Balatro lets you control your fate (mostly)Balatro's iconic Jokers can drastically change how each hand plays out.While it's not uncommon for roguelikes to allow you to influence the powers or weapons you might receive in a run, Balatro consistently provides you the opportunity to make risk-versus-reward assessments. Each ante has three blinds, two of which can be completely skipped. You won't earn any money or get to visit the shop, but you will get something else. Sometimes it's as simple as a pack of cards to add to your deck, or it can guarantee a Joker of a certain rarity or with a specific bonus type. Importantly, the reward is never a specific Joker--only certain modifiers or rarities. There is never any point where you can guarantee yourself the exact Joker you need, which puts an emphasis on working with whatever Jokers you do get.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Happy New Year, friend! I sincerely believe 2025 will bring us so many wonderful things, including good health, joy and adventure! Connor and I spent the last day of 2024 soaking up art at the SF Museum of Modern Art, aka the SF MOMA and one of my favorite places in the world, with some of our favorite people. It was so nurturing for my soul to be surrounded by beautiful art and kind friends. ‘Twas the purr-fect way to wrap up the year. We were there primarily to see the Amy Sherald exhibit; you might know her from her famous painting of First Lady Michelle Obama. My favorite painting from the exhibit is this one of a young woman and her bike on a summer day. It’s called “A Midsummer Afternoon Dream.” This one called “Innocent You, Innocent Me,” is Connor’s favorite. I discovered a couple new-to-me artists to get excited about, like Yayoi Kusama, who does lots of colorful work, especially with polka dots. There was a room that she made with crazy[Continue reading...] The post SF MOMA on the Last Day of 2024 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What do you need to do the most: rest, get organized or connect with others? All of the above! Right now, the thing I need most is to get organized, though. Since October, I’ve felt like I’ve been pulled along by external forces, and I don’t want to feel like that anymore. I want to feel like I’m in charge of where my life is going, you know? 2. Who would you rather hang out with: Santa Claus, Snoop Dog, the aliens (let’s assume they’re friendly) or Cupid? Santa Claus, of course! He’s my homeboy. Together we make magic happen. 3. Which would you rather do: visit a haunted house, fly a plane, sing in front of an audience or try rock climbing on actual rocks?

    "description": "It's rare that a game released in the last gasp of December manages to not just make a lasting impression on almost a dozen-odd members of staff, but a big enough one to almost instantly supplant the last dozen months' worth of equally excellent video games they've all been playing. But that's precisely what Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has done to the Eurogamer team over these last few weeks, stealing in with hushed footsteps to lift this year's most coveted prize before any of us really knew it was happening.
