    "description": "Fortnite OG mode is taking another step toward the present very soon--Season 3 starts on March 25, taking us back to the season that kicked off way back in February of 2018. While Fortnite OG has waned in popularity a bit recently, one of the big reasons for that is that Fortnite changed very little during those original two seasons, so this nostalgic mode didn't get to do much differently either. Season 3, however, is where things began ramping up. The game's overall storyline made its very first appearance when a large meteor appeared over the island midway through the season.With just days remaining before the next round of Fortnite's throwback party begins, let's take a look at everything we know about Fortnite OG Season 3.Table of Contents [hide]Fortnite OG Season 3 teaserFortnite OG Season 3 teaserEpic has dropped a single teaser for OG Season 3, which shows an astronaut helmet with the Fortnite island visible in the reflection--along with the meteor above it. The TikTok and Instagram versions of the teaser are the most illuminating versions, as they reveal that the astronaut is wearing a studded leather jacket. There aren't any skins that wore anything like that from Season 3, battle pass or otherwise, but our Metallica-themed remix of Rust from Chapter 5 Season 3 did. Regardless, I doubt that thing is spaceworthy, but Fortnite isn't concerned with such things.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The new Nintendo Switch exclusive just launched on March 20, but the Amazon-owned discount shop has made a habit of offering $10 discounts on Nintendo games during launch week. This deal has already sold out once, so you'll need to be quick to snag a copy for the reduced price.It's important to note that if you order a Switch game from Woot, you'll often receive an imported copy. All Nintendo Switch games are region-free, so the only difference you'll notice is the ratings board logo. Your copy of Xenoblade Chronicles X will be sealed and fully playable in English, so as long as you don't mind a slightly different box, you might as well save 10 bucks while you can.Woot has a bunch of Nintendo Switch game deals right now, including a number of other recent Nintendo exclusives.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Who can say what made Ubisoft change their minds on Steam Deck support for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, the pretty good samurai stealther that previously stated an intention to go without. Perhaps a high-ranking executive, visiting family to invite them to a trip on his spare yacht, had his frozen heart melted by the sight of a Naoe-cosplaying granddaughter clutching a Steam Deck OLED in her clearly-too-small-for-it hands. Perhaps. It works, is the main thing. And works well – remarkably well, actually, considering not just the previous denial and 11th hour U-turn, but the game’s high PC system requirements and at least partially mandatory ray tracing. This does come at the cost of a severely stripped-down quality settings menu, and you’ll still need to sign into a Ubisoft Connect account even if you own Shadows on Steam, but there’s no doubt that its Steam Deck Verified status is deserved.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What eye makeup products have been on repeat with you lately? Maybelline Lash Sensational Sky High Mascara (eh, it’s just OK), Stila Liquid Liner Micro Tip (it’s pretty good) and good ol’ Anastasia Brow Pencil. 2. How good are you about finding clothes that fit you well? I used to be OK at it, but now, I don’t really enjoy in-person shopping as much as I used to, so I don’t spend the time that one really needs to find the things that fit great. There’s always something a little off with my clothes and I just kinda live with it. Blergh! On the bright side, at least my outfit is always ironed and somewhat matching. 3. How good are you about resisting impulse purchases? Pretty good![Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 871 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Tabs was a natural born optimist. He always saw the up side to everything, sought out the silver linings and took advantage of every opportunity to spread hope and joy. That might be why he liked holidays so much — because they were an opportunity to play Santa “Claws,” so to speak, and spread good tidings to everyone. Perhaps for the obvious reasons, St. Patrick’s Day was a fave. Obviously, with those gorgeous green eyes, he loved the color scheme. ☘️ And then, of course, the gold… He was also a big fan of that. 😊 Rosie has her own reasons for celebrating St. Paddy’s Day. For starter’s, alchemy… In fact, she did her PhD dissertation in turning lead into gold through targeted meows in the ultra-low frequency range, the so-called “smoker’s meow” spectrum. Marnie, however, did not get the memo regarding St. Patrick’s Day this year. Or rather, she did get the memo, but she didn’t read it. Or, well, she read it… She just didn’t understand it at all. 😹 Your friendly neighborhood[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 854 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
