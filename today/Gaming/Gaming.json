    "description": "The third Sonic the Hedgehog movie premieres in theaters on December 20. The movie will expand the live-action Sonic universe by introducing the Blue Blur's fan-favorite rival, Shadow the Hedgehog. Keanu Reeves is voicing this new incarnation of Shadow, while Ben Schwartz and Jim Carrey return as Sonic and Dr. Eggman, respectively.While fans have to wait a few more weeks to see Sonic, Shadow, and Dr. Eggman finally clash on the big screen, you can make the wait for Sonic the Hedgehog 3 a little easier by catching up on the many other Sonic movies and TV series that are available on Blu-ray.To help you track them down, we've rounded up all the Sonic movies and TV series Blu-rays into this buying guide. You'll find links to the previous Sonic movies, the Knuckles series, and the numerous Sonic TV shows check out. That includes classic 90s series like The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic Underground, as well as newer shows like the Sonic X anime series or Sonic Prime. We've also thrown in a selection of Sonic comic collections and video games to round things out, including the most recent entry in the series, Sonic X Shadow Generations. Sonic the HedgehogSeveral years after it was first released, it's still amazing to think how close the world came to an Ugly Sonic movie. Fortunately, a months-long delay led to a welcome redesign of the Blue Blur, and the film was also a treat for anyone who watched it. A regular Blu-ray can be yours for $10, but if you're looking to splurge, the $33 4K version includes some great extras, like a snazzy steelbook case, a mini-comic, and several poster cards.Sonic the Hedgehog - Bonus Stage Steelbook Edition (4K) -- $33Sonic the Hedgehog -- $10 Sonic the Hedgehog 2The first Sonic sequel brought fan-favorite characters like Tails and Knuckles into the fold and made the Chaos Emeralds a central part of the plot. The result is a fast-paced adventure with a ton of charm that feels authentically Sonic. You can pick up the movie in a special steelbook edition by itself or in a two-movie collection that includes the first live-action film.Sonic the Hedgehog 2-Movie 4K Blu-ray Steelbook Collection -- $25 ($48)Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Steelbook Edition (4K) -- $26 KnucklesKnuckles was the breakout star of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, thanks in no small part to Idris Elba's voice performance, so it was only a matter of time before the Echidna warrior got his own starring role. The Knuckles TV series saw the brawler go on a journey of self-discovery, mentor a protege in his warrior ways, and tangle with new villains. The series is available on Blu-ray as either a special steelbook edition or a standard Blu-ray release.Knuckles Blu-ray Steelbook Edition -- $29 ($32)Knuckles Blu-ray -- $21 ($26) The Adventures of Sonic the HedgehogEasily the wackiest Sonic cartoon series, this '90s classic saw the speedster and Tails regularly clash with Dr. Robotnik and his robot henchmen Scratch, Grounder, and Coconuts. This box set includes all 65 episodes from the series, as well as several shorts, commentary on select episodes, and retro TV spots.Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog Complete TV Series -- $37 ($60) Sonic the Hedgehog (90s animated)Released the same year as The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, the Sonic The Hedgehog animated series was a surprisingly darker take on the story than Adventures, starring Sonic as a freedom fighter working to overthrow Dr. Robotnik's regime on the planet Mobius. All 26 episodes are in this DVD box set.Sonic the Hedgehog - The Complete Series (DVD) -- $12 ($20) Sonic UndergroundIn Sonic Underground, the speedster discovers that he has two siblings from whom he was separated at birth. And yes, all three of them were voiced by Jaleel White, who played the infamous Steve Urkel on Family Matters. Similar to the 1993 Sonic animated series, the show once again sees Sonic meet up with resistance groups in an effort to overthrow Dr. Robotnik and end his reign of terror, but this series was a bit more light-hearted in comparison.Sonic Underground: The Complete Series (DVD) -- $15 ($25) Sonic BoomThis CG-animated series is great for younger members of the family. The Sonic Boom series focused on Sonic, Tails, Amy, Knuckles, and Sticks as they teamed up to protect their home village on Seaside Island from attacks by Dr. Eggman and his robot minions. Currently, only season two is available on Blu-ray, but you can pick up the rest of the series on DVD. few editions available that throw in some collectible toys.Sonic Boom Season 2 -- $18 ($35)Sonic Boom Season 1, Volume 1 Gift Set with Figures (DVD) -- $12 ($25)Sonic Boom Season 1, Volume 2 Gift Set with Figures (DVD) -- $25Sonic Boom Super Pack (6 DVDs) -- $14 ($25) Sonic XWhile most Sonic animated series were western productions, Sonic X was an anime series featuring the Sega mascot and his pals. Accidentally teleported from their home planet to Earth, the gang would make new allies as they clashed with Dr. Eggman and his robotic forces over control of the powerful Chaos Emeralds. This box set has all 78 episodes, dubbed into English.Sonic X Complete English Dubbed Series -- $52 ($70) Sonic Prime - Seasons 1 \u0026 2After Sonic accidentally triggers an explosion during a fight with Dr. Eggman, he finds the gates to the multiverse open in this new series that originally aired on Netflix. The first two seasons consisted of 16 episodes that saw Sonic take part in a reality-bending adventure, where he encountered alternative versions of familiar friends and foes. A third and final season was also produced and available to stream on Netflix but isn't on Blu-ray yet.Sonic Prime Season 1 -- $13 ($20)Sonic Prime Season 2 -- $12 ($20) Sonic the Hedgehog Comics \u0026 BooksIf you're still hungry for more Sonic stories, you can also branch out into the Sonic comic book universe.Sonic's no stranger to comic books--shoutout to all the Archie Comics fans out there--but the Sonic stories published by IDW have been consistently entertaining. Beautifully illustrated and packing a narrative punch, these are easy to dive into thanks to the various IDW Collections out there.We've also included the Encyclo-Speedia on this list, a mus-have for Sonic historians looking to explore the games over several decades. The hardcover deluxe edition is especially nice, as it includes a sharp mosaic cover, a sturdy slipcase, and a folio housing two archival gallery prints of Sonic and Dr. Eggman.Sonic the Hedgehog IDW Box Set (Vol. 1-3) -- $36Sonic the Hedgehog: The IDW Collection 1 (Vol. 1-3) -- $33 ($60)Sonic the Hedgehog: The IDW Collection 2 (Vol. 4-5) -- $35 ($60)Sonic The Hedgehog: The IDW Collection 3 (Vol. 6-8) -- $33 ($60)Sonic the Hedgehog: The IDW Collection 4 (Vol. 9-10) -- $27 ($60)Sonic the Hedgehog: The IDW Comic Art Collection -- $13 ($20)Sonic the Hedgehog Encyclo-Speedia (Standard edition) -- $31.34 ($50)Sonic the Hedgehog Encyclo-Speedia (Deluxe edition) -- $80Sonic The Hedgehog 30th Anniversary Celebration: The Deluxe Edition -- $14 ($20) Sonic the Hedgehog gamesOf course, there's also the many new Sonic the Hedgehog games to enjoy while waiting for the new movie. Modern Sonic games typically fall into one of two camps, with one group focusing on recreating the retro golden years of the franchise and the other attempting to tread new ground with ambitious 3D adventures.For fans of looking for a more classic experience, Sonic Origins Plus and Sonic Mania are likely your best bet, while those interested in something new should give Sonic Frontiers a try, which takes the series in a new open-world direction. There's also the recently released Sonic X Shadow Generations, which includes two playable campaigns. One is a remaster of the original Sonic Generations campaign and the other is an all-new storyline starring Shadow the Hedgehog that run parallel to the events of Generations.Sonic Origins Plus -- $25 ($40)Sonic Mania -- $20Sonic Frontiers -- $20 ($40)Sonic X Shadow Generations -- $50Sonic Forces -- $20",

New this year is Arcane Embrace, a one-of-a-kind shotgun with a new archetype that fires two slugs with each pull of the trigger instead of one. Especially with its god roll perks, it's an extremely powerful option for leveling tough enemies or dealing boss damage.Arcane Embrace is only available during the Festival of the Lost and only from specific sources. Here's how to get it and the god rolls you'll want to chase.Table of Contents [hide]How To Get Arcane EmbraceHow To Get Arcane EmbraceYou can only get Arcane Embrace by completing the Haunted Sectors activity as part of the Festival of the Lost or from event vendor Eva Levante in the Tower. The good news is that you're guaranteed to get an Arcane Embrace just by completing the quick set of quests Eva gives you at the start of the Festival of the Lost to get acclimated to the event--and it's kind of a great one with Trench Barrel and Dual Loader, which you can only get as this reward from Eva. After that, you can play Haunted Sectors for a chance to get Arcane Embrace rolls as rewards.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It consists of messages from an oily elder demon to his nephew about how to correctly groom the soul of an unsuspecting human being. It's a claustrophobic send-up of managerial politics and nepotism, with World War 1 unfolding in the background. A real pick-me-up. Sintopia is the Two Point incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last Halloween costume you wore? Hmm, a couple years ago I was a panda! It was a low-effort panda though. LOL! 2. Best and worst Halloween candy? I used to love Snickers, but now I find them too sweet, so please give me all the Ghrirardelli Caramel Squares. As for the worst ones, I automatically toss the rolls of Smarties and anything licorice related. Blech! 3. Pick your Halloween nail color – orange or black? Black with a high shine top coat please. 4. Vampires or werewolves? I’d rather hang out with the werewolves. 5. Scariest Halloween movie? “The Shining” still freaks me out! Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon.[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 854 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "No one threw a Halloween shindig like Tabs — fancy cat costumes, spooky snacks, special appearances from top-tier talent, including Tabs. In fact, Heidi Klum stole the idea for her spooky soirees from him. Here’s a look back at a typical Halloween 🎃 and all the prep Tabs usually did. My Darlings, There’s an old saying in the plus-size kitty modeling world: “Go big or go home,” and I take that phrase to heart when it comes to hosting parties. I want my guests to be talking about them for years to come. Being a famous feline supermodel, I’ve hosted many Halloween shindigs in my time, and I have almost a decade of party-planning experience. In that vein, here are the four essential components of a successful feline Halloween party. 1. Invitations First things first — the invitations. In the digital age, e-vites and group invites via Facebook are acceptable; however, I’m a little old fashioned. I prefer paper invitations. Do what I do, and ask your assistant to design you a custom invite.
