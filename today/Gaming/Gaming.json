    "description": "Beating the Ender Dragon in Minecraft technically marks the end of the game, as the credits will roll when you leave the area post-fight. However, there are several useful techniques and important mechanics that you need to know before you head into the fight with one of the strongest Minecraft mobs. Here's how to find the Ender Dragon, how to beat it, and the rewards you'll get for slaying it.Table of Contents [hide]Items to bring to the fightItems to bring to the fightBefore we get into the mechanics of the Ender Dragon fight, there are several items you should seek out and bring with you on the journey. You'll want to read our dedicated Minecraft The End guide for information on how to find The End and how to get there, but in terms of items that will be useful, we've got you covered.You'll need three full stacks of scaffolding in order to reach the tops of the towers. You can bring normal blocks, but scaffolding allows you to go up and down at will, instead of relying on water buckets to break your fall from the top of the tower. If you're anything like me, you've failed at the water bucket trick too many times to count, so scaffolding is the safer option. Having said that, do bring a water bucket to protect yourself from the many Endermen that spawn in the fight arena.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It‚Äôs just a list of more or less random questions I‚Äôve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What did you have for breakfast? Protein smoothie with whey protein powder, greek yogurt, unsweetened almond milk and fruit (apples and strawberries). It‚Äôs easy, doesn‚Äôt require turning on the stove and it keeps me full for hours. 2. How did you do your hair today? I‚Äôm wearing it down, with soft, barely there waves. Kinda boring but it‚Äôs practical for me because it takes about five minutes to style. Plus wearing it down helps with the migraines (I get bad ones). 3. What‚Äôs your favorite summer month? June. It‚Äôs the end of the school year, and you feel like the whole summer is ahead of you! It‚Äôs also warm but not too hot yet. Oh, and it‚Äôs my birthday month, too.

Today, a special meeting of the Board of Directors of Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC was called to review a most disturbing matter ‚Äî the repeated and inexplicable disappearance of Chief Feline Officer Rosie‚Äôs crunchies. At various times over the past few weeks, Rosie‚Äôs food bowl, which had been previously full, has become empty, and as you can imagine, this caused quite a corporate kerfuffle. The results of an internal investigation were inconclusive, but Rosie thinks she knows who‚Äôs doing it‚Ä¶ Since the official investigation was inconclusive, the board hasn‚Äôt taken any action, but Rosie‚Äôs suspicions have created a lot of tension‚Ä¶ Unfortunately for Marnie, she has a lengthy record of snack theft, so her history isn‚Äôt doing her any favors. Plus, she was captured on security footage early this morning in the vicinity of Rosie‚Äôs food bowl. When asked about it by the company investigator, Marnie lawyered up‚Ä¶ I just hope this gets resolved soon because it‚Äôs been bad for morale in the office. üôÇ Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 861 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

I have a hard enough time keeping up with one life in the amateurishly designed role-playing game we call reality, with its saddening shortage of rideable dragons. Ah, but of course developers Level-5 are merely being cute with their framing. By \"lives\" they really mean classes or character jobs. In this blend of open world boglin basher and island town-builder, you will switch lives like you're, well, exactly like you're putting on different coats and hats, going by the trailer. Those 14 lives are split between three self-explanatory categories: under Gathering Lives we find farming and fishing, while Crafting Lives include blacksmithing, alchemy and such, and Combat Lives are all about ending them.
