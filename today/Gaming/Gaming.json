    "description": "Cast your mind back a year or so ago, and you might remember Helldivers 2 being in a bit of a funny old place. On the one hand, it was a huge critical and commercial success; on the other, it was being review bombed into oblivion thanks to Sony's mandatory PSN nonsense. Eventually, all that hoo-ha died down, but not before developer Arrowhead suggested it might commemorate the whole affair with a review-bomb-inspired cape.

In fact, she insists on waking me up at the crack of dawn so that she can go running with me, and by running I mean sprinting circles around me as I shuffle along… I believe she thinks that I am her sheep. 🐑 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Select Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 865 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you care about Labubus? Nah, I just don’t get the hype. 2. What’s your favorite summer dessert? Hmm, all of them? If pressed to pick one, then ice cream. 3. Do you have plans for the Fourth of July yet? Connor will be dancing with her dance team in the town parade, so that’s our main event during the day. We’ll probably do a barbeque at home after the parade. Where we live doesn’t allow fireworks, so we may or may not go looking for a fireworks display. We’ll see how ambitious we’re feeling! 4. How do you feel about maxi dresses? If it’s in a petite size and the print isn’t too overwhelming, then I’ll rock a maxi dress, for sure. 5.
