    "description": "Candy Crush is getting another feather in its cap. Rather than offering another twist on match-three puzzling, Candy Crush Solitaire will bring the franchise's sickly sweet aesthetic to the card game classic. It will be the first Candy Crush game to release after Microsoft's acquisition of developer King.Candy Crush Solitaire bases itself on tripeaks solitaire, in which players must clear three \"peaks\" of cards. The game will feature familiar power-ups from Candy Crush, including jelly fish, the lollipop hammer, the color bomb, and the UFO. They will offer similar, but not exactly the same, powers as their match-three counterparts. Much like other Candy Crush games, the basic solitaire gameplay will be altered and made more challenging as players progress. Candy Crush Solitaire will launch worldwide on February 6. Players can pre-register now on the app store of their choice and they'll receive some in-game rewards: 5,000 Coins, four undos, two fish cards, and three color bomb cards.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Welcome back to The Sunday Papers. It's 2025, which means that this column has been running for eighteen years. What might change here as we move into adulthood? Very little, I suspect. We here are like the chalk cliffs of the South Downs: bright and imposing and subject to inevitable but slow erosion by the sea. Or put another way: I'm thinking about bringing back the bulletpoints to separate different links. How are you? Felipe Pepe wrote about the gentrification of video game history, arguing that American video game history overwrites more local experiences. \"We’re not all suburban kids who got a Nintendo 64 for Christmas.\" Read more",

    "description": "Hey friend, it’s been a crazy week. We’ve spent a good chunk of this week keeping up with friends and family who live in the LA area, and although the people we know were braced for evacuation, they never had to do it, thank goodness. So yeah, crazy times. I don’t know if I ever talked about it here, but a few years back the police came banging on our door and told us we had 30 minutes to grab our things and leave because there was a growing fire on the hill behind our house. The fire department was able to put it out quickly, thank goodness, but a part of me will never forget frantically running around the house looking for Rosie (she did NOT want to go into her cat carrier) and stuffing Connor’s uniforms into a bag just in case she needed them for school the next day. I also vividly remember calling my neighbors, who weren’t home at the time, and asking them if they wanted us to get their[Continue reading...] The post Saturday Thoughts appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. If you could eat one food all day long, what would it be? Popcorn! If left to my own devices, I could easily have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 2. Who in your life is most like you? To be honest, probably my dog, Marnie. 3. Your current favorite store? Ooh, girl. You know you’ve crossed a bridge when you no longer want to hang out at Sephora or Nordstrom anymore. LOL! These days I’m all about Williams Sonoma (the fancy kitchen store)! Who wants to come with me to gawk at gadgets, dutch ovens and tableware? 4. What’s one thing you need to do today? Vacuum, although honestly I don’t know why I keep trying to keep the floors clean. Between the pets, friends and[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 863 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
