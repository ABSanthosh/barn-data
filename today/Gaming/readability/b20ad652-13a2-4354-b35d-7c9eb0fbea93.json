  "text": "Game reveals, demos and more Image credit: IGN RPS's corporate daddy has announced that IGN Live is returning this June. The in-person event aims to fill the void left by E3, with playable demos in LA and livestreams of game reveals and panels for those who can't attend. Now in its second year, IGN Live features games but also announcements about films, television and comic books, with those who pick up tickets able to expect \"exclusive reveals, celebrity panels, game demos, photo ops, exclusive merch, gaming stations, screenings, lounges, live episodes of IGN shows\" and more, according to the announcement. The event takes place at Magic Box \u0026 The Reef in Downtown LA, and those interested in tickets can sign up to be notified when they go on sale. Last year's IGN Live featured news and announcements from Microsoft, Ubisoft, Razer and Nvidia, among others. RPS has yet to get involved with IGN Live, but we're no strangers to making a mess of events held by our corporate dads. Remember when we turned EGX Rezzed into a tabletop game, permamently transformed the TF2 voice cast into a comedy troupe with RPS@PAX, and had Nate share the true history of Jason Statham in videogames across several continents? IGN, let us on your stage.",
