  "text": "This one's pretty critical, though Image credit: Ubisoft Another month, another Assassin's Creed Shadows update, again one that comes with a list of quality of life changes, but also one that comes with another surprising collaboration. Let's start with that one, which is, weirdly, a new story pack made in collaboration with Critical Role, the wildly popular actual play series. For some context, Critical Role did an official Assassin's Creed themed oneshot a little while back. In said oneshot, Hi-Fi Rush's Robbie Daymond played a character called Rufino, who's being added into the game through this new mission in update 1.0.6. \"Rufino, an old friend of Tomiko and Heiji, calls in a life debt after uncovering a deadly conspiracy,\" Ubisoft explains. \"While working as a translator, he discovered evidence that a secretive organization has been hiring assassins to eliminate influential commoners. Now, he turns to Naoe and Yasuke for help in stopping these killers.\" Completing this quest nets you Rufino as a new ally, and you'll get the Critical Role logo as a banner. Right, now the regular update stuff. A new nightmare difficult setting is now available with this update, which does a few different things. Defensive options are less effective in this mode, and you need to pull off perfect parries for them to deflect the hit fully. Enemy AI is \"smarter, faster, and more aggressive in a variety of circumstances, including detection.\" And combat resources are harder to find too. For those of you oddly desperate to wear your headgear during cutscenes, that'll be an option now too, and there's toggles for specific types of VFX that you can turn off and on as well. The regional alert system available in castles has been expanded to the whole province on top of that, meaning that when you repeatedly attack \"Civilians or Military units outside Castles, the alarm can be triggered, and a group of Guardians will hunt you in the world.\" There's also three different camera presets when on a horse, for your riding pleasure. Lastly, for us here in PC land, there's an Ultra Low visual quality level - you can read about the exact specs that's catered to over on the post about the update, alongside the list of fixes and tweaks that you mostly don't need to worry about.",
