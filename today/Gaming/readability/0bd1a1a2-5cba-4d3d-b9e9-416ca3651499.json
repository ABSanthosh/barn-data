Unlock the 90’s Outfit by completing the #DressToImprezza Photo Challenge on the first week of the Festival Playlist. Festival Playlist The Festival Playlist from Back to the 90’s really is all that. Get jiggy with a collection of four cars designed to represent 90s automotive design to the fullest. Two out of the four cars coming in this update are thought to be majorly customized coming with different parts to add into your creations and make them your own. 1997 Toyota Soarer 2.5 GT-T Earn 20 PTS during Week 1 “Summer” Season on the Back to the 90’s Festival Playlist. Available from October 10 until October 17. 90s extravagance car-sonified, the 1997 Toyota Soarer was the Japanese brand’s most tech advanced addition to their catalogue during that decade, being equipped with an EMV touchscreen and one of the first to use an integrated GPS. Luxury and tech ooze from this car, but is it lacking muscle? AS IF! The Soarer is fitted with a 1JZ-GTE engine, meaning it has a straight 6, 2.5-liter heart beating underneath its hood producing 278 bhp and 279 lb-ft of torque driven to all four wheels. Experience what sports luxury looked and felt like in the 90s: totally fast, and totally customizable. The Soarer comes with the Origin Lab front bumper, rear bumper, side skirts and Forza front bumper and rear wing to create your ideal version! 1998 Mitsubishi FTO GP Version R Earn 20 PTS during Week 2 “Autumn” Season on the Back to the 90’s Festival Playlist. Available from October 17 until October 24. The 1998 Mitsubishi FTO GP Version R is a revised and improved version of the regular FTO: fitted with new bumpers, side skirts, and rear wing to improve aerodynamics and an upgraded suspension, differential and thicker antiroll bars to improve handling. If that combination is not to your liking, you have a selection of Forza and Bozz Speed body parts to customize it to your preference. To get this car moving, it was equipped with a 2-liter V6 engine, (one of the smallest V6s produced at the time). This car can reach 0-100 kph in just over 6 seconds and finish a quarter mile in 15 seconds. As with plenty of things in the 90s, this car’s aesthetics are complemented by stickers. Enjoy showing off the Version R decals by unlocking this car! 1990 Aston Martin Lagonda Earn 20 PTS during Week 3 “Winter” Season on the Back to the 90s Festival Playlist. Available from October 24 until October 31. Aston Martin’s second attempt at designing a four-door saloon came in with the 1990 Aston Martin Lagonda, a car with an interior so fly to add to your collection. Inside this car, you’ll find premium leather and advanced electronic instruments all over. In fact, this car was one of the first ones to include a digital panel. The outside of this car received a redesign for the 1990 edition, having more rounded corners while keeping the boxy look. Put the Lagonda’s 5.3-liter V8 engine and drive as the fresh prince of the Horizon Festival, unlocking it for 20 PTS on the Winter Season. 1996 Subaru SVX Earn 20 PTS during Week 4 “Spring” Season on the Back to the 90’s Festival Playlist. Available from October 31 until November 7. The decade that saw the birth of extreme sports needed a car to match its radical attitude. Hence, the 1996 Subaru SVX was born, because what is more extreme than a car with a roof inspired by airplanes? The SVX featured a 3.3-liter engine that produced 231 horsepower and 228 lb-ft of torque delivered straight to every wheel thanks to its AWD system. An almost stock version of this car took over the Alcan Winter Rally in 1991, driving all the way from Seattle to the Arctic Circle and back. That’s not even the most impressive fact about this Subaru! The SVX’s aerodynamics are so excellent that the car’s drag coefficient is 0.29, which is very close to that of hyper cars of the era. What’s Next Next month we’ll see new reward cars added to the Festival Playlist as well as new clothing items, collectibles, and EventLab props for your characters on Horizon Track Day!",

Hence, the 1996 Subaru SVX was born, because what is more extreme than a car with a roof inspired by airplanes? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe SVX featured a 3.3-liter engine that produced 231 horsepower and 228 lb-ft of torque delivered straight to every wheel thanks to its AWD system. An almost stock version of this car took over the Alcan Winter Rally in 1991, driving all the way from Seattle to the Arctic Circle and back. That’s not even the most impressive fact about this Subaru! The SVX’s aerodynamics are so excellent that the car’s drag coefficient is 0.29, which is very close to that of hyper cars of the era. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat’s Next\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext month we’ll see new reward cars added to the Festival Playlist as well as new clothing items, collectibles, and EventLab props for your characters on Horizon Track Day! \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
