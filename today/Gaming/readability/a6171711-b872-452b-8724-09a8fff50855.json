As it turned out, she did get kidnapped by orcs and did throw the flowers away, but threw them away one by one as the orcs hauled her off, leading to the inevitable “go rescue Meregyth” quest.  Success in that had me end up in Beaconwatch, another encampment down on the Rohan Bayou.  That pretty much wrapped things up in the Eastfold for me. From there I headed back to Edoras to see if Eowyn was ready to get her circus on the road.  But, as it turns out, there are a number of quests you need to do to get her into action.  She’ll stand there in front Meduseld with a fiery gold ring over her head, but things won’t move forward until she is ready. Eowyn stands watch until the conditions are right There is both a series of quests that you cannot complete once the move to Dunharrow commences, as well as the need to advance at least the epic quest line past a certain point before Eowyn will set herself in motion.  The former were the most obvious, so I ran around town solving problems, collecting stray items, investigating the whereabouts of Grima, and heading over to Underharrow, where the woman in charge there, Ellen Fremedon, was getting a bit impatient with Eowyn herself. Spill the tea girl, tell me all After that I decided to push on the epic quest line, which sends you out to Stoke, which is out in the Broadacres. Now entering Stoke For some reason I seem to be arriving in all these places at night.  Again, the day/night cycle oppresses me.  But I went to the mead hall and spoke to the thane and his wife.  They have built theirs up at the top of the hill, and I am started to wonder if there is some set of regulations governing mead halls. The mead hall of Stoke The art team has made sure to lay them out slightly differently.  The fire pits and tables can have different layouts, and sometimes the thane has a table and sometimes he’s just up there on a stage.  I guess they break out the TV trays when meals come around.  But despite that they all feel very familiar in design, from their peaked roofs and double doors the fire hazards of the cooking pits. And, also in line with expectations, I had to go out and help clean up the place, collecting loose lumber and helping repair the defenses. That is not a barricade, that is a cheval de frise! I swear, they have 50 words for “horse poop” but anything you can stick in the road is just a barricade with these horse lords. Finishing up there the epic quest line sent me over the line into the Stonedeans, where I ran into Nona and Horn yet again where we went around and I somehow did the local quest chain out of order as I found a guy hiding in the basement, then later on got the quest to go find that guy in the basement.  Eventually we ended up talking to the local representative of the shrunken women’s league, who at least didn’t need a big walking stick. Nona towering over her There we got our palms read and Horn insulted everybody and eventually I wrapped that up and was sent off to the Westfold and ended up at the gate of Helm’s Dike, with Helm’s Deep just beyond and I realized that maybe I had gone too far. Hey Gimli! Hold that thought, I’ll be back in a bit! I stoned… hearthed… what do we call the default recall thingy in LOTRO?  I’ve got so many travel points I get things mixed up.  Anyway, I popped back to Edoras where I had to pass by Eowyn standing outside Meduseld to go find Eowyn inside of Meduseld because I am pretty sure I had something out of order again. Also, just for reference, this was just the sort of thing I feared might happen with LOTRO when I was first thinking about it back in 2006.  The problems of converting a linear story into a game where you can go back and forth… nay, are required to go back and forth… and run into different incarnations of the same characters. Anyway, it is quite a place.  It follows the Rohan state conventions for mead hall construction, but on a grand scale, putting all others to shame. No mere mead hall this! I mean, granted, it has all the same fixtures… just a lot more of them.  Before we could go I had to go admire the tapestries and clean up the left over dishes and go find Eowyn’s room (end of the hall as you face it, small door to the left) and run all over. Some nice custom wall art… mind the mess in the corner… Finally I went back outside to Eowyn again and started an instanced quest of her being moody and resentful at having to stay behind.  Then she started asking me about my “friends” by which she meant the fellowship, and specifically that tall drink of water named Aragorn. Yeah, that one is not for you.  You get the moody but more in touch with his feelings Faramir.  He’ll do you some good. Then we had to go do some mounted combat and slay a troll to cheer her up. Fine, I’ll do some mounted combat if it will move things along here… Then she got stuck in the river, pinned down by four mounted orcs and I had to pull them off one by one before we could finish off the troll.  Given how much of the heavy lifting I had to do, maybe she was best left behind this time. All of which got her spirits restored and we were set to go to Dunharrow and I was expecting something epic… at least a cut scene.  But no, in another transaction akin to the “scene missing” moment in the Bicycle Tour episode of Monty Python, I hit the “travel now” button and there we were. At last, that took like 3 seconds? At last you got off her backside you mean! Then, that bit done, she suddenly has a yen to go see what is down the road… even though she knows what is down there.  She was playing the Eowyn Exposition role. Like you haven’t been here before… And yes, down the road and around the bend and a few dead orcs later we found ourselves as the Dark Door that leads to the Paths of the Dead. That certainly is a dark door… That established, we turned around and Eowyn took up her position at the main tent in the tent city that is Dunharrow. Eowyn the stern, Mistress of Dunharrow Seriously though, I expected them to have at least some sort of buildings or infrastructure setup here.  There were a couple of farmers digging latrines around the back.  Better that than face the Uruk Hai I guess. Meanwhile, I was closing in on level 93.  I had the quest to go to Helm’s Dike to start hanging out with Gimli, Legolas, and Aragorn.  I also had the quest to go through the Dark Door, which I recalled was exactly the place where my level 95 curse of the Valar boosted captain got his ass handed to him. I figured the Dark Door could wait.  Time to head towards my rendezvous with cut scenes at Helm’s Deep.",
