  "text": "As little as £65 / $60 for a full-size mech board Events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, while devastating on the emotional wellbeing of hardware editors, are as useful for knocking a few more quid off already-cheap bits of gaming gear as they are for saving hundreds on big-ticket luxuries. It’s the re-bargainating aspect we must concern ourselves with here, as the Logitech G413 SE – already a premier choice of affordable mechanical gaming keyboard – is now more attainable still, dropping to £65 / $56. UK deal: US deals: Considering how easily top-spec mechanicals can push £200, it doesn’t take much explaining to make clear that this is one seriously cheap keyboard. Especially since it’s a full-sizer, with substantial, good-quality keycaps, and a subtle but fine tactile bump to each press.If you’d prefer a few more toys on the side – RGB, dedicated media keys and the like – then it’s worth spending more. Otherwise, these are outstanding prices for a peripheral that understands the pure, tangible pleasures of switching from membrane to mechanical switches, and isn’t interested in gatekeeping them behind a prestige outlay.",
