There's just something way too relaxing about just letting your mind wander as you slowly try to put a cool picture together. I've also found it's way cheaper to buy puzzles than LEGO sets, so this is the direction my adult life has gone.Because of my proclivity for puzzling, I'm always on the lookout for good deals on jigsaw puzzles. While I usually try to stick to the more trusted puzzle brands, sometimes there is just a really good deal on an awesome image I can't pass up. Amazon is having one such sale right now in the form of stacked coupons.The puzzles in this sale are from Blueforest, which isn't a brand I'm familiar with. However, they seem to have some really cool options on sale right now. There is also a 10% off coupon you can clip on each individual puzzle as well as various tiers of additional discounts you can receive if you buy more than just one. Here are some of the coolest 1,000-piece options I could find where both of these coupons applied.1,000 Piece Puzzles on Sale at AmazonI did a little bit of digging into Blueforest storefront on Amazon and they seem like a reputable enough brand. Digging into the comments revealed that most customers were satisfied with the overall quality and design of the puzzles, which is mostly what you're looking for. So all-in-all, the puzzles that are in the sale seem safe enough to recommend.The sale itself is where it starts to get a bit confusing. There are multiple coupons you'll need to select to take advantage of all of the savings. First there's a 10% off coupon on each of these products that you'll need to click to receive an additional 10% on just that item. After that you can get a 6% discount for buying three, a 7% discount for buying four, and an additional 10% discount for buying five Blueforest puzzles all at once.To maximize your savings you'll need to make sure you've clipped both coupons before adding all of these products to your cart. You should only have to apply each coupon once for it to go into effect for all of them. This is overall a great deal you can take advantage of ahead of Prime Day.General Tips for Buying 1,000-Piece PuzzlesBuying a 1,000-piece puzzle is a commitment. It's one that you can easily just put on a shelf and forget about, but actually starting and finishing it takes time. Unless you are a world champion puzzler, it's going to take you more than one day to put one together. If you're new to puzzling or are just looking for a few tips for buying a puzzle with 1,000 pieces or more, we've got you covered.Make sure you have enough spaceThe first thing you should consider before buying a puzzle is whether or not you have a place to put it together. Given the amount of pieces, it can be hard to keep track of all of them at any given time. You'll need ample space to both sort through and organize pieces and be able to leave or store it and come back to it later. If you don't already have a table that is ideal for puzzling, there are quite a few puzzle boards and tables you can buy to remedy that. There are also jigsaw puzzle mats to roll up your puzzle and put it away without undoing all of your progress.Make sure you actually like the imagePerhaps the more obvious tip for buying a large puzzle is to make sure you actually like the image you're putting together before you make a purchase. A lot of puzzles feature a ton of tiny intricate details to keep you interested as you put it together, but some feature large swaths of single colors that could get tedious to put together. If you're already investing a bunch of your time into finishing a 1,000-piece puzzle, pick something that you'll be happy to see finished.Invest in some puzzle glueWhile most people put together puzzles just for the enjoyment of it all, it can also be fun to display the finished product once you're done. This is especially true if the puzzle is depicting a work of art, rather than just a photograph. It is, after all, a cardboard poster that you've put together yourself. If you plan on displaying your puzzle after you finish, you'll want to get yourself some puzzle glue to ensure the finished product actually stays together when you frame it.Originally posted: Jun 24, 2025 11:34 pm",
