The latter is particularly interesting given it should now be easier to claim rewards, such as exclusive skins and 27 new weapons, including 24 Elemental weapons and three Elemental pistols. There's also been some changes to the HUD, too, to make it easier to track your progress. Dying Light 2 Review Chat - Spoiler-Free! - IS DYING LIGHT 2 GAMEPLAY WORTH YOUR TIME? Dying Light 2 Review Chat - Spoiler-Free! - IS DYING LIGHT 2 GAMEPLAY WORTH YOUR TIME?Watch on YouTube Techland also revealed there's now \"enhanced co-op gameplay with fixed enemy behaviour synchronisation issues\" which reduces teleporting and lag, and whilst console players have to wait a little bit longer, PC players can now customise textures for Villedor thanks to new mod tools. \"In the Spring Update, you'll experience a slew of enhancements designed to elevate your co-op experience,\" the team explained. \"We have addressed and resolved various enemy behaviour issues affected by synchronisation between players. This intends to ensure smoother gameplay and reduced discrepancies, including the amount of enemies teleporting and lagging. \"The HUD has also received substantial improvements, providing clearer visual cues and streamlined access to vital information, ultimately enhancing situational awareness with multiple players on screen.\" For the full list of fixes, head on over to the official website. Dying Light 1 released on 26th January, 2015, and proved to be a massive hit for Techland, selling over 20m copies as of 2022. A sequel followed in 2022, and an 18-hour standalone adventure, Dying Light: The Beast, is set to arrive this summer. Earlier this year, Techland teased plans for \"multiple unannounced projects\" set in the Dying Light universe - including new video games, board games, and a webcomic - as the zombie series celebrates its tenth birthday.",
