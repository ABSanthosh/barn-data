  "text": "Hitting cinemas in April. Image credit: Warner Bros. Minecraft's live-action movie adaptation is almost upon us, and with its 4th April release date looming, Warner Bros. has shared a \"final\" trailer - giving us a quick glimpse of Jack Black's Nether region, as well as Jennifer Coolidge in a still-mysterious role. For this fourth and final trailer, the bombastic action of earlier showings is cranked even higher, as huge armies of classic Minecraft mobs - including Piglin Brutes and Iron Golems - amass for some sort climactic set-piece battle. That's balanced out by some sillier moments, but none of this is likely to win over anyone who's previously been put off by the ugliness of it all. We get even more of those nightmare villagers, as well as Ghasts that looked like they've just slipped in from some eldritch dimension. I'm still not convinced by the Creepers either, given what I'd always assumed were a sort of sentient cactus have been reimagined as angry shoeboxes covered in astroturf. Thank goodness for Jennifer Coolidge, then, who immediately improves the situation at the end of the trailer, simply by being Jennifer Coolidge. A Minecraft Movie | Final Trailer A Minecraft Movie final trailer.Watch on YouTube The Minecraft movie, if you haven't been keeping up, follows four \"misfits\" - played by Sebastian Hansen, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, and Jason Momoa - who're suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into a \"bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination\". To get back home, they'll need to embark on a magical quest with help from Jack Black's Steve. I can't honestly say the Minecraft movie is something I'll personally be rushing out to watch based on everything Warner Bros. has shown so far, but it does at least look like the kind of harmlessly amusing fluff that - between its silly gags and mild peril - should shut the kids up for an hour or two. And if that suits, it's coming to cinemas on 4th April. In other Minecraft news, Netflix's animated Minecraft series is getting closer to release, and there's some real-world Minecraft on the way too, as Alton Towers owner Merlin Entertainments readies to open a number of Minecraft attractions in the UK and US.",
