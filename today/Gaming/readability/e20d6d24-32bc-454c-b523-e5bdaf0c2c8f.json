  "text": "Wrapping up in Evendim means, for me, wrapping up the zones of Middle-earth which which I am well acquainted. Breeland, the Lone Lands, Evendim, and even the North Downs, those are places I have spent quite a bit of time.  As noted in my character inventory post, I have a bunch of characters that I left off playing somewhere in the level 27-42 range, which is solidly in the Lone Lands to Evendim zone. Part of the problem is that many of these zones, certainly Evendim and the Lone Lands, ramp up in levels in such a way as to make you go to elsewhere for a bit.  At least that was the design.  With an easier level curve, the landscape difficulty xp boost, and Derudh’s Stone in my pocket, I was able to muscle through the Lone Lands and Evendim, each without a diversion elsewhere. With Annuminas in Evendim done, which put me past level 40, I was now a bit on the high side of the levels needed for the Trollshaws, which was the next destination in the epic quest line. Previously Elrond sent me off to meet up with his sons, Elladan and Elrohir, so I picked back up with them, blowing a mithril coin to get to the stable master at their camp. The sons of Elrond out camping They gave me the update for book four, which I then spent a good chunk of time trying to find.  I figured I could knock off a bunch of side quests along the way, but aside from these two, there was an absolute drought of quests in their camp… which was not as I remembered it. But then I got out in the woods and almost every single mob had a little quest ring over their head.  The question was, how to get the quest.  You cannot, for example, just talk to a deer, and killing the deer didn’t seem to drop a quest starter item or anything.  So I ended up with a dead deer on the side of the road with a quest ring over its corpse. Somebody has failed in this quest As with the dearth of quests being handed out, I figured I had not done some starter quest earlier in the zone that somehow unlocked these, so spent some time back at the last bridge trying to get that sorted to no effect. What I later figured out was that slaying these mobs put up a quest in a notification section in your UI, but not the same one that deeds and what not use.  The problem, for me, was that the notification in question had been nagging me about the Spring Festival constantly, to the point that I just mentally ignored it after a while, so completely failed to notice that it changed state. Way up in the right corner of my screen… This was… again… not as I remembered how things used to work.  But my memory is faulty, and it looks like this was the case back during my trip there in 2018.  But I also didn’t get any of those quests on that run either. What did change was the map, because I ended up in a section of the zone called The Angle.  That was definitely new. This map has been redone since I was last here Back in 2018 the map of the Trollshaws looked like this. No coffee mug ring on this map The Angle looked to be a higher level area and I was out of my depth there.  It also opened up the zone and gave me more places to be lost. In the end, I got a bit fed up trying to find the location for book four and decided to give it a miss for the moment.  Instead I headed to the far side of Rivendell and into the Misty Mountains. There too I found similar change to how quests were doled out, with some mobs with quest rings over their heads.  There was certainly no pile of quests waiting for me at the first stable master. Into the Misty Mountains In addition to the mobs, the front half of the zone seemed setup to hand you quests when you hit a specific geographical marker, somewhat like the Annuminas quest plan, only without an NPC to hang around with you. So I ran through that and got to the back half of the zone where things seemed to go back to the usual “some NPC will hand you a quest” of the old days, though I wasn’t sure some of the NPCs were quite up to the task. Should I just come back when you’re feeling better? Up to this point I had been sort of trying to follow a 1-50 guide that had been posted in the forums, even if I did see to stray from its path fairly often.  I believe it assumes no xp boosts.  But I was down with the idea of passing on any quest that sent you to Goblin Town.  No need to go through that maze another time.  But I did all the quests in Vindhural and Hrimbarg, avoiding the golins, and then decided it was time to go to Angmar. That meant back to Rivendell then to Esteldin, but by this point my hunter had unlocked the travel skills to those locations… skills which have no cool down… so getting there was easy.  Running back and forth across Rivendell… well, they actually put in a stable master so you can ride now… was more annoying.  It was back on the epic quest line again, having bailed on book four and missed book five, so I was picking back up with book six. From Esteldin you ride out the east side and then north into Angmar. Let us ride to Angmar! Angmar isn’t a favorite zone of mine, though I think that applies to most everything after Evendim.  It has some problems, which start with the map. I rode in to the first camp, picked up a pile of quests… because that hasn’t changed… and opened up the map to see where I needed to go, only to be reminded that the first two camps and most of the related quest areas are covered by the quest guide UI.  You can either see the southwestern corner of the map or you can see the list of quests, but you can’t see those quests plotted on the map. And I know, I know, read the quest text.  But the NPCs in Angmar have been there for a long time and their guidance is often along the lines of, “Go past where the old Sizzler used to be, through the Valley of Arglebargle IV, and past the lake where my father and I skipped stones when I was 12 to find a lifeless watcher.”  And then, on the map, a bit of color sticks out from underneath the quest guide that covers a huge area with several dozen lively watchers that will kill you dead… erm, defeat you… before you know what is happening.  The lifeless variety, of which there are two, were dumped in a pond on the very edge of the marked area and are behind a huge rock, because screw you quest boy! Get a life! See, behind a rock! Still, I was there to get things done.  I made my way through book six and opened up book seven.  You have to do most of book six to even unlock access to the stable masters on the eastern half of the zone. Angmar, however, has a pretty wide level gap between east and west, so while I was running aqua blue and green quests early on, when I hit the other side of the zone they quickly went yellow and orange and there were a couple where I was clearly in over my head, so I decided to give Angmar a rest for a bit.  I had a couple of quests asking me to take a side trip to the vast wasteland of Forochel.  I could make up a level or two there.",

time and their guidance is often along the lines of, “Go past where the old Sizzler used to be, through the Valley of Arglebargle IV, and past the lake where my father and I skipped stones when I was 12 to find a lifeless watcher.”  And then, on the map, a bit of color sticks out from underneath the quest guide that covers a huge area with several dozen lively watchers that will kill you dead… erm, defeat you… before you know what is happening.  The lifeless variety, of which there are two, were dumped in a pond on the very edge of the marked area and are behind a huge rock, because screw

through book six and opened up book seven.  You have to do most of book six to even unlock access to the stable masters on the eastern half of the zone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngmar, however, has a pretty wide level gap between east and west, so while I was running aqua blue and green quests early on, when I hit the other side of the zone they quickly went yellow and orange and there were

a level or two there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
