  "text": "Telegraphist 1920: Beats of War puts you in a highly intense rhythm game where you are sending morse code messages in a war. This rhythm-based game is built around serious subject matter. In it, you play as a telegraphist who maintains the crucial bond between the soldiers and commanders, using morse code to communicate. Everyone is depending on you and there is no going back on the message you are writing, so you’ll need to stay on the ball and act quickly. Taking place in the aftermath of World War 1 during the Polish-Soviet war, you play a key role in making sure that messages get out to who they need to without messing them up. The game feels chaotic, intense, and powerful. As the beat plays, full of power and heavy music notes, you need to create morse code messages and change the dial on your radio so that you are always able to communicate. Pushing buttons at the right time and lining up your pen as you move to the next page is key, but once you start, the flow of the game will guide you. Telegraphist 1920: Beats of War has a strong audio-driven narration where you can hear the intensity of the words being said – the struggle in their voices. The game has 20 levels within the campaign which follow real parts of the war. You can also create your own campaign in the level editor on Steam Workshop, allowing for endless play. It’s the type of game that can be liked by both history lovers and those who liked games like Papers, Please – games that happen in a world not quite present in our own. I got the chance to play a demo of Telegraphist 1920: Beats of War at Pocket Gamer Connects London, where I really enjoyed how the entire thing fit together and felt as I played. Telegraphist 1920: Beats of War is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can grab a demo from Steam or add it to your Steam Wishlist.
