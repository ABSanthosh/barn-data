  "text": "Mastering a game is always a challenge, and when you have to deal with over 500 different ships with unique commanders, guns, and armor schemes, things can get out of hand real quickly. That’s where our new feature comes in: The Codex. Available on both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, this all-encompassing in-game encyclopedia brings everything you need to know about World of Warships: Legends right to your fingertips. The Codex is your one-stop resource for everything a new player needs to know about our game. Think of the Codex as your personal encyclopedia, filled with important information that will prepare you for the high-stakes combat of the seven seas. No more need for piecing together fragmented advice from forums and other sources. Now, all the essentials are just a few button presses away, neatly organized, searchable, and designed to make your sailing smooth, or as smooth as it can be during naval combat. When designing the Codex, we kept in mind that it needs to be easy to use. It’s filled with all the right keywords, icons, and colors to make navigation a breeze. Plus, we’ve added some visual flair to keep the reading experience exciting. With well-chosen fonts and beautiful artwork, diving into ship stats or game mechanics isn’t just informative-it’s fun. And the Codex isn’t just for new players. We decided to go a bit overboard (pun intended). Working closely with our community and experienced players, we’ve included more advanced tactics, commander setups, and ship builds for those looking to min-max. Want to know which is the ideal commander for your favorite ship class? Look no further than the Codex. Players have grinded the game for thousands of hours trying out different setups, and we’ve compiled their findings into easy-to-understand articles. The Codex offers player-tested strategies to make you the MVP of the battle. We are also making sure that the content is always fresh so you are never stuck with outdated information. But wait, there’s more! Not only does the Codex teach you about specific commanders and ship types, but it also dives into the game’s mechanics. Naval combat and the physics behind it can get quite complicated, and figuring it out in the heat of battle is almost never a good idea. That’s where the Codex shines. We’ve simplified complicated concepts such as ricochets, shell mechanics, and angling in our articles to give you an edge in battle. For example, ever wondered how to make the most out of the biggest battleship of World War 2 Yamato and her iconic guns? The Codex will explain how you can target the enemy for maximum damage output. But we won’t stop there. One of the great things about the Codex is that it’s going to be updated continuously as the game grows. New ships, commanders and mechanics are constantly being worked on by our team here in Wargaming. Making sure this tool stays relevant for the years to come is a priority. Whether you’re a new player who is just getting started, or an experienced captain checking out something new or looking back at some details, there will always be something to discover through the Codex. So, what are you waiting for? The Codex is ready and waiting to turn you from a fledging sailor into a studied academic! Take the plunge and dive deep into the world of naval warfare, and let the Codex be your teacher and guide. The ocean is a dangerous place, and you need to be prepared, especially when it’s full of Battleships, Cruisers, Destroyers, and formidable Aircraft Carriers! Think you can handle them? Download the game to join our vast fleet of players today and turn the tide. Trending Stories",
