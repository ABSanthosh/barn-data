More importantly, string is used for several vital in-game items. You can use it to create wool, looms, leads, fishing rods, bows, crossbows, and even scaffolding.WoolTo craft wool from string you'll need to have four string and arrange them in the lower left corner of the crafting table.LoomTo craft a loom, place a wood plank in the center of the crafting table and another to the left of it. Place two string above both of these blocks to create a loom.Fishing rodPlace three sticks diagonally from the bottom left to upper right corners of the crafting table. Place two string on the right side of the sticks to create a fishing rod.LeadA lead is used to capture mobs. To craft one, you'll need five string. Place four next to each other in the upper left corner of the crafting grid in a 2x2 shape, and one in the bottom right corner to create a lead.BowTo craft a bow from string, place three string down the right-hand side of the crafting grid. Place three sticks in the top middle, middle left, and bottom middle spaces to create a bow.Taking string to fishermen villagers to trade could get you some valuable items, and you can even create traps with string by turning it into tripwire. If you connect string to a tripwire hook, it'll activate whenever anything walks by. You can create traps for your fellow players in this way, or you can use it to trigger trapdoors that mobs can fall into for item farming. If you're on a multiplayer server and you spot someone else's tripwire, you can cut it with shears to avoid falling to your doom.Now that you know how to get string in Minecraft, take a look at our Minecraft guides hub, which covers everything from the most useful Minecraft tools, to how to breed Minecraft animals.
