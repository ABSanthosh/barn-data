From Delve to the east The move is kind of a big deal.  CCP even mentioned it in a news update and called it an unprecedented, this move across regions in peacetime.  Nobody is kicking us out of Delve, we’re just moving. The move has caused a good deal of flux in the game.  It is a shakeup of the status quo, which I think most external observers will agree is not a bad thing for null sec.  Delve and the path to Tenerifis is now well provisioned with gate camps and pipe bomb traps and all sorts of things that keep people busy in space. And that is totally expected.  When your enemy is on the move you go out an disrupt them if you can.  So Pandemic Horde and Fraternity have even relented on their “give Goons no content and they’ll get bored and go away” plan and have been sending fleets into Delve to catch people.  Good for them.  We’d do the same. What I didn’t expect was the rather persistent efforts by some PH pilots to turn this into a propaganda crusade.  PH is vying to be the new TEST alliance by slamming local like a Jita HyperNet spammer with the Gobbins spin on the move. As I recorded earlier in the week, Asher Elias said that the reason for the move was to get the space we would need for Equinox updates, which will be mandatory by the end of the month, and to put us on the front line with Pandemic Horde. But if you read PH in local in Delve you might think that this move was all part of a giant conspiracy by Goons to take advantage of the end of the Southeastern Agreement, which they totally cancelled unilaterally in order to take space from tiny, defenseless alliances because we’re horrible people or something.  It is all anchored on the idea that Asher lied. Things like this: Nalani Firestone : Like I get skewing the perspective, but straight up lying, and then changing the narrative 6 months later is wild Nalani Firestone \u003e “SEA isn’t renewing because horde bad, and wants the space!””We are moving to tenerifis, which is why we didn’t renew the SEA!” The core message here is that the Imperium refused to renew the southeast agreement, the SEA, because we wanted Tenerifis. Of course, there is no engaging with them in local.  They just keep chanting their lies over and over. If you haven’t been paying attention you might not know how deep this lie goes.  But I have been paying attention and have the receipts. Time for a history lesson.  Buckle up while I run the table. First up, the southeastern agreement. Back in February of 2023 Pandemic Horde and Fraternity attacked and drove the FI.RE coalition, one of the four theoretically independent coalitions (Imperium, PanFam/Winter, B2, and FI.RE), out of the southeast of null sec.  FI.RE was allowed to retreat through our space to link up with the B2 coalition in the northwest. Null Sec Coalitions Map and the FI.RE exit route Some of those groups kept on going and joined Fraternity’s Winter Coalition, but whatever.  That didn’t matter.  What mattered was the new power vacuum in the southeast.  FI.RE died, in part, because they were in the vice between the two biggest powers.  We attacked them when the let PanFam use their space to attack us and PanFam attacked them when they stopped allowing that.  Tough spot.  Who wants to live there? In response to that the Imperium and PanFam/Winter came up with an agreement to allow non-aligned small alliance take and hold space in that area.  It had some detailed provisions as to what space needed to be left alone. It was signed by the following individuals: Asher Elias of The Imperium Dark Shines of The Initiative. Gobbins of Pandemic Horde Hedliner of Pandemic Legion Noraus of Fraternity, leader of WinterCo Riotrick of Slyce Vince Draken of Nothern Coalition As you might expect, I have a whole post about that. TAGN – Southeastern Null Sec Declared Open to Non-Bloc Alliances Reddit – The South Eastern Agreement Details The agreement was for one year, at which point either side could opt not to renew it. In the mean time PanFam and Fraternity kept up their attack on the B2 Coalition in the northwest, eventually grinding them down.  In November of 2023 B2 collapsed and the remains either joined the Imperium or joined a coalition controlled by Fraternity.  We were now down to the current bipolar power dynamic. The southeast was now the next possible front between the Imperium and PanFam. As the yearlong run of the agreement came towards its close, it was announced by representatives from both sides that the agreement was going to be allowed to lapse.  On the Imperium side, the fact that PanFam allies took space in the alleged open zone almost immediately after the agreement weighed heavily on the Imperium’s decision to let it lapse. (You can check this at DOTLAN or at the Verite archive pretty easily.  For example, check who moved into Detorid during the agreement.  Gentlemen’s.Club, for example, were PanFam allies who have since folded into PH.) Reddit – The Coming End of the Agreement NEP – The South Eastern Agreement’s Final Days in Eve Online So when the date finally hit, I noted in a Friday bullet points post that the agreement was over. By the time March 2023 rolled around, the agreement was over and in the rear view mirror.  Some bemoaned its end, largely due to the bipolar nature of null sec. Time passed.  Pandemic Horde and Fraternity took some more of the space and even pushed on to the borders of the Imperium.  As I mentioned previously, they even created a special alliance named Goons Failed to Defend This System to hold sovereignty in an attempt to bait the Imperium.  They seemed keen to provoke something. Then the Equinox expansion landed and it was clearly going to change the face of null sec.  A disaster when first announced, CCP slowly relented after being shown numbers about how few viable systems there would be in null sec with their original plan.  As I wrote, it was going to be the end of farms and fields, where an alliance could live in a small footprint, and a return to the sprawling empires of the pre-Aegis sovereignty era. The Imperium, via Asher, penned an open letter to CCP about Equinox and how it was changing, from a tall to a wide, the requirement for viable null sec alliances.  Everybody would need more space.  Equinox landed in mid-June and that open letter was in early July. Come late July the Imperium opened its attack on Catch, starting by dropping a Keepstar on the same grid as PanFam’s Keepstar, a situation unprecedented in null sec history. There goes the neighborhood! PanFam and Fraternity, which both held space in the region AND had bullied a number of small alliances into letting them use their structures (and no doubt promised to defend them) put up a couple of fights and then retreated.  Their announced strategy was just to retake the space once the Imperium got bored and moved home.  A review of the situation. Headed to Catch – It Takes Two to Make a War in EVE Online The Imperium Moves on Catch as Fraternity and Pandemic Horde Stand By One Less Keepstar in U-QVWD as the Imperium Moves Towards 1P-WGB Structure Bashing as Pandemic Horde and Fraternity Avoid Fights Catch, Structures, Hell Camps, and Imperium Expansion That left Goonswarm Federation, which was taking the sovereignty, holding a lot of new space. Before: Area of Operation – July 25, 2024 And after: Area of Operation – August 18, 2024 And the Imperium kept pushing, driving back PanFam and its allies, until we ended up with that map at the top of the post.  Again, PanFam’s propaganda slant was that they would just take all the space back when the Imperium got bored. Then we declared we were moving there for keeps.  That took apart two long standing Pandemic Horde narratives.  The first was the oft repeated idea that we would get bored and go home eventually along with a bonus narrative that Goons put smaller alliances between them Pandemic Horde as meat shields. So they were left scrambling for a way to cast the Imperium as the bad guys.  Enter the Southeast Agreement. Let’s review the timeline: Feb 2023 – Southeast Agreement starts Jan 2024 – Both sides agree to let the SEA lapse March 2024- The SEA lapses, something almost unremarked upon at the time June 2024 – The Equinox expansion lands with no up front information about its impact July 2024 – Asher’s open letter to CCP about wide versus tall July 2024 – The Imperium invades Catch September 2024 – The final shape of the Equinox expansion is finally set October 2024 – The Imperium announces it will move from Delve to Tenerifis One of the things about history is, when you review it, it takes on a sense of inevitability.  This sequence of events had to have happened not only because there was no other path but because people in charge of things had a plan and moved in forward towards a very predictable end. The problem is, that is almost never the case.  History is chaos that only looks inevitable if you draw back far enough to ignore the details. In that timeline above, Asher would have needed to be a mind reader in order to predict in January that the Equinox expansion, announced on April 11th of this year, would require GSF to take more space in the east. Seriously, without Equinox there is no compelling reason to uproot the alliance and move over a few regions to the right.  We could easily… and the campaign over the summer demonstrated how easily… have taken the space as we did, put up the Keepstar in UALX-3 as we did, and then just declare a deployment and re-activate the Goon Expeditionary Force or the European Goonion or whatever grouping was handy to go out there and attack PanFam and its allies.  We have done this on dozens of occasions in the past.  Some of us only stick around because we’re waiting for the next such operation. There was no need for us to back up the moving vans and haul everything to a new home.  Asher wasn’t in the shoes of Cortes, he didn’t need to burn the boats.  There would have been an eager audience ready to move out and have some fights. But in a need to find some way to cast Asher as the bad guy… and to cover their own gross incompetence at letting us take all the space and crush all the small allies they promised to defend… Pandemic Horde had to reach back to the beginning of the year and announce that mystical, farseeing Asher somehow predicted the future and lied to them about why the Imperium did not want to renew the SEA… an agreement they too did not want to renew, as their own behavior between the end of the agreement and the Imperium invasion of Catch amply illustrates. You can declare this propaganda, and it fits the mold.  But it is the best and easiest kind of propaganda, the type that fits all the known facts and doesn’t rely on magical thinking.",

the time March 2023 rolled around, the agreement was over and in the rear view mirror.  Some bemoaned its end, largely due to the bipolar nature of null sec.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime passed.  Pandemic Horde and Fraternity took some more of the space and even pushed on to the borders of the Imperium.  As I mentioned previously, they even created a special alliance named \u003ca

seemed keen to provoke something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the \u003cem\u003eEquinox\u003c/em\u003e expansion landed and it was clearly going to change the face of null sec.  A disaster when first announced, CCP slowly relented after being shown numbers about how few viable systems there would be in null sec with their original plan.  \u003ca

\u003cem\u003eEquinox\u003c/em\u003e landed in mid-June and that open letter was in early July.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome late July the Imperium opened its attack on Catch, starting by dropping

up with that map at the top of the post.  Again, PanFam’s propaganda slant was that they would just take all the space back when the Imperium got bored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we declared we were moving there for keeps.  That took apart two long standing Pandemic Horde narratives.  The first was the oft repeated idea that we would get bored and go home eventually along with a bonus narrative that Goons put smaller alliances between them Pandemic Horde as meat shields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they were left scrambling for a way to cast the Imperium as the bad guys.  Enter the Southeast Agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s review the timeline:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFeb 2023 – Southeast Agreement starts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eJan

\u003cem\u003eEquinox\u003c/em\u003e expansion lands with no up front information about its impact\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eJuly 2024 – Asher’s open letter to CCP about wide versus

review it, it takes on a sense of inevitability.  This sequence of events had to have happened not only because there was no other path but because people in charge of things had a plan and moved in forward towards a very predictable end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is, that is almost never the case.  History is chaos that only looks inevitable if you draw back far enough to ignore the details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that timeline above, Asher would have needed to be a mind reader in order to predict in January that the \u003cem\u003eEquinox\u003c/em\u003e expansion, \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2024/04/24/eve-onlines-equinox-expansion-to-arrive-june-11th/\"\u003eannounced on April 11th of this year\u003c/a\u003e, would require GSF to take more space in the east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeriously, without \u003cem\u003eEquinox\u003c/em\u003e there is no compelling reason to uproot the alliance and move over a few regions to the right.  We could easily… and the campaign over the summer demonstrated how easily… have taken the space as we did, put up the Keepstar in UALX-3 as we did, and then just declare a deployment and re-activate the Goon Expeditionary Force or the European Goonion or whatever grouping was handy to go out there and attack PanFam and its allies.  We have done this on dozens of occasions in the past.  Some of us only stick around because we’re waiting for the next such operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no need for us to back up the moving vans and haul everything to a new home.  Asher wasn’t in the shoes of Cortes, he didn’t need to burn the boats.  There would have been an eager audience ready to move out and have some fights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in a need to find some way to cast Asher as the bad guy… and to cover their own gross incompetence at letting us take all the space and crush all the small allies they promised to defend… Pandemic Horde had to reach back to the beginning of the year and announce that mystical, farseeing Asher somehow predicted the future and lied to them about why the Imperium did not want to renew the SEA… an agreement they too did not want to renew, as their own behavior between the end of the agreement and the Imperium invasion of Catch amply illustrates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can declare this propaganda, and it fits the mold.  But it is the best and easiest kind of propaganda, the type that fits all the known facts and doesn’t rely on magical thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
