Racer Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 – Turbocharged, horror adventure Ghostwire: Tokyo and online social deduction game Death Note Killer Within launch November 5, with Death Note Killer Within launching day and date into PlayStation Plus – you can read more about it in this dedicated PS Blog post.   Let’s take a closer look at each game in turn.  Race over 130 vehicles, including Hot Wheels Originals, Hot Wheels Monster Trucks, motorbikes and ATVs, each with their unique racing style, across multiple game modes and amazing environments. Upgrade vehicles with a dedicated skill tree that will directly affect their performance. Discover 5 brand new locations, master their secrets, and you’ll feel right at home both there and on the podium. Alternatively create the track of your dreams with the powerful Track Editor, or use the best creations from the community. Ghostwire: Tokyo | PS5 Tokyo is overrun by deadly supernatural forces as a dangerous occultist causes the city’s population to vanish in an instant. Join forces with a powerful spectral entity on their quest for vengeance and master a powerful arsenal of abilities to unravel the dark truth behind the disappearance as you face the unknown in Ghostwire: Tokyo.  Death Note Killer Within | PS4, PS5  Death Note Killer Within is an online social deduction game for up to 10 players. Players will be split into two teams with different objectives. To win the game, players will need to figure out each other’s identities and either eliminate L who threatens Kira’s power or seize the Death Note. Enjoy a battle of wits as Kira and his followers, or as L and the investigators in the world of Death Note. As equally matched opponents, the two teams clash to control the game while hiding their true identities from each other. The Death Note is hidden among the players, leading to a thrilling game of cat and mouse until one team overpowers the other. Each role has its own characteristics, allowing you to master a deep sense of strategy and tactical play. Depending on your assigned role, a wide range of strategies can be formulated, and each randomized scenario develops into a high-stakes game of tactics. Last chance to download October’s games PlayStation Plus members have until November 4 to add WWE 2K24, Dead Space and Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! to their game libraries. *All three games will be available to PlayStation Plus members on November 5 until December 2. **PlayStation Plus Game Catalog lineup may differ in certain regions. Please check the PlayStation Store on launch day for your region’s lineup. Trending Stories",
