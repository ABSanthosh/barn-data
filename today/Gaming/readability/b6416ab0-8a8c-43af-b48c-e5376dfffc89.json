  "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last show you binged watched? “The Diplomat” season 2 on Netflix with Keri Russell. It’s a little silly but I like how they weave real things that happen in the world into it. 2. Have you started planning for Thanksgiving yet? Girl, no. LOL! I barely made it through the Halloween season, which honestly felt like it was three years long. I know in a few years, when Connor’s older, I’ll miss all the activities. Anyway, for Thanksgiving, we’re invited to a dinner that a friend is hosting, so we’ll probably do that. Or, we’ll just stay at home in our jammies, watch movies and have a crab fest again. So fun! 3. Pick your fall nail color – red, burgundy or dark blue? Ooh, burgundy please![Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 855 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

I’d love a touch of barely there micro shimmer and a shiny finish. 4. Peas mixed into your mashed potatoes – yes or no? Hard no. I like my mashed potatoes traditional. Lots of butter, with the option for gravy. 5. Something you’d like to accomplish this week? I’d love to carve out some time to write. Work is finally winding down a little, and so are all the activities that packed our calendar last month. I’m hoping that a little bit of breathing room will allow me to relax enough to joyfully sit at my computer and let my mind wander. I’ve had a hard time focusing lately; I’ve felt pulled in all the directions. Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon. 1. Last show you binged watched? 2. Have you started planning for Thanksgiving yet? 3. Pick your fall nail color – red, burgundy or dark blue? 4.
