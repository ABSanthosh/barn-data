The best curved gaming monitors wrap into your peripheral vision and seem to draw you in, helping you get lost in your favorite game. So whether you're a competitive gamer looking for the extra edge in esports or a single-player aficionado hoping to get lost in your next storyline, I've got the best pick for you. These are the best curved gaming monitors of 2025.TL;DR – These Are the Best Curved Gaming Monitors:There was a time when choosing a great curved gaming monitor was pretty straightforward. But today, there are countless brands flooding the marketplace, too many me-toos that look the same on paper but don't stand toe-to-toe in real life. Of course, there are qualities you should look for depending on what kind of gamer you are. If you're a fan of shooters, a monitor with low input latency and a high refresh rate, should be on the top of your list. If you're looking for the most engaging and immersive experience, choosing a monitor with a deeper curve will be a better option. It's all about the details.The Expert: Why Trust UsI've been a gaming journalist for more than a decade. During that time, I've written for a number of major gaming publications and have tested more monitors than most people will use in a lifetime. I know what makes a gaming monitor great. More specifically, I know what makes a monitor great for different kinds of users. It's not all about panel type, refresh rate, and resolution. It's about how its different qualities come together to create something great that stands out from the riff-raff on Amazon. I cover monitors for IGN and make it my mission to give you the best recommendations to both save you money and ensure that you walk away with a great experience.At IGN, we're gamers. Every review is filtered through multiple eyes to assure that you get the facts you need, when you need them.

A great gaming experience awaits. 1. Asus ROG Swift PG34WCDMBest Curved Gaming MonitorAsus ROG Swift PG34WCDMThis deep-dish 34-inch ultrawide packs next level HDR and an impressive suite of gaming features.Panel typeOLED, G-Sync compatibleHDR compatibilityDisplayHDR 400 True BlackResponse time0.03ms (GtG)Inputs1 x DisplayPort 1.4, 2 x HDMI 2.1, USB Type-C (DP and PD), 2 x USB 3.2 Type-A, 1 x USB 2.0 Type-A High peak brightness, infinite contrastBuilt-in KVM and meaningful gaming featuresDeep curve isn't great for productivityIf you're looking for the best curved gaming display, look no further than the Asus ROG Swift PG34WCDM. In my review, I found it to be a simply outstanding option for gaming and productivity alike. Its deep 800R curve is great for immersion, and its cutting-edge OLED panel offers beautiful colors and outstanding brightness.Its price fluctuates, but can usually be found for a little over $1,000. This gets you an impressive 1,300 nits of peak brightness for outstanding HDR gaming. Since it's an OLED panel, it offers deep and inky blacks. to enhance its dynamic range. Whether you're watching movies or playing games, its picture is simply stunning.is also a great fit for content creation and professional work. It's 3,440x1440p resolution is crisp and well-suited to its 34-inch corner-to-corner screen size. Think of it like two 1440p monitors side by side without the bezel in between. It comes with excellent factory calibration and wide color gamut support, so you can be confident in its results if you choose to create content on it. Be warned, its deep curve can distort text a little bit, so it may take some getting used to and is best suited for entertainment over productivity.On that front, it's built to impress. It runs at 240Hz for exceptionally smooth motion and low input latency. It also comes with a number of gaming modes to give you a competitive edge. There are the usual options like a black equalizer that allows you to peek into the shadows, but it also comes with sniper modes that zoom in on the center of your screen to help you nail those headshots. And for multi-platform gamers, you'll be pleased to find that it offers a built-in KVM to quickly swap to your console or laptop, bringing your peripherals with you. It doesn't get much better than the PG34WCDM for curved gaming monitors and does a great job of justifying its high asking price. 2. AOC C27G2ZBest Budget Curved Gaming MonitorAOC C27G2ZBudget-minded gamers will love the tight 1080p 1500R curved screen and high refresh rate.Inputs2 x HDMI 2.0, 1 x DisplayPortAOC is no stranger to delivering high-value gaming monitors for gamers on a budget. The C27G2Z is exactly such a monitor. Offering a solid picture on a spacious 27-inch screen, an immersive curve, and exceptional responsiveness with its 240Hz refresh rate, all for under $200.This monitor packs a lot for a little when it comes to investment. For its accessible cost of entry, you're getting a high-quality VA panel with a 1500R curve - still relatively gentle but more noticeable than the multitudes of 1800R monitors out there. Because of the way this panel works with its backlight, it's able to offer a deep 3,000:1 contrast ratio, roughly double that of competing IPS gaming monitors, and it's immediately noticeable. While its colors and viewing angles don't quite match that panel type's high standard, I've found VA panels still offer very engaging colors that are perfect for gaming.The monitor's real selling point, however, is its responsiveness. AOC has outfitted it with a 240Hz refresh rate and a 0.5ms response time. That's enough for even high-level competitive gaming. It allows the monitor to offer improved motion clarity in comparison to most others around this price point. Ghosting also shouldn't be an issue at these speeds.The drawback here is that to achieve its full refresh rate, you'll be limited to a DisplayPort connection since it only comes with HDMI 2.0. This won't make a big difference, though, as every modern graphics card supports this DisplayPort and consoles using HDMI port will still be able to top out at 120Hz like a great gaming TV.The AOC also sells a 32-inch version of this panel, but I would recommend sticking with the smaller size. At 32 inches, 1080p makes individual pixels visible, leading to a screen door effect that you might find distracting. If you crave the extra real estate, however, and don't mind the slightly softer image, at the time of this writing both versions are the exact same price, so it remains an impressive value. 3. Dell Alienware AW3423DWFBest Value Curved Gaming MonitorAlienware AW3423DWFA curved 2K gaming monitor with an exceptional QD-OLED panel and solid gaming chops. Panel typeQD-OLED, FreeSync Premium Pro, G-Sync compatibleBrightness1,000 cd/m2 (peak)Inputs1 x HDMI 2.0, 2 x DisplayPort, 4 x USB 3.2 Type-AFantastic picture thanks to QD-OLED panelFor the hands-down best value in curved gaming monitors, look no further than the Dell Alienware AW3423DWF. Now retailing for a bit over $600, this QD-OLED display offers massive bang for the buck. I gave it a glowing review when it released last year for $1,100 and now that the price has almost halved, it's an incredibly easy recommendation to make. OLED monitors don't come cheap, and there's a good reason for that. Their advanced panel technology allows them to deliver some of the best images quality money can buy. Because of the way, because it, every pixel is individually controlled, it essentially allows the AW3423DWF to have millions of local dimming zones. On top of that, it's been enhanced with a layer of quantum dots to provide more vivid colors and increased brightness. Its picture is stunning and with its current pricing, it's one of the best ways to experience OLED for yourself while also enjoying an immersive curve.Like all OLED monitors, its SDR brightness isn't amazing, but if you use it out of direct sunlight, it should be just fine. When gaming in HDR, however, it's able to peak at 1000 nits. Between this high brightness and its deep contrast, its HDR experience for both movies and games is a treat for the eyes - and that's without considering Alienware's picture enhancements and presets. This display runs at a peak of 165Hz, which while not the absolute fastest, is still a good value for a QD-OLED at this price. And don't forget, because of the way OLED monitors work, it will still be much more responsive than your average IPS or VA display. In fact, while most of those monitors run at 1ms, and the very best might be rated for 0.5ms, this monitor is rated for only 0.3 ms. For competitive gaming and esports, that means improved motion clarity and an exceptionally smooth experience (and yes, it also supports AMD FreeSync and is Nvidia G-Sync Compatible). Overall, there is not much to dislike about this monitor at its current asking price. It received glowing reviews when it launched, my own included, and has only gotten better with time and multiple price cuts as Alienware has released its own competitors.4. Acer Predator X34 OLEDBest Ultrawide G-Sync Gaming MonitorAcer Predator X34 OLEDHDRVESA DisplayHDR True Black 400Brightness1,300 cd/m2 (peak)Inputs2 x HDMI 2.1, 1 x DisplayPort 1.4, 2 x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C800R curve works for content creation but isn't the best for productivitySo far this year, the reigning king of ultrawide curved gaming monitors is the Acer Predator X34 OLED. It checks all of the boxes for a great gaming monitor, including an outstanding picture, fast refresh rate, deep curve, and plenty of features to take your gaming experience to the next level.This monitor isn't the only 34-inch ultrawide on this list. It offers quite a bit to set itself apart. Its curve offers a deep 800R radius that wraps into your peripheral vision and seems to draw you into the center of the screen to increase your immersion. Between its variable refresh rate support (Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync) and 240Hz refresh rate, all of the motion of your favorite games flows with a silky smoothness that looks amazing. Since this monitor comes with the ultrawide version of 1440p, you won't need a top tier system to run it. Though, you should plan on at least a medium performance graphics card for the best experience. Its OLED panel offers fantastic colors with solid factory calibration. Compared to many other OLED monitors, however, it offers superior brightness with a peak luminance of 1,300 nits. This allows highlights to glimmer with a lifelike quality that helps bring games and movies to lifeIf you are a content creator and work with timelines, you'll surely see the benefit of its 21:9 ratio. This allows you to view more of the timeline at any given time and makes the monitor feel much more efficient to use. It lacks a dedicated sRGB mode, which is strange, but does come with a P3 mode for standardized colors.There are a lot of curved ultra-wide gaming monitors out there, but the Acer Predator X34 OLED is the premier option for 2025.5. MSI MPG 491CQPXBest Curved 32:9 Super Ultrawide Monitor MSI MPG 491CQPX49 inches of QD-OLED gaming goodnessHDRVESA DisplayHDR True Black 400Brightness1,000 cd/m2 (peak)Inputs2 x HDMI 2.1, 1 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x USB Type-C (DP/PD 98W), 2 x USB 2.0 Type-AGreat for productivity as well as gamingUSB Type-C video and PD chargingBurn-in prevention features can be gratingIf you have a need for speed, er... space, then look no further than the MSI MPG 491CQPX. This 49-inch, 32:9 monitor is packed with features and a gorgeous, fast QD-OLED screen. It offers plentiful connectivity and enough screen real estate that it can completely replace a triple monitor setup all on its own. So-called \"super ultrawide monitors\" aren't for everyone, but if you have the space, it can be a transformative experience for gaming and productivity alike. This 5,120 x 1,440 resolution screen is equivalent to three 1440p monitors side-by-side. Many users enjoy splitting the space into multiple windows, increasing their ability to multitask. Using this display, you could run a game in one portion, a stream in another, and monitor chat in a third. It's versatile in a way, smaller monitors aren't able to be.Just because it's big doesn't mean that MSI has cut corners in other areas. Its display runs at 240Hz with a 0.03ms response time for truly exceptional motion clarity and performance suited to professional esports. Its 1800R curve is relatively gentle, but because it's so wide, is more meaningful and allows you to take in more of the screen at once. Its panel is enhanced with a quantum dot layer for improved colors and brightness, and the company has outfitted it with a heat-dispersing graphene layer internally to enhance its long-term durability. It also supports USB Type-C video input and 98W of PD charging to easily connect and charge your laptop. A screen this large demands a relatively powerful computer, however. It's nearly as demanding as 4K, so if you plan to maximize its 240Hz refresh rate, you'll need a relatively beefy GPU (check out our list of the best graphics cards for suggestions.) Some users have also found its burn-in protection features to be a little overzealous with how often they remind you. They are effective, however, and go in line with MSI's three-year burn-in warranty so you can buy with confidence knowing that it will replace your panel should anything happen during the warranty term. This size monitor isn't for everybody, but if you enjoy using multiple monitors at once, it's a great way to accomplish that much more seamlessly. And since this monitor regularly sells for less than $1,000, it could even be more cost effective than picking up three separate monitors to use side by side.How to Choose a Curved MonitorChoosing a curved gaming monitor is very similar to choosing a great gaming monitor in general. It's important to consider what you will be using it for. If all you need to worry about is gaming, then that will narrow your choices down. If you plan to use it for productivity or creative work like video editing, there are other things to consider.Resolution: Resolution refers to how many pixels make up the panel of the monitor. A higher resolution leads to a crisper image, however, can be more difficult to run requiring a higher performance graphics card. The three main resolutions are 1080p (1,920x1,080), 1440p (2,560x1,440), and 4K (3,840 x 2,160). Ultrawide monitors extend the first figure with their added width, but the second usually remains the same and can be used to determine the level of clarity they will provide. Size: Choosing the right size monitor for your needs depends on several factors. The most basic is how much available space you have. Along with this, however, you should consider the type of gaming experience you are seeking. If you're choosing a curved monitor simply for the aesthetic, a gentle curve and 16:9 aspect ratio is probably going to fit your needs. If you want lots of extra usable space, then choosing a larger ultrawide (21:9) curved monitor will likely be the better choice.While they're not hard rules, there are some basic guidelines to consider when it comes to size. For 1080p, 24 inches is usually considered the sweet spot, offering crisp visuals across a decently-sized field of view. For 1440p, 27 inches is considered ideal for this same reason. If you're opting for 4K, however, 32 inches is frequently recommended as it's large enough to offer a high pixel density without losing details to a compressed screen. You can shift any of these resolutions up in size but at the expense of a slightly softer image. For 1080p in particular, at 27 inches and above, you risk being able to see the individual pixels which create a \"screen door effect\" across the viewing area.Panel Type: The next thing to consider is the type of panel being used in the display. There are three main panels being used today and one backlighting type that often gets referred to as if it were its own panel technology. The three types are IPS, VA, and OLED. TN panels are technically also available but offer the worst picture available in mainstream gaming monitors and should only be picked if you value response time over literally everything else (I suggest avoiding them). The backlighting technology is called mini-LED and is most often paired with IPS panels.IPS, or In-Plane Switching, panels are well-loved for their great colors and viewing angles. They used to be plagued by slower response times, and while that is technically still true, there are many that offer 1ms or even 0.5ms response times, so that concern is largely a thing of the past among gaming monitors. Older and lower cost IPS monitors can still have significantly slower response times and problems with ghosting, however, so it's important to take note of its rated response time before pulling the trigger. IPS panels also offer relatively low contrast, which can make blacks look dark gray. Backlight bleed can also be an issue.VA, or Vertical Alignment, panels are a middle-ground between the benefits of IPS and the speed of OLED and TN. They're backlit using LEDs. However, because of the way the pixels operate, they block light where IPS panels would allow it through. This allows them to offer much better contrast while still maintaining very good colors and a slightly faster response time.OLED, or Organic Light Emitting Diode, monitors are the current key trend in the upper-middle and high tier of curved gaming monitors. With this technology, each pixel is individually controlled, only illuminating what's needed at any given time. Put another way, every pixel becomes its own local dimming zone, adjusting brightness right to the point of turning off, allowing this technology to offer the best contrast available in gaming monitors today. They're also well known for their incredible color and stunning HDR. The downside to these monitors is that they frequently have low average brightness due to their higher power consumption and heat. Burn-in or image retention is another concern; however, manufacturers have gotten very good about covering burn-in under their included warranties, as well as integrating many different protective features to make this less likely to occur. It is still an important consideration, though, and an inherent risk to the panel type.Brightness: A monitor's brightness is rated in nits or candelas per square meter (cdm/2). As a rule, I recommend aiming for at least 350 nits of brightness if your desk is out of direct sunlight and higher if your budget allows. 400 nits is necessary for the first level of VESA DisplayHDR certification; however, you should take that with a grain of salt. For HDR gaming and movies, I suggest looking for a monitor with a peak brightness of at least 1,000 nits so that you can experience true wide dynamic range. Refresh Rate: Refresh rate is how many times the monitor updates its picture per second. For gaming, I recommend sticking to at least 120Hz, with 144Hz being the ideal starting point. If you are a competitive gamer, a 240Hz, 360Hz, or even 480Hz monitor can be a better choice as they offer lower input latency and better motion clarity. Anyone that is not gaming at at least a semi-professional level, however, isn't likely to experience the same benefit and competitive edge, so I recommend sticking to more affordable refresh speeds and reinvesting those funds elsewhere into your PC or into new games.Curvature: A monitor's curvature is indicated by an \"R\" number that is usually clearly disclosed in the product listing. On Amazon, it usually features prominently in the listing's title. The \"R\" stands for radius. If the arc of the screen were to extend into a circle, the number would indicate its width. Accordingly, a higher \"R\" number means a shallower curve. It can be tempting to go for the deepest curve possible. However, it's important to note that anything at 1000R or below is very deep and will likely distort images and text a small degree. This makes them a better fit for pure gaming instead of productivity and other daily use tasks.Additional Features: If you've already shopped around for a monitor, then you're probably already aware that there are a lot of curved displays with the exact same specs. It's here that you can begin to differentiate them from one another. An important thing to look for is support for variable refresh rate (VRR). This feature eliminates screen tearing and can include Low Framerate Compensation (LFC) to help your games play smoothly even if your computer struggles to run them. If you have an AMD graphics card, you'll want to be sure the monitor supports FreeSync. If you have an NVIDIA graphics card, it should be at least G-Sync compatible to ensure smooth, tear-free gameplay. Likewise, there are many extra features that manufacturers will add to increase the value proposition and help each display stand out. If you intend to have multiple systems or a console hooked up in addition to your PC, choosing a monitor with a built-in KVM switch can make life more convenient. If you want to enjoy two different kinds of content, looking for one that offers picture-in-picture support can be wise. Many gaming monitors also offer configuration software that can save you fumbling through the on-screen display (OSD) and even offer hotkeys to toggle settings and features. These can include features like Black Equalizer that let you peek into the shadows, on-screen reticles, or even built-in sniper modes that can zoom in on enemies. Some monitors even feature integrated AI to change contrast and picture settings depending on what's occurring in-game.Upcoming Curved Gaming Monitors in 2025There are always new gaming monitors being released, so rather than looking at individual models, it's helpful to look at the biggest trends guiding the industry. This year I was able to attend CES in Las Vegas and see many of the upcoming models firsthand. I have a full write-up of what's coming down the pipeline you can read here. The biggest trend this year is once again OLED. Just about every major brand has multiple OLED displays the pipeline, spanning different for factors, designs, and intended audiences (though they're not always curved). Mini-LED monitors also look like they may be rising up as an alternative to this technology, solving the problems of brightness and burn-in at the expense of OLED's inky contrast. While most brands focused on their most premium and expensive models, there were also a number aimed at the middle of the market with more accessible prices. Another trend to look out for this year is the collision of smart TVs with gaming monitors. Smart gaming monitors were a theme of the show. I reviewed an early model from Samsung at the end of last year that showcases the highlights of this approach: built-in game and movie streaming, live TV, and refined menus with TV-like picture settings. While I wasn't huge on the integration in that display, there's natural appeal for anyone that needs their monitor to serve double duty. Students in dorm rooms and gamers in small spaces should find a lot to enjoy in this current crop of smart monitors. Curved Monitor FAQsAre curved monitors better for gaming?Many gamers think so, though this is in the eye of the beholder. In my experience, gentler curves are less perceptible and are more about the overall look of the monitor rather than practical impact. The influence of the monitor's curvature also depends on the size of the display. On smaller monitors, it's less noticeable, but on ultrawide gaming monitors, it can occupy more of your field of view and help create the effect of being drawn into the center of your screen. In terms of performance and responsiveness, a monitor's curve doesn't have an impact.What is 800R, 1500R, and 1800R?These numbers indicate the radius of the curvature on a gaming monitor. A lower radius indicates a deeper curve, whereas a higher radius is shallower. 1500R and 1800R curvatures are very gentle. 800R and 1000R, however, feel exceptionally curved and extend further into your peripheral vision. A very deep curve can be a gateway to immersion but can slightly warp text and objects that appear on the screen. This usually isn't very profound, and many gamers get used to it over time, yet if you do a lot of writing or are sensitive to this it can be distracting. I recommend leaving the deepest curves for gaming alone and opting for something a bit gentler for mixed use.Are curved monitors good for work?The answer to this question depends on the radius of the curve and the type of work that you'll be doing. Generally speaking, 1500R and 1800R curves are good for just about everything as their curvature is very mild. As mentioned in the previous answer, very deep curves usually aren't the best if you're doing a lot of typing or spreadsheet work due to the warping that can occur. A curved ultrawide monitor can be a big asset for video editors and other creatives that use timelines in their work. Since these displays offer more horizontal space, you're able to view more of your timeline at any given time, and many people find this increases their efficiency. Outside of this use case and limited others, curved gaming monitors do not typically offer clear benefits compared to flat displays.Where to Get the Best Curved Gaming Monitors in the UK AOC C27G2 Asus TUF Gaming VG34VQEL1ABest Curved G-Sync Gaming Monitor LG UltraGear 34GP950G-BBest Curved FreeSync Gaming Monitor MSI Optix MAG342CQRVBest G-Sync Compatible Curved Gaming Monitor Asus TUF Gaming VG35VQBest G-Sync Compatible Curved Gaming MonitorBest Ultra-Ultrawide Curved Gaming Monitor Samsung Odyssey G9Best Ultra-Ultrawide Curved Gaming MonitorBest Curved Gaming Monitor for Esports MSI Optix MAG301CR2Samsung Odyssey Neo G9Chris Coke has been a regular contributor to IGN since 2019 and has been covering games and technology since 2013.

Because of the way this panel works with its backlight, it\u0026#39;s able to offer a deep 3,000:1 contrast ratio, roughly double that of competing IPS gaming monitors, and it\u0026#39;s immediately noticeable. While its colors and viewing angles don\u0026#39;t quite match that panel type\u0026#39;s high standard, I\u0026#39;ve found VA panels still offer very engaging colors that are perfect for gaming.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThe monitor\u0026#39;s real selling point, however, is its responsiveness.

On top of that, it\u0026#39;s been enhanced with a layer of quantum dots to provide more vivid colors and increased brightness.

This 5,120 x 1,440 resolution screen is equivalent to three 1440p monitors side-by-side. Many users enjoy splitting the space into multiple windows, increasing their ability to multitask. Using this display, you could run a game in one portion, a stream in another, and monitor chat in a third.

It\u0026#39;s important to consider what you will be using it for. If all you need to worry about is gaming, then that will narrow your choices down. If you plan to use it for productivity or creative work like video editing, there are other things to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eResolution: \u003c/strong\u003eResolution refers to how many pixels make up the panel of the monitor. A higher resolution leads to a crisper image, however, can be more difficult to run requiring a higher performance graphics card. The three main resolutions are 1080p (1,920x1,080), 1440p (2,560x1,440), and 4K (3,840 x 2,160). Ultrawide monitors extend the first figure with their added width, but the second usually remains the same and can be used to determine the level of clarity they will provide. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSize: \u003c/strong\u003eChoosing the right size monitor for your needs depends on several factors. The most basic is how much available space you have. Along with this, however, you should consider the type of gaming experience you are seeking. If you\u0026#39;re choosing a curved monitor simply for the aesthetic, a gentle curve and 16:9 aspect ratio is probably going to fit your needs. If you want lots of extra usable space, then choosing a larger ultrawide (21:9) curved monitor will likely be the better choice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eWhile they\u0026#39;re not hard rules, there are some basic guidelines to consider when it comes to size.  For 1080p, 24 inches is usually considered the sweet spot, offering crisp visuals across a decently-sized field of view.  For 1440p, 27 inches is considered ideal for this same reason. If you\u0026#39;re opting for 4K, however, 32 inches is frequently recommended as it\u0026#39;s large enough to offer a high pixel density without losing details to a compressed screen. You can shift any of these resolutions up in size but at the expense of a slightly softer image. For 1080p in particular, at 27 inches and above,  you risk being able to see the individual pixels which create a \u0026#34;screen door effect\u0026#34; across the viewing area.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePanel Type: \u003c/strong\u003eThe next thing to consider is the type of panel being used in the display. There are three main panels being used today and one backlighting type that often gets referred to as if it were its own panel technology. The three types are IPS, VA, and OLED. TN panels are technically also available but offer the worst picture available in mainstream gaming monitors and should only be picked if you value response time over literally everything else (I suggest avoiding them). The backlighting technology is called mini-LED and is most often paired with IPS panels.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eIPS, or In-Plane Switching, panels are well-loved for their great colors and viewing angles. They used to be plagued by slower response times, and while that is technically still true, there are many that offer 1ms or even 0.5ms response times, so that concern is largely a thing of the past among gaming monitors. Older and lower cost IPS monitors can still have significantly slower response times and problems with ghosting, however, so it\u0026#39;s important to take note of its rated response time before pulling the trigger. IPS panels also offer relatively low contrast, which can make blacks look dark gray. Backlight bleed can also be an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eVA, or Vertical Alignment, panels are a middle-ground between the benefits of IPS and the speed of OLED and TN. They\u0026#39;re backlit using LEDs. However, because of the way the pixels operate, they block light where IPS panels would allow it through. This allows them to offer much better contrast while still maintaining very good colors and a slightly faster response time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eOLED, or Organic Light Emitting Diode, monitors are the current key trend in the upper-middle and high tier of curved gaming monitors. With this technology, each pixel is individually controlled, only illuminating what\u0026#39;s needed at any given time. Put another way, every pixel becomes its own local dimming zone, adjusting brightness right to the point of turning off, allowing this technology to offer the best contrast available in gaming monitors today. They\u0026#39;re also well known for their incredible color and stunning HDR. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThe downside to these monitors is that they frequently have low average brightness due to their higher power consumption and heat. Burn-in or image retention is another concern; however, manufacturers have gotten very good about covering burn-in under their included warranties, as well as integrating many different protective features to make this less likely to occur. It is still an important consideration, though, and an inherent risk to the panel type.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrightness:\u003c/strong\u003e A monitor\u0026#39;s brightness is rated in nits or candelas per square meter (cdm/2). As a rule, I recommend aiming for at least 350 nits of brightness if your desk is out of direct sunlight and higher if your budget allows. 400 nits is necessary for the first level of VESA DisplayHDR certification; however, you should take that with a grain of salt. For HDR gaming and movies, I suggest looking for a monitor with a peak brightness of at least 1,000 nits so that you can experience true wide dynamic range. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRefresh Rate: \u003c/strong\u003eRefresh rate is how many times the monitor updates its picture per second. For gaming, I recommend sticking to at least 120Hz, with 144Hz being the ideal starting point. If you are a competitive gamer, a 240Hz, 360Hz, or even 480Hz monitor can be a better choice as they offer lower input latency and better motion clarity. Anyone that is not gaming at at least a semi-professional level, however, isn\u0026#39;t likely to experience the same benefit and competitive edge, so I recommend sticking to more affordable refresh speeds and reinvesting those funds elsewhere into your PC or into new games.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurvature: \u003c/strong\u003eA monitor\u0026#39;s curvature is indicated by an \u0026#34;R\u0026#34; number that is usually clearly disclosed in the product listing. On Amazon, it usually features prominently in the listing\u0026#39;s title. The \u0026#34;R\u0026#34; stands for radius. If the arc of the screen were to extend into a circle, the number would indicate its width. Accordingly, a higher \u0026#34;R\u0026#34; number means a shallower curve. It can be tempting to go for the deepest curve possible.  However, it\u0026#39;s important to note that anything at 1000R or below is very deep and will likely distort images and text a small degree. This makes them a better fit for pure gaming instead of productivity and other daily use tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdditional Features: \u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0026#39;ve already shopped around for a monitor, then you\u0026#39;re probably already aware that there are a lot of curved displays with the exact same specs. It\u0026#39;s here that you can begin to differentiate them from one another. An important thing to look for is support for variable refresh rate (VRR). This feature eliminates screen tearing and can include Low Framerate Compensation (LFC) to help your games play smoothly even if your computer struggles to run them. If you have an AMD graphics card, you\u0026#39;ll want to be sure the monitor supports FreeSync. If you have an NVIDIA graphics card, it should be at least G-Sync compatible to ensure smooth, tear-free gameplay. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eLikewise, there are many extra features that manufacturers will add to increase the value proposition and help each display stand out. If you intend to have multiple systems or a console hooked up in addition to your PC, choosing a monitor with a built-in KVM switch can make life more convenient. If you want to enjoy two different kinds of content, looking for one that offers picture-in-picture support can be wise. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eMany gaming monitors also offer configuration software that can save you fumbling through the on-screen display (OSD) and even offer hotkeys to toggle settings and features. These can include features like Black Equalizer that let you peek into the shadows, on-screen reticles, or even built-in sniper modes that can zoom in on enemies. Some monitors even feature integrated AI to change contrast and picture settings depending on what\u0026#39;s occurring in-game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"upcoming-in-2025\"\u003e\u003ch2 data-cy=\"title2\" data-toc-title=\"Upcoming in 2025\"\u003eUpcoming Curved Gaming Monitors in 2025\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThere are always new gaming monitors being released, so rather than looking at individual models, it\u0026#39;s helpful to look at the biggest trends guiding the industry.

Just about every major brand has multiple OLED displays the pipeline, spanning different for factors, designs, and intended audiences (though they\u0026#39;re not always curved). Mini-LED monitors also look like they may be rising up as an alternative to this technology, solving the problems of brightness and burn-in at the expense of OLED\u0026#39;s inky contrast. While most brands focused on their most premium and expensive models, there were also a number aimed at the middle of the market with more accessible prices. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eAnother trend to look out for this year is the collision of smart TVs with gaming monitors. Smart gaming monitors were a theme of the show.

In my experience, gentler curves are less perceptible and are more about the overall look of the monitor rather than practical impact. The influence of the monitor\u0026#39;s curvature also depends on the size of the display. On smaller monitors, it\u0026#39;s less noticeable, but on ultrawide gaming monitors, it can occupy more of your field of view and help create the effect of being drawn into the center of your screen. In terms of performance and responsiveness, a monitor\u0026#39;s curve doesn\u0026#39;t have an impact.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 data-cy=\"title3\"\u003eWhat is 800R, 1500R, and 1800R?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThese numbers indicate the radius of the curvature on a gaming monitor. A lower radius indicates a deeper curve, whereas a higher radius is shallower. 1500R and 1800R curvatures are very gentle. 800R and 1000R, however, feel exceptionally curved and extend further into your peripheral vision. A very deep curve can be a gateway to immersion but can slightly warp text and objects that appear on the screen. This usually isn\u0026#39;t very profound, and many gamers get used to it over time, yet if you do a lot of writing or are sensitive to this it can be distracting. I recommend leaving the deepest curves for gaming alone and opting for something a bit gentler for mixed use.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 data-cy=\"title3\"\u003eAre curved monitors good for work?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThe answer to this question depends on the radius of the curve and the type of work that you\u0026#39;ll be doing. Generally speaking, 1500R and 1800R curves are good for just about everything as their curvature is very mild. As mentioned in the previous answer, very deep curves usually aren\u0026#39;t the best if you\u0026#39;re doing a lot of typing or spreadsheet work due to the warping that can occur. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eA curved ultrawide monitor can be a big asset for video editors and other creatives that use timelines in their work.
