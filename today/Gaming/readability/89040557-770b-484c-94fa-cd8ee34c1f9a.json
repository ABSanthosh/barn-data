  "description": "It’s almost dusk here at Casa de MBB, and we’re getting cleaned up and ready for bed, but I still wanted to wish you a Happy Mother’s Day. There’s so much to say about Mother’s Day, isn’t there? It can be an emotional day in many ways for many reasons, different for everyone. People have such different relationships with their parents and their children and all of the creatures they care for, and life is fleeting. We all lose our care givers and loved ones someday, and days like today mean different things to all of us at different times in our lives. I pray and hope your day was good to you. Every Mother’s Day, just like every other day, I also think about Tabs. Oh! — sometimes when I see an old picture like this one below, I tear up, especially on Mother’s Day.

I sure miss my special boy! Rosie As you may or may not know, Rosie the Magnificent has her own connection to Mother’s Day because she is… A mother! Happy Mother’s Day, Rosie. This is one of her brood. These were pictures I took when she still lived with my friend, who was Rosie’s foster family in 2019. It was a few months after Tabs crossed the Rainbow Bridge, and I missed being around cats. Visiting Rosie and getting to know her helped me with my grief. These pics were taken shortly after Rosie had kittens, and I really got to see how caring and sweet she was. Rosie did a great job, and all of her kittens were adopted. Over those months in 2019, Rosie’s loving nature guided me to open up my heart to a feline friend again, and now she’s a member of our family. Happy Mother’s Day, Rosie, and to you as well. ❤️ Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen Reader Interactions",
