Where to Read Batman OnlineStart For Free on DC's WebsiteFree Comics on the DC Comics WebsiteIf you're not sure where to start or want to check out multiple series before fully diving in, we recommend checking out DC's official site, where they offer the first issue of many ongoing series for free. DC Go! Edition comics are made to work seamlessly on desktop or mobile. This is a great way to decide which comic is the best for you!Hoopla is a Great Way to Read For FreeFree Batman Comics on HooplaHoopla is an online service for borrowing digital books and comics for free, but your selection may vary based on location. To use Hoopla, you must first have a library card and set your location to your nearest library. Your available selection is based on whatever books or comics that library has at the time, so for ongoing series, Hoopla may not be the move for you. However, older runs like Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee's Batman: Hush or Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns are more widely accessible. Kindle and ComiXology are the Easiest Routes to Digital ReadingRead New Batman Issues on KindleKindle and ComiXology also have older runs available, like Alan Moore's The Killing Joke, but reading ongoing series like Scott Snyder's Absolute Batman or Philip Kennedy Johnson's Batman and Robin is easily done here. You can browse their selection with a free trial of ComiXology Unlimited, giving you access to thousands of digital titles. Also, new issues are available every Wednesday just like physical comics. This is arguably one of the easiest places to read some of the best Batman comics and graphic novels without too much hassle.GlobalComix is a Useful AlternativeGlobalComix Is Free to Sign Up forGlobalComix is a creator-focused reading and distribution platform that helps comic creators monetize and gain analytics from their digital comics.
