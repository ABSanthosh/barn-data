  "text": "Don't tell my insurance people, the premiums on an Aerondight are high enough already Image credit: CD Projekt If you're reading this, it may be too late. The mysterious genius behind Cyberpunk 2077's most popular flying car mod has just released its first update in a good while, alongside a fresh work that removes the speed limits the game applies to all of its vehicles. It looks like the perfect recipe for my next trip to Night City ending with an shattered engine block wedged halfway up a skyscraper, and Keanny Reevhand standing next to it tutting. If you're not familiar with Let There Be Flight by modder Jack Humbert, it arrived in September 2022, swapped the wheels of Cyberpunk's cars for working thrusters, and left plenty of folks wondering why dystopian futures are ever allowed to omit flying cars. After all, when the world's gone down the corporate tubes, surely you need to balance that out by letting people dream of drifting a futuristic VW golf ten thousand feet above the pavement? I digress. Humbert's just updated Let There Be Flight for the first time since June 2023, which is welcome news since folks have reported issues getting it to run with the game's more recent patches. \"I've been rewriting some parts of LTBF to better use in-game systems, and this has allowed for better state control of flight and input contexts, enabling native vehicle combat (handheld and vehicle-mounted) while flying,\" he wrote, \"This should also make it more compatible with other vehicle-based mods (in theory), but I have yet to try things out on a wide scale...I have lots of ideas that I'd like to see implemented, and will try to get them finished to a point that you can at least try them out here.\" Nice, but here's the kicker, alongside this update Humbert's uploaded his first new mod since 2022. It's Vehicle Speed Unlimiter and gets rid of the automatic limits the game puts on car movement speed - as far as I can tell, the ones you'd bang your head against even if you modded or file tweaked a car to go beyond its base top speed value. The mod's description says speeds above 400mph will be possible, and to make clear what that's done, a user with the handle Oranje3 has said they've already used it to get a modded car up to 1222mph, and posted a screenshot to back that assertion up. Needless to say, I now have a new mission in life. I'll have to find the time to get my Cyberpunk load order back to working order since I've not done a playthrough in a little bit, but if I do soon, I'll definitely be trying to better that speed. In a flying car too, assuming that doesn't prove a barrier to engaging warp speed. If you want to try Vehicle Speed Unlimiter, you'll need to grab RED4ext, while Let There Be Flight requires that plus ArchiveXL, Input Loader, Mod Settings, Redscript, and TweakXL.",
