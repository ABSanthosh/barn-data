In the words of Todd Howard, everything about the game “just works.”Well, almost everything works. The sink in my pilot’s personal quarters, however, does not.This might seem like a tiny, insignificant detail, and in the grand scheme of gameplay, it is. But I have concerns about the lack of a functional sink, mainly because my pilot’s bedroom does have a functional toilet.Let me explain. When not actively playing a match in Mecha Break, you can take control of your pilot and jog around the dropship the game’s pilots and Strikers call home. In your pilot’s quarters, they can recline on their bed, sit at their desk, mess around on their PC, or take advantage of the various amenities in their bathroom. These amenities include a fully-functional shower. When the shower is activated, a rather voyeuristic cutscene plays in which you can watch your pilot bathe. The pilot is clearly nude, but it’s hard to make out any details, as the privacy glass and shower steam effectively censor any actual nudity.When interacting with the toilet, a similar scene plays out with my pilot sitting on the porcelain throne, still blurred out by the bathroom’s privacy glass. But I find this scene far more disturbing than the shower. Unlike the shower scene, the toilet-using cutscene makes it clear that my pilot is still fully clothed in her skin-tight bodysuit. I’ve inspected the suit closely, and there are no zippers or bum-flaps to be found, so I can only assume that my pilot is using the restroom through her bodysuit. Unless Mecha Break’s pilots have stillsuit technology, that outfit’s gotta be a walking septic tank.Even more alarming is the sink, or rather, the lack of a working one. Unlike the shower and the toilet, interacting with the sink will simply cause it to emerge from or close up into the wall, Murphy bed-style. Interact with it again, and it will fold outward. But at no point does a cutscene play in which my pilot washes her hands. The sink doesn’t appear to have running water.My pilot works very hard, spending most of her days piloting her Striker-of-choice, Alysnes. Her bodysuit is tight and covers everything except for her face. It’s gotta get sweaty inside Alysnes’ cockpit, but after a long day of beating up other Strikers, my pilot can’t even escape her bodysuit to use the restroom, and once she’s done using the restroom, the only option for sanitation is a shower. How are Mecha Break’s pilots supposed to avoid spreading illnesses around the ship when they can’t even wash their hands? Surely this is a Space OSHA violation.I’m begging you, Mecha Break devs. If you’re going to force my poor pilot to poop in a one-piece, skin-tight bodysuit — and make me watch while it happens — at least give her a working sink to wash her hands in afterwards.",
