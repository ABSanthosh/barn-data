  "text": "Balls, Dice \u0026 Stickers asks you to launch a ball at some dice that trigger a ton of ridiculous effects each time you hit them. I am not sure what I did to upset paperclips, mice, and the manifestations of the past, but they’re all here to give me a hard time unless I beat them up with some damaging dice. I won’t be rolling those dice, though. That would be a little too straightforward in this delightfully chaotic game. Instead, I’ll be launching a ball at the dice and trying to get the ball to bounce around the room, hitting the dice as much as possible before the ball pings out the bottom of the screen. Except THAT is also not all there is to it. Each round, you get a sticker you can apply to one of your dice. These stickers cause wildly varied effects that often build off of the other stickers. For instance, you can add a beehive to one of the dice. This can spawn a bee, which in turn will shoot needles at certain things and will like other objects. Tape adds a banana to the playing field which can provide you points. The Pub spawns a drunk driver, and that drunk driver might get caught by the police car that you spawn from landing on another die. And these dice effects all stack on top of one another as you progress through the rounds, resulting in a bustling field of dozens of bizarre, silly effects all working in tandem with one another. Balls, Dice \u0026 Stickers is really something to behold after you’ve got a few rounds under your belt. Describing it really doesn’t do justice to how much fun this game is once it gets rolling, so I highly recommend trying out the alpha build on itch.io. I can’t even imagine how much sillier it’s going to get in its full release. Balls, Dice \u0026 Stickers is availble now (in an alpha format) on itch.io. You can add the future full release of the game to your Wishlist on Steam.
