Right now Amazon has Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Gaming OC graphics cards in stock starting at $899.99 shipped. Inventory is reserved for Amazon Prime members only.Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU in Stock on AmazonAmazon Prime members only for some modelsAlthough the MSRP for these cards range from $899.99 to $999.99, a reference GeForce RTX 5070 Ti card is actually supposed to sell for $750. More advanced cooling designs, a more uncommon colorway, or overclocking out of the box add to the cost, but even then, admittedly, these cards are still priced higher than AMD originally intended.The reality is that even third party manufacturers like Gigabyte, MSI, Asus (and pretty much everyone else) are also taking advantage of the high demand by marking prices up from the get-go. Unfortunately, you'd be hard pressed to find another RTX 5070 Ti GPU for this price or less. RTX 5070 Ti GPUs are generally selling for over $1,000 on eBay.The RTX 5070 Ti GPU Has Excellent 4K Gaming PerformanceOf all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and already marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution with ray tracing enabled. Heck, even if you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti might be the better value than the RTX 50870 since both are equipped with the same 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
