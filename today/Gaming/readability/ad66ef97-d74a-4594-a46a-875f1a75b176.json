  "text": "Cozy Dungeons is a game about clearing monsters out of crypts and castles, then renovating them for new folks to move in. There have been a lot of games that have mixed different play styles and genres. Often, when you are destroying everything in a dungeon, leaving piles of slime and blood behind, you don’t really think about who is going to end up living or using the space afterwards. Well, this game has you defeating enemies then putting the rooms back together to complete specific requirements so that everyone can be happy in their home. The actual dungeon fighting in Cozy Dungeons feels simple and fun. You can use your sword to destroy all of the enemies in each room, clearing it out. Some rooms also have block-pushing puzzles or button puzzles like you’d see in most dungeon crawlers. Where this game then feels different is through the decorating. Rooms have different requirements to be sold, which you might only really figure out through listening to the NPCs that are currently trying to live in the room. They’ll give you hints as to what they want. You will then need to design the room, adding in specific items they want or getting rid of things that have grown old and tired in the rooms. It’s quite fun to decorate and there is a lot of freedom, especially as you unlock new items to place and mess around with. Some rooms, from moving items, have secret doors into new areas that you might have not even discovered if you didn’t take the time to fix the place up. I got the chance to play through a few rounds of Cozy Dungeons at The Mix, where I found these two very different concepts of fighting and designing fit together perfectly. The cutesy graphic style also makes it all link up, even if there are puddles of slime that need to be swept up before you are able to start decorating! The dual phases mean you do not have to worry about enemies when trying to design, which is another plus. Cozy Dungeons is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
