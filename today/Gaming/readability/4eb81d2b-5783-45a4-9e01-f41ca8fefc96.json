  "text": "Hello, my name is Martin, and I’m the CEO and Creative Director of Flatter Than Earth, the studio behind the theatrical adventure platformer Once Upon a Puppet. Our magical, story-driven 2.5D puzzle-platformer takes place in a vibrant world of theatre, where classic platforming meets puppet-inspired gameplay in a tale of friendship, self-discovery, and redemption. You’ll play as Drev, an ambitious Actor, and Nieve, a talented Stagehand and Tailor. Bound together by magic, they must work as one to navigate the kingdom of theatre, unravel its secrets, and face the Shadow King. But before you step onto the stage, here are five essential tips to help you on your journey. 1. Keep Your Eyes Open for Costumes – They’re More Than Just Fashion Throughout the world, you’ll find antique sewing devices, which allow Nieve to craft unique story costumes for Drev. All of the outfits are based on important characters you will meet on your adventure. These costumes make you look cool on stage, but several play a role in the game’s storytelling. Just like in real theatre, a character’s attire is often a clue to their role in the performance. In Once Upon a Puppet, certain challenges will require you to wear a specific costume to progress. There are four of these specific costumes that are linked to the game’s progress, and they are easy to come across. However, there are more actor-like cosmetic outfits to unlock, so be on the lookout for them on your travels! 2. Pick Up Collectibles – They Reveal Hidden Stories As you explore the world, keep an eye out for two types of collectibles: Stained Glass Pieces and Props. The Stained Glass collectibles are broken glass shards of bigger “stained colored glass windows”. Each of these “glass windows” tells a visual story of the kingdom. The Props are personal items of the lead characters in the game, such as The Queen, The King, and The Judge. These personal items always have something interesting to reveal about their owner. Collecting all of these will enhance your understanding of the world. If you’re someone who loves immersive storytelling, make sure to search every corner for these hidden gems! 3. Don’t Skip Cutscenes – They Hold Vital Clues Each cutscene in Once Upon a Puppet is carefully crafted to deliver not just an emotional impact but also crucial hints about the world and the challenges ahead. The game features 12 rebuilding stages, and your goal is to rebuild and re-enact key moments from the king’s past. Every stage has its own unique story and emotional weight, so watching closely will help you connect the dots and fully grasp the significance of your journey. If you rush through without paying attention to the cutscenes, you will miss important details about the mysteries behind the Shadow King, the forgotten stories, and the characters’ true destinies. So sit back, enjoy the theatrical storytelling, and let the narrative unfold like a grand stage performance! 4. Experiment with Stage Manipulation – Think Like a Theatre Director One of the most unique mechanics in Once Upon a Puppet is the ability to rebuild and rearrange theatrical stages. Unlike traditional platformers, where the world remains static, this game allows you to move props, shift backdrops, and reposition platforms to change the scene itself. Some puzzles require you to think like a stage director, setting up the scene in a way that allows Nieve and Drev to progress. Moving elements strategically can uncover secret paths, activate mechanisms, or create opportunities to outmanoeuvre enemies. Once you “set the stage”, a Theatrical Cutscene, connected to the stage you just set, will emerge. 5.  Spotlights aren’t just for drama In Once Upon a Puppet, the rules of theatre guide every ray of light. The visual language of the game was built with the same care and discipline found in real stage productions. There are no accidental shadows or randomly placed beams—every light angle, silhouette, and contrast exists to serve the story, emotion, and staging. This isn’t just lighting for aesthetics—it’s lighting with intention, rooted in the traditions of live theatre. A love letter to stagecraft, told through pixels and puppets. And quite possibly, a guide to secrets to discover. We hope that with these tips in mind, you’ll be well-prepared to take center stage and face the challenges that await. We can’t wait for you to experience the magic firsthand. Once Upon a Puppet is out now on Xbox series X|S. Good luck!
