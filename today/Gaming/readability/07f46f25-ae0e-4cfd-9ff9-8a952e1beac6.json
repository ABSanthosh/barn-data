  "text": "There were actually three play tests last week for Stars Reach, though I missed the first two as they were on Tuesday, when my wife and I went to the movies, and Thursday, which was Halloween and we were hanging out with the neighbors.  But that is okay, because Saturday was the big event.  The previous two were testing fixes, while the third introduced new stuff. Stars Reach I showed up early, as did a pack of testers, because there was some talk about gating people joining the test, and I wasn’t keen to spend time waiting around.  As such, some of us got into the game before the designated hour. We started out on a new planet that was a 1km by 1km grid, with a base setup where we dropped in. The starting base The idea was to have a progression more akin to what the game may be like eventually, so while some tools were available to us right away, but some abilities and items, like the The skill trees for the test That skill tree sample (which was from the F1 help display during the test), and you may need to click on it to read the items, shows items as trained that were not trained when we went in. (Also, I had no skills to unlock under Botany at all, so those may be yet to come.) So there were choices to be made, and I suspect I chose poorly.  For 400 points in survey you could get the map OR you could get the recipes for the grapple and the grav mesh, both of which are very useful. Survey tree unlocks I chose to get the map when I made it to 400 points, because I love maps and figured it would help me find the rest of the survey points.  The first 30 or so are easy to find, just out there in the open and flashing at you when you have the survey tool equipped. Obvious survey point is obvious But after a while they become much more elusive and a square kilometer with hills and cliffs and ravines gives them plenty of places to hide.  At least there were none in a lava field this time around. I did find it a little bit odd that the survey tool only registered the nodes on mouse up… you could get close enough, click the mouse button down to register the node, but nothing happens until you release the mouse button.  Only then does it turn green.  It is a tiny thing, but there is no user feedback on success while you’re actively pressing the mouse button, which you could hold down for an hour without seeing anything update.  Oh well. Anyway, in choosing the map I ended up being able to find some that really needed the grapple or the grav mesh (the anti-gravity flying device) to get to.  And, because I couldn’t get to them, I couldn’t earn the survey points needed to earn those recipes.  With 64 survey points I was only ever going to be able to unlock one unless I just kept setting waypoints, which earned you 1 survey point per placement.  I was using my waypoint as a navigational beacon. And I am not sure unlocking the recipes would have been much help in any case, as I found it very difficult to gather resources in any case.  I succeeded in not crafting anything as I could never assemble the needed items during the 2 hour window… and there were quite a few resources that could be gathered. The resource list for crafting There was also a grid of recipes in the help files. The recipe matrix I have never once come upon a gemstone in any of the tests so far, so perhaps the map was the right choice, because I came up empty again on that front so I was never going to get the grav mesh anyway. So the part of the test on the planet was pretty much an incremental step forward from past tests.  The promo piece that Playable Worlds put out billed this as the start of “multiworld” testing, but unless you stretch that word out of shape, there was one 1km square world.  There may be multiple worlds, or different worlds coming, but today it was really just the one world. Well, the one world, plus space, but I’ll get to space in a minute. This was a new world for us, with new terrain to explore.  Or new-ish.  There was a corner of it that looked just like the test world we had been on before.  But there were new places to go and new terrain challenges to deal with… and no lava… or at least no lava that we didn’t manifest with a heat ray. For example, there were some major ravines through the world that, once you got into, were tough to get out of if you had spent your survey points on a map. There is no climbing up that wall But with the terraformer tool I was able to burn a ramp into the wall so that I could walk/climb out.  I saw a number of such ramps carved into the side of various points in the canyon as the test went on. Modifying the world to meet my needs The tools were updated, had new models in some cases, and some new or easier to access abilities. Trailblazer and Pathfinder tools tip That was where I spent most of my time during the test, on the planet chasing down survey points or fruitlessly sifting for resources.  There was some talk by the devs about the ability to identify resources via a tool at some future date.  But for now it was luck and persistence and, honestly, once again, with a limited amount of time to test, I didn’t want to spend it digging holes.  That feels more like an activity when we get a test server that persists for a few days or a week and I can spend an evening doing that. Though, when digging holes, the terraformer tool now doesn’t just magically eradicate matter, it collects it in a hopper which you must empty every so often.  An increased size hopper is one of the things you can unlock.  And, when you empty the hopper, the tailings are dumped in piles on the landscape, so it is a zero sum game. And, of course, a lot of the usual things happened on the ground.  It isn’t a Stars Reach test run if somebody isn’t messing around with the water, boiling it, freezing it, or draining it off somewhere. Another tower of boiling water… But lets talk about space, which was the fun new thing added to this play test. When we dropped into the world there was a portal not too far from the starting base. Behold, the portal If you found the portal, realized it was a portal, and activated it in the first few minutes we were in the test, you got to go to space.  Unfortunately, the devs had setup some sort of gating system between the world and space and the ability to get into the game which meant they needed to close off the portal for about an hour during the play test. That meant, during that hour, three people got to enjoy space.  Space was also where gems were plentiful, or so we were told.  So, again, tough options for crafting.  And I get that we’re past the point of handing players things, but again, with a timer running down you kind of have to decide what you’re going to do. On the planet people piled in and the lag got very noticeable when we were past the 100 player mark.  This led to a discussion of, among other things, places where players collect, with Jita from EVE Online being brought in as an example (for the maybe five of us who had played the game extensively), which is the single most active system in New Eden and its premier trade hub, and how Stars Reach was going to handle the propensity for players to congregate. That didn’t get a direct answer, but rather some talk about being able to spin up adjacent zones/worlds to keep people spread out and the overall undesirability of seamless worlds where players can congregate and the need to solve the emergent issue of crowding through things like layering and phasing. So I guess the answer was that if the lag is bad you’ll feel encouraged to go elsewhere and that trade hubs will have to be dispersed… though there is also a desire to have no magical transport system… no in-game mailing to yourself, no bank that has your stuff where ever you go, and no universal auction house… as well as the need to transport goods, which sounds like the situation in EVE Online that led to Jita being the central trade hub, so I feel like there is some work to be done still on figuring that out.  Players looking for a central location to trade has always come up and will continue to do so.  Back in TorilMUD in the 90s when there wasn’t a market we created one by yelling in Waterdeep.  In EverQuest in 1999 we quickly began to congregate at the Commonlands tunnel. The Plane of Knowledge kills all this soon enough All of which makes me want to go back to an old post where I tried to map market friction and whether not the economy was required or optional. My view back in 2013 In EVE Online you pretty much have to engage with the economy beyond the basic starter missions and friction is high because even when you can buy something remotely, you still need to go to the place where it was listed in order to pick it up. (Or, as with the great Tenerifis migration, pay somebody to haul it for you.) Anyway, space. After a lot of time had passed and people who had been locked out of the test waiting for access had wandered off and people who crashed and could not get back in called it a day, we were asked to congregate around the portal because the devs were finally going to let some more people into space. Crowd around the portal The reddish tint on the ground is due to all the flares being set off, that being one of the things you could unlock, to help people find the portal.   I had, for quite a while, been trying to stay within easy distance of the portal in the hope that we might be given the opportunity to go through. One of the caveats of the portal, we were told before it opened, was a high likelihood that the client would crash on use.  But many were willing to take the risk, and so the portal was opened.  I got through on the first try, no crash. I am in space… you can tell, I have a helmet now! Space was a very new and different experience.  As on the world, we started in a base where gravity pulled us to the floor on arrival.  Out on the platform around the base asteroids were visible.  While I had not built, and sorely missed, the grav mesh on the main world, out in space you could jump/fly as with the grav mesh. Going to explore some asteroids I suspect that this is another situation where we’re skipped quite a bit of planned progress that will appear later in an effort to get us to try something new. And gravity itself… was relative to your position.  Each asteroid generated its own gravitational pull from its center, which meant that you could take a stroll around its exterior, down always being at your feet, while the rest of what you could see moved/rotated relative to your own perspective. The base is now on its side as I have hopped from an asteroid The base itself was an example of relative gravity and perspective, as the base itself was on one side of the platform while the portal back to the world was on the other side. Now it is portal side up! Gravity could still be a bit fickle, even on one side or the other of the platform.  I had multiple occasions where myself or somebody else was walking on the walls of the ceiling of the base. At right angles to my reality It was actually kind of tough to get a decent screen shot of that however, as at this point in development the camera clips through objects and terrain with wild abandon, which means zooming out to frame a shot often ended up with the camera outside the building. This was also a problem with mining anywhere as the camera tended to just pull in what it wants, seemingly more so than in past tests. The camera clipping getting out of hand That and the character model getting stuck or unable to decide where you’re actually standing, leaving your character vibrating between positions and fairly uncontrollable are issues to be tackled still. And the fact that the gravity on an asteroid was pulling you towards its center added a new dimension to that.  Also, the three people who got in there early had been busy mining away as there were big holes and labyrinths of tunnels in the larger rocks out there. That’s no moon! As mentioned, the tailings from all of that mining had to go somewhere, so there were piles on the surface, though one person got creative with the hopper and piled theirs into a tower. Does that have an effect on orbital eccentricity? But all was not peace and quiet in space.  The mobs from the surface followed us into space and were there to pounce on the unwary. Shouldn’t you be a “spaceshark” or have a helmet or something? While I had avoided the mobs on the planet fairly handily… they didn’t seem to be out in such large groups… in space they seemed to be lurking over the horizon on several of the asteroids, and the horizon on an asteroid it very close. This is not going to end well So I died a few times in space… though nobody could hear me scream mostly because I keep my mic muted on Discord during these tests. But, since last time I was in a test, the devs had added a red waypoint marker to help you find your corpse.  Previously it had been something of a “1999 EverQuest” sort of effort to get back to your stuff… and when you die, your inventory stays with your body… so at least now we had something to guide us. Getting back to where my stuff landed Space was pretty nifty.  At some point in the future of the game there will be also sorts of things to construct that will be space specific, but just flitting around on some asteroids and mining a bit was pretty cool.  Space was also pretty, but as an EVE Online player you pretty much have to be dedicated to that as an idea. A space vista At one point I decided to head back down to the planet, possibly with a mind to get the last eight waypoints I was missing to finish the 64 needed to complete the planet survey, so I went to the portal side of the base. The space side of the portal connection You can see that people dropped camps around the portal, though the holes in the platform seemed to mean that the work stations didn’t apply. On the way back I hit the portal crash.  Oh well. Space crash! The game was still open to let people in, so I was able to jump back in on the planet again to try and finish up my one goal. That meant crossing some terrain which, without the grav mesh, made for some effort. Have to cross the ravine without flying The planet had its own charm and I managed to get to 59 of 64 of the survey points. That one is literally by the portal where I was earlier But I did not make my goal.  I ended up with a pair at the top of a tall precipice that was too high to climb with my stamina limit and we were down to the last few minutes of the test, so I called it.  I saw four or five people get announced as having logged all of the survey points, so it was doable.  I spent too much of my time on other tasks. So on the upside of the whole thing, the larger world was interesting and better looking and space looks like it has a lot of potential.  Crashes are, of course, annoying.  But, as always, this is pre-Alpha testing where things change, sometimes dramatically, between tests. Looking towards space I look forward to a time when things have settle enough for people to be able to spend a weekend digging into things.  But a two hour time box with testers on voice coms so you can drive or direct them places gets things done for now.

cliffs and ravines gives them plenty of places to hide.  At least there were none in a lava field this time around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did find it a little bit odd that the survey tool only registered the nodes on mouse up… you could get close enough, click the mouse button down to register the node, but nothing happens until you release the mouse button.  Only then does it turn green.  It is a tiny thing, but there is no user feedback on success while you’re actively pressing the mouse button, which you could hold down for an hour without seeing anything update.  Oh well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, in choosing the map I ended up being able to find some that really needed the grapple or the grav mesh (the anti-gravity flying device) to get to.  And, because I couldn’t get to them, I couldn’t earn the survey points needed to earn those recipes.  With 64 survey points I was only ever going to be able to unlock one unless I just kept setting waypoints, which earned you 1 survey point per placement.  I was using my waypoint as a navigational beacon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I am not sure unlocking the recipes would have been much help in any case, as I found it very difficult to gather resources in any case.  I succeeded in not crafting anything as I could never assemble the needed items during the 2 hour window… and there were quite a few resources that could be gathered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_124433\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

down survey points or fruitlessly sifting for resources.  There was some talk by the devs about the ability to identify resources via a tool at some future date.  But for now it was luck and persistence and, honestly, once again, with a limited amount of time to test, I didn’t want to spend it digging holes.  That feels more like an activity when we get a test server that persists for a few days or a week and I can spend an evening doing that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough, when digging holes, the terraformer tool now doesn’t just magically eradicate matter, it collects it in a hopper which you must empty every so often.  An increased size hopper is one of the things you can unlock.  And, when you empty the hopper, the tailings are dumped in piles on the landscape, so it is a zero sum game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, of course, a lot of the usual things happened on the ground.  It isn’t a Stars Reach test run if somebody isn’t messing around with the water, boiling it, freezing it, or draining it off somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_124445\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

id=\"caption-attachment-124436\"\u003eBehold, the portal\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you found the portal, realized it was a portal, and activated it in the first few minutes we were in the test, you got to go to space.  Unfortunately, the devs had setup some sort of gating system between the world and space and the ability to get into the game which meant they needed to close off the portal for about an hour during the play test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat meant, during that hour, three people got to enjoy space.  Space was also where gems were plentiful, or so we were told.  So, again, tough options for crafting.  And I get that we’re past the point of handing players things, but again, with a timer running down you kind of have to decide what you’re going to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the planet people piled in and the lag got very noticeable when we were past the 100 player mark.  This led to a discussion of, among other things, places where players collect, with Jita from \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e being brought in as an example (for the maybe five of us who had played the game extensively), which is the single most active system in New Eden and its premier trade hub, and how \u003cem\u003eStars Reach\u003c/em\u003e was going to handle the propensity for players to congregate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat didn’t get a direct answer, but rather some talk about being able to spin up adjacent zones/worlds to keep people spread out and the overall undesirability of seamless worlds where players can congregate and the need to solve the emergent issue of crowding through things like layering and phasing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I guess the answer was that if the lag is bad you’ll feel encouraged to go elsewhere and that trade hubs will have to be dispersed… though there is also a desire to have no magical transport system… no in-game mailing to yourself, no bank that has your stuff where ever you go, and no universal auction house… as well as the need to transport goods, which sounds like the situation in \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e that led to Jita being the central trade hub, so I feel like there is some work to be done still on figuring that out.  Players looking for a central location to trade has always come up and will continue to do so.  Back in \u003cem\u003eTorilMUD\u003c/em\u003e in the 90s when there wasn’t a market we created one by \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2017/10/27/selling-in-waterdeep/\"\u003eyelling in

of a tall precipice that was too high to climb with my stamina limit and we were down to the last few minutes of the test, so I called it.  I saw four or five people get announced as having logged all of the survey points, so it was doable.  I spent too much of my time on other tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo on the upside of the whole thing, the larger world was interesting and better looking and space looks like it has a lot of potential.  Crashes are, of course, annoying.  But, as always, this is pre-Alpha testing where things change, sometimes dramatically, between tests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_124497\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca
