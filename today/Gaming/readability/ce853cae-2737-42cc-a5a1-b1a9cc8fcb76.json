However, the news isn‚Äôt going over so well, as fans now realize how far off the film actually is. While Sony may be driving its Spider-Man supervillain film universe straight off a cliff into a lake of acid, the Spider-Verse films are riding high. The announcement that Persichetti and Thompson are directing should be a positive one, as each has been an integral part of the trilogy so far, having sat in the co-director‚Äôs seat for at least one film. However, fans, who have been clamoring for any information on the movie after the cliffhanger ending of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, were not pleased. direct??? the movie was supposed to RELEASE like 8 months ago and its not even directed yet üò≠üò≠üò≠ we aint seeing this till 2027 üôè‚Äî P–µQu (@ImPeQu) December 17, 2024 The film was originally scheduled to release this past March as a quick follow-up to the second film but was scrubbed from Sony‚Äôs release schedule with no reason given. Fans thought today‚Äôs announcement would be a new release date, but, instead, it was a set of directors, a fact that hints at the film being a long, long way off. As one X user noted, ‚ÄúThis feels like an announcement you make before you start doing a film.‚Äù Others were just as shocked and upset.
