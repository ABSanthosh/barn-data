  "text": "Hello, our tiny No Man’s Sky team has a Halloween treat for our PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation VR players. Our last update saw players enjoying a nice chill time, as we added fishing to No Man’s Sky. Our next update couldn’t be more different. As we approach Halloween, we want to scare and surprise players, and The Cursed is an unexpectedly creepy update for No Man’s Sky. The Cursed is a weird and unsettling gameplay event, where you’ll fight to keep a grip on reality while haunted by visions and voices from another dimension. Taking place in a sort of twilight universe, The Cursed straddles the boundary between one reality and the next. Here, time can shift unexpectedly, spinning from day to night at a vertigo-inducing rate. The new Boundary Herald Starship is your safe haven in this haunted universe. Our first flying saucer, is a gorgeous Giger-esque coil of tubes, pipeworks, and engines. Players must protect themselves against the weakening of the boundaries of reality. Your exosuit comes fitted with a specialized Anomaly Suppressor – maintaining this is the key to surviving while the universe begins to break down around you. As players struggle to navigate these haunted worlds, they may come face to face with the ghostly beings that drift across the boundaries. Sometimes these spectral anomalies merely observe, and sometimes they can turn much more hostile. These encounters provide players with new challenging enemies and boss battles, at a scale not seen before in No Man’s Sky. Travellers will not have access to hyperdrive technology, meaning no warping between star systems. Instead, interstellar travel requires careful planning and use of the ancient portal network. Haunting voices, leaking through from another dimension, will provide guidance, information, strange blueprints,and mystery. It is up to you to decide who these voices belong to, where they are coming from, and if they are to be trusted. The Cursed brings with it a host of exclusive spooky rewards, including a Cthulhu-esque Horror Exosuit customization, bioluminescent pets, and the ultimate reward, retrieved from the reality collapse, the UFO-like Boundary Herald Starship. Travel beyond the boundaries and fortify your mind against spectral anomalies – or succumb to the call of the world of glass. The expedition begins today, free for existing PlayStation players and will run for approximately two weeks.  Our last update Aquarius, brought fishing to No Man’s Sky and proved very popular. For us, 2024 continues to be one of our most popular years since launch. In the coming weeks, we have several more surprises, including a specific release to take advantage of the incredible power of the PlayStation 5 Pro at launch. Our journey continues.
