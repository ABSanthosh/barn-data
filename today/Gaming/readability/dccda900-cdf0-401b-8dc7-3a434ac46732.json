  "text": "I am going to suggest that it is a bit of an open question as to whether or not a longer Kickstarter campaign, whether going a full 30 days, is better than something shorter. Stars Reach is coming The argument in favor of a longer campaign is easy.  The more time people have to find out about it and join in, the better.  You never know when some interview or headline is going to land just right and bring out a host of people who only just learned that your campaign and product were even a thing. The argument in favor of a shorter campaign requires you to acknowledge the likely reality that, if you’ve done your job right and rallied your followers and potential audience ahead of time… because if you haven’t done then you’re bad at this, there being no benefit to a “surprise” campaign… then you will have backers lined up and pledging and will at least come close to success within the first 48 hours. My long standing rule is that any campaign that doesn’t hit the half way mark in those first two days has failed in some way… mostly by not doing the work up front to generate interest and build up an interested base of users… and is unlikely to succeed. They are not doomed to failure, and some campaigns pull it out in the end, like One Billion Users, a table top card game that failed to get to the 20% mark in the first 48 hours, but managed to win in the end due to the sheer force of will that required the team getting out on social media to promote the title to their followers.  Ironically, the game is about building a social media platform and gaining users.  I backed that campaign. And even Star Citizen took a little longer to get to the 50% mark, though that was in the early days of Kickstarter when it was a strange new thing and people were not what it was or how campaigns worked. But for the most part campaigns follow a similar pattern and any campaign sitting at 15% of their goal half way through their 30 days is as good as failed without some super special emergency backup plan… and if you had that why wouldn’t you have just gone with that in the first place. The pattern is the U-shaped campaign, where there is an initial rush in the first 48 hours as the dedicated followers pile in and pledge.  Again, if you’ve done your pre-campaign work well, this is your big win.  In the case of Stars Reach, it also helped that they picked a pretty low campaign goal, something they managed to double in the first 48 hours. I do wonder if that low number will hurt them a bit on the other side.  Having met their goal, there is now no sense of urgency.  They’ve won and everything else is just running up the score.  But that is something to explore later. The other big spike in any campaign tends to come at the end when those who were sitting on the fence as undecided finally succumb to FOMO and jump in. Camelot Unchained is a good example of the U-shaped campaign, looking at its numbers over on Kicktraq. The CU campaign a dozen years back You can see the big initial surge as those who believe in Mark Jacobs bought in on the swindle plan.  Then there was the surge at the end, which was especially dramatic as Mark had bet on a $2 million campaign goal, which he just barely made, landing at $2.2 million at the buzzer.  It was not at all in the bag until the last 24 hours. Then there is the middle part… where not may people bid.  On some slower campaigns you can even get a negative day as people feel some buyers remorse and retract their pledge or lower their commitment. So the question for me is whether those low number days in the middle… if they were worth it.  How many of those were people who just learned about the whole thing?  Because Mark Jacobs was out there giving interviews, talking about stretch goals, putting out more statements and artwork and visions about the intent of the campaign that whole time.   Granted, there wasn’t much room for stretch goals in the end, but he and his team didn’t just nap the whole time between the first and final 24 hours, they were out there working the room. And sure, those middle days add up and were really needed in the case of Camelot Unchained.  But how many of those would they have gotten either way if the campaign had been 20 days or even 10 days?  The longer campaign argument has a point of diminishing returns or people would go with 60, or 90, or 365 day long campaigns.  I mean, Kickstarter itself now limits campaigns to 60 days as they say longer campaigns rarely succeed.  But if longer was better, you bet they would allow them. So I feel like campaigns default to 30 days… you can make them between 1 and 60 days, it is your choice… because that kind of sounds good and they worry about people not hearing about the campaign until it has been in progress for a while.  And it is hard to argue with that, but I suspect Kickstarter holds data that would validate or disprove that assumption. There is the possibility that saying that you raised a million dollars in 15 days might sound better to investors that $1.2 million in 30 days.  Maybe?  Or would the investor just suggest the campaign should have gone longer? Anyway, well run campaigns are front loaded with backers and tend to get a lot of last minute people jumping on the bandwagon in the final 24 hours.  Then, during the middle, they need to figure out what they are about, what they need to do. Which brings me, after a lot of chatter, back around to the Stars Reach campaign, which has gotten through the initial burst of excitement, met their rather modest $200K goal, and have now entered the mid-campaign doldrums.  Over at Kicktraq you can see the daily pledges shrinking down to a much lower level after the first 48 hours. The Stars Reach campaign daily activity so far So it is on the team to stir up some excitement in order to keep those mid-campaign days from sagging even further.  And the team has been out there doing interviews and putting up new content on Twitch and going over the new races unlocked via stretch goals.  They even threw in a new pledge tier, the Solo Smuggler package. Become the Solo Smuggler For $1,050 you get all the Forever Traveler perks, including the lifetime property pass, along with some spaceship things. And here is a place where I think the team could earn some attention, by giving fans a bit more information on the spaceship front. As I have noted a number of times, what we see right now, what we can play, what the team talks about in detail, is a viable but still very raw planetary focused base building survival title.  The team mentions spaceships and space exploration and smuggling, but always in a hand-wavy way that doesn’t really give the listener much to hang onto. I actually got a bit excited when I saw the image that came with the Solo Smuggler announcement… until I realized that WAS NOT a spaceship, but just something a player put together with the in-game base building materials. This is not a spaceship, calm down So, as the team went with the predictable game plan for a 30 day campaign, it feels like they are also going to stick to a very conservative plan of only speaking in any detail about what players can experience today in the pre-alpha play test.  Any game mechanics upcoming are only mentioned in very vague ways. Your spaceship secrets! And who am I to say what is the right plan?  It isn’t my company on the line. But it also feels like they need something boost the mid-campaign and help get the whole thing over the million dollar mark, which feels like a line they will need to cross to be taken seriously by investors.  It is cool they made $200K in less than an hour, but the campaign is 30 days long and look at all the titles that made two million dollars in that time frame.  If you can’t make a million in the same time, what does that say? I am not saying that they need to go full on Chris Roberts, but the man could sell a vision. We shall see.  One other thing that Chris Roberts taught us is that you don’t have to stop campaigning at the end of the Kickstarter.  Cloud Imperium is closing in on $800 million in crowdfunding. While I am not suggesting that path, the team could continue to make these packages available… at a slightly higher price… after the campaign and count them towards the total. We shall see.  The campaign carries on.

the listener much to hang onto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI actually got a bit excited when I saw the image that came with the Solo Smuggler announcement… until I realized that WAS NOT a spaceship,
