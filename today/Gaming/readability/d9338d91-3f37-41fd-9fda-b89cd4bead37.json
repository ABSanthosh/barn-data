  "text": "Rocksteady Studios’ Suicide Squad game is officially coming to its end. The fourth season of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will welcome a new playable character, Deathstroke, to the game, and “will mark the final battle against Brainiac,” the developer said Monday on the game’s official website.Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s next update will also bring with it the game’s long-promised offline mode, though Rocksteady and publisher Warner Bros. say that “all online features will continue to be available” for the cooperative shooter.Season 4 of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will launch on Dec. 10, with Deathstroke, offline mode, and Episode 7 of the game’s story. Episode 8, the game’s conclusion, will arrive on Jan. 14, 2025 and feature the final battle against Brainiac, whom Suicide Squad players have been battling in various multiversal forms over the past year.Deathstroke will be the fourth post-launch character released for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, following The Joker, Mrs. Freeze, and Lawless. Rocksteady and Warner Bros. never announced additional characters beyond those four, though early leaks from datamining indicated that Rocksteady was considering releasing DC villains Katana and Killer Croc as playable characters.Offline mode for Kill the Justice League will let players experience the main story campaign and seasonal story mission content without the need for an internet connection. The game has thus far required that players be online, an early point of contention for players. Offline mode will require that players either create a new profile by starting from the beginning of the game or creating a copy of their existing profile to retain their progress.Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League launched in February to middling reviews and a cool commercial reception. Warner Bros. Discovery boss David Zaslav called the game “disappointing,” saying that Rocksteady’s game was partly responsible for a “$200 million impact” on the company’s games division’s earnings. Reception to the game’s DLC hasn’t fared much better. Suicide Squad has since been given away and heavily discounted.Rocksteady’s take on the Suicide Squad was a lightning rod for controversy, based on its tone, games-as-a-service leanings, and treatment of the Arkhamverse heroes like Batman. But after dramatically killing the likes of Superman, The Flash, and Green Lantern, Kill the Justice League started to bring back its once-dead heroes, pulling them in from various Elseworlds. Some story threads are still unresolved, but perhaps the fourth and final season will give players the closure they need.",
