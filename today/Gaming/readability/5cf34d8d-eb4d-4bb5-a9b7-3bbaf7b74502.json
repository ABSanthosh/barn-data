The thing is, the Reddit recap that is available… isn’t as good as it used to be.  I posted about my Reddit recap in 2021 and 2022 when they were going more in depth for users.  Now it feels a bit more superficial… and you can only get your recap on the mobile app and it took me a while to find it and, once there, I cannot get back.  So it feels like Reddit isn’t into the whole thing as much as they once were.  No count for karma, total posts, comments, or such, just bananas.  The basic metric remains the number of banana lengths one has scrolled. Reddit 2024 – My Bananas That is considerably less than 2022, where it was 35K bananas.  Not sure why, but there it is.  It is certainly possible it is only tracking in the app now and not in the web UI. Of course, it indicates that my most popular community is r/eve.  That was a given.  My most popular post and comment were in that subreddit.  The post was just a matter of me being first to post the July 2024 Director’s Letter where CCP… honestly, fed us a bunch of garbage about the Equinox expansion so far.  I have linked back to that post, and the top comment under that post, a few times this year. You can also get some stats for each subreddit, so you can see what the top three posts in r/eve were, though the metric used to determine that… upvotes, comments, views, scrolls, something else… is left unstated. r/eve top three posts I wrote a post here anchored the first one, the open letter, and am certain I linked out to the third. My most popular comment was a bit of perspective on the whole EVE Frontier thing, the hope that maybe all that dirty crypto money would do more than siphon off experienced devs from EVE Online, that it would maybe build some functionality that would help CCP’s core game.  That is, admittedly, a faint hope, but sometimes that is all you get. There were some other amusing bits out of the recap stuff, like the top comments for r/MMORPG, a toxic swamp of some notoriety. Clear that the first post is on point… However, aside from the fact that I joined r/CAStateWorkers… such a whiny subreddit… or kept visiting but never joined r/NoMansSkyTheGame, there wasn’t much to really talk about. But then there were achievements.  Back in April Reddit added achievements to the site and seemed to really start pushing them in October/November.  Some of them are retroactive, some of them are not and some of them are just wrong. Some of the general achievements I guess I did sign up for Reddit back in 2011.  It was probably to follow more closely the events unfolding around the Incarana expansion and the trash fire that became. On the other hand, the Elder achievement says I did not join r/eve until March 2021, which seems pretty unlikely.  Maybe I accidentally clicked the button to leave and rejoin?  I don’t know, but that cannot be right. The community achievements I have are all for r/eve.  I don’t think I comment, much lest post, on any other subreddit. Community Building Achievements I am a bit surprised to get into the top commenter category… in r/eve of course.  It feels like a lot of people comment a lot more persistently than I do.  Then again, the recap stats for the subreddit say that almost 1.9 million people visited in 2024, so I guess I just have to be ahead of 10K people to be in the top 5%. I am unlikely to get into the top 25% of posters because I am pretty judicious about starting new threads.  I check to see if there is already one on the topic I am there for and generally stick with that if it is at all on point. Where I do seem to be on fire with achievements is the daily streak.  I am past the 150 day achievement at this point. Counting up the days This is largely due to the fact that Reddit somehow became part of my morning routine.  I waked up, pick up the iPad, check mail, do the Wordle, and look at what is new in r/eve.  Since CCP is at UTC for a time zone, I can generally get a heads up on what has been announced for the day by looking to see what r/eve is complaining about first thing in the morning. We’ll see how long that keeps up.  I do it pretty much automatically.  But the second my morning routine is subject to change, the streak might end.  I may never get to the 500 day “Basement Dweller” achievement, but we shall see. Finally, somebody has already written a guide to getting all of the achievements, if that is your thing.  I will stick to the more accidental approach.",

\u003cem\u003eIncarana\u003c/em\u003e expansion and the trash fire that became.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, the Elder achievement says I did not join r/eve until March 2021, which seems pretty unlikely.  Maybe I accidentally clicked the button to leave and rejoin?  I don’t know, but that cannot be right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe community achievements I have are all for r/eve.  I don’t think I comment, much lest post, on any other subreddit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_126135\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

feels like a lot of people comment a lot more persistently than I do.  Then again, the recap stats for the subreddit say that almost 1.9 million people visited in 2024, so I guess I just have to be ahead of 10K people to be in the top 5%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am unlikely to get into the top 25% of posters because I am pretty judicious about starting new threads.  I check to see if there is already one on the topic I am there for and generally stick with that if it is at all on point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere I do seem to be on fire with achievements is the daily streak.  I

up, pick up the iPad, check mail, do the Wordle, and look at what is new in r/eve.  Since CCP is at UTC for a time zone, I can generally get a heads up on what has been announced for the day by looking to see what r/eve is complaining about first thing in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ll see how long that keeps up.  I do it pretty much automatically.  But the second my morning routine is subject to change, the streak might end.  I may never get to the 500 day “Basement Dweller” achievement, but we shall see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, somebody has already \u003ca
