We’ve launched a survey in hopes of getting some feedback on where we are and where we’re going. You can find that survey by clicking here. The 15-question survey is designed to help us make Escapist bigger and better than ever by listening to what our community thinks we’d benefit most from. This is your opportunity to help us shape Escapist and make your voice heard. We’d also love to get to know and what you love more. The survey should only take around 5-10 minutes, and we’d really appreciate your help. Regardless of if you do or not, thank you so much for reading Escapist.
