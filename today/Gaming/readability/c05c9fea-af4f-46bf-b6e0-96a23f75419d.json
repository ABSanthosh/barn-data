  "description": "Are you eager to solve the Mystery Gate riddles in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers? These strange doorways are found in specific locations, and they present a rather perplexing question. Only one answer is correct, though picking a wrong choice might be beneficial in the long run, too. Our guide has all the details, but be forewarned that there are spoilers ahead.All Mystery Gates in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers - Riddles and correct answers guideThere are three Mystery Gates in the game. They're found in Tang Palace, Hillswatch, and Bo Capital. If you answer all three correctly, you'll receive the \"Sage\" achievement. However, there are times when you might need to give the wrong answer if you want to obtain other goodies.Note 1: When you pick an answer, the doorway will open and you won't be able to interact with it again. You have to proceed to New Game Plus after beating the campaign if you want to pick a different answer. Alternatively, you can keep a backup save. For PC players, you can find your \"Saved\" folder in \"C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Local\\Project_Plague.\"Note 2: There's a point of no return just past the Mt. Zhenwu - Zhenwu Altar shrine. A certain NPC will even warn you if you wish to proceed further. If you press onward, the Mystery Gates in Tang Palace and Hillswatch will disappear. Mystery Gate #1: Tang PalaceLocation: Palace Pass (Worship's Rise) - This is the first Wuchang: Fallen Feathers Mystery Gate that you'll come across, and it's fairly hard to miss. Just continue along the left-hand side of the palace complex. Eventually, you'll see this doorway just before the Tang Palace Maid boss fight. Mystery Gate #1: Riddle and correct answerRiddle: \"In Shu's tranquil retreat, divine shards we behold. Can we seize the threads of fate or the eternal flow of life?\"Correct answer: \"The winged ascension.\" Reward: Benediction Sheng - Lasting AlacrityIncorrect answer: \"Feathered transcendence.\" Reward: You'll be teleported to the opposite side of the courtyard. You can defeat an enemy here and collect some materials/Red Mercury resources. The Boatman NPC is also here and you can chat with him for additional resources.The Boatman is a key supporting character and your interactions with him in Ferry Overlook reward you with a unique weapon. If you're unable to chat with him here, then he might not appear later on. Mystery Gate #2: HillswatchLocation: Hillswatch (Cloudspire) - The second Wuchang: Fallen Feathers riddle is near the area with the shrine. It's actually to the right once you get off the elevator from the Reverent Temple caves. Mystery Gate #2: Riddle and correct answerRiddle: \"Delusion grips, conviction burns; greed and folly take their turns. Breathless wails pierce through the night; lifeless forms devoid of light.\"Correct answer: \"Challenge the threads of fate.\" Reward: Leads to a secret area in the caverns that has the Bridal armor set.Incorrect answer: \"Follow the course of destiny.\" Reward: Teleports you to Mort Grotto where you can find a Red Mercury item.The choice here is pretty obvious. Do not pick the wrong answer here since you can still reach Mort Grotto normally as you explore the region. Mystery Gate #3: Bo CapitalLocation: Depths of the Capital (Bo Capital) - Reaching this particular Wuchang: Fallen Feathers Mystery Gate can be quite taxing. Here's a quick summary:From the Capital Entrance shrine, proceed along the path that leads to the upper section of the city.Eventually, you'll reach a narrow pass where several enemies are fighting each other. Ignore them and keep running until you see a pathway to your left.There, you'll see the Depths of the Capital shrine. The gate itself is right next to it.Note 1: Try to keep a backup save before you choose an answer for this riddle.Note 2: There's a large open plaza just beyond this point. The location has a Manna Vase upgrade, though approaching it causes a Giant Bloodbird to swoop in. Mystery Gate #3: Riddle and correct answerRiddle: \"A foolish dream of reunion binds the soul to an eternal existence. Awake from this longing and strife, for the wheel of fate turns beyond our mortal lives.\"Correct answer: \"The grand dream fades.\" Reward: You'll meet the Boatman here and he gives you a Lustrous Red Feather--i.e. upgrade a weapon's mastery to +10 (max level).Incorrect answer: \"The wheel turns anew.\" Reward: This leads to a secret area known as the Shrine Dwelling. It's actually an important location since it's tied to one of the game's endings.As you can see, picking the correct answer for this Wuchang: Fallen Feathers riddle doesn't really reward you with a lot. In fact, the wrong answer here tends to be more important. Still, if you kept a backup save, you can choose the right answer to get the \"Sage\" trophy. Then, load your backup to pick the wrong answer, assuming you're trying to obtain this particular ending, too.That does it for our guide on where to find the Mystery Gates in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers. Speaking of endings and campaign conclusions, you might want to know what you can expect when you continue onward to New Game Plus.Many dangers await you as you venture forth in Sichuan Province during the fall of the Ming Dynasty.
