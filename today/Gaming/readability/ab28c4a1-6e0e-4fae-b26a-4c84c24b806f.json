  "text": "If Letters Had Pants, Would They Wear Them Like This? makes clever use of enhancing pants as you pick out words in the dirt. This game has a lot going on beneath its simple Word Search appearance. Although you will be searching for words as a start. The goal of the game is to locate groups of letters that form a word and to gather them up by highlighting them with your mouse. This can be done in lines or squares, so you’re free to get a little creative with where you see a word. As you create words, they leave open spaces in the field of letters. You can freely ignore these and connect letters that are separated by these spaces, creating words that are spread father apart. It’s not only a good way to clear more of the board, but you get a greater score if the word is spread over a bigger area. If you can get a solid score within the time limit, you’ll be given fabulous roguelite rewards in the form of pants. These pants can be slapped on specific letters so that they offer multipliers on your words, are just worth more in general, or have some wild effects on the game. Pants that let you blow up useless letters are pretty handy in a Word Search gone wild, right? Or you could lean more into the outdoorsy feel of the game and plant turnips instead of explosives. They’re worth points as well. Plus your letters will look good in their new colored pants. Also, If Letters Had Pants, Would They Wear Them Like This? is really about digging for fossils and relics to fill a museum. And the museum can also alter the game. So, like I said, a lot going on. It’s quite the loop, offering something silly, compelling, and creative all at once, and I am finding it increasingly hard to put this game down. If Letters Had Pants, Would They Wear Them Like This? is available now on itch.io. It is projected to release on Steam in the future, so you can add it to your Steam Wishlist as well.
