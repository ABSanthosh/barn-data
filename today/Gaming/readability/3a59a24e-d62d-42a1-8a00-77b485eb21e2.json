  "text": "Dear Trailblazers: On behalf of the Honkai: Star Rail development team, I want to wish you a wonderful New Year! May your journey through the infinite cosmos continue to bring excitement as we embark together on this romantic space adventure. Today, I’m thrilled to share more about Version 3.0 “Paean of Era Nova,” launching January 15. This update introduces the long-awaited world of Amphoreus and begins an epic new chapter in our main story. The Trailblaze Mission in Amphoreus will be released in two parts across eight versions, from 3.0 to 3.7, making it the largest story arc in Honkai: Star Rail to date. Get ready to embark on the “Hero’s Journey” with new playable characters — Aglaea and The Herta, plus the Trailblazer: Remembrance unlocking a new Path! Amphoreus, the Eternal Land Leaving Penacony the Planet of Festivities behind, the Astral Express embarks toward Amphoreus under Black Swan’s guidance, seeking both to replenish Trailblaze Fuel and uncover the mysteries of this celestial body — a realm so enigmatic that even the Aeon of Trailblaze, Akivili, could not reach, its existence hidden from most of the cosmos. From the outside, Amphoreus appears as a chaotic vortex, its existence impossible to detect or understand. Similarly, its inhabitants remain completely unaware of the outside universe. Unlike other worlds, they do not know of the concept of “Aeons,” instead worshiping deities known as “Titans.” According to legend, twelve Titans created Amphoreus: Three who wove fate, three who shaped the heavens and earth, three who molded life, and three who brought calamity.” Yet this realm’s history is steeped in tragedy. In ancient times, the arrival of three Titans — “Strife,” “Death,” and “Trickery” — sparked a civil war among the gods. Soon after, a mysterious force known as the “black tide” swept across the world. None know its origins, but all life touched by it loses sanity, with even the mighty Titans proving vulnerable. Over millennia, between the black tide gradually consuming Amphoreus and the gods waging endless war, the world fell into eternal night. Now, in humanity’s final sanctuary — the Holy City of Okhema — only the protection of Kephale, the Worldbearing Titan, stands as the last barrier against the black tide. And now, the Astral Express, arriving as an unexpected force from beyond this world, is destined to change the course of Amphoreus’s fate, but how? Well, that’s for you to find out, dear Trailblazers! The Beginning of the Hero’s Journey As mentioned earlier, the Trailblaze Mission on Amphoreus will span across eight versions, forming an epic and grand narrative. In the upcoming Version 3.0, you will officially set foot on this eternal land and embark on your own Hero’s Journey. Upon entering Amphoreus, the Trailblazer and Dan Heng first descend into a region known as the “Abyss of Fate.” Legend says three Titans — Time, Passage, and Law — once wove here the threads of time, space, and rules that would govern Amphoreus, determining the fate of all creation. Now this land lies in eternal night, with only emptiness echoing through its grand architectural remains.” As the story unfolds, the Trailblazer’s group will return to the Abyss of Fate, pierce through the mists, delve deep into the temple, and finally gain audience with Oronyx, the Titan of Time. Through this encounter, the Trailblazer embarks on the Path of Remembrance, gaining the ability to “draw strength from the past.” Meanwhile, players will meet a new companion who, due to their mysterious origins and tendency to only make “Mem” sounds, is temporarily named “Mem.” Beyond their adorable appearance, Mem plays a crucial role in combat. The Trailblazer can summon Mem during battles, where it gradually charges Energy. Once fully charged, it provides Mem’s Support that allows a designated character to immediately takes action and deal additional True DMG, turning the tide of battle. Together with Mem, the Trailblazer will surely overcome the various challenges that await in Amphoreus. Following the winding path beyond the Abyss, players will reach Okhema, the Holy City built into the mountainside. Bathed in the eternal dawn light of the Worldbearing Titan’s protection, this city will serve as a crucial base for the trailblazing expedition through Amphoreus. Among its most distinctive landmarks stands the Marmoreal Palace, a grand baths. More than just a place for bathing and relaxation, it functions as the city’s heart, a public gathering space fostering daily social connections among residents. And Okhema has much more to offer beyond its architectural marvels. Here, you’ll encounter a variety of fascinating creatures. Among them is the dromas, a loyal helper of the Amphoreans, known for their strength in carrying both people and goods. The Dromas is a creation of Georios, the Earth Titan, one of the Three Titans of Foundation. A specialized Dromas Workshop can be found within Okhema, dedicated to crafting and training these remarkable creatures. Scattered throughout the city, you’ll also find a host of chimeras, each with its unique traits. Their colors, personalities, and temperaments vary greatly—some are quick to anger, others delight in mischief, and still, others offer their help to humans in whatever way they can. In these times of eternal night and chaos, Okhema, sheltered under the Worldbearing Titan’s protection, remains humanity’s final sanctuary and beacon of hope. Local legend tells a romantic tale: Kephale shall one day open their eyes, leading humanity to triumph over the black tide and forge a new world. From beneath this holy city, a group of human heroes known as the Chrysos Heirs embarks on a quest for flame, shouldering the mission to reclaim the twelve Titan Coreflames and restore Amphoreus to glory. In future stories, the Trailblazer will join their journey, fighting alongside the Chrysos Heirs in this legendary expedition. In Version 3.0, Trailblazers will also explore the unique city-state of Castrum Kremnos. It was named after the Blade of Fury that dangles high above the city, and it is also where the Strife Titan resides, thus making it the place where the seventh Coreflame slumbers. In the second half of the Trailblaze Mission, players will borrow the power of the Oronyx to return to the past and experience Castrum Kremnos during its golden age. There, they will discover one of the mechanisms the Trickery Titan Zagreus left behind: The Hand of Zagreus. This mechanism can be used to lift heavy obtains, pick up items, smash open pathways, and obliterate enemies easily in special circumstances. It serves as a major aid to exploration. In Version 3.0’s climactic Trailblaze Mission, Trailblazers and the Chrysos Heirs will face numerous challenges before engaging in a final battle with Nikador, the Strife Titan, to reclaim the Coreflame of Strife. Known as the “Lance of Fury,” Nikador and its followers hold a fanatical devotion to war and combat. To defeat them, Trailblazers need to collect “Glory” stacks to shatter Nikador’s “Titanic Corpus.” The final area of Version 3.0 unfolds in the Vortex of Genesis, the grand sanctuary and birthplace of Amphoreus. This sacred site, home to the primordial essence of the Twelve Titans, is said to be where the Miracle of Genesis will one day manifest. Here, the Chrysos Heirs will return the reclaimed Coreflames after overthrowing each Titan. Above, constellations light up the night sky, representing the journeys of those who came before. The Flame-Chase Journey, a thousand-year odyssey of trials and perseverance, has now reached its turning point. The road ahead will be forged by the Trailblazers, standing alongside the Chrysos Heirs to continue the legend! Companions of the Flame-Chase Journey Version 3.0 will invite two new and powerful 5-star characters to join the player’s teams. The first is the esteemed#83 member of the Genius Society, an Emanator of Erudition: Madam Herta. Since Herta first debuted, she made a deep impression via her unique Herta puppets and idiosyncratic behaviors on the space station. It is said that her true self resides in a place on the Cosmos’ edge, and she rarely reveals herself to others. It is only today that she has finally shown herself. The Herta is an Ice-Type Erudition character that is skilled at AoE DMG. In battle, she can apply Interpretation on enemies, and ally characters attacks can also further apply Interpretation. With the increase of Interpretation stacks, The Herta’s abilities can increase powerful hits of DMG based on their high Interpretation stacks on specific targets and multiple enemies besides. Additionally, The Herta’s Ultimate can also Transfer the highest Interpretation stacks to Elite or stronger enemies, before dealing Ice DMG to all enemy targets.” The second character making her debut is Aglaea from Amphoreus. She bears the divine authority of “Romance,” and is one of the earliest Chrysos Heirs to embark on the Flame-Chase Journey. As Okhema’s dressmaster, Aglaea isn’t just a legendary hero of Amphoreus, but she is also a major figure in recruiting new Chrysos Heirs to embark on the world-saving journey after the Flame-Chase Journey was interrupted prior. As the first limited 5-star Remembrance character, Aglaea can summon her memosprite Garmentmaker in battle to fight alongside her. They demonstrate a duet dance aesthetic in combat. Additionally, through their cooperation, Aglaea and her Garmentmaker can synchronize attacks on enemies. This new joint attacking mechanism not only increases the Garmentmaker’s SPD, and also adds a new layer of rhythm and variability to combat, allowing an exquisite dance for two to unfold at a charming cadence. In addition, in the first half of Version 3.0, there will also be a special Warp event. Limited 5-star characters Lingsha, Feixiao, and Jade will be making reruns. In the second half, the 5-star characters Boothill, Robin, and Silver Wolf will also be making a limited return. These characters will serve stronger reinforcements, walking side by side with Trailblazers to embark on a journey across Amphoreus. Aside from this, March 7th will gain a Preservation outfit. It can be claimed after unlocking the “Characters” function and logging in during the Version 3.0 period. Meanwhile, the Honkai: Star Rail Trailblazer Edition PS5® Physical Disc Bundle will soon be available for purchase, both online and in physical stores! System Optimizations Lastly, we’ve listened closely to player feedback and, in this major Version 3.0 update, have implemented several system optimizations to improve the gameplay experience! Among the new additions is the “Flying Amphora”. Smashing a Flying Amphora will grant you a boost in movement speed as you traverse the open world. Meanwhile, to ensure new players can easily enjoy the main storyline of Amphoreus, we’ve also made adjustments so that after completing the “Silent Galaxy” Trailblaze Mission, you can head directly to Amphoreus without difficulty. Version 3.0 also brings updates to the new Leveling Guide system that allows Trailblazers to evaluate their character’s strength, with recommendations on Character Level, Light Cone, Traces, Relics and more. We’ve also introduced the “Wishful Resin” and “Variable Dice”, allowing targeted modification and redistribution of a Relic’s Main and Sub Stats, offering more flexibility in developing companions. But that’s just the beginning — many more exciting improvements await your discovery! These are just some exciting updates in Version 3.0 — there’s plenty more to explore and enjoy! We wish you all a year filled with adventure, growth, and great moments in Honkai: Star Rail.",

This new joint attacking mechanism not only increases the Garmentmaker’s SPD, and also adds a new layer of rhythm and variability to combat, allowing an exquisite dance for two to unfold at a charming cadence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cvideo data-src=\"https://blog.ja.playstation.com/uploads/sites/7/2025/01/bc0ce4c3174c1849322c0f95766221b58e5fea48.mp4\" preload=\"metadata\" autoplay=\"\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"\"\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, in the first half of Version 3.0, there will also be a special Warp event.

Among the new additions is the “Flying Amphora”. Smashing a Flying Amphora will grant you a boost in movement speed as you traverse the open world. Meanwhile, to ensure new players can easily enjoy the main storyline of Amphoreus, we’ve also made adjustments so that after completing the “Silent Galaxy” Trailblaze Mission, you can head directly to Amphoreus without difficulty. Version 3.0 also brings updates to the new Leveling Guide system that allows Trailblazers to evaluate their character’s strength, with recommendations on Character Level, Light Cone, Traces, Relics and more. We’ve also introduced the “Wishful Resin” and “Variable Dice”, allowing targeted modification and redistribution of a Relic’s Main and Sub Stats, offering more flexibility in developing companions. But that’s just the beginning — many more exciting improvements await your discovery!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese are just some exciting updates in Version 3.0 — there’s plenty more to explore and enjoy!
