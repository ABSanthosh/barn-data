Not only is Part 2 coming to PC, the long-awaited second season of HBO's live-action TV adaptation begins too - and Sony is squeezing into the middle of that mushroom-scented sandwich with a limited edition DualSense controller themed around developer Naughty Dog's acclaimed games. The DualSense wireless controller – The Last of Us Limited Edition, as it's officially known, arrives on 10th April (Part 2 comes to PC on the 3rd and the show starts on the 13th), featuring \"glossy trophy icons\" representing key moments, characters, and events from both games. Unfortunately, you've been lumbered with me instead of Eurogamer's resident The Last of Us expert Victoria Kennedy for this one - so instead of an insightful breakdown explaining how all the little pictures relate to the game, my only passing thought is the black and white design and subtle embossing looks surprisingly tasteful. Not sure about those big white icons though. The Last of Us - DualSense Controller Reveal | PS5 The Last of Us - DualSense controller reveal trailer.Watch on YouTube Anyway, here's what Naughty Dog has to say about the whole thing: \"We wanted to ensure that both instalments of The Last of Us are represented, via trophy icons printed in black gloss across the controller body. Among the trophies, three particular images will immediately stand out for TLOU fans: The firefly, moth, and wolf. Players will recognise the Fireflies’ iconic spray-painted logo that originated in Part 1, while the moth and wolf represent the intertwining lives and duality between Ellie and Abby in Part 2.\" Image credit: Sony Sony's The Last of Us DualSense controller launches on 10th April and costs £74.99 / €84.99 / $84.99. However, anyone looking to jump in line early - given the \"limited quantities\" it's being released in - can pre-order on the PlayStation website starting at 10am, 14th March, local time. All this The Last of Us activity comes as Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann this week warned fans, \"don't bet\" on there being a The Last of Us Part 3.",
