In an interview with IGN at San Diego Comic-Con 2025, Gunn gave us a scoop that fans who have worked out who’s who in the History of Metahumans DCU Mural will find very interesting indeed.If you haven't seen Superman yet and you're wondering what all the fuss is about, the movie reveals that metahumans have played an active role in the DCU for the past 300 years, and the mural depicts which costumed heroes have appeared so far.This week, Gunn published the full Hall of Justice History of Metahumans mural online for all to see, sending fans into a frenzy as they tried to work out the identity of each of the 26 featured characters. This was the first time fans could see the mural clearly after it was shown in blink-and-you’ll miss it form during Superman.Anyone take your fancy?Which two will make it into the DCU?“Listen, fans have done a pretty good job,” Gunn told IGN. “I think they've found all of the different characters. But yeah, I will just say that in one of our scripts we're working on two of those characters are kind of important.”Which characters are they, we followed-up?“I’m not going to tell you!” Gunn responded in typically tantalizing fashion.Let’s start with what script this might refer to. There is a long list of DCU projects either waiting for scripts to be finalized or in production. Gunn is reportedly considering expanding the rebooted universe with TV spinoffs for characters such as Mister Terrific and Jimmy Olsen. Could either of those feature the two characters in question?DC Universe: Every Upcoming Movie and TV ShowWe recently learned that Booster Gold will at least get an HBO Max pilot. Paradise Lost is still supposedly in the works, as is Sgt. Rock. Then there’s Swamp Thing, Lanterns, Clayface, The Brave and the Bold (the DCU's upcoming Batman movie), Waller, and plenty more.As for who’s actually in the mural, we’ve got a rundown of every character we were able to identify, including the likes of Atomic Knight, Gunfire, and Sandman (Wesley Dodds). In truth, it could be anyone in the mural, and it could relate to any project, announced or unannounced, in the works at DCU. But given Gunn went as far to drop this big tease, he must be confident they will eventually be realized on-screen.All 26 characters in the History of Metahumans DCU Mural:Sister Symmetry/Madame XanaduSilent KnightExoristosBlack PirateMiss LibertyWhip Whirlwind (Max Mercury's Wild West persona)Super-ChiefEl DiabloIron MunroGhost of FlandersSandman I (Wesley Dodds)Amazing-ManZatara the MagicianLiberty BelleBulletmanBulletgirlMax MercuryTNTDan the Dyna-mitePhantom LadyAtomic KnightFreedom BeastWildcatVibeGunfireSean Gunn's Maxwell Lord IVWesley is Director, News at IGN.
