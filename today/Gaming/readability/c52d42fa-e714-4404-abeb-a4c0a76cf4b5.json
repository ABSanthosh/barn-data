  "text": "SummaryIchigo Kurosaki’s most powerful form, Final Getsugatensho is revealed with unique combat mechanics, different from other characters in the gameThere are a total of three different Ichigo Kurosaki forms that you can play in Multiplayer Mode or through the progression of Story ModeBleach Rebirth of Souls is available on March 21, 2025 for Xbox Series X|S. Bleach Rebirth of Souls is an upcoming fighting action game based on the legendary anime franchise, delivering an immersive Bleach experience. Engage in thrilling one-on-one sword combat with your favorite characters and unlock powerful forms to overturn the tide of battle – the more desperate the situation, the more powerful you become! Of course, a Bleach game would be nothing without protagonist Ichigo Kurosaki – and we have some news on the classic character. Ahead of the game’s release on March 21, we’re excited to reveal Ichigo Kurosaki’s most powerful form, Final Getsugatensho and its unique playstyle – as well as his two other forms, Bankai and base. Through the Story Mode, re-live iconic battles and moments from the Bleach storyline and experience the growth of Ichigo Kurosaki as he discovers his new powers and unlocks powerful transformations. In the game, this will be represented by three different forms, each as a separate playable character, which will come with different combat styles to best suit his stage of growth in the Story Mode. Let us run you through each one. Ichigo Kurosaki (Final Getsugatensho) Ichigo Kurosaki (Final Getsugatensho) appears in the battle with Sosuke Aizen, the main antagonist in the Battle of Karakura Town Arc. The most unique feature of this form is that the combat mechanics are very different from other characters in the game. In this form, Ichigo cannot activate his Awakening state (an ability that significantly boosts stats and abilities) like other characters, but upon landing the Kikon Move (a powerful attack that depletes your opponent’s remaining life force) in succession three times, victory is yours! What also makes the Final Getsugatensho form unique is that Ichigo’s Signature Moves are unstoppable and cannot be guarded, making his combo chains incredibly dangerous when executed flawlessly. Ichigo Kurosaki (Bankai) Ichigo Kurosaki’s other alternate form is his Bankai state, offering an advanced sword technique that allows one to unleash the full power of their Zanpukuto (sword), which becomes available after the training arc in the Story Mode. The Awakening state for Ichigo Kurosaki (Bankai) activates his “Hollowfication”, increasing overall performance where he gains a boost in Spiritual Power, allowing his powerful moves to deal additional damage. While in Hollowfication, upon taking additional damage and filling out the Awakening Gauge, you have the ability to unleash Reawakening, where Ichigo will transform into the final stage of Hollowfication called “Full Hollowfication”, unlocking wild, high-powered attacks. This is the base form of Ichigo Kurosaki and is a playable character during the iconic battle against Byakuya Kuchiki in the Soul Society Arc. His combat mechanics are simple but have the potential to do massive damage against his opponents – especially with his movement abilities, which allow him to quickly close the distance to strike the enemy with a powerful attack. During Ichigo’s Awakening state, he will be able to execute combo attacks in quick succession, enabling you to diversify your battle style against different opponents. All three Ichigo Kurosaki forms will be available in both the Story and Multiplayer Modes. However, in the Story Mode, you can experience Ichigo’s journey right from the start, following his rise to become a Soul Reaper, and the challenges he faced to unlock new powers. Play as Ichigo Kurosaki in Bleach Rebirth of Souls when it launches later this week, March 21, for Xbox Series X|S! BLEACH Rebirth of Souls Bandai Namco Entertainment America Inc.
