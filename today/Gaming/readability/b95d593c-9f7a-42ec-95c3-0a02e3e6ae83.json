With enhanced and improved building tools, you can design a true water and theme park paradise that will delight and thrill your guests. The latest free updates have included many new features for players to explore including modular souvenir shops, on-ride photos for guests to take home their memories, and tasty sit-down restaurants that can be fully customised to fit any theme in your park. Returning themes from the original Planet Coaster have also unlocked even more creative possibilities! With this in mind, we’ve picked some of our favourite Xbox community creations from the Frontier Workshop to get you inspired and we can’t wait to share them with you! These blueprints and park builds show off the fantastic tools and features you can use to create amazing theme and water parks in Planet Coaster 2, which can be downloaded into your game. 1. Lazy River by Baaty Share Code – 62T-9L7-44L A lazy river is a classic staple in any water park! The use of scenery items like the inflatables scattered around the pool add a fun moment of realism to the paradise created by the trees and plants along the water’s edge. A great example of the scenery brush, a tool that gives you the ability to place lots of objects in a short amount of time! 2. Ragnarök Ridge – Viking Themed Coaster by BluerRoosterUK Share Code – 1NY-G28-19L Building rides in Planet Coaster 2 isn’t only about the visuals! This epic build doesn’t just look great as a focal point for any park, it boasts excellent stats, making it ideal for Franchise Mode. It also features amazing custom animatronics that breathe life into this fierce Viking-themed rollercoaster. 3. Shabadoo’s Electric Garden by Daypass Share Code – 3JG-Y3Y-S3Y Dark rides are a fantastic way to play with the lighting in your park, and this ride shows that off brilliantly with a range of glowing scenery pieces and lights that really stand out! The number of lights and effects in Planet Coaster 2 allow you to create awesome dark ride experiences that your guests (and you – thank you first person mode!) can enjoy. 4. AquaAdventure World by SplashZone Share Code – 2Z6-8J0-PJT This theme park is what Planet Coaster 2 is all about! Using rocks, water and terrain tools allows you to add levels to the space, instead of having a flat theme park. The fantastic mix of coaster and water park elements on an epic scale looks amazing and goes down well with your guests too. 5. Fantasy Building by Birtie Share Code – 1F2-J6W-016 Planet Coaster 2’s themes have wonderful versatility for creating details in your parks. By using the Aquatic, Mythology and Viking themes, this park building adds the perfect fantasy flair with all the little details – we want to walk around here ourselves!
