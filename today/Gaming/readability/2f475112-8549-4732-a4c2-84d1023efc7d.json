Add to this the recent price increases across LEGO's products, and your wallet is definitely getting a workout. The standout of this deal roundup is the LEGO Mighty Bowser, which we reviewed at the time of its release. We consider it to be one of the best LEGO sets ever designed, in the time since we began reviewing them six years ago.Also worth noting is the Back to the Future Delorean Time Machine, which allows you to build all three versions from the three respective films. Also don't miss out on the Optimus Prime, which actually transforms from vehicle to Autobot and back again.Kevin Wong is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in LEGO.
