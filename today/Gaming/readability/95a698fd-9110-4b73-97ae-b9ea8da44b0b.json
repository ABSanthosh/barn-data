  "text": "Monkey D. Luffy joins Luka Doncic and Lebron James on the court. Anime and sports have crossed paths more than once, and for good reason. Just in the past couple of years, sprinter Noah Lyles \"Kamehameha-ed\" after winning gold at the Paris Olympics, and tennis player Coco Gauff made headlines for watching My Hero Academia \"to warm up\" at the U.S. Open. The fact is, anime is awesome, and part of what makes it so great is its motivational storylines. Few anime have made as much of an impact in that department as One Piece. Tonight, that anime is being featured by none other than the Los Angeles Lakers, headlined by Lebron James and Luka Doncic, in their NBA game against the L.A. Clippers. Will the Straw Hat Pirates (and a pretty stacked team) bring the Lakers to victory? Predictions say… probably? Maybe? Either way, it's a solid game to watch. If you’re wondering how to stream the Lakers vs. Clippers game online, check out the details below. When Is the Lakers x One Piece Collaboration? The Lakers x One Piece collaboration takes place during their game against the Clippers tonight, Friday, February 28, at 10pm EST/7pm CST. It’s a home game for the Los Angeles Lakers at the Crypto.com arena. Where to Stream the Lakers vs. Clippers Game Online The L.A. rivalry game is airing on ESPN, Sportsnet LA, and FDSSC. If you have those channels on cable, you’re good to go. Otherwise, there’s a couple of ways to stream the game live: ESPN on fuboTV Live Sports on fuboTVOffers a seven-day free trialfuboTV is a live TV subscription that includes ESPN. The service offers a 7-day free trial, with subscriptions starting at $84.99/month. While I wouldn’t recommend it just for this game, fuboTV does offer a pretty extensive network of sports channels if anyone’s looking for a long-term sport streaming service. Right now, fuboTV also has a special offer for the first month of any subscription plan, so your first month of either the Essential or Pro plan (the Pro plan includes regional sports coverage) would cost the same discounted price: $54.99. NBA on DirectTV StreamDirecTV Stream (Entertainment Package)Sign up now for a 5-Day free trial! Includes over 75 channels.DirecTV is another live TV streaming subscription that includes ESPN in a number of its plans, including its cheapest one, the Entertainment Package, which starts at $74.99/month. NBA League Pass Premium, which offers “continuous in-arena coverage during breaks,” is included in the Choice package and is also available as an Add-On for other plans. DirecTV also offers a free trial, though a slightly shorter one at only five days.How Is One Piece Involved? This isn’t the first time One Piece has collaborated with a major sports team, and it won’t be the last. The Straw Hat Pirates made their way to Fenway Park for a Boston Red Sox game in 2024, and they’ll be returning to Fenway Park in May of 2025. Ahead of the game, Crunchyroll unveiled new visuals highlighting the Straw Hat Pirates in Lakers attire. Tonight’s game will feature a new animation of the one and only Monkey D. Luffy shooting hoops, and attendees will receive the Lakers x One Piece T-shirt. Prizes will be handed out at the game itself, where there will also be a “One Piece Bounty Rush” photo booth. When Is the One Piece Anime Returning? The Lakers x One Piece collaboration is taking place while the One Piece anime is on a break. While series creator Eiichiro Oda continues to produce new chapters for the manga on his regular schedule, the anime has been off air for almost four months. The wait should be over soon, though: New episodes of One Piece will begin airing again in April, with the Spring/Summer anime season. Originally posted: Mar 1, 2025 12:30 amIn This Article",
