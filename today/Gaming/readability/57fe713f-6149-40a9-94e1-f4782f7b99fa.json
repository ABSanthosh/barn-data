  "description": "Although Ron Gilbert came back to the Monkey Island franchise with Return To Monkey Island in 2022, it's unclear when or if the series will ever get another official sequel. But that hasn't stopped a group of die-hard Monkey Island fans from making their own unofficial game, The Booze of Monkey Island.The new title is descripted as a \"love letter\" to the classic Monkey Island games by small studio Bean Adventure Agency, which created The Booze of Monkey Island. Like the games that came before it, players are put into the role of Guybrush Threepwood in a point-and-click adventure. This isn't a full-length game, but it seems to recapture the flavor of its predecessors. After surviving a shipwreck, Guybrush finds himself back on Booty Island, which was last seen in Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge. Speaking of LeChuck, Guybrush's nemesis has returned to menace him and his partner, Elaine, so Guybrush needs to get off Booty Island as soon as possible. The local bartender agrees to assist Guybrush's attempts to repair his ship, but only if Guybrush can drum up some business at the bar.Continue Reading at GameSpot",
