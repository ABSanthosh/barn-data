The Campaign begins soon We still don’t know what the campaign will look like.  We won’t get to see the pledge tiers and pricing until the campaign goes live next week.  But we know the date. It has been quite a journey to get here for the team I am sure.  More than five years ago I made passing mention of an article over at VentureBeat that announced Raph Koster and Eric Goldberg had raised $2.7 million in seed venture capital for their new company called Playable Worlds. (I also mentioned ManaWorks in that post and I am not sure where they stand at this point.) That was on the other side of the great metaverse bubble that most everybody has since gotten over, save Mark Zuckerberg, and even the wanna be Elon is thinking about throwing in the towel if setting fire to just a couple billion more dollars fails to improve login numbers. But I’ll get back to mocking the detestable Zuck later this week. It is enough to say that Playable Worlds was able to ride that wave for a bit while Raph appeared to be a paragon of reason in the midst of the hype… and the crypto grifters, who were desperate to hook their failing blockchain scams to any new idea… and no doubt got the funding to carry on during those heady times. Then came the fall as the gaming growth cycle of over a decade turned out not to be a “forever” thing and investment began drying up as the layoff count grew, leaving us with the current state of the industry in 2025. But we got the big Stars Reach announcement back in June of 2024, the game they had been working on was revealed.  There was lots of talk of vision and pillars and then some early pre-alpha tests began.  There is something there, something to support the vision.  Now the team just has to get the game to the finish line. Enter the Kickstarter campaign, an attempt to prove to investors that there is sufficient interest in the game to warrant further investment.  So the following pitch is aimed at us. Embark on an unparalleled journey in Stars Reach, a groundbreaking sandbox science-fantasy MMORPG that invites you to explore a meticulously simulated, shardless galaxy teeming with life. Forge your destiny as you traverse diverse planets, each with dynamic ecosystems. Every cubic meter is simulated: players tunnel through rock, sand slumps, water flows naturally and freezes when it gets cold, vegetation grows and dies, and weather patterns influence gameplay. Engage in action-packed combat against alien adversaries that can blow craters in the ground, master a comprehensive skill-based progression system, and participate in a fully player-driven economy that offers peaceful professions and the opportunity to govern entire planets. Developed by industry veterans, including the visionary behind Ultima Online and Star Wars Galaxies, Stars Reach pushes the boundaries of simulation and immersion in MMOs, delivering an experience where your choices shape the universe. There are currently around 7,000 people following the campaign.  That is about half the number of people who pledged for Camelot Unchained or Crowfall, about a third of the number who bought in on Shroud of the Avatar, and maybe a fifth of the count that pledged for Star Citizen, all of which made it to about the two million dollar mark. So it will be interesting to see how much the ask is for this campaign.  I think I said elsewhere that anything less than a million dollars will probably not set the right tone.  And I suspect they could get there with the right items on offer. We shall see.  Just have to wait until Tuesday. Until then the team has scheduled a series of play tests this week to give more people a chance to see the state of things.
