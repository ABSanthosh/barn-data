  "text": "\"We're already in contact with Nintendo and working on some development kits.\"The widely popular hero shooter Marvel Rivals is seeing massive success on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC. But its developer NetEase has been firm that it's not coming to Nintendo Switch, leaving Nintendo players out of luck on joining in the fun. But what about the Nintendo Switch 2?We had the opportunity to pose this question to Marvel Rivals producer Weicong Wu this past week at the DICE Summit in Las Vegas. And fortunately for Switch fans, it sounds like a Switch 2 release is a real possibility. As Wu put it: \"We're already in contact with Nintendo and working on some development kits. And whenever we find that we could provide great performance for our game on Switch 2, we're open to that. The reason why we didn't launch it onto the Switch, it was the first generation of that device they cannot provide a great experience for our gameplay. So if it could achieve that goal, we're open to that.\"The Nintendo Switch 2 was finally officially announced just last month. While we don't have too many details on its capabilities just yet, it appears to be a bigger and more powerful Nintendo Switch system. Notably, it looks like the console will have some sort of mouse-like controller functionality that could potentially make playing shooters like Marvel Rivals a bit more PC-like, though it still remains to be seen exactly how this will work.The Nintendo Switch 2 doesn't have a release date currently, but a Nintendo Direct has been confirmed for April 2. Marvel Rivals, meanwhile, is out now on other platforms, and we like it a lot. In our 8/10 review, we said that it \"may be following closely in the slipstream of the hero shooters that have come before it, but by doing so Marvel Rivals has firmly placed itself in a strong position to take the crown for itself.\" The Human Torch and The Thing are set to be the latest heroes joining the game on February 21.Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
