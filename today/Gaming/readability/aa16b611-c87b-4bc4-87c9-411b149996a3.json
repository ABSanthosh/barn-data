  "text": "In Is This Yours?, you find yourself helping people who lost things by going through four bins and finding their missing items.  The game itself is extremely simple, with the first world being at an airport’s lost and found. You see an animal looking for a specific item appear at the bottom of the screen. You need to read what they are looking for, then find the item in one of the four boxes, bringing the item to the designated place at the top of the screen. In all of the levels, the animals looking for their lost items do get frustrated quickly, so you need to find the items fast!  Once you’ve completed a level, you can go to the next. Each level of Is This Yours? has the items in different places, sometimes buried under other items, and sometimes boxes are even empty. The phrasing for the various items stays the same, so it’s easy to learn what you are looking for without reading it all, but the animals often ask for different items each time. If you aren’t a fan of racing against the timer while digging for stuff, there is a Zen mode where you are just whittling down the item to the final thing. You can easily finish Is This Yours? in one sitting. It’s a relaxing game that feels a little repetitive as you get to the end. I am also not sure if all of these items would be allowed in an airport (A sword?!). At the moment, the game only has the airport chapter, but there seems to be a second chapter in the works, as you can already see the levels laid out for this bit!  If you are looking for a simple game that you can finish in an afternoon and you want to sort out things, it’s got cute visuals and feels nice! Is This Yours? is available for free on iOS and Android.
