  "text": "Image credit: Re-Logic/ Pocket Pair You can put the Terraria in Palworld, but can you put the Palworld in Terraria? Well, uh, yes, apparently. Earlier this week Palworld's Tides of Terraria update was released unto the world, adding in things like fishing, a new trust mechanic, and obviously some Terraria themed bits like monsters to fight and items to get. Now, in a post shared on the Terraria forums, a new look at the survival game's next update, version 1.4.5, showed off its own Palworld update. Now, I should note that not much was shown off from the Palworld additions, but it was confirmed to be arriving with the next update. A GIF was also included in the post showing a new pet companion, Digtoise, a Pal that looks as if Blastoise and Bowser had a baby. Digtoise can, as its name suggests, can dig into the ground, adding blocks of dirt and presumably other materials to your inventory. The forum post also notes that the team is \"working in secret to bring some of your favorite Pals to life in the world of Terraria! What other Pals might appear? What other Palworld content might you see? Who knows?\" I'm assuming they know at the very least! In terms of non-Palworld related things coming in the update, there's some new furniture sets coming, notably some fancy ones. Nothing that exciting, but more stuff is more stuff. Aside from that, the post made one other thing clear: \"we still do not have a release date to give out. Every day is one day closer, of course, but we are trying to remain overly cautious and conservative in regards to giving out any timing. We do not want to repeat the mistake of giving out a timing window and then have things change and it not be accurate. So, we must once again ask for your continued patience as we do the hard work that needs to be done in order to ensure a quality update for everyone.\" It also notes that everything is moving along as fast as it can without making the team crunch on it, but completely ruled that out, which is a refreshing thing to hear at this point honestly. I'm sure it'll be ready when it's ready!",
