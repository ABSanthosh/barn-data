Razer steps into the handheld gaming space with a simple but well-designed dock that will be useful for a variety of devices. As the line between handheld and home consoles blurs there's been more of a need--and want--for docks that can bridge the gap between small and big screen gaming. For most people, it's an experience that is familiar thanks to the Switch, but these days it's not a feature exclusive to Nintendo's devices.

Along with a HDMI out and few USB ports to connect peripherals to, JSAUX docks include an ethernet port, making both working and gaming with good internet stability much more viable.Razer's Handheld Dock Chroma isn't very different from these, despite being more expensive at $80. However, it does address a couple of key issues I always have with docks. The first of these is docks aren't typically very nice to look at and the second being the stability can often be an issue. Razer sent over a dock for testing; I've been using it for about a week and, as a whole, I'm impressed with it as an overall package. It doesn't do anything unique, but it does offer everything you would want and need from a hardware and connectivity standpoint while also being designed in a thoughtful way.Razer Handheld Dock Chroma with Steam DeckGallery First and foremost, those looking to use the Handheld Dock Chroma as more than just a charging device with HDMI out capabilities will be able to make the most of the three USB 3.2 and/or the USB Type C ports to plug in keyboard, mice, controllers or anything else that's required to make a PC-handheld function as a desktop computer. There's a HDMI port that supports 4K at 60hz for external screens, and a gigabit ethernet port. There's also 100w passthrough for power. Again, it's mostly standard features and available in both JSAUX's docks and Valve's official dock for Steam Deck.However, where Razer's dock stands out is the mechanism used to hold devices in place. It's a back plate that covers the rear of most devices and provides good support and prevents any wobbling or tipping. This might sound like a simple thing that isn't really a big deal but, for me, I've always disliked the way the JSAUX and Valve docks I've used don't have a back and rely on how the base is shaped to keep devices in place. These all function perfectly fine for most people who don't really think about it, but I always felt my devices were somewhat precariously placed.The back plate design Razer has used gives me much more confidence and, better still, it's adjustable so the angle at which your device is placed can be changed. The backplate can be raised and angled to fit into rubber grooves in the base to lend further stability, but also better accommodate a range of devices. Like other stands, the USB connector that plugs into your device has a goose neck design, so you're limited by how far it can extend, but most gaming devices, phones, and tablets should be able to settle in without issue. I have taken to positioning the back plate at its steepest angle and then placing my ROG Ally X on it for a viewing angle that is much more comfortable on a desk. Adjusting the placement also means that there's a variety of viewing angles available, which is handy if you want people to crowd around a single device for multiplayer (I ain't doing that).Razer Handheld Dock Chroma with Asus ROG AllyWhen not in use, the back plate can be flattened horizontally to serve as a top surface, giving the dock a box-like form factor that makes it much easier to transport. While most docks are lightweight enough to throw in a bag and take with you, the flat, rectangular design makes it much easier to place in sleeves and pockets in bags without worrying if it's scratching something else or being crushed by other things. It also makes it easier to take out and put in. The aluminium chassis makes it feel lightweight and sturdy, and matte black texturing means it can easily blend into most setups. Of course, there's also a button that you can hit to activate and cycle through RGB lighting options on the bottom of the base. It's worth noting that the package only includes the dock--so it's up to you to provide the power source.All that means that the Razer Handheld Dock is a dock that I feel good about having, instead of something that just does the job. It's a versatile, stylish, and sturdy dock that can be used with a variety of devices. It covers its bases by ensuring the hardware has what it needs to leverage the power of your devices for more than just gaming, should you want to, and it's easy to pick-up-and-go with. As previously mentioned, at $80 it's on the higher-end in terms of pricing--the official Steam Deck Dock is $79--but it justifies this with quality that is evident from the moment you take it out of the box.

It\u0026#39;s a versatile, stylish, and sturdy dock that can be used with a variety of devices. It covers its bases by ensuring the hardware has what it needs to leverage the power of your devices for more than just gaming, should you want to, and it\u0026#39;s easy to pick-up-and-go with. As previously mentioned, at $80 it\u0026#39;s on the higher-end in terms of pricing--the official Steam Deck Dock is $79--but it justifies this with quality that is evident from the moment you take it out of the box.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr/\u003e\u003cdiv title=\"[Various] Razer Handheld Dock Chroma\" data-embed-type=\"buylink\" data-ref-id=\"3072\" data-template=\"2\" data-size=\"buylink__large\" data-title=\"[Various] Razer Handheld Dock Chroma\" data-collection=\"\"\u003e                  \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4428827-razerhandhelddockchroma.png\" alt=\"\"/\u003e                                 \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Handheld-Dock-Chroma-Connectivity-Passthrough/dp/B0DS4GDVW2?tag=gamespot-promos-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-event-tracking=\"{\u0026#34;destUrl\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/Razer-Handheld-Dock-Chroma-Connectivity-Passthrough\\/dp\\/B0DS4GDVW2?tag=gamespot-promos-20\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;dwLinkTag\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;precap-vertical|button\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;leadType\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;deal\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;linkLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;BuyButton\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;merchantName\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;seamlessScrollPage\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;searchDim\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;precap-vertical|button\u0026#34;}\" data-track-page-event=\"{\u0026#34;eventName\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Monetization Link Clicked\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;merchantName\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;merchantPrice\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;}\" data-vars-buy-link=\"https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Handheld-Dock-Chroma-Connectivity-Passthrough/dp/B0DS4GDVW2?tag=gamespot-promos-20\" aria-label=\"Razer Handheld Dock Chroma\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e                              \u003c/p\u003e                                                              \u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eDisclosure: Razer provided the Handheld Chroma Dock to GameSpot for testing.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n                                                              \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n\n              \u003cdiv\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?
