Instead, they are real-world artifacts that are currently sitting in Western museums, and each in-game artifact comes with a brief biography of its origin, the culture in which it originated, and why that artifact is so revered by that culture.For example, one of the artifacts shown in the Day Of The Devs segment is the Ngadji Drum, a drum of the Pokomo people discovered in Africa in the 1870s. The drum was stolen by British colonists in the early 1900s and sent to a museum--114 years later, the brother of the Pokomo king became the first person to see the drum since its theft, when he was brought to the museum and allowed to view it in storage.The Day Of The Devs presentation has featured world premieres and updates for multiple upcoming indie games, including Big Walk from Untitled Goose Game developer House House and mixtape from The Artful Escape dev Beethoven \u0026 Dinosaur. It also announced Snap And Grab, an '80s-themed heist game from No Goblin and Annapurna Interactive, as well as a new look at Possessors from Heart Machine and Devolver Digital.Relooted is scheduled to release on Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. No release window was announced during the Day Of The Devs livestream. Jason Fanelli on Google+ Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com",
