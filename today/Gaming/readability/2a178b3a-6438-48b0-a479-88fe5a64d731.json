I went on four fleets on Sunday. One of them was a torp bomber structure bashing fleet out of our new staging Keepstar in Scalding Pass.  These are a normal operation of any war and I had, before moving, stashed away in my capital ship a Purifier and a pile of tech I torpedoes for just such occasions. And the op itself was unopposed… the goal was to blow up one Astrahus, which we did… so aside from “woo hoo, I got on my monthly kill mail I can go fly logi now” it might not merit a mention.  I’ve been there for lots of structures blowing up. But these ops are usually 30 to 50 ship affairs.  That is all you need to hit the damage cap on a smaller structure.  Maybe you get 80 if the fleet ping says it will include a kill mail.  But the ping that went out on Sunday morning filled the fleet.  We had 255 ships ready to go and were getting people on voice coms saying they couldn’t get into the fleet because it was full. Once it was sorted out who could go… people not in staging were declined… we all piled onto a black ops battleship and drained its fuel bay as it sent us all into Insmother. Bombers on the move There were so many people along that the fleet became a bit of a training/refresher exercise in how to do bomber structure bashing fleets, including getting everybody into orbits distant enough from each other that we could cloak on demand, some practice blinking, where you cloak up, uncloak to fire a few salvos, then cloak up again, and the general rules about staying cloaked. We had so many bombers that we split our three launchers out into individual turrets and just fired one of them… and even then I saw nothing but deflections, which means my damage was recorded but discounted because it was in excess of the damage cap for the structure.  We ended up leaving another small bomber group to finish up the job while we flew around and set timers on other structures. The shield round of structure bashing no longer has a damage cap, so we hit several Athanors and another Astrahus, putting them all in the initial reinforced state in under three minutes each with all of us firing full blast.  That many bombers, which fire a torpedo round that is otherwise reserved for battleship hulls… bombers are cloaky glass cannons… can melt some hit points.  Word was that the locals pulled their crabbing capital ships because 255 of us roaming about would have made short work of a dread or carrier had we run into one. I will grant you that Sunday is generally the most active day of the week and with the war and the new expansion EVE Offline said that peak concurrent passed the 38K mark, but we still had enough enthusiasm in our staging system to pull together a full fleet of bombers for what would otherwise be a bit of a mundane most days. The other three fleets I joined on Sunday were in Delve. The question you may have considered on reading the title of this post is “What does Delve have to do with any of this?”  Did Goonswarm just spend the summer taking space to the east and then most of autumn moving into it in what is being described as possibly the largest voluntary alliance move in the history of the game? From Delve to the east Well, yes.  But that was all part of a larger redistribution of space that included Brave taking over Delve, something I posted about, celebrating them being the only member of the PAPI coalition in World War Bee to successfully take 1DQ1-A.  I think that retroactively makes them the winners of World War Bee. (Not to be confused with the Casino War.  Is it strange that the whole of null sec came after us… twice?) Brave has its own reputation of being fun and enthusiastic if perhaps not as fearsome or blood thirsty as some, a reputation that has led the to be viewed as a soft target at times to farm for fights and kill mails.  Pandemic Legion once sat on them and threatened to take their space if Brave didn’t form fleets to feed them. Pandemic Horde has an expeditionary force in NPC Delve that has been hitting Brave for a while now.  These are some of PH pilots who want to shoot things rather than crab all day.  If I were in PH I would be with these pilots, as my ability to tolerate PvE in New Eden has reached its lowest ebb.  Asher wants us to all strive to own a titan, but I lack the will to earn 200 billion ISK.  But that is another story. Since the announcement of the Invasion of Insmother PH has declined to pull back from Delve to reinforce their southern front, opting to try and use Delve as a diversion.  Goons have, since PH started their Delve campaign, come to the aid of Brave, so to continue to do so might get people to jump clone to Delve, which pulls that character away from the Insmother front until they can clone back.  We’ve played that card as well in the past, and it can tire people out though some discipline and planning can mitigate that. The Imperium has a mitigation plan in the form of Control Alt Delve (CAD), a corporation for Alpha clones.  Ideally, everybody in the coalition rolls up a new account, makes a character, follows the detailed instructions about skill plans and bonus skill points, and fairly quickly ends up able to fly the Osprey logi or Ferox DPS doctrine ships that make up the bulk of the fleet.  Command provides some boosters and other support to harden things up, but otherwise you have a low cost phalanx of ready pilots who only every live in Delve and who have corp contracts and ship replacement that keeps things from costing the player after the initial burst of training is done. And it has mostly worked.  I have had a character in the corp since 2022.  Asher mentions it at almost every fireside.  But it hasn’t been hugely popular… until now.  Now, with people coming back to see what the Legion expansion is about and with the prospect of a summer war looming, enthusiasm for the Alpha doctrine has improved such that two fleets on Sunday consisted of logging in, getting in fleet, getting on the titan to wait for a bridge, and then standing down after PH stood down because we out formed them. Sitting on a Brave titan until we docked back up again The third fleet however… was somewhat more spectacular.  I missed the start of it.  I can’t sit around all day waiting for fleets, but when I got back from running some errands I saw that an operation was going on and, before I stepped away, a ping came from Asher saying a big fight was in progress and CAD alts could still join if they logged in and got on the titan. I was game for that and logged in just in time to get bridged into a sprawling fight. Ships in bubbles shooting each other This was a fight that involved a lot of ships from different null sec groups and the battle report that has been share gives a hint as to what is going on in sov null these days I suppose.  Normally I just post the BR header to show the fight, but this one is big so I am going to break it down, starting with the overall summary including the systems that saw action. Battle Report Summary Note Not a hugely destructive fight.  You need to get past half a trillion before it a fight is notable on its destruction merits, and you really need capital ships to get there.  This was just subcaps.  But there were still over 3K pilots involved and 444 kill mails, ships and pods together. Looking at the BR, I’ll start with home team, the Imperium. Representing the Imperium We put 715 pilots on the field across nine different alliances, with GSF making up more than half.  109 of those GSF pilots were in CAD.  We lost 169 ships valued at 22.45 billion ISK. On the other side I’ll start with PanFam, the primary attackers in Delve most days. Representing PanFam PanFam put 317 pilots on the field, most of which were PH members from some of their larger corporations, a number that might have had them simply stand down had they not been able to call on other groups.  They ended up losing 89 ships valued at 12.74 billion ISK. However, they were able to coordinate with another group to bring their numbers up.  So the number one group of attackers on the field was The Initiative. Representing The Initiative… The Initiative Hey, weren’t they on our side at one time? Yeah, they left the Imperium back in mid-2023 and then reset their blue standings with us at the start of the year in an effort to revitalize the balance of power in null sec, which had become two large blocs facing each other. That has meant we now have INIT hunting parties dropping on our ratters for the most part, and that the path to the north of null sec through Fountain is closed to us.  However, when I was bridged into the battle, already in progress, they were our primary targets. My target overview (Also, for that account I set up a second overview window just for targets and I think I need to do that for my main now.) INIT brought more pilots to bear than PH did, though the do live in Fountain, which is just next door.  They also got right in and mixed it up with us while PH seemed… content to pull some range and let INIT absorb the heat.  I mean, I was late to the fight, but my alt got on more than a dozen kill mails and they were all INIT, including the Monitor of Dakr Shines. Does this mean INIT is now joining in with PH?  I don’t know, but for at least a day they were there for a fight.  But if they wanted to prove they were no longer blue to us for reals, I suppose they managed it here.  And they paid the biggest price in the battle, losing 170 ships valued at 34 billion ISK. As noted, that is a fairly trivial price in a game where I’ve been in fights with trillion ISK losses. And that just leaves us with the fourth group… which is pretty much just the randos who don’t belong in any of the previous three groups. Randos represent That is just 20 pilots… and SLYCE Pirates might be PanFam.  But, of note, is Fraternity, PanFam’s one time ally in all things.  PanFam and Frat’s Winter Coalition also reset their standings back at the start of the year and it was an open question as to what that would really mean. Dark Shines really wanted a vibrant and more violent null sec, and INIT was always very independent, even when part of the Imperium, not being above looting their allies.  But would Winter and PanFam be a real division or just performative?  This war is likely the first test of that and… Fraternity didn’t exactly show up for the fight. Now, they live about as far away from Delve as you can in null sec and are mostly active in a much earlier time zone, so maybe they were not invited or not available on short notice.  But it is a data point that they were not well represented… and yet four pilots did show up.  So we’ll see how that shapes up as the war continues. But overall, the Imperium has a plan for Delve and it doesn’t seem to be hindering the Insmother invasion so far.  It isn’t a perfect plan.  On Monday we didn’t get there in time and a Brave Tatara was destroyed by PH. Tatara wreck when we arrived They very effectively used interdictors to delay us at every gate, and some days that is just the way it is going to go. Back at our staging system in Brave space We will see how much keeps happening in Delve.  As I was finishing up this post while eating my lunch yesterday a fight went down as we deployed another Fortizar, this time in the Great Wildlands, on grid with the PH Keepstar in HB-1NJ.  That means a brawl later today, because if PH lets a Fortzar go live like that, then we’ll have supers all over it to attack the Keepstar.",
