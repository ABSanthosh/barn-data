  "text": "SummaryGet ready to venture into the lands of Nahantu – no need to replay the Diablo IV campaign.Learn about your Spiritborn animal guardian spirits and Mercenary companions, and how they can assist on your journey.Get up to speed on The Dark Citadel, Kurast Undercity, Runewords, and more! Welcome, brave adventurers! The darkness has spread, and the Vessel of Hatred expansion brings new challenges and dangers to the world of Diablo IV. This guide is your key to surviving—and maybe even thriving—in this next chapter of the dark world of Sanctuary. How To Begin Have you already played through the base campaign? No need to replay! Skip the base campaign if you’ve already completed it. On the Character Select screen, choose the option to jump straight into the Vessel of Hatred campaign. Haven’t finished the base game? No problem—complete the short prologue first, then return to the Character Select screen to access the VoH campaign. But if you haven’t played through the tantalizing campaign from the base game, it is strongly encouraged you do that to get the most out of the entire story. Exploring Nahantu Enter the lush jungles of Nahantu, home to the Spiritborn. This region is teeming with new towns, dungeons, and strongholds. Fight ferocious demons and warring tribes, navigating the hellish overgrowth of Kurast and the barren desert of Teganze. Meet The Spiritborn Hailing from ancient civilization and native to the Jungles of Nahantu, the Spiritborn complete a coming-of-age ritual where they are tested for days, surviving in the jungle by learning to open their “sight”. They go through a metamorphosis of shedding their past existence for their Spirit Realm self and believe their spirit will be reborn as a powerful animal guardian. You can also double up on the same spirit for different additive benefits. Spirit Guardians represent the connection between humans and the natural world they live in: Gorilla: Excels in defense/physical skills, shrugging off incoming damage and mainly focuses on damage reduction and block. Incarnate skill is Resolve, which can be stockpiled and provide additional damage mitigation. Jaguar: Uses aggressive/fire attacks repeatedly and ramps up in lethality. Incarnate skill is Ferocity, which is a stacking buff that increases attack speed and provides other benefits like cooldown reduction. Eagle: Delivers mobile/lightning focused impacts against priority targets while speeding around the battlefield. The mechanical focus is movement speed and amplifying evade. Centipede: Focuses on poisons/debuffs, by draining the strength from foes with poisoning damage over time and disruptive crowd controls. They also have access to a new class feature called Spirit Hall which gives the freedom to further customize a build with Spiri- based bonuses and the new Skill Tag, Incarnate, which allows the Spiritborn to embody the traits of the Guardian associated with the skill. To further power up the Spiritborn, take advantage of the new Legendaries and Uniques available to find in the review build. Utilizing Mercenaries Unlocked during the Main Quest in Vessel of Hatred, these stalwart partners are here to ensure you never fight alone. Each Pale Hand Mercenary carries their own past, inclinations, and unique skills to rally beside you in combat. Descend into the Den—the secret hideout for the mercenaries—and complete key quests to bring Raheir the Shieldbearer, Aldkin the Cursed Child, Varyana the Berserker Crone, and Subo the Bounty Hunter to your side. Build rapport with them to unlock valuable rewards and powerful loot. Conquer The Dark Citadel Engage in a new co-op PvE end-game experience with the Dark Citadel. Fight alongside 2 to 4 players in action-packed dungeon combat and complex boss fights. Complete the Dark Citadel to earn weekly caches packed with powerful loot and exclusive cosmetic rewards.Journey Into Kurast Undercity. Unlock this intense multi-stage, time-attack dungeon as you progress through the campaign and reach Level 15. Use special keys called Spirit Tributes to influence the type of loot you earn and complete in-dungeon challenges to increase the quality of your bounty. Defeat one of the Undercity’s new bosses to claim your rewards. Harness Powerful Runewords Unlock runes through the speaking with Ormus during the campaign. Equip these runes starting at Level 20, combining Runes of Ritual and Runes of Invocation to create powerful Runewords. Use the Offering resource system to activate and enhance their effects, and insert them into any items containing socket spaces. Maximize Your Character With the Vessel of Hatred expansion, character progression undergoes significant updates: Max Character Level is now 60. World Tiers are redefined as Standard and Torment Difficulties. Each Class receives a new Paragon Board and Legendary Node. New skills, passives, Legendaries, and Uniques are added for each class. New Seasonal Journey Participate in the Season of Hatred Rising with new quests, Realmwalker World Events, and Rupture Dungeons. Earn rewards from the Battle Pass and Reputation systems and discover new dungeons and monsters unique to Nahantu. Utilize Party Finder The new Party Finder feature makes it easy to find or list a party for multiple activities within Sanctuary. Accessible via the Map, in-game Menu, or a pre-set action on the emote wheel, this tool ensures you’ll never have to face the darkness alone. Are You Ready?
