  "text": "But \"standard\" game cards are still a thing. Image credit: Eurogamer Amid all the excitement of Switch 2's big news bonanza, Nintendo has quietly confirmed some physical releases on the console won't have any game data on the included game card. Nintendo is referring to these physical releases as game-key cards and, unlike standard game cards, they'll only contain a download \"key\", rather than the full game data. Inserting the card into your Switch 2 starts the download process, after which you'll need to stick the game-key card into your console any time you want to play. Physical releases containing game-key cards will be clearly labelled on their packaging, with the example on Nintendo's overview page featuring a prominent white strip along the bottom of the box, reading, \"Game-Key Card\" and \"Full game download via internet required.\" It's similar to the messaging Nintendo used on Switch 1 when games were only partially included on cards - LA Noire being an infamous early example - even if the key-on-card approach itself is new. Nintendo Switch 2 – Overview Trailer Switch 2 overview trailer.Watch on YouTube As per Nintendo's explanation, Switch 2's homescreen will provide instructions on downloading the game when a game-key card is inserted into the console for the first time. Players will need sufficient free space either in Switch 2's system memory or on an attached microSD Express card to initiate the download (game-key card boxes clearly state how much space is required), and the game can then be played once the download is complete. This means an internet connection is mandatory the first time a game is launched, but not after - although, to reiterate, game-key card games can't be started unless the card is inserted, unlike downloaded digital Switch 2 titles. None of this is perhaps a hugely encouraging sign for physical media fans, but given Nintendo's confirmation standard regular game cards will still exist, it's hard to tell how commonplace the new game-key card system is likely to become. Today's big Switch 2 blow-out has brought an absolute mountain of new information to wade through away from game-key cards, so if you're looking for somewhere to focus your attention, feel free to check out EG's round-up of everything announced in (and after) today's Direct.",
