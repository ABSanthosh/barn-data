OK, some of them may not be new to you, but they’re new to streaming and digital! Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine is finally available to watch on Disney+, while Megalopolis and Saturday Night are now available On Demand. Among the many other options for the weekend is Silo, which returns for Season 2, and the middle hunk of Cobra Kai’s final season.Dune: Prophecy ComethDune anything is usually treated like a big deal, but early reviews for the new Max series have been middling at best (sitting at an average of 6.5/10 on Rotten Tomatoes) and there seems to be absolutely no buzz either. Still, if you just can’t get enough of that universe, there will be more sand to swim in starting on Sunday (November 17) when Dune: Prophecy debuts. The new prequel series follows a pair of Harkonnen sisters and explores the early world of the fabled Bene Gesserit. Emilia Perez Hits NetflixEmilia Perez is a fever dream, and a divisive one at that. While it was nominated for the prestigious Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival this year, the positive reception started to dwindle after the film went wide. Though, while the criticisms are earned, it should be mentioned that fans and critics still seem to be pretty positive on the movie. It’s worth discovering for yourself but, for me, the movie misses the mark despite solid performances. Twisters Spins Into PeacockThe fact that it’s been a relatively soft year for film as a whole aside, Twisters may actually be my favorite movie that I saw in 2024? This is relatively unsurprising, as I love big, dumb action movies. So, if you love big, dumb action movies, the legacy sequel is now on streaming. Turn on a fan and spritz some water at yourself if, also like me, you’re still upset that you managed to miss the movie in 4DX (that’s the newfangled theater experience that turns your movie watching into a theme park ride for the duration of the film).Other New and Notable Streaming and On Demand Titles This Weekend Megalopolis (On Demand) — November 12Saturday Night (On Demand) — November 12Deadpool and Wolverine (Disney+) — November 12Your Monster (On Demand) — November 12Bad Sisters Season 2 (Apple TV+) — November 13Hot Frosty (Netflix - and yes you read that right) — November 13Cross (Prime Video) — November 14The Day of the Jackal (Peacock) — November 14Cobra Kai Season 6 Pt 2 (Netflix) — November 15Silo Season 2 (Apple TV+) — November 15Thelma (Hulu) — November 15Dune: Prophecy (Max) — November 17In This Article",
