Appropriately, it's set to Limp Bizkit, because of course it is.DEVIL MAY CRY. APRIL 3. #NextOnNetflix pic.twitter.com/ypAHuHcqpJ— Netflix (@netflix) January 30, 2025 The Devil May Cry anime was announced back in 2018 and confirmed an eight episode first season. Studio Mir, known for its work on shows like The Legend of Korra, X-Men '97, and more, would be handling the production of the series.While plot details are being kept under wraps, it appears to be starring Dante from around the time of the first three Devil May Cry games as opposed to Devil May Cry 5, but any connections to the games are unconfirmed. Dante will be voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch who actually voices Nero in the video games.The last Devil May Cry game was Devil May Cry 5 released in 2019. The game was a return to form for the series that had been in somewhat of a hiatus since the release of DmC: Devil May Cry in 2013. As an action game it was one of the best and well worth your time, especially if you've been enjoying games like Ninja Gaiden Black 2 recently.
