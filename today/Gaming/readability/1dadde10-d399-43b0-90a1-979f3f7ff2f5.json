  "text": "\"Nobody should be paying for a port in a state like this.\" Image credit: Team Ninja Rise of the Ronin developer Team Ninja has \"sincerely apologised\" for \"inconveniences\" with its Steam port. In a brief statement posted to X/Twitter, Team Ninja confirmed that it was \"investigating reported issues\" with the game and is preparing a patch to \"fix or improve some of this issues\", which is expected to go live on Thursday 10th April. Newscast: Xbox currently has more first-party games coming to PlayStation 5 this year than Sony Xbox currently has more first-party games coming to PlayStation 5 this year than Sony.Watch on YouTube Rise of the Ronin released on Steam on 11th March 2025, and it's currently sitting on a \"mixed\" user score, with just 57 percent of the 3118 reviewers opting to award it a positive rating. Like many other PC ports of late, much of the criticism is aimed squarely at the game's \"horrible\" optimisation, including issues with enemies loading in for bossfights, missing NPCs, invisible walls, and missing assets like ladders. \"I really like the gameplay, the combat, maybe the exploration (it has its issues, though) but I can't recommend this game in good faith when it has some of the most terrible optimisation ever,\" explained one player. We are currently investigating reported issues for \"Rise of the Ronin\" Steam version. Currently we are preparing a patch, which will be released 4/10 (Thu.), to fix or improve some of these issues.We sincerely apologize for any inconveniences that you may have experienced.— Team NINJA (@TeamNINJAStudio) April 3, 2025 \"Not only that, but they managed to update the game to make it both look AND perform worse in an attempt to band-aid fix the performance issues, effectively ruining something I could at least enjoy before.\" \"A shame, the game seems quite good, but the port is just not worth paying any money for,\" opined another. \"Performance is abysmal, frame rates above 60 fps lead to issues and bugs, and the only way to get a frame rate close to anything playable is to set lots of graphical options to the lowest, leading to a very poor image. I would love to play the game, but nobody should be paying for a port in a state like this.\" We awarded Rise of the Ronin four out of five stars in Eurogamer's review, saying: \"[Developer] Team Ninja borrows the open-world familiarity and historical tourism of Assassin's Creed while adapting its own breed of hardcore action for the mainstream.\"",
