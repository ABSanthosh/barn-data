  "text": "A lot is happening in Fortnite right now! If you’re in the mood to play shooters this holiday, we’ve got you covered. Relive the OG OG Battle Royale experience in Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 1. Become a Ronin to drive back the demons in Battle Royale Chapter 6 Season 1: 鬼 Hunters. Additionally, soon you’ll be able to prove your skill, precision, and teamwork in the new tactical 5v5 FPS, Fortnite Ballistic, launching December 11 into early access. If you’re trying to keep up with the news, don’t worry — we’ll break everything down for you starting with the upcoming new mode. Fortnite goes first-person with Ballistic Ballistic brings a first-person, adrenaline-filled, round-based, 5v5 competitive mode to Fortnite. Round up your squad because strategy, tactical teamwork, and prowess are essential for victory in this brand-new Fortnite experience. All new gameplay At the start of a Ballistic match, you’ll be sorted into one of two teams — attackers and defenders. The attackers’ goal is to plant the Rift Point Device, a reality-tearing explosive that can be primed at one of two sites on the map. The defender’s goal is to.. defend! Do what it takes to thwart the attacker’s plan to plant and detonate the device. Every bit of health matters in Ballistic. There are no respawns in this mode and the rounds come to a quick end if one of the following happens; The Rift Point Device detonates or a team is fully eliminated. After six rounds, the attackers become the defenders (and vice versa). Bring home the victory after winning seven total rounds with your team. Light the fuse Each player starts on a level playing field with 800 credits to spend and the Ranger Pistol weapon. Think strategy, how you choose to spend your Ballistic credits can determine your success in Ballistic.  Rack up more credits by scoring eliminations or planting the Rift Point Device during your attacker rounds. At the beginning of each round, you can spend credits to unlock an arsenal of weapons such as Nemesis AR, Thunder Burst SMG, Reaper Sniper, and more to boost your chances of winning.   You can hold two weapons, one being your primary weapon and the other being the Ranger Pistol. You’ll be able to keep your weapons, shields, and non-consumed items for the next round..if you survive. Just took out an enemy? Feel free to pick up their weapon to use in the next round, finders keepers. While the Rift Point Device can secure your team’s victory, make sure you’re taking shelter at a fair distance away. The blast is unforgiving and being eliminated by it means you’ll lose any items and weapons you have. You have 45 seconds, after successfully arming the device, to take cover.  Sharing is caring in Ballistic, assist your teammates by dropping your weapons and items at any time during rounds. Explosives more their style? You can also drop flashbangs and smoke grenades. If one teammate is making more bank on eliminations, they could drop you a weapon by spending their credits. Fortnite Outfits, Kicks, Wraps, Sprays, and Emotes from your Locker are also available to equip. The cosmetics you can’t bring with you to the matches are Black Blings, Pickaxes, Contrails, Instruments, Vehicles, and Jam Tracks. Gadgets supreme With every start of a Ballistic match, you’ll choose one of five Flex Gadgets — the Proximity Mine, Bubble Shield, Frag Grenade, Recon Grenade, and Impulse Grenade. Choose wisely, once you lock in your gadget, you’ll be the only player on your team who can purchase and use that gadget during the match. If you use your Flex Gadgets correctly, you just might clutch a win.  Early access and Fortnite Ballistic Ballistic is launching with the Skyline 10 map, a starting set of weapons, and a limited number of items. After launch, adjustments may be made based on player feedback, in addition to major updates such as new maps, weapons, and features.  At launch, Ballistic will be available on all platforms and regions where Fortnite is supported, with the exceptions of South Korea and Russia.  Welcome back Fortnite OG – always on, every day Relive the classic Battle Royale experience in Fortnite OG! Fortnite OG takes you back to day one of Season 1 and this time, it’s here to stay! Grab your squad, hop on the Battle Bus, and get ready to experience OG loot and locations from the original launch of Battle Royale in Fortnite OG Chapter 1 – Season 1. Fortnite OG Chapter 1 features the initial Seasons of Battle Royale, faithful down to the feature additions and loot pool swaps. While Fortnite OG seasons are shorter than the current Battle Royale seasons, you can still drop into all the fun with Solos, Squads, and Zero Build at launch.  Some of the rough edges from Chapter 1 have been preserved, while others have been polished. For example, you’ll find Reboot Vans and be able to see the glare from a sniper scope, but Max building resources are set to 999 Last but not least, the original map that launched in 2017 is making its grand return, with classic locations like Retail Row, Pleasant Park, Loot Lake, and more. An era-defining armory The loot pool available from over seven years ago will be accessible on day one of Fortnite OG, including the Pump Shotgun. Yes, the Double Pump playstyle is returning in Fortnite OG along with more items that will become unvaulted as the season progresses! Traps are returning with some key choices such as the Wall Dynamo, Ceiling Zapper, and Damage trap.  Kick it old school with the Fortnite OG Pass The Fortnite OG Pass is giving all the feels by featuring 45 tiers of modern twists on classic rewards. Earn the Aerial Assault Bomber, Skull Commander, and Renegade Rebel Outfits, which also include an unlockable alternate style for each and more nostalgic items in Season 1. You can either get the OG pass in-game or by becoming a Fortnite Crew member, which includes this pass and a ton of other benefits, like the Battle Pass, LEGO Pass, and Music Pass. You can complete the Chapter 1 — Season 1 Fortnite OG Pass until January 31, 2025, at 2 AM ET by earning XP across any Fortnite experience. Drive back the demons as a powerful Ronin in Battle Royale Chapter 6 Season 1: 鬼 Hunters A beautiful new island shrouded in mystical energy and mystery appears, but lurking demons are using masks of power to unleash chaos across the Island. Rise to the challenge as a great hero to cast out ancient evils in Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 6 Season 1: 鬼 Hunters.   Legends come to life Cherry blossoms fall on the new Chapter 6 map — soil long-protected by spiritual forces and timeworn magic. It’s here you’ll make a name for yourself as a demon hunter. Journey through ancient, modern, and supernatural scenery  Demon’s Dojo On the path to becoming a great Ronin, hone your combat skills at the legendary Demon’s Dojo, force the demon lord’s servants out from the grand sanctuary of Warrior’s Watch, or put your fortitude to the test on the mountain peak of Shogun’s Solitude, where powerful foes await your arrival. Seaport City If you’re looking for the hustle and bustle of city life, the Seaport City offers a tightly packed commercial district. See which bun shop serves the best and freshest in the village of Canyon Crossing, or meet travelers like yourself as you move across the Shining Span. Turtle Landmark Travel further along lesser-known paths, and you’ll find yourself surrounded by sacred obelisks and hidden treasures within the overgrown Magic Mosses. Wander amongst the endless darkness of the Nightshift Forest, or pay tribute to The Great Turtle, who watches over the land. Enchantments on medallions, blades \u0026 firearms Enhance your mastery of vanquishing evil by claiming the Wanderer Medallion from the rampaging demon warrior Shogun X. This medallion aids your trials by giving you invisibility and stamina while sprinting. If you hunt down the relentless spirit Night Rose within her domain, you’ll earn the Night Rose Medallion for your efforts, which automatically reload your weapons.  All traditional weapons that support your endeavors are of the hitscan variety, with damage immediately colliding with your enemies from weapons such as the Veiled Precision SMG, Oni Shotgun, and more. If blade work is more your style, wield the destructive Typhoon Blade and unleash a flurry of strikes against your enemies.  To add more magic to your arsenal, seek out lesser demons around the island and defeat them to claim their masks of power! The Fire Oni Mask launches homing projectiles at your opponents and the stealthy Void Oni Mask lets you transport short distances to sneak around your foes.  Make an offering to Sprites and gain powerful boons at Sprite Shrines May fortune be on your side if you encounter charming Air, Water, and Earth Sprites roaming around the island, which grant you unique effects to increase your luck during battle.  By guiding a Sprite to one of the island’s overlooked Sprite Shrines, you can gain a strong Fire, Water, Void, or Wind Boon that grants a unique power for the duration of the match. Boons can also drop from bosses and be found in Chests. Ride in style If you want to get enemies off your trail more quickly, then look no further with the modern, wheely-popping Rogue Bike. The sporty, high-performance Void Burn coupe also leaves them in the dust and adds to your road menace notoriety. New traversal maneuvers If you ever wanted to Ledge Jump, Wall Kick, Wall Scramble, or do a Roll Landing, these features are now a part of Fortnite’s core movement, available across Battle Royale, Reload, Fortnite OG, and creator-made islands.  Conquer the darkness with the 鬼 Hunters Battle Pass Unlock levels of premium rewards in the 鬼 Hunters Battle Pass when you spend 1,000 V-Bucks and earn XP across various Fortnite modes. By progressing the pass, you can earn up to 1,500 V-Bucks and also some formidable Outfits, including: Nyanja (ニャンジャ): Two-tailed trickster Jade: Discover the Island’s myths Kendo: A wandering rōnin with a restless spirit Daigo: Man of a thousand faces Shadow Blade Hope: See through the shadows Disney’s Hero Baymax: Ready to be your hero The Night Rose: A fearsome demon warrior, bound by ancient duty The legends are true. Become a true Titan as Godzilla! The Godzilla Evolved Outfit will be available from Battle Pass Quests in January, which you can complete in any experience. This Battle Pass will be available to progress in until February 21. Join the fun in Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 1 and Battle Royale Chapter 6 Season 1: 鬼 Hunters today. Fortnite Ballistic launches December 11 into early access.",
