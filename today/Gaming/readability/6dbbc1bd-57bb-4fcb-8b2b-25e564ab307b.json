Over in LEGO Fortnite Odyssey, explore and battle for galactic supremacy. The fun continues in Rocket League with the new 2v2 Car Wars LTM. There’s a lot to unpack, but don’t worry — these are the updates you’re looking for! Let’s dive in with what’s happening across Epic Games, starting with Fortnite Battle Royale.  A shadow emerges in Battle Royale Imperial Star Destroyers exit hyperspace in formation around the Death Star, which looms with its superlaser array fixed on the BR map. Heroes from across eras are ready to strike back against the assault led by Emperor Palpatine from the shadows, and the Island’s fate hangs in the balance. Draw your lightsaber and ready your blaster May 2 in Fortnite: Galactic Battle! New places to see, returning weapons to loot Driving back the Imperial invasion will take every blaster and ship at your disposal and these new locations will help you do just that! The First Order Base, Outpost Enclave, Resistance Base, and Vader Samuari’s Solitude are all primed and ready for exploration (and looting!). Just be mindful, you never know who you’ll run into. The preferred weapon of Force users everywhere An elegant weapon for a more civilized age, the use of a lightsaber is the mark of a Jedi, though it’s also used by their sworn enemies, the Sith. Lightsabers are exceptionally handy for deflecting blaster bolts, and wielding one will allow you to sprint faster, jump twice as high, and have immunity to fall damage. You’ll have to prove yourself to earn one, though… Or just loot it off another player. How to prove yourself? Train with hologramic followers of both the light and dark sides to unlock their respective lightsaber and Force Ability. Force Push, Force Lightning, and Force Saber Throw are the Force Abilities you can learn day one, with more becoming learnable later in the Season! So anyway, start blasting As far as non-lightsaber weapons go, it’s blasters-only on day one, with the exception of the Thermal Imploder that’ll cause a blast in its own way. You’ve got your DL-44 Blaster Pistol, ACP Scatter Blaster, E-11 Blaster, and several more. Be careful about holding down the trigger, as these babies are prone to overheating! Looking to dogfight for your next Victory Royale? Pilot the Imperial TIE fighter equipped with high-powered blasters or the nimble X-wing and take to the skies! Weekly updates May 8 – The pull of the Force Sensing a disturbance in the Force, Leia and Luke will arrive on the Island alongside renowned smuggler Han Solo to offer you strategic services! Also, train with hologram Mace Windu to earn a Purple Lightsaber and be taught Force Pull. Pull in just about anything and anyone nearby with this Force Ability. Rumor has it that Sith Lord Darth Maul will also appear as a hologram, offering Red Lightsabers and teaching Force Throw, which allows you to throw nearby objects as projectiles…   May 15 – Chew on this Chewbacca arrives and he’s bringing his Wookiee Bowcaster to the loot pool to aid the rebels. You’ll also find the new, powerful CA-87 Jawa Scatter Blaster in Chests around the Island! May 22 – Mandalorian Rising Mandalorians will intervene this week. Recruit a Heavy, Scout, Supply, or Medic Mandalorian to your team, and gain further advantage over your opponents with the unvaulted Mandalorian Jetpack!  Also, keep an eye out for signature Mandalorian weapons: the Amban Sniper Rifle and the new dual-wield WESTAR-34 Blaster Pistols.  May 29 – Star Destroyer bombardment Be the first to reach the control room of a Star Destroyer which spawns every match. Assume control of its turbolaser to lay waste from above! June 7 – The final showdown: Death Star sabotage Mobilize and take the fight to Emperor Palpatine in a live, in-game narrative event on June 7. Never tell me the odds. Get the Star Wars Battle Pass The Star Wars Battle Pass is full of treasures from across the known galaxy. The Star Wars Battle Pass has both free and premium rewards that can be claimed by earning XP in any Fortnite experience.

More fun begins in LEGO Fortnite Celebrate the most intergalactic time of year in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life’s Star Wars Festival, where you can grab a bite in the Durrr Burger Cantina, score goals in Death Star Soccer Ball, hang out with a Porg, and even acquire your very own Lightsaber Bench. This gathering for Star Wars fans everywhere will be going on from May 2 until June 8, 2025 Eastern Time. In a galaxy just next door, LEGO Fortnite Odyssey is launching a public matchmaking test on May 15 called Rapid Survival — an eight-player public world survival experience on the existing Star Wars Island.  Load in with a pre-determined loadout that includes a Lightsaber, Macrobinoculars, a plethora of building materials, and more to aid in your journey. Even though PvP combat is on, you can also choose to team up against the Star Wars enemies!  Heads-up: Rapid Survival will be open at specific four-hour windows from May 15 until May 26 Eastern Time.  First Order LEGO Pass The ruthless Captain Phasma Outfit is front and center as a premium reward in the First Order LEGO Pass, available starting May 2!

This is a 3v3 mode that lets you unleash unlimited boost, cranked to five times standard power. Navigate the arena faster than the Millennium Falcon on the Kessel Run!
