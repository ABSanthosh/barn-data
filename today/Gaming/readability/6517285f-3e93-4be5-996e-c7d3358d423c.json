  "text": "An aspect of Enshrouded is that they use the same theme for dungeons through multiple zones… which is fine.   Sometimes you want to link things together for a narrative or have some continuity. Welcome to Enshrouded The odd bit is that they just reuse the same name.  Imagine if every zone in WoW had a Deadmines, and you had to distinguish the Westfall Deadmines from the STV Deadmines or some such. This past weekend we started in on our third Hollow Halls, the one in the Nomad Highlands… though I still have problems distinguishing “zones” in Enshrouded.  There isn’t always a hard line between them, like in WoW where the color palette changes visibly when you cross a zones line, or Valheim where each biome is very different.  Sure, the landscape does change and the flora and fauna differ by zone.  But if I am out exploring and you asked me which zone I was in, I would have to answer with something like “the first one” or “the one with the tar” or the one we call “The Barrens” or the one past the barrens or the bit up north with the snow. And all of that is fine.  Real life doesn’t give us obvious zone lines all the time either.  In Silicon Valley the suburbs looks so alike that you sometimes have to look at the name of the road on a sign to tell which city you are in, as every city has adopted its own color scheme.  Viva immersion and all that, but it also makes it difficult at times to tell people where you’ve been. Which is all an aside really, because we were on to our third Hollow Halls.  There are four in the game currently, according to the wiki, and the door to a fifth is present so the theme will continue. We were on to the third Hollow Halls, which we ran out to on Sunday. Hollow Halls all have the same red marble look The first Hollow Halls (and I swear I keep typing “Hallowed Halls” for reasons unknown) got us The Collector, one of the NPCs you have to rescue, while the second got us ectoplasm press, which sounds like a set item from a Ghostbusters sequel.  After the first one, the rest require a key which The Collector can make, but which requires items from the previous one. Fortunately we learned that on the second one, but only after we ran out there and were standing at the door without the key.  This time around we showed up with the key in hand. This will get us in As with the spires throughout the land, the Hollow Halls have a common style and follow a number of similar conventions, which each has its own special twist or plan.  For the Nomad Highlands, the theme seemed to be flying through the air indoors… or maybe falling to one’s death… either fits. This time around, after getting in, hitting the first teleport pad that gets you into the thick of things (also a spire convention), and finding the first flame shrine/respawn point, we were presented with a great bit hole in the floor. Just a big hole in the place Peering into the hole, it looked like it had been driven through several floors.  The question, at first, was how far down into the hole did we need to go?  We tried a few times to land on different levels on the way down, only to be waylaid by bats or to hit something while gliding in the dark… at which point you go from gliding to plummeting until you can deploy your glider again or hit something and possible die.  I died.  So did Potshot. Ula survived, but only just. After some experimentation, I decided to just jump in the hole and drop until I got to the bottom level before deploying my glider, which seemed the way to do it.  I kept going down until I hit a big open room, then glided to a landing on a platform off to one side. This was the first room, which announced the theme of this Hollow Halls, which was jumping and gliding and otherwise going up to places where you could easily fall from and die if you were not careful. This room had platforms and grappling hooks and the little glowing thing that you need to run/fly through to open up the barrier keeping you from advancing to the next stage of the dungeon.  Ula and Potshot joined me down the hole, and we rather chaotically ran around the place until we found all the things and opened up the barrier. We went through the now open portal and found the next flame shrine.  That is the pattern.  After each objective is finished you get a flame shrine… which serves as the respawn point if you die doing the next objective. We fought our way through another section of trash and eventually ended up in a huge room with pillars and lava and rubble and a big boss mob wandering around the middle. There he is… I am way over there on the other side of some lava from him because, while his standard attacks were not all that much, every so often he would put down a green circle around himself and everybody in that circle got tossed way up in the air, far enough that if you didn’t think to deploy your glider you were likely to die on landing.  So that was where I ended up after gliding… though not before I learned the hard way about dying. Potshot also learned about dying, though I ran out from the flame shrine after respawning and managed to revive him where he lay. Revive coming And then the boss came over and tossed us again and I glided to where I landed above and Potshot died again.  It was that kind of event.  So we got back together and kited him around and got into melee range after he did his toss the circle move and wore him down.  It was more a matter of figuring out how to fight him. That done, we looked around at the huge underground chamber we were in and I could see some more of those glowing thing way up high.  We had some work ahead of us. There they are, way up there It was a complicated routine, with those things up in towers and in the middle of the air and what not.  The barrier, at the far end of the chamber had 10 hash marks, which we guessed to mean that we had 10 of those things to collect. Nice of the barrier to give us a count So it was a bit of a climbing and gliding adventure.  It was, as puzzles go, kind of fun.  There were teleport pads that took you up towers and gaps to jump and another set of teleport pads to get even further up.  Meanwhile, some of the towers had objectives in them that you had to grapple up to, if you could find the grapple.  Some were easy.  There were some floating ones up in the air that took us multiple tries to swoop down on to collect, all while avoiding landing in the lava pools that were around the place. Fortunately the barrier kept score for us, dimming the count as we collected them The count is now three… also, a rogue spawn came up and smacked me while I was looking The last three were a bit of a challenge.  One was in a column in the middle of some lava with a grapple on one side you had to approach very carefully. The final one was way up at one of the second teleport pads. Potshot clearing my landing zone I swooped down and got it on the first try… having had enough practice at that point.  That got us the message that the barrier had be unlocked. The ten were found Through the barrier was the expected next flame shrine, then beyond that the next challenge, which involved a set of grapples hung from the ceiling, requiring you to do the Spider-man routing and grab one, swing, let go, then grab the next one to carry on. It is time to swing At the far end of each triple swing like that was a platform with a grapple to drag you to it. I managed to swing and get to the first platform.  But, as with our last swinging challenge, I was at a loss to actually explain how I did it.  I am too busying doing it when I am doing it to pay attention to what I am actually doing, which sounds silly, but I cannot explain it any other way. Fortunately, after a couple attempts and swinging, Potshot found that you could just play the jumping game down on the floor level, where there was plenty of lava, until you got close enough to the platform at the end to grapple up to it. Potshot just walking to the platform Whatever works.  They had to have the grapples like that in case you fell in, but it also served as an alternate path. Three sections of that got us around to the last big challenge, which was two platforms, each with a boss standing in the middle of some obstacles.  On one side there were the rolling burning balls, on the other the spiked floors. Over on the spiked floor side of things Being impetuous, or just bad at coordinating, Ula and I glided over to the spike side and Potshot glided to the burning ball side, where all of us managed to die.  We then got our act together and finished off the spiked side then the other side.  Defeating both bosses opened up the final barrier.  We moved to that room expecting one final fight. What is in the final room However, there was just the final chest in there and the teleport pad to take us back to the start of the whole thing.  We had completed the whole thing.  We took our final screen shot and headed out. The trio at the end of the Hollow Hall Of course, that doesn’t mean we saw the whole thing.  Enshrouded has a lot of stuff hidden in places like that.  We’ve gotten better about checking for hidden doors and even dug through a rubble pile blocking what looked like a doorway to find a room with a chest and a skull throne. Just your every day skull throne, as one has There are no doubt other hidden things that we missed.  We’ll see if we have time to go back to find them. But once back at base The Collector’s quest had been updated and he had a key for the next Hollow Halls, this one in the Kindlewastes.  So we have that to find and work through.",

question, at first, was how far down into the hole did we need to go?  We tried a few times to land on different levels on the way down, only to be waylaid by bats or to hit something while gliding in the dark… at which point you go from gliding to plummeting until you can deploy your glider again or hit something and possible die.  I died.  So did Potshot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUla survived, but only just.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some experimentation, I decided to just jump in the hole and drop until I got to the bottom level before deploying my glider, which seemed the way to do it.  I kept going down until I hit a big open room, then glided to a landing on a platform off to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the first room, which announced the theme of this Hollow Halls, which was jumping and gliding and otherwise going up to places where you could easily fall from and die if you were not careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis room had platforms and grappling hooks and the little glowing thing that you need to run/fly through to open up the barrier keeping you from advancing to the next stage of the dungeon.  Ula and Potshot joined me down the hole, and we rather chaotically ran around the place until we found all the things and opened up the barrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went through the now open portal and found the next flame shrine.  That is the pattern.  After each objective is finished you get a flame shrine… which serves as the respawn point if you die doing the next objective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe fought our way through another section of trash and eventually ended up in a huge room with pillars and lava and rubble and a big boss mob wandering around the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv
