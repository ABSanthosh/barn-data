  "text": "One of the big changes that came in with the Thralls of Twilight update that landed back in May was an attempt to make night a thing to explore rather than just a downtime to be avoided or gotten through as quickly as possible. As with like titles in the genre such as Minecraft and Valheim, there are beds and you can sleep your way through the night.  Enshrouded has its own twist on the system.  Unlike Minecraft and Valheim, not everybody has to go to bed to speed on to the next day.  If everybody does get in bed, the night moves at 60x speed and the dawn soon arrives.  But if there are four of you on, as an example, and only one goes to bed, night only goes past at 15x speed, or one quarter the total.  This means that is somebody is out in the field, far from home or a bed, you can still speed the night up somewhat. Though, before the Thralls of Twilight update, I had set night to be just four minutes because there were no benefits to the dark.  It was just harder to find your way around and frankly, aside from our base looking pretty at night all lit up, there wasn’t much call for doing things at night.  Nothing special happened.  It was mostly just inconvenient. Then came the update which promised the following: Night Enemy Patrols – Nighttime enemy activity has been ramped up: Scavenger patrols now roam the roads under cover of night looking for rare resources and items. Keep your torch close… and your weapon closer. Groups of the Fell roam the lands above at night, trying to temporarily spread the Shroud. Night-Blooming Flora – New plants can now be found blooming at night across all biomes. These rare blooms offer unique crafting materials and special food. They are also used for stronger versions of existing potions. Night Temples – Introducing Night Temples, a brand new type of point of interest found in every region of Embervale. These temples: Can only be entered at night: their doors remain sealed during the day. Feature all-new architectural elements and are filled with dangerous traps. Offer exclusive rewards for those who dare to brave their depths. After the update it quickly became apparent that night was no longer optional.  Early on we contracted the hemotoxin plague, a new malady with a special new potion to cure it.  The info say antidote, but the old antidote doesn’t work, you need the special new one, and the critical ingredient comes from moths. The correct antidote Moths, as indicated, only come out at night.  (Spiders… those you can find at all hours.) At first moths were pretty hard to find, little flitting bits in the dark of Revelwood. Those are moths, trust me They actually look quite good in motion, but I was never able to capture a decent screen shot of them. I wasn’t the only one to notice that they were somewhat scarce because a couple of patches later I started finding them all over at night… and not just in Revelwood.  This might be a case of going overboard.  I mean, sure, it is kind of neat seeing them out in Kindlewaste at night, but so far as I can tell they’re only used in the one potion for the one disease that I only caught once. Might be some tweaking to do on that front.  Or maybe I just haven’t noticed what other recipes need moths, because updates to recipes were a big… and I will say somewhat understated relative to how much changed… part of the patch.  You need to go out at night to harvest.  There are some plants that only come out at night and some mobs that only drop things in the dark. These guys just die when the sun comes up… no loot either Night became a requirement, so I had to go into the server settings and balance out the day/night cycle.  Day is still about 40% longer than night, but night now lasts a good long time. That didn’t turn out to be as much of a hit as I thought it might be.  Night starts off pretty dark, but as the moon gets higher in the sky… and it is always a full moon… the land becomes fairly well lit.  The lighting is more so in open fields and out in the desert, where it isn’t far off from daylight at times.  And down in the shroud… well, I noted in a previous post that the updated shroud is both under a deeper gloom but also better lit once you’re in there.  As such, we have gotten kind of used to just running off to do things in the middle of the night. Running off somewhere without waiting for day again Torches and glowing weapons are nice in the dark, but a key new item in the game is a ring you can find that provides light brighter than a torch and which doesn’t go away when you’re doing something like climbing a grating or something else where light remains a desirable thing. We haven’t thoroughly explored the night yet.  Night temples are still on our list of things to do.  We have found a couple… but it always seems to be daylight.  Also, you need some special items to get in. We’ll get to night temples at some point But being out and about more at night does let us see the game in a different… well… lack of light. The glowing red shroud lava with a new creature And, as I noted, our base feels warm and invitingly lit in the darkness of the night. Our expanding base I’ll have to get into our base in another post, though I will say that this time around we started from scratch in an empty field rather than taking over an existing set of buildings.",
