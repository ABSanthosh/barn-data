In all fairness, a few of these deals are slightly higher than the best deals we saw during Prime Day (by slightly I mean by about $10-$20), however those deals have since expired and I don't think we'll see better pricing until Black Friday.Bose Summer Sale: 25% Off Refurbished ItemsBose Summer Sale: 25% off Certified Refurbished Headphones, Earbuds, Soundbars, and SpeakersI've broken out some of the more notable discounts below. Note that the coupon takes off an additional 25% off on top of already existing discounts that you get for buying a certified refurbished model. The combined discounts total up to 47% off in some cases. That's very steep considering you're getting the same warranty as purchasing brand new.Bose QuietComfort Ultra HeadphonesBose QuietComfort Ultra Noise Canceling Wireless HeadphonesThe QuietComfort Ultra is Bose's newest noise-cancelling headphone, released in late 2023. It is a significant upgrade over the standard QuietComfort headphones in audio and noise-cancelling performance and is easily comparable to other current heavyweights like the Sony WH-1000XM5/XM6 and the AirPods Max. The Ultra features redesigned ear cushions that are both more comfortable and provide a more secure seal, resulting in better passive noise isolation. It also supports spatial audio for better immersion, and it's updated with the new Bluetooth 5.3 protocol. Android users can rejoice in the fact that the Ultra supports Snapdragon Sound, a feature that offers optimized sound quality, connection stability, and latency for your streaming audio when the headphone is connected to an Android device.Bose QuietComfort Ultra EarbudsBose QuietComfort Ultra Noise Canceling EarbudsIf you use an Android smartphone, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds is a better pair of earbuds than the AirPods Pro 2. This is Bose's top-end earbuds, with better noise canceling than the QuietComfort Ultra over-ear headphone due to its sealed in-ear design and better passive noise isolation. Of course the earbuds also boast top notch audio quality to match. Like the Ultra headphones, the earbuds support Snapdragon Sound when paired with an Android device.Bose QuietComfort Ultra Open EarbudsBose Ultra Open Earbuds (Not Noise Canceling)The Ultra Open earbuds is for people who don't want any type of noise isolation, be it passive or active. These earbuds site just outside your ear canal, thus leaving them completely unimpeded. These are a great pair of earbuds for situations where you need to be aware of your surroundings, for example if you're jogging on the streets, taking a fitness class that involves listening to a training instructor, or working at home whilst keeping an ear open for your kids. It's definitely a more niche type of earbuds, so make sure you know exactly what you want if you opt for this model.Bose QuietComfort HeadphonesBose QuietComfort Noise Canceling HeadphonesThe Bose QuietComfort is just a rename of the QuietComfort 45. Aside from the name and a few different color choices, they are the same headphone. The QuietComfort features excellent sound and noise cancelling performance for its price. They're close in quality to Bose's flagship headphone, which is nearly double the price. The QuietComfort is comfortable to wear and has been updated with faster USB Type-C charging, a longer 24-hour battery life on a single charge, and an \"Aware\" mode that lets you listen in on your surroundings.Bose Smart Ultra SoundbarBose Smart Ultra SoundbarThis is Bose's highest end soundbar and normally retails for $1,000 brand new. The soundbar measures 41\" long and contains a 5.1.2ch setup with Bose TrueSpace technology, including two upward firing dipole speakers for Dolby Atmos. Popular amongst soundbars nowaways, \"A.I. Dialogue Mode\" is a feature that automatically balances voice and surround sound so that you don't need to turn up the volume to deafening levels in order to hear what everyone is saying onscreen.Which Bose headphones are best for you?The best Bose headphones offer exceptional sound quality through a range of in-ear and over-ear headphones.
