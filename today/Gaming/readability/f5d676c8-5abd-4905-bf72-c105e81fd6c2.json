The Steam Summer Sale 2025 This is the part where I go on about how the summer and winter sales have long since lost the feeling of uniqueness that drove people to binge buy bargains and have, according to some doomsayers, simply set the bar for video game pricing lower, as anybody who doesn’t have to have a new title on day one is incentivized to wait for the inevitable sale on Steam. And they are not exactly wrong.  But the argument was always that you could get your hardcore fans on day one at full price, then as time went on you could get the undecided to buy in at a lower price, a reduced price transaction being better than no transaction at all. Anyway, here we are.  It is time to go check my Steam wishlist to see what is on discount and if the discount is sufficient that I might actually press the Buy button. I have a general rule of removing anything from the wishlist that lingers for more than five years.  There comes a point where you just have to admit that no price is going to get you to buy.  The only things allowed to go beyond the five year mark are titles that haven’t shipped yet… and even those are just there for comedy I suppose. As for the site itself… well, it is hardly a Steam sale if there isn’t something at least a bit amiss.  For whatever reason initially the deep discounts page was telling you it was the Steam Spring Sale still. The Steam Spring Sale… from March 2025 Also, there were not any deep discounts to be seen.  Eventually that got updated… you can blame me for hitting the site at 10:02… and discounts were visible. The page of 90-95% discounts So there we go.  The Steam Summer Sale is off and running.  Now to see if there is anything that might tempt me. Of course, if you want older titles and even more low prices, the GoG.com Summer Sale is still going on as well.",
