The shred’s not dead, and it’s time to prove it. Dust off your trucks and get ready for Tony Hawk’s™ Pro Skater™ 3 + 4, launching July 11 on PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC (Battle.net, Steam, Microsoft PC Store). Play it on day one with Game Pass. Developed by Iron Galaxy Studios, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 brings remakes of all the original parks plus new ones like Waterpark, Pinball, and Movie Studio. A stacked roster of new and returning skaters represent a killer lineup, including OG legends like Tony Hawk and Bob Burnquist and a new generation of skaters from Rayssa Leal to Yuto Horigome. With a robust Career Mode, cross-platform multiplayer*, enhanced creation tools, New Game+, and more, you can bet on an endless roll of epic skate sessions. Now let’s take a look at some of the highlights awaiting you: Two New Park Reveals: Pinball, Movie Studio Skate across remakes of all the original parks plus three new ones: Waterpark, Pinball, and Movie Studio. Following our Waterpark reveal in March, here’s a closer look at Pinball and Movie Studio. Pinball Drop into the Skate of the Living Dead pinball machine during an active game being played by none other than Tony Hawk himself. Watch out for the silver pinball flying over the board as the birdman aims for a high score. Catch air off pop bumpers, grind the network of wire rails positioned above the playfield, and watch for chomping alligators down the dangerous river. You can always skate into the scoop to transport to the mausoleum above, setting up the perfect run to light up the backbox display with your sickest combo.  For a closer look, check out our Pinball park preview. Movie Studio Make your cinematic debut in Movie Studio, a new competition park set in and around Stage 34. Skate around green screens near sci fi props like a beaming spaceship and the tentacles of a cosmic creature. The track running through Stage 34 and Avenue C provides a consistent floor grind with access to further rails and ramps near the crash site and by the digital ramp displaying an alien landscape. Perfect your runs in Free Skate to help up your score when competing here in the Career Tour. In competitions, each participant skates three one-minute heats, the sum of your best two heats representing your final score. Land in the top three to finish with a medal. Prepare for the epic scenes ahead by studying up on our Movie Studio park preview. Skater Reveals: Michelangelo, Bam Margera Michelangelo Always ready to join the party, TMNT’s Michelangelo escapes Splinter’s prying eyes in a trip out of the sewers. Shred in the name of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and show these humans how it’s done. Cowabunga!  Bam Margera Hailing from West Chester, Pennsylvania, former pro skateboarder, stunt performer, television personality, and filmmaker Bam Margera was first revealed at THPS Fest, a fan of the game and featured skater in multiple titles. There’s no ramp or grind too gnarly for Bam, making him the perfect skater for pulling off the most daring tricks. Keep Shredding in New Game+ Take everything you’ve learned and push it to the next level in New Game+! Retain the stats you earned in your first playthrough while tackling legacy goals from classic games and new objectives like Pro Goals and Expert Challenges. Pro Goals added to every park include striving for the Platinum Score, executing complex environmental tricks, and collecting C-O-M-B-O, a challenge similar to S-K-A-T-E with the requirement that you collect all the letters in one fell swoop. Plus, take on Expert Challenges, testing your skate mastery with speedruns, score challenges, gap combos, and more. Solo Tours: Take what you’ve learned into Solo Tours. Replay the Career as each skater on the roster. The challenge has never been greater, as you’ll have to complete all base and Pro Goals in each level, with more cash, new tricks, and new S-K-A-T-E letter placements depending on your skater’s style to keep things fresh. Multiplayer: Cross-Platform, Private, Local Trade tricks and compete for glory in cross-platform online multiplayer supporting up to eight skaters at once across a variety of game modes including the new HAWK mode. Search for public lobbies or keep it to just your friends with Private Match support. And when the competition’s personal, compete shoulder to shoulder in Local Multiplayer supporting split screen play. Play the new HAWK Mode It’s skateboarding Hide and Seek! During the hide phase, participants skate the chosen map, dropping the individual letters spelling H-A-W-K along the way. Drop the H along a hard-to-reach grind, the A at the apex of a sky-high aerial… use your park knowledge and get creative in placing the four letters. In the seeking phase, each skater must collect their opponent’s letters before the timer runs out. Earn bonus points if any of your letters remain. The highest score after three rounds wins. And the Classics: Chill in Multiplayer Free Skate and compete in returning favorites including the modes listed below, with additional local multiplayer support for Horse and Tag. Adjust time and score limits, choose the park, and shred. Trick Attack: Highest score at the end of a set time limit. Score Challenge: First to hit the target score wins. Combo Mambo: Nail the biggest combo before time runs out. Combo Challenge: First to land the target combo score. Graffiti: Land tricks to tag the most objects on the map. Quality of Life Features Voice Chat: Toggle Voice Chat on or off with a Push to Talk feature for comms at the press of a button. Choose between the All Lobby and Party Only voice channels and set the voice chat level to your preferred volume. Streamer Mode: Skip music tracks not suitable for content creation, replaced with a variety of original tracks that can be added to the overall playlist even after leaving Streamer Mode. Create-A-Park Make your dream park and share it with other skaters in Create-A-Park, a skating sandbox giving you the tools to get creative with dozens of objects and obstacles including dynamic content and custom goals that bring your park to life. Share your creations and play and rate other players’ parks. Skate community favorites in the featured section and share parks across platforms.  A series of helpful tips including video demonstrations make the building and editing process an easy one to pick up even for newcomers.  Custom Goals Give visitors to your new park a challenge using custom goals that merge seamlessly into the environment. Place the letters spelling out S-K-A-T-E, set High Score and Smash goals, look for the perfect nook to stow away the Secret Tape, and more. New Gameplay Objects Choose from a ton of skateable pieces to place and snap together. Place quarter pipes, ramps, fun boxes, pools, floors, rails, decorations, props, and landmarks, each category featuring up to a dozen or more options creating a near limitless variety of park designs. Lay down an airplane, a pagoda, or a fountain made for grinding. Incorporate dynamic props that can be knocked around the map, and more. If you can skate it, there’s a way to make it. Specials: Up your park’s interactivity with NPCs (friendly and aggressive), boost ramps and pads, turbo pads, pits, and even music blocks that strike leads, chords, or percussion on contact. Turbo pad into a boost quarter pipe? Get ready to fly. Smart Pieces: Get it just right with smart pieces, objects that can be edited via easy-to-use interface points to bend and morph the obstacle into something truly unique to your park. Pick a Theme: Looking for the right vibe? Choose from several different themes based on parks in Career Mode like Waterpark, San Francisco, and Skater Island. Keep a consistent look to your park while offering a totally new way to shred in the environment.
