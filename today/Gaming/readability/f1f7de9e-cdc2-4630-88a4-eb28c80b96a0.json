The prize is coming not from defeating the Lich King, but from the Cache of Timewarped Treasures quest reward earned by doing the Timewalking version of another Wrath of the Lich King raid, Ulduar.To snag the quest, players need to travel to the Wrath of the Lich King version of Dalaran (easily accessible from each faction's portal room) and pick up the Disturbance Detected: Ulduar quest from the NPCs standing near the fountain with the statues. Players can then use the Group Finder function to find a group running the old raid. Thankfully, only the raid's final boss needs to be defeated for the quest, so players can actually skip most of the raid and run straight to Yogg-Saron to save time.Players are sharing their success on the WoW subreddit. While it's unclear what exactly the drop rate for Invincible from the Cache of Timewarped Treasures is, it clearly seems to be much higher than defeating the Lich King like usual.Blizzard recently announced The War Within's first major update, patch 11.0.5, will release on October 22. The update will introduce a huge WoW 20th-anniversary event--one where players will be able to earn updated versions of some of the game's most iconic armor sets, complete Timewalking versions of old dungeons and raids, and more.
