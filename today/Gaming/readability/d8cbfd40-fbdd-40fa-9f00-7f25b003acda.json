  "text": "Blu-rays, and Waldo, and books, oh my!Prime Day has come and gone, and while there are still some stragglers from last week's huge sale, Barnes \u0026 Noble is currently the place to go for great deals on books and movies. Similar to Amazon's Criterion Collection Blu-ray sale, you can select from a wide catalogue of available movies to bundle and save. Everything included is 50% off, so if you love physical media and classic films this is the sale for you. There are also tons of books currently buy 1, get 1 50% off. You can get the entire Harry Potter saga in paperback, romance books, and even Where's Waldo (if you can find him). Barnes \u0026 Noble Has Tons of Physical Media On SaleAbove is a TL;DR of everything available in this sale. Some of the promotions end this week, while others last into the beginning of August. 50% off the Criterion Collection movies50% off the Criterion CollectionThe Criterion Collection is an initiative to restore and re-release important classic and contemporary films. Barnes \u0026 Noble's 50% off sale is a gold mine of these movies, and I've picked out some of my personal recommendations I think would be great additions to any cinephiles collections. First you have Anora, a Sean Baker film from last year that took home several Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actress for Mikey Madison as the title character. Then there's the Irishman, a classic Martin Scorsese period gangster flick that I don't feel gets enough recognition (It's almost four hours long, but I promise it's incredible). Finally, I'd check out the Sound of Metal, a sort-of cautionary tale on ignoring health issues that has a nice self-acceptance theme as well.Buy 1, get 1 50% booksOf course, it wouldn't be Barnes \u0026 Noble without a vast selection of books. They have dozens of Where's Waldo books for kids, romance books, Harry Potter, and more for a nice buy one, get one half-off deal. You can get all seven of the Harry Potter books for a significantly lower price if you're picking them all up for the first time, and you can even get the 20th anniversary edition covers for the same price. Romance novels are as popular as ever it seems, thanks to BookTok. The Things We Leave Unfinished by Rebecca Yarros is a solid pick up. And for those with little ones, Where's Waldo books (today I learned these are still around) are only $8.99 each and qualify for this promotion.Does Barnes \u0026 Noble Have Free Shipping?Barnes \u0026 Noble does have free shipping, but according to the help page, it is only for orders of $40 or more as long as the item isn't \"unusually sized or overweight.\" You also have to make sure you choose \"standard shipping\" as the option when checking out. Alternatively, you can choose to order online and pick up in-store if you have a location near you. You can take advantage of the online Barnes \u0026 Noble store finder to see your closest option.Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.
