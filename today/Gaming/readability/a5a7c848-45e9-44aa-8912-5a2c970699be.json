  "text": "Best Buy just kicked off an Early Black Friday Sale lasting through Sunday, November 10. There are hundreds of products listed but only a handful of them are what I would consider \"Black Friday\" caliber. Some of these show the lowest prices we've seen all year and are unlikely to drop further on Black Friday. We've sorted them by category and broken out individual deals that we think are the cream of the crop so you can browse in one place. It's also worth noting Best Buy offers free shipping on most orders over $35, and there's usually an option to pick up in-store. And, since you'd be shopping ahead of Black Friday, you'll avoid the crowds.What's the top deal so far from Best Buy?SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless HeadsetIf you're looking for a wireless gaming headset with swappable batteries, the SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless gaming headset is your best bet – now at the lowest price you'll find. Best Buy just dropped 50% off this headset, now only $139.99 shipped. The packaging mentions only PS4 and PC compatibility, however SteelSeries has confirmed PS5 compatibility. The only other wireless headset with swappable batteries is the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro, and we've never seen that model sell for under $250.Early Black Friday LEGO DealsAt Best Buy, there are also LEGO sets on sale, but most LEGO deals are reserved for Best Buy Plus and Total members. The Plus and Total memberships are paid subscriptions, so unless you're already a member, I'd recommend waiting for these deals until Black Friday because Best Buy will eventually make them available to everyone.However, we did find the deals which don't require a membership and are worth buying ahead of time, especially if you're anxious to shop now. The LEGO Icons Corvette is only on sale at Best Buy and it's set to retire very soon. The LEGO Advent Calendars are also worth buying sooner than later before they sell out, and to secure them in-hand before December 1. They are popular gifts and go out of stock quickly (the LEGO Star Wars and LEGO City Advent Calenders are gone).For more LEGO Black Friday deals, check out Target's own Early Black Friday sale, with some discounts on different LEGO sets. Target's exclusive Shadow the Hedgehog is already on sale even though it was released very recently.Early Black Friday Gaming Peripheral DealsThere are a couple of Best Buy exclusive deals on SteelSeries gaming headsets, some higher end gaming monitors from LG and Samsung, and the Logitech G923 gaming wheels for both the PS5 and Xbox Series X.Early Black Friday Sony Headphone DealsThe Sony headphone and earbud deals have started early for Black Friday. These are manufacturer discounts, so the discounted pricing should be available at other retailers if you prefer them, like Amazon, Walmart, or Target. The Sony WH1000XM5 is currently our favorite noise cancelling headphone. In our IGN 9/10 rated Sony WH-1000XM5 review, Kevin Lee wrote that \"the Sony WH-1000XM5 is hands down the best sounding and most impressive noise-canceling headphones around. They demand a high premium but the cost of audio excellence is well worth it.\"Early Black Friday Gaming Laptops and PCsThere are already some great deals on gaming laptops and PCs at Best Buy. These are prebuilt systems that ship out immediately. Score an RTX 4070 gaming laptop for as low as $1199.99 or an RTX 4070 Super gaming PC for only $1499.99.For more early Black Friday deals on gaming laptops and PCs, check out both the Dell Early Black Friday Sale and the HP Early Black Friday Sale for a greater selection and potentially deeper discounts. These computers are made-to-order and usually take longer to ship out, but the consistency in build quality and customer service makes them worth it.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
