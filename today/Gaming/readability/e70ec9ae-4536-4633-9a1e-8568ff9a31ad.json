  "text": "It doesn't cut corners either. Image credit: RPS Photo Composite / HP There's a new king of RTX 5080 laptop deals, and it's this HP Omen Max 16 configuration. At $2,609.99 shipped with promo code PC10DEAL, it undercuts the competition by hundreds of dollars without compromising on power. Inside is a top-end Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX and NVIDIA RTX 5080 GPU—parts usually found in laptops closer to $3,500. It's the lowest price we've seen on a 5080-equipped machine, and it holds up surprisingly well across the board. Still, if you're just after a decent 5080 rig, then you might be better off considering this monster deal at Dell right now on the Alienware Aurora, down to $2205 with relevant discount codes. Purely on money spent, it's a better offer. Although, if a gaming laptop is what you're after, the HP Omen Max 16 is more than capable. This model replaces the older Omen 16 with a chunkier design and much better thermals. That cooling system matters—it's working overtime to keep pace with the Core Ultra 9 275HX, which currently sits at the top of PassMark's laptop CPU leaderboard. Compared to AMD's Ryzen 9 7945HX3D, it holds a 7% edge in performance. It's not slim or subtle, but it's built for pure gaming power. Then there's the RTX 5080. This isn't just a refresh of the 4080—it's around 15–20% faster and even manages to outpace the mobile 4090 by roughly 5% in most real-world benchmarks. That's impressive considering the premium on RTX 5090 laptops. Paired with the QHD+ display and DLSS 4 support, you're looking at high frame rates across almost any modern title. Compare this to something like the Razer Blade 16, and the value becomes clear. Razer's RTX 5080 model starts at $3,499.99. That's nearly $900 more for similar performance. Razer's hardware is undeniably sleek, but if your goal is performance per dollar, HP wins easily. Why you might still go with a Razer Blade 16 There are still good reasons to opt for Razer's Blade 16. The chassis is machined from a single block of aluminum with Apple-tier build quality. It's thinner, lighter, and far more refined overall. If portability and presentation matter to you, that makes a real difference. Razer's vapor chamber cooling isn't just marketing either. It's vacuum-sealed and liquid-filled, keeping thermals in check despite the slim design. It's a clever engineering solution that prevents throttling without making the system bulky. And then there's the OLED display. It's standard on Razer's newer 2025 lineup, with options for QHD+ resolution and high refresh rates. Visuals are crisp, contrast is deep, and response times are lightning quick. If you value screen quality just as much as raw performance, Razer pulls ahead here. So yes, you're paying more. About $3,499.99 for the RTX 5080 version to be exact. But you're also getting a beautifully built machine that's lighter, quieter, and arguably more portable. If you want power and polish in one, and don't mind paying extra for it, Razer makes a strong case.",
