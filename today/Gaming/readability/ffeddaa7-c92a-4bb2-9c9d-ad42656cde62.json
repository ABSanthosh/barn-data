One of these is a large hotdog. Remember that Roblox is, on paper at least, a kid’s game. So you can probably guess why the hotdog has been removed and replaced with a cupcake. (People were making dick outfits.) Suggested ReadingWhy You'll Fall In Love With This Indie Horror Romance MashupOffEnglishSuggested ReadingReleased last year, Dress To Impress has quickly become one of the most popular Roblox experiences on the platform. In fact, it’s one of the most popular games in the world right now. Seriously. I randomly checked how many people were playing it on Wednesday afternoon and over 301,000 people were playing the dress-up game at the same time. That would make it the third-most popular game on Steam. And based on some recent messages from folks who work on DTI, it seems a lot of those people were using the hotdog costume to make penises. On October 22, Dress To Impress community manager Beaplays confirmed on Twitter that the hotdog costume had been “temporarily” removed from the game due to “inappropriate usage.” It seems some folks were changing the hotdog to a flesh color and popping a pink or brown hat on top to create an outfit that looked a lot like a penis. “Just an update in case you haven’t already seen. The hotdog costume will be temporarily removed from DTI due to inappropriate usage. We plan to bring it back later with limitations on how you can color it/couple it with other items to reduce this,” posted the community manager. They also confirmed a new cupcake costume has now been added to Dress To Impress. The hotdog is planned to return with more restrictions in November and when it returns the devs will try to make it so people can still create the Duolingo Owl mascot. Not the first time Dress To Impress players were warnedFunnily enough, the community was warned about this already. On October 21, the day before the digital wiener was removed, DTI’s development manager said that the devs had noticed people using the hotdog costume to create naughty outfits. So they removed the option for people to change its color and said that if the hotdog continued to be “misused” it would be removed. “We want to create a safe and friendly environment for our players and it was not intended to be used this way,” said the manager. “Creativity is the point of the game, and we see a lot of tweets that prove that. But, we just can’t give other outlets to something this serious. We love all of your creativity with it (besides the reasons we are removing it..) but it’s better for us and for the community just to end it ASAP” But this is the internet and if you give people the ability to create digital dicks, they’ll do it and keep doing it until either you stop them or they get bored. We shall see how long the hotdog will stick around when it returns. I’m going to say about two days.",
