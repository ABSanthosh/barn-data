  "text": "Magic Cats Pots is a cosy puzzle game where you need to put broken objects (each with a feline-themed design) back together. I am big into playing cosy games with my daughter, Robin, on Saturday mornings. There is just something about being up early and enjoying a slow game that’s like coffee on a beautiful dawn. This time, she picked out Magic Cats Pots from our collection, which is a puzzle game about putting together broken objects. You will repair a variety of different objects across its chapters: mugs, bowls, jars, kettles, etc. You will start off with mugs and then slowly work your way onto the next item once you have fixed all of the mugs. These objects are extremely charming in the way they look, often with hidden images or large pictures of cats on them. Putting them together is as easy as finding where the pieces line up and rotating them around until they connect. In the first difficulty mode, Cosy, you can easily get through a bunch of the items. Once you have put them back together, you will get to see an end screen and a star ranking. You will get one one star for completing the game in Cosy, but you can go back to that specific pot in the book of levels, and select it on Medium (which unlocks after Cosy) and then Hard (which unlocks after Medium) to get all of the stars. The medium and hard puzzles are much more challenging, but you can hit a button to see what the full item should look like (which does help). Some of the items in Magic Cats Pots actually animate, offering a bit of movement after you have completed them. This does indeed feel quite magical! There are plenty of levels to keep you busy and it’s calm enough to keep you in a relaxed mode (unless you want to take on more of a challenge in Medium and Hard). Magic Cats Pots is available now on the Nintendo eShop, Microsoft Store, and Steam.
