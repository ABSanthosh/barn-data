  "text": "Image credit: Eurogamer June is here, which means Amazon has refreshed its Prime Gaming offerings for another month, and - following a bumper-packed May - it's a comparatively quiet one this time around. In total, June brings nine new games for subscribers to download, including Thief: Deadly Shadows. As usual, Prime Gaming's June additions arrive across four scheduled content drops, and the first of these is available to claim right now. Point yourself in the direction of Amazon's website and you're able to grab tactical turn-based Games Workshop adaptation Mordheim: City of the Damned, as well as retro-inspired point-and-click sci-fi adventure The Abandoned Planet. Then, as June trundles onwards and summer vaguely threatens to emerge, members can look forward to the likes of Thief: Deadly Shadows, the third game in the classic stealth series, and minimalist railway puzzler Station to Station. That's alongside the acclaimed Jupiter Hell, a grimy top-down turn-based sci-fi shooter, plus guns-and-sorcery cRPG Dark Envoy. You'll find the full list of Junes's titles (plus the digital stores they can be grabbed from) below. Available now: Mordheim: City of the Damned [GOG] The Abandoned Planet [Amazon Games App] 12th June Station to Station [Amazon Games App] Death Squared [GOG] 19th June Dark Envoy [GOG] FATE: Undiscovered Realms [GOG] 26th June Thief: Deadly Shadows [GOG] Jupiter Hell [GOG] Gallery of Things: Reveries [Legacy Games Code] In addition to the above, Prime Gaming subscribers in the UK, US, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, the Netherlands, and Poland get the usual access to a rotating selection of titles via Amazon's cloud gaming service, Luna. In June, these include Batman: Arkham Knight, Lego DC Super-Villains, House of Golf 2, RiMS Racing, Mail Mole, Garfield Kart - Furious Racing, The Jackbox Survey Scramble, Ultrakill, Spells \u0026 Secrets, and Qube 10th Anniversary. Those are available alongside Luna regulars Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition, Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition, Fortnite, and Trackmania.",
