The imposing LEGO Super Mario The Mighty Bowser 71411 set is currently on sale for $219. As of this moment, this deal is exclusive to Walmart and doesn't seem to be an official part of Prime Day (it's still $270 on Amazon). The Mighty Bowser has been in production since October of 2022, so this set is expected to be retired within the next year.20% Off the LEGO Super Mario The Mighty Bowser 71411LEGO Super Mario The Mighty Bowser 71411The Mighty Bowswer is still the largest LEGO x Nintendo collaboration with a total of 2,807 brick pieces. The finished build measures 16 inches wide and 12.5 inches tall. Kevin Wong built this actual set and loved it. It's both scary and adorable at the same time. It treats adult LEGO builders to a challenging build with advanced techniques and yet it is also durable enough to be interacted with, without fear of limbs falling apart. It brings out the best of both LEGO and Nintendo. Kevin wrote that \"It is as perfect a merging as one could have hoped for. Ideally, this would be the first in a series of 'third path' sets that will recreate the gameplay and characters from our childhoods. And not just for Mario either. What about Zelda? Or Metroid? Or Pokemon? The possibilities are endless.\"More LEGO Sets on Sale for Prime DayMighty Bowser isn't the only set currently on sale for Amazon Prime Day. Check out these other adult-themed sets from Walmart, Amazon, and even the LEGO Shop, including the Milk Way Galaxy, the LEGO Technic BMW M 1000 RR Motorcycle or the LEGO Icons Land Rover Classic Defender 90, which is expected to be retired later this year.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
