  "text": "As Spring Sale gets underway. Image credit: Eurogamer/The Gentlebros Spring is officially here and the Epic Games Store is celebrating the occassion with a two-week long, seasonally appropriate Spring Sale. But bargain hunters can also pick up Epic's latest selection of free weekly games, which are available to download now. As is customary, Epic latest freebies are available for seven days - starting today, 27th March, and continuing until next Thursday, 3rd April. After which another free title - currently listed as \"mystery game\" - will take over. Notably, clues suggests there's a bit of a cat theme for the duration of this year's Spring Sale, given the feline wrapping paper currently obscuring next week's title, and the two free games available right now: Cat Quest Neko Ghost, Jump! Cat Quest Trailer Cat Quest trailer, if you're wondering what it looks like.Watch on YouTube Cat Quest, if you're unfamiliar, is the first game in developer The Gentlebros' now three-strong casual action-RPG series. It's a lot of fun too, taking everything you'd ordinarily expect to find in an action-RPG - real-time combat, dungeon crawling, equipment progression, and so on - and turning it into a breezy, super-streamlined, pick-up-and-play package. It also has more cat puns than is probably legal, and you can grab it for free here. I'm less familiar with Neko Ghost, Jump!, but a quick bit of investigatory Googling reveals it to be a puzzle platformer that sees players switching between 2D and 3D perspectives as they attempt to navigate its 40+ stages. It's the work of developer Burgos Games, contains a further multitude of cats, and can be downloaded for free on Epic here. To recap, you've gone seven days from today, 27th March, to add Epic's latest weekly freebies to your Epic Games Store library, after which they'll make way for something new. And if you do head over to Epic's digital storefront, you'll find the Spring Sale is also currently underway. This runs until 9th April, and promises up to 75 percent off selected games.",
