These portable fans wrap around your head and are a simple and effective way to keep your noggin cool and breezy. If you're not sure whether a neck fan is worth it for you, at least you can give it a try with minimal risk. Right now Amazon is offering 50% off Tunise Rechargeable Portable Neck Fans with coupon code \"8Z2BHHVD\". For Amazon Prime members, prices start at just $13.50 after the code is applied. To be honest, most of these inexpensive neck fans on Amazon look like they came from the same factory, so it really just comes down to finding the lowest price. Also, if you don't like it, Amazon offers an easy 30 day return policy.Tunise Rechargeable Portable Neck Fan for $13.49Amazon Prime Members Get Bigger DiscountsTunise Rechargeable Portable Neck FanThe Tunise portable neck fan comes in twelve different colors and styles, although prices and availability vary. It features brushless motors that can spin a pair of tiny fans built into each earcup at up to 4,100RPM. The rechargeable battery lasts from three to ten hours on a single charge depending on which of the three fan speeds you select. Tunise advertises its neck fan as \"whisper quiet\" although that would probably depend on the speed setting.A portable neck fan has plenty of practical uses, especially if you're going somewhere hot and humid (like Disney World Orlando in the summer). For gamers, it makes a lot of sense because your room can get pretty toasty on a hot day, especially with your gaming console or PC working overtime and exhausting tons of hot air. Additionally, if you're like me and you get sweaty whenever you wear a gaming headset, a neck fan could be the perfect solution for that too.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
