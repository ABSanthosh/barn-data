  "text": "Anyone familiar with Atlus’s deep and involving role-playing games has been eager to see what the strange and magical Metaphor: ReFantazio has in store. And while it’s not directly connected to the popular Persona series, there are some intriguing touchstones across its aesthetics and mechanics to hook fans and newcomers alike. Let’s take a close look at some of these intriguing similarities and differences ahead of the October 11 release date. Combat is unleashed Fans of Persona’s fast-paced yet detailed turn-based combat will find themselves at home here, but Studio Zero has given it a little twist, too. You can engage in real-time combat with low level enemies, taking them out with a handful of targeted strikes or even a single blow if your current level totally outclasses them. There’s a dedicated dodge button to avoid their attacks if they see you before you can act, which is also handy for foes which are too tough to take out in real-time. In which case, you can initiate a turn-based battle after you’ve softened them up with an action strike – especially handy if you can catch an enemy off-guard first, giving you a free hit during the turn-based Squad Battle. Real-time combat can be used to any monster’s advantage, too. During one instance I thought some vicious beasts were blocked by some barrels, but they smashed right through them, initiated the Squad Battle, and got a free hit on my party in the process. Lesson learned – I used the protagonist’s Fae Sight a lot more often from that point to be more aware of nearby enemies and have Gallica assess their threat levels. But if things are going really badly, you can also press L3 to restart the battle. Time management is key As the game’s main plot develops, one of your aims becomes balancing tasks through the day to gain democratic popularity while completing other objectives to become more powerful, creating bonds with other party members or hitting certain story milestones. As in Persona, each of these consume time as you creep towards specific events, and not meeting deadlines for critical ones results in a game over. So mapping out each day, knowing when to enter time-consuming dungeons and when to rest – or even kill time by doing more peaceful tasks – can make all the difference. Thankfully, all activities are clearly denoted with how much time they eat up, so you shouldn’t be caught off guard.  Exploring the United Kingdom of Euchronia Metaphor: ReFantazio wastes no time establishing that we’re not on our Earth… or in a particularly safe land. The game’s inciting incident comes from a savage act of regicide, and things only get wilder from there with its medieval fantasy setting exploring themes of bigotry and the value of imagination, especially when overcoming our own fears and anxieties. Humans are far from human In fact, the term ‘human’ in the game is synonymous with often giant, grotesque monsters feared by the varied fantasy races of the game. Even our blue-haired protagonist – who arguably looks the closest to a traditional Persona character – is a rarity in a world full of the horned Clemar Tribe, elven looking Roussainte Tribe, fairies, and many other species. The music is more operatic Persona is known for its eclectic range of tunes, from rock to acid jazz to electronic inspired beats. Given its setting, Metaphor: ReFantazio soundtrack leans towards the more orchestral, with tense strings, dramatic drums, and chants present in its wonderfully composed battle themes that are already subject to deservedly flattering memes. Fans of the parent series, Shin Megami Tensei, might find their toes tapping in its sweeping tonal familiarity. Less summoning or fusing, more transforming While Metaphor: ReFantazio’s powerful Archetype forms are similar toPersona’s summoning system, there are some notable differences. Archetypes are typically awakened when a party member confronts and overcomes a certain fear or anxiety, causing them to tap into a magical armored form capable of enhanced attacks and abilities. These transformed figures are part of a job system where your party members can switch between the 40+ differently skilled Archetypes, spread across 14 different lineages to suit your playstyle. For example, despite which characters you have in your party, you can put together a Saviour from the Healer lineage, a Ninja Thief and a Devil Summoner. Or a Magic Knight, Dragoon Gunner and Martial Artist Brawler. And with them create combos in battle via spectacular Synthesis Skills. Exploring a safe haven It isn’t long in the game before you’re transported to the mysterious Akademeia, by the equally mysterious More. This magical library is a spirit home where you can learn about Archetypes via books and lectures, and unlock additional aspects of their abilities. Initially you’ll not have much choice in going to Akademeia, but as the game progresses, you’ll be able to choose when you visit via the protagonist’s novel or More’s ghostly figure. There’s much More to Akademeia than first appears While acting as an enemy-free hub to study and grow, Akademeia also gives space for Metaphor: ReFantazio to delve into the tale’s meta commentary, examining the power of imagination and the nature of storytelling. Without giving too much away, this is also tied to one of your very first acts in the game, where you as the player type in your own name. Oh, and there’s also a cute cat you can pet… which I often did. Priorities, right?    Persona’s not the only one with style Sure, you might have played medieval fantasy RPGs before, but have you played one as stylish as this? From its anime cutscenes to its fun battle chatter to its slick victory outros, Metaphor: ReFantazio rivals Persona for its sheer sense of flair. The UI also maintains a sense of familiarity without being a direct mimic, opting for a slightly more uniform aesthetic. Similarly, the game knows when to use a bold mixture of colors and when to opt for a more naturalistic palette, delivering an eye-pleasing blend of what we’d expect for a classic fantasy genre without sacrificing the Atlus panache and polish. Your protagonist has a voice Perhaps the most notable aspect of Metaphor: ReFantazio’s cast is that your protagonist is voice acted in the same way the rest of the characters are. Although you can name him whatever you wish, as the bulk of the in-game dialogue is still delivered via text with occasional vocalizations. A union of tribes Tellingly, every party member you develop throughout the game represents each of the main tribes of the land. For example, the stoic knight Hulkenberg is a Roussainte, while the rodent looking Eugief tribe is represented by Heismay, who awakens the thief archetype. And the diminutive but faithful fairy Gallica might not be able to fight, but offers valuable advice and guidance on your journey. Creating bonds with Followers Romantic Persona fans won’t necessarily find the same starry-eyed connections in Metaphor: ReFantazio, but building relationships is still important. At various points you have the opportunity to interact with other party members and NPCs, and spending specific time with them forms a bond. In turn, this can help awaken new Archetypes, with deeper rapports unlocking further abilities. Real life connections help, too Staying online with the game gives you the option to explore the handy Travellers’ Voices page. A press of the Touch Pad shows you what other players have done in the section you’re currently in. So if you’re stuck in a dungeon, you can check out what party formations others have used and what levels they cleared that area with, as well as changing your formation to match another player’s for a better chance of success. Travellers’ Voices also works in towns as well, handily letting you know where players have spent their time most during the day. A nice little feature if you’re looking for a bit of guidance as to how to while away some free time in Euchronia. Rich, constantly surprising and stylishly elegant, Metaphor: ReFantazio is not only a delight for fans of Atlus’s games, but will charm newcomers with its magic, too. If you’ve not already found out for yourself via the PS5 demo, you’ll get the chance when the full game launches October 11 on PS4 and PS5.",
