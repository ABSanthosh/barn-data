  "text": "January 17 will bring Dynasty Warriors: Origins, a thrilling new addition to the Dynasty Warriors series to PlayStation 5, and we recently had the opportunity to play the tactical hack-and-slash action ahead of its release.  The gripping tale of a ‘nameless hero’  Dynasty Warriors: Origins follows the drama surrounding China’s Three Kingdoms period, from the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the Battle of Red Cliffs. At the beginning of the game, the protagonist gets caught up in a battle with Guan Yu against the troops of corrupt officials. The Yellow Turban Rebellion was never portrayed in detail in previous installments of the series. Still, this game goes into depth around the origins and woes of the Yellow Turbans, as well as the perspectives of each general belonging to the defeated troops. The struggle of choosing sides amid a slew of enthralling warriors and heroes The protagonist is a traveling martial artist suffering from amnesia. However, his body still remembers how to handle weapons, allowing him to wield his skills tactfully in every battle. Since he is not loyal to a specific kingdom or sovereign, he can deepen bonds with various forces and join them on the battlefield. However, the protagonist must eventually face a pivotal choice – whether he will serve and support the aspirations of Cao Cao, Suan Jin, or Liu Bei. All three are brilliant warriors, which makes the choice even more difficult.  All three are intriguing, and you will develop special bonds with them throughout the story. Deciding who to support is made all the more difficult since each one will woo you to join their side. After thinking long and hard, I ultimately chose to support Liu Bei, as I had been fighting alongside him since the very beginning of the game. It is a difficult decision since choosing one side means you will have to cross blades with those you once fought with.  An even more exhilarating and gratifying hack-and-slash action In this game, players will not only enjoy the exhilarating ‘1 vs 1,000’ gameplay with easy to learn controls that is characteristic of the Dynasty Warrior series but also large-scale tactical battles that are equally thrilling and rewarding.  As in the previous entries, you can dominate regular enemies by mastering the combo of swift normal attacks and powerful, strong attacks. However, renowned generals and leader-class officers are surrounded by a protective aura called Fortitude, which prevents you from dealing significant damage. To deplete enemy fortitudes, the player must target an opening after an enemy’s attack,  leverage Battles Arts, a set of unique moves available for each weapon, or Parries, a powerful counter that leaves the enemy vulnerable. Dominate your foes with Musou Attacks and Companion attacks Powerful Musou Attacks can be triggered when the Musou Gauge reaches a certain level, and they can eliminate enemies in a wide area. In addition, you can activate War God Rage mode when the Musou Gauge is built up to two levels, as well as the super-powerful True Musou attack. In some battles, you can bring an allied general as your Companion. You can directly control your companions by switching to them and unleashing their unique attacks. You can also trigger the Extreme Musou Attack in tandem with your companion, which is a blast to use.  Experience unprecedented scale as thousands of soldiers clash on the battlefield Dynasty Warriors: Origins takes full advantage of the power of PS5 to realize an unprecedented scale of battle in the series’ history. In some battles, you will witness massive groups of enemies clash on the field, which is a spectacle on its own. Every soldier on the battlefield employs their own strategy, whether under the command of their leaders or with their own volition, causing the state of battle to shift rapidly. The importance of maintaining your troop’s Morale Morale is an important factor during battles. Morale rises when enemy generals are defeated, or you seize enemy strongholds. When morale is high, your soldiers’ powers are bolstered to your advantage, but on the other hand, morale can fall when allied generals are defeated or your strongholds are captured. There were stressful moments when I was needed in multiple places at once, but overcoming those challenges was extremely satisfying.  Command your Bodyguards with strategic Tactics and repel Grand Tactics deployed by Large Forces Dynasty Warrior: Origins will bring back the Bodyguard system. Using Tactics, you can command these bodyguards to perform various actions, such as raining arrows or charging with spears. Also, when a massive number of soldiers gather, a Large Force will be formed. These large forces can deploy Grand Tactics, dramatically shifting the tide of battle. These intense group assaults involve troops charging in one after another with spears or stone throwers firing firebombs. Though these attacks are a spectacle to witness, they’ll inflict significant damage on your allies, so make sure you deal with them swiftly. The story of this latest installment in the series offers a unique perspective into the historical drama from the eyes of a ‘nameless hero,’ and the intense battles and unprecedented scale of the battlefields are gripping and immersive. Dynasty Warriors: Origins is for the die-hard fans of the series, as well as those new to the franchise who are eager to explore the epic tales behind the Three Kingdoms and their heroes. Experience the grand battle on January 17 on PS5. Trending Stories",
