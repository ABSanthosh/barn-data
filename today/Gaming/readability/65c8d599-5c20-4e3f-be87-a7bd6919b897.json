  "text": "\"This agreement shows what's possible when workers stand together and refuse the status quo.\" Image credit: Microsoft The Communications Workers of America (CWA) says it has reached a \"historic tentative contract agreement\" with ZeniMax Media staff at Microsoft. In a statement, the union calls the deal a \"first for the video game industry\", and revealed it had been negotiating for a first contract for \"nearly two years\". \"QA workers from across the country continue to lead the charge for industry-wide change,\" said Page Branson, Senior II QA Tester and ZeniMax Workers United-CWA bargaining committee member. \"Going toe-to-toe with one of the largest corporations in the world isn’t a small feat. This is a monumental victory for all current video game workers and for those that come after.\" Newscast: Xbox currently has more first-party games coming to PlayStation 5 this year than Sony Xbox currently has more first-party games coming to PlayStation 5 this year than Sony.Watch on YouTube The new contract is said to set \"new standards for the industry\" and includes \"substantial across-the-board wage increases as well as new minimum salaries for workers\". It also includes protections against arbitrary dismissal, grievance procedures, and a crediting policy that \"clearly acknowledges the QA workers' contributions to the video games they help create\", as well as a previously announced agreement on how artificial intelligence is introduced and implemented in the workplace. \"Workers in the video game industry are demonstrating once again that collective power works. This agreement shows what's possible when workers stand together and refuse to accept the status quo,\" added CWA President Claude Cummings Jr. \"Whether it's having a say about the use of AI in the workplace, fighting for significant wage increases and fair crediting policies, or protecting workers from retaliation, our members have raised the bar. We're proud to support them every step of the way.\" BREAKING: We have reached a historic first tentative contract agreement with Microsoft! cwa-union.org/news/release...[image or embed]— CWA (@cwaunion.bsky.social) May 30, 2025 at 5:04 PMMembers can expect contract explanation meetings over the next few weeks, and a ratification vote is expected by 20th June. As game development becomes increasingly insecure all over the world, more and more developers and performers are organising collective bargaining. Following news of the SAG-AFTRA strike last year, Equity stated it stood \"in solidarity\", but would not be authorising a strike. It did, however, recently call on the games industry to improve conditions for performers, and a protest took place outside BAFTA Games Awards as Equity members held placards reading \"Union contracts in gaming now\". Last month, the US union warned of \"alarming loopholes\" for \"AI abuse\" in the latest proposal to end industrial action, while earlier this month, almost 200 Overwatch developers working at Activision Blizzard joined the Communications Workers of America (CWA) union after the \"overwhelming majority\" of workers signed up.",
