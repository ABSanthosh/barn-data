It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which would you rather have: an epic eyeshadow collection or an epic lipstick collection? My eye makeup game has been super minimal for the past couple of years, so epic lipstick collection it is! 2. If you could only wear one type of pants for the rest of your life, which would you pick: yoga/workout leggings, jeans, chinos or overalls? Although I like the idea of wearing pants with stretch, I do not love the idea of wearing leggings that hug my butt so closely for the rest of my life. UGH. But I guess I’d go with yoga/workout leggings, simply because I can’t imagine working out in jeans or chinos. And I guess one could dress leggings up for formal occasions? 3.

What do you think would be cooler: having wings or having an impenetrable shell? Wings, all the way. I can see why a shell would be great though, especially if one was unexpectedly under attack, or if people were getting on my nerves and/or I needed to take a nap! Just tuck into the shell and that’s it. 4. What’s for dinner? Probably lemon pasta because we just picked off a ton of lemons from our lemon tree a few days ago, and I need to use them up. I use this recipe, by the way! 5. What’s easier to do, blending blush or blending eyeshadow? Oh yeah, blush, for sure. Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S.
