  "text": "\"Actively witnessing Call of Duty become the Krusty Krab.\" Image credit: Eurogamer / Activision / u/whambampl Eagle-eyed Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 players have spotted a new feature on the weapon selection menu. Right at the top there now sits advertisements promoting premium weapons and skins, so players get exposed to ads for microtransactions in-game. As some players point out, it's not an advert in the classic sense, and no one's trying to flog you a cheeseburger or a pair of jeans every time you swap a weapon. Nonetheless, it's a new and insidious addition that we haven't seen in Call of Duty games before. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Opening Scene and Gameplay (4K) Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Opening Scene and Gameplay (4K).Watch on YouTube \"One of the unwelcome changes I’ve noticed with Season 4 is that they’ve now inserted a new ad spot at the top of the list of your weapon specifics builds,\" wrote one player. \"So now every time you toggle between weapon builds you get to stare at ads for $20-$30 skins. I’m sure the Activision developer who suggested this terrible feature is very proud of themselves. \"This change is especially unneeded because you could already toggle from Builds to Shop on any given weapon and apparently not being thrown directly in our faces didn’t make them enough money. Many of us payed [sic] $60-$100 for a feature game and don’t want to be bombarded with additional ads.\" \"Actively witnessing Call of Duty become [SpongeBob SquarePants'] the Krusty Krab,\" replied another. Season 4 brings new ad spot in game for weapons byu/whambampl inblackops6\"Well guys looks like COD can suck a fat one,\" replied someone else. \"This ad mess is ridiculous. They make huge bank already for them to even do this should be illegal. I've never been done with a COD this fast ever. But she's getting deleted. You can't scrounge people for money and not have a decent game. I'm not asking for a great game, just not a buggy game.\" In a separate thread that's been upvoted almost a thousand times, one player opined: \"I wouldn't even be mad if this was just in warzone, a free game, but putting it in a pay-to-play premium title, with how expensive they're getting?\" \"Agree 100%, it really feels like one of those free cell phone games from a tiny indie studio begging you for money at every turn. Pathetic for a full price, stand alone game from a huge developer,\" replied another. Earlier this year, in a update shared on social media, developer Treyarch said it recognised cheaters \"are frustrating and severely impact the experience for our community\" but insisted it was addressing the issue, and will continue to do so \"throughout 2025\". At the same time, it confirmed 136,000 ranked play accounts were banned for cheating across both Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone.",
