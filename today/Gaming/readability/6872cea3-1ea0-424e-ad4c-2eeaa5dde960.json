  "text": "Image credit: Argonaut Games Fans of developer Argonaut's warmly remembered 3D platformer Croc: Legend of the Gobbos are in for a blast of nostalgia; after a bit of a delay, its previously announced remaster has been given a release date, and is launching for PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch on 2nd April. Croc: Legend of the Gobbos, for the uninitiated (or young), launched for the original PlayStation in 1997, taking players - in the guise of the titular crocodile - on a journey through Gobbo Valley in a bid to free their friends from the evil magician Baron Dante. The resulting adventure wasn't exactly a classic of the genre, but it certainly had fans. And now, Argonaut - which was resurrected last year, 20 years after its original closure - is revisiting Croc's first outing with a nostalgia-tweaking update. It promises \"vibrant high-definition graphics, a modern control and camera system, and refined gameplay mechanics\" as players venture across \"beautifully recrafted\" levels. Croc Legend of the Gobbos coming April 2nd! Croc: Legend of the Gobbos release date trailer.Watch on YouTube That's alongside the addition of a Crocipedia - a \"painstakingly curated\" digital museum charting the original game's development through design documents, concept art, animation tests, pre-release music tracks, and interviews with developers past and present. If all that's filled you with the giddy warmth of memories past, Croc: Legend of the Gobbos launches digitally for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC via GOG on 2nd April, where it'll cost $29.99 USD.",
