Item rewards will be delivered to ship cargo, home station or to the current station the character is currently in. Skill Point and ISK Rewards will be automatically redeemed to the Characters account. EVE Online Patch Notes, March 26, 2025 For quite a while now the skill point farming ability made possible by the AIR Career Program, where players could rack up 750,000 skill points that could be redeemed by any character on account has led to a distortion in play and the economy as player discovered and optimized their play to use this loophole to level up the skills on their mains or farm skill points to be extracted and sold on the market. Your AIR Career Program SP Rewards I detailed how this was done in a past post as I watched Uitra top the system destruction count month after month without CCP apparently knowing or caring.  This pattern led me to declare 2024 the year of the fake kill mail and pretty much made me gave up on reporting in any detail about destruction in New Eden based on the MER because the data from Uitra and a few other systems was polluting the totals, distorting the numbers to such a degree as to make the results every month both predictable and meaningless. As I summed up from CCP’s 2024 numbers, Uitra saw 397,273 hulls and capsules destroyed, 6.75% of ALL destruction in New Eden in 2024.  That was more than the next five systems combined, which included Jita, the perennial top of the list in the before times, and Malukker, another high sec career agent system where people were also farming the AIR Career Program.  Four of the top ten systems by destruction count were places that the AIR Career Program was being farmed. So this was not a small problem, something a few players were doing in an out of the way system where there was some danger involved.  This was ~3K kill mails a day happening in a career system four gates from Jita, with some copy cat systems out there following along. But was it a problem at all? I remain a bit surprised that CCP even bothered to make the change because it inflated the new character creation numbers… the hard core were biomassing a character or two a week per account and rolling up fresh ones to replace them… and made the MER and game activity look better because people were logging in and more ships were being destroyed.  CCP at worst knew and promoted this activity to make the game look better to their corporate masters or, at worst, were loathe to touch it because “fixing” the problem would make their player and destruction metrics go down.  New character creation, destruction, and players in game were all bound to go down with the fix proposed. However, it was likely that the whole thing was distorting the economy a bit, and all the more so as the practice became more widespread.  While there are some ISK rewards as part of the AIR Career Program, it is the injection of skill points into the game that probably turned the tide. Skill points are not ISK, and CCP tends to be obsessed with ISK and ISK faucets and making sure players don’t have too much ISK because they believe with the fullness of their hearts that only ISK drives players to war.  They are wrong, but they have been essentially saying this… and more importantly, behaving in ways that demonstrate this as their primary economic belief that eclipses all others… since the economic outlook post at the end of 2020, in which the demonstrated that none of them were economists or had a single clue as to what motivates players. I can prove this, too.  The evidence was exceedingly obvious. CCP killed off the largest conflict in the history of the game because they thought if we had too much ISK we would not have any more wars.  I mean, it was that fucking stupid.  We were burning trillions and trillions of ISK in battles, setting Guinness Book World records and CCP Rattati came out and literally changed the economy to put a stop to that. Why am I often unhappy with CCP leadership?  That is why.  Four years later they remain adamant that we all need to be poor or we won’t fight, that only starving capsuleers will undock and be willing to lose ships, a theory at its peak led to the lowest login numbers seen since the early days of the game.  It turns out that starving capsuleers… will just go play something else if you make them miserable in your game. So my guess as to why they finally shut down the AIR Career Program loophole at least 18 months after it became an obvious issue visible in the MER, is that it was distorting the economy in some way.  While not an ISK faucet they, are like minerals and PLEX, something of a secondary currency in the economy. So as more and more players got onto the AIR Career Program treadmill, it is likely that more and more of them also stopped keeping the skill points for their main and started extracting them to sell for ISK.  That has the potential to distort the economy, but more importantly to CCP, it also competes with their cash shop packs that will sell you skill points.  A few people pumping up their main with some skill points is one thing, but the potential to flood the market with skill points… well, something must be done! And even that isn’t all that solid of a case, because CCP makes money on selling skill extractors.  But maybe the demand for that was helping to push up the price of PLEX, something that always makes a loud subset of the player base head to r/eve ready to flame. Anyway, I don’t know the reason and I suspect that we will never know the real reason as to why CCP made this change, but it has been made. The change has come too late to have much impact on the March MER, and I suspect that a lot of people won’t notice the change right away, so the April MER will likely show activity tapering off rather that stopping immediately.  I will guess that the May MER will be the first month that shows the post AIR Career Program reality.  We shall see what it looks like.",
