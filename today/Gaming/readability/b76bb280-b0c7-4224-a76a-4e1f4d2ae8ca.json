  "text": "Super Farming Boy is a unique farming game where you will shapechange to become the tools you need to take care of your crop. Super Farming Boy is not only an extremely wacky farming game, but it’s also one that uses combos in a very interesting and new way. In this game, you play as a young hero called Super who was just helping his mom out on her farm when an evil tax man showed up. He stole your money, your powers, and even your mom (who he is now selling). You, being a great son, need to start earning back money and growing crops so that you can save everyone! Crops are cared for in the normal manor; planting them, watering them, giving them time, which you do by changing your hands into the appropriate tools. It’s a different superpower, but it beats having to go back to the shed all the time. However, when it comes to harvesting in Super Farming Boy, you are able to combo harvest your plants, helping leave your stamina untouched while also using that combo to harm enemies or bigger plants. This can really help you, as harming big plants will allow you to pick them even if their level is far above yours. You can spend your day farming and gathering resources in nearby areas, eventually upgrading buildings to gain quests and finding ways to help stop your mom from being sold by the tax man. I played a short demo at Day of the Devs, which was both intriguing and challenging. I think the unique artstyle and the combos feel very good within this world. Watching your character attempt to fly made me laugh out loud (as he does lose his powers early on, and no longer can fly to his full potential). I like the idea that he is the tool and he is able to do all of the work himself without an inventory of breakable tools. Super Farming Boy has a lot of potential and is a game I am going to be keeping my eye on in the coming months. Super Farming Boy is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can grab a demo and add it to your wishlist on Steam.
