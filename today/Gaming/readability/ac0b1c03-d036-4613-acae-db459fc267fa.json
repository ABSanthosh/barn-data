  "text": "Image: Ubisoft / KotakuThe PlayStation 5 Pro has been out for a month now but still has some issues, with certain enhanced games like Dragon Age: The Veilgaurd and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor actually looking uglier in various ways due to resolution upscaling. Ubisoft is now the first game maker to announce an option to turn the feature off, once a new update goes live in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Suggested ReadingThe Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023OffEnglishSuggested Reading“On December 12, we will deploy a hotfix allowing PS5 Pro players to choose between enabling or disabling PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution,” an announcement made on Tuesday reads. “With PSSR disabled, the game will use the same upscaling technology as the PlayStation 5.” The game’s new PS5 Pro 60fps quality mode will still be available, but PSSR can be toggled off to allow players to choose instead between the base 60fps and 30fps modes without the extra visual detail and clarity. This is something players have been requesting for games like Silent Hill 2, Alan Wake II, and more that run sub-optimally with the new PSSR technology. While developers of the games affected are working on addressing issues with new updates, simply allowing players the option to turn the whole thing off would go a long away to ameliorating the frustration in the short-term. That’s because not all games enhanced for PS5 Pro actually give players the option of reverting to the base performance settings for the games. While Insomniac Games includes that option for Spider-Man 2 and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, other PS5 Pro-enhanced games simply replaced the old options with the new PSSR-only ones. The result has been worse performance of games that were actually supposed to look better on the PS5 Pro. While they run at improved framerates, blockbusters like Star Wars Outlaws can suffer from tearing, shimmering, and other weird effects. It’s still unclear if this is a problem with the machine learning tech underpinning PSSR, or simply with how outside developers adapt their games for it. In the meantime, Ubisoft’s hotfix for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora should probably be the default for all PS5 Pro-enhanced games going forward. .",
