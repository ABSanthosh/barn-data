  "text": "News Written By Staff Published 3/5/25 New features! Exclusive movie content! More! Minecraft LIVE is the show to watch to learn about everything happening in the world of Minecraft! Our next one will broadcast at 1PM ET on Saturday March 22! We’ll feature never-before-seen game drop content, go direct to our developers for the top-secret insights, and let you know what’s happening in the wider world of Minecraft. The upcoming show really is packed so be sure to tune in to get the news first-hand.  We’ve also prepared an after show that’s not to be missed! In fact, it’s so special we’ve decided to give it its own name: The Deep Dig starts immediately after the main show and will feature first playthroughs of the new drop, developers sharing their wisdom, and mystery guests!  If you’re one of the greatest people – one of those types who follows every bit of Minecraft news and tracks it all in a detailed calendar - you might be slightly alarmed that this show is happening just six months after the last one. Fret not, dedicated crafter - this is our plan from now on: to share more of our epic plans more regularly. We hope it’s not too overwhelming.   Whether you’re a seasoned crafter or a Minecraft newcomer, this show is a must-watch! Tune in via YouTube, Twitch, or Minecraft.net on Saturday March 22 and get the inside info first-hand! Minecraft LIVE will be broadcast in English, along with English Audio Descriptions, American Sign Language (ASL), and British Sign Language (BSL). Following the broadcast, we will translate the show into Ar. c (MSA), Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, Filipino, French, French (Canadian), German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Persian (Farsi), Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Portuguese, Castilian Spanish, LATAM Spanish (Mexican), Russian, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese subtitles.  Newest News Catch up on the latest Minecraft news \u0026 game updates!",
