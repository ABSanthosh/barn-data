  "description": "So, you're thinking of solving the Atelier Maze in Blue Prince? This particular area has its fair share of mysteries, and reaching it is no easy feat, let alone being able to explore its entirety. Our guide discusses all these details, but be forewarned that there are major spoilers in store.How to solve the Atelier Blueprints Maze in Blue Prince - Atelier and Mount Holly Blueprints Rough Drafts guideThe Atelier is one of the game's secret areas, and reaching it requires the completion of several tasks first:You must reclaim the Throne Room.You must permanently unseal all Blue Doors.A clue that you get from solving the Coat of Arms Puzzle tells you about Still Water.You need to draft the Secret Passage as an outer room, and then you have to collect Still Water so you can interact with the bookshelf.Doing the above grants you access to the Atelier and Mount Holly Blueprints Maze. However, there are a couple of caveats regarding this area:You'll be walking around for quite a while. Ideally, you should have boosts to your number of steps the day prior, such as the +20 buff from the Sauna.If the day ends, you must regain access to this area. Thankfully, don't need to recollect Still Water again. However, you must redraft the Secret Passage as an outer room. This can be a hassle due to the RNG with the Shrine.If you don't think you have enough steps remaining for a single run, then we recommend forcing the game to close--i.e. Alt+F4 on PC. You'll be able to restart the day to better manage your moves--i.e. draft the Coat Check early so you have a lot of steps remaining. Atelier and Mount Holly Blueprints clues: Documents and diagramsThe first set of clues for the Blue Prince Atelier and Mount Holly Blueprints Maze comes from A Hidden Hue, the blank book whose contents were revealed in the previous portion. The book mentions:From prism pristine, three paths convene.Three lines of light. Three shades foreseen.Three colors to count, a sum of eighteen.But the one left hidden remains to be seen.You can also check your surroundings in the main room of the Atelier. You'll notice that there's a rough draft of the manor, the old plans of Auravei. You're also told about the prism, the colors of rooms, such as green, violet, yellow, red, blue, and orange. Atelier and Mount Holly Blueprints clues: Paintings and Mora Jai boxesOnce you enter the Atelier Maze, you'll find out just how discombobulating it is. There are 45 rooms in the Blue Prince Mount Holly Blueprints - Rough Draft zone:Similar to the 44 pairs of paintings in the manor, there are also 44 pairs of paintings in this surreal place. As usual, of the two words that you can think of, one will have an extra letter, which is what you need to jot down.Moreover, each room has a Mora Jai color box that you can solve. Once opened, you'll receive a note that contains a word.Multiple lanterns of various colors surround each room or are placed on the ceiling in hallways.It's up to you if you want to solve all of these things--the joys of exploration and whatnot. Of course, we've also included the solutions in the next section. Atelier and Mount Holly Blueprints: The meaning of the cluesThe 44 pairs of paintings, once solved, form this phrase:THESEVYINGPLANSFORGEBARONCRESTAMONGHEWAMBLESTThe Mora Jai boxes, meanwhile, contain notes that form the following:THROUGH LANTERN LIGHT IN SKETCHESCAST A TINT OF TRUTHTO FIND OUR PATH AHUE OF WISDOM TO TURNUS RIGHT A SHADE OFRAIN TO PASS THE LIGHTTHROUGH LANTERN LIGHT IN SHADOWSPAST WE SEEK WHAT'S LEFTOF THE LIES WE CAST What happens if you just follow lanterns with a specific color?Well, you can certainly try. Even A Hidden Hue mentions that \"three paths convene\" and, if you count all the rooms and lanterns of a specific color following a path, you'd get a sum of 18 as well.However, A Hidden Hue also mentions that there's a fourth path that \"remains to be seen.\" So, if you pick a specific color and follow it all the way to the back, you'll just see a moon door with that color, as well as a note that says: \"THAT WAS NOT THE CORRECT PATH.\" Atelier and Mount Holly Blueprints - Maze lantern colors and directionsTo actually solve the Blue Prince Atelier Blueprints Maze, we need to look at the passage formed by the words from the Mora Jai boxes. These words hint at colors and directions--i.e. where you need to turn/move in the maze:\"Cast a tint of truth\" - This refers to the color blue, since the Blue Memos always tell you the truth. It just so happens that there's one blue lantern in the area.\"Hue of wisdom to turn us right\" - This refers to the color orange, which means you must turn right whenever you come across an orange lantern.\"A shade of rain to pass the light through\" - This refers to the color violet. Passing through means going straight ahead, whether through a corridor or a room, when you see a violet lantern.\"We seek what's left of the lies we cast\" - This refers to the color red, given that red memos tend to be lies or fakes (i.e. the Red Paper Crown). It means you must turn left when you stumble upon a red lantern. Atelier and Mount Holly Blueprints Maze - How to escape the mazeAll right. It's time for us to escape the Mount Holly Blueprints Maze in Blue Prince. The image above shows you the path that you need to take. Here's how it goes:From the Atelier, look for the blue lantern.Enter the Pantry and go out the other way. There's a red lantern above you so turn left.You'll see an orange lantern, so turn right and enter the Gallery.There's another orange lantern, so turn right again after exiting the Gallery.Turn left because of the red lantern and enter the Observatory.There's a purple lantern when you exit, so go straight through the Music Room.Two orange lanterns in succession, so turn right at the corridor, then turn right again to enter the Ballroom.There's a violet lantern, so go straight ahead through the Spare Room.When you exit the Spare Room, you should see a red lantern, so turn left along the corridor.There are a couple of violet lanterns on the ceiling, so keep going forward.You should then see a red lantern. Look at what's on your left. No, it's not the Falcon. It's the blueprint version of Room 46!Note: If you don't follow the above path and you skip some of these sections, the Room 46 blueprint variant might not appear. You'll see a blank wall instead. Atelier and Mount Holly Blueprints Maze - The Room 46 variantThat's it. You've made it all the way to this eerie-looking variant of Room 46. Inside, you'll find the last will and testament of Auravei. Likewise, there's a Mora Jai box that you can open, which reveals a calling card with the word \"BLUE.\"That does it for our guide on how to solve the Atelier and Mount Holly Blueprints Maze in Blue Prince. Then again, there might be more mysteries and secrets in this area, as hinted in A Hidden Hue--i.e. \"a sum of eighteen.\" Perhaps you can trace the path that you just took to the final room, and then look at the words and letters formed by the paintings and Mora Jai boxes.A surreal adventure filled with wonders and mysteries await you in Blue Prince.
