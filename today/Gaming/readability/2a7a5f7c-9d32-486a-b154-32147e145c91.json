  "text": "“Let’s make a 90’s arcade game!” This sounded like a pretty good idea to us at Digital Eclipse back in 2022, when the first seeds of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind took root.  Arcade gaming was firing on all cylinders when MMPR debuted in 1993. The 16-bit home era was well underway and the original PlayStation was still a year from its release in Japan, so coin-operated games still raked in tons of tokens. So if we wanted to give the Power Rangers the high-energy arcade game they always deserved but never got, let’s make the ultimate version of the game that never existed.  The result is Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind, a love letter to the franchise which launches on December 10 on PS5 and PS4. We hinted that the game was more than merely a brawler when we announced the project this past summer, and with about 70% of the gameplay focused on beating up Rita Repulsa’s army of Putty Patrollers, anyone looking to clean house with melee attacks and combos should feel very comfortable. The remaining gameplay takes inspiration from Sega’s innovative super-scaler games, like Space Harrier and Out Run. Before polygons ruled the earth, these games simulated 3D movement with a series of fast-moving 2D sprites. These are designed to deliver fast, in-your-face scrolling action, and we thought they’d be a perfect way to let MMPR fans take down some of the Rangers’ most famous foes.  Case in point: Players can expect to travel through the canyons and rooftops of Angel Grove in the first segment of Rita’s Rewind, learning about the twisty time-travel plot and encountering enemies that simply shouldn’t appear this early in Rangers history. But after brawling and defeating Goldar, Rita Repulsa predictably throws her magic wand down from her lunar palace to give her champion a second chance – and turn him into a skyscraper-sized behemoth. That’s where the super-scaler gameplay comes in. Each Ranger jumps into their appropriate Dinozord and charges into the Z-axis in hot pursuit, blasting all obstacles and enemies with powered-up weapons like missiles and dual lasers. This gameplay really draws on that Sega legacy, throwing back to games like Galaxy Force and After Burner – constant movement, waves of insistent enemies, and powerful attacks to take them out of your way.  Once Goldar is caught, the gameplay shifts again, this time to a first-person fighting game, where the Power Rangers form the mighty Megazord to slug it out directly with the boss. It’s his face versus your fists, once again utilizing that 2.5D visual approach found in vintage arcade games. Each player gets a chance to wear the boss down, contributing whatever they can to the cause and ultimately defeating the bosses with the Power Rangers’ ultimate weapon: teamwork.  Mixing all these different genres felt like the right thing to do to keep Rita’s Rewind perpetually fresh, but it was a heck of a lot of fun for us, too. We love brawlers, but they can get repetitive; we’re hoping that mixing in racing, blasting, and punching will make Rita’s Rewind a thrill for players who have always dreamed about what Jason, Trini, Zack, Billy, and Kimberly’s game would have been like had they walked into an arcade in the mid-1990s. In fact, one of the concepts that drives a lot of what we do at Digital Eclipse is the desire to make games the way you remember them playing, even if your memories have made those experiences a little sweeter and cooler than they might have actually been back in the day. Our goal with Rita’s Rewind is to make a game that could have existed, and certainly should have existed, but probably wouldn’t have existed with all this variety in one place. Since we have the benefit of looking at arcade gaming in the rearview mirror for 30 years, we’ll take advantage of that to try to deliver something better than you would have remembered.   Rita’s Rewind will debut on PS5 and PS4 on December 10, and you can pre-order it now. When that day comes, we hope you enjoy heading back to the 1990s with us, both in terms of Power Rangers history and arcade gameplay – even if it’s your first visit.  Trending Stories",
