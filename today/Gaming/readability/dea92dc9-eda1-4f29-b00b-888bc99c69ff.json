  "text": "The Site Here we are at my 389th and final blog post of the year… barring any major, late in the day New Year’s Eve announcements.  But that seems unlikely. The only empty square is today’s On that chart the light blue are days with a single post, dark blue means a double post day.  I had no triple post days in 2024.  366 days plus 23 double post days gets us to 389.  The stats tell me those posts totaled up to 579,026 words.  A lot of words about not very much. Overall, a pretty good year for the site.  When it comes to page views or daily uniques or even ad revenue, 2024 was a good year.  Traffic was nearly up to 2018 levels, which was the first recovery bounce at the site after the general decline that set in.  It is all still less than half of my 2012 traffic, but things were very different a dozen years ago. TAGN Page View Traffic by Full Years Of course, it would hardly be a month in review if I did not complain about WordPress.com.  This month they… well, they didn’t break their stats page in the web UI completely, but they made it much more annoying and they did break some aspects of it.  It was clearly another “what if we did X with stats?” moment which they then implemented without thinking it through. Anyway, before the change one would go to the stats page which defaulted to a display by days, with the current day selected and all stats on the page reflecting that specific day.  Now if you go to stats the default is still days, but it has seven days displayed and the stats reflect the total of all seven days. Now, all I want to see 90% of the time is today’s stats.  What is going on today?  Now I have to click on the current day in the graph at the top and all the stats then change to that day.  Fine.  And the graph changes to traffic by hour, which I am sure some big site wants to know about but which is trivia to me. (Also, you are in a navigational dead end. Any UI that requires the user to go with the browser back button is bad.) And it has been likewise changed for week, month, and year view, making all their default stats metrics that I don’t really care about.  Not the biggest annoyance in the world, and frankly it is probably hurting them because every additional stats click is another database query that needs to be run on the server.  Only a very dumb company would think “let’s double our back end queries!” was a good idea. However, they also broke the ability to drill down on stats for a single day, week, month, or year.  They only work for the now expanded ranges of 7 days, weeks, months, or years because they only tested the happy path of “does this still work” and didn’t think about the changed states because they are bad at this and don’t care about customers… something the 2024 WordPress.com drama has cemented in my opinions. But the blog goes on.  The side effect is that the list for most viewed posts for the month is based on the last 30 days, a default that still works, and not views in December.  For a 31 day month that is close enough… though I could go into how annoying they made that UI, but that has been in place for a year at this point. Does Auotmattic, the parent company, screw up Tumblr this much?  I don’t pay close enough attention to know. TL;DR – The enshittification will continue until morale improves. One Year Ago There was, of course, a Steam Winter Sale. World of Warcraft Classic – Season of Discovery arrived with the promise of rogue and mage tanks.  We jumped in and started looking for runes, which was easier for some classes than others.  It seemed like a work in progress at times.  We were, as usual, trying to sort out who was in which role as we made our way to Westfall and did a Wetlands run. I ranked the Wrath of the Lich King zones. Also, Blizz gave us 2024 roadmaps for retail and classic and Bobby Kotick was out at last. EverQuest launched expansion number 30, Laurion’s Song. It was time for the Winter Nexus in EVE Online. I went in and mined my way through some of it… twice actually, though I am not sure how fun it really was.  We also had the AIR Daily Opportunities rework for some rewards. There were also some good times and bad, as happens in New Eden. The MER showed that the Havoc expansion brought a lot of people into New Eden. Meanwhile, EVE Vanguard, the CCP shooter of the moment, was off to its first public test, for EVE Online subscribers only. Then there were the annual recaps for 2023 including: My Twitch time for 2023 My Books of 2023 My Steam Replay and XBox Stats My Year in EVE Online Looking Back at 2023 – Highs and Lows I recognized TorilMUD for being around in one form or another for thirty years. I reviewed my predictions for 2023. I was pondering my next computer… which became my current computer about two months later. And on the Telephone Tales front I had posts two and three about Usenet and then about leaving Global Village and working at Big Island. Five Years Ago After many slipped dates and fan push back, Daybreak decided to shut down PlanetSide Arena, their attempt to re-capture some of that battle royale lightning that H1Z1 held briefly when it launched. On the bright side, EverQuest launched its 26th expansion, the Torment of Velious. I also made a pilgrimage of my own in old Norrath. CCP experimented with a day of no downtime.  I heard later that this caused problems and the next downtime had to run long.  You just have to reboot New Eden once a day I guess. CCP also brought in the HyperNet Relay gambling mechanic, the new wallet UI, and the Kicking over Castles update to make blowing up structures a bit easier.  We got the Naughty or Nice holiday event which included a station to refurbish melted snowballs. The holiday season also came to WoW Classic and EverQuest II. Blizzard introduced battlegrounds to WoW Classic early to stem the completely predictable carnage that came about from the introduction of the honor system.  We also got the key chain and paid character transfers. In WoW Classic we hit our peak group size as six of us ran off to the Scarlet Monastery graveyard.  Back in vanilla a bunch of dungeons allowed raid groups of 10 players.  Skonk and I also got our paladins out for the Test of Righteousness class quest. We were also back in Gnomeregan for some quest clean up with Earl.  I had to swap to my pally so he could tank.  And then we went back with a different group mix.  Then we went back in again to get Moronae the Crowd Pummeler 9-60.    Finally, we went back to Scarlet Monastery to run through the library. Then I reviewed my WoW Classic characters four months into the launch. On the retail WoW front I broke the story of the rejected squish ideas. I was still running around tuning up my main in EverQuest II until the Blood of Luclin expansion launched.  Getting to Luclin was a bit of a chore, at least the first time through.  From there the run to level cap was pretty quick. And, it being December, there were the usual reflection on the year gone by.  I looked at my games played, reviewed my 2019 predictions, looked at the books I read, and reviewed highs and lows of the year. I also did a Decade in Review post about gaming related stuff. And then 2020 hit.  But that is another tale altogether. Ten Years Ago After my hardware woes the month before, I had to figure out which games to install again. My MMO Outlook for 2015 was bleak.  But not as bleak as the reality ended up.  And then there were the highs and lows of 2014. Syp was on about “real” MMO studios, strongly suggesting that you had to have more than one MMO to be legit.  I questioned whether that was really the case or not.  Examples were discussed. It was the 10 year anniversary of the Nintendo DS handheld system. Warlords of Draenor having launched at the end of November, the instance group was getting together in Azeroth and building garrisons… so we could be apart.  Of course, my first character into Draenor was already level 100 shortly thereafter.  We engaged in some jumping puzzles and then had to ride across country to the Bloodmaul Slag Mines. Coming back to WoW also got me to post five seemingly simple things I wanted to see fixed.  I think they’re all still unchanged at this point. I also spent a bit of time in EverQuest II over the holidays, figuring out where to go, getting some AA points handed to me, and rolling out into the Kylong Plains.  I also tried to recall the events around the great downtime of December 2004. In New Eden, NCDot’s invasion of Fountain was pushed back.  Reavers were operating in their backfield in Querious, where Asher managed to setup a trap that lead to us killing four supers.  Then it was back to our home in the north. We also got the Rhea expansion from CCP, which gave us graphical updates, the Bowhead freighter, the removal of clone costs, and Thera, a new kind of wormhole system.  There was also a blog banter about what to tell new players about EVE Online. I was also wondering if PLEX-like currency items were working out well in any games besides EVE Online.  That was before the WoW Token came on the scene. And I posted about three science fiction series I had started reading. Fifteen Years Ago Let’s see… a random reader wrote in to tell me that the social aspects of MMOs were insignificant.  It wasn’t even Gevlon.  Still, I don’t think he understood what he was talking about. People seemed to be getting worked up as to how you define content in an MMO.  Can you compare sandbox and amusement park content fairly?  Taking some of this to its logical extreme, I demonstrated something that trumped all MMO content. Also getting people worked up was the catch in the whole free to play model, brought up by changes to the store in Battlefield Heroes.  That actually got responses all over the place. The US release date for Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver was announced. People were warming up for Star Trek Online.  There was a confusing array of pre-order options.  But it was missing some items I really wanted. In World of Warcraft we were busy wrapping up the holiday achievements, including Pilgrim’s Bounty. We were also playing with this new Dungeon Finder thing that showed up with WoW patch 3.3.  Automated cross-server instance group matching with random strangers?  It will never work. The instance group, in its horde RP-PvP server form, was hitting Gnomeregan and Shadowfang Keep, both of which seemed… much easier. And I was officially epic… proven by the achievement.  Of course by that time, somebody already had all the possible WoW achievements.  Too epic to be believed. Meanwhile, this horrible image was keeping me up at nights.  You just cannot unsee some things once you have seen them. In EVE Online the Dominion expansion went live, changing how players captured and held sovereignty in null sec.  Out was POS based sovereignty and in were territorial claim units (TCUs), infrastructure hubs (ihubs), sovereignty blockade units (SBUs), and all the fun times they brought.  I wasn’t in null sec at the time, but would learn all about these things later on. Finally, there was an actual podcast interview with Erik “WoW isn’t easy enough” Estavillo.  He was a surprisingly good sport about being the subject of mockery. Twenty Years Ago In EverQuest II there was the great December downtime, where the game was offline for more than a day when the servers wouldn’t come up after an update.  I wrote up a bit about that a decade later, but you can find some contemporary commentary over at Terra Nova. Anarchy Online introduced a Free to Play program, five years before Dungeons \u0026 Dragons Online made a splash with that idea, replacing trial subscriptions for new players.  It gave players access to the original content for free.  Free players were shown ads on in-game billboards to help fund this new program.  Started as a one year experiment, free is still an option within the game. The very first version of Garry’s Mod, one of the oddest early “games” to take advantage of Steam and Valve’s Source Engine, was launched.  A best selling package on Steam, it is a sandbox that lets people tinker with assets from Valve’s games such as Half-Life 2.  It was used as the basis for a number of web comics, such as the famed Concerned, as well as videos and other creations. Thirty Years Ago Sony launched the original PlayStation console.  Sony’s aggressive courting of third party developers, something the then market giants Nintendo and Sega did in a half-hearted fashion at best, led to a software library that allowed Sony to dominate.  This eventually drove Sega and the second tier competitors out of the console market and led Nintendo to double down on its insular franchise pattern that often goes for years pretending no other consoles even exist.

Enshrouded Still our group favorite, two months in.  Some decent adventures were to be had in what is shaping up to be a well put together game.  I am kind of glad we didn’t jump in until the big update at the start of November, because we have been covering a lot of ground there. EVE Online Winter Nexus, Twitch drops, some fights, some work on alts, some work on the AIR Career Program work to maybe earn some of that sweet, sweet SP available from it.  Things were done. I am a bit disappointed that CCP didn’t do any sort of year end summary for players this year.  It is some work, I get it… and it has been, at times, hilariously wrong.  This year, they didn’t even give it a try.  I suspect that is another victim of pulling staff on to other projects like EVE Frontier. EverQuest The Year of Darkpaw and the 25th anniversary is coming to a close.  I made it through one more Overseer achievement before giving that a pass for the rest of the month.  My All Access subscription, active for a full year, runs out next week.  Given I subscribed for a full year, I didn’t actually PLAY the game (or EQ2, which hit 20) at all really. No Man’s Sky I felt a bit of an urge to peek into this during the month.  I spent a couple of hours poking around.  However, like any progression based game, dropping out for a few month then showing back meant feeling pretty lost.  I could probably get back on the horse is I really felt it… but I wasn’t feeling it this time so let it go after not too long. Pokemon Go Level: 46 (level, 122% of the way to 47, 3 of 4 tasks complete) Pokedex status: 857 (+4) caught, 869 (+5) seen Pokemon I want: Some missing ones from the older Pokedexes Current buddy: Gyarados because I need candies As I mentioned in a post a few of days back, I am still working on getting three Pokemon to max CP.  I expect that will happen within a week as I am pretty much down to just needing more stardust to get me there.  Once I get there, there will likely be a post about that and the new tasks needed to get to level 48, with which I will have my own issues. Stars Reach We all got a peek at the homestead and building options that are in progress, and the test servers were up for some longer stretches for those who wanted to really dig into those. WoW and WoW Classic Didn’t really play either.  I logged into retail to get the annual Winterfell gift achievement, but otherwise it was a pretty Azeroth free month. Coming Up A new year full of… something. There will be something along the lines of my usual first post of the year tomorrow.  Things to think about and evaluate over the course of the year.  That will be followed by some final summing up of 2024.  I swear that will be done by February at the latest! The Steam Winter Sale will be over.  We’ll see if I purchase anything.  I have not pressed the button yet, but I have two items in my cart.  Will I commit of let them go?  Find out on Thursday I guess. The Fantasy Critic League experiment is set to commence on Saturday. (Read about that here.)  We’ll see how that goes.  Did I mention it is a full year league?  I must have.  Anyway, I will have to work out how often to do update posts about it.  It is one of those things that will probably warrant some coverage right out of the gate… I love the initial forecast based on the draft, and there will be some scramble for bids… but after a while I suspect it will settle down to a monthly update.  We’ll see. Oh, and there is even a podcast about Fantasy Critic League with the latest episode focused on strategies for 2025.  It is only two episodes old, but the first episode is all about the mechanics of the game, which may be of some use in addition to my brief description. I also finished up the Telephone Tales series of posts so I can move on to writing about something else.  I could possibly explore the idea of not writing about something else, but when has that ever worked out for me? Meanwhile, the rest of the usual stuff will likely remain the usual stuff.  I’ll play EVE Online.  The group will play Enshrouded.  Who knows, maybe we’ll go back to Cataclysm Classic.",

display by days, with the current day selected and all stats on the page reflecting that specific day.  Now if you go to stats the default is still days, but it has seven days displayed and the stats reflect the total of all seven days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, all I want to see 90% of the time is today’s stats.  What is going on today?  Now I have to click on the current day in the graph at the top and all the stats then change to that day.  Fine.  And the graph changes to traffic by hour, which I am sure some big site wants to know about but which is trivia to me. (Also, you are in a navigational dead end. Any UI that requires the user to go with the browser back button is bad.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it has been likewise changed for week, month, and year view, making all their default stats metrics that I don’t really care about.  Not the biggest annoyance in the world, and frankly it is probably hurting them because every additional stats click is another database query that needs to be run on the server.  Only a very dumb company would think “let’s double our back end queries!” was a good idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, they also broke the ability to drill down on stats for a single day, week, month, or year.  They only work for the now expanded ranges of 7 days, weeks, months, or years because they only tested the happy path of “does this still work” and didn’t think about the changed states because they are bad at this and don’t care about customers… something the 2024 WordPress.com drama has cemented in my opinions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the blog goes on.  The side effect is that the list for most viewed posts for the month is based on the last 30 days, a default that still works, and not views in December.  For a 31 day month that is close enough… though I could go into how annoying they made that UI, but that has been in place for a year at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes Auotmattic, the parent company, screw up Tumblr this much?  I don’t pay close enough attention to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTL;DR – \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification\"\u003eThe enshittification\u003c/a\u003e will continue until morale improves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne Year Ago\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was, of course, \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/12/21/the-steam-winter-sale-2023-has-begun/\"\u003ea Steam Winter Sale\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/12/01/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-arrives/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWorld of Warcraft Classic – Season of Discovery\u003c/em\u003e arrived\u003c/a\u003e with the promise of rogue and mage tanks.  \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/12/04/opening-moves-in-wow-classic-season-of-discovery/\"\u003eWe jumped in and started looking for runes\u003c/a\u003e, which was easier for some classes than others.  It \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/12/07/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-bugs-and-nerfs-and-what-is-even-going-on-here/\"\u003eseemed like a work in progress\u003c/a\u003e at times.  We were, as usual, trying to sort out \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/12/14/sorting-ourselves-out-in-the-wow-classic-season-of-discovery/\"\u003ewho was in which role\u003c/a\u003e as we \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/12/19/arriving-in-westfall-in-wow-classic-season-of-discovery/\"\u003emade our way to Westfall\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/12/28/the-wetlands-run-in-season-of-discovery/\"\u003edid a Wetlands run\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/12/27/wrath-of-the-lich-king-zones-ranked/\"\u003eranked the \u003cem\u003eWrath of the Lich King\u003c/em\u003e zones\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, Blizz gave us \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/12/20/blizzard-2024-roadmaps-for-wow-retail-and-wow-classic/\"\u003e2024 roadmaps for retail and classic\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/12/29/ding-dong-the-witch-is-dead-kotick-departs-activision-blizzard/\"\u003eBobby Kotick was out at last\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEverQuest\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/12/06/the-laurions-song-expansion-arrives-for-everquest-today-bringing-class-swapping-and-more/\"\u003elaunched expansion number 30\u003c/a\u003e, \u003cem\u003eLaurion’s Song\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time for \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/12/05/the-winter-nexus-2023-arrives-in-eve-online/\"\u003ethe Winter Nexus in \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

Frontier\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEverQuest\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Year of Darkpaw and the 25th anniversary is coming to a close.  I made it through one more Overseer achievement before giving that a pass for the rest of the month.  My All Access subscription, active for a full year, runs out next week.  Given I subscribed for a full year, I didn’t actually PLAY the game (or \u003cem\u003eEQ2\u003c/em\u003e, which hit 20) at all really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo Man’s Sky\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a bit of an urge to peek into this during the month.  I spent a couple of hours poking around.  However, like any progression based game, dropping out for a few month then showing back meant feeling pretty lost.  I could probably get back on the horse is I really felt it… but I wasn’t feeling it this time so let it go after not too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePokemon Go\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLevel: 46 (level, 122% of the way to 47, 3 of 4 tasks

to max CP.  I expect that will happen within a week as I am pretty much down to just needing more stardust to get me there.  Once I get there, there will likely be a post about that and the new tasks needed to get to level 48, with which I will have my own issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStars Reach\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all got a peek at the

something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere will be something along the lines of my usual first post of the year tomorrow.  Things to think about and evaluate over the course of the year.  That will be followed by some final summing up of 2024.  I swear that will be done by February at the latest!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Steam Winter Sale will be over.  We’ll see if I purchase anything.  I have not pressed the button yet, but I have two items in my cart.  Will I commit of let them go?  Find out on Thursday I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fantasy Critic League experiment is set to commence on Saturday. (\u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2024/12/27/tagn-fantasy-critic-league-2025/\"\u003eRead about that here\u003c/a\u003e.)  We’ll see how that goes.  Did I mention it is a full year league?  I must have.  Anyway, I will have to work out how often to do update posts about it.  It is one of those things that will probably warrant some coverage right out of the gate… I love the initial forecast based on the draft, and there will be some scramble for bids… but after a while I suspect it will settle down to a monthly update.  We’ll see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, and there is even a podcast about Fantasy Critic League with \u003ca href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/episode-02-the-draft/id1784246680?i=1000682097701\"\u003ethe latest episode focused on strategies for 2025\u003c/a\u003e.  It is only two episodes old, but the first episode is all about the mechanics of the game, which may be of some use in addition to my brief description.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also finished up the Telephone Tales series of posts so I can move on to writing about something else.  I could possibly explore the idea of not writing about something else, but when has that ever worked out for me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the rest of the usual stuff will likely remain the usual stuff.  I’ll play \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e.  The group will play \u003cem\u003eEnshrouded\u003c/em\u003e.  Who knows, maybe we’ll go back to \u003cem\u003eCataclysm Classic\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
