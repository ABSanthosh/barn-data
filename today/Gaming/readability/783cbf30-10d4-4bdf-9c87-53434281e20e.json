  "text": "This weekend Bungie revealed Marathon’s sci-fi-fueled gameplay to the world. The studio, celebrated for its sublime first-person gunplay and ever-expanding gameplay, is venturing into the extraction-shooter genre when the game launches on September 23. The Marathon premise is simple and enticing: load up your Runner with valuable gear, compete with other players to secure more loot, and risk it all trying to extract with all the goods.  I had the opportunity to catch up with Marathon Game Director Joe Ziegler hot off the heels of this reveal, diving deeper into the details around Bungie’s next game. We cover lots of ground, including Bungie’s approach to a new genre, tapping into the power of PS5, the game’s bold art style, and more. Tim Turi: Congratulations on the big gameplay reveal! How are you and the team feeling following the event? Joe Ziegler: It’s pretty exciting. The term I’ve been using a lot is “nerve-cited.” It’s a labor of love we’ve been working on for a few years now, and that definitely comes with the passion that we’ve poured into it, iterating with our audiences, and this desire to produce something amazing to play and to see.  Having it touch real players’ hands for the first time is thrilling, because we do this to excite and entertain them in amazing ways, but also nerve wracking. You know, you question a lot of decisions you made. You’re really hoping that all the things that you’ve thought of are really what players care about. And we feel like we’re there, but we’re really excited to see what players have to say. During the development of Marathon, were there specific moments or experiences that made the Bungie team realize it was onto something special? So many of them are these unpredictable moments. Moments where you thought one thing was going to happen, but another thing happened. In our game, you’re traveling to this mysterious world where danger could lurk around every corner. Sometimes you turn a corner and you’re face to face with the United Earth Space Council (UESC), these really brutal and dangerous opponents inside of our game. Or sometimes you’re just traversing across the map and bullets are whizzing by from another crew that has seen you. And some of those moments get extremely exciting, because you don’t think you’re going to make it out of it, and you turn the tables, or you just barely eke by, and you find your way out to the exfil. When you get out, you’re just shaking with an awesome intensity that you’re going to remember for a long time. What’s the backstory behind the name “Marathon?” In the original (1994) game, “Marathon” is the name of the colony ship sent out from Earth by the UESC. They sent it past the reaches of our solar system to establish the first colony on a system called Tau Ceti. And so the UESC Marathon is kind of a weird ship built into an asteroid-like moon, and then sent out to make the long journey. …if you were to make me guess, I’d assume that “Marathon” refers to the fact that it was a 500-year journey, and was an appropriate name for a very, very long commitment of travel.  We’re using the Marathon name [for this new 2025 game] because of the legacy of the IP. We’re taking a lot of those familiar IP elements, the UESC Marathon ship as well, and bringing it to light in modern day. We’re reinterpreting a lot of things, but there are a lot of familiar elements as well, such as the ship and Tau Ceti, that I think fans from the past will really enjoy seeing. Bungie is famous for its pitch-perfect gunplay. How do you go about being true to that legacy while making Marathon’s FPS action feel like its own thing? A lot of it comes from the nature of the game and the types of decisions that you want players to be making and how you want them to make those decisions. This game is very much about survival. And in survival-style games, a lot of the pressure is on you to manage resources, be adaptive, and be situationally aware. What we’re doing with our gunplay and our systems is we’re taking a lot of that familiar action base that players really enjoy, and we’re adding intense survival layers on top. For example, you don’t regenerate health automatically very quickly, but you have consumables that help you heal. Part of that is to create moments where you make decisions to either go into battle or fall back. You have to think about the resources that you’re carrying.  Do you have a message for any players curious about extraction shooters, but are a little nervous or intimidated by the risk/reward? I will definitely say that this game is challenging and intense, but it’s very rewarding. As you learn it you’ll feel yourself developing survival skills that you may not have experienced before, that begin to make you feel masterful. We have also designed this game to feel really natural on controllers as well. There are a lot of PC extraction shooters where mouse and keyboard are a little bit more common, and so in designing for that what we’re trying to do is get the interface and gameplay finickiness out so you can play it naturally. We want you to be able to focus on adapting and learning those survival skills to pull off memorable runs. Obviously players are risking their valuable loadouts in a given match. Can you tell us about any persistent progression elements? We want to make sure the players feel like they get something for their time spent in every match. Some of that is going to be experience-based. For example, leveling your runner level in any given season. Some of that will be related to upgrades provided by factions. As you gather materials or get currencies, you’ll be able to increase some of your overall character stats. So you might get a little bit more stamina, or you might be able to loot boxes a little bit faster. Some of it will also increase the options that you have to purchase from an in-game item store called the Black Market. You can use the currency you collect in game to purchase different weapons, implants, and upgrades based on what you unlock inside of that upgrade tree. So as you play the game you’ll see a lot of your options grow. What ways is Bungie taking advantage of PlayStation 5 technology for Marathon? We definitely have haptic support for [DualSense wireless controllers], which is pretty fun when you get into some of those gunfights and you feel feedback on your fingertips. We’re also supporting the Tempest 3D Audio engine, so you’re going to hear a lot of immersive audio.  In addition, a lot of the rendering technology on the PS5, and especially on the PS5 Pro, is really awesome. So we’re planning some awesome usage of PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution), and some additional support in upscaling and resolution. So if you have a PS5 or PS5 Pro you’ll be pleasantly surprised by how we deliver on the console.  Marathon’s art style is not quite like anything else out there right now. Can you walk us through what makes it so striking and unique? Our aesthetic is hugely inspired by graphic design and a lot of modern product design trappings. But I think what really sets us apart is whenever I look at a [Marathon] image, I go, “I think I understand it,” or “I think I don’t… but I really like it.” There’s something really enticing about visuals that look so bold and graphic like something you’d see in print but also pulled onto the screen and mixed with this technological sci-fi shaping. That, and also put against a very organic background and the contrast of all these things really pops. It’s a mixture that I don’t think we’ve seen a lot of before, and we’re really excited by it, because it creates all those visual contrasts and conflicts that go together to help the tone of the game, which is really about paranoia. It’s about intensity. It’s about not knowing the truth you know, seeking to find it, and constantly being wrapped into a rabbit hole of information. You don’t know what’s true or false. So all those things kind of come together really nicely through the art style as well.  Is there anything else you’d like to make sure the PlayStation audience takes away from this big reveal? If you’re a person who really enjoys getting into survival experiences. If you’re a person who really enjoys testing your mettle with other players inside of that space trying to do the same. And if you’re a player who really, just wants to go on a thrilling ride that you never know the outcome of… I think this is going to be a game for you. Especially because we’ve focused so much on making this an experience that translates across platforms really well. I’m especially excited to see PlayStation players come in and experience the genre and our offering inside of it. We’ve poured a lot of passion and love into [Marathon], and we’ve played it a lot, and we played a lot for fun too. So we’re excited to have them join our community, show us what’s good, and show us how good they can be. Marathon launches September 23 on PS5, Steam, and Xbox Series X|S.",

So if you have a PS5 or PS5 Pro you’ll be pleasantly surprised by how we deliver on the console. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\t\u003cdiv data-youtube-id=\"-itAC7Z6jZw\" data-title=\"\"\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\u003cimg src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/-itAC7Z6jZw/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/-itAC7Z6jZw/default.jpg 120w, https://img.youtube.com/vi/-itAC7Z6jZw/mqdefault.jpg 320w, https://img.youtube.com/vi/-itAC7Z6jZw/hqdefault.jpg 480w, https://img.youtube.com/vi/-itAC7Z6jZw/sddefault.jpg 640w, https://img.youtube.com/vi/-itAC7Z6jZw/maxresdefault.jpg 1280w\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 1170px) 936px, (min-width: 960px) 80vw, 100vw\" data-src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/-itAC7Z6jZw/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Marathon developer interview: Bungie shares more on its extraction FPS action\" srcset=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/-itAC7Z6jZw/default.jpg 120w, https://img.youtube.com/vi/-itAC7Z6jZw/mqdefault.jpg 320w, https://img.youtube.com/vi/-itAC7Z6jZw/hqdefault.jpg 480w, https://img.youtube.com/vi/-itAC7Z6jZw/sddefault.jpg 640w, https://img.youtube.com/vi/-itAC7Z6jZw/maxresdefault.jpg 1280w\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarathon’s art style is not quite like anything else out there right now. Can you walk us through what makes it so striking and unique?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur aesthetic is hugely inspired by graphic design and a lot of modern product design trappings. But I think what really sets us apart is whenever I look at a [Marathon] image, I go, “I think I understand it,” or “I think I don’t… but I really like it.” There’s something really enticing about visuals that look so bold and graphic like something you’d see in print but also pulled onto the screen and mixed with this technological sci-fi shaping. That, and also put against a very organic background and the contrast of all these things really pops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a mixture that I don’t think we’ve seen a lot of before, and we’re really excited by it, because it creates all those visual contrasts and conflicts that go together to help the tone of the game, which is really about paranoia. It’s about intensity. It’s about not knowing the truth you know, seeking to find it, and constantly being wrapped into a rabbit hole of information. You don’t know what’s true or false. So all those things kind of come together really nicely through the art style as well. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs there anything else you’d like to make sure the PlayStation audience takes away from this big reveal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re a person who really enjoys getting into survival experiences. If you’re a person who really enjoys testing your mettle with other players inside of that space trying to do the same. And if you’re a player who really, just wants to go on a thrilling ride that you never know the outcome of… I think this is going to be a game for you. Especially because we’ve focused so much on making this an experience that translates across platforms really well. I’m especially excited to see PlayStation players come in and experience the genre and our offering inside of it. We’ve poured a lot of passion and love into [Marathon], and we’ve played it a lot, and we played a lot for fun too. So we’re excited to have them join our community, show us what’s good, and show us how good they can be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMarathon launches September 23 on PS5, Steam, and Xbox Series X|S.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
