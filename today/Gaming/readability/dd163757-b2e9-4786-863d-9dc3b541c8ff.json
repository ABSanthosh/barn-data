Activision also won't be offering refunds to players who purchased CoD Points or Black Cell in Warzone Mobile.\"This decision was made after careful consideration of various factors and while we're proud of the accomplishment in bringing Call of Duty: Warzone to mobile in an authentic way, it unfortunately has not met our expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences,\" the statement says.While that effectively means that support for Warzone Mobile seems to be coming to an end, GameSpot understands that Activision's Warzone Mobile teams are moving forward on other projects.
