  "text": "Pre-orders finally open next week. Image credit: Adobe / Nintendo / Eurogamer Nintendo has finally detailed how US tariffs will impact the launch of Switch 2, and confirmed price rises for an array of console accessories \"due to changes in market conditions\". A new set of Joy-Con 2 controllers, for example, will now cost $95, an increase of $5. The Switch 2 Pro controller and Switch 2 camera have also seen $5 price rises, up to $85 and $55 respectively. But the $450 Switch 2 itself, including its $500 bundle with Mario Kart World, will not increase in price for now, Nintendo has decided. The cost of key software launches Mario Kart World ($80 when bought separately) and Donkey Kong Bananza ($70) will also remain unchanged \"at launch\", Nintendo has said. Eurogamer goes hands-on with Switch 2.Watch on YouTube The news comes amidst a backdrop of calls from fans for Nintendo to lower the price of Switch 2 - something that seemed increasingly unlikely as the expected impact of tariffs became clear. Indeed, a statement from Nintendo today makes clear that price rises may still take place in future - and not just for Switch 2. \"Other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions,\" the company said. Switch 2 pre-orders in the US, which had been delayed while Nintendo took stock of the fluctuating economic situation, will now finally begin next Thursday, 24th April. \"We apologise for the retail pre-order delay, and hope this reduces some of the uncertainty our customers may be facing,\" Nintendo added. \"We thank our customers for their patience, and we share their excitement to experience Nintendo Switch 2 starting 5th June 2025.\" Eurogamer previously heard from an analyst that predicted Nintendo would likely not raise the price of Switch 2 in response to tariffs, as it faced criticism of the console's cost already. While a portion of Switch 2 consoles are being manufactured in China, Nintendo has also used factories in Vietnam and diverted the majority of their manufactured stock to the US in advance of the current US-Chinese trade war taking effect.",
