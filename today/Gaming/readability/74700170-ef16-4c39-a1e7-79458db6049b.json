Then there was the rather good Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales, which wove Gwent into a single-player story. Brendy quite liked it. You can read the full press release here, if you’d like. This one is supposed to be out Q3 of next year. In other Witchly news, The Witcher 4 has entered \"the most intensive phase of development\".",
