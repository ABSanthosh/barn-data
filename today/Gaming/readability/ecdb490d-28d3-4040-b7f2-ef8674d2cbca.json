I actually got in the first fleet, which filled up almost immediately… I was logged in and ready… and we were quickly bridged off to EFM-C4, the system that connects to Etherium Reach and PanFam’s staging, where we had one of their Fortizars coming out for its hull timer. We warped over to it and started shooting. So anyway, I started blasting We had a full fleet of Raven Navy Issues floating above the Fortizar, out of PDS range, and were hitting hard enough that we dialed everybody back to a single launcher to not waste ammo on deflected over damage cap shots.  Only the top damage try hards kept all launchers running. The Raven fleet in protective bubbles, the Keepstar in the background That got us our first kill of the evening as the Fortizar popped. We then warped over to our siege Fortizar and got in range of the titan that was there to bridge us over to HB-1NJ, where the NCDot Keepstar shoot had started.  We waited for a while, then were told to align to the PH Keepstar in EFM-C4, which had just come out and had its 30 minute timer running down. While there were seven or more fleets over in HB-1NJ, it became our job to stop the clock on the EFM-C4 Keepstar.  So we spread out and started shooting it, holding the timer for everybody else.  It looked like we might not get on the other Keepstar kill mail.  But still, getting on one and a Fortizar… not a bad evening’s work. We sat there, one launcher cycling… and then half of us with no launchers running… because we wanted to do just enough damage to stop the timer while preserving the structure for the bulk of the fleet that was off shooting the other Keepstar.  You do your job for the coalition. PanFam was reported to think that we would be heading through the gate and into their staging in G-QTSD, as we did the other night, given the huge force we had mustered, so they did not organize any defense, save for a Tornado fleet that zipped around trying to catch stragglers. Tornados lurking They picked off a couple of us, we picked off a few of them, it kept everybody awake while we slowly plinked away at the structure. (The Tornados later picked off a Babaroga, the new Triglavia marauder, a very expensive loss, so they had a good night.) We played at that for a while as the other Keepstar was getting chewed up… but at least we were not facing and tidi in our system. Then Sonreir, our FC, had us stop shooting and align back to our Fortizar again.  We warped over, got on the titan once more, and this time we were bridged over to HB-1NJ, where we got on grid with the Keepstart there at 6% hull.  We were able to get in our hits and then watch it explode. The HB-1NJ Keepstar explodes Then it was time to turn everybody around and get back to EFM-C4 to finish off that Keepstar.  We hung about in system for a bit then got our ride back to where we started, only to find 2000 people in local with tidi in tow. The EFM-C4 Keepstar again From there is was just a lot of shooting as we slowly burned down our second Keepstar of the evening.  There were a lot of people in system by then and tidi was down below 20%, which mean things were still working, just slow.  But slow and steady things went until the Keepstar exploded. The moment of the explosion Somehow the Keepstar zapped a Rorqual of ours there on the undock… you can see it exploding in the image above… just before it went up.  I guess whoever was gunning it saved up for that last shot.  The hazards of being in GSOL.  That and the Babaroga don’t offset the loss of a couple of 300 billion ISK Keepstars and a Fortizar, but you take the small wins when you can get them. (The PanFam claim that they won the ISK war… if you take structures off the battle report… is being pilloried over on r/eve, as it should be.) The structure kills for the op: EFM-C4 Fortizar EFM-C4 Keepstar HB-1NJ Keepstar After that we got back on a titan and were bridges back to our staging Keepstar in X2-ZA5, which now does not have an hostile Keepstars within jump range. Elsewhere in the war we have been taking systems in Insmother.  PanFam has been pushing back a bit on that and has retaken a system or two on occasion.  But they owned the whole region before we showed up and now a good chunk of it is out hands. Insmother – June 9, 2025 Of course, our own structures are not perfectly safe.  PanFam did get out its titans as a show of force to smite something of ours in retaliation.  They destroyed a POS we had anchored in their staging system of G-QTSD.  Again, you take your wins where you can find them.",
