  "text": "SummaryThe first roadmap for Diablo IV is here, showing what’s to come for 2025.Game director Brent Gibson talks about the coming seasons in the Age of Hatred, and more.Sanctuary is what it is thanks to communication, so please keep that feedback coming! Diablo wouldn’t be what it is today without our players — Sanctuary belongs to you as much as it belongs to us. Every shred of feedback, every heated debate, and every shared moment in-game fuels the fire that drives how we continue to grow our game together. Today, our team released our first roadmap for Diablo IV, showcasing what’s going to come for the rest of the year. Transparency is our guiding star with its reveal, and we’re excited to pull back the curtain and deepen our conversation with you, our community, by providing a view of the path ahead. Click to expand. In the above image, you can see the next three Diablo IV seasons of 2025 — Belial’s Return, Sins of the Horadrim, and Infernal Chaos — and their respective themes of power. Alongside those seasons, we’ll be making significant, permanent updates and improvements to the base game, ranging from existing systems, keyboard and mouse support for console, and much more. You also see that we are bringing two IP collaborations into Diablo IV this year! While I won’t spoil anything here, I will say we are personally extremely excited about this, and we are thrilled to be working with universes that resonate deeply with the dark themes of the Diablo universe. Additionally, our second anniversary is coming up! Details are coming soon, but we’re very eager to celebrate two years of slaying alongside our players. Finally, this year is all building toward our next expansion, arriving in 2026. Plus, Leaderboards will be making their Diablo IV debut, so you can earn recognition for your achievements. Your thoughts on what lies beyond are crucial. We’re so thankful to be building Sanctuary alongside you, so if you have any thoughts around what you see here, please feel free to share them on our forums or on social media via X and Instagram.
