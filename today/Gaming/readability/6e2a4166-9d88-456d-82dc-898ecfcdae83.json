The NPCs that you have to meet are in the outskirts of Kyoto, albeit in opposite directions. You can see where they're located in the map below:Ise Sadatame is southeast of Kyoto, while the messenger is to the west.Ise Sadatame's locationThe first order of business is to find Ise Sadatame. He's in an area called Ogura Pond, which is southeast of Kyoto. Once you've tagged the Ogura Pond fast travel point, head north to Byodoin Temple and have a chat with Sadatame.The messenger's locationSadatame will then tell you about another NPC that you need to speak with. Now, it's time to find the messenger in Assassin's Creed Shadows. Your only clue is that he's on a bridge southeast of Arashiyama.As it just so happens, there's a river winding from Kyoto to Arashiyama, and there's a bridge that spans the gap. This is where you'll find the messenger fella.The messenger is waiting for you on Arashiyama's famous bridge.Chance meetings and the Twisted TreeAfter chatting with the messenger, you have to search for another character. Thankfully, the location is marked on the map this time. Upon reaching the area, you'll meet a man named Gennojo, who happens to have a penchant for using smoke bombs to disappear. Note that Gennojo can also be recruited as a potential ally down the line.In any case, once that encounter is done, you need to make your way to a sumo arena to watch a cutscene. A certain gentleman also makes an appearance (we don't want to spoil his identity in this guide).Gennojo is a potential ally--and romanceable option for Naoe--later on.After this brief exchange, you're then told to assassinate the Twisted Tree. No, you're not going for the Fool of the Shinbakufu yet. Instead, you have to eliminate the patriarch of a family, as well as several of his children. You can learn about all the steps in our Twisted Tree guide.Do you need more help as you continue your adventure throughout Sengoku Jidai era Japan?
