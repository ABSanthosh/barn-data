The good news is that it's still live now. All sorts of stuff is on sale, but I thought it would be neat to look at the bestsellers among IGN readers in the sale thus far. Below, you'll find the most popular deals that are still available in the sale. Without further ado, let's get to it.12 Things to Buy Before the Amazon Spring Sale EndsA whole lot of categories of items are represented in the list above. We're talking graphic novels, board games, LEGO sets, Apple products, and a whole lot more. Apple's AirPods 2 are down to their all-time low price. The board game Cascadia has been a huge seller, and it's avaliable for a terrific price. Check out our Cascadia review for details about what makes it so worthwhile. Venturing into tech products, you can save on a PlayStation Portal carrying case, one of the best SSDs for PS5, and on a microSD card (you can never have enough of these chiclet-sized wonders, imo). You can even save money on a Jurassic Park-themed version of the Game of Life. I mean, what more could you need?Chris Reed is a deals expert and commerce editor for IGN.
