  "text": "Break Like a Baby sees you and a friend becoming a pair of destructive tots trying to wreck the house before the babysitter catches you. 8pm bedtime? Not likely. Can’t enforce bedtime if the house isn’t standing by 8pm, right? As a pair of energetic twins, neither of you is in the mood to go to sleep any time soon. No, you thirst for destruction (like most children). I really do love my kids but their sole purpose in life seems to be sowing chaos and trashing the place. After playing a few rounds of this game, I have to say that I don’t blame them for loving it, though. What’s not to like about teaming up with a buddy to rip a house to pieces without any consequences? So, you and your co-op buddy are given a list of things that you just have to wreck before your parents get home. To do this, you need to crawl over to them and just pummel them to bits. The items you need to break each time change, so don’t just go around trashing things willy-nilly or you’ll never break everything in time. You also have to watch out for your babysitter, too, as they’re always on patrol and will come running if they hear you shaking the fridge apart. You need to strike hard and quickly (or take turns drawing the babysitter to different parts of the house) if you want to avoid capture. Thankfully, the free twin can break the captured one out of their crib if they’re careful. You only lose if you’re both caught and sent to bed. Break Like a Baby is silly, destructive fun for two people (and provides some good jump scares when the babysitter comes tearing your way). And again, at least I get to be the person destroying things in the house for a change. Break Like a Baby is available now (for whatever you wish to pay for it) on itch.io.
