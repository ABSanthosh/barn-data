  "text": "The sun is shining and the Dawntrail field operation and relic weapon is here, as of patch 7.25. For those wanting to get a jump on the relic grind, we got your back, as we detail how to get the Phantom relic weapon in FFXIV below.Just like other relics, the Phantom relic is no joke and it requires quite a bit of play either in the Occult Crescent (the Dawntrail field operation) or some FATE grinding in the expansion’s zones.Below we explain what FFXIV relic weapons are and how to start your Dawntrail relic weapon.Relic weapons, explainedRelic weapons are unique weapons for each job that need to be upgraded by following a series of quests. The end result? The best weapon in the Dawntrail expansion — though since all the steps aren’t out yet, you won’t be able to get there just quite yet.If this is your first relic weapon, know that you have quite the grind ahead of you, but also this stuff drops in patches, so you can do it as it releases to lessen the grind. (Or maybe you’re reading this guide years in the future and you’re gonna do it all at once!)This weapon series involves the Occult Crescent, the field operation duty for Dawntrail, though you can complete your weapon by other means, if you hate field ops.Step 1: How to get your Phantom weaponThis first step was added in patch 7.25 and the weapon is item level 745. All of these weapons are pretty unique in design, so if you don’t know which one you want to make, here’s a pretty nice video showing off all the weapons.To get your first weapon:Complete the “Dawntrail” main scenario quest.Unlock the Occult Crescent hub by completing the quest line that starts with “One Last Hurrah” in Tulliyolal.Keep completing the quests until you finish “Unfamiliar Territory.” (You can go further than this, as continuing this quest will be required to participate in the Occult Crescent, but you don’t have to do more than this for the relic weapon.)Talk to Lydirceil in the Phantom Village to start the quest “Arcane Artistry.”Obtain three of each of the six different types of demiatma — obtained either by completing FATEs and critical encounters in the Occult Crescent or by completing FATEs in the Dawntrail zones.Turn in the 18 demiatma to Gerolt.Buy three Arcanite for 500 Allagan Tomestones of Heliometry each from Ermina in the Phantom Village (1,500 tomes total).Turn in the Arcanite to Dodokkuli as the job you want the weapon for.It takes quite a few critical encounters to get a single demiatma drop, so don’t expect to just get one from each you complete. You’ll know when you get one as a pop-up will appear on your screen noting that you got a demiatma. After doing around 20 critical encounters, I walked away with about three demiatma, so it has a pretty brutal drop rate.For subsequent weapons, you will only need to repeat steps seven and eight. You will not need to grind out any more demiatmas, thank Hydaelyn.The demiatma drops from specific areas in the Occult Crescent and from specific maps. Based on our experience, as well as some crowdsourced information, here’s where to find the specific demiatma:DemiatmaOccult CrescentDawntrail zoneAzurite (periwinkle)Southeastern area (\"Crawling Death\", \"Scourge of the Mind\", and \"The Unbridled\" CEs, \"A Prying Eye\", \"The Golden Guardian\" and \"Rough Waters\" FATEs)UrqopachaVerdigris (blue)Southwestern area (\"Calamity Bound\" CE, \"A Delicate Balance\", \"Pleading Pots\", and \"Sworn to Soil\" FATEs)Kozama’ukaMalachite (green)Central western area (\"Flame of Dusk\", \"Trial by Claw\", and \"From Times Bygone\" CEs, \"An Unending Duty\" FATE)Yak T’elRealgar (orange)Northwestern area (\"Shark Attack\", \"With Extreme Prejudice\", and \"Cursed Concern\" CEs, \"The Winged Terror\" and \"Brain Drain\" FATEs)ShaaloaniCaput Mortuum (magenta)Eastern ruins area (\"Company of Stone\", \"On the Hunt\", and \"Eternal Watch\" CEs, \"Serving Darkness\" FATE)Heritage FoundOrpiment (yellow)Northeast and central areas (\"Noise Complaint\" and \"The Black Regiment\" CEs, \"Persistent Pots\", \"King of the Crescent\", and \"Fatal Allure\" FATEs)Living MemoryNote that in the aforementioned crowdsourced info, there are a few players noting that it’s possible to get other colors of demiatma from outside of their “native” area listed above. We’re not sure if this is true, but we’re investigating and will update as we discover more information.That’s all there is for now, but we can expect more relic weapon steps to roll out in later patches, alongside additions to the Occult Crescent.If that didn’t satisfy your itch, we have guides on how to make the previous relic weapons, too: Resistance (Shadowbringers), Eureka (Stormblood), Anima (Heavensward), and Zodiac (A Realm Reborn). We also have a guide for the Manderville (Endwalker) relic, but that is literally just a tome dump alongside a straight-forward quest, so that may not scratch the grinding itch you got.",
