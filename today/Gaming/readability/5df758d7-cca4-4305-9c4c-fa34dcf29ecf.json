  "text": "Image credit: Sucker Punch Those keen to hear more about Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yōtei will be able to tune in for a gameplay deep dive next month. The developer hasn't said too much about what this will involve, merely stating it will give us a look at \"new and evolved gameplay mechanics, including exploration, combat, and much more\" when the showcase airs. As for when that will be, for now we only know July, with Sucker Punch asking us all to stay tuned for more. And, stay tuned we here at Eurogamer certainly will. Along with this little nugget, the studio also shared a short teaser for Ghost of Yōtei, featuring the game's lead Atsu and what appears to be her canine companion. Can we pet them? Maybe we will find out next month! You can see the teaser below. Ghost of Yotei - State of Play Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games Ghost of Yotei - State of Play Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games. Watch on YouTube Ghost of Yōtei will launch on Playstation 5 later this year, on 2nd October. Like I said, the game will focus on Atsu and her quest for vengeance. She is hunting down a gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six, you see. \"They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived,\" Sucker Punch teased earlier this year. \"She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito.\"",
