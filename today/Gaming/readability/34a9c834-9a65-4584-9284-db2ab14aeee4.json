Image credit: Capcom / Aniplex Inc / Joycity Corporation Resident Evil Survival Unit was only unveiled last week, but already franchise owner Capcom is pulling back the curtain to give us our first look at the mobile strategy game. Survival Unit is being co-developed by Aniplex Inc and Joycity Corporation, with Capcom working in \"close collaboration\" with the studios to \"ensure authenticity and quality\". A free-to-play title, Capcom reckons it will \"offer a fresh, mobile-first gameplay experience that diverges from the traditional survival horror format of the main series\". Resident Evil Survival Unit - Official Announcement (Multi-Language Audio) Resident Evil Survival Unit - Official Announcement (Multi-Language Audio).Watch on YouTube As IGN explains it, Survival Unit's story begins with your character's recovery as an Umbrella Corp test subject. In a bid to fight back, you'll meet and recruit Resident Evil characters, upgrading their skills and inventories with the now customary visits to the Merchant. Resident Evil Survival Unit may be set in a parallel world and explore a new storyline, but players can expect to bump into familiar faces from across the main series, too, and make up their ultimate dream team, including series stalwarts Leon Kennedy and antagonist, Albert Wesker, as well as Jill Valentine, Claire Redfield, and Barry Burton. You can also connect, and compete with, other players and set up and manage a base of operations in the guise of a mansion that long-time fans may recognise. Resident Evil Survival Unit is expected to release in 2025, but we don't yet have a solid date. As for the other recently-announced Resident Evil game, Resident Evil Requiem? Anticipation is evidently high, as Capcom recently announced over a million of us have already added Resident Evil Requiem to our wishlists. We got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem last month, when Capcom introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City. The developer once considered having Leon Kennedy take on the protagonist role for Requiem, but in the end decided he was \"actually quite a bad match for horror\".",
