  "text": "Grotesqueresque is an anthology of horror tales filled with sickening pixel art monstrosities and jarring moments of terror. Ten different stories of gut-churning horror await in this compelling collection of scary experiences. Told under the guise of a variety show (definitely getting a Tales From the Crypt vibe, here), our puppet-like narrator spins all of these varied horror stories after a short introduction about what to expect. Each goes off in wildly different directions, capturing a woman seeking plastic surgery to feel beautiful, a farmer who’s gotten lucky enough to find endless apples in his orchard, and someone who just can’t sleep at night. Naturally, something awful happens to all of them in different ways. Taking a walk alone in a red-tinged forest at night wasn’t going to turn out very well, was it? Nor was creeping through the ventilation system looking for messes to clean up. Each of these stories are tinged with dread from the moment you start, but without spoiling anything, they all do it in different ways that keep the scares fresh and chilling each time. I thought a handful of extremely short horror tales might lose their punch over time, but the developer has done an excellent job here of getting under my skin in ways that felt fresh throughout. They also excel at catching me off-guard with some jarring scares to boot, ensuring I never felt safe or comfortable playing this game. Grotesqueresque offers many eerie horror tales that shock with their unsettling pixel art creatures (I never knew what to expect of the monsters in this game). The mechanics and stories keep twisting things in new ways, and the fact that you can find different endings to these disturbing tales will bring you back for another round of scary surprises. Grotesqueresque is available now (for whatever you wish to pay for it) on itch.io.
