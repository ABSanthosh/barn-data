It took a while to figure it out, to be honest. Iâ€™m feeling good about it, and I think she is too; Iâ€™m hoping it sets her up with good habits for the future. 2. Last beauty product you bought? I grabbed a cream shadow from Charlotte Tilbury, the Eyes to Mesmerise Cream Shadow in Oyster Pearl, a shimmery bronze-gold, from the Sephora fall sale. 3.

Yes, if Iâ€™m in Hawaii. ðŸ™‚ If Iâ€™m anywhere else, I need to be wearing comfortable and waterproof boots that completely shield my socks from getting wet. Otherwise, HARD NO. 5. How has your fall been so far? Honestly, so, so busy. Iâ€™ve been terribly overwhelmed and itâ€™s been hard to focus on anything, really. But every single day I tell myself to keep trying and not give up â€“ especially on the projects that I do just for me, like MBB. I try to give myself lots of grace. And I remind myself that even a little bit of progress still moves me forward. Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S.
