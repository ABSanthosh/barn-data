  "text": "Mobile port is still expected to launch April 2025. Image credit: NetEase Once Human's cross-platform test for PC and mobile is now live. Running from now until 30th March, players in Europe, Japan, and North America are able to jump into NetEase's free-to-play PvPvE sandbox action horror before the mobile port - announced back in September - launches in April 2025 and test the \"seamless\" cross-progression features across PC and mobile. Once Human | Battle Pass: Frontline Dispatch Once Human | Battle Pass: Frontline Dispatch.Watch on YouTube \"Once Human's cross-platform test uses the current global server environment that's being used by the PC version of the game,\" NetEase explains. \"This means that all of the content from the PC version, including all the Scenarios and the Visional Wheel/Lunar Oracle, can be experienced by mobile players throughout the test.\" Interested? Players are invited to sign up via a survey. I gave Once Human a modest three out of five stars when I reviewed it for Eurogamer, saying it offers a deeply moreish open world scavenge-em-up, but weak action and generic clutter hold it back. Since launch, however, NetEase has ramped up its premium in-game offerings, including cosmetic loot crates. The developer behind NetEase's survival free-to-play horror, Once Human, recently said the feedback it's received about the game's second season has been \"quite demoralising\".",
