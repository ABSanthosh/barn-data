That doesn’t mean you can’t enhance your experience even more with a few accessories. Whether you enjoy mobile gaming, want to charge your phone wirelessly, or need to protect your device from scratches, there’s an accessory out there that’s suitable for you. TL;DR – These Are the Best iPhone Accessories in 2025:The lastest iPhone lineup, the iPhone 16, comes as a rather barebones package, so you might want to grab a pair of earbuds or a wall charger. It's no secret that the best smartwatch for iPhone is Apple Watch Series 10, and you can always stay in the iOS ecosystem with Apple’s other official accessories. But going off-piste could mean enjoying some more affordable options on things like screen protectors, chargers, or even a cleaning kit to maintain your smartphone. Contributions from Georgie Peru and Rudie Obias1. Apple AirPods Pro 2Best Wireless Earbuds for iPhoneApple AirPods Pro 2Enjoy Apple’s H2 chip and experience better noise cancellation, crisp audio, and rich bass. Including four pairs of silicone tips, you can comfortably wear the Apple AirPods Pro 2 for long periods of time.Compatible Apple iPhoneiPhone 6s or newerEffective noise-cancelingSeamlessly pair with iPhoneNo high-resolution Bluetooth audioIt’s no surprise that the Apple AirPods Pro are the best wireless earbuds, especially for iPhones. They feature excellent and rich audio for music and podcasts, top-of-the-line noise canceling to block out ambient and background noise, and they sync seamlessly to the iPhone via iOS and Apple Keychain. These earbuds also have spatial audio features that make listening to your favorite music an immersive experience. These are the very best AirPods you can buy right now.Want a great iPhone earbuds alternative? IGN expert Nick Woodard did hands-on testing of the Apple AirPods 4 with ANC, giving the headphones an 8/10. He even stated the earbuds “go head-to-head in several categories with the AirPods Pro 2,” making the AirPods 4 a great lower-cost option that still seamlessly works with iPhones. 2. Smartish Slim CaseBest iPhone CaseSmartish Slim CaseLightweight protection doesn’t have to cost a lot. With a range of designs to choose from, this stylish iPhone 16 case works with MagSafe chargers and accessories.Compatible Apple iPhoneiPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, 16 Pro MaxMaterialHard plastic and rubber Absorbs shock during fallYellowing of certain color ways over timeThe iPhone is an expensive and delicate piece of tech. Although it’s less prone to shattering if dropped these days, we still recommend wrapping your phone in a lightweight, yet durable case – like the Smartish Slim Case.Made from tough hard plastic and rubber, this case features cushioned corners that absorb and disperse impact away from the phone itself to prevent cracking if dropped. It’s also designed with raised bumpers, so the display won’t sit flush with a flat surface when facedown. Meanwhile, the Smartish Slim Case is made with MagSafe built-in for wireless charging and other accessories.It comes in nine colors and styles, including black, blue, transparent, purple, and more. Plus, the case is available in various sizes to fit all the latest iPhone 16 models. 3. Anker USB-C 747 ChargerBest Wall Charger for iPhoneAnker USB-C 747 ChargerCharge up multiple devices simultaneously and experience fast charging on your iPhone.Compatible Apple iPhoneiPhone 6s or newerCharges multiple devices simultaneouslyFaster charging than standard wall chargerLarger than standard charging blockEquipped with three USB-C ports and one USB-A port, the Anker USB-C 747 Charger is the best USB-C charger you can find – ready to charge up your iPhone and a few other devices simultaneously – all while keeping compact dimensions. Delivering a total of 150W of power, it’s an absolute workhorse so it’ll have no trouble juicing up a power-hungry iPad or MacBook and your iPhone at the same time. Even with two or three devices plugged into this wall charger, an iPhone should still hit max charging speeds when connected to the charger’s USB-C port. That’s thanks to its dynamic power distribution. Considering the average charging block taps out at 20W, charging will be measurably faster. Anker also includes technology to measure temperature, keeping things safe as you juice up quickly. 4. iOttie Velox Magnetic Dash MountBest Car Mount for iPhoneiOttie Velox Magnetic Dash MountCompatible with MagSafe phone cases, this wireless charger is a must-have if you travel regularly in your car and want to keep your phone’s battery topped up.Compatible Apple iPhoneiPhone 8 or newerMaterialSoft plastic and siliconeStrong magnets hold device in placeHas wireless charging functionalityOnly compatible with MagSafe casesIt’s illegal to use your iPhone while driving – distracted driving is one of the biggest causes for accidents.

Apple MagSafe ChargerBest Wireless Charger for iPhoneApple MagSafe ChargerApple’s latest MagSafe Charger provides wireless charging up to 25W, a strong magnetic system, and Qi charging support. Compatible Apple iPhoneiPhone 12 or newer (for MagSafe)MaterialAluminum and soft plasticUp to 25W wireless charging speedsDoesn't include wall chargerPlenty of great wireless chargers are available, but when it comes to iPhones, it’s best to find a charger ready to take advantage of the MagSafe technology the phones are packing. Since Apple invented MagSafe for a stronger, more reliable connection between a wireless charger to an iPhone 12 or later, the company's latest generation of MagSafe Charger is the best, most effective option for the iPhone. The MagSafe Charger features a sleek, slim hockey-puck design with a strong magnet that aligns with the back of the iPhone for charging. The powerful connection between the two devices means there shouldn’t be any problem when picking up the phone to answer calls or checking socials while charging. The durable, high-quality materials used in its build mean the charger can handle some wear and tear too. Unlike other wireless chargers, which are often limited to 7.5W speeds when charging an iPhone, the Apple MagSafe Charger can reach up to 25W with a 30W or 35W USB-C power adapter. Unfortunately, that wall charger will need to be purchased separately. Still, this option offers excellent value, as it features Qi2 and Qi support – any device that has Qi charging can juice up wirelessly. 7. Anker MagGo Power BankBest Battery Pack for iPhoneAnker MagGo Power BankAlign this Qi2-certified, MagSafe compatible battery pack perfectly to your iPhone and charge wirelessly on the go. Compatible Apple iPhoneiPhone 12 or newer (for MagSafe)MaterialAluminum and soft plasticMagSafe compatible for secure connection to iPhoneIncludes a tiny smart displayNeed to charge up your device on the go? Skip the hassle of cable management by grabbing the Anker MagGo Power Bank instead. Similar to the Apple MagSafe Charger, this battery pack is MagSafe-compatible for a secure, stable connection to the back of your phone. Just be prepared for it to add some bulk to your device. With a 10,000mAh capacity, the Anker MagGo Power Bank can juice up your iPhone about 1.5 times before needing to be recharged itself. Thanks to the MagSafe compatibility, iPhone charging speeds hit up to 15W. If faster charging is necessary, the battery pack can also connect to an iPhone via USB-C instead, delivering up to a 27W output.But what makes the MagGo Power Bank even more of a standout is the tiny smart display on its side. The TFT screen provides handy info on battery levels and charging times, and a little kickstand holds up your phone for easy viewing when charging. Not to mention the fun color options this battery pack comes in. 8. Anker USB-C to USB-C CableBest Charging Cable for iPhoneAnker USB-C to USB-C CableAvailable in a range of lengths, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 can be charged easily and affordably with this pair of durable, braided fast charging cables.Compatible Apple iPhoneiPhone 15 or newerMaterialThermoplastic elastomers and nylonAvailable in range of sizesOnly works for newest iPhonesWhile there’s no shortage of cheap iPhone cables, the Anker USB-C to USB-C Cable is one of the best charging cables – thanks to its 6ft length and braided-nylon design for durability (it won’t fray after a few weeks of use), and its very affordable price at $16 for a two-pack. It also comes in three colors, including black, red, and silver.9. Mophie Powerstation PlusBest Portable Power Bank for iPhoneMophie Powerstation PlusThis 10,000mAh power bank has built-in cables, so you don't have to worry about forgetting them.Compatible Apple iPhoneiPhone 6s or newerDurable USB-C and Lightning cables attachedNot enough power to charge MacBookNothing is worse than running out of juice on your iPhone when you’re far away from a wall outlet. For a cable-powered portable charger, the Mophie Powerstation Plus, remedies this problem. With it comes a 10,000mAh battery for an over a full extra charge to your phone. But what makes this power bank a real standout is the inclusion of built-in, durable USB-C and Lightning cables that tuck away neatly when not in use. It’s perfect for those constantly losing and tangling wires. Beyond those cables, an additional USB-C port is provided to juice up a third device. However, to enjoy up to 30W charging speeds from the USB-C or 20W from the Lightning cable, only one device can be charged at a time. That’s plenty of power for an iPhone or iPad. Just don’t expect to charge a MacBook. Since the Mophie Powerstation Plus will be spending lots of time getting tossed in bags and pockets to take on the go, the solid aluminum frame and compact build are ideal. Four tiny indicator lights on the side of the power bank also let you know when it’s time for the battery itself to get juiced up. Razer Kishi Ultra – Photos10. Razer Kishi UltraBest iPhone Gaming ControllerRazer Kishi UltraThe Razer Kishi Ultra features console-quality controls, a comfortable grip, and a feature-rich app.Compatible Apple iPhoneiPhone 15, iPhone 16Customizable via the Razer Nexus appSome features only work with Android It’s no secret that iPhones weren't always the top gaming phones. Still, Apple has made some headway with the A18 chips found in the iPhone 16 models, especially the extra graphics core living in the iPhone 16 Pro Max. That’s coupled with higher-tier games coming to iOS like Assassin’s Creed Mirage and Resident Evil. But to really amp up that iPhone gaming experience an extra notch, grabbing the best phone controller is the way to goWe reviewed the Razer Kishi Ultra and absolutely loved this phone controller. It connects directly to iPhone 16 and 15 models via USB-C for zero latency when you play, while the controller stretches, flanking the screen for a comfortable grip. On it comes full-size analog sticks, an 8-way D-pad, and hall-effect triggers. But the star of the show is the ultra-responsive and clicky Mecha-Tactile buttons. L4 and R4 buttons are also ready for some macro inputs. It's a major upgrade from just tapping away at the screen, and you can even use this controller away from your phone by connecting to a PC or iPad via USB-C. The Razer Nexus app makes it simple to tinker with the different buttons and controls. You can remap buttons, adjust dead zones, swap RGB lighting, and more. Unfortunately, using the Kishi Ultra with iOS is slightly more limited than with Android, so Sensa HD Haptics and Virtual Controller Mode aren’t available. Still, Razer makes it simple to access Apple Arcade, Steam Link, Xbox Game Pass, and PlayStation Remote Play, so you can get gaming quickly on your iPhone. 11. JBL Go 3Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker for iPhoneJBL Go 3Weighing less than half a pound with a tiny form factor to toss in a bag, this option also has a strap and IP67 rating for portability, though there’s only a 5-hour battery life.Compatible Apple iPhoneiPhone 6s or newerLimiting 5 hour battery lifePair your iPhone with the JBL Go 3 via Bluetooth for a powerful sonic punch when on the go. Whether you’re streaming podcasts or music, the soundstage is wide with crisp, rich audio despite this speaker's compact design. And when we say “compact,” we mean it. It weighs less than half a pound and measures just 3.6x2.7x1.6 inches, making it easy to toss in a bag or even throw in a pocket. Adding more reasons why the JBL Go 3 earns the title as the best Bluetooth speaker for portability is its IP67 rating. It’s both waterproof and dustproof, so a little dirt and rain won’t stop the music whether you're at the beach, by the pool, on a picnic, or around the campfire. The only real downside is the slightly limiting five-hour battery life. 12. Ecasp Cleaner KitBest Cleaning Kit for iPhoneEcasp Cleaner KitKeep all of the ports on your iPhone free of dust and dirt with this handy little cleaning kit. It can even restore charging cables to their former glory after being buried at the bottom of your bag.Compatible Apple iPhoneAll modelsMaterialMetal and soft velvetGreat for cleaning various devicesSince you touch your phone all day and even press it against your face when making phone calls, it’s a good idea to clean it every once in a while. Ecasp Cleaner Kit comes with just about everything you need to keep your device clean and working fantastically. It’s a multi-tool set to clean the display, port, edges, and more. The kit is also good for cleaning a pair of Apple AirPods, an Apple Watch, an iPad, and cables.iPhone Accessories FAQWhat accessories come with an iPhone?Once upon a time, buying an iPhone meant getting a whole box of goodies. Earlier models of the iPhone, such as the iPhone X, came with wired Apple earbuds, a Lightning to 3.55mm headphone jack adapter, and a power adapter. However, as part of Apple’s new environmental goals, more recent iPhone models only come with the USB-C charging cable (iPhone 15 and later), with an included recommendation that purchasers “re-use your current USB-A to lightning cables, power adapters, and headphones.”Can I use any USB-C charger for my iPhone? The occasional rumor will circulate that it’s bad form to use non-Apple chargers on your iPhone. This is generally not true, as any compabitle cable will work to power your phone, but there are some stipulations to pay attention to. If you want to guarantee you get the highest quality of charging power (and not bunk cords that damage your device's battery), check whether a charger is \"MFi-certified,\" meaning it was made for iPhone and certified by Apple. What gaming accessories are good for iPhones?As big studios continue to release mobile versions of their most popular games, you may be wondering what you can do to optimize your iPhone gaming experience. While the Razer Kishi Ultra is our pick for the best gaming accessory, other options are on the market, including iPhone-compatible wireless gaming controllers. You can even use Playstation's Remote Play app alongside a Sony controller and the best wireless headphones to bring the console experience to your Apple device.

However, to enjoy up to 30W charging speeds from the USB-C or 20W from the Lightning cable, only one device can be charged at a time. That’s plenty of power for an iPhone or iPad.
