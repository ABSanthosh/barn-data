Just last year, Onyx Storm was the second best-selling book of the entire year and it didn't even come out until January of this year. And when it did come out, it became the fastest-selling novel for adults of the past 20 years. Now, you can pick up all three books in the series – Fourth Wing, Iron Flame, and Onyx Storm – in Amazon's buy two get one 50% off promotion.The Empyrean Series Is Discounted at Amazon TodayFourth WingIron FlameOnyx Storm (Deluxe Limited Edition)The discounts and promotion only include the hardcover editions of each of these books, rather than the paperback or Kindle versions.

In short, there are elements familiar to the Harry Potter books, romance similar to the Twilight series, and dragons similar to the Inheritance Cycle. Reading these books feels familiar, and yet somehow very new. Here's a quick synopsis of the series below:The story follows Violet Sorrengail, a seemingly fragile young girl who has been forced by her powerful mother to enter into the very dangerous academy of dragon riders. As she finds ways to overcome her weaknesses and survive, Violet must also battle her own complex emotions about her mother, her old friend, and a boy she thinks wants nothing more than to see her dead. All the while, there's more going on with the dragons and her world than meets the eye, and she finds herself at the center of it all while in the heat of an epic romance.Looking for more Presidents' Day sales like this?
