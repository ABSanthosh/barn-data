  "text": "On Friday I had started a post that was meant to sum up how the invasion was going in Insmother and problems we were facing on the western front of the Imperium.  There was data like this to explain. The state of sov changes – June 13, 2025 We were sweeping up in Insmother, but The Initiative had taken ZXB in Delve and Drake Lair, which I will guess is a PanFam pet, managed to grab another system in the region, so it looked like we were going to have to shift focus and spend more time there. Then we had the Fireside on Saturday where Asher announced we were giving up on Delve and Querious and that the Imperium was moving across the regional gates to base ourselves more in the southeast of null sec, with Goonswarm Federation moving forward to live in Insmother. So yeah, that shook things up a bit and the initial version of my post went into the trash, much of it having largely been overtaken by events.  You can see this change condensed into two comments I left on a post over at TNG.  What a difference a day makes. Anyway, back to the drawing board. The State of Insmother So I’ll start again with the Insmother region.  The stated goal of the war was the conquest of the region, and at this point PanFam has been evicted.  They hold no more sovereignty in the region. Insmother – June 15, 2025 They are doing some counter work, trying to entosis a few systems to set timers, but that is barely a harassment level of effort.  They’re out, GSF and Sons of Bane, members of the Imperium since March, are in, and we’re slowly going around and melting any remaining structures we cannot simply claim. (You can now grab Skyhooks when you take the sov.) Delve and Querious Then there are the regions on the western flank of the coalition.  PanFam has been doing harassment level efforts against sovereignty and structures from NPC Delve for a while now.  They have had Fraternity helping them a bit, but of late The Initiative have joined in on the attack, taking the system ZXB-VC, which is linked by a regional gate to their home in Fountain, giving them a springboard to attack Brave more freely. As I have mentioned in the past, we have a doctrine set aside for defending the west, Control Alt Delve, which are Alpha clones that are dedicated to that corp and nothing else, so when needed we can log them in and have a defense fleet ready to go.  Most days us forming up big enough sees PanFam standing down.  They generally do not want risk in fights and obsess  about winning the ISK war rather than winning the objective.  That means a large percentage of the time we simply have to form up to win the objective.  We’re always objective first, ISK later. Sitting on a Fort watching it repair, PanFam nowhere to be seen So the plan was to be using those a lot more.  But with the announcement of the move, that now has an end date.  Now the plan is to stand up a lot more fleets in the west to cover the initial move ops while protecting systems and structures necessary to facilitate the move and thwarting PanFam whenever we can. That means a lot more focus on Delve and Querious over the next few weeks. The Move This is the big deal for the week. For Goons, there is something of a symmetry of history in moving back into C-J6MT, the system where they and Red Alliance formed their initial pact and where the Russians taught Goons how to fight and succeed in null sec.  This was the second home for Goons in null sec, after S-U8A4 in Syndicate.  So memories for some. Also, it won’t be a tough move for us, there being no regional gate we’ll need to take.  It can be all safe cynos from UALX-3 to C-J6MT. Which doesn’t mean I am happy or looking forward to the move.  But at least I shed a bunch of stuff on the last move.  Still, I have somehow accumulated more stuff in just a few months and now I have to get it all moved.  Eventually.  I did blow 9.2 billion ISK on a jump freighter just to make myself more able to move at my own pace. Undocking in my new ship I went with the Ark to keep my jump fuel aligned with the Apostle and Archon.  I am all in on Amarr capitals I guess.  Also, I probably would have spent much less than that just using a shipping service, but the price of a jump freighter hasn’t changed much in a decade either, so I can get my money back on the hull at some future date. For our allies in Delve and Querious, this is going to be a huge pain in the ass and a rush to boot.  They will need to get through the regional gate to Catch before they’ll be able to travel semi-safely.  This has led to some panic and bad decisions as people try to consolidate for the move.  This poor pilot lost their Avalache gating in Querious.  Ouch.  There will be more of that, as PanFam is hunting for strays and has eyes in a lot of systems. Soon to be moving from Delve I expect cover ops and convoys to be running this week as we try to help our allies move east.  What will become of Delve and Querious… we shall see.  Also Period Basis.  There is a theory that Dracarys will be able to hold onto that space… maybe due to its lack of desirability.  But that theory has yet to be put to the test. That Keepstar in Delve Also on the list of difficulties is the Keepstar in 1DQ1-A, named in memory of Innominate, who passed last year. The view from 1DQ1-A – World War Bee memories We were going to leave it up as a memorial, but if we’re leaving the space then we cannot expect it to not be destroyed.  Unanchoring it… well, that isn’t going to be possible.  We taught PAPI that lesson hard at the end of World War Bee when they tried to unanchor their structures to carry them back home with their retreat.  It is easy to shoot them, stop the process, and keep the structure held in position indefinitely.  PanFam and The Initiative will both be invested in keeping us from carrying it off. So we’re going to blow it up ourselves, a Viking funeral for our old home in Delve. Which brings us to another tricky bit; there is a ton of stuff in that Keepstar.  Goods, ships, clones with implants, a lot of stuff is going to be destroyed or moved to asset safety. While 1DQ1-A wasn’t our first home in Delve back in 2016, we had been fully there for a good three years when World War Bee broke out.  That was forced a lot of us to consolidate everything they had in the region into that one Keepstar, which was also stocked for a final siege that never materialized.  And even with the move last summer, a lot of people just left stuff behind. So when that Keepstar blows up, the asset safety load… well, people in the know expect that CCP might have to delay it and run asset safety at downtime to keep the game going.  Anyway, we’ll find out when it happens.  We might crash the server.  Or maybe it will just work. PanFam in Etherium Reach And then there is PanFam, who now has us living on their southern doorstep.  There are no expendable allies or rental space or flood plains left to dismiss as having no value.  They were once again willing to lose space on the theory that they would just take it back when Goons got bored… and once again, after taking the space, we moved right in to live in the space. Surprise!  Again! I guess there was some logic in thinking that we had just moved, so we wouldn’t do it again so soon.  That idea fell apart on Saturday.  I’d like to know how Gobbins really reacted when he heard the news… but all we’ll get from that side is spin. So now, for them, the best case is that we’re an annoyance that won’t go away and they have to keep their operations staged in G-QTSD to counter the potential threat.  Worst case… well, the mind can wander. So far the main response, aside from entosis harassment, has been a pile of deployable bubbles on the gate to Insmother, something to keep the curious away at best. A very PanFam welcome On Saturday we went through with 150 Vultures, shot a bunch of the bubbles, then ran around shooting things in their space.  There was no response. An Ansiblex in Etherium Reach getting hit by us Will that change?  We shall see. Summary We’re not getting the summer war that many wanted.  As PanFam has repeatedly misjudged us, thinking that we will behave as they want, or at least as they would, so we have failed to calculate correctly how PanFam will respond. We expected a fight and a summer of war and… we reached our goal in a few weeks.  The invasion was announced on May 24th and the last bit of effective resistance by PanFam was around the anchoring of the siege Fortzars back during the first week of June. There will still be a lot of activity over the summer.  Move ops, the evacuation of Delve and Querious, the build up in Insmother, and the Imperium starting to test PanFam on their boarder.   Will they respond?  Fight?  Pull back? The joke now is that we’re going to have to keep chasing them anti-clockwise around null sec until we end up having to re-take Delve again.  We shall see what the future holds. Finally… is it more than a coincidence that the SKINs on sale in the in-game store all happen to be Imperium doctrine ships? Seriously, we’re heavy on Caldari currently Okay, maybe not the Barghest… but Kun’mi is always flying one.  He is as sold on that hull as Baltec1 was on the Megathron.  I think that counts.",

we’ll need to take.  It can be all safe cynos from UALX-3 to C-J6MT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich doesn’t mean I am happy or looking forward to the move.  But at least I shed a bunch of stuff on the last move.  Still, I have somehow accumulated more stuff in just a few months and now I have to get it all moved.  Eventually.  I did blow 9.2 billion ISK on a jump freighter just to make myself more able to move at my own pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_135936\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

id=\"caption-attachment-85568\"\u003eThe view from 1DQ1-A – World War Bee memories\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were going to leave it up as a memorial, but if we’re leaving the space then we cannot expect it to not be destroyed.  Unanchoring it… well, that isn’t going to be possible.  We taught PAPI that lesson hard at the end of World War Bee when they tried to unanchor their structures to carry them back home with their retreat.  It is easy to shoot them, stop the process, and keep the structure held in position indefinitely.  PanFam and The Initiative will both be invested in keeping us from carrying it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we’re going to blow it up ourselves, a Viking funeral for our old home in Delve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich brings us to another tricky bit; there is a ton of stuff in that Keepstar.  Goods, ships, clones with implants, a lot of stuff is going to be destroyed or moved to asset safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile 1DQ1-A wasn’t our first home in Delve back in 2016, we had been fully there for a good three years when World War Bee broke out.  That was forced a lot of us to consolidate everything they had in the region into that one Keepstar, which was also stocked for a final siege that never materialized.  And even with the move last summer, a lot of people just left stuff behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when that Keepstar blows up, the asset safety load… well, people in the know expect that CCP might have to delay it and run asset safety at downtime to keep the game going.  Anyway, we’ll find out when it happens.  We might crash the server.  Or maybe it will just work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePanFam in Etherium Reach\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there is PanFam, who now has us living on their southern doorstep.  There are no expendable allies or rental space or flood plains left to dismiss as having no value.  They were once again willing to lose space on the theory that they would just take it back when Goons got bored… and once again, after taking the space, we moved right in to live in the space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprise!  Again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess there was some logic in thinking that we had just moved, so we wouldn’t do it again so soon.  That idea \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/06/14/the-imperium-is-moving-east-leaving-delve-and-querious-with-goonswarm-moving-into-insmother/\"\u003efell apart on

that we’re an annoyance that won’t go away and they have to keep their operations staged in G-QTSD to counter the potential threat.  Worst case… well, the mind can wander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far the main response, aside from entosis harassment, has been a pile of deployable bubbles on the gate to Insmother, something to keep the curious away at
