It’ll be featured during a Max Battle Weekend event, running from April 26 at 6 a.m. until April 27 at 9 p.m. in your local time.During this event, you’ll be able to claim more Max Particles each day (up to 1,600 from 800), you’ll get more Max Particles from Power Spots, the amount you have to walk to get particles will be cut down to 1/4, and Power Spots will refresh more often.From April 21 until the Max Battle Weekend ends, the particle cost to power up Max Moves has also been cut to 3/4 the usual amount, so it’s a great time to build some counters.Below, we list out some general Max Battle tips and counters for Dynamax Entei in Pokémon Go.Table of ContentsDynamax Entei weaknessDynamax Entei best countersGeneral Max Battle TipsDynamax Entei weaknessEntei is a solo fire-type Pokémon, so it has quite a few weaknesses: ground-, rock-, and water-type moves. There are a few Pokémon we could use at this point to take it down, which is nice (in comparison to some other big targets we’ve had, that only have one or two viable counters).All of that said, Entei will take less damage from bug-, steel-, fire-, grass-, ice-, and fairy-type moves, so you shouldn’t really use those unless you have to use them to build up your gauge.Dynamax Entei best countersFor attackers, try to bring at least one of the following with its max attack built up:Gigantamax Kingler with Metal ClawDynamax Inteleon with Water GunDynamax Excadrill with Mud ShotDynamax Kingler with BubbleGigantamax Blastoise with Water GunThis time around, none of Entei’s moves should cause any of these great distress, though you shouldn’t really be using these outside of the Dynamax/Gigantamax phase to dish damage.For tanks, you’ll want to bring one or two of the following with Max Guard/Spirit leveled up:Dynamax Blissey with PoundDynamax/Gigantamax Blastoise with Water GunGigantamax Snorlax with LickNotably there is a Timed Research set that rewards you with a Dynamax Sobble encounter, Sobble Candy, and tons of particles to help you get an Inteleon, if you want. Note that Inteleon will get a Gigantamax form down the line, so I only recommend investing in this if you have tons of Sobble Candy to spare.Ultimately, as usual, just bring the strongest Pokémon that you have to help contribute to the group. If you only have a Dynamax Sobble as a type-based counter, but you have a build Dynamax Gengar, you should just bring the Gengar.General Max Battle TipsIf you’ve been struggling in Max Battles, here are some general tips to survive — and make sure you’re an asset to your team. While Gigantamax Battles are tough, a Legendary Max Battle shouldn’t be as tough as that. You can slack a little, but you should still heed our advice:Make sure you have enough players. High-efficiency players with maxed out investments will likely be able to solo Entei, but this isn’t going to be realistic for most people. Try to go at it with three other players for the highest chance of winning. Note that unlike Gigantamax Pokémon, the Dynamax Legendary Pokémon have a max party size of four (rather than 40).Don’t sleep on Max Spirit and Max Guard. Teams work best when there’s a variety of moves, not just maxed-out attacks. Each player should bring Pokémon with the defensive and healing moves unlocked as well. Max Guard will focus single-target damage towards you and reduce the damage taken and Max Spirit will heal the whole party, so these moves are really important to make sure your damage-dealers can keep dishing.Remember to swap to super effective moves when it’s time to Dynamax. For Dynamax Pokémon, their max moves are determined by whatever type their fast move is. This means if you have a Cryogonal with Frost Breath, it will know Max Hailstorm. A Gengar with Lick will know Max Phantasm. Take advantage of this and make sure to swap to a Pokémon that will deal super effective damage to your target before Dynamaxing, if you can.Focus on your fast moves. You want to spam your fast moves to build up that Dynamax meter and often times, using your charge move is actually a DPS loss when compared to the damage you could be doing with your max move will be. Spam those attacks!Level up a few ‘mons, but you don’t have to go too hard. Depending on your group size, you absolutely do not need to max out all your Dynamax Pokémon to level 40-50. While this will make it easier on the rest of your group, if this isn’t an investment you can make, you don’t have to stress about it. Power things up as high as you can afford to, but don’t fret if you don’t have a maxed out Pokémon.All that said, make sure to come as prepared as you can be. This is a team effort and there’s a chance that a full group of four can still fail. Do not just bring your unleveled Dynamax Wooloo expecting a free ride to a powerful Pokémon. (After all, if everyone does that, then you certainly won’t clear the battle.) Again, you don’t have to completely max out your Pokémon, but it will be better for everyone involved if you bring something helpful to the table.Keep your eye out for a shiny Entei! If you clear the raid, there is a chance that the Entei you catch will be shiny — which also means it’ll be a guaranteed catch. Use a Pinap Berry to score extra candy if you get lucky enough to find a sparkly Entei.Graphic: Julia Lee/Polygon | Source images: Niantic",
