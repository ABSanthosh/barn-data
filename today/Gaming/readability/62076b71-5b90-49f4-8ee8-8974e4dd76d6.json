Fantasy Critic League – Like Fantasy Football, but for Video Games When we left off at week six, the scores were arrayed as below. The standings for Week 6 During the week we had one big release update: Dune: Awakening Picked by Crash and Burn Games (Shawn) Counter Picked by Slightly Scuffed Studios (Kluwes)] Release date changed from ‘Early 2025’ to ‘Tuesday, May 20, 2025’. Do that now has a set in stone launch date.  It is also a title I am interested in, though Funcom sounds like they have decided not to go the Conan Exiles route, at least initially, and allow private servers.  Instead, it will be more of an MMO where you need to share space with strangers.  We shall see. We also had two titles release.   Avowed was already on the board last week with a score. Avowed [Picked by Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey)] Now has a score of 80.6 The score has not changed since, but once it released the 11 points it was worth was applied. Then I have a title release this past week as well. Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii [Picked by TAGN HQ (Wilhelm)] Now has a score of 80.7 I was hoping for a bit more from a mix of pirates, Yakuza, and Hawaii… I mean, even Yahtzee (mostly) liked the game and when does that happen… but it landed at 10 points on my total. No other scores changed over the course of the week, which left us with the following standings. The standings for Week 7 Kluwes remained at the top of the stack for a second week. Despite having three titles now on the scoreboard, one more than anybody else, I only managed to claw my way up to second place.  Sniper Elite: Resistance ending up being a 3 point score is not helping me. And Archey made it up to third position on the strength of Avowed launching. Meanwhile, the point projections still put me down as a candidate for 9th out of ten.  We shall see. We did have some bid action in week seven, with three titles in play.  The results of the bidding were: Lies of P: Overture Won by Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane) with a bid of $15 Crash and Burn Games (Shawn)’s bid of $1 did not succeed: Publisher was outbid. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves Won by Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey) with a bid of $2 Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game Won by Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey) with a bid of $5 Cyanbane paid the money and ended up with Lies of P: Overture, while Archey added two titles to his lineup. Coming up for week 8, there is just one title set to launch on Friday. Coming up for Week 8 Monster Hunter Wilds will be the first title to land for Shintar, and it could be a big one. And then in week 9 we will have three releases.  We will see how  that shakes up the rankings.",
