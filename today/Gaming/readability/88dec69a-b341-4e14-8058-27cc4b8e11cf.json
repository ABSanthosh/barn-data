Adapted from the award-winning board game from Tabletop Tycoon, Everdell is a fantastical city building game combining worker placement and strategic card play to create a new civilization. Gather resources to build fanciful Constructions and recruit colorful Critters to make your city thrive. Each card in your city scores points, and after four seasons have passed the highest-scoring city wins! Face off against other founders in cross-platform multiplayer games, or test your civic wits with AI play and Solo Challenges! On each turn, you'll take one of three actions: 1.) Place a Worker. Send one of your helpful workers out into the valley to gather resources! Berries, Twigs, Resin, Pebbles...and of course Cards! You'll need them all to help your new civilization grow. 2.) Play a Card. Your city can hold up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. Cards generate resources, open up new abilities, and score points to win the game! Discover combos and synergies to race past your opponents. 3.) Prepare for the Next Season. When the seasons change, your workers come home and get ready for the next round. But plan your city carefully! After four seasons, the Winter Moon returns and the game will end. There are buildings to construct, lively characters to meet, events to host— you will have a busy year ahead of you! Will the sun shine brightest on your city before the winter moon rises? Welcome to Everdell! TouchArcade Rating:Unrated Compatibility:HD Universal Does anyone know it support Japanese? (Japanese - 日本語 in the settings?) edit:it happens later they said Oh wow this looks great. Reminds me of wingspan. I may need to get this. We’ll it’s a great game much like wingspan but the wingspan app is just more intuitive especially on a phone. I’m usually pretty impressed with direwolf digital and I’m not saying this is terrible but it needs some work to get it feeling good on a touchscreen. For one there’s a lot of info on the screen and even zooming in I can’t read some of the cards. You also have to hold the card to see what it does instead of a tap and tap to close. I think on iPad this maybe fine but know what you’re getting into on a phone. I have a 13 pro max and I can’t imagine this being fun to play on something smaller. I hope they address these issues because it’s a super fun board game. That’s a concern. I don’t own this (yet), but if you take the video in the link elcrazy posted, which I believe is PC, play it on a phone, and then look at the pictures shown in the AppStore, they seem to match up UI size wise, leading me to think perhaps No or very little UI optimisation was done between PC and mobile. ie Mobile looks to be just a direct reflection of PC on a much (much) smaller screen. And that said, watching the PC video, even detail on the board on PC needs to be zoomed up to for viewing (and has a zoom function to do so). hmmmmm. Will be watching on.. Yeah basically baldurs gate dilemma on iOS. (Iphone)It’s playable but is that good enough? Some people don’t care and I used to be that way but nowadays I prefer to not have to fight the game I’m trying to enjoy. I’m pretty sure direwolf will iron it out though. Does anyone know if multiplayer is async for both matchmaking and play? (Sad to have to ask this for Direwolf, but Wings wasn’t ) I caved and bought this for my Xs max, and have now played a few games. I honestly never thought I’d say this for a Dire wolf game but I kind of regret buying it. Even on the max phone screen everything is just tiny, and zooming in barely helps. The small scale of everything just makes playing feel like a bit of a chore. When placed into your meadow, the cards have tiny artwork that just doesn’t really help because you can’t really see it all that well. It basically becomes kind of an exercise of remembering what’s in your meadow, else go tap and hold on it all again to remind you. A big part of the game is working with cards that synergize together and this is represented by small words or symbols on cards. In real life you can see this at a glance, but in this version, you kind of have to already know it well, or tap and hold around to determine what works with what. It’s all just….so tiny!! The bad thing is, it's a beautiful, well done game but is too small to appreciate it. The cards on the board are incredibly small with no ability to see the artwork. I do have a ipad, maybe better there. It could be improved on. There are several board game apps with similar set-ups that do not suffer from being painfully small (Evolution for example). I agree. I think as a (potentially) quick solution, just allowing us to zoom in even further might go a long way to improving legibility, even recognising we lose the field of view. Right now, the zoom level for my opinion barely improves much, I still need to tap and hold to just even read the names of the cards. The board looks beautiful, it really does. But geez there is a tonne of wasted space. They’ve obviously tried to capture the look and feel of the board game layout which is often what everyone talks about in desire for digital adaptations of boardgames. But for mine, for this case, in doing so, in making the game look beautiful and feel real, legibility has totally lost out, at least on max phones. Wow I can’t imagine this on anything smaller. FYI, the latest update has improved the UI scale a fair bit. You can now zoom in a lot more and cards display bigger when tapped for enlarge, plus I think icons are shown larger on cards. Seen this is on sale and has had lots of updates. Are peoples gripes fixed now? Share This Page",

I honestly never thought I’d say this for a Dire wolf game but I kind of regret buying it. Even on the max phone screen everything is just tiny, and zooming in barely helps. The small scale of everything just makes playing feel like a bit of a chore. When placed into your meadow, the cards have tiny artwork that just doesn’t really help because you can’t really see it all that well. It basically becomes kind of an exercise of remembering what’s in your meadow, else go tap and hold on it all again to remind you.\u003cbr/\u003e\nA big part of the game is working with cards that synergize together and this is represented by small words or symbols on cards.
