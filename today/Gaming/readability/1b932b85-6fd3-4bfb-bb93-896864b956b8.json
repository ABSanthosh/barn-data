  "text": "Hey everyone, Game Director Alex Cox here again to break down another look at Mafia: The Old Country, following the Gameplay Trailer breakdown back in May. As with every Mafia title, the team at Hangar 13 has been hard at work ensuring that this all-new entry set in 1900s Sicily elevates and honors the classic gameplay pillars fans know and love.  In this video series (stay tuned for more updates soon), we’re showing off several key aspects of this updated gameplay through the lens of Enzo’s experience as a newly enlisted member of the Mafia. Each entry will be narrated by a different figure in the Torrisi crime family, beginning with the Don himself. Family responsibilities  Being part of the Torrisi crime family comes with certain obligations. In this video, you’ll get a taste of what’s expected from those who join, especially new soldatos who have yet to prove themselves. We begin with the Don asking Enzo to “send a message” that says “Torrisi takes care of his family and affairs.” How you carry out duties like these will vary throughout the story, as next we see Enzo collecting a protection payment at gunpoint before fearlessly enacting the Don’s will in a bloody knife duel.  Each task Enzo undertakes on behalf of the Family will show off his unflinching tenacity and the range of his abilities, whether he’s leaping across rooftops on foot, pursuing cars through the country on horseback, or skulking into hostile territory to dispatch enemies silently or guns-blazing. We then glimpse Enzo openly strolling through a bustling San Celeste and striking at enemies from the shadows underground; this section also gives you a look at Instinct mode, which lets you detect foes through environmental obstacles. Cut to Enzo continuing to lethally stalk and doggedly pursue enemies across the Valle Dorate, giving us a sense of the many high-stakes jobs he’ll undertake for the Family.  I’ll have to stop there to avoid giving too much away, but as always, it’s a thrill to unveil more of this gripping Sicilian crime drama as the team refines all the finishing touches. Stay tuned for more deep dives into the game soon. We can’t wait for Mafia: The Old Country to be in your hands soon when it launches on August 8. The game is available for pre-order now on PlayStation 5. Trending Stories",
