The S90C uses Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. It's generally considered superior to LG's \"Evo\" technology found on the C-series TVs, which attempt to do the same thing. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. At the moment, there's no better panel technology that's readily available at a reasonable price.OLED technology aside, the Samsung S90C also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz (rare in a 2023 TV) as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports for running 4K at 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. The S90C also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode.Despite being a generation old, the S90C is still easily one of the best gaming TVs on the market right now. It's currently priced the same as this 65\" LG C3 4K OLED TV deal. If I had to choose, I'd go with this TV over the LG C3. If you're looking for a less expensive TV or one of a different size, check out the rest of the best TV deals.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
