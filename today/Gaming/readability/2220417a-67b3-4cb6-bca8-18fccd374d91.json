  "description": "Metaphor: ReFantazio features a job system referred to as Archetypes, which allows you to swap any of your party members to any Archetype pretty freely. While there are some requirements to use the advanced Archetypes, you will want to swap out Archetypes frequently. In some cases, like certain side dungeons, there are specific Archetypes that will be recommended based on the enemy weaknesses found there, but you can also ignore that if you like your setup. One of the most important factors for determining your team composition is the synthesis abilities that become available when you have specific Archetypes present in your party.Mage with Seeker, Healer, or MageThe Mage Archetype tree is incredibly powerful, especially early on, since it has access to fire, ice, and electric attacks, which allows you to target a variety of enemy weaknesses. However, the abilities the Mage and its advanced versions can use only targets a single enemy. If you want to use a version that can target all enemies at once, you will need to use the Synthesis version of these abilities, which only becomes available if you have another Mage, a Seeker, or a Healer present. Of those three options, the best to go with is the Healer since the Healer gets to use a light damage attack that targets all enemies if a Mage is present.Knight with back row damage dealersThe Knight is an excellent class that can fit into many team compositions since the Knight is a great tank. If you need to bring along multiple back-row damage dealers, like the Mage, Gunner, Healer, or Summoner, the Knight can get the attention of enemies to keep your squishy party members safe from danger. Even if the Knight's pierce damage isn't effective against the enemies you are fighting, focusing purely on defense can keep your party alive against tough enemies.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Now Playing: Metaphor: ReFantazio Review Knight with back row damage dealersThe Knight is an excellent class that can fit into many team compositions since the Knight is a great tank. If you need to bring along multiple back-row damage dealers, like the Mage, Gunner, Healer, or Summoner, the Knight can get the attention of enemies to keep your squishy party members safe from danger. Even if the Knight's pierce damage isn't effective against the enemies you are fighting, focusing purely on defense can keep your party alive against tough enemies.Summoner and Masked DancerPerhaps one of the best combinations in Metaphor: ReFantazio, the Summoner and Masked Dancer duo is incredibly powerful. The Masked Dancer gains access to abilities that inflict one-time elemental weaknesses to enemies, and the Summoner has access to the largest variety of elemental attacks in the game. That means you can make all of your enemies weak to a specific element, like ice, and immediately dish out a high-damage ice attack that hits all enemies, dealing big damage and letting you take more turns. An important part of this comp is making sure you have the correct Vessels and Masks to take advantage of this. Make sure to craft these items in Akademia whenever you have the materials.Gunner with Gunner, Faker, or SummonerPierce physical damage is the least common of the three physical attack types, so whenever you have to deal with a dungeon featuring a large number of monsters with a weakness to Pierce, the Gunner is your best fit. If you have another Gunner, a Faker, or a Summoner present, you can use the Synthesis ability Wild Barrage, which hits all enemies with Pierce damage multiple times.Berserker with KnightThe Berserker can access two Strike damage synthesis abilities that deal massive damage, as long as a Knight is present. These two abilities, Wanton Destruction and Battlecry Tackle, have one Archetype overlap, which is the Knight. Wanton Destruction, in particular, is great, because it deals extreme physical Strike damage and it inflicts a one-time weakness to Strike. After the first use, you can continually use it every turn without losing any turn icons thanks to the weakness, making it great for tough enemies with a large amount of health.TricksterThe Trickster, the advanced version of the Faker, has access to an extreme physical Almighty attack that doesn't consume MP. Almighty damage is a special kind of damage that enemies cannot have resistance to, but they also can't be weak to. This makes it useful for enemies without weaknesses, and this special move also doesn't use MP, making it great for conserving MP in a long dungeon. To use this synthesis ability you need to have two allies in with the correct Archetypes. The first ally needs to be a Knight, Healer, or Commander, with the second ally using Thief, Faker, or Merchant.Brawler, Merchant, HealerThe Brawler, Merchant, and Healer combination gives you access to a couple of powerful Almighty attacks from the Merchant and several light attacks, as well. The Almighty attacks from the Merchant do cost money to use, but this means that they don't cost MP, a trade-off you might be willing to make late into Metaphor: ReFantazio. The powerful light attacks are great to have, since your options for high damage light attacks are fairly limited.Whatever the information saysFor the majority of main and side dungeons in Metaphor: ReFantazio, you can purchase information about the monsters in each dungeon from an informant. This information usually tells you what the enemies' weaknesses are, but if you go to your requests list, it will also add a recommended Archetypes section to the description. These are always the best possible setups, especially since it usually only recommends a couple Archetypes and not a full party of four, but you will have access to most of the enemy weaknesses, making it a nice play to start if you aren't sure what party setup to go with.

dealers\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe Knight is an excellent class that can fit into many team compositions since the Knight is a great tank. If you need to bring along multiple back-row damage dealers, like the Mage, Gunner, Healer, or Summoner, the Knight can get the attention of enemies to keep your squishy party members safe from danger. Even if the Knight\u0026#39;s pierce damage isn\u0026#39;t effective against the enemies you are fighting, focusing purely on defense can keep your party alive against tough enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSummoner and Masked Dancer\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePerhaps one of the best combinations in Metaphor: ReFantazio, the Summoner and Masked Dancer duo is incredibly powerful. The Masked Dancer gains access to abilities that inflict one-time elemental weaknesses to enemies\u003cstrong\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e and the Summoner has access to the largest variety of elemental attacks in the game. That means you can make all of your enemies weak to a specific element, like ice, and immediately dish out a high-damage ice attack that hits all enemies, dealing big damage and letting you take more turns. \u003cstrong\u003eAn important part of this comp is making sure you have the correct Vessels and Masks to take advantage of this. \u003c/strong\u003eMake sure to craft these items in Akademia whenever you have the materials.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eGunner with Gunner, Faker, or Summoner\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePierce physical damage is the least common of the three physical attack types, so whenever you have to deal with a dungeon featuring a large number of monsters with a weakness to Pierce, the Gunner is your best fit. If you have another Gunner, a Faker, or a Summoner present, you can use the Synthesis ability Wild Barrage, which hits all enemies with Pierce damage multiple times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBerserker with Knight\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe Berserker can access two Strike damage synthesis abilities that deal massive damage, as long as a Knight is present. These two abilities, Wanton Destruction and Battlecry Tackle, have one Archetype overlap, which is the Knight. Wanton Destruction, in particular, is great, because it deals extreme physical Strike damage and it inflicts a one-time weakness to Strike. After the first use, you can continually use it every turn without losing any turn icons thanks to the weakness, making it great for tough enemies with a large amount of health.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTrickster\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe Trickster, the advanced version of the Faker, has access to an extreme physical Almighty attack that doesn\u0026#39;t consume MP. Almighty damage is a special kind of damage that enemies cannot have resistance to, but they also can\u0026#39;t be weak to. This makes it useful for enemies without weaknesses, and this special move also doesn\u0026#39;t use MP, making it great for conserving MP in a long dungeon. To use this synthesis ability you need to have two allies in with the correct Archetypes. The first ally needs to be a Knight, Healer, or Commander, with the second ally using Thief, Faker, or Merchant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBrawler, Merchant, Healer\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe Brawler, Merchant, and Healer combination gives you access to a couple of powerful Almighty attacks from the Merchant and several light attacks, as well. The Almighty attacks from the Merchant do cost money to use, but this means that they don\u0026#39;t cost MP, a trade-off you might be willing to make late into Metaphor: ReFantazio. The powerful light attacks are great to have, since your options for high damage light attacks are fairly limited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhatever the information says\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor the majority of main and side dungeons in Metaphor: ReFantazio, you can purchase information about the monsters in each dungeon from an informant. This information usually tells you what the enemies\u0026#39; weaknesses are, but if you go to your requests list, it will also add a recommended Archetypes section to the description. These are always the best possible setups, especially since it usually only recommends a couple Archetypes and not a full party of four, but you will have access to most of the enemy weaknesses, making it a nice play to start if you aren\u0026#39;t sure what party setup to go with.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n                        \n    \n        \n        \n  \n                                  \u003c/div\u003e\n\n          \n        \n        \n  \n                    \n  \n    \n          \n            \n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?
