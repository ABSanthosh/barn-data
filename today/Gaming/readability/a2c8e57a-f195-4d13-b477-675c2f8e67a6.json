  "text": "Memorial Day weekend is still more than half a work week away, but the most of the sales have already arrived at some of the biggest online retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Costco, Home Depot, and Walmart. While prices may not be quite as good as Prime Day or the Black Friday season, these discounts are still a great opportunity to save money. To help you sort through what's live and what isn't, I've put together a quick list of all of the biggest Memorial Day sales already happening ahead of the weekend. I'll be updating this page with all of the new sales as they go live ahead of the weekend.The Best Memorial Day Sales Live NowI've been covering and shopping Memorial Day sales for years and, honestly, I'm not that impressed with a lot of the discounts we've seen so far from these retailers. That being said, it is still fairly early in the week and I expect to see prices drop a bit more before the weekend. Memorial Day isn't until May 26 this year, and many smaller retailers will likely launch their sales closer to the actual holiday weekend.Should you shop Memorial Day sales or wait for better discounts?The biggest question around Memorial Day sales in general is whether you should shop now or wait for better deals later in the year. In the past, we could usually count on upcoming sales events like Prime Day and Black Friday to have the lowest prices of the year on just about everything. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of confusion around tariffs and price increases in 2025 and it seems almost certain that baseline prices on many goods in the U.S. are probably going to go up before the end of the year.If you're hoping to save as much money as possible in 2025, Memorial Day sales are definitely worth considering. Tariffs on most Chinese imports are likely to affect prices later in the year, so if you find a really good price on something you need right now, don't hesitate to pick it up before the price can go up.What Should You Buy During Memorial Day Sales?While there are certainly exceptions, I have generally found that the best Memorial Day sales tend to be for the same few categories every year. Unlike bigger shopping events like Black Friday, discounts tend to be more focused around home goods, consumer electronics, and clothing. Here's a quick breakdown of what is absolutely worth buying during Memorial Day weekend.Top Deals TodayAfter combing through all of the Memorial Day promotions that are already live, I've found that the Amazon sale has the best overall discounts. This includes things like a Star Wars LEGO set deal and discounted iPads that are at their best prices of the year. Below I've curated some of the top deals from that sale into a neat little catalog for you to browse.FurniturePerhaps the overall best thing to buy during Memorial Day sales is furniture. Unless you're getting a really cheap nightstand from Ikea, furniture is generally expensive. Memorial Day deals are an excellent time to save a ton of money on pretty much every type of furniture, including desks, gaming chairs, and outdoor patio options. While you can find these deals at most major retailers like Amazon, Target, and Walmart, I'd recommend starting with the Wayfair Memorial Day sale. Though if you're on the hunt for a gaming chair specifically, the Secretlab sale and AndaSeat sales are the way to go. There are also some pretty good discounts at FlexiSpot on various types of office furniture, including popular standing desks.Major AppliancesPurchasing a major appliance for your home is going to be expensive no matter when you do it, but Memorial Day sales can help mitigate that cost a fraction. Major appliances like refrigerators, washing machines, and ovens are all on sale right now across quite a number of retailers. You can find these deals at Costco, Best Buy, Home Depot, and Lowes currently. Some of the sales are straight discounts while others are a buy one, get one free situation. Below are the sales I'd recommend shopping if you're on the hunt for new appliances. Best Buy is a great option for most brands, but you can also get a free refrigerator from LG direct if you're only looking for the best fridge deal.TVsThere are actually a lot of good times to buy a new TV throughout the year, but Memorial Day weekend is consistently one of the best times to find discounts on newer TVs. This likely has something to do with the TV release cycle as we are now about halfway through the year and the latest TVs have finally started to drop in price. If you're looking to buy a great new television for a good price, I'd recommend picking up the LG C4 that just dropped to its lowest price ever. However, there are already plenty of other TV deals to choose from.MattressesAlthough mattresses technically count as furniture, I've broken them out into their own category because of the sheer number of Memorial Day mattress sales. Memorial Day weekend is far and away one of the best times to buy a mattress every year – you likely won't find lower prices even on Black Friday. Most major retailers have mattress promotions right now and you can find deals at Amazon, Walmart, and even Costco. However, I'd recommend shopping direct from the manufacturer to save the most money. The DreamCloud mattress sale will get you up to 60% off a new mattress right now.ClothingHoliday weekends are almost always a good time to find discounts on clothes. This is largely thanks to their proximity to a change in seasons. In the case of a Memorial Day weekend, you should be able to find some of the best prices of the year on both summer and winter clothes. Winter clothes are most likely to be part of clearance sales during this time and you should be able to find good deals on things like jackets, sweaters, and other outdoor gear. Meanwhile, every major retailer will have a sale on some sort of summer-related clothing as we head into warmer weather. I'd personally recommend checking out the REI Anniversary sale happening right now as it is its biggest sale of the year. There's also an adidas sale that is pretty good if you're looking for some athleisure deals.Laptops and PCsIf you're looking to buy a new laptop or PC this year, I'd recommend making a purchase sooner rather than later. This is especially true if you're trying to find the best time to buy a gaming PC this year, because GPU prices are already on the rise. The best Memorial Day sales tend to be directly from the manufacturers, so that's usually where you'll want to look. Dell, HP, and Lenovo all have at least part of their Memorial Day sales live right now. You can also check out Best Buy and Amazon if you're looking for brands like Acer and LG at a discount, however.KitchenwareMany of the same stores that have furniture sales are likely to have discounts on kitchenware as well during Memorial Day weekend. There is a clear crossover between furniture and the kitchen, which means now is a good time to find discounts on things like dining tables and small appliances all at once. Major online retailers like Amazon and Target have discounts on these types of things, but if you're looking for only kitchenware deals, I'd suggest taking a look at the Williams Sonoma sale. It is a lot of higher-end stuff, so discounts like these are worth checking out whenever they come around.Williams Sonoma Memorial Day SaleGrillsIf you're hoping to pick up a new barbecue before the summer season, Memorial Day sales are arguably the best time to do so. Pretty much every major retailer that has outdoor furniture on sale is going to have grills discounted right now as well. Amazon, Walmart, Costco, Home Depot, and Lowes all of discounts on popular grill brands ahead of the weekend. I'm personally planning on shopping the Home Depot sale to get a new grill this year, so that's my suggestion for anyone else. If you happen to miss this sale, you can also find deals just as good or better near the end of the summer during Labor Day sales.Video GamesMemorial Day sales aren't exactly the very best time to buy video games, but that doesn't stop there from being Memorial Day video game deals. Most of the discounts are from across a variety of retailers, but Amazon and Woot have the most prominent price cuts right now. Some of the most popular video games of the last year are on sale right now, including Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 and Kingdom Come Deliverance II. GameStop is also having a surprisingly good sale with popular games as low as $15 right now.When Do Memorial Day Sales End?Quite a few Memorial Day sales still haven't gone live yet, so there is still plenty of time to shop before the deals are gone. Most Memorial Day sales will be ending at the end of actual Memorial Day – which is Monday, May 26 this year.Jacob Kienlen is a Senior SEO Strategist and Writer for IGN.
