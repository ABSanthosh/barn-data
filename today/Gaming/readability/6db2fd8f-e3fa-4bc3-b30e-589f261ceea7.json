MechWarriors, the time for waiting is over. We’re thrilled to tell you that our first MechWarrior 5: Clans DLC, Ghost Bear: Flash Storm, is launching later today for Xbox Series X|S and Windows PC as an Xbox Play Anywhere title. You’ll be able to experience the continuation of the Operation Revival story from the perspective of one of BattleTech’s most storied Clans. The Ghost Bear is currently at a historic low point after a catastrophic start to the invasion. But a new set of Bear Khans have a daring plan to get the Ghost Bears back in the game. We launched MechWarrior 5: Clans last October for Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC, and day one with Game Pass, and we’re extremely proud of what our team at Piranha Games accomplished. In retrospect, our goal was pretty wild: delivering a game that provides a jumping-on point for new players while simultaneously honoring decades of complex, interfactional lore. All the while, we needed to ensure that players felt like they were in the cockpit of a towering ‘Mech. The Clans campaign followed the Smoke Jaguar Clan, a faction whose aggression and obsession with leading the Children of Kerensky out of exile made them notorious among rival Clans — the Ghost Bears are a completely different beast. Where the Smoke Jaguars were obsessed over what they saw as their manifest destiny, the Ghost Bears know the power of patience; its “ambush predator” mantra perfectly attuned to the Strana Mechty Ghost Bear, whom the Clan took as their namesake. That approach hasn’t served them well as of late, however. Clan Ghost Bear has fallen far behind their fellow Clans during the opening events of the Clan Invasion due to poor preparation and leadership. But newly elected Khans (Clan leaders) Bjorn Jorgensson and Aletha Kabrinski look to put that past behind them and take their rightful place among the other invading Clans. You can see how it begins with an exclusive look at MechWarrior 5: Clans – Ghost Bear: Flash Storm’s opening cinematic below. Where the Jaguar campaign of the base game did a fair bit of table setting to immerse you in the world of MW5: Clans and the invasion of the Inner Sphere, The Ghost Bear campaign will jump you right into the action with a story that picks up after the death of ilKhan Leo Showers and the election of his successor, Ulric Kerensky. Much like the base campaign, the story of the Ghost Bears will be told not just through the missions you play, but through over 30 minutes of all-new cinematics highlighting a new cast of Ghost Bear warriors, bringing their personalities and motivations to the forefront – all while expanding the MechWarrior 5 universe and ensuring it’s an enjoyable experience for all players new and old. Clan Ghost Bear was the focus of MechWarrior 2’s first expansion pack, Ghost Bear’s Legacy, which was launched 30 years ago. It has been a fan-favorite ever since, and we count ourselves among those ranks. Ghost Bear: Flash Storm not only allowed us to revisit the Ghost Bears, but it also lets us explore a narrative that’s fundamentally different from the base game’s experience as we join the Silveroot Keshik and fight to forge Clan Ghost Bear’s true place in the Inner Sphere. But to recover from such a disastrous start won’t come easily. To ensure that the Bears do not repeat their mistakes, the new Bear Khans have instituted heavy rationing of their supplies. That means that you’re going to have to be scrappy. You won’t have access to vast stockpiles of ‘Mechs like Clan Smoke Jaguar, and you’ll also have to work within a smaller resource budget. Despite the rationing, you will have four new BattleMechs and four new OmniMechs, added to your available roster, from heavy ‘Mechs like the Night Gyr to the nimble Firefly scout. Those new ‘Mechs will also be retroactively available in the Smoke Jaguar campaign when you purchase the Ghost Bear: Flash Storm DLC. And you’ll also be able to command the Elemental foot soldiers, which can provide valuable human scale boots-on-the-ground support to your five-player squad – just watch your step. At Piranha Games, we pair our DLC launches with major updates to the base game. Ghost Bear: Flash Storm is certainly no exception. We’ve overhauled the UI to make customization more intuitive, such as simplifying custom presets that can quickly be restored, and adding a context menu to make the ‘Mech lab easier to navigate. We’ve also enhanced controller support with a new config that MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries players will love.. We’re excited to hear what you think about Ghost Bear: Flash Storm. The base game is available on Game Pass and the DLC is priced at $19.99 on the Xbox Store, and we encourage you to check it out – whether you’re a long-time fan of the MechWarrior series or want to experience fast-paced ‘Mech battles for the first time. It’s a great time to get into the action, and we hope to see you soon! MechWarrior 5: Clans – Ghost Bear: Flash Storm Leo Showers is dead. As Ulric Kerensky changes the rules of engagement, Clan Ghost Bear khans Bjorn Jorgenson and Aletha Kabrinski plot their next moves as they strive to take the lead in the race towards Terra. Take command of the Silveroot Keshik, an elite unit tasked with proving Ghost Bear’s strength and reclaiming lost glory.  Engage in a Trial of Possession to claim the powerful Ebon Jaguar and Night Gyr ‘Mechs. Face off against the legendary Second Sword of Light in a battle for control of Alshain, a world replete with ‘Mech factories and orbital shipyards capable of producing warships.  Unleash 4 new OmniMechs and 4 new BattleMechs, and command Elementals as you take the fight to space and beyond in this thrilling expansion!  Piranha Games Inc. $49.99 $39.99 PC Game Pass Xbox Game Pass In MECHWARRIOR 5: CLANS, players take on the role of a newly graduated pilot from the Smoke Jaguar cadet program, thrust into the heart of the Clan Invasion of the Inner Sphere during Operation Revival. This pivotal moment in the MechWarrior universe sees players leading a five-mech \"Star\" squad across numerous planets with diverse biomes, engaging in an expansive campaign filled with immersive gameplay and intricate combat encounters. Armed with customizable BattleMechs featuring cutting-edge technologies, players explore a wealth of tactical options and strategic possibilities. The game leverages the power of the Unreal Engine to deliver stunning environmental details and visceral destruction, making every battle against the tyrants of the Inner Sphere an epic experience.
