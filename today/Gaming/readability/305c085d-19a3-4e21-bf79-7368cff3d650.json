The open world will be released in stages, and will eventually cover 1600 square kilometers. New features and content will be added as the map expands. Kunos explains the map is fully laser-scanned, and will boast \"unmatched detail.\"Local businesses based around the Nürburgring are also set to feature, so players will be able to rent cars and upgrade and customise their vehicles at actual outets. As part of today's news, Kunos has opened an invitation to all local businesses in the vicinity of the Nürburgring to contact the studio for the opportunity to be featured in Assetto Corsa EVO.Assetto Corsa EVO will initially become available on PC in Early Access from January 16, 2025. Console versions are also expected eventually, but not until the game exits its Early Access period.Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.
