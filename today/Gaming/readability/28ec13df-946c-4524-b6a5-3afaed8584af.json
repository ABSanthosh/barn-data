  "text": "The holiday season is upon us, and the ID@Xbox team is thrilled to showcase this month’s picks for Indie Selects. But first, we want to extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone for supporting independent games on Xbox over the past year.  Indie Selects is our special platform to celebrate the incredibly weird and unique. Someone’s perfect game isn’t necessarily a massive blockbuster IP, but may be a polished and emotionally resonant story, a brand new spin on an existing idea, or just something truly unusual. Thank you for checking out our recommendations and supporting amazing game creators on our platform. Secondly, instead of giving you a one-week December Selects collection, we decided to build out 3 weeks’ worth of 2024 Indie Select Highlights.  Each week, starting December 11, we’ll be highlighting and promoting 18 of our favorite titles that launched this last year.  Be sure to check out the Indie Selects section in the Xbox Store (head to the Games Home tab and a few rows down) every Wednesday for more must-have indies. Finally, on January 28, 2025, we will celebrate the one-year anniversary of this program with a 2024 Anniversary Collection. Our team will pick six top Indie Selects from the previous year that we believe are absolute must-haves and place them in this prestigious shrine for all to witness. We have more surprises, new sales, and new collections planned for 2025, but for now, let’s focus on the present. This month is stuffed.  There were so many titles to choose from that truly pushed the envelope in terms of unique design, mysterious mechanics, dramatic storytelling, and the art of fun.  We all made some strong cases for what we wanted to champion.  Some of us were still in our October bag and needed something terrifying to get the heart pumping.  A lot of us, understandably, wanted to build a bond with a giant wolf that we could ride on to our next adventure.  Several of us wanted to get lost in something: a mysterious world, impossible choices, or maybe just our own creativity.  We ended up with a list that thankfully kept everyone happy here and we’re sure that there’s something here that you won’t soon forget. Here’s what we’ve got for you this month (in no particular order): Neva I don’t know if any of you are looking for more reasons to get emotional, but Neva will hit you right in the feels. I played through last weekend and found myself in awe of its beautiful presentation, visual splendor, and haunting soundtrack. I was also reduced to tears on occasion. It’s an incredibly moving piece of software that also happens to be quite fun and compelling to play. This follow-up to the gorgeous and emotionally charged Gris from Nomada Studio shows a studio honing in on their craft. Gris was an impactful work of art; Neva takes that core formula and adds satisfying yet simple platforming and combat to the mix. The game is only about 5 hours from start to finish but those hours will make you reflect inwardly and touch your heart in ways that are rare for games. If the combat scenarios get a bit tricky for you, the game offers a “Story Mode” difficulty that removes the health bar entirely and allows you to play without the fear of dying. Neva Neva is an emotionally-charged action adventure from the visionary team behind the critically acclaimed GRIS. Neva chronicles the story of Alba, a young woman bound to a curious wolf cub following a traumatic encounter with dark forces. Together they embark on a perilous journey through a once-beautiful world as it slowly decays around them. Over time, their relationship will evolve as they learn to work together, helping one another to brave increasingly dangerous situations. The wolf will grow from a rebellious cub to an imposing adult seeking to forge his own identity, testing Alba’s love and their commitment to one another. As the cursed world threatens to overwhelm them, Alba and her courageous companion will do whatever it takes to survive and make a new home, together. Animal Well Animal Well is an illusive, beautiful, 2D pixel art Metroidvania full of abstract puzzles in haunting, living environments.  You play as a squishy little blob in a dark and wet world that offers up its own interpretive language on how to proceed beyond to the next area.  As you progress through new areas, you’ll gain access to more routes as you find mysterious tools and understand their mechanics. The creatures populating the well create an interesting dynamic as you discover their purpose.  Some animals are essential to solving complex problems and because there’s no real combat, other animals often must be cleverly avoided which in-and-of-itself can be its own puzzle.  Even as you traverse area after area, the game is packed with so much to do and so many more secrets to find – well after the “ending”.  This is one of those special games that leaves an imprint. It took me some time to nail down what exactly it was that gave me goosebumps during each minute of my playthrough.  Finally, it hit me.  Your tiny, bright little blob, though very alive and cute, isn’t really the main character: The environment is! There are so many small moments and interactions with the environment that are so wonderfully satisfying, and they just keep happening one after the other. Delving into the deepest mysteries of the environment felt like I was asking the developer directly, “What were you trying to do here?” At some point, my goals for what I wanted to get out of the game shifted as I uncovered more and more secrets and felt rewarded for examining every pixel shift.  If you relish finding everything in a game without looking for help online, prepare to put your skills to the test and enjoy the ride. ANIMAL WELL Hatch from your flower and spelunk through the beautiful and sometimes haunting world of Animal Well, a pixelated wonder rendered in intricate audio and visual detail. Encounter lively creatures small and large, helpful and ominous as you discover unconventional upgrades and unravel the well’s secrets. This is a truly unique experience that can make you laugh in fear, surprise, or delight. Planet Coaster 2 Planet Coaster 2 is gratifying for anyone who loves theme park and strategy simulations. As someone who loves both strategy and creativity, this game hits me in all the right ways. From the beginning, you enter a very vibrant world with spectacular visuals. The in-game characters are great at guiding you through the UI, tasks, and management of the park.

Each type of ghost creates specific supernatural phenomena that you need to identify and to puzzle out in your journal. If you get the correct ghost type, you win. The secret sauce is in the experience you have while searching for the clues. The game masterfully uses classical horror cues like sound or light to create the feeling of a haunted house, reacting to your actions and making you always fear for your life. As you cannot really fight back, your only option is to get things done as quickly as possible while avoiding the danger. Finally, the game is a great one to play with a few friends. Nothing beats hearing your friends screaming in your voice chat that they are about to die and the silence afterwards. That’s both the funniest part of the game – as well as the scariest.

Fear the Spotlight Fear the Spotlight is a retro, ’90s-inspired horror game focused on puzzle solving, gripping story, and avoiding detection. Vivian and Amy sneak into their school at night for a séance which, of course, goes horribly wrong and Amy disappears.  Now Vivian must search the school for her friend and uncover the mystery of the school’s past.  During the search you’ll be stalked by a monster – more specifically, a man with a spotlight for a head.  There’s no combat, so you’ll need to avoid detection at all costs while you explore and solve puzzles which allow you acquire key items to progress further.  This isn’t the type of horror game that is full of heart-pounding jump scares, but a slow build of creeping, uneasy, tension that adds to a great narrative experience. Fear the Spotlight Fear the Spotlight is an atmospheric third-person horror adventure with a disturbing mystery to unravel. Sneak into school after hours with Vivian and Amy, survive a séance gone wrong, solve tactile puzzles, and, whatever you do, stay out of the spotlight… Sunnyside High has a dark history. When Vivian enters the deserted corridors for a seance with the rebellious Amy, she suddenly ends up alone, and at the mercy of the monster who wanders the halls. Vivian must avoid its gaze, find her friend, and uncover the disturbing, murderous truth of a decades old tragedy. Fear the Spotlight is a creepy love letter to classic 90s horror experiences with a focus of rich storytelling, puzzle solving, and a tense atmosphere. This is a perfect narrative horror game for those new to the genre. ESCAPE THE NIGHTMARE The séance went terribly wrong. Amy has disappeared, and the school has transformed into a nightmarish version of its former self.

Slay the Princess – The Pristine Cut This is a love story. Right? Slay the Princess is a visual novel… but more like a choose your own adventure with the goal to slay the princess. But why? That’s what you need to find out by exploring several dozen prompts from the voice of a “narrator”, who sheds more light on the situation. The genius here is that your approach will determine your path, invite more voices to join the narrator, and alter the perception of each situation. As your behavior becomes more defined, the princess’s physical form will manifest accordingly. This all culminates in the ending of one story and the beginning of another – again and again – as you progress through the hidden story beneath it all. The black and white pencil art is fantastic, the musical score is intense, and the voice acting is top of its class.  It’s dark, creepy, charming and incredibly intriguing. Oh, and you’ll die a lot. Don’t worry about that. Just keep going. It’s worth it. Slay the Princess – The Pristine Cut You're on a path in the woods, and at the end of that path is a cabin. And in the basement of that cabin is a Princess. You're here to slay her. If you don't, it will be the end of the world. She will do everything in her power to stop you. She'll charm, and she'll lie, and she'll promise you the world, and if you let her, she'll kill you a dozen times over. You can't let that happen. You do care about the fate of the world, right? Slay the Princess – The Pristine Cut is a fully voice-acted horror tragicomedy featuring the impeccable talents of Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight, with lovingly hand-penciled frames by Ignatz-winning graphic novelist Abby Howard. This game features a princess. She's very bad and you have to get rid of her for all our sakes. She's just an ordinary human Princess, and you can definitely slay her as long as you put your mind to it. Hopefully you won't die. But if you do, you'll die a lot. Be careful and stay focused on the task at hand! What you say and what you believe will shift the story in dramatic ways. Ah, but what’s in the Pristine Cut? Are you sure you want to find out? If you do, you’re likely to discover things that are best left experienced directly. Seriously, turn back. … Oh, you’re still reading? Very well, I shall tell you. The Pristine Cut contains, precisely: – 3 brand new chapters replete with mysteries—and consequences. – Never before seen Princesses who will all murder you without a second thought. – Expansions to familiar routes: The Den, The Apotheosis and The Fury each have more than doubled in length. – Over 35% more content overall—and all of it filled with great opportunities to listen to me and do your job. – A new ending. And hopefully one that saves the world rather than damns it. – Gallery to Track Your Progress: Cherish your memories, relive your exploits, and uncover deeply hidden secrets with the new gallery feature. – Over 1,200 New Hand-Penciled Frames hand-illustrated by Abby Howard. – Over 2,500 New Lines of Dialogue fully voiced dialogue by the impeccable Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight. Yes, prepare yourself for an expanded journey filled with new perils, difficult choices, and unforgettable encounters. Will you stay on the path to slay the Princess, or will the new chapters alter your fate? (That said, while I wish free-will weren’t a thing here, I cannot emphasize this enough: you have to slay her. Please.)",

Right? \u003cem\u003eSlay the Princess\u003c/em\u003e is a visual novel… but more like a choose your own adventure with the goal to slay the princess. But why? That’s what you need to find out by exploring several dozen prompts from the voice of a “narrator”, who sheds more light on the situation. The genius here is that your approach will determine your path, invite more voices to join the narrator, and alter the perception of each situation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs your behavior becomes more defined, the princess’s physical form will manifest accordingly. This all culminates in the ending of one story and the beginning of another – again and again – as you progress through the hidden story beneath it all. The black and white pencil art is fantastic, the musical score is intense, and the voice acting is top of its class.  It’s dark, creepy, charming and incredibly intriguing. Oh, and you’ll die a lot. Don’t worry about that. Just keep going. It’s worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv data-product-id=\"9pg84ggvtsqv\" id=\"msp1732540320454\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/9pg84ggvtsqv\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8558.14185363995673665.e4423642-7c90-4589-9ff6-35798a86cf8a.dbc97c33-b56f-4484-a627-1542dae9ba2e?w=400\u0026amp;h=600\" alt=\"Slay the Princess - The Pristine Cut\"/\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003ch2\u003eSlay the Princess – The Pristine Cut\u003c/h2\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\n\t\tYou\u0026#39;re on a path in the woods, and at the end of that path is a cabin. And in the basement of that cabin is a Princess.\n\nYou\u0026#39;re here to slay her. If you don\u0026#39;t, it will be the end of the world.\n\nShe will do everything in her power to stop you. She\u0026#39;ll charm, and she\u0026#39;ll lie, and she\u0026#39;ll promise you the world, and if you let her, she\u0026#39;ll kill you a dozen times over. You can\u0026#39;t let that happen.\n\nYou do care about the fate of the world, right?\n\nSlay the Princess – The Pristine Cut is a fully voice-acted horror tragicomedy featuring the impeccable talents of Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight, with lovingly hand-penciled frames by Ignatz-winning graphic novelist Abby Howard.\n\nThis game features a princess. She\u0026#39;s very bad and you have to get rid of her for all our sakes. She\u0026#39;s just an ordinary human Princess, and you can definitely slay her as long as you put your mind to it. Hopefully you won\u0026#39;t die. But if you do, you\u0026#39;ll die a lot. Be careful and stay focused on the task at hand! What you say and what you believe will shift the story in dramatic ways.\n\nAh, but what’s in the Pristine Cut? Are you sure you want to find out? If you do, you’re likely to discover things that are best left experienced directly. Seriously, turn back. \n\n…\n\nOh, you’re still reading? Very well, I shall tell you. The Pristine Cut contains, precisely:\n\n– 3 brand new chapters replete with mysteries—and consequences.\n– Never before seen Princesses who will all murder you without a second thought.\n– Expansions to familiar routes: The Den, The Apotheosis and The Fury each have more than doubled in length.\n– Over 35% more content overall—and all of it filled with great opportunities to listen to me and do your job.\n– A new ending. And hopefully one that saves the world rather than damns it. \n– Gallery to Track Your Progress: Cherish your memories, relive your exploits, and uncover deeply hidden secrets with the new gallery feature.\n– Over 1,200 New Hand-Penciled Frames hand-illustrated by Abby Howard.\n– Over 2,500 New Lines of Dialogue fully voiced dialogue by the impeccable Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight.\n\nYes, prepare yourself for an expanded journey filled with new perils, difficult choices, and unforgettable encounters. Will you stay on the path to slay the Princess, or will the new chapters alter your fate? (That said, while I wish free-will weren’t a thing here, I cannot emphasize this enough: you have to slay her. Please.)\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
