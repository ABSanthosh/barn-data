  "text": "After some fierce battles to get siege Fortizars anchored on grid with the two Keepstars, PanFam has chosen to stand down when it comes to their destruction.  The two Keepstars are not dead yet, not as of this writing.  But it appears that their fate has been all but sealed at this point. The cycle of structure defense in null sec had previously settled down to the “real” fight being over the armor time.  It is tough to defend the shield layer, since that can be attacked at any time, and the hull timer is a hazard because, if you lose, you are stuck there in space where your structure used to be and a mass of hostiles who were sufficient to overwhelm your defense.  So the armor timer is where the final, last stand defense has tended to happen. Until now.  Now it appears that the fights are going to happen over the siege Fortizars as they are anchored… and maybe not even those.  We had the big fight over the two Fortizars that were anchored in HB-1NJ. My first view of the Fort after jumping into the fight But the next day the Fortizar in EFM-C4 started its final cycle and PanFam did not show up to contest the structure. The Fort in EFM-C4 When it came time for the armor timer on the Keepstar, the few Horde in system sat on tether while the structure itself took shots at the attacking fleets. Keepstar being hit with almost no response The response was so quiet that Asher Elias jumped into the system, deployed a CRAB beacon, and did some ratting in a lancer dread on the contested grid just to tempt somebody to show up.  One Hordling appeared to take the bait, but otherwise Asher was pretty well protected. Of course, the lancer dread he chose to fly was the Gallente model, the Hubris. Asher’s Hubris is visible Later, at the Great Wildlands Keepstar in HB-1NJ the story was the same.  A fleet went out, shot the structure and set things up for the kill three days hence. The HB-1 Keepstar now in hull timer We did get a bit of a stir out of them when we went through the regional gate… both the Raven and Flycatcher fleets… and into G-OTSD, their staging system, where we proceeded to shoot their Ansiblex jump bridge, reinforcing it, then started shooting their Keepstar until they put a call out to form dreadnoughts. Hitting the Ansiblex When the dreads started to undock we went back through the gate and waited on the other side to see who might come through.  As it happened, I had to drop off for a while at that point, so I docked up in the Fortizar and went off to have dinner.  It looked like we went back through the gate at some point and snagged one of the dreads that got off on its own.  Reports were that while there were plenty of hostiles in the system, nobody went to save him. Later I was able to log back in and fly home on my own.  Whatever camps there had been on the route earlier had packed up and gone home.   I was docked up and safe. Gobbins, the leader of Pandemic Horde, the central member of PanFam, had earlier appeared to concede Imperium dominance in a Discord message to his pilots, which was captured and posted to Reddit shortly thereafter.  He called the Imperium the biggest EUTZ blob, an appellation somewhat rich from somebody who helped rally two thirds of null sec to attack the Imperium back in World War Bee. The Gobbins statement So far he seems disinclined to call on Winter Coalition to come support them… though Winter Coalition seemed keen to poke PanFam themselves on a Friday night. And maybe he is keeping his powder dry for now, waiting until we go through the gate into Etherium Reach before he draws a line to defend.  His pilots have been pronouncing in local that Insmother doesn’t matter, that their staging systems, G-QTSD and MJ-5F9, are the actual important systems… though G-Q is just on the other side of the gate from EFM-C4, so it feels like they could have showed up without much effort. It certainly wasn’t much effort for us to go through the gate while covering some entosis work in Insmother and smash that Ansiblex. Meanwhile, we have some time to wait before the hull timers for both Keepstars count down. The EFM-C4 Keepstar as it started its 3 day count down I expect that the final timers will also be uncontested on Monday.  There has been an off and on camp on the gate between EFM-C4 and G-QTSD to keep people from evacuating ships and supplies from the Keepstar back to their staging. (They got somebody!)  What will happen when we go through that gate for real remains to be seen. Addendum: I was reminded after I wrote this that our war objective is the conquest of Insmother, so talk of going into Etherium Reach is just me and not an official statement of the Imperium.",
