  "description": "It's fitting that the new trailer for The Last of Us Season 2 begins with Joel and Ellie at a physical distance, because there's an emotional gulf between them by the final scene shown. The upcoming season starts five years after Season 1, and Ellie doesn't know what Joel did to save her yet. Once she finds out, things are never going to be the same between them.The latest trailer is light on context if you've never played The Last of Us Part II. But Joel and Ellie found some relative peace in the intervening years. That's coming to an end because their sanctuary isn't as safe as they believed, as both the infected and outside forces are in play. That includes the newly introduced Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), who will play a major role this season. The trailer also features an early look at Joe Pantoliano as Eugene, a character who was only hinted at in the game. The Last of Us Season 2 panel is currently underway at SXSW, and it's being live-streamed on YouTube. Series stars Pedro Pascal, Bella Ramsey, and Gabriel Luna are on hand with Season 2 newcomers Young Mazino, Isabela Merced, and Kaitlyn Dever. Showrunners and series co-creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann also joined the panel as they unveiled the new trailer for Season 2. You can watch the panel below.Continue Reading at GameSpot",
