  "text": "Slender: The Arrival VR by developer Blue Isle Studios is the unholy union of a horror phenomenon and an innovative gaming peripheral. Together, they deliver a holistic horror experience to players looking for a game that can shake them to their core.  On May 13, Slender: The Arrival VR will utilize the platform-defining features and capabilities of PS VR2 to summon the horror icon in its most terrifying incarnation yet — and I’m excited to share what makes this upcoming release the best way to experience our title! Immersed in virtual terror It’s been over a decade since the release of the original Slender: The Arrival, and the 10th Anniversary Update significantly enhanced the graphics and elevated the overall gameplay experience. Every shadow, every model, and every hair-raising encounter with the mysterious Slender Man was rendered in stunning detail using the latest Unreal Engine 5 technologies. Slender: The Arrival VR remains true to the original game while adapting elements to the full-scale immersion VR. The PS VR2 is a groundbreaking peripheral, and it allowed us to enhance the strengths of Slender: The Arrival further. Atmospheric, gameplay, and audiovisual stimulation combine to transport the player to another dimension. A key part of the Slender: The Arrival VR experience is the feedback received when The Slender Man is in your area. The detailed haptic feedback in the PSVR2 Sense controllers won’t be the only way you feel Slender Man’s presence, as the PS VR2 headset vibration feedback makes it seem like he dwells within the player’s own mind. Oh, and the vibration function isn’t reserved for Slenderman. There are other enemies to fear in Slender: The Arrival VR. With all these new additions and more, The Slender Man’s presence is more eerie and intimidating than ever before. Knowing that he is nearby is scary enough in flatscreen, but in VR, he can appear anywhere in your field of vision. Sound queues are also more realistic and immediate, adding to the immersion and tangible sense of gnawing dread. A Slender reimagining Slender: The Arrival VR features all of the new additions included in the 10th Anniversary update, from the enhanced visuals to the brand-new storyline and characters. The team has also implemented a range of VR accessibility options so that all players who want to step into the world of Slender: The Arrival VR can do so comfortably. There’s a bespoke interactive menu for VR and multiple comfort settings, including standing/seating modes, snap and continuous movement, and sensitivity sliders. The Slender Man is a paranormal icon that has long terrified the curious-minded worldwide. It stands tall (really tall, actually) alongside long-established horror mainstays. Similarly, the original Slender: The Arrival remains the official, proven, and definitive adaptation of The Slender Man to the gaming world.  By expanding and deepening its gameplay with the PS VR2 headset, we’ve provided players with a unique and engaging experience that creates a more intimate connection with the world they explore — something arguably most important… and frightening… in the survival-horror genre that they will get to experience on May 13.
