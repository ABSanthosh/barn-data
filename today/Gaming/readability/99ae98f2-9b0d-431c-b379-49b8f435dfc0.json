  "text": "Image credit: Sam C There isn't a huge list of things that'll immediately sell me on your game, but there is one that'll draw me in without fail pretty much every single time: you can drive around in a kei truck. Now, admittedly, there are very few games where you can actually do this, the delightful Promise Mascot Agency being the most recent one. There's the yet to be released Honcho from the devs behind Landlord's Super and Jalopy, you can bet your bottom dollar I'll be playing that one. And now, there's Easy Delivery Co., a game with a kei truck that isn't exactly what it says on the tin. In Easy Delivery Co., you are an Animal Crossing by way of PS1 game-esque cat character, who drives around a kei truck in a snowy mountainside town delivering different things. That indie PS1 aesthetic can obviously feel a bit overdone in some cases now, but Easy Delivery Co. just looks right, a bit dreary, a bit lonely even, yet with a hint of goofiness about it. Good stuff! Easy Delivery Co. | Official Reveal Trailer Watch on YouTube The game's Steam page notes that there's \"definitely no secrets\", which between you and me I think might just be a lie. Apparently the soundtrack is made up of lo-fi, drum 'n' bass, and jungle tracks, a real late '90s, early 2000s arcade racer vibe it seems. Oh, and there's a four-player split-screen co-op racing mode too? Dang, this game was just made to be played on a CRT, something I'll be doing as soon as I'm able to. According to a press release developer Sam C is inspired by games like Animal Crossing, but also The Long Dark, a pairing of games I would never think to make in my life, except here I am craving just that. No release date in sight for Easy Delivery Co. bar \"later this year\", so in the meantime you can wishlist it on Steam here, and check out its demo too!",
