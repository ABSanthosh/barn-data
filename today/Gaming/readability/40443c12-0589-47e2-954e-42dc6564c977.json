Legion at a glance As with other expansions of the current era, this one comes with some free subscription time. Seven Day of Omega for 10 PLEX CCP just gives everybody 10 PLEX on login and you can use it to buy the seven days.  Only one purchase per account.  This offer is good until June 3rd. In addition, there is also the expected round of login rewards available. Legion login rewards The usual range of boosters you’ll probably forget about, SKINR resources you’ll probably never use, EverMarks you’ll pile up, and skill points… well, we love skill points and if you’re Omega you’ll be collecting 550K of them. Also, with your Alpha account, if you collect the seven days of Omega on June 2nd, you should be able to collect all the Omega rewards on your account.  You get the missed ones retroactively when you go Omega.  I’ll be testing this theory with my own Alpha accounts. Previously, with their Legion in Focus pre-launch post CCP gave us a list of what they felt were the most important aspects of the expansion. Freelance Jobs help corporations grow while giving new capsuleers meaningful ways to connect and contribute. Two powerful new ships enter the battlefield New sovereignty upgrades enable deeper customization Corporation palettes allow more creative control and corp branding Massive ship and module balance pass refreshes fleet combat and logistics Visual updates to ships and map bring style and function together I suspect that is not only the list of items they feel are most important, but ranked by their perceived importance to the game as well.  CCP remains as obsessed as any online subscription title with player retention, and the one path the data says makes that more likely is people joining a corporation.  Once again, I will drag out the slide from Fanfest 2014. New Player Trajectory from Fanfest 2014 They want more people to end up in that “Group / Diverse” circle because the data says those people stay longer.  And I can’t argue with that.  I’ve hung around continuously since late 2011 largely due to becoming part of the space opera that is null sec. I remain dubious that corporation mercenary missions, or freelance missions, or whatever are going to get more people to join player run corporations, mostly because I am not convinced that corporation projects as they currently exist are an key aspect of the corporation experience.  KarmaFleet tried it a few times.  People barely noticed. But my corporation experience may not be typical, so we’ll see.  As I said previously, if these freelance jobs make for even a slightly better experience in the game by adding some variety to missions and goals, it will likely be worth it. Unmentioned, thus apparently under valued, are changes to the map.  I suspect this will have more impact on new players than the freelance jobs. I support any updates that makes the in-game map more useful.  I have been complaining about it since day one and 22 years and two maps later CCP seems to have finally gotten the idea.  I’ll have to see how useful the changes are, but at least we’re getting something. Aside from that, the introduction of new ships is something many people look forward to with an expansion.  I expect the new Triglavian Marauder and the Angel Cartel Dreadnought to be immediately sought out by the wealthier pilots of New Eden and then hunted by those whose joy comes from blowing up the most expensive toys.  The two questions for any new ship are generally “How soon until somebody has one?” and “How soon until one makes for an expensive kill mail?” One interesting item not on the priority list but buried deep in the notes. Increased the resistances of Energized Membranes, Armor Coatings, Armor Hardeners, Shield Hardeners, and Shield Amplifiers by ~11%. Note: This is a full rollback of the Surgical Strike resistance nerfs. Surgical Strike was, at the time, a controversial update and I have a whole post with links out to reactions to it.  When it landed back in April 2020 it was aiming to make more ships blow up, but hit super capitals specifically to try to stem the menace of super ratting and the alleged “230 million ISK ticks” that CCP was using to justify the nerf. (I forget the exact number, but it later came out that the number happened only once and was not representative of super ratting yields.  But, you know CCP.) While that took supers out of anomalies, CCP kept going and a year later started the starvation economy (obligatory link to the Year of Disappointment post) that made capital ships too expensive to undock, causing logins to plummet. Anyway, five years later they’ve undone the last of that I guess.  Hell, they’ve gone and boosted the capabilities of supers with this patch.  It is almost as if they want us to undock again! Finally, because I am not going to go through all of the patch notes here, the booby prize for Legion features has to be the new Omega Benefits Window. Omega Benefits You can click on any of those categories and you’ll get a full page screen with two sentences vaguely describing what each benefit means.  So if you click on Vote for CSM, you see this. How is this a benefit? They all contain that much depth… and they all have an active upgrade button whether or not you are already Omega that will sell you a full price subscription. I get it, they need to make money… but this doesn’t feel very convincing.  I’m only fine with it because they clearly didn’t invest much time in it.  It feels like a feature some exec demanded (What do you mean people can’t use their credit card from within the game to buy subscription time?”) and became a checkbox item that they did just enough to get by.  I’ve had many a feature like that over the course of my career. There is a Legion highlights video available as well. So there it is.  We’ll have to figure out how it plays out as it goes.  Few things survive contact with the player base unscathed… and those that do are generally just ignored.  (Looking at you Omega Benefits!) As is usual, there is also an accompanying Twitch Drops campaign going on for the expansion.  If they aren’t subsidizing the streaming community then it isn’t any sort of big deal.

player run corporations, mostly because I am not convinced that corporation projects as they currently exist are an key aspect of the corporation experience.  KarmaFleet tried it a few times.  People barely noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut my corporation experience may not be typical, so we’ll see.  As I said previously, if these freelance jobs make for even a slightly better experience in the game by adding some variety to missions and goals, it will likely be worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnmentioned, thus apparently under valued, are changes to the map.  I suspect this will have more impact on new players than the freelance jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI support any updates that makes the in-game map more useful.  I have been complaining about it since day one and 22 years and two maps later CCP seems to have finally gotten the idea.  I’ll have to see how useful the changes are, but at least we’re getting something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from that, the introduction of new ships is something many people look forward to with an expansion.  I expect the new Triglavian Marauder and the Angel Cartel Dreadnought to be immediately sought out by the wealthier pilots of New Eden and then hunted by those whose joy comes from blowing up the most expensive toys.  The two questions for any new ship are generally “How soon until somebody has one?” and “How soon until one makes for an expensive kill mail?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne interesting item not on the priority list but buried deep in the notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIncreased the resistances of Energized Membranes, Armor Coatings, Armor Hardeners, Shield Hardeners, and Shield Amplifiers by ~11%.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ci\u003eNote: This is a full rollback of the Surgical Strike resistance nerfs.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSurgical Strike\u003c/em\u003e was, at the time, a controversial update and I have a \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2020/04/15/ccp-launches-a-surgical-strike-on-new-eden/\"\u003ewhole post with links out to reactions to it\u003c/a\u003e.  When it landed back in April 2020 it was aiming to make more ships blow up, but hit super capitals specifically to try to stem the menace of super ratting and the alleged “230 million ISK ticks” that CCP was using to justify the nerf. (I forget the exact number, but it later came out that the number happened only once and was not representative of super ratting yields.  But, you know CCP.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile that took supers out of anomalies, CCP kept going and a year later started the starvation economy (obligatory link to the \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2022/08/15/new-eden-and-the-year-of-disappointment/\"\u003eYear of Disappointment\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e post) that made capital ships too expensive to undock, causing logins to plummet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, five years later they’ve undone the last of that I guess.  Hell, they’ve gone and boosted the capabilities of supers with this patch.  It is almost as if they want us to undock again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, because I am not going to go through all of the patch notes here, the booby prize for \u003cem\u003eLegion\u003c/em\u003e features has to be the new Omega Benefits Window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_135296\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

they clearly didn’t invest much time in it.  It feels like a feature some exec demanded (What do you mean people can’t use their credit card from within the game to buy subscription time?”) and became a checkbox item that they did just enough to get by.  I’ve had many a feature like that over the course of my career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a Legion highlights video available as
