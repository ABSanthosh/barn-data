Stars Reach – Continued Testing The first item on the agenda was a delay in the launch of the Kickstarter campaign.  I wrote about that last week and took their “in a week” statement very seriously, assuming the launch would be today.  It will not be.  But they are also not under any pressure to get the campaign started if they do not feel things are ready to go.  So look for the campaign to launch some time next week. While not really part of the meeting, there were some preliminaries around the Discord server configuration.  There had been a private Discord server for people invited to the play test as well as a public server for those interested in following the game.  The private server is going to go away and everything will be done on the public server. As part of this, everybody had their team changed from a color to a Greek letter.  This was the translation table I saw. Old Team to New Team Translation Table I was assured that it wasn’t really necessary to know your team, which was good because I forgot mine almost immediately.  I only knew my old team because they made your name the color of your team, and my name was blue.  It is still blue, but everybody in Star Alpha may not be so indicated I guess.  Maybe they were running out of colors. They want to get more people into play tests and are bring people on board, but putting them on teams with some current testers as the easiest way to get new players up to speed is to have more experience players around who can answer questions. They will send out pings on the Discord server to the specific teams to announce when they are up for a play test. It also sounds like there will be more play tests with changes and updates being introduced frequently.  This means that things will be reset to starting fresh again more often.  To compensate for that the tests will be setup so that you will start with points already earned in some skill categories to try and ease the problem of having to grind those all up again… and it was in danger of feeling like a grind. Last week also saw Raph do an “Ask Me Anything” on Reddit in the r/MMORPG subreddit, which was pretty brave because you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy than that one. Some of r/MMORPG’s 2024 greatest hits He managed to get through it pretty well and you can read his answers here. One of the take aways was a sketch of a launch timeline: Alpha: early summer. Beta: Towards the end of the year. Launch: Early next year. One question that did not come up in the AMA was support for platforms besides Windows.  The plan is to launch on Windows and expand as they can afterwards, something that came up on the Saturday fireside. There a Tour of Stars Reach post put up by Raph in an attempt to explain the game in a more concise way that they pillars posts we got last summer.  Those were vision, this was a bit more concrete.  It included a view of the galaxy and what constitutes a zone. Welcome to the Galaxy There was also a dive into what there might be to do in the game, the typical game play styles one might partake in. The play session plan Me, I want to know when I get my first ship. And then, on Saturday, there was also a play test.  However, we were not yet to the play tests where you got some skill points up front and everything had been reset so it was back to square one again. As is my usual routine, my first goal was to get the grav mesh.  However, perhaps taking a cue from Spenser Johnson, I found once again that somebody had moved my grav mesh… or changed up how to make it, which took me a bit to discover. Knowing I needed the anti-grav element I went assaying for it, only to come up dry.  They I went harvesting the plant life that yielded it in a previous test, only to find myself thwarted.  Eventually I found that you could refine it from other elements, specifically magnetite (which I am sure is also a Pokemon) and antimatter.  That meant heading to space, where I was disoriented as ever. Being at right angles to reality is kind of my thing… I headed out to the asteroids looking for my required materials. That’s no moon… that’s an asteroid There I was able to find my magnetite… assaying works… I just had trouble keep hold of it.  The mobs in space kept spotting me and killing me so I ended up having to mine about five times as much magnetite as I needed because the mobs were camping my corpse so it wasn’t worth the effort to try and defeat them.  I would have needed to spend time gaining more points in combat and upgrading that and building drones to support me… and I was kind of on limited time, having things to do in the afternoon. I got my magnetite, then went looking for antimatter and… came up dry.  I was not sure where that came from and the mobs were making me miserable, so I gave up and went back down to the planet and looked for some mischief to get into.  Sure, I could join others in digging mines, which I did for a bit.  Then I found a large natural rock formation like a giant mushroom and proceeded to saw through it with my extractor. Burning through the stem to see what happens When I had cleared a gap the whole thing sat there for a minute or so while the world no doubt considered how it should react to this particular set of circumstances… and then the whole thing sort of melted down, closing the gap and changing the shape of the structure. That was amusing enough that I did it again, with somebody else joining in just to see what would happen. Burning through… the next iteration That too proceeded to melt down after spending a Wiley Coyote duration floating in mid-air, waiting for gravity to glance over and catch it misbehaving.  Fun for the whole family. I ran around a bit after that, but my time was up and I had to go out and adult for a while.  We’ll see when the next test shows up.
