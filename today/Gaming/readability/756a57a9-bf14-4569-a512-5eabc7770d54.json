  "text": "Hello PlayStation readers! I’m Chris Darril, creator of Bye Sweet Carole and founder of Little Sewing Machine. Bye Sweet Carole is a special project, one that reimagines the animation that inspired me in childhood, interwoven with homages to video games that today’s players can relate to. Before the game launches on PlayStation, it’s my pleasure to introduce the ﬁrst and exclusive look at The French, a mysterious character found sneaking into Bunny Hall by Lana. They seem to have an interest in heat and ﬂames — could this be a clue to Carole’s disappearance? Introducing The French As mysterious as they look, this is clearly someone who has shared proximity with Carole. Eyes cast down, but what did they see? What intentions do they hide? Is there a secret in the burning ﬂames they hover around? Players will ﬁnd out alongside Lana soon enough. Drawing inspiration for a modern fairytale Shifting from making ﬁlms to video games has been a life-changing experience. Carole started off as a mistake: one day, while playing with my unﬁnished Remothered prototype in RPG Maker, I created a dreamy, cell-shaded protagonist. Instantly, the image reminded me of those early popular animated ﬁlms featuring pastel-coloured princesses against dark backdrops.  Connecting this visual concept to video games was the ﬁrst hurdle: titles like Resident Evil on the ﬁrst PlayStation, Clock Tower, and Gris were all foundational sources of gameplay inspiration. Their slow, measured approach to storytelling and unique atmospheres informed our initial development, reﬁned with modern messaging designed to evoke the same child-like awe in a now fully-grown video game player today. Moving pictures to interactive pictures As game designers, we are already directors, and the “cinematography” of video games is equally important. The presentation of a world makes an impact on the audience, and in both cinema and games, technology brings the storytelling to life. You’ll always meet technological limitations, so remaining ﬂuid is absolutely critical in the development stage.  You start with the concept, then jump to the storyboard, then the rough animation, clean-up, and then the colors. Exporting animation happens differently if it’s a cutscene, a video, or eventually a game scene, so you have to ﬁnd people just to export each animation. As with ﬁlmmaking, collaboration is key. The art \u0026 artists behind Bye Sweet Carole The animation of Bye Sweet Carole was hand-drawn, frame by frame. Sacriﬁcing even just one frame means the magic of the old-fashioned animation style is lost. Computers made the production much smoother, but we made certain that the tangible expression of the animation style is always felt when playing the game. PlayStation players will be able to see the true labour of love in full 4K display. We’ve also ensured that the visual and audio components work in harmony. The soundtrack was composed by Luca Balboni, a frequent collaborator. The large cast of characters will be fully voiced by Rossa Caputo in the Italian dub, Lani Minella (voice of the iconic Infected of The Last of Us), and Elsie Lovelock as our protagonist Lana. Conclusion Doing something that by today’s standards is considered “old school” wasn’t easy, and required a huge learning curve. On behalf of the entire team, we hope all players will enjoy meeting The French and experiencing Bye Sweet Carole later this year by purchasing the game from PlayStation Store or at their favourite retailer. We aspire for the game to be a modern fairytale, one that feels like a deep-seated memory: sad, yet peaceful, and long-lasting. It’s the best, most ambitious game I’ve ever worked on, and for those that missed it, our most recent trailer is a fantastic place to start. There is one more mystery I can shed light on today, and that is confirming that Bye Sweet Carole is available from major retailers on discs. Today, players who want to experience the nostalgia of physical pieces of media inspired by nostalgia can pre-order a copy now in many regions and storefronts. Of course, the PlayStation Store is always open for those that appreciate modern accessibility of digital copies. We still have several surprises to reveal about Bye Sweet Carole, so stay tuned—we’re incredibly excited to bring this love letter to life. Trending Stories",

The soundtrack was composed by Luca Balboni, a frequent collaborator. The large cast of characters will be fully voiced by Rossa Caputo in the Italian dub, Lani Minella (voice of the iconic Infected of The Last of Us), and Elsie Lovelock as our protagonist Lana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cvideo data-src=\"https://stream.mux.com/TU00Lep48sSswNO68daTVlfHydGVub01Ua8i7ehWtCbNU/capped-1080p.mp4?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJUVTAwTGVwNDhzU3N3Tk82OGRhVFZsZkh5ZEdWdWIwMVVhOGk3ZWhXdENiTlUiLCJhdWQiOiJ2IiwiZXhwIjoxNzUyNjcyMTIwLCJraWQiOiI0TDV5T2NqclYxTlVxVnpjVXZKQm4xd1RtNGVUR0c5TWgwMjAxWWs1anU5TkEifQ.JKqUlIuhddUZb5oUvfraKi_NhDof2exUzW1pqtoVqF8gvAIZvz0szA2kdAVeNBalkofyEv9IkP9YZabryBSzMA3mq8DjCwl9HlDesYr8ex8E9fxiz5znKjpd7xW1TXKXKkBoc_iX0G8-IpMSzb47WEz-w5N4QDBnQeLVB3jW8ldQNNjwy7sAW1aMn8g0K7Ac_pZRk08agKRJD4ijGJgpZtPAOsBWi2c1yui2g5sgMQ9Q5_LhYN29ygIU7HAYSrJoB3heBffUCETpMgsIYliFsoAtpSWrYEIyuhkeKiCpiptOkRPXwoxSluq9nCwLAgrstOl00auM_DMfIhw_tI02eA\" preload=\"metadata\" autoplay=\"\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"\"\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDoing something that by today’s standards is considered “old school” wasn’t easy, and required a huge learning curve. On behalf of the entire team, we hope all players will enjoy meeting The French and experiencing Bye Sweet Carole later this year by purchasing the game from \u003ca href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008528\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008528\"\u003ePlayStation Store\u003c/a\u003e or at their favourite retailer. We aspire for the game to be a modern fairytale, one that feels like a deep-seated memory: sad, yet peaceful, and long-lasting. It’s the best, most ambitious game I’ve ever worked on, and for those that missed it, our most recent trailer is a fantastic place to start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is one more mystery I can shed light on today, and that is confirming that Bye Sweet Carole is available from major retailers on discs. Today, players who want to experience the nostalgia of physical pieces of media inspired by nostalgia can pre-order a copy now in many regions and storefronts. Of course, the PlayStation Store is always open for those that appreciate modern accessibility of digital copies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe still have several surprises to reveal about Bye Sweet Carole, so stay tuned—we’re incredibly excited to bring this love letter to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003c/article\u003e\u003csection\u003e\n\t\u003ch2\u003eTrending Stories\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\t\n\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
