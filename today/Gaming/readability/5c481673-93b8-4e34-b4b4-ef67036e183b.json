  "text": "The PlayStation Network is suffering what appears to be a massive outage heading into the weekend. PlayStation 5 and PS4 Players across social media, including X and Reddit, are reporting being unable to connect to Sony’s online services, including multiplayer matches and the PlayStation Store. Suggested ReadingThe Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023OffEnglishSuggested ReadingUpdate 2/8/25 7:49 p.m. ET: PSN is fully back online after a roughly 24-hour outage, the longest downtime for the service in years. “PSN has been restored,” Sony announced Saturday evening through its Ask PlayStation X account. “You should be able to access online features without any problems now.” The company still has not confirmed why the network was down.Original story follows:“At this time, the PlayStation Network (including PlayStation Store) may not be available,” reads an announcement made by the Ask PlayStation Japan account on X at 7:12 p.m. ET on February 7. “We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers. We are currently investigating the issue and working to restore service, so please be patient.” It’s an especially unfortunate time for the network to go down with the last free Monster Hunter Wilds beta test weekend currently underway.There’s no information yet on what the cause of the outage is, how many people are affected, or when the service might come back online. While some service disruptions can last for just a few hours, others could go on for much longer, with spotty connection quality even as the network comes back online. The PlayStation status page currently lists all online services as being down. And so far this certainly seems to be one of the bigger outages PSN has suffered of late. Players started reporting getting disconnected shortly after 6:00 p.m. ET and so far there’s no sign of anyone being able to get back on. The outage also appears to be worldwide, rather than being isolated to certain countries or continents. Sony did not respond to a request for comment. The nightmare scenario for Sony would be a malicious hack or some deeper problem that causes the outage to persist for days or even weeks. That’s been unheard of in the modern era, but that’s what happened back in the infamous 2011 PlayStation Network outage. So far at least, there’s no sign that something on that scale is happening again. Hopefully, the system comes back online shortly. I, for one, was supposed to be spending tonight with my buds in Rocket League.Update 2/8/2025 8:58 a.m. ET: Welp, no Rocket League for me after all, or for anyone else. Over 12 hours later and PSN is still down with no new information on the cause of the outage or Sony’s timeline for bringing it back online. That could either be a sign the company is expecting to have it back up at any moment or a more ominous signal that something more serious is going on. Update 2/8/2025 6: 08 p.m. ET: It’s now been a full 24 hours since PSN went down yesterday and we still have no idea what’s going on. A full day later, the only new communication from Sony was a post promoting storage accessories for the PS5. There is some good news, however. At least some PSN users worldwide appear to finally be getting back online. There are early anecdotal reports of players in the UK and elsewhere being able to log in. Helldivers 2 dataminer IronS1ights also reported that players have been returning to the multiplayer alien shooter’s galactic war. Hopefully, service continues to be restored through the evening. In the meantime, everyone with a PSN account should probably update their password just to be safe. .",
