  "text": "Not only is the world of Labyrinth of the Demon King uniquely cold, oppressive, and brutal – but it is also a meticulously crafted narrative experience that weaves together elements of classic dungeon crawler titles, action RPGs, and the survival horror genre. In this challenging first-person dungeon-crawler set in a mythical re-interpretation of feudal Japan, you’ll need every resource you can find to overcome the demons that block your path. Prepare yourself to enter into the ubiquitous labyrinth yourself on May 13th, when Labyrinth of the Demon King launches on Xbox Series S|X and Xbox One systems. The world of Athens is weird, highly unusual, and filled with a host of surprises. Along the way, you’ll meet tons of friends (and foes!) as you navigate the world in your own unique way, you’ll decide how you want to interact not only with those you meet, but also the world itself. As the world shifts and you interact with denizens, you’ll begin to flesh out your very own rhapsody. You can meet 16 potential party members, all with tons of depth – the very world will change depending on who you have in your party when. Plus, every single enemy can be fought or befriended! You’ll also find smaller friends and foes to commune with, and find tons of unlockable outfits to deck yourself and your party out with. The world of Labyrinth of the Demon King is brought to life (so to speak, anyway) through its unique “retro-grim” art style. The game’s dark, foreboding world takes inspiration from authentic Japanese folklore and tradition; the developer spent extensive time in Japan studying architecture and history. Inspired by a mixture of mythologized feudal history and supernatural folklore, the setting of Labyrinth is as gorgeous as it is brutal. Venture through sprawling castles, idyllic teahouses, dilapidated bath houses and more as you make your way towards the Demon King himself. As a foot soldier of your former Lord, you must be not only well trained in the art of combat, but on your toes at all times for possible threats Labyrinth of the Demon King features brutal, challenging combat that emphasizes patience, strategy, and diligence. As you explore the labyrinth, you’ll come across a slew of weapons, including an axe, naginata, bow, and more – on top of your trusty katana, of course. Face off against the numerous Yokai of ancient myth that roam the earth, and put your skills to the test. You’ll need to study the moves of each monster you come across. Be assured however, that any victory – no matter how small – is an accomplishment. As the name suggests, the Demon King’s Labyrinth is complex, confusing, and full of twisted nooks and crannies full of monsters, treasure, traps, and sometimes…friends? As you adventure through the Labyrinth, carefully managing your resources, you’ll come across a handful of other denizens; some trekking throughout the lands like yourself and others with more…cautious goals and morals. Be careful who you trust – it could affect your fate! Developed by J.R. Hudepohl with co-development help, porting assistance for Xbox, and publishing by Top Hat Studios, Labyrinth of the Demon King lands on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One May 13.",
