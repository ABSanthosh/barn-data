I still feel the aloha sprit in my heart, though, and it’s keeping me warm and cozy in this chilly Bay Area day. How have your holidays been so far? I feel like mine flew by in the blink of an eye. Although I wanted to do so much more for everyone in my life, I’ve realized that at a certain point one just needs to accept that there’s only so many hours in the day and so much energy to go around, and you can only do the best you can.
