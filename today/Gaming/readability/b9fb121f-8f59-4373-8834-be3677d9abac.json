  "text": "May will mark 20 years since the Fate franchise’s humble beginnings. Since 2005, players have taken up the mighty hero mantle and bested the Dungeon Gate’s many creatures into oblivion. Over the years, the iconic dungeon crawler series has shaped childhoods, inspired future game developers, and left a mark on the action RPG genre as a whole. The creators of Fate would actually go on and create Torchlight afterwards, another highly successful dungeon crawler. Given the impact its had, it only seemed fitting that Fate’s 20-year anniversary be met with something just as special as the franchise itself – a thrilling remaster that actually stays true to why players loved it in the first place. Fate: Reawakened, launching March 12 for Xbox Series X|S, is truly the definitive edition of the award-winning dungeon crawler – offering all four existing Fate games in one action-packed bundle. The Rise of Fate When it originally launched, Fate was a beacon of new opportunity for the action RPG genre. In a sea of dark and moody RPG options at the time, the game instead leaned into a more bright and colorful art style which made it more appealing to younger folks and families. There was also a time when Fate actually came pre-installed on some Windows computers. This made the game extremely accessible and helped it rise in popularity and prominence over the coming years. People fell in love with the infinite challenges the dungeon depths provided, and the adorable pet options that could accompany them on their journey.   As the franchise grew, so did its community. Despite not having a new game entry since 2011, places like Discord, YouTube, and social media were still active with passionate Fate fans and modders. Having such a dedicated and engaged community after all these years is truly a testament to the impact Fate has had, so when the opportunity presented itself to pursue a new project with the franchise, we were excited about the prospect. An Idea is Sparked The opportunity to revisit Fate started around 2019 when gamigo acquired WildTangent, who originally released and owned the Fate series. The COVID pandemic in 2020 caused some delay in deciding how to best revisit the series, but it was important to us that we approach the project thoughtfully and carefully. Eventually we decided that releasing a remaster in honor of Fate’s 20th Anniversary would be the perfect way to bring the nostalgic franchise back into the limelight. A lot has changed since 2005 and while Fate’s gameplay still holds up today, we thought it was crucial that we expand its reach by modernizing it for the systems people flock to now. After all, up until Fate: Reawakened, the franchise had only been limited to PC platforms. Taking the game series to console and with additional language support meant tapping into a whole new audience we hadn’t yet explored. A Delicate Undertaking Tackling a beloved series can be an ambitious task, but altering Fate’s core DNA was never on the table. Instead, the goal with Fate: Reawakened was to take what already made the franchise great and make it even better. One of the biggest steps we took to ensure we were staying true to the heart of the series was bringing an alpha demo to PAX West 2024. While a chunk of our booth visitors were brand new to Fate, many others were familiar with it and had even grown up playing the game. Receiving feedback from both groups ended up being so invaluable. Existing Fate fans knew what to look for, how it should play, and could speak confidently about what they would want out of a remaster. Most importantly though, they also knew how a remaster should not feel. On the other side of the equation, watching brand new players venture through the alpha demo gave us insight into how someone not familiar with Fate would approach the game and revealed places they might get lost or confused. We went to PAX West eager to share our progress and left with a tremendously helpful list of bugs, improvements, and comments that we took very seriously as development continued. While PAX West gave us a nice broad mix of players both new and old, we knew we needed to please hardcore fans if we had any chance of getting this remaster to land properly. To tap into that audience, we ended up doing a closed beta with a select group of very active and engaged fans across Fate’s community. These players knew the game inside and out and were able to provide vital detailed feedback that resulted in additional tweaks and polish. The closed beta’s open dialogue was instrumental in making sure that we were on the right track to do the series justice. That’s not to say that we don’t have Fate fans internally though! Our team put in a lot of effort and care over the course of the development process. The dark and moody area of Druantia in particular was something that we spent a lot of time on. When we were initially adjusting the lighting for the remaster, we found that it was just far too bright and the area had lost much of its identity and flavor. It took multiple rounds of feedback to dial it in to a place that we felt truly captured the original vision. Reawakening Your Inner Hero Fate: Reawakened is meant to be a love letter not just to the series, but to the community. We’ve loved seeing all the creative ways players have continued to share their dedication all these years later. We’re excited to be entering the next era of the Fate franchise, and hope that you too will reawaken the hero inside of you. Are you ready to choose your Fate?

To tap into that audience, we ended up doing a closed beta with a select group of very active and engaged fans across Fate’s community. These players knew the game inside and out and were able to provide vital detailed feedback that resulted in additional tweaks and polish. The closed beta’s open dialogue was instrumental in making sure that we were on the right track to do the series justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure data-wp-context=\"{\u0026#34;uploadedSrc\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https:\\/\\/pub-f354ec240bea480db7320bd0e29d972e.r2.dev\\/sites\\/2\\/2025\\/03\\/TyphonDungeon-3840x2160-1-a0545cdceb00a166c0ee-scaled.jpg\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;figureClassNames\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;wp-block-image size-full\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;figureStyles\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;imgClassNames\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;wp-image-207304\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imgStyles\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;targetWidth\u0026#34;:2560,\u0026#34;targetHeight\u0026#34;:1440,\u0026#34;scaleAttr\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;ariaLabel\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Enlarge image: FATE: Reawakened Screenshot\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;alt\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;FATE: Reawakened Screenshot\u0026#34;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https://pub-f354ec240bea480db7320bd0e29d972e.r2.dev/sites/2/2025/03/TyphonDungeon-3840x2160-1-a0545cdceb00a166c0ee-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"FATE: Reawakened Screenshot\" srcset=\"https://pub-f354ec240bea480db7320bd0e29d972e.r2.dev/sites/2/2025/03/TyphonDungeon-3840x2160-1-a0545cdceb00a166c0ee-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://pub-f354ec240bea480db7320bd0e29d972e.r2.dev/sites/2/2025/03/TyphonDungeon-3840x2160-1-a0545cdceb00a166c0ee-768x432.jpg 768w, https://pub-f354ec240bea480db7320bd0e29d972e.r2.dev/sites/2/2025/03/TyphonDungeon-3840x2160-1-a0545cdceb00a166c0ee-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://pub-f354ec240bea480db7320bd0e29d972e.r2.dev/sites/2/2025/03/TyphonDungeon-3840x2160-1-a0545cdceb00a166c0ee-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://pub-f354ec240bea480db7320bd0e29d972e.r2.dev/sites/2/2025/03/TyphonDungeon-3840x2160-1-a0545cdceb00a166c0ee-2048x1152.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s not to say that we don’t have Fate fans internally though! Our team put in a lot of effort and care over the course of the development process. The dark and moody area of Druantia in particular was something that we spent a lot of time on. When we were initially adjusting the lighting for the remaster, we found that it was just far too bright and the area had lost much of its identity and flavor. It took multiple rounds of feedback to dial it in to a place that we felt truly captured the original vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReawakening Your Inner Hero\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFate: Reawakened\u003c/em\u003e is meant to be a love letter not just to the series, but to the community.
