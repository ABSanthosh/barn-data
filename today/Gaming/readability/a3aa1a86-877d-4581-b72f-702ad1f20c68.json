What's coming in season three? Wesley Snipes and a bloody great burning bird lady. By which I mean, Blade and Phoenix. They'll be matching wits with Hela, goddess of death, who has palled up with Knull, god of symbiotes, aka the wriggly black pyjamas sported by Venom. All of this may seem frightening and bizarre if you're here because you accidentally hit auto-complete while googling \"Marks \u0026 Spencers opening times\", so here's a swift trailer to fill you in. Season 3: The Abyss Awakens Official Trailer | Fire and Shadow Collide on July 11th! | Marvel Rivals Watch on YouTube How about that? Nicely surgical bit of techno, I thought, definitely has me itching for the dance floor. The new season begins on 11th July. Here's some official blurb for that trailer. \"In the wake of the Timestream Entanglement, Knull stirs deep within Klyntar's core, stretching his shadowed hands across the cosmos. Power promised by the dark symbiote god beckons the awakening of a new queen. The Phoenix arrives from across the stars to erase Klyntar before the darkness can rise again! However, she'll require unlikely aid from a warrior of two worlds who lives to fight against the tide of night.\" \"As the god of the symbiotes and the Phoenix Force collide, will you burn with the light of creation or embrace the darkness?\" the trailer blurb concludes. I choose to translate this as: do you want Phoenix Force skins or Symbiote skins? As for how the new characters play, leaks suggest that they're both DPS roles. There's also talk of new hero team-ups and some \"anti-heal\" mechanics, given away by new voice lines. It's probable one of the new heroes has the power to shut down health replenishment. We've not covered Marvel Rivals much lately due to a shortage of hands at the wheel and greymass for the ever-expanding hero roster. It remains a popular game, with 56,735 people playing at the time of writing.",
