  "text": "Welcome back to the Midnight Murder Club. Here at Velan Studios, we’ve been toiling away in the shadowy halls of Wormwood Manor, coming up with fresh, new ways for you to hunt your friends in the darkness. We’ve got a new game mode to announce and a new way to get your friends in on the fighting! Midnight Murder Club is a first-person shooter/party game where you and five friends hunt each other in the pitch-black rooms of the mysterious Wormwood Manor.* Armed with only a revolver and a flashlight, search the shadows for every flicker of light and every bump in the night as you stalk your prey. The tension turns to hilarity as you discover just how tricky it is to navigate and shoot in complete darkness! You sprint toward your friends’ shouting voices echoing through the mansion, only to bump into someone else hiding in a dark corner! Shots ring out, luring the other hunters to your location. Every flash of light is the promise of a deadly firefight.  New game mode: Wildcards On top of the existing Free for All, Thief in the Night, Team Deathmatch, and Headhunters modes, we’re excited to introduce a new mode that lets you break the rules like never before! In the new Wildcards game mode, players play cards from their collection that change the rules for everyone in-game in wild new ways. From hijacking the toys that appear in vendors, to giving everyone super speed, to exploding into flames when you die—use these cards to show your wild side. Then, when the dust settles and the match is over you’ll be gifted new cards to add to your collection, giving you even more ways to change the game. In the new Wildcards game mode, it looks like chaos is in the cards! Play at no additional cost with the Midnight Murder Club Guest Pass Edition We know that playing with friends is the best way to play any game and with the Midnight Murder Club Guest Pass Edition, it’s easier than ever. Midnight Murder Club Guest Pass Edition allows your friends to join your game and play for no additional cost! To put it simply: If one person buys the game, they can invite up to five Guest Pass Edition players to play together for no additional cost in public or private matches, in all current game modes, as much as you want. We’re really excited about the Guest Pass Edition because Midnight Murder Club is a great party game to play with friends. Now players can simply invite their friends into the club and let the mayhem begin.  Burning the midnight oil To sum it up, we’re adding the new Wildcards game mode and introducing a new way to play with friends with the Guest Pass Edition. That’s a lot of new development work! Because of that, we’re going to need a little more time, so we’re pushing our Early Access launch date to March 13th, 2025. The full version of the game will be available in Early Access for $19.99 (or equivalent in your region), and the Guest Pass Edition will be launching on the same day for no additional cost. As a member of the Midnight Murder Club, your opinion on the direction the club should go matters! We’re determined to evolve this game with the community as we continue developing through Early Access. We want your opinions and ideas, which will help shape our roadmap (which we’ll be sharing before launch!). With these major changes and much more to come, we can’t wait to dive back into the darkness and haunt the hallowed halls of the Wormwood Manor with you. Prepare yourselves for Midnight Murder Club coming to Early Access on PS5 and Steam on March 13. See you in the shadows! *Account for PlayStation Network and internet connection required.
