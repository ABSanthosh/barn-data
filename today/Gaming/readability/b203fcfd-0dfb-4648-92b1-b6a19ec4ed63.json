  "text": "REPOSE makes every step through its gloomy, monster-filled halls count as you search for precious oxygen tanks. But does your death matter? You wake up to see someone getting torn apart by tentacles right in front of you. Lovely start to the day, as your next step is directly past whatever just ripped your fellow spacefaring buddy to pieces. While it doesn’t kill you next, you likely won’t survive long given the strange gun-toting (and tentacle-sporting) folks in space suits meandering the facility as well. Despite taking a shotgun blast to the face, though, you just wake up in a cafe to a woman telling you that you’ve got a fun job to do: collecting oxygen tanks. Hopefully that dream didn’t scare you too badly. You’ll find that you have an extremely limited amount of energy to carry out your search as you comb through the ruined futuristic landscape. Every action you take (besides spinning in place to get your bearings) costs a unit of energy, and once those are gone, you’re dead on the spot. You can recover your energy if you find a bed and sleep, but you’ll need to hope you locate one while you search. Which, given the maze-like environments and the creatures roaming around looking to kill you, doesn’t happen often. Still, despite the frequency you meet your demise, you always wake up in bed again with all the doors you previously opened still being unlocked. REPOSE is an eerie exploration of an unsettling 1-bit future filled with dangerous beasts and limited means of avoiding them without dying of exhaustion. Still, its deeper questions of the meaning of your deaths keep pushing you forward, using your curiosity to drag you ever-deeper into this place no matter how many bullets are rolling around that head of yours in the end. REPOSE is available now on itch.io and Steam.
