Luckily, despite the rash of cancellations affecting everything from the Batgirl movie to HBO Max shows like Titans and Doom Patrol, it's not all bad news. James Gunn and Peter Safran are now the co-CEOs of DC Studios, and they have a strategy for a more cohesive and interconnected lineup of content moving forward. It all starts with Chapter 1, dubbed \"Gods and Monsters.\"It can be very difficult to keep track of all the big changes at DC these days. That's why we've put together this comprehensive list of everything currently in the works, as well as the major projects that have either been officially canceled or gone dormant.Come join us in the reborn DC Universe. Click on through the slideshow below for a glimpse or read on for even more details...And for more on what to expect from DC in 2024, including comics and games, follow the link!What Are the Next DC Movies Coming Out? 2024 Release DatesDC Universe: Every Upcoming Movie and TV ShowFor those keeping track, here's the full lineup of upcoming DC movies and TV shows:Superman \u0026 Lois: Season 4 (October 7, 2024)Creature Commandos Animated Series (December 5, 2024)Superman (July 11, 2025)The Sandman Season 2 (2025)Peacemaker Season 2 (2025)Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (June 26, 2026)The Batman Part II (October 2, 2026)The Brave and the Bold (In Development)The Authority (In Development)Swamp Thing (In Development)Teen Titans Movie (In Development)Bane/Deathstroke Movie (In Development)Dynamic Duo (Animated Robin Origin Movie) (In Development)Waller TV Series (In Development)Booster Gold TV Series (In Development)Paradise Lost TV Series (In Development)Lanterns TV Series (In Development)Blue Beetle Animated Series (In Development)Harley Quinn and Other Animated Titles (In Development)Constantine 2 (Status Unknown)Gotham PD/Arkham TV Series (Possibly Canceled)Here are some of the most notable projects that are currently in the works:Superman \u0026 Lois: Season 4 (October 7, 2024)The Arrowverse as we once knew it is gone. With the end of The Flash in 2023, the only show left -- and even it claims to take place on a different Earth from most of the rest of the Arrowverse shows! -- is Superman \u0026 Lois. While observers expected the show to be cancelled after Season 3, a 10-episode fourth and final season debuted on Oct. 7 (reportedly with a reduced cast and budget).Creature Commandos Animated Series (December 5, 2024)Surprisingly, Gunn is relying on one of DC's most obscure properties to launch the new DCU. Gunn has written a seven-episode first season of this animated series, which deals with Amanda Waller forming another team of incarcerated super-criminals to save the world. The Creature Commandos series will be released in December, 2024, beating Superman to the finish line.Creature Commandos CoversSuperman (July 11, 2025)We can all stop holding our breath for Man of Steel 2. Rather than pursue a sequel to the 2013 film, DC is pushing ahead with a new take on the character with Superman (formerly known as Superman: Legacy). James Gunn wrote and directs this Superman movie featuring a younger Clark Kent early in his reporting career (though it won't be an origin story). The film will explore Clark's struggle to balance his Kryptonian heritage with his Kansas upbringing and deal with the challenge of being a kind hero in an unkind world. The film is shaping up to be one of the first and most important entries in the revamped DCU line. David Corenswet stars as Superman, Rachel Brosnahan is Lois Lane and X-Men: First Class' Nicholas Hoult plays Lex Luthor.The Sandman Season 2 (2025)Despite widespread critical acclaim and what appears to have been a very successful debut on Netflix, it took several months for the streamer to announce that The Sandman was renewed. Netflix did finally confirm that new episodes are in the works, though they shied away from describing it as \"Season 2\" initially. That may suggest Netflix plans to release new episodes in smaller batches, similar to how Season 1 was followed up by the surprise release of an eleventh episode. Peacemaker Season 2 (2025)Not everything is being completely rebooted for the new DCU. James Gunn's Peacemaker is getting an Amanda Waller spinoff series as well as a second season. We don't know much about Season 2 yet, though Gunn did tease a mystery character on social media in October, 2024.Every New DCEU Character According to PeacemakerSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (June 26, 2026)The new DCU will also have a new Supergirl. Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow is a movie based on Tom King and Bilquis Evely's comic of the same name. This Supergirl is one who spent much of her early life living on a fragment of Krypton that was dislodged in the planet's destruction, what Gunn describes as a \"horrible situation where she watched everybody around her die.\" House of the Dragon's Milly Alcock plays Supergirl, and Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya, Cruella) directs the film.The Batman Part II (Oct. 2, 2026)Of course The Batman Part II is in the works with Matt Reeves returning to write and direct and Robert Pattinson putting on the cape, cowl, and eyeliner (!) again as the Dark Knight Detective. The film is confirmed to have survived the recent turmoil at Warner Bros. Discovery, and Reeves has even signed a multi-year first-look deal with the studio. There's no word yet on what it will be about, so begin your Joker speculation now. In March of 2024, the release date of the film was pushed a full year from October 2025 to October 2026.The Brave and the Bold (In Development)DC has confirmed that we'll have two cinematic versions of Batman going forward, as the DCU will get its own Dark Knight alongside the standalone movies of Matt Reeves' The Batman series. The Brave and the Bold looks to deal with the full Bat-family, centering specifically on Bruce Wayne's 10-year-old son Damian. The movie will draw heavily from Grant Morrison's Batman comics. It is unclear how the film will connect to the events of The Flash movie, if at all, but that film's director, Andy Muschietti, is confirmed to be directing The Brave and the Bold.The Authority (In Development)DC's anti-Justice League are getting their own movie in the new DCU. The Authority is a group of powerful heroes who take a far more proactive approach to meting out justice. Swamp Thing (In Development)Swamp Thing may not have found much success on the short-lived DC Universe app, but DC is still betting big on this lumbering monster for their new cinematic universe. The Swamp Thing movie will explore the dark origins of Alec Holland's monstrous alter ego. Logan and Indiana Jones 5 director James Mangold is writing the script for the film.Teen Titans (In Development)The Teen Titans are returning to live-action following the conclusion of Max's Titans series. As reported by THR, a new Teen Titans movie is in the works, with the screenplay being penned by Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow writer Ana Nogueira. It's unknown whether the movie is meant to be part of the DCU or a standalone project.Bane/Deathstroke Movie (In Development)The Hollywood Reporter broke the news that DC Studios is developing a villain-centric team-up movie featuring Bane and Deathstroke. The film is being written by Matthew Orton (Captain America: Brave New World). It's unclear whether the project is set in James Gunn's DCU, the world of Matt Reeves' The Batman, or an entirely standalone universe a la Joker.Dynamic Duo (Animated Robin Origin Movie) (In Development)According to James Gunn, Dynamic Duo will tell the origin story of not one but two Robins -- Dick Grayson and Jason Todd. The film will be directed by Arthur Mintz, who's making the film with his new animation studio Swaybox using a mix of animation, puppetry, CGI, and live-action performance. Huh.Waller TV Series (In Development)This Peacemaker spin-off will feature Viola Davis reprising the Amanda Waller role in a series that builds on the ending of Peacemaker: Season 1. Several other Peacemaker alums will also return.Booster Gold TV Series (In Development)The lovably goofy Booster Gold is getting his own series as part of the new DCU. Booster Gold will explore the character's impostor syndrome as he travels back in time and uses the technology of the future to make himself a present-day superhero.Paradise Lost TV Series (In Development)While a new Wonder Woman movie isn't on the immediate horizon, DC is moving forward with a TV series set on the island of Themyscira. Paradise Lost will explore the origins and political intrigue of Diana's home. The series is billed as the DC equivalent of Game of Thrones.Lanterns TV Series (In Development)We're (hopefully) finally getting that oft-promised Green Lantern show. Lanterns is a high-concept detective drama in the vein of True Detective. The series revolves around Hal Jordan and John Stewart. It's unclear if this series is at all connected to the Green Lantern Corps show that Greg Berlanti was executive producing at one time for HBO Max. Kyle Chandler has been cast as Hal and Aaron Pierre has been cast as John.DC Movies and TV Shows That Were Released in 2023Legion of Super-Heroes (February 7, 2023)Superman \u0026 Lois, Season 3 (March 14, 2023)Gotham Knights (March 14, 2023)Shazam!
