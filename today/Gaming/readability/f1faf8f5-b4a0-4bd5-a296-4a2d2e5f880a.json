  "text": "The best iPad for most people.There are already some great Apple Black Friday deals available, but this is one of the very best. Amazon has just dropped prices across the board on various Apple iPad models for Black Friday, including the newest Apple iPad. Right now, the 10th gen Apple iPad is down to $249.99 after you clip the $29.01 off coupon on the product page. This is the best price we've seen ever since it was launched back in 2022 and I am certain it won't drop again for Black Friday.Apple iPad 10.9\" 10th Gen for $249.99iPad 10th Gen 10.9\" 64GBFor most people, the iPad (not the Air, Mini, or Pro) is the best model to get because it offers nearly all the benefits of the iOS operating system and snappy performance at an affordable price. This model has significant improvements over its predecessor. For starters, it boasts a larger 10.9\" screen without adding to the overall dimensions thanks to a slimmer bezel. It also has a faster A14 Bionic chip, which is a 20% increase in CPU performance and 10% increase in GPU performance over the A13. It's now compatible with the Magic Folio keyboard so you can convert it into a mini laptop for better workflow (making it one of the best iPads for students). Other practical upgrades include the transition to a universal USB Type-C port, a better camera, and an updated Wi-Fi 6 protocol.The model on sale right now is equipped with 64GB of internal storage and Wi-Fi (not LTE) connectivity. All color options (Silver, Blue, Pink, and Yellow) are discounted and ship out in November. Choosing a model with more storage or celluluar connectivity will cost you a lot more. Value-wise, keep it simple and go with the base model.More Apple iPad Deals for Black FridayShould You Wait Until Black Friday?Black Friday is the best opportunity to score some great deals on electronics, and Apple products are no exception. You might be wondering just how low these prices can go. Although we have no direct feedback from Apple themselves, we have years of our own historical price trends to back up our predictions. At this point, Black Friday is close enough that there's certainly no harm waiting. We might see as much as a $50 or even $100 price drop on the more expensive models like the iPad Air or iPad Pro. The iPad and iPad Mini might drop another $20 at most if retailers are feeling generous. If Amazon isn't your preferred vendor (or if it runs out of stock), I expect these deals to be available at Best Buy and Walmart as well. The Apple Store will also host its own Black Friday Sale, although these deals usually aren't nearly as good.Looking for more iPad resources?If you're not sure which iPad is best for you, we have an iPad guide which details which iPad is ideal for which use case. If you intend want to get an iPad for schoolwork, we have an iPad guide for students as well. If you're looking for options outside of iOS, check out the best Android tablets of 2024.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
