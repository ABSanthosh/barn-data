All aboard for a puzzle game that's just the ticket! Seller:Short Circuit Studio TouchArcade Rating:Unrated Compatibility:HD Universal The wooden toys aesthetic is adorable! (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠)~♡ Made it to 01L28. Pretty good start to get the hang of gameplay. Now I need to sleep because it's 4:28 a. m. ༼⁠;⁠´⁠༎ຶ⁠ ⁠۝ ⁠༎ຶ⁠༽ This was an instabuy for me. You had me at \"level editor\" (although I can't edit but love to play others levels). A couple of notes. It would be nice to have re-start option for the level. And sometimes the swipe is not intuitive. Otherwise another great one. So is it kind of like Railbound? Staff Member Patreon Bronze Can we get an undo option that resets our last move? Great game!!I agree that the swipe inputs could use some tweaking. To “restart” the level, you can tap the red trash can in the lower-left, then select the it again when the menu opens. That removes all the track that you’ve laid down. Thanks for the input we are looking into tweaking it so it feels more \"smooth\". I am writing down everything to the team so we will get started with all the requested features for the next big update! It's our take on a trains puzzle game. But you could say it has similarities with Railbound and Trainyard to mention a few You had me at Trainyard (and because it’s you lot). Can’t find no gameplay videos but is this like an old puzzle game I used to play called RGB express? Not sure haven’t heard about this one before. Need to look it up It certainly has some similarities to RGBE. High praise; it’s an awesome little game. Thank you!

We have some awesome feature coming up as well as more chapters, mechanics, levels etc. New Patch 1.0.3 is submitted! The following is added to the game: Undo feature, undo your drawing or erasing.
