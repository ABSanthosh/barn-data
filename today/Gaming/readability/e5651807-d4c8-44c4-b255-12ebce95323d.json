NetEase and Bungie have announced an all-new Destiny mobile game called Destiny Rising.

Check out the developer preview trailer below to hear directly from the developers about what makes Destiny Rising unique in a crowded market for mobile games. In September, the existence of a Destiny mobile game from Bungie and NetEase leaked. It followed from the news in 2018 that NetEase would given Bungie $100 million to make non-Destiny games. Perhaps that arrangement has changed, as Destiny Rising is definitely a Destiny game, or there might be more in the works between Bungie and NetEase.In addition to Destiny Rising, Bungie is working on a survival shooter called Marathon and apparently other projects as well. Bungie underwent significant changes in 2024, including mass layoffs that affected several senior staffers. Additionally, some inside Bungie are joining a new team within parent company Sony to create a new action game. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com",
