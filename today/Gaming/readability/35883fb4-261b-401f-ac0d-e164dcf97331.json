  "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. A good book you’ve read recently? I really enjoyed “Killers of a Certain Age” by Deanna Raybourn. I’ve been needing a fast, fun read and it hit the spot! Next time you need a book for a plane ride or a vacation, grab it. 2. If you could move anywhere in the world without having to put any effort into it at all (assume someone takes care of the packing, logistics, paperwork, finances, etc.), where would you go? I’d move us to the Manoa neighborhood on Oahu in a heartbeat. 3. What’s a weird breakfast that you like to eat? I don’t know if it’s super weird, but I do love a toasted frozen waffle slathered with peanut butter and sprinkled with raisins.

I don’t know if it’s super weird, but I do love a toasted frozen waffle slathered with peanut butter and sprinkled with raisins. I don’t know how I got the idea, but I started eating it in college, and ever since then, it’s been my go-to quickie meal for breakfast or really any time of the day. When I was pregnant with Connor, it was pretty much all I wanted to eat, so the big joke around here is that her body was built on peanut butter, Eggo waffles and raisins! 4. How do you spend your breaks at work? I like to save my morning and afternoon breaks and tack them onto my lunch so I can take a longer break in the middle of the day. When I take that longer lunch break, I usually go home, take Marnie out for a quick walk, and then eat lunch while I read at the kitchen table. If I do decide to take a morning or afternoon break, I’ll go out for a quick walk to move my body around. Staring at a computer screen for hours does me no favors, ya know? 5. Do dreams come true? I like to think so! Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon. 1. A good book you’ve read recently? 2.
