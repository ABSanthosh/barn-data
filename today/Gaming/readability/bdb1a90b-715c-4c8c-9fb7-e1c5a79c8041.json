If you're still unsure of what to get for dad, a brand new iPad is a surefire gift that will win him over. Starting this week, Amazon has dropped the prices on all of the newest models, including the stadnard Apple iPad, the iPad Air, the iPad Mini, and even the iPad Pro M4 with tandem OLED display. Sizeable discounts on current model iPads are relatively uncommon, so get in on one of these deals while they last.$50 Off 2025 Apple iPad 10.9\" (A16)For most people, the iPad (not the Air, Mini, or Pro) is the best model to get because it offers all the benefits of iOS as well as snappy performance at an affordable price. The current generation model was released on March 12, 2025, over two years after the previous generation (October 2022). The upgrades include a more powerful processor (A16 vs A14), more RAM (6GB vs 4GB), and more storage (128GB vs 64GB), all. Best of all, the launch price of $349 is actually lower than when the previous generation model was released, which was $399.$100 Off the 2025 iPad Air M3Apple iPad Air 11\" (M3) 128GBApple iPad Air 13\" (M3) 128GBAmazon is offering the 7th generation Apple iPad Air M3 tablets at the lowest prices I've seen so far. The 11\" model is down to $499 and the 13\" model is down to $699, both after a $100 off instant discount. That's the best price we've seen for this 2025 model with the M3 chip. The 7th gen iPad Pro Air was released in March and is the current generation model. It's only one year newer than the 6th gen model and the only major upgrade is the jump from the M2 to the M3 chip.$100 off 2024 iPad Mini A17 ProApple iPad Mini (A17 Pro) 128GBStarting this week, Amazon is offering the current generation Apple iPad Mini (A17 Pro) for only $399.99 shipped after a $100 discount. The new iPad Mini was released in October of 2024 and features some pretty significant improvements over its predecessor, including a more powerful A17 Pro processor, double the base storage capacity, an updated faster Wi-Fi 6e protocol, a USB Type-C port that offers faster charging, and compatibility with the newer Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Pencil (USB-C), and Apple Intelligence.Up to $200 Off 2024 iPad Pro M4Apple iPad Pro 11-Inch (M4) 256GBApple iPad Pro 13-Inch (M4) 256GBThe 2024 iPad Pro is the best tablet on the market, iOS or otherwise, thanks to the new M4 processor, which is both powerful and power-efficient. Compared to the previous generation, iPad M2, it performs about 20% better. However, the biggest update of the iPad Pro is not the M4 chip, but instead the tandem OLED panel which hadn't previously been seen on an Apple product. Tandem OLED is better than traditional OLED in two ways: 1) it's far brighter, and 2) it's less prone to burn-in. If you're wondering why this technology hasn't found its way into TVs, the answer is simply because it's not cost-effective at larger sizes. The iPad can get away with it because the 11\" screen is much smaller, but that's also a major reason why the iPad Pro is priced considerably higher than the other iPads in Apple's 2024 lineup.Looking for more iPad resources?If you're not sure which iPad is best for you, we have an iPad guide which details which iPad is ideal for which use case.
