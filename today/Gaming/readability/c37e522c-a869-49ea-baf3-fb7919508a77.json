  "text": "While MercurySteam’s latest action-adventure may look like a hack-and-slash on the surface, it’s anything but that! Blades of Fire has an incredibly unique combat system, one that is both challenging and incredibly rewarding. Today, we’re going to take a deep dive into what to expect, and share some top tips that will help you on your adventure. For those unaware of Blades of Fire, let us set the scene. Blades of Fire takes place in a world reigned by Queen Nerea. You play as Aran de Lira, firstborn of the King’s Ward Commander. Your mission is simple, but weighty – take down the Queen, for she has cast a spell that has turned steel into stone. Only her army of enemies wield the divine metal against which other blades shatter. It’s up to you to forge your future and honour your duty. Welcome to the Forge In Blades of Fire, weapons are created and shaped in the Forge, which is accessible via the many anvils dotted around the world. Here, you’ll need to choose a weapon. Blades of Fire features 7 weapon families: Spears, Swords, Sabers, Greatswords, Twins, Daggers and Polearms, as well as over 30 unique Forge Scrolls that are obtainable throughout your adventure. These will allow endless opportunities for different weapon combinations. Once you’ve selected a Forge Scroll, you can then begin customising your weapon. Small changes can make big differences, so look carefully at how each adjustment will impact the weapon you create. Once you’re happy with your selection, it’s time to shape your weapon. Check out our Blades of Fire – Guide to the Forge Tutorial for more info.  Enter Battles Prepared Now you’ve forged a weapon, it’s time to put it to the test. Before entering combat in Blades of Fire, take a moment to understand your foe. Not every weapon you forge will be effective against every enemy. In some instances, what should be a simple battle could develop into something much more exhausting, if you don’t take the time to analyse the situation. When approaching an enemy, target it to see an outline. This colour of the outline will highlight how affective your weapon will be against it. Green – Your weapon will be effective. You’re ready to go! Yellow – Moderately effective. Red – Not worth the effort! Switch to a more effective weapon. Trust us when we say, you won’t get away with button bashing in Blades of Fire. It won’t end well! Don’t get greedy. Remember weapons are your allies. Make sure you handle them with care! While you’ll have the option to repair and reforge your weapons throughout your journey, you’ll need to acquire steel to do so. Weapons can be sharpened in battle using the Sharpening Stone, but there are consequences. Doing this will lower its durability. If you want to fully restore your weapon, you’ll need to head to one of the many Anvils dotted around the world. But how many repairs your weapon can go through is determined by the forging stars your earned during its creation.  Every battle you enter will impact your weapons in some way. Keep a close eye on their condition. Oh, and one other thing! Be selective and consider saving your best weapons for the tougher foes later down the line. You’ll thank us later! Tactical Combat Blades of Fire’s combat system is unique and one that allows the player to attack specific parts of an enemy, depending on which button your select on your controller. Use your weapon of choice to strike an enemy on their head (by pressing Y) torso (A) or the left (X) and right (B) sides of them. Attack with speed by quickly pressing any of the buttons above, or with strength by holding one of those buttons down. String any of these attacks together to unleash devastating combos. Weapons (depending on which you select) deal slashing, piercing or blunt damage. Again, look at the enemy you’re up against and go for the attack in the most effective way possible. Of course, you’ll also need to defend yourself in battle and there are four ways to protect yourself. Aran can dodge, roll, block and parry. How affective these methods are is dependent on the situation you’re in. Against a larger enemy? Dodging or rolling will be your best bet. Look after yourself out there, as all this defensive work comes at a cost. In Blades of Fire, your stamina is impacted in numerous ways. Getting through this dangerous world will play havoc will your energy levels. However, there are ways to re-energise! For example, execute a successful parry in battle and you’ll be granted unlimited stamina for a short period of time. This will help you take down multiple enemies efficiently and effectively. Holding LT in battle will recover your stamina quickly. This technique is known as The Breath of the Defender. It’s vital you use this in battle. Top Tip – Attack your enemies from the high ground where you can! It’s less tiresome and super effective! Teamwork Makes the Dream Work Throughout your adventure, you won’t be alone. You’ll be accompanied by Adso de Zelk, a young student of the Abbey of Egion. Adso offers valuable support and can be seen analysing enemies and documenting their behaviours in his travel book. Pay close attention to his notes – they’ll prove invaluable in combat! Forge Your Legend It feels like we’ve only scratched the surface of what Blades of Fire’s combat system offers and honestly, the best way to learn more is to play the game for yourself.
