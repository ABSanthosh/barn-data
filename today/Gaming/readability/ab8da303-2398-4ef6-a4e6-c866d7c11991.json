  "text": "Chick-fil-A, the popular fast food chain that specializes in chicken and donating millions to anti-LGBTQ groups, is launching a streaming and entertainment app next month and, alongside it, an animated TV show for kids. 2024 continues to suck!Suggested ReadingLive Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'Suggested ReadingOn October 21, Chick-fil-A announced that it would release its new free entertainment app, Chick-fil-A Play, on November 18. The app will include scripted “kid-friendly” podcasts, interactive games, jokes, video recipes, crafting ideas, e-books, and original, exclusive streaming shows. One of these shows will feature the Chick-fil-A cows—stars of the chain’s long-running “Eat Mor Chikin” campaign—and another is Evergreen Hills. Here’s the first trailer for Evergreen Hills, which appears to be an animated series about kids discovering some magical tree, and is based on a series of ads from a few years ago. If you’re curious, the animated series starring cows will likely look a lot like this short released by Chick-fil-A a few months ago. I’ll let you decide if that’s a good thing or not. Also, just say the words “A Chick-fil-A Original Story” a few times out loud and really marinate in how bad this all is.And now, here’s a human being trying to convince you that it’s totally normal and logical that a fast food restaurant that serves chicken sandwiches should also make TV shows for kids. From the press release:“Hospitality and fun have always been at the core of the Chick-fil-A family experience, whether inside our Restaurants and play areas, or through our Kids Meals,” said Dustin Britt, executive director of brand strategy. “The Chick-fil-A Play App is a digital extension of that experience and another way we’re reimagining ‘Play’ for our Guests, in a unique way through entertainment that really encourages time together.”That’s a terrifying amount of buzzwords and nonsense crammed into one paragraph, but it is October, so I guess it’s perfectly spooky. Anyway, if you want to watch any of this stuff or read books approved by Chick-fil-A, the app goes live on Apple and Android on November 18. Enjoy? .",
