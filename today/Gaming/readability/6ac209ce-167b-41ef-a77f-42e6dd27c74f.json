We’re excited to announce that Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles is coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, offering nostalgic thrills for returning Jedi and a gripping experience for new padawans. A long-awaited battle is back in full force Originally released in 2000, get ready to battle your way through iconic locations from Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. Whether you’re fighting to take back the Theed Palace from the Trade Federation or facing off against hordes of battle droids, destroyer droids, and deadly assassins, you’ll need all the skill and precision of a Jedi to succeed. In Jedi Power Battles, the power of the Force is in your hands. Grasp your lightsaber and cut through enemies in fast-paced, side-scrolling arcade action. The game allows you to play as beloved characters from the prequel trilogy, including Mace Windu, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Padme, Panaka, Plo Koon, Adi Gallia, and Qui-Gon Jinn. Celebrating 25 years with all new features The 2025 release includes new and improved features that enhance the gameplay experience: Lightsaber Toggle: For returning players who remember playing each Jedi with a distinctive color to their lightsaber, you may also remember those sabers not matching their looks in the films. For example, the original game showcased Mace Windu with a blue Lightsaber. For this release, we added a toggle that allows you to swap between his iconic purple saber or the classic blue saber. This also applies to Ki-Adi Mundi, Plo Koon, \u0026 Adi Gallia’s classic saber colors. All secret characters and levels unlocked at the beginning: Experience the full game right from the start, with all the original secret characters and levels unlocked, allowing you to dive straight into the battle without delay. Beyond the original lineup, we’ve introduced 13 newly unlocked playable characters! You’ll find the Rifle Droid, Staff Tusken Raider, Ishi Tib, and Weequay, ready to jump into the action, and more character announcements are coming before launch day. Who else is joining the roster? We’ll all find out soon enough. Gameplay improvements and expanded game modes: We’ve made enhancements to the character models, environments, and game modes based on the expanded post-PlayStation release, while also preserving elements of the original PlayStation UI. Enjoy smoother jumps, better balance, and new main menu art that transforms your battle from all of the original versions of the game. Additionally, we’ve included in-game UI toggle options for greater customization, and we’ve brought back Vs Mode and Training Mode from the expanded post-PlayStation release, adding depth and variety to your gameplay. Classic couch co-op: The entire 10-level campaign, along with additional bonus mini-games, can be played with a friend in local co-op mode. The joy of teaming up with a buddy to take down waves of enemies is a core part of the Jedi Power Battles experience, and it’s back in full force. Cheat codes and unlockables: Classic cheats like Big Head Mode, Big Foot Mode, and Lightsaber cheats are ready to be claimed! Additionally, unlock character progressions (combos, stats) by achieving high scores to keep the gameplay fresh and rewarding. Lastly, brand-new for the first time, the Loader Droid Boss is playable via cheat code! Ready to join the battle? Whether you’re a returning player or new to the battle, get ready for an adventure in the Star Wars galaxy. We’ve brought this classic back out of our deep love for Star Wars, and we hope you find joy in every lightsaber swing and every battle won. May the Force be with you—always. Get ready to join the battle on January 23, 2025! Prepare by pre-ordering Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles on PS5 \u0026 PS4 today.  Trending Stories",
