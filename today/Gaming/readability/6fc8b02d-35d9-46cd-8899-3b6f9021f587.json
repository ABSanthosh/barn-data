You'll miss out on the satisfaction of building your PC from the ground up, but all that time you saved skipping research, having to wait for components to arrive, building your machine, and inevitably problem-solving when something goes awry can be spent actually playing PC games. The half-baked prebuilt systems of yesteryear are no more, cutting far fewer corners for a long-lasting gaming PC that can take on all the action you throw its way. With the latest and greatest graphics cards and processors becoming pricier than ever, you may even save money by opting for something from Alienware, MSI, or HP. Plus, most options are easy enough to open up to upgrade components down the road, including our favorite gaming PC, the Legion Tower 7i.TL;DR – These Are the Best Gaming PCs:Buying a gaming PC is a bit more involved than a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S. You’ll need to determine the types of games you want to play and how you want to play them – even the best budget gaming PCs won’t be running Cyberpunk 2077 at the highest settings. Finding the proper processors, storage, memory, cooling, and other hardware and ensuring all the components work well together can make or break the rig. Luckily, many manufacturers take care of a good chunk of that guesswork so you don’t bottleneck the system. Whether you're looking for something more affordable for indie games, want a compact option to save space in your studio apartment, or are after a top-tier rig to tackle the action in 4K, we’ve got you covered. One of the five pre-built gaming PCs we’ve selected will align perfectly with your needs.Contributions by Danielle Abraham and Georgie PeruLooking for additional savings? Check out the best gaming PC deals happening right now. The State of Gaming PCs in 2025Right now, we're in the middle of the next generation of PC hardware launching. Nvidia and AMD have released their respective new graphics cards, and we're still hot on the heels of the AMD Ryzen 9950X3D and 9800X3D. While we haven't had the chance to review any prebuilt gaming PCs with the new hardware – yet, at least – there are a couple things to keep in mind. Most gaming PCs on this list have since been updated to support the new graphics cards, and even if they weren't, that doesn't mean they're not worth buying anymore. Because while the RTX 5080 is an extremely powerful graphics card, it's really just a few percentage points ahead of the RTX 4080 Super. So, if you can catch a deal on an RTX 4080 Super gaming PC, you should jump on it – all you're missing out on is multi-frame generation and an extra 10fps in some games. Gaming PCs also remain one of the best ways to get your hands on one of the new graphics cards, too. PC manufacturers usually pay bulk prices for graphics cards, so you can usually get a full system for just a bit more than the standalone graphics card costs right now. While this sucks for anyone who just wants to upgrade their PC with a new GPU, its actually great for people who don't already have a PC to slot a graphics card into. Lenovo Legion Tower 7i – Photos1. Lenovo Legion Tower 7iBest Gaming PCLenovo Legion Tower 7iThe Lenovo Legion Tower 7i is packed with extremely powerful hardware, and is easy to open up and upgrade.GPUNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti – RTX 4080 SuperRAMUp to 32GB DDR5 @ 4,000MHzStorageUp to 2TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDSize19.37 x 8.31 x 18.27 inches (H x W x D)Extremely solid performance for the moneyShips with very basic memory and motherboardPrebuilt gaming PCs have always had a problem with proprietary hardware, and the Lenovo Legion Tower 7i really does show we're through those dark ages. It used to be that if you bought a gaming PC from Lenovo or Dell, you'd get a tower that was plenty powerful for the time, but because it was using some bespoke motherboard or power supply, you were limited when it came to upgrading your system. When I reviewed the Lenovo Legion Tower 7i though, I was blown away by how much it's just a normal gaming PC. You get a straightforward mid-tower case housing industry-standard hardware, making it incredibly easy to fix it if something breaks or upgrade once new hardware comes out. Don't get me wrong: The Tower 7i does fall into some of the same pitfalls of any prebuilt system these days – Lenovo cheaped out a bit on the memory and the motherboard – but because all the components are the standard size, you can just swap both of those components out for better stuff when you can afford it. This results in a gaming PC that's not just great because it plays games well, but because it serves as an entry point to customizing your own system. Building an entire system from the ground up can be an intimidating and time-consuming thing; upgrading one or two parts of your PC is way more approachable. There are dozens of prebuilt gaming PCs out there that now serve as great entry points to building your own rig. What sets the Lenovo Legion Tower 7i apart is its price. This high-end tower is significantly cheaper than similarly specced systems from HP or Alienware, even if it's not quite as flashy. But if all you want is a solid gaming experience, the Lenovo Legion Tower 7i is the prebuilt to get right now. 2. HP Omen 45LBest Current-Gen PCHP Omen 45LBreeze through every task and game thanks to an Intel Core i9 CPU, Nividia RTX 4090 GPU, and 16GB RAM that a robust cooling system helps keep frosty.CPUIntel Core i7-14700K – Intel Core i9-14900KGPUNvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti – RTX 4090Storage512GB – 2TB SSD (System); 1TB – 2TB 7200 rpm hard disk (Secondary)Size8.03 x 18.5 x 21.85 inches (W x D x H)One of the best cases in a pre-built gaming PCsIt is VERY heavy. Team lifting definitely recommended.For the longest time, the best gaming PCs were cursed with weird proprietary cases that required bespoke motherboards and power supplies that were nearly impossible to replace. HP used to be one of the biggest offenders here, but recently, its Omen gaming PCs have drastically changed how it makes its gaming towers. The HP Omen 45L isn't just one of my favorite gaming PCs; I've even built a complete custom PC in its case, and that's not something I'd dream to attempt in most prebuilt gaming PC chassis. It's a spacious gaming rig with a ton of room for upgrades, able to support custom water cooling loops and giant graphics cards like the RTX 4090 without even beginning to worry about it bumping into anything important. This makes the HP Omen 45L a gaming PC that I'd recommend buying the entry-level model of, even if it comes with a paltry 512GB SSD and an RTX 4060 Ti. This is one of the easiest prebuilts to tinker with, and upgrading to a bigger SSD and a more beefy graphics card later down the line when you can afford it is going to be a breeze. That being said, this is a premium gaming PC with a premium price, starting at $2,060 before discounts. (Trust me, there are always discounts.) That price nets you an Intel Core i7-14700K, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of SSD storage, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. That config isn't bad, easily able to power through pretty much any AAA PC game without breaking a sweat, but you can get a comparable HP Victus build for $1,369, albeit with a much worse chassis and limited to the non-Ti RTX 4060. It's a high sticker price, but it's absolutely worth it if you want a PC case that isn't complete trash. You'll be using the same case for years, building up war stories from upgrading your rig like any PC gamer that's built their own PC. My own PC case is a Cooler Master HAF 500P Mesh, and I've been maintaining and upgrading that PC for more than five years now. The HP Omen 45L chassis is one of the only times I've thought about swapping PC cases, and that should tell you something. 3. iBuyPower Trace 7 Mesh Gaming DesktopBest Budget Gaming PCiBuyPower Trace 7 Mesh Gaming DesktopAffordable gaming PC offering processors ready to handle some 1080p gaming and high-bandwidth DDR5 RAM.Size19.3\" x 8.66\" x 18.9\"Ready to run games in 1080p at high frame ratesIncludes mouse and keyboardNot all gaming PCs are either prohibitively expensive or lack power with dated hardware, and the iBuyPower Trace 7 Mesh Gaming Desktop is proof. With it comes the latest 14th-generation Intel Core i7 processor for speedy performance in everyday tasks and games. When paired with the best budget GPU, Nvidia’s RTX 4060, this rig has enough processing headroom to sail through games in 1080p at high frame rates. Looking to play in 1440p? It shouldn’t have a problem cruising through non-ray-traced games like Total War: Warhammer 3. The iBuyPower Trace 7 Mesh Gaming Desktop is even a viable option for those ready to dip their toes in game streaming, as its current-gen processors partner perfectly with the 32GB of high-bandwidth DDR5 RAM. So, running Twitch along with a game shouldn’t slow things down too much. Storage wasn't overlooked: A 1TB SSD is baked in for speedy app launches and saves.Even if this gaming PC isn’t as powerful as some premium options, it still gets hot. Luckily, the case is roomy with mesh at the front and top panels for proper airflow and ventilation. Three ARGB fans at the front and one at the back aid in keeping things frosty. However, better cooling options couldn't hurt. Luckily, iBuyPower has made things relatively easy to upgrade. With Nvidia’s RTX 5000 series and 15th-gen Intel Arrow Lake processors dropping sometime in the not-too-distant future, it’s nice to have the option to update hardware rather than starting from scratch. Just be sure the B760 D5 motherboard and 600W PSU can handle those newer components. Given all that's on offer for less than $1,500, the iBuyPower Trace 7 Mesh Gaming Desktop is a great value. What helps elevate this budget gaming PC even further is the inclusion of a gaming keyboard and mouse with some flashy RGB lighting. These aren’t the best peripherals out there, but perfect for those just beginning their gaming journey. Asus ROG NUC – Photos4. Asus ROG NUCBest Mini Gaming PCAsus ROG NUCThe Asus ROG NUC is about as mini as a mini gaming PC can get. Plus its surprisingly strapped with a mobile-class RTX 4070.CPU Intel Core Ultra 7 – Intel Core Ultra 9GPU Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 – Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 (Mobile)Storage512GB – 1TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDSize10.62 x 7.09 x 2.36 inches (W x D x H)The same size as a cable boxSolid 1080p gaming performanceUses mobile-class hardwareShopping for a mini gaming PC is an exercise in compromise. You can get an extremely small gaming PC like the Asus ROG NUC, but in order for the chassis to get down to that size, there are major losses in performance. Asus handles this by equipping the ROG NUC with a mobile-class RTX 4070 and an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor, the latter of which is typically found in Ultrabooks. This is more than enough horsepower to power most games at 1080p, but you will run into issues at higher resolutions, especially in demanding games like Black Myth: Wukong. I went into reviewing the Asus ROG NUC with this in mind, and I was pleasantly surprised at how well it handled games at 1080p. At that resolution, I was able to run pretty much any game under the sun at maxed-out settings while maintaining 60fps. That's impressive, given that the PC is basically the size of a cable box and can fit pretty much anywhere. This makes it an excellent home theater PC that can also play PC games. And if you're comfortable tweaking game graphics settings, this mini gaming PC would make a perfect companion for a 4K TV. You can store your media library there and have instant access to your movies and TV shows, while also being able to boot up Steam and play your games when you want to. Just keep in mind that you can likely get similar performance from a gaming laptop most of the time. How to Choose a Gaming PCPrebuilts are the most surefire way of getting into gaming and arguably the most cost-effective hardware you can buy. With a system, you’re not only getting the hardware inside, but time savings of having to track down the best processor to best RAM for your system and putting it all together yourself and praying it actually boots up correctly.That said, just like building your own PC you want to make sure you’re spending your money where it’s needed most. Firstly, you should prioritize getting the graphics card you need for the gaming monitor or the gaming TV you’re gaming on. There’s no need for anything better than an Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti if you’re just playing games on a 1080p display.Likewise, you should only need an Intel Core i5 or Ryzen 5 processor with at least four cores to play most modern games comfortably at any resolution.System memory and solid-state drives can be the biggest money sink for any system. Those comfortable with upgrading their system after it arrives should choose a configuration with the smallest storage and RAM capacities possible, as buying these components yourself can often be more cost-effective.If that last suggestion resonates, perhaps a barebones system is what you seek. Those can be much cheaper since they come with all the major hardware – such as the CPU, GPU, and power supply – installed, but they usually lack storage, memory, and an operating system as a trade-off.Lastly, if you want more control over what exactly is going into your build, go with a boutique PC builder. Origin, Maingear, DigitalStorm, Falcon Northwest, PC Specialist, and many more companies offer excellent PC building services that let you pick exactly which components go into your gaming PC. From there, they build your system with the sort of cable management some can only dream of while ensuring it all works properly out of the box.In case this all sounds a little overwhelming to you, NZXT has its own PC building service called BLD. Instead of picking every part that will go into your PC, you chose the games you’ll actually play and the service gives you several configuration options that will be able to run the games for a smooth experience.Similarly, iBuyPower offers an Easy Builder service that operates in very much the same fashion. Users can select games that they play from a small pool that includes Fortnite, GTA V, Apex Legends, WoW, League of Legends, Overwatch, and Battlefield V. From there, users can select whether they play at a 1080p or 1440p resolution, as well as their budget, and the system will spit back a few configurations to choose from.Prebuilt PCs also come with several features and pieces of software you might find convenient. Many gaming PCs in this category come with some sort of overclocking support and even a one-click button to boost your system's performance. Of course, it's easy enough to download a piece of overclocking software like MSI Afterburner or EVGA Precision X. Additionally, your machine may come with system monitoring software that makes downloading and updating drivers a breeze.Gaming PC FAQShould you buy a gaming PC or a gaming laptop? Unless you’re looking for an all-in-one portable package, a gaming PC is usually better than even the best gaming laptops. With a desktop, it’s much easier and less expensive to upgrade parts, and they tend to last longer before going obsolete. For more on gaming PCs vs. gaming laptops, check out our guide. Is it easy to upgrade your prebuilt gaming PC?It depends. Most PC manufacturers have figured out users absolutely hate proprietary parts. While you might still find no-name motherboards installed into the heart of your PC, they should all at least fall in line with the standard size and layout of Mini ITX or Micro ATX motherboards. The best gaming PCs should allow you to easily swap out the CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage on your system with just a few simple tools or just a screwdriver.Better yet, systems that tout tool-less upgradability don't require you to undo screws or anything to replace any of the major components. One of the things you'll likely find on most modern chassis are thumbscrews, which can be removed after a few quick twists with your fingers rather than a screwdriver. Additionally, tool-less SSD and hard drive caddies make expanding and replacing your storage just a little bit easier.Should you buy a gaming PC or a console?When comparing a gaming PC vs. console, there appear to be more similarities than differences these days, but one still comes out on top: the gaming PC.Not every aspect of a gaming PC beats consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Consoles are much easier to use. You’ll also find that even the most expensive consoles are cheap compared to a quality gaming PC with a good graphics card, although there are good budget GPUs. There are some great handheld gaming PCs and mini PCs that are more affordable, but they’re better for indie games or older cross-platform console titles.Where a gaming PC pulls ahead is in its gaming library, peripherals, upgradeability, and overall performance. There’s no denying that there are a massive amount of PC games, and of course, a gaming PC has cross-platform compatibility with popular console titles. Beyond gaming keyboards and gaming mice, you’ll find a wealth of other peripherals, from racing wheels to controllers, that all work seamlessly with a PC. You can also enjoy better visuals and a higher performance ceiling, and it’s easy to upgrade components. That makes a well-equipped PC the clear winner.Can you find a good gaming PC for under $1,000?Yes, it’s absolutely possible to find a great gaming PC for under $1,000. You just need to manage your expectations. Less powerful hardware will usually come in these ultra budget-friendly desktops, meaning gaming performance is more limited. Even still, you should have no problem running many of your favorite games in 1080p or sometimes even 1440p at respectable frame rates. Your PC may struggle during more graphically intensive games running at their top settings, but the savings you enjoy might be worth the trade-off. Should you build your own gaming PC?Building your own gaming PC has many benefits. First and foremost, you get to customize your PC to your own specifications, including only the components you want and need. Rather than purchasing a prebuilt desktop that may not be tailored to your requirements, you can select all of the individual parts that make up a gaming PC.However, you will need some knowledge of how to build PCs, or at least be able to closely follow an in-depth YouTube video. This is where things get a little tricky. If you’ve never built a custom gaming PC before, you will need to do some research. From understanding how each component interacts with each other, to how to hold a stick of RAM or a CPU so you don’t damage it, there’s quite a large learning curve.If you do decide to build your own gaming PC, you will likely find that you can save some money over the long run compared to buying a prebuilt machine. Choosing your own parts means you can keep an eye on sales and offers to get the best deal possible. But building a gaming PC isn’t for everyone. If you aren’t rigid on the specifics and don’t have a particular build in mind, it can be less troublesome to let someone else do it for you. You also get the added reassurance that the PC will be professionally built, and there’s no chance your warranty can be void.After you've scored an awesome gaming PC, be sure to grab the best gaming accessories for the ultimate PC battle station.

That\u0026#39;s impressive, given that the PC is basically the size of a cable box and can fit pretty much anywhere. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThis makes it an excellent home theater PC that can also play PC games. And if you\u0026#39;re comfortable tweaking game graphics settings, this mini gaming PC would make a perfect companion for a 4K TV. You can store your media library there and have instant access to your movies and TV shows, while also being able to boot up Steam and play your games when you want to.

With a system, you’re not only getting the hardware inside, but time savings of having to track down the \u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-cpus-for-gaming\"\u003ebest processor\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ram-kits\"\u003ebest RAM\u003c/a\u003e for your system and putting it all together yourself and praying it actually boots up correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThat said, just like building your own PC you want to make sure you’re spending your money where it’s needed most. Firstly, you should prioritize getting the \u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-graphics-card\"\u003egraphics card\u003c/a\u003e you need for the \u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/06/the-best-gaming-monitors-2\"\u003egaming monitor\u003c/a\u003e or the \u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-4k-tvs-for-gaming\"\u003egaming TV\u003c/a\u003e you’re gaming on. There’s no need for anything better than an Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti if you’re just playing games on a 1080p display.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eLikewise, you should only need an Intel Core i5 or Ryzen 5 processor with at least four cores to play most modern games comfortably at any resolution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eSystem memory and \u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssd\"\u003esolid-state drives\u003c/a\u003e can be the biggest money sink for any system. Those comfortable with upgrading their system after it arrives should choose a configuration with the smallest storage and RAM capacities possible, as buying these components yourself can often be more cost-effective.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eIf that last suggestion resonates, perhaps a barebones system is what you seek. Those can be much cheaper since they come with all the major hardware – such as the CPU, GPU, and \u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-power-supplies-for-your-gaming-pc\"\u003epower supply\u003c/a\u003e – installed, but they usually lack storage, memory, and an operating system as a trade-off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eLastly, if you want more control over what exactly is going into your build, go with a boutique PC builder. Origin, Maingear, DigitalStorm, Falcon Northwest, PC Specialist, and many more companies offer excellent PC building services that let you pick exactly which components go into your gaming PC. From there, they build your system with the sort of cable management some can only dream of while ensuring it all works properly out of the box.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eIn case this all sounds a little overwhelming to you, \u003ca href=\"https://www.letsbld.com/\" data-cy=\"styled-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eNZXT has its own PC building service called BLD\u003c/a\u003e.

Users can select games that they play from a small pool that includes Fortnite, GTA V, Apex Legends, WoW, League of Legends, Overwatch, and Battlefield V. From there, users can select whether they play at a 1080p or 1440p resolution, as well as their budget, and the system will spit back a few configurations to choose from.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003ePrebuilt PCs also come with several features and pieces of software you might find convenient.

Most PC manufacturers have figured out users absolutely hate proprietary parts.

One of the things you\u0026#39;ll likely find on most modern chassis are thumbscrews, which can be removed after a few quick twists with your fingers rather than a screwdriver. Additionally, tool-less SSD and hard drive caddies make expanding and replacing your storage just a little bit easier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 data-cy=\"title3\"\u003eShould you buy a gaming PC or a console?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eWhen comparing a \u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/gaming-pc-vs-console-differences\"\u003e\u003cu\u003egaming PC vs. console\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, there appear to be more similarities than differences these days, but one still comes out on top: the gaming PC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eNot every aspect of a gaming PC beats consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Consoles are much easier to use. You’ll also find that even the most expensive consoles are cheap compared to a quality gaming PC with a good graphics card, although there are \u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-budget-gpus\"\u003egood budget GPUs\u003c/a\u003e.

There’s no denying that there are a massive amount of PC games, and of course, a gaming PC has cross-platform compatibility with popular console titles.

You just need to manage your expectations. Less powerful hardware will usually come in these ultra budget-friendly desktops, meaning gaming performance is more limited. Even still, you should have no problem running many of your favorite games in 1080p or sometimes even 1440p at respectable frame rates. Your PC may struggle during more graphically intensive games running at their top settings, but the savings you enjoy might be worth the trade-off. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 data-cy=\"title3\"\u003eShould you build your own gaming PC?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eBuilding your own gaming PC has many benefits. First and foremost, you get to customize your PC to your own specifications, including only the components you want and need. Rather than purchasing a prebuilt desktop that may not be tailored to your requirements, you can select all of the individual parts that make up a gaming PC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eHowever, you will need some knowledge of how to build PCs, or at least be able to closely follow an in-depth YouTube video. This is where things get a little tricky. If you’ve never built a custom gaming PC before, you will need to do some research. From understanding how each component interacts with each other, to how to hold a stick of RAM or a CPU so you don’t damage it, there’s quite a large learning curve.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eIf you do decide to build your own gaming PC, you will likely find that you can save some money over the long run compared to buying a prebuilt machine. Choosing your own parts means you can keep an eye on sales and offers to get the best deal possible. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eBut building a gaming PC isn’t for everyone. If you aren’t rigid on the specifics and don’t have a particular build in mind, it can be less troublesome to let someone else do it for you. You also get the added reassurance that the PC will be professionally built, and there’s no chance your warranty can be void.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eAfter you\u0026#39;ve scored an awesome gaming PC, be sure to grab the \u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-accessories\"\u003ebest gaming accessories\u003c/a\u003e for the ultimate PC battle station. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eJacqueline Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN.
