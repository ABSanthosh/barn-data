In addition to the discounted Meta Quest 3 or excellent Switch Cyber Monday sales, maybe you want to grab something more practical like a robot vacuum. Cleaning isn’t as exciting as escaping to alternate universes, but it’s something you have to do. Luckily, robot vacuums take the dirty work out of vacuuming (and sometimes mopping) your floors, letting you get back to things you actually enjoy. Aside from Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the best times of the year to buy a robot vacuum. Chances are good you won’t see deeper savings than those that are happening right now. That’s why I’m here to round up the best robot vacuum deals from excellent brands like Shark, Roborock, Eufy, Ecovacs, iRobot, and more. It’s a pain to scour the internet for deals, so I found eight great ones worth checking out. I test vacuums for a living, so I’ve had hands-on experience with all of the top robot vacuum brands, including many of the discounted models below. Whether you’re after something budget-friendly or a souped-up option, I’m confident that my picks will keep your floors clean with virtually little to no effort on your part. Who doesn’t want that? Best Cyber Monday Robot Vacuum Deals by BrandTo make life a little easier, I’ve organized the best Cyber Monday robot vacuum deals by brand. From basic options that just efficiently and effectively vacuum your floors to ones that take things up a notch by offering mopping, powerful suction, and self-cleaning base stations, I’ve got you covered. Prices and a few details on each robot are listed, so you don’t need to waste your time on robots that are over budget or don’t suit your individual needs. Here are the eight best Cyber Monday robot vacuum deals: Shark Robot Vacuum DealsThe Shark brand has been around for a long time now, and there’s a good reason for that: It continues to make top-notch home products for a mid-range price. It’s hard not to fall for this trustworthy brand’s sleek and powerful robot vacuums that are seeing major discounts at the moment. Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch Robot Vacuum and MopThis combo mopping and vacuuming robot packs a whole lot of functionality into its compact base, and it's on sale for $549.99 on Cyber Monday. I recently tested the Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch Robot Vacuum and Mop, which is currently $250 off. I’m happy to report it keeps up with Shark’s winning reputation, as it vacuumed, mopped, and navigated my space with ease. I especially loved the surprisingly compact base station that empties the robot’s dust box, fills the water reservoir, and even dries the mop. It’s absolutely perfect for those with apartments or smaller homes. Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum \u0026 MopMopping, vacuuming, and self-emptying base station for $400 offWant something with similar functionality to the Shark PowerDetect for a little less? The Shark Matrix 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop is on sale for $349 and does almost everything that vacuum does. You just don’t get as much functionality on the base station. Still, it comes with LiDAR Navigation, sonic mopping, edge cleaning, and more. Eufy Robot Vacuum DealsEufy isn’t as well-known of a brand as Shark or iRobot but makes high-quality, long-lasting robot vacuums packing tons of technology for an excellent whole home clean. You really can’t go wrong with any of its vacuums. Eufy x10 Pro Omni Robot Vacuum and MopGrab this highly capable 2-in-1 robot vacuum and base station at a steep discount on Cyber Monday. With a self-cleaning, self-emptying, and self-filling base station, the Eufy x10 Pro Omni Robot Vacuum and Mop will rarely require you to intervene. Plus, the 8,000 Pa suction power, excellent obstacle avoidance, and effective oscillating mops make for a deep clean. All of that for just $549.99 is hard to complain about.Eufy X8 HybridAn ultra-cheap robot vacuum packing a surprising amount of functionality. The Eufy X8 Hybrid is a more barebones robot vacuum. Sure, suction power and navigation won’t be as great as the X10 Pro Omni, and forget about a base station, but for only $150, it's ideal for anyone with lighter cleaning needs. The fact that mopping is still included for that price is shocking. iRobot Roomba DealsRoombas are the robot vacs that started the craze, and these devices have come a long way from their early days of bumping into every obstacle in their path. These are some of the best vacuums around, offering great suction, excellent navigation, and a whole wealth of features to get your floors clean. Now is the time to buy, as iRobot has some of the best deals out there.iRobot Roomba j7+The iRobot Roomba j7+ features a self-emptying base station and is on sale for just $359 at Best Buy or for only $229 refurbished at Walmart. The iRobot Roomba j7+ is known for having some top-tier navigation, so if you’ve got a slightly more cluttered home, this could be the vacuum for you. It also features a three-stage cleaning system that packs in power-lifting suction perfect for picking up pet hair, and the auto-emptying base station means you rarely need to deal with cleaning out the dust box. All of this for $359 is a steal. Walmart is even selling a refurbished model for $229 for even greater savings. iRobot Roomba Vac Robot Vacuum (Q0120)The best starter robot vacuum is on sale for $149 on Cyber MondayPowerful suction and navigation come with the iRobot Roomba Vac Robot Vacuum (Q0120) for only $150 – that’s $100 in savings. Now, it’s a more basic vacuum with very limited functionality, but for those just dipping their toes in the robot vac world, it’s the perfect starter option before investing in something with more functionality. Roborock Robot Vacuum DealsOut of all the robot vacuum brands I’ve tested, Roborock products tend to be my favorite. You may not heard of this brand before, but it’s actually one of the top-selling robot vacuum manufacturers in the world. And this year’s Roborock Cyber Monday sales are pretty impressive. These are my two favorites: Roborock S8 Max Ultra Robot Vacuum and MopSave $600 on this combo robot vacuum offering smart dirt detection, mopping, and a self-cleaning base stationSmart Dirt Detection, high-powered suction, and Edge Mopping System make for spotless floors when using the Roborock S8 Max Ultra Robot Vacuum and Mop. The robot vacuum’s cleaning precision is second to none, and the base is equally great with hot mop washing and drying. Right now, you can grab it for $600 less than its retail price. Sure, it is still pretty expensive, but it’s one of the most capable 2-in-1 robot vacuums you can buy. Roborock Q RevoGet the Roborock excellence for less with the Q Revo. Roborock products tend to be higher priced than many other brands but are often worth the splurge. However, you can snag the Roborock Q Revo for only $540 and still enjoy features like a fully automatic base station, dual spinning mops, 5500 Pa suction, and next-level obstacle avoidance. Other Cyber Monday Robot Vacuum DealsEcovacs DEEBOT T30SThis $600 Cyber Monday deal is one of the best values out there. Another lesser-known brand that makes high-quality, fully-featured robot vacuums is Ecovacs. No matter what you’re after, chances are good Ecovacs has a robot vacuum model to suit your needs. I even tested a model that includes a hand vacuum on the self-emptying base. Right now, many of its products are discounted more than usual, including the Ecovacs Deebot T30S with its 11000 Pa suction, making it one of the most powerful robot vacuums available. That means almost all your messes on both hard floors and carpets should be picked up with ease. Mopping and the feature-rich base station add even more value to this $599 robot vac.Narwal Freo X Ultra Robot Vacuum and Mop ComboThe Narwal Freo X Ultra has a 43% discount for Cyber Monday. It differentiates itself from others by offering a handy little touch screen on the base station, making you less reliant on an app. Narwal is a newer robot vacuum brand, and I had the opportunity to test one of its vacuums last year. Below is a newer model of that vacuum, and it comes with all the classic high-end features like vacuuming, mopping, and self-cleaning base. However, it differentiates itself from other vacuums I’ve tested thanks to a handy touchscreen on the base, making you less reliant on app control. Originally posted: Dec 3, 2024 12:00 am",
