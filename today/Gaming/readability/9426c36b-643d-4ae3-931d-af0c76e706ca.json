In Project Viltrumites, a fun new game inspired by Invincible, you can play as all the famous comic book Characters. Each one brings their own style that is reminiscent of their counterparts in the comic books and the cartoon, making the game feel different every time you turn it on. The Characters are easy to start, but hard to master, so follow along with our Project Viltrumites Character tier list and guide to start destroying your opponents. Project Viltrumites Character Tier List Image via Tiermaker There are not too many Characters introduced in Project Viltrumites yet, but from the ones that were added, they are quite good. Each of them have a unique use and playstyle, and are fun in their unique way. I recommend starting off with Mark, as he is easy and does a lot of damage. The game will be fully released soon, so you should bookmark this page to stay up to date with the latest releases and Character rankings. Project Viltrumites Characters List If you are just starting Project Viltrumites, I would recommend going for Mark, as he is easy and does a lot of damage. When you are ready to take off your training shoes, try playing Electricity Guy. He is fun and can attack multiple people at once with his ranged abilities. Big Brain is a pay-to-win Character that is very strong. But he costs money for now, so I do not recommend that you buy him, as he will probably become free when the game releases. How to change Characters in Project Viltrumites It’s that easy! To change your Character in Project Viltrumites, all you have to do is navigate to the top left side of your screen. You will find the Characters button right next to the Options and Chat buttons. It is pretty big, so once you know it’s there, you can’t miss it. Once you’re ready, select the Character you would like to play and enjoy! That is all for my Project Viltrumites Characters tier list.
