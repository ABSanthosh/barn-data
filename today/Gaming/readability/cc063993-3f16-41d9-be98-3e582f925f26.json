We are excited to share the latest trailer, as well as additional information on the second open beta test (OBT2).  First, let’s unpack all the reveals from the latest trailer. Meet a wandering Wudwud at the newly revealed locale: the Iceshard Cliffs The hunter and the Expedition Team arrive at a new locale, the Iceshard Cliffs. As the story unfolds, you’ll venture into this icy landscape and encounter a variety of monsters that reside in it. The Iceshard Cliffs is a locale where snowy blizzards blow. The Iceshard Cliffs is a locale where snowy blizzards blow. Icy fog drifts in the air, forming a unique area where you can see collapsed debris and something fluttering in the freezing winds overhead. Hunters exploring during a blizzard. Beat the cold and stay in top condition by warming up with a hot drink. The Iceshard Cliffs are home to endemic life that have adapted to its harsh conditions for survival. An ordinary Wudwud who has wandered far from home Rove Rove, the quirky Wudwud you will meet in the Iceshard Cliffs. Monsters inhabiting the Iceshard Cliffs Hirabami – Leviathan A species of leviathan that inhabits the Iceshard Cliffs. It has sharp claws on its tail and uses a wind-catching membrane on its neck that allows it to float. In our latest trailer, a mysterious large monster is seen attacking a group of Hirabami. Nerscylla – Temnoceran Nerscylla, a Temnoceran, makes its comeback to the Monster Hunter series. It defeats its prey with a single blow from its distinctive horn. It appears that Nerscylla is trying to restrain and prey on Gypceros… During the final scene of the trailer, the ominous Gore Magala launches a surprise attack on Fabius and members of the Expedition Team.  What kind of threat will the fearsome Gore Magala pose in Monster Hunter Wilds? Face off with fan-favorite monster in the full game and find out for yourself! Unfold the story of Arkveld, the White Wraith In the latest trailer, more of the mysterious nature of the flagship monster, Arkveld, is revealed. Uncover its true nature and the motives behind its actions as you make your way through the rich and compelling story of Monster Hunter Wilds.  What is the true nature of Arkveld, which skillfully attacks with its unique chain-like appendages extending from its wings? A battle between Arkveld and Rey Dau, the apex predator of the Windward Plains. The flagship monster Arkveld appears in the second open beta test (OBT2)  The second open beta test will be held during the following two sessions below.  Date and time (Pacific Time)Thursday, February 6th 2025 7:00pm – Sunday, February 9th, 2025 6:59 pmThursday, February 13th, 2025 7:00 pm – Sunday, February 16th, 2025 6:59 pm Pre-load for the second Open Beta Test begins on February 5, 2025 (Wednesday) at 7:00pm. Both sessions will feature identical content, so we hope you join the hunt when you can! OBT2 includes the same content as the OBT held last November: Character Creation, Story Trial, and a Doshagma Hunt.  After slaying Doshaguma, hunters can continue to enjoy other hunts that await you in the Windward Plains. In OBT2, hunters can face off against Gypceros: a poisonous Bird Wyvern that is well-known in the series for its intelligent and unique behavior. We hope you enjoy taking on this returning monster in OBT2! OBT2 marks your first chance to take on Arkveld, the flagship monster of Monster Hunter Wilds. Arkveld appears in a more difficult advanced quest specially tweaked for OBT2. We encourage skilled and confident hunters to take on this difficult challenge. The Training Area is now available in OBT2, and can be accessed from the base camp. Hone your skills with various weapons as you get ready for the hunts ahead.  Keep in mind that OBT2 does not reflect the full slate of adjustments and tweaks to weapon actions and balancing, that will be featured in the full release of the game. In OBT2, hunters can create a Private Lobby that cannot be found through searching, perfect for when you hunt with a specific small group. In addition, Online Single Player mode is also available, allowing you to play solo without joining a lobby. While in this mode, you can also temporarily play multiplayer by using an SOS Flare. Whether you were unable to join the first OBT, or are looking to take on the additional monsters added, we hope you enjoy OBT2!  OBT2 is available to all players with a PS5 and a PlayStation Network account, regardless of whether you have a subscription to PlayStation Plus.  All who play OBT2 will receive a Felyne pendant to decorate your weapon or Seikret, as well as a Bonus Item pack in the full game. If you’ve already played the first Open Beta Test, you’re already set to receive these rewards at launch.  For PlayStation 5 Pro players, be aware that while OBT2 is playable on PS5 Pro, it is not officially supported with PS5 Pro Enhanced features. The full version of Monster Hunter Wilds will support PS5 Pro via a day 1 patch.  Carry over your created characters from both Open Beta Tests to the full version of Monster Hunter Wilds! Note however that some character edit recipe values will have slight differences in the full version. Monster Hunter Wilds is nearly here! Thank you to all our hunters for your support. We can’t wait to see you in the Forbidden Lands when the game launches on February 28. Pre-loading the game If you’ve pre-ordered Monster Hunter Wilds at PlayStation Store, you’ll be able to pre-load the game 48 hours ahead of release, ensuring you can spend less time downloading and more time hunting!
