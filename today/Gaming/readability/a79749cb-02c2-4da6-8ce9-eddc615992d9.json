  "text": "Kity Builder needs some construction-savvy felines to head to a deserted island to build up a city for future furry denizens. You’ve been tasked with coming to an island and building a town for a Mayor who wants people to move to the island. At the moment, the place has nowhere for other cats to stay or even play, so it’s not a very attractive spot to call home. You’ll find that you’ve lost all of the blueprints that you need to build things as soon as you land on the island. Despite your boss being quite mad at you and you just being a little guy, you get right to work, getting familiar with the place and gathering up these prints so you can build a cool town. There aren’t many requirements when it comes to building a town, and in the demo I played at Indie Dev Day, you didn’t even need to gather resources. Instead, Kity Builder relies on freeform building, funny dialogue, and silly moments. The Mayor needs you for all sorts of tasks while he sits on top of a hill and calls himself the best Mayor out there. The cat villagers who come to town cannot even go inside your teeny tinyl houses, so they just sit on top of them, looking out at the world you built. There is something just absolutely charming about Kity Builder, that just makes you want to continue building until you hear the next silly thing that will happen or be said to you. There isn’t a timer, any sort of goal, or even places that need specific items. Instead, you can explore at your own pace, build whatever you want, or just chill out with the other cats. It’s meant to be a relaxing experience and one where there is no wrong way to build, which makes Kity Builder feel pretty wholesome and cozy. Kity Builder is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
