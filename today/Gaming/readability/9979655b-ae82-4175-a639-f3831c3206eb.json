Lord of the Rings Online Okay, maybe the top spot for that goes to EVE Online, but LOTRO is in the running, in my heart at least. And I will certainly acknowledge that I have spent the last few years doing little besides complaining about the game, picking at the bits of it that annoy me.  But I do that because those are often the items that stand between me and enjoying the game. My last foray into SSG’s vision of Middle-earth was fraught the usual issues, the slow and comically out of date launcher, the server lag, the lack of support for wide-screen monitors, the quirkiness of the UI when you try to resize something, only to find you can’t or that the setting doesn’t stick between sessions or that they are still using bitmaps of their awful skill icons that actually get worse as you try to scale them up… and there is no was to share settings between characters, so you have to hunt down all the settings all over again. Oh, and legendary items, the needy baby mechanic where you constantly have to go back to base mid-adventure in order to level up your sword or bow.  I really feel like Aragorn or Boromir in Moria when I have to turn around and find that NPC who will make my weapon 1% better because I don’t reforge it now it stops gaining progress. So yeah, I have complaints.  But I also have a strong desire to play because despite those issue because I am absolutely draw to the charm and even some of the quirkiness of the game.  I even considered going back to my old 1920×1200 monitor in order to play… except that I am now so used to 3440×1440 and being able to have multiple windows available for other projects that it would be a touch change. Which brings me to the current moment and the launch of the new 64-bit servers and the promise, as yet unproven, that things will be at least somewhat better, that a cascade of new players will be showing up, and that it might just be the right time to jump back into things. This is for all practical purposes a fresh server launch… and all the more so with the current transfer situation… and a launch onto a well populated server at that.  So I am headed to the Glamdring server for some 64-bit goodness. Because a part of me wants to get at least get to Mordor.  I have been playing LOTRO off and on since late beta and I have never gotten beyond the gloom of Mirkwood. Since transfers to the new servers don’t seem to be a thing yet, unless you log in at exactly the right moment when they are enabled and haven’t yet overwhelmed the system, I am back to considering a start from scratch.  I mean, I have actually SEEN the transfer button a few times… but most times it is like the goggles, in that it does nothing. LOTRO transfer, hourglass of doom Well, once it brought up the Treebeard server, where I rolled a character I never played.  Not sure it is worthwhile to transfer a level 1. Treebeard? AYFKM? That is fine.  I can start from scratch  I actually enjoy the first 50 levels a lot.  I must, given how many times I have done it.  I know the Lone Lands better than Aragorn. I am more well known in Bree than Barliman Butterbar.  I’ve been into the old Forest so many times Tom Bombadil averts his eyes and pretends to be busy with something else when he sees me coming. Also, it helps to learn/re-learn a class from scratch again, especially if there have been changes… and there are always changes.  And the level boost in LOTRO are pretty much a cash shop trap, where they boost you up and leave you unable to managed at level content unless you buy a bunch of additional boosts. The question now is which class should I go with to maximize my ability to solo my way through to Mordor? I am spit three was: The Champion – A pretty handy and raw dual wielding DPS fighter.  Wears heavy armor, can take a punch, and hits hard.  I have always done well with this class in the past, though I haven’t played one in ages so am not sure if SSG has screwed them up. The Hunter – This is the one that comes up if you search the internet on the best class to solo with.  And I do like the hunter.  Ranged attacks are good.  Gets his own speed buff for running.  Only wears medium, so not a class to stand toe to toe with mobs, but good. The Guardian – Maybe the class I have played the most.  Tanky, durable, shouty, and has to be played as a dwarf in my opinion.  Great to have if you want to group, can stand toe to toe with about anything, and did I mention shouty?  Maybe a little slow on the damage though. Those are my safe options, but also ones I have played before.  The ones I have already rolled up. My hunter in a dream sequence… I have so much cosmetic gear handy Maybe it is time for a change?  I am open to suggestions.  The new mariner class, as an example. The rest of my plan is to pick one of those, avoid the trap of alts, which I fall into on every run, and especially avoid the time sink of crafting, which becomes useless down the road so far as I can tell.  Maybe I’ll pick up a the harvesting skills and transfer over my characters from another server.  Or maybe I’ll just avoid crafting altogether. That is my idea, here in 2025, nearly 18 years since the game launched.  I have a lifetime VIP account, I own all the content, I am sitting on a stack of LOTRO coins to unlock any of the cash shop constraints.  Now to see how this plays out.

suggestions.  The new mariner class, as an example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of my plan is to pick one of those, avoid the trap of alts, which I fall into on every run, and especially avoid the time sink of crafting, which becomes useless down the road so far as I can tell.  Maybe I’ll pick up a the harvesting skills and transfer over my characters from another server.  Or maybe I’ll just avoid crafting altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is my idea, here in 2025, nearly 18 years since the game launched.  I have a lifetime VIP account, I own all the content, I am
