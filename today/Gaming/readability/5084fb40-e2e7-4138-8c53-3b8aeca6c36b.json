(I don’t know what I’ll do if Ethic takes that post down some day, I seem to link to it once a year.) So Star Wars: The Old Republic had four pillars, Destiny had seven pillars, and last year Playable Worlds trotted out enough pillars about Stars Reach to outfit the pantheon.  Pillars as a metaphor are fine, even if they can get a bit messianic and they don’t always tell you what is really in store. With that said, is there a more adept metaphor than pillars to frame the housing plans for World of Warcraft. Happy little Hallmark store cup not included Last week Blizz posted a look into their housing plan, a plan first announced back in November, and laid as its foundation a modest three pillars: Boundless Self-Expression: Our highest priority is to allow players to build a house that shows off their own personal tastes or their Warband’s, acts as a desired backdrop for roleplaying, or just allows players to create something in a flight of fancy. The toolset should be easy enough for someone with no 3D experience to be comfortable with and use successfully, but it should also be powerful enough that players can surprise us with their creations or drill down to get the tiniest details just right. The gamut of decor options spans not just the cultures of Azeroth but the many expansions of World of Warcraft as well. Deeply Social: World of Warcraft is more fun with other players, and Housing should be no different. While players can enjoy housing purely on their own, its systems are designed at a fundamental level to encourage interacting, playing, and progressing with friends, neighbors, guilds, and the wider community in a meaningful way. Long-Lasting Journey: Housing is being built as an evergreen addition to the game, with its own roadmap, reaching across multiple patches and into future expansions. Housing isn’t something players should expect to “finish”, but instead continually look forward to the next housing release, be it new content or systems. This is a long-term commitment for us as developers and offers players rewards all along the way. That is a pretty broad canvass and you can pin any number of visions or dreams on it.  I like it, but I am also going to need to see it in action… or at least see a demo.  I have seem some seriously inadequate housing models described in grandiose ways. Elwynn housing sketch… bring your own clutter? Still, that does give me hope that they are on the right path. But for me, the biggest question is how housing will be a part of the world.  This is a divisive issue for many as there are a number of options, from permanent physical lots in the game world to hidden instanced housing with variations in between. Blizzard has decided to go with the instanced neighborhood zone route, which is not my favorite… both EverQuest and Lord of the Rings Online have this and both have the problem of dead neighborhoods… but might be a middle choice for me.  I would prefer the instanced housing that New World has, where the locations are in town and you can see decorations on the front of the most popular house in that instance space.  That, for me, added a bit of charm to the somewhat repetitive medieval of the world and was a step above the EverQuest II housing, which keeps you in town but which has just a generic front door for access. The fact that Blizz is planning two different types of neighborhood is encouraging: Public Neighborhoods, which the game servers are responsible for creating as needed and maintaining. Private Neighborhoods created by groups of friends or guilds to inhabit, progress, and customize together. That you can go in with your pals and make your own neighborhood is a great addition, as the other downside of EQ and LOTRO neighborhoods is that you have to share with the general public who are prone to take the best location, put up one decoration, then abandon the place, never to return.  You’ll at least know who your neglectful neighbors are in this plan. And the neighborhoods plan is still much better than the route of having a real, physical place in the world.  I always hear Star Wars Galaxies fans go on about it having the best housing… and they are absolutely, objectively wrong. Welcome to the Tatooine trailer park vision of housing… never going to stop using this image Yes, I know there was more to that housing than the physical location on the planet, but that imposition of reality, the limitation that prevents people from having housing in a location where they want, is such a downside that it outweighs everything else.   Likewise your Final Fantasy XIV housing, where scarcity means you probably don’t get a home. (And I know Raph Koster is big on this idea for Stars Reach, with his vision assuming that just having many planets and guilds being able to own a planet will keep the location based reality of housing from being a huge problem.  We shall see if planets become “neighborhoods” or if there ends up being a key planet, a Stars Reach Jita, where having a housing in town will be the make or break for your business.) And Blizz goes out of their way to affirm this in their vision of housing in Azeroth: As a part of our focus on wide adoption, we wanted to ensure that Housing is available to everyone. If you want a house, you can have a house. No exorbitant requirements or high purchase costs, no lotteries, and no onerous upkeep (and if your subscription lapses, don’t worry, your house doesn’t get repossessed!). That is most certainly a shot across somebody’s bow. That said, one of the issues of neighborhoods, which Blizz brings up straight away, is that they are zones, and zones are something they are both good at and very particular about.  So when housing arrives… and we still don’t know that date, though it is implied it will be part of the Midnight expansion… it will consist of just two flavors of neighborhood, one for Alliance and one for Horde. The Alliance zone takes inspiration from Elwynn Forest with touches of Westfall and Duskwood, and the Horde’s is inspired by Durotar, its coastline, and Azshara. I guess those are fine places to start, locations where one might reasonably think to have a first home in Azeroth… close to a major city, somewhat protected, familiar terrain. Concept Art of a Durotar neighborhood It is certainly better that putting, say, a Bree housing area on the far side of the Midgewater Marshes.  Talk about your Florida swampland real estate metaphor. All of which is pretty and fine and interesting… I am encouraged by the direction they are going… but still a long way from the nuts and bolts of the actual housing and how it will work.  But we’re also a long way in the year from the little house icon on the updated 2025 World of Warcraft roadmap. Revised 2025 WoW Roadmap – Just for you Shintar The real question, the final question, is what that little house icon means.  The optimists believe that is the date that they will release housing.  Those of us whose optimism has been beaten out of them by a lifetime of disappointment think that is when we’ll get the full reveal about housing, but we won’t get anything until 2026.  We shall see.

Koster is big on this idea for \u003cem\u003eStars Reach\u003c/em\u003e, with his vision assuming that just having many planets and guilds being able to own a planet will keep the location based reality of housing from being a huge problem.  We shall see if planets become “neighborhoods” or if there ends up being a key planet, a \u003cem\u003eStars Reach\u003c/em\u003e Jita, where having a housing in town will be the make or break for your business.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Blizz goes out of their way to affirm this in their vision of housing in Azeroth:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a part of our focus on wide adoption, we wanted to ensure that Housing is available to everyone. If you want a house, you can have a house. No exorbitant requirements or high purchase costs, no lotteries, and no onerous upkeep (and if your subscription lapses, don’t worry, your house doesn’t get repossessed!).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is most certainly a shot across somebody’s bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, one of the issues of neighborhoods, which Blizz brings up straight away, is that they are zones, and zones are something they are both good at and very particular about.  So when housing arrives… and we still don’t know that date, though it is implied it will be part of the \u003cem\u003eMidnight\u003c/em\u003e expansion… it will consist of just two flavors of neighborhood, one for Alliance and one for Horde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Alliance zone takes inspiration from Elwynn Forest with touches of Westfall and Duskwood, and the Horde’s is inspired by Durotar, its coastline, and Azshara.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess those are fine places to start, locations where one might reasonably think to have a first home in Azeroth… close to a major city, somewhat protected, familiar terrain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_132378\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca
