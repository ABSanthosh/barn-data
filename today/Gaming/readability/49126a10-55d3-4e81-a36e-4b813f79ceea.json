  "text": "\"It's time for the team to go back to our cave.\" Image credit: Larian Larian has bid a final farewell to Baldur's Gate 3, its beloved breakout hit that won a legion of fans and propelled the studio to a new level of stardom. Today, as previously announced, marks the release of Patch 8 - the game's final content update. This adds PC, Mac, PlayStation and Xbox crossplay, a photo mode, a dozen more subclasses, plus the long-awaited arrival of Xbox Series S split-screen multiplayer. Larian has marked the patch's launch today in a fresh blog post, which also includes a final animated short featuring the Baldur's Gate 3 cast going on one last adventure. There's even a special fourth wall-breaking cameo from Larian's own head honcho Swen Vincke, dressed in his suit of armour. Baldur’s Gate 3: The Final Patch - An Animated Short Baldur's Gate 3: The Final Patch - An Animated Short.Watch on YouTube \"You've helped us make BG3 a bigger success than any of us could've ever hoped for,\" Larian's blog post reads, \"and that passion could keep us tweaking things and making changes until the end of time. But then we'd never be able to create something new. \"As Swen said during the Baldur's Gate 3 retrospective panel at PAX West in August of last year, it's time for the team to go back to our cave and hang the armour on the wall while we focus on bringing you our next project.\" What is Larian's next project? All we know officially is the game will be unrelated to Dungeons \u0026 Dragons, something \"big and ambitious\" and \"new in the sense that it is different from the things we've done before\". What about a Baldur's Gate 4, then? Well, D\u0026D owner Wizards of the Coast has said we may still get one of those too from another developer, though it wasn't \"in a hurry\" to rush it out.",
