This is the illustrated edition, which includes hand-drawn color illustrations by Tolkien himself, detailed maps of Middle-Earth, deeper lore and world-building, and early histories of key characters throughout the epic saga.

TolkienThe Silmarillion breaks down the early history of its fictional universe Eä and the lands contained within, including Valinor, Beleriand, Númenor, and, of course, Middle-Earth. Broken up into five distinct parts, readers can expect deep lore exposition, extensive historical accounts of the First Age, and summaries of the Third Age stories we know and love, the Lord of the Rings. The Lord of the Rings franchise is no stranger to works in other mediums, like Monolith's game Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor, Magic: The Gathering crossover cards, and Prime Video's live-action series Rings of Power. In IGN's review of Rings of Power season 2, we said \"[season 2] does a great job portraying Sauron’s machinations and his impact on those he manipulates, but too much time is spent on disconnected subplots delivering only mediocre intrigue and thin characters.\"See more book deals at AmazonMyles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.
