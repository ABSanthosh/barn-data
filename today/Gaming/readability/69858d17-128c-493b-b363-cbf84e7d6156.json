He has been writing professionally for over a decade.The second season of Hellbound, the Korean fantasy thriller created by Train to Busan director Yeon Sang-ho, is a little more than two weeks away. And from the looks of the latest trailer, fans of the series are in for an experience just as nightmarish and intense as last season.Released on Wednesday, the trailer for Hellbound season two picks up almost immediately after the first season’s cliffhanger, with seemingly hundreds of people who were previously condemned to hell and murdered by demonic creatures being resurrected without explanation. That alone is cause for concern, before you consider the fact of who was resurrected. That’s right: Jeong Jin-soo (Yoo Ah-in), the founder of the international religious cult known as the New Truth Society and the first season’s antagonist is back, and he’s not looking too hot.It seems as though the Hellbound version of “The Blip” has caused considerable chaos across the world, to say nothing of how it’s impacted The New Truth Society. That’s not even mentioning the return of the smoke demons from the first season, which appear to be wreaking even more havoc in the wake of the mass resurrection. We also get a glimpse of the return of Min Hye-jin (Kim Hyun-joo), the tough-as-nails attorney who exposed the cult’s treachery in the second half of the first season. And this time, she’s got a police baton!Between Jeong Jin-soo’s return, the rise of a new figurehead for the New Truth Society in the form of a mysterious woman known as Park Jungja (Kim Shin-rok), and the reappearance of the demons, the stakes in Hellbound season two are shaping up to be even more fraught than the first.Hellbound season two will premiere on Netflix on Oct. 25.",
