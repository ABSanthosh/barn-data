The announcement comes after the successful release of The Batman and the upcoming conclusion of the HBO Max series The Penguin, which serves as a direct spin-off of the film. Reveas told InterviewMagazine.com, “It’s about cities and their dysfunction and the world and its dysfunction, which is what Batman stories are all about. They’re all about Gotham being a place that should be better.” He continued, “and you can have the experience of this almost novelistic epic crime saga, but you also just get these separate experiences. They have their own dramatic value. So Oz’s story is Oz’s story, and the idea is to do these other stories in the same way.” Related: Agatha All Along Almost Had Surprising Cameo While details about these new projects are currently scarce, Reeves has indicated that he is interested in exploring various characters and storylines within the Gotham City ecosystem. He once mentioned a potential legal drama focusing on Harvey Dent, also known as Two-Face, a character who has played a significant role in Batman’s history. One of the key elements that Reeves hopes to explore in future projects is the opportunity to delve deeper into the complexities and moral ambiguity of Gotham’s criminal underworld. He has acknowledged that the film’s PG-13 rating restricted certain elements of storytelling, and he believes that the freedom of television allows for a more adult-oriented and nuanced portrayal of these characters. There’s a lot more red tape in movies than you’d think, and TV has made leaps and bounds more progression in removing creative limitations. It’d be interesting to see what can be done with the Batman universe. With the success of The Batman and the promising reception of The Penguin, it seems that Reeves may be onto something that doesn’t need to be apart of James Gunn’s DCU. We’ll see if he continues to do well. The Escapist is supported by our audience.
