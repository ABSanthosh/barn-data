The 20th anniversary celebrations are kicking off for World of Warcraft, which is also being joined to the 30th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise as a whole, and Blizz wants you to be able to celebrate the milestone in any number of ways, including handing them nearly a C note for a digital mount… because greed deserves representation too, doesn’t it? I mean, we’re coming up on the 15th anniversary of the Celestial Steed as well, the very first cash shop mount, the original greed steed… if we leave out that Runes of Magic mount from 2009.  Blizz never met an idea they wouldn’t snatch and call their own!  If Runes of Magic failed, it was probably in pricing too low.  Why charge $10 when $25 is possible? Am I getting off course and editorializing too much already?  That is the value add you come here for, isn’t it?  Okay, let’s talk about the celebrations. WoW Turns 20 Blizz has the event broken out in their post nicely enough, so I am just going to use that.  Two can play this stealing game Blizz! When: October 22, 2024 – January 6, 2025 Where: Outside the Caverns of Time in Tanaris Here’s what you can look forward to during the WoW 20th Anniversary Celebration: Earn and spend a new currency, Bronze Celebration Tokens, to spend on new items for your collection. Engage in the Blackrock Depths Raid dungeon Collect Iconic Tier 2 transmog appearance sets Go Timewalking through Classic World of Warcraft Dungeons Earn a New Mount, Blizzard Employee Service Award cosmetics, and More Celebrate with an expanded event at the Caverns of Time Join Chromie on a new time-bending adventure with the Codex of Chromie Discover new secrets and solve them with Guest Relations Defeat Party-Crashing World Bosses including the Sha of Anger and Archavon the Stonewatcher Go back for some PvP revenge during Korrak’s Revenge in Alterac Valley Celebrate 30 Years of Warcraft with Warcraft III themed back appearances on the Trading Post Players level 10 and up will receive the quest, “Another Timely Invitation,” inviting them to the celebration in Tanaris outside the Caverns of Time. You’ll speak with Yllana to turn in your quest and then pick up some one-time quests to learn more about the event. All of which means you need to find the portal to the Caverns of Time… there is such a thing up in the old tower in Stormwind… and head on out of the cavern where you’ll find a fair laid out, with that big sword stuck in Azeroth visible in the distance.  Did that show up with Battle for Azeroth?  I forget. The event with the silhouette of the sword in the distance I found it a bit disorienting… but I also play WoW Classic with the old UI and so the whole new UI layout and such is different enough to require me to relearn a lot or go away.  I did a couple of the intro quests and then went away. So that is the kick off of the big event.  Over in WoW Classic… we have nothing on the calendar.  If you’re playing 14 year old WoW you don’t get to celebrate 20 years. I was also a bit disappointed that, during my brief visit to retail, I did not see the $90 Brutorsaur mount out and about anywhere.  I thought surely there would be one in the middle of the square in the grand tradition of “that guy on the mount” in Azeroth.  But maybe $90 was too dear.  Or maybe I just don’t go to the places where people show off those sorts of things in retail anymore.  Stormwind is pretty old school at this point. A pity.  It is a handsome mount, and even comes with an auctioneer and a mailbox, so you can do your business on the go. This baby will hold so many auctions If you want a better deal… for specific definitions of “better” I suppose… for just $30 they’ll sell you eight special edition mounts to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the franchise.  I guess it always comes back to commerce. Anyway, the event runs out into the new year.   Lots of time to partake.  The actual 20th anniversary of the game is a month out still and I suspect there will be an achievement for logging in closer to that date as well.  We shall see.",
