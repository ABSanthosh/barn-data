  "text": "\"Our community is everything, and we're always looking for ways to improve.\" Image credit: Kinetic Games Phasmophobia developer Kinetic Games has outlined what's coming up in the first event of 2025, Cursed Hollow, when it launches on 17th April. Fans can expect \"new bone-chilling challenges and secrets to uncover\", as well as a number of \"exciting changes from previous events\" including new reward categories, daily map rotation - nine of which have been seasonally decorated - and gameplay modifiers as you unearth mysterious Jackalope totems. Let's Play Phasmophobia! SOLO ZOE TRIES THE NEW UPDATE \u0026 ALREADY REGRETS THIS Let's Play Phasmophobia! SOLO ZOE TRIES THE NEW UPDATE \u0026 ALREADY REGRETS THIS.Watch on YouTube Players can also expect \"additional reworks\" recommended by the Phasmo community itself, including two different types of rewards: Community and Personal. Completing the former will grant points that go towards the wider community pool, whilst personal rewards are precisely that. However, to unlock personal objectives, players have to work together to reach the Community goal first. \"During Cursed Hollow, Ghost Hunters will need to work together to identify ghosts, complete objectives, and search for Jackalope totems hidden across the game’s maps,\" the developer teased. \"But beware: interacting with the totems will have eerie effects, some helpful, and some that may hinder even the most experienced of teams.\" \"We're really excited for Cursed Hollow to launch next week, and once again have our players join together to tackle this season's Community goals,\" said lead developer and director of Kinetic Games, Daniel \"Dknighter\" Knight. \"We've made some changes this year following direct feedback from our previous events; from the new reward split, to some interesting new gameplay modifiers. Our community is everything, and we're always looking for ways to improve - we hope everyone enjoys what 'Cursed Hollow' has in store for them this Easter, and keeps the feedback coming on what they want to see in the future.\" Cursed Hollow will kick off on 17th April and run for three weeks. Phasmophobia is available on PC via Steam, PS5, PS VR2, and Xbox Series X/S The ghost-hunting sim has sold two million copies on console since it came out of early access last October, bringing the total sales across all platforms to 22 million. The development team recently outlined the road ahead for the spooky sim in 2025, confirming map reworks, new ghost-hunting equipment, \"thrilling seasonal events\", and a brand-new location, too.",
