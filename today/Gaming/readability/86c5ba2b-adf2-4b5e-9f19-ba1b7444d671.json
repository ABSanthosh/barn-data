He leads his mother through this beautiful northern English terrain. But of course, around them hiding in forests and hills and woods are the infected. But he finds a doctor who is a man we might think is going to be weird and odd, but actually is a force for good.”Fiennes' comments are the firmest 28 Years Later story details revealed so far, with the plot otherwise remaining largely under wraps. The new movie, which will see Boyle return to the director's chair, will once again star Cillian Murphy, where he will be joined by Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Fiennes. The Marvels director Nia DaCosta is reportedly helming the second movie in the trilogy.The Best Zombie MoviesFirst announced in January, 28 Years Later picks up the story of 28 Days Later (2002) and 28 Weeks Later (2007), a pair of post-apocalyptic zombie films set in and around London in which humans have been infected by a so-called Rage Virus akin to rabies. The original movie is considered a seminal part of the zombie canon and one of the greatest horror movies ever made.28 Years Later is set to release on June 20, 2025, with its follow-up, 28 Years Later II: The Bone Temple, to follow at a later date.Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.
