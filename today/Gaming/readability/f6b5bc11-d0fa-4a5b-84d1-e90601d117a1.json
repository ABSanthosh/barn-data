  "text": "Because \"the story of killing Nazis is evergreen\". Amazon MGM Studios has selected yet another video game series for a TV show adaptation - and this time it's Wolfenstein. As reported by Variety, the exact plot details have yet to be disclosed, but the show's official tagline reminds us that \"the story of killing Nazis is evergreen\". Fallout Season 2 Teaser Fallout season two teaser.Watch on YouTube Jonah Nolan (aka Jonathan Nolan) and Lisa Joy - names you would've seen on the credits of Fallout - are already on board as executive producers, along with Athena Wickham, James Altman, and MachineGames' Jerk Gustafsson. Patrick Somerville will serve as creator, writer, executive producer, and showrunner under his production company, chaoticgood.tv. Variety reports Somerville - who created the shows Maniac and Station Eleven - has reportedly been a fan of the Wolfenstein games \"since he was a child\". Amazon is clearly looking to replicate the success of its hugely successful game-to-TV adaptation, Fallout, which has already been renewed for a third season on Amazon Prime, even though the show's second season's December 2025 debut is still months away. More than 100 million people have watched Fallout's first season to date, Amazon has revealed, making it one of the streamer's top three launches ever. Amazon is now moving quickly to make more of the show, and begin teasing its second batch of episodes with another longing look at the Las Vegas skyline at the end of the below trailer. Other in-progress TV adaptations at Amazon include a series based on Mass Effect, God of War, and Warhammer 40,000. In fact, Amazon is so confident of its God of War adaptation, it has ordered a second season before the first has even been aired.",
