Bake brownies, and perhaps share those with the neighbors, too, when I drop off the chili. Go on a long hike, then come home and drink hot apple cider. Buy an epic pair of rain boots. Go for a walk with Marnie and stomp into a pile of leaves with those epic rain boots. Snuggle into a warm, cozy sweater that makes me feel amazing when I wear it.

Bake brownies, and perhaps share those with the neighbors, too, when I drop off the chili. OH YEEEEAH Go on a long hike, then come home and drink hot apple cider. Buy an epic pair of rain boots. Go for a walk with Marnie and stomp into a pile of leaves with those epic rain boots. Snuggle into a warm, cozy sweater that makes me feel amazing when I wear it.

Handwrite a few letters on nice stationary and send them via snail mail. Watch a classic musical wearing my coziest pajamas; of course a snuggly blanket will be up in the mix, too. Find a soft, brightly colored scarf; perhaps one that has a matching hat, ideally with a pompom on top. Drink hot tea from my favorite cup and saucer on a rainy afternoon while I read a new book.
