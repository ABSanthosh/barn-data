  "text": "What The Fish needs you to compose scam emails and not get all caught up in that delightful fishing game that’s on your desktop. You’re the new outreach coordinator (although I could have sworn the game told me I was writing phishing emails…) for Ichthys, a company you are going to have to spellcheck a few times every minute as you compose their sketchy business emails and send them out to your clients. Your main job is to type out these emails by following what is written on the screen. Trouble is, things keep popping up and getting in your way. Ads will keep blocking your screen, making it impossible to see what you’re supposed to write. Work keeps checking to see if you’re working. And this darn fish game seems to insist on your attention. The fishing game is where the fun in your work day lies. It’s not terribly complicated, but there is a depth to it. You can click on fish as they float on by, slowly increasing your in-game money and experience. You can spend your money on upgrades that will call better fish to your pond, auto catch fish here and there, and give you various other improvements. Some of these cost you your actual money you earn from answering emails, but it’s not like you have anything else to spend your money on. Although it quickly turns into you doing your actual job in order to finance your time in the fishing game. Emails are boring anyway. But it also feels like something is off with your computer. But that’s a problem for later. It’s time to fish now! What The Fish does a solid job of getting you interested in its fishing game (I tried to be diligent but there’s only so many emails I can answer). It’s mix of horror and work gel in a strange way that felt a bit jarring and disconnected, but if you want a few frights mixed with your fishing and email writing, it’s a quick, fun experience. What The Fish is available now on itch.io.
