  "description": "Rosie, being scientifically oriented, has an affinity for baking. She appreciates the precision and thinks of it like working in a lab, except one where youâ€™re able to sample the fruits of your labor. Weâ€™re all so excited because she opened her new French bakery, La boulangerie de Rosie, in Novato this weekend. I know! Very exciting. Unfortunately for Rosie, Marnie was her baking assistant, but it doesnâ€™t look like thatâ€™s going to work out because Marnie has no regard for recipes or measurementsâ€¦or really, any kind of precision. Actually, Rosie didnâ€™t come up with the idea for the bakery herself. Tabs, as you know, was very forwarding thinking, and toward the last years of his reign he planned to open a high-end cat bakery that also catered to humans (but also cats), and Rosie borrowed the idea. We can safely assume that if Tabs had gotten the business off the ground, it would have been a huge success. Yup, everything that cat touched turned to gold. ðŸ’› Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 856 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
