  "text": "Will the impending end of the campaign draw in more backers?  Will there be a last minute rush?  Some excitement?  Something crazy to draw some attention?  Maybe? Stars Reach – The Campaign Continues I mentioned in a past post… or two… about the U-shaped nature these campaigns often adopt.  The true believers, they jump in right away, so if the company has done its work the first 48-hours are a land rush business of backers jumping on the bandwagon and other mixed metaphors. Basically, that starting bit is the happy time… and if it isn’t, if you aren’t beyond half way to your goal after 48 hours, then you have done something wrong. Not a problem for Stars Reach.  The team keeps reminding us that they reached their funding goal in under an hour. Campaign Goal Reached You can pick your reason for that; good pre-game work, popular product, or a low goal are all possibilities, and are not mutually exclusive.  So everything after that first hour was… gravy? Yes and no.  Yes, the team gets to declare victory and the ads on Reddit… using the Reddit app on my iPad means I see ads, but since I gave up Twitter after it went full Nazi I needed somewhere to doom scroll on the couch… carry the “winning” message on the funding front. What we don’t know… what we will likely never know unless somebody writes a tell all about the game some years down the road… is what the internal goal of the team is, because it sure wasn’t $200K.  I have trouble believing there was a hope for anything less than a million, but maybe their investor pitch works with $500K or $800K. What the last stretch will determine is how big the number is that they get to use in their pitch.  The campaign is still in the doldrums and has four negative funding days so far according to Kicktraq… and today isn’t starting out so great. Daily Pledge Totals for the Campaign I was actually swapped to the campaign tab on my browser yesterday and saw the funding amount go down.  Things seem to be sputtering back and forth just over the $600K mark. But we are not yet in that final 48 hours where the fence sitters finally opt-in or go away and FOMO overtakes some of the true believers and they go in and up their commitment to a higher tier.  The question is, how big will that final burst be… and will there be one at all. However, Bhagpuss yesterday noted that there are suggestions out there that campaigns these days… and I will admit I haven’t been watching them since Crowfall or so… are a lot more front loaded, so there often isn’t as big of a bounce at the end. If that is true, then $700K seems like the absolute maximum we can expect, as the campaign has lingered around $600K for a couple of days now, with those negative value days noted above in the mix, and I feel much less certain about us getting are new doo for hitting 5K backers, as the campaign is struggling to pass the 4K mark. Totally not playing the Star Wars card here This seemed like a slam dunk a week ago, not I am not so sure. Maybe the team has something left in the tank to ignite some last minute interest, something that will push the undecided watchers into their camp, because they have just about half of the people who were following the campaign before it went live on board as backers. The team, however, seems very much set to carry on only showing exactly what was available in pre-alpha before the campaign started and to let Raph hand wave vision about what the plan is for anything else.  That a plan that runs headlong into both the “we’ve been lied to so often about vision before” aspect of these campaigns as well as the “what have you done for us lately?” question about Raph. For the former, I am reminded of the Kasper Gutman quote from The Maltese Falcon: …this is genuine coin of the realm. With a dollar of this, you can buy ten dollars of talk. An industry history of overselling or failing to deliver on vision means a dollar of live, playable demo will buy you a hundred, or even a thousand dollars of talk.  And the more Raph talks… and Raph is a prodigious spinner of vision in an industry that swims in an overflowing pool of vision… the more you realize how little of the vision is encompassed in the pre-alpha. Meanwhile, the latter is the reason they keep farming the SWG user base, winking, waggling eyebrows, and gesturing provocatively to suggest that this will be a remake of that title, because SWG is the last success Raph has to stand on.  That was more than 20 years ago.  Hell, SWG has been dead for nearly 15 years at this point. This is probably why the initial round of MMORPG Kickstarter campaigns went as well as they did, each of those famous names was only a decade or so away from success.  In 2025 would any of them have raised as much? Meanwhile, their whole social goal thing… well, I am not going to follow them on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram because I’d like to avoid platforms owned by billionaires complicit in the destruction of our government.  A blog post a week is my level of social effort and there isn’t even a category for that.  Also, I have no idea what this is actually tracking. I guess I haven’t added to that at all I don’t know.  I am really just fishing around for reasons why the campaign looks set to come up well short of the million dollars I keep mentioning as an impressive number while trying to imagine ways that the team might get there.  Having the attention of the niche MMO press is fine… Massively OP is cheer leading as much as they can… but the whole thing doesn’t seem to have seeped out much further in any significant way. We shall see.  We are not yet to that final 48 hours.  Maybe there is still a surprise coming.

id=\"caption-attachment-133186\"\u003eTotally not playing the Star Wars card here\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis seemed like a slam dunk a week ago, not I am not so sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe the team has something left in the tank to ignite some last minute interest, something that will push the undecided watchers into their camp, because they have just about half of the people who were following the campaign before it went live on board as backers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe team, however, seems very much set to carry on only showing exactly what was available in pre-alpha before the campaign started and to let Raph hand wave vision about what the plan is for anything else.  That a plan that runs headlong into both the “we’ve been lied to so often about vision before” aspect of these campaigns as well as the “what have you done for us lately?” question about Raph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the former, I am reminded of the Kasper Gutman quote from \u003cem\u003eThe Maltese Falcon:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e…this is genuine coin of the realm. With a dollar of this, you can buy ten dollars of talk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn industry history of overselling or failing to deliver on vision means a dollar of live, playable demo will buy you a hundred, or even a thousand dollars of talk.  And the more Raph talks… and Raph is a prodigious spinner of vision in an industry that swims in an overflowing pool of vision… the more you realize how little of the vision is encompassed in the pre-alpha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the latter is the reason they keep farming the \u003cem\u003eSWG\u003c/em\u003e user base, winking, waggling eyebrows, and gesturing provocatively to suggest that this will be a remake of that title, because \u003cem\u003eSWG\u003c/em\u003e is the last success Raph has to stand on.  That was more than 20 years ago.  Hell, \u003cem\u003eSWG\u003c/em\u003e has been dead for nearly 15 years at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is probably why the initial round of MMORPG Kickstarter campaigns went as well as they did, each of those famous names was only a decade or so away from success.  In 2025 would any of them have raised as much?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, their whole social goal thing… well, I am not going to follow them on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram because I’d like to avoid platforms owned by billionaires complicit in the destruction of our government.  A blog post a week is my level of social effort and there isn’t even a category for that.  Also, I have no idea what this is actually tracking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_133328\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

I am really just fishing around for reasons why the campaign looks set to come up well short of the million dollars I keep mentioning as an impressive number while trying to imagine ways that the team might get there.  Having the attention of the niche MMO press is fine… Massively OP is cheer leading as much as they can… but the whole thing doesn’t seem to have seeped out much further in any significant way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe shall see.  We are not yet to that final 48 hours.  Maybe there is still a surprise
