These include both productivity and gaming monitors, and they can be combined with instant discounts. This drops the price of several popular and well-rated monitors to the lowest we've ever seen, even compared to Black Friday. The coupon is set to expire on February 3.Featured in this articleYou can quickly browse through all of the listed products on sale above. See below for our favorite picks.32\" Alienware 4K QD OLED Gaming Monitor for $76532\" Alienware AW3225QF 4K 240Hz QD-OLED Gaming MonitorThis Alienware high-end gaming monitor deal just got even better. Last week, the 32\" Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD OLED gaming monitor dropped to $899.99, matching the deal we saw during Black Friday. Today, there's a brand new 15% off coupon code \"MONITORS15\" that drops the price even further to $764.99. If you're looking for the best 4K gaming monitor, this should definitely be on your short list. This is the monitor I currently use and highly recommend it.The Alienware AW3225QF was first announced during CES 2024 and is actually Dell's one and only monitor that combines a 4K resolution with an OLED panel. It incorporates Samsung's QD OLED technology; QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels while maintaining near infinite response time, contrast ratio, and black levels. The Alienware AW3225QF is HDR True Black 400 certified with up to 1,000 nits of peak brightness. It also boasts a 99.3% DCI-P3 color range and is factory calibrated. Other specs include a 1700R curve, 240Hz refresh rate, and G-Sync certification. Something to keep in mind is that 4K monitors require a pretty powerful GPU. 4K resolution has 2.25 times more pixels than QHD; if you want to play games in 4K, especially at frame rates of up to 240fps, you'll want a gaming PC equipped with an GeForce RTX 4070 at the minimum. If your PC is equipped with something as powerful as an RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4090, or RX 7900XTX, then this monitor would be the perfect complement.34\" Dell S3422DWG Ultra-Wide Gaming Monitor for $271.9934\" Dell S3422DWG WQHD 144Hz Gaming MonitorThe best gaming monitor from Dell in terms of value is the 34\" Dell S3422DWG ultra-wide gaming monitor, and it's down to the lowest price ever. In fact, this is the first time I've seen it priced under $300. Right now you can get it for only $271.99 shipped after the 15% off coupon code \"MONITORS15\".The Dell S3422DWG is a 34\" monitor with a 16:10 ultra-wide aspect ratio, 3440x1440 resolution, 144Hz refresh rate, 1800R curve, and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro certification. 1440p resolution is a solid sweet spot when you have to compromise between image quality and performance. A 34\" 1440p display boasts a sharp 108ppi pixel density but it won't tax your system as heavily as a 4K display. You can pair it with a GeForce RTX 4070 and get high framerates in most games.32\" Dell S3222DGM Gaming Monitor for $195.4932\" Dell S3222DGM QHD 165Hz VA Gaming MonitorIf you're looking for a budget gaming monitor that's still good, then look no further than Dell's 32\" S3222DGM gaming monitor, which drops to under $200 with the 15% off coupon code \"MONITORS15\". This monitor was $199.99 on Black Friday, so you can get it for a few dollars cheaper during this sale. The S3222DGM is a 32\" monitor with a more traditional 2560x1440 resolution, 165Hz refresh rate, and 1800R curve. The VA panel boasts a fast 1ms (2ms gray-to-gray) response time, 100% sRGB color space, and AMD FreeSync Premium certification.22\" Dell SE2225H Productivity Monitor for $59.4922\" Dell SE2225H 1080p VA MonitorThe Dell SE225H is solid productivity monitor at a bargain price. It's normally priced at an already reasonable $89.99, but the coupon code \"MONITORS15\" drops it to only $59.49. This is a no-frills 22\" monitor with a 1080p resolution, 60Hz refresh rate, and HDMI and VGA inputs.Check out all of the best Dell and Alienware gaming deals of 2025.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
