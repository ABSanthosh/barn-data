To help you prepare for the journey ahead, we compiled 10 things we think you’ll find useful so you can mentally prepare for the launch day. There are a lot of misconceptions about the game floating around, especially that it’s an MMORPG, so we are here to clear the air. Is Rune Slayer a PvP game? When Rune Slayer was first revealed, it was labeled as a PvE focused game with PvP. Naturally, we got confused and wondered what the heck it actually was. Even though the trailer above portraits it as a PvP game, Rune Slayer is 90% PvE. You’ll be doing quests, gathering materials, and lots of raids with your friends. There is a PvP element, but it’s honestly not that deep. Other players can attack you, and you can fight back but you are encouraged from doing this, plus there is a bounty system. Does Rune Slayer have full loot PvP No, it doesn’t. If you die to another player in Rune Slayer, you just respawn at your set spawn location, and continue playing. There’s very little penalty for actually dying in Rune Slayer, but that’s probably because it’s so common. Is Rune Slayer an MMORPG? You’ve probably seen this one coming, but don’t expect Rune Slayer to have a massive number of players. After all, a Roblox server can normally hold up to 50 people. A Rune Slayer server can only hold 18 players, which is more than enough, if you ask us. You can form parties to do dungeons and quests together but don’t expect large-scale battles like in other MMORPGs. Can you craft in Rune Slayer Screenshot by OlvaarGaming Yes, you can craft weapons, armor and other items in Rune Slayer. There is also a profession system for each type of gathering. Naturally, it wouldn’t be a real game without fishing and cooking either. There’s a lot to craft, but combat is definitely the main focus. Does Rune Slayer have a hunger bar Yes, Rune Slayer has a hunger bar. As scary as that might sound, it’s more of a minor annoyance than a game mechanic. If you forget to eat, your health and mana will stop recovering naturally, so it’s a good idea to bring something to munch on. Alternatively, if you don’t have any food, you can simply die and respawn with a full hunger bar. Brutal? Sure, but it’s still effective. Can you tame animals in Rune Slayer Screenshot by OlvaarGaming Yes, you can tame animals in Rune Slayer. You can even ride them. If this sounds fun to you and you want to tame them all, you can even become a Beast Hunter and get access to some animals no other classes get to tame. The animals can even assist you in battle, which can make a huge difference if you’re playing solo. Is there a bank in Rune Slayer Yes, there is a bank in every major outpost in Rune Slayer. You can use it as much as you want, buy additional slots but since you don’t lose items when you get killed in the wild, it’s not absolutely mandatory. We use it to store extra crafting material, rare potions and, of course, Runes. Do you have to craft in Rune Slayer Screenshot by OlvaarGaming No, you don’t need to craft in Rune Slayer. Some of the best weapons in the game drop from tough raid bosses and you can also trade with other players. With that said, we highly recommend you craft at least the basic armor early in the game, just so you can get a head start. Are there racial buffs in Rune Slayer Screenshot by OlvaarGaming Yes, there are racial buffs in Rune Slayer, and they can give you unique benefits. When you create your first character, you’ll be assigned one of the 14 species (previously known as “races”) at random. Unfortunately, this is a gacha system, and you can indeed buy race rerolls either in the character creator or from within the game. Thankfully, almost all races have their uses. Humans are tanky, Orcs do good melee damage, and Elves are great with ranged damage and magic. There are also rare classes like the Dullahan (cat-like race), which can run and jump faster, but you only have a 2% chance of rolling them. Does Rune Slayer have multiclass Yes, Rune Slayer does let you pick more than one class, but you absolutely shouldn’t do this. The way how it works is: every time you level up, you invest one point into your class. This means that, later down the line, if you start multiclassing, you can potentially miss out on your main classes strongest abilities. Nobody seems to be doing multiclassing in Rune Slayer, so you shouldn’t either. That’s all there is to it. Now you’re ready to play Rune Slayer.
