  "text": "As mentioned previously, Goonswarm Federation pulled up stakes and left the Delve region, where we had lived for the last eight years, and moved to Tenerifis. From Delve to the east This was a huge undertaking that involved thousands of freighter loads of stuff being hauled across several regions.  CCP had an infographic about the scope of the move, but posted it somewhere I couldn’t find it again so… I won’t be sharing that. I moved a bunch of stuff myself and packed up more to put in some of those freighters, heading both to Tenerifis and Jita… the latter to sell, as I had quite a few hulls that were no longer used in any fleet doctrine and were unlikely to come back around any time soon.  The Megathron has gone the way of the Maelstrom; once the center of mighty fleets, now rarely seen in null sec space. It also meant that I had to tear down all my planetary industry (PI), which has been my sole steady source of income over the last few years.  I have no patience for ratting or mining or any of the variations of missions or incursions anymore.  I just want to undock and crash fleets together or be left alone. So PI has helped me along.  You set it up and, if you do it right… right for me at least… you tend to it once in a while then haul off the results maybe once a month to sell at the local market. And I suppose, technically, I did not have to tear down all my PI.  I could have left it back in Delve.  I just did not relish the commute, the need to haul my only commodity of value across four regions that have been conspicuously camped due to the big move.  And even if being exploded wasn’t a hazard, I just want to keep this as simple and as close to home as possible. So I tore it all down and then moved stuff east and waited for things to settled down. Once things started getting built up, including demand for my output, it was time to start again. As part of keeping this all simple I just make mechanical parts, a tier 2 PI output. You setup on a barren planet, harvest base metals and noble metals, refining them into reactive and precious metals, which you then turn into mechanical parts.  Then you move them to the launch pad and sent them up to the customs office… or up to the Skyhook now… are there Skyhooks on barren planets, I don’t remember and haven’t gone out to collect yet… and haul them to market to sell. The demand for them… they are part of what is required to build fuel blocks for structures… started to pick up and the excess that I hauled east eventually started selling so it was time to get going again. Were I the savvy, try hard PI player… well, to start with I would be making more than just mechanical parts.   But I would also have spent a good deal of time seeking out little used barren planets where I could get the highest extraction amounts possible so as to get the most value out of my PI time. But I am lazy and somewhat indifferent, so my idea barrens planet is one in a system with five others so I can just pick everything up in one system.  And, honestly, I was too lazy to even look for that until I got to my third character.  So I got out there and went to a few systems a bit away from our staging, but not annoyingly so, then started looking for barren planets, looking for locations that weren’t being over harvested and which had good patches of noble and base metals not too far from each other, as distance matters. On finding a likely location it was time to plop down a command center… there are specific command centers for each planet type… and upgrade it. Command Center Upgrade Window Like ships, your PI installation is limited by power and CPU, which is controlled by the command center.  Your ability to upgrade the command center… and a number of other things… is controlled by your skills in Planetary Management.  But I am all V across the board, so take it to the make, full upgrades and six planets. skills to pay the bills On looking at that, I am pretty sure Command Center Upgrades unlocks… command center upgrades! That done, I set down two extractor control units, one for base and the other for noble metals, each in the middle of their respective patch of white, where the best harvesting is. Extractors laid out It is difficult to see, but that window shows that I have chosen a 7 day harvesting window, all the better to keep me from having to think about PI more than once a week. Once those two are running I put down a storage facility, connect both extractor control units to it, then route their output so that it gets delivered there.  Since the extraction cycle is two hours long, I then run along to the next planet to drop command centers and extractors, then the next, then the next. You only have to be undocked and in the system with your planet to drop the command center,  after that you can do everything remotely while safely docked up. Once that is all done I start setting up the factory zone.  I choose to put the storage facility on a line equidistant between the two extractor control units, then build up around it. The factory setup I build four basic industry units, two of each to convert base and noble metals into reactive and precious metals, and two advanced industry facilities to convert reaction and precious metals into mechanical parts, and then a launchpad as the final storage point, which is also required to get the output into space so I can collect it. So I end up with something that looks a bit like this. A factory layout Then I have to link them all and create routes… and you cannot create routes from the storage facility until there are resources in it so I have to wait at two points for things to catch up… and the whole thing runs somewhat in sync, with extractors delivering raw material every two hours, basic industry outputting 20 refined components each every thirty minutes and the advanced industry putting out five final products every hour. The tighter I keep that layout, the less command center resources it uses and the more flexibility I have with the extractors, which is all I ever fiddle with once things are setup. All of this is about an hour of effort per character across a few hours of time to let materials build up in order to be routed, so I did this one character at a time over three days and I end up with layouts that look mostly like this. A planetary colony view There is apparently a way to setup PI templates for planets that was introduce recently, but it is hidden pretty well in the UI and given all the complaints I saw about it I just rolled along and did it the way I have done in the past. After that, it is just the weekly restarting of the extractors to keep the process going.  Every week I go through and open up each colony window and open up each extractor control unit in order to restart it.  My only regular change is to look at the estimated output of all of the extractors and to adjust the lowest one on the list to improve it. That won’t do! The outputs change from week to week depending on how many other people are harvesting in the same area on the same planet.  On a pristine planet I once had extractors pulling 300 units per cycle, but 150-200 is the range I generally work in… at least until too many people show up and it starts to decay. If I keep up on restarting the extractors each planet will end up producing about 100 million in ISK worth of mechanical parts a month.  With six planets per character and three characters in play in null sec (I tried it in high sec for a while and the planets are so low yield that it was comical) is enough to keep me in the ISK I need to keep playing. None of this is meant to be a tutorial.  I am probably doing a bunch of things, if not wrong, then at least sub-optimally.  But once it is setup it, it all just sort of runs. If you want to know how things really work, you should probably look at the EVE Uni Wiki page about PI.",
