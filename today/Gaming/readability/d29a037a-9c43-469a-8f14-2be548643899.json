It's a fun and relaxing hobby that allows you to turn a simple lined image into a beautiful masterpiece. You get to choose what colors to use and whether or not you stay within the lines.With more adults purchasing coloring books for themselves, we're starting to see an increase in options specifically aimed at an adult audience. One such franchise that has gotten in on the action is Demon Slayer. There have already been two official Demon Slayer coloring books released and there's a third one that is currently up for preorder at Amazon.Preorder the New Demon Slayer Coloring BookDemon Slayer: The Official Coloring Book 3Demon Slayer: The Official Coloring Book 2Demon Slayer: The Official Coloring BookThe third official Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba coloring book is currently set to release on April 8, 2025. The book features art from Koyoharu Gotouge and includes scenes from the Swordsmith Village arc, the Hashira Training arc, and the Infinity Castle arc. There are more than 70 line drawings featuring the characters from the beloved manga series, including: Tanjiro Kamado, Nezuko Kamado, Zenitsu Agatsuma, and Inosuke Hashibira.If you're interested in this upcoming coloring book, there's also the previous two editions worth considering. The first two Demon Slayer coloring books offer a similar experience, but with entirely different drawings and scenes from the manga. If you're looking for something similar to Demon Slayer, however, there are quite a few other adult coloring books based on manga worth checking out.See more like this:What Utensils are Best for Adult Coloring Books?If you're new to the world of adult coloring books, you'll likely need to purchase some actual coloring supplies. My overall favorite coloring utensils to use are colored pencils, but you can also get a nice set of markers or gel pens if you prefer. Here's a quick rundown of what utensils to buy if you're getting into coloring.Colored PencilsA good set of colored pencils will offer more precision and detail than markers, but it depends on what quality you buy. If you pick up a pack of cheap Crayola colored pencils, you will still be able to color, but it won't blend as well and the quality won't be as nice. I personally recommend Prismacolor Premier colored penicils, which is what I use if I'm ever coloring anything.Prismacolor Premier Colored PencilsMarkersWhile colored pencils offer more precision and detail, markers are great for vibrant colors and faster coloring. The overall best makers for coloring books are alcohol based. Alcohol markers are easier to blend and always dry quickly. This is ideal for avoiding the visible streaks you'd see with water-based markers. I'd recommend the Ohuhu alcohol markers, which I've used for several projects before.Gel PensFalling somewhere between colored pencils and markers, gel pens are great for fine detail while also offering vibrant color. Unlike standard ink pens, gel pens utilize a water-based gel ink that is thicker and smoother (so more like paint). While I think colored pencils and markers are a better option for coloring, if you like the look and feel of pens, I'd recommend getting this set of Gelly Roll pens from Amazon.Jacob Kienlen is a Senior SEO Strategist and Writer for IGN.
