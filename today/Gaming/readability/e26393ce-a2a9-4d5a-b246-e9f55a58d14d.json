  "text": "SummaryDiscover more about the world of Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree, coming to Xbox Series X|S on April 17.Brian Mitsoda, who penned the story and its fantasy world, shares insights about development.Branching narrative, where choices you make define your character’s fate and the fate of Faelduum. Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree is an ambitious action RPG set in a dark fantasy world. Developed by Primal Game Studio, it features challenging Soulslike combat and an expansive story that promises over 40 hours of gameplay. With six classes to master, an intricate Talent Tree system to progress, and a sprawling, interconnected world to discover, this is a world you can truly succumb to. Find out more about how Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree immerses you in its dark fantasy with insights from writer Brian Mitsoda. Defy Your Fate, Inquisitor Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree is set in the world of Faelduum. Inspired by myths, folklore, and fairy tales, this is a land where magic is very real, but outlawed. City-states are governed by tyrannical archmages, and justice is done upon magic-using ‘heretics’ by Inquisitors. You play one such Inquisitor, whose fateful decision at the start of the game sets them on a path of defiance that will lead them to the darkness festering in the heart of Faelduum. “Personally, one of the things that drew me to the project was the strong Castlevania influence, as that’s one of my favorite games series of all time,” says writer Brian Mitsoda, who shaped the lore, characters, and worldbuilding in Mandragora together with the team at Primal Game Studio. “The dark fantasy elements reminded me of Berserk, and there was also a bit of traditional folk tale and fairy tale influence.” Some of that influence can be seen in the monsters. From wild wolves to bloodthirsty vampires and other creatures of the night, there’s a veritable bestiary out for your blood. Blades (or spells) at the ready, then. Entropy Is Coming At the beginning of your Inquisitor’s quest, they discover that monsters are bleeding into Faelduum through tears in reality created by the mysterious, parallel plane of Entropy. The path forward is clear: Entropy must be cut off if Faelduum is to survive. And to do that, you’ll have to contend with legions of beasts and even more challenging bosses. But even with world-ending stakes, Brian says it’s important to keep players focused on having a good time. “The most important part of the game is the gameplay, so for me, I always ask how I can complement it without bringing it to a grinding halt,” says Brian. “For example, if you’re fighting a bandit, I want you to know why they’re in your path aside from the fact that they’re called “bandits” and they’ve got enemy HP bars over their heads. If you want to know more, you can get some information from the environments and bestiary. If you pay attention to background dialogue, you’ll learn more about the state of the area.” Characters are vividly brought to life by a cast of incredible voice actors—including Aysha Selim (Overwatch 2, World of Warcraft)—with many unique regional accents fleshing out the geographical scope and cultures of Faelduum. Ripples Through Reality “I’ve been playing video games since I was old enough to hold a controller, but what made me want to write them is that, unlike traditional mediums, the player can have a more active role in deciding everything—from their relationship with a character to the way the world is changed by their actions. There’s an active element in game design that makes everything feel a lot more personal.” With Brian’s background in branching narratives, it’s no surprise that players will be presented with choices at various points in the game. “We let the player define who the Inquisitor is with their dialogue and story choices, so the main character’s fate isn’t set in stone,” says Brian. And though the world is extremely dark and cynical, he believes there is “hope for redemption” for your Inquisitor. But that choice lies in your hands. Finally, Brian has one piece of advice for new Inquisitors set to begin their quests in Mandragora: “Don’t sleep on the Caravan character quests. You get to learn a lot more of their secrets if you do these. Really happy with the way they came out!” What will you become at journey’s end?
