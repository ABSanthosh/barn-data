Within a month of Final Fantasy 16's June 2023 release, Square Enix claimed they had been \"extremely strong\", but admitted one month later that sales did not meet expectations. Last week, we learned the Final Fantasy series has now sold over 200m copies across the globe, cementing Final Fantasy as one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, even if sales have dipped in more recent years. Square Enix shared the announcement on social media, along with the news the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series alone has sold over 5m copies worldwide.",
