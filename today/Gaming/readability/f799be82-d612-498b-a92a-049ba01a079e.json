  "text": "Scheduled for release on February 28, 2025, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a sequel to action adventure Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. This new title features the series’ fan-favorite, Goro Majima, as the sole protagonist. I recently had a conversation with Mr. Masayoshi Yokoyama, RGG Studio Director and the Like a Dragon Series Executive Producer, along with Mr. Hiroyuki Sakamoto, the Like a Dragon Series, RGG Studio Chief Producer, about the game’s highlights and the behind-the-scenes stories of its development. PlayStation Blog: As a fan of the series, I’m most curious about why you chose Majima and pirates. How did this title come about in the first place? Yokoyama: Around June or July 2023, long before the release of Infinite Wealth, the dev team was already mulling over the idea of an Infinite Wealth spin-off. Even if we were to make Like a Dragon 9, we knew that wouldn’t be enough to capture and tell the story. During the end of the Infinite Wealth development, we began percolating the idea of a spin-off that stars characters who are not Ichiban Kasuga. It was almost as if we were creating a blown-up sub-story for Infinite Wealth. For quite some time, I wanted to make a game called Like a Dragon: Tuna, where Kazuma Kiryu, as a tuna fisherman, sets off to sea to fight against fishing boats. Long story short, it never came to fruition, but keywords like “ship,” “sea,” and “fighting,” which had since then been engraved in my head, evolved into the concept of pirates. PSB: The series is known for starring different characters as the protagonists. For instance, Kazuma Kiryu takes the lead in Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name while Majima steps into the spotlight in Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. I must say one of the perks of spin-offs is the freedom of starring new characters who are not just Ichiban Kasuga. Yokoyama: I agree. As the protagonist changes in spin-offs, you can follow the same story from a different perspective. Also, spin-offs are perfect in size for adults. The Like a Dragon series is like an all-you-can-eat restaurant where you can choose from meat, seafood, and anything else you want and eat however much you like. But as you mature, you start to appreciate well-balanced, good-proportion meals. Spin-offs are like that. PSB: Can you describe who Majima is? Yokoyama: He masks his feelings and hides his true self. His past is mentioned throughout the series, yet the true Majima remains a puzzle. He feels the need to live up to the image that others have of him and adeptly go along with them. However, in this entry, he suffers from amnesia, exposing his true self as the story unfolds. PSB: Does that mean we will finally find out who the true Majima is? Yokoyama: You’ll understand who he is through his interactions with a boy called Noah. It turns out he’s just a tough dude who likes to fantasize a lot [laughs]. In Gaiden, while remembering his past, Majima looks at himself objectively and realizes who he really is. This is a novel story development. However, Majima is not the most conventional choice for a protagonist. His unpredictability, while not the norm, is what sets him apart and makes him intriguing. When a character like Majima becomes the protagonist, it creates a discrepancy between actions and emotions; when you get frustrated in a scene, but Majima does not even look bothered, you may feel confused.  To avoid that, we would need a neutral character who could act the way players anticipate from a protagonist. But the downside is that we’d end up with a boring protagonist. We gave Kiryu and Kasuga additional personalities to build them into protagonists, but if we did that to Majima, he’d turn out to be a boring guy. To make him a protagonist, we only had two options: amnesia or travel back in time. Without amnesia, Majima wouldn’t have worked as a protagonist.                   PSB: Next, I’d like to ask you about the battles. This time, Majima switches between two battle styles: Mad Dog and Sea Dog. Could you tell us about them? Sakamoto: In Gaiden, Kiryu also uses two different battle styles. We thought two was the right amount in order to keep battles from being too complicated. Since Majima uses nimble moves, we wanted to simplify his battle moves. Players can execute exhilarating moves by merely pressing the buttons. The Mad Dog Style is based on Majima’s battle style that executes combos, jumps, and other responsive actions. PSB:I played the demo version at the Tokyo Game Show 2024 and experienced some dynamic fights. What was the intention behind introducing jumping? Yokoyama: Introducing jumping changes the gameplay drastically. In fighting games, for example, players jump even when there’s no need to. Also, you’re defenseless while jumping, so if you get hit, you’ll be blown away. For that reason, in action games, you’re often invincible while jumping, but that can cause problems. Simply introducing jumping changes the game design, so we’ve avoided it until now. However, the team decided to incorporate jumping into the game because the character Majima looks good while jumping. This is the first time players can control the character’s ability to jump, rather than it just being a part of heated battles. It’s not a regular jump action but a form of jump incorporated into a combo. Yokoyama: Incorporating two battle styles in a game is quite complicated. If one style becomes way more entertaining, players will stop using the other one. It’s easy to label the battle styles under different characteristics, but it’s difficult to make them both equally enjoyable. The Sea Dog style turned out to be more interesting in this case and everyone ended up choosing this style. To top it off, the Sea Dog style has some fun costumes. Sakamoto: In the early stages of development, the Mad Dog style felt a bit plain, and no one was using it. So, we brainstormed ways to make this style more appealing, and we’re now in the fine-tuning stage to achieve the perfect balance between the two fighting styles.Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii launches Feb 28 2025 on PS5.",
