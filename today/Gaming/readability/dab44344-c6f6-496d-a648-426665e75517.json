  "text": "Prepare to bend the elements and battle like never before! From December 17 to December 30, Overwatch 2 is teaming up with Avatar: The Last Airbender in a legendary crossover event that promises to thrill both Overwatch fans and Avatar enthusiasts alike. This limited-time collaboration merges the iconic world of the Four Nations with your favorite Overwatch heroes, creating a lineup of elemental cosmetics and challenges that celebrate unity, resilience, and the unstoppable power of teamwork.    Overwatch 2 players will have the chance to channel the essence of Water, Earth, Fire, and Air through stunning character skins inspired by the unforgettable heroes of Avatar. Get ready to fight alongside your team just like Team Avatar, as these skins perfectly capture the spirit of bending.   Here’s the roster and what they bring to the battlefront: Zenyatta as Aang: The spiritual harmony of the Air Nomads comes alive through Zenyatta, who now embodies Aang, the Avatar himself. With his serene strength and ultimate goal of peace, Zenyatta as Aang is your ultimate ally in bringing balance to every fight.   Mei as Katara: The wisdom and fluidity of the Water Tribe are reflected in Mei’s Katara skin. Unlock this cosmetic by completing special in-game challenges. Whether freezing enemies in their tracks or leading your team to victory, Mei as Katara will always fight with the waterbender’s calm determination.   Genji as Zuko: Harness the unrelenting fire of the Fire Nation with Genji as Zuko. This fierce skin captures Zuko’s resilience and undeniable skill. Genji’s speed and deadly precision paired with Zuko’s fiery spirit make this a must-have for your collection.   Orisa as Appa: Appa fans, rejoice! Orisa brings the loyal guardian of Team Avatar to life in the most lovable way possible. With her hulking presence and steadfast armor, she’s the ultimate protector your team can count on. Don’t forget to shout “yip yip!” as you carry your teammates to victory.   Kiriko as Suki: Honoring the unyielding leadership and strength of the Kyoshi Warriors, Kiriko’s Suki skin is all about loyalty, skill, and teamwork. Lead your team with confidence, just as Suki would.   Venture as Toph: Become an unshakable force of nature with Venture sporting Toph’s earthbending persona. This cosmetic highlights Toph’s raw strength and unflinching determination, showing enemies that you mean business (especially if they don’t see it coming).   The Overwatch 2 art team had a blast while creating these skins. “As big fans, it was tough to choose which characters to create skins for,” says art director Dion Rogers. “But we immediately knew Orisa would be Appa, Aang’s sky bison. This skin helped us blend Overwatch’s futuristic elements with Avatar’s mystical/eastern designs. Though we joked about temporarily increasing her size, we kept her in-game scale unchanged.” He goes on to the difficulty is choosing a hero perfect for one of Avatar’s most famous characters: “For Aang, we considered a few other heroes, including Illari due to her ultimate resembling the “Avatar State,” but ultimately chose Zenyatta as Aang, fitting well with his Transcendence ability.”   The Overwatch 2 x Avatar collaboration is packed with goodies, from special unlockable rewards to one-of-a-kind cosmetics. This is your opportunity to embody the Avatar universe while dominating the Overwatch battlefields.   Unlock and Earn skins, such as Mei as Katara by completing exclusive challenges in-game.   Collect Elemental-Themed Cosmetics, capturing the magic of iconic moments and characters from Avatar.   Battle Like the Gaang, bringing harmony and strength to every match.  Each game is an opportunity to channel your inner bender, master the elements, and prove to your enemies why teamwork matters.   Mark your calendars! This crossover event will only be available from December 17 to December 30 in Overwatch 2. Whether you’re an avid Avatar fan or simply love collecting skins, this is your chance to celebrate two legendary universes coming together.   Are you ready to summon the power of Water, Earth, Fire, and Air?
