  "text": "Image credit: SCS Software If you've been itching for an excuse to get back out on the road again - by which I mean to sit in front of the computer playing American Truck Simulator again - there's some good news. Developer SCS Software has announced it's latest state expansion - this one providing access to the highways and byways of Missouri - launches next Thursday, 3rd April. Missouri, if you're not keeping tabs, brings American Truck Simulator's current US state tally up to 17, following on from Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, and Arkansas. It's not the only expansion waiting in the wings, either; SCS has also previously confirmed it's working in Illinois, Iowa, and Lousiana - although these are further out. Anyway, American Truck Simulator's digital rendition of Missouri - AKA the Show Me State - promises \"vibrant cities\", including Saint Louis and its iconic Gateway Arch, as well as \"diverse and beautiful\" vistas, \"from the rolling Ozark hills to charming small towns and vast farmlands.\" American Truck Simulator - Missouri Video Trailer American Truck Simulator - Missouri trailer.Watch on YouTube \"Experience the beauty of Missouri's sunrise and sunset as you drive through this picturesque landscape,\" SCS writes over on Missouris Steam page. \"New depots and underground warehouses typical for this state add depth and realism to your trucking adventures. Engage in the heartbeat of Missouri's agriculture, transporting farm produce amidst fresh crops and rural vibes. Whether you're navigating urban streets in Saint Louis or cruising through serene countryside, Missouri offers a diverse and exciting trucking experience.\" Ahead of Missouri's 3rd April arrival on Steam, SCS has released American Truck Simulator's 1.54 update. This introduces and overhauled cargo system, which the developer says \"improves efficiency [and] saves disk space and memory by eliminating the need to store countless pre-made combinations\", there's a more intuitive truck adjustment system, making it easier to tweak your in-cabin experience. That's on top of NVIDIA PhysX physics implementation, promising \"more precise collision detection results and more robust behaviour during scenarios involving collisions\", plus Driving Academy awards, and more - as detailed in its patch notes.",
