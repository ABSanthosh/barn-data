Of course, you shouldn’t take my complaints about the place too seriously.  My writing about this journey is often an attempt to channel what my character must feel, his thought process, as he travels from place to place doing mundane tasks for every local thane or other poobah while murdering anybody or anything giving him the side eye. For good or ill though, I was ready to pack up my comically large marsh sword, my ghost, Nona, and my emotional baggage and head towards Lothlorien… because holographic Galadriel showed up like Princess Leia and summoned me. Still not even sure which ghost she meant… they’re as common as boars in some parts (Also, I was tempted to draw holo-projector lines from the sword.) Granted, Nona and I had to do a scavenger hunt all the way back to Enedwaith first, finding little bits and pieces of clues and talking to the local wise men and women. Surely this guy out in the wild has some insights Also, my favorite thing about Nona is in her entry on the LOTRO Wiki which points out that, while she claims to be of the Uch-luth, the Ox Clan, she sports the apparel and facial paint/tattoos of the Caru-lûth, the Stag Clan. That is the kind of detail I expect out of this crowd.  The LOTRO playerbase may be a fraction that of WoW, but our Red Shirt Guys are a bigger percentage of the population… which still means we have fewer of them, but still… I had a point in that statement somewhere. Anyway, the quest was of the “travel now” variety, which was good because I had failed to visit Lothlorien previously, having given it and Mirkwood a pass back when I spoke to the old man in scene 24. We showed up in front of Haldir… some people just have one job, and his seems to be to find people who have shown up and guide them to meet the lady of the wood or whatever Galadirel’s stage name is.  I forget. You must remember me! I had lines in the books! There was a bit of walking about and Haldir was selling me on the location like he’s a real estate agent, but we eventually wandered into Galadriel’s garden and everything was in soft focus enough that they must have put a think layer of petroleum jelly on the lens filter and I was about a “chicka chicka waa waa” base line away from wondering if I meant “porn name” rather than “stage name.” But there, in the blurry woods, Galadriel didn’t really have much to say.  Some talk of the dream, but no updates about plans or the state of the war really. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, calm down. Then, out of nowhere, we get a Gandalf walk on moment, and I expect him to go full Troy McClure recalling marks on Weathertop, fireworks in The Shire, and that unfortunate event on the bridge.  But he too seems only interested in my dream, saying that only on the banks of the Great River can I learn the meaning of my dream. Then, as quickly as he showed up, he had to head out, parting on a crack that implies I was perhaps not the top choice on the list for this venture. Wait, what is that supposed to mean? Otherwise, there wasn’t a mention of much else.  Then we were done with Galadriel and out the back door and over the city limits of Lothlorien.  There an attendant met up with us and gave us out parting gifts, which included some cash, xp, a pack of postcards, and a lovely swan fountain to install in my home. Kind of cheap on the silver… some “golden” wood… And then it was into the Great River… the zone that is, not the actual river. A great river indeed I started down the road as directed and followed up with some quests, which included visiting spots along the river where the company might have rested.  It was a fine looking zone, though I couldn’t tell you if it was just a continuation of Lothlorien or new art assets, having been hustled out of the golden wood so quickly. Riding along the river I quickly noticed that the mobs I passed were gray to me.  My stop at the first settlement gave me some quests, but I had out leveled most of them pretty significantly.  I continued along the epic quest line because it was at least sending me to each location with a stable master.  Eventually that became a bit tedious and I ended up just grabbing all the stable master stops. I had started doing that because, despite my hunter travel utility, it was starting to become a bit of a challenge to get back to whatever zone I was working on if I go back to Rivendell or wherever to do something. At one point I paid the mithril coin to go from Rivendell to Lothlorien thinking that would connect me to Stangard on The Great River, it being the main seat of the zone.  However, despite being next door, no such luck.  A wasted coin, for now.  Instead, it turned out that I needed to go to South Bree to find a stable master connection to Stangard. I was wishing for a subway style map of cross regional stable master connections, because it isn’t always obvious as to what locations have connections.  I thought my wish might be granted when I saw that the LOTRO wiki had such a map, but it was a monkey’s paw sort of wish result.  I mean, technically, there is such a map.  It is, however, a bunch of indecipherable green spaghetti laid over the in-game stable master map.  Literally less useful than the EVE Online in-game map. Once I had collected all those connections, I moved on across the zone line and into The Wold, where I finally landed in Rohan for real.  Mounted combat and horse fun awaits.",

me some quests, but I had out leveled most of them pretty significantly.  I continued along the epic quest line because it was at least sending me to each location with a stable master.  Eventually that became a bit tedious and I ended up just grabbing all the stable master stops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had started doing that because, despite my hunter travel utility, it was starting to become a bit of a challenge to get back to whatever zone I was working on if I go back to Rivendell or wherever to do something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one point I paid the mithril coin to go from Rivendell to Lothlorien thinking that would connect me to Stangard on The Great River, it being the main seat of the zone.  However, despite being next door, no such luck.  A wasted coin, for now.  Instead, it turned out that I needed to go to South Bree to find a stable master connection to Stangard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was wishing for a subway style map of cross regional stable master connections, because it isn’t always obvious as to what locations have connections.  I thought my wish might be granted when I saw that the LOTRO wiki \u003ca href=\"https://lotro-wiki.com/wiki/File:Travel_map.png\"\u003ehad such a map\u003c/a\u003e, but it was a monkey’s paw sort of wish result.  I mean, technically, there is such a map.  It is, however, a bunch of indecipherable green spaghetti laid over the in-game stable master map.  Literally less useful than the \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e in-game map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I had collected all those connections, I moved on across the zone line and into The Wold, where I finally landed in Rohan for real.  Mounted combat and horse fun awaits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
