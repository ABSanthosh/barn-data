  "text": "Club Soko is an entry into the recent Crazy Web Game Jam 2024 that gives Sokoban a few modern twists and a cool nightclub theme. Sokoban has been around for ages. Since 1982, in fact; Back when games were on cassettes. Despite it being a formula that’s over 40 years old, people are still churning out Sokoban-style games with fun twists and tweaks – be that thematic or mechanical. Club Soko (from Miracle Tea Studios) is an entry into the Crazy Web Game Jam 2024, which this year had the theme of ‘Everything is a remix’ – that’s the Night Club, complete with club music, explained then. That said, this game is quite clever. For a start, much like most modern Sokoban-style games it abandons the ‘you can only push’ and ‘boxes must be places in specific spots’ in order to conclude the level; Instead it goes for the ‘clear a path’ approach. Gotta make your way across the dance floor, and naturally, nobody wants to get out of your way. That’s where it gets clever, because even though it’s an incredibly short game (as with most jam games) each new level set (represented by a vinyl plucked from a rack) introduces a new mechanic. These range from budgers and shovers to speakers that can be pushed and pulled. Although you might find yourself asking why there are so many speakers in the middle of the dance floor as you play. Well-balanced and carefully introduced mechanics aside, I have to add that both Club Soko‘s audio and artwork are great and perfectly match the theme they’d chosen. Even the fact there’s a title screen and level select menu shows that the team were quick to align on a goal and correctly doled out tasks despite the time limit. Club Soko is available now on the CrazyGames website. About The Author Dann Sullivan After almost a decade of selling games, Dann decided to try his hand at writing about them instead. A few years in and he is the Founder and Editor-in-Chief of Big Boss Battle, where he and his team cover games of all shapes and sizes. When not in the role, he can often be found seeking out small, memorable game experiences.",
