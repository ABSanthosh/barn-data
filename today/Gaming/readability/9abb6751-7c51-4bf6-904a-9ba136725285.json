  "text": "More Defenders are coming to the MCU.Krysten Ritter is officially returning as Jessica Jones for Daredevil: Born Again Season 2.As reported by Variety, news of Ritter’s return as Marvel’s crime-fighting private investigator was revealed during the Disney Upfront presentation in New York today. The confirmation follows months of rumors that the Disney+ show could reunite more than a few of the Netflix Defenders as fans hope to see them make their Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) debut sooner rather than later.Ritter took the stage alongside Daredevil and The Defenders co-star Charlie Cox to express her excitement about the return of Jessica Jones.“It’s so great to be back, returning to Jessica after three seasons and The Defenders and now joining the MCU,” Ritter said. “I’m so excited to bring back this iconic character, and without giving too much away, there is much more in store for Jessica Jones. This is going to be an incredible season!”The 25 Best MCU HeroesRitter first portrayed the New York-based Marvel hero when Jessica Jones Season 1 premiered on Netflix in 2015. Two more seasons eventually followed, as did The Defenders team-up series, but as Netflix’s time with original Marvel programming began to wind down, so too did hopes that Ritter would ever play the character again.That was until 2021, when Disney regained ownership of the rights to certain characters, including Jessica Jones. As Cox was eventually brought back for a brief Spider-Man: No Way Home cameo as well as his own Disney+ show with Daredevil: Born Again, fans began to speculate about how the revival project could serve as a vehicle to reintroduce other Netflix heroes. With Punisher serving a pivotal role in Season 1, it makes sense to see Ritter returning for Season 2.Ritter last played the character in Jessica Jones Season 3, which premiered in 2019. Her tease at the upfront presentation suggests the MCU may see more Jessica Jones in the future, but for now, we can at least expect to see her in Daredevil: Born Again Season 2. Disney has yet to announce a release date, but showrunner Dario Scardapane has told fans to expect more episodes in March 2026.For more, you can read our 8/10 review of the Daredevil revival show’s first season as well as our reviews for Jessica Jones seasons 1, 2, and 3.
