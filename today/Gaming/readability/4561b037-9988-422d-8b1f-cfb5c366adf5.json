Non-current Audible subscribers are eligible for three months of Audible Premium Plus for $0.99 per month. In addition to the three discounted months, you also get a free audiobook of your choice each month that you can keep indefinitely.Note: The fine print says that anyone who does not have a current Audible subscription is eligible. Normally with trials like these, Amazon explicitly states \"current and past\" subscribers aren't eligible. I'm not sure if that means previous Audible members who have let their subscriptions lapse are allowed to get in on this deal. If you're one of those people, there's an easy way to check: After you log into your account, if you see the $0.99 promo banner right on Amazon's Audible page then you're eligible and if you don't then you're not.3 Months of Audible Premium Plus for $0.99 per MonthNon-Current Subscribers Only3 Months of Audible Premium Plus for $0.99 Per MonthSee deal in the UK - £0.99/month for three months (was £7.99)Audible is a subscription service that gives you access to hundreds of thousands of the best audiobooks without ever having to purchase them. There are two paid membership plans: the lower tier Audible Plus ($7.95/mo) and the higher tier Audible Premium Plus ($14.95/mo). The biggest difference between the two is the size of the audiobook library. Whereas Audible Plus only lets you listen to a selection of about 10,000 audiobooks, the Audible Premium Plus plan gives you access to a whopping 500,000 audiobooks. These include all-time classics like Frank Herbert's Dune, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire), The Witcher, The Sandman Series,and The Lord of the Rings.Although the seriously expanded library is the main draw of the Audible Premium Plus membership, there are some other nice perks as well. Every month Premium Plus members get to pick one audiobook to keep in their library indefinitely, even after the membership expires. Also, Premium Plus members can get 30% off any additional audiobooks they wish to purchase in addition to exclusive limited-time discounts.If you were already planning to purchase a couple of audiobooks, then it makes more sense to pay less than $3 to get three audiobooks you get to keep indefinitely and enjoy all the benefits of Audible Premium Plus for three months. This deal only pops up a few times per year (usually only during Prime Day and Black Friday), so don't waste your \"first-time subscriber\" eligibility status on a short 30-day trial.Looking for more free trials?
