  "text": "R.E.P.O. is a co-op experience where you are tasked with sneaking highly breakable trinkets out of a house without breaking them or dying. While haunted houses are, admittedly, filled with all kinds of apparitions and creatures that will try to kill you, they’re also filled with stuff that’s worth a lot of money to the right buyer. So much money that there’s a whole company built around retrieving these items (in as close to mint condition as you can manage). So, it’s well worth hiring six people and sending them in after pianos, vases, and other high price items that are lying around. I mean, if you die, they don’t exactly have to pay you. As the items are only worth full price when they’re in immaculate shape, you’ll need to be careful with them. Weight isn’t an issue as you’ll be picking things up with some sort of sci-fi lifting ray, but the physics system at work in the game means you have to be careful with how you carry it around the various hallways and broken environments (haunted houses aren’t exactly known for being free of clutter). Any bump can decrease the value of the things you’re lugging around, so you will have to be extra careful. This is why R.E.P.O. throws various monsters at you – it’s hard to carefully maneuver a tv around when a massive terrifying clown is dogging you down the halls and firing lethal lasers at you. There are many different creatures that will hunt you as you try to rob these homes, and keeping away from them without breaking the stuff you’re trying to steal turns this into a ridiculous, hilarious experience. Especially so since your in-game robot avatars speak through wiggling their heads and do with an intensity that matches your own screams and laughs. Expect plenty of both if you and some friends pick this game up. R.E.P.O. is available now on Steam Early Access.
