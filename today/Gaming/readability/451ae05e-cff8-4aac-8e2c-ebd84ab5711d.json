Amazon currently has the 8BitDo Pro 2 controller with an official travel case included for 25% off the regular price. This is an excellent controller that works well with retro games thanks to its SNES-inspired design, but also features full grips and thumbsticks that work great with modern games, too. Check out the deal below for more information.8BitDo Pro 2 Controller + Travel Case DealUpgraded Hall Effect Thumbsticks8bitdo Pro 2 Controller (with Travel Case)Like many 8BitDo products, the Pro 2 controller packs a ton of value into a controller for under $50. As the name implies, this is a proper \"pro\" controller with customizable back buttons and remappable buttons in the 8BitDo Ultimate Software app. It's compatible with a variety of systems including Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, iOS, and Android devices.Since our review of the 8BitDo Pro 2 in 2021, the controller has received a major revision with the addition of Hall effect joysticks. This effectively eliminates controller stick drift, improving longevity of the components and making for a smoother experience overall.While Nintendo hasn't outright confirmed whether all Bluetooth-enabled controllers will work with Nintendo Switch 2, it did confirm that the original Switch Joy-Con and Pro Controller are compatible, so it's likely that you'll be able to use the 8BitDo Pro 2, as well.Will tariffs increase the price of 8BitDo controllers?Since 8BitDo's products are manufactured and shipped from China, this may be the best price you'll find on this controller (as well as all other 8BitDo products) for the foreseeable future, as the tariffs on imported Chinese goods have already gone into effect.8BitDo recently halted shipping to the U.S. after blaming U.S. tariffs for the suspension only to later back down and say it will continue shipping to customers. While we don't know for sure if prices will increase, it seems like the most likely outcome down the line.Matthew Adler has written for IGN since 2019 covering all things gaming, tech, tabletop games, and more.
