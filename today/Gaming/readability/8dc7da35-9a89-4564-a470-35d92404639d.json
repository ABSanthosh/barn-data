  "text": "Horror asymmetric multiplayer game Dead by Daylight is celebrating its ninth anniversary later this year, an amount of time so large it really makes you think \"man, most live service devs should have had the foresight to make their game a decade ago, huh?\" With that anniversary approaching imminently, developer Behaviour Interactive held a year nine anniversary broadcast where there was one reveal that'll have you going \"yeah that makes sense\" and another where you'll say \"ok, sure.\" The first one is that Five Nights at Freddy's villain Springtrap is coming to the game as a new killer, an addition that feels so obvious I'm not sure why it's taken this long. It seems like they're taking some cues from the movie for this one, as Matthew Lillard is actually reprising his role as the character from the film adaptation. Details like Springtrap's moveset and a release date are being withheld for an incoming livestream, but there's a legendary outfit planned alongside the Yellow Rabbit version from the film. Oh, and of course there'll be a map based on the Freddy Fazbear's restaurant too. Dead by Daylight | Year 9 Anniversary Broadcast Watch on YouTube Here's the weird one: it's another collaboration, this time with The Witcher of all series. No, you won't be running around as Geralt or anything, it's coming in the form of a few costumes. Survivor Vittorio Toscano is getting an outfit based on Geralt's, with other outfits planned based on characters like Yennefer, Ciri, Triss, and Eredin. This one's just a bit odd! The Witcher games aren't horror, so it just feels a bit like suits swinging around properties they own just because they can. Aside from that, a few other updates are planned throughout the rest of the year, with June seeing a rework of The Archives and adjusted gamma settings, alongside other updates further down the line allowing for more spectators in custom matches, rebalancing for map and key items, and a few other bits and pieces. There's also a new chapter coming in 2026 where you (yes, even you) will be able to take part in a choose-your-own-adventure style activity to vote on different aspects of a new killer and survivor. TLDR: Lots on the way!",
