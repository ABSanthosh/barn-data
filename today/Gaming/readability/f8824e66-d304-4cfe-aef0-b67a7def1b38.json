  "text": "Big Hops sees a frog making creative use of their sticky tongue (and some neat abilities) to platforming through a charming cartoon world. Clearly inspired by Mario Odyssey, Big Hops allows you to explore colorful and vibrant stages filled with interactable puzzles and characters that you can help. Primarily using your tongue, you can swing, complete puzzles, and interact with various objects – it’s a lot of fun. Big Hops has a lot of parkour throughout it. It’s always clear where you should be going next (sometimes by being guided by other characters as you are helping them with quests), but how you get there is up to you. Using your tongue and various gadgets or consumables you find, you can end up finding your own fun way across different areas. The world itself feels massive with so much to discover and explore. The mobility options in the game, from swinging to climbing up walls, makes the movement fun and fast. You can actually find yourself speeding around once you get use to all the ways you can get around! I didn’t get far enough to start using the gadgets that you can get, but throwing items onto walls to then use them to get higher seems like a fun idea! I did get to pick mushrooms and throw them, creating trampolines to get further up cliffs as my climbing was quite limited. These different items made me think differently about the area I was trying to get to. When I played some of Big Hops at Day of the Devs, I really enjoyed the feel of the vibrant world, climbing up towers and jumping off them to help the smaller frog that was exploring around with me. It’s just a joyous game that you can sink hours into exploring as you find more and more to interact with. Big Hops is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
