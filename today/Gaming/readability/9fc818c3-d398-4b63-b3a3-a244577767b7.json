  "text": "Marketplace Written By Cristina Anderca Published 3/28/25 A free DLC inspired by iconic scenes from the film Adventure deeper into the Overworld of A MINERCAFT MOVIE, complete with high-speed races, stealth missions, and waves of hostile mobs! The official A MINERCAFT MOVIE DLC is available now for free at Minecraft Marketplace, and it’s a thrilling journey that you won’t forget anytime soon – nor will the friends you bring along! Dust off that vintage leather jacket, put on your fingerless gloves, and enter the arcade, where you get to hang out with Garrett and play as the heroes from the movie. Go head-to-head with Steve, Dawn, Henry, and Natalie or your friends for the top spot on the leaderboard in three competitive, action-filled mini-games inspired by iconic scenes from the movie. Rumor has it you’ll get a trophy if you beat all the records...  What will it take to win? Get a sneak peek at the three mini-games and see which skills you’ll need to claim the top spot: Elytra race In this game, you get to slap on a pair of elytra wings and enter a high-speed race against characters from the movie or your friends. Dodge obstacles to keep up the pace and collect power-ups to get ahead of the competition. Can you beat Garrett’s world record? You won't know until you try! First night survival Finding yourself in the Overworld for the first time is always a thrill, especially when night falls and waves of hostile mobs start coming at you. Wait a second... that’s a LOT of mobs! This isn’t your average first night in the Overworld... Can you survive the onslaught and beat the high score? Those zombies will try to stop you, but you’ve got this! Mansion stealth How fast can you collect the Earth crystals from the woodland mansion? Evokers, vindicators, and Endermen are on the prowl, and they’ll stop at nothing to keep you from reaching your goal. Put your speed and stealth to the test to traverse the corridors leading to the Earth Crystal chest. With enough practice, you might sneak all the way to the top of the leaderboard... The doors are open, the machines are plugged in, and a world of adventure awaits! Head to Minecraft Marketplace and adventure into A MINECRAFT MOVIE DLC today. See the movie on April 4, only in theaters! Newest News Catch up on the latest Minecraft news \u0026 game updates!",
