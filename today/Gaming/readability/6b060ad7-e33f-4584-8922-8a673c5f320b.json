  "text": "Lindsay Lohan’s third Netflix movie, the second released this year, is out now, and the romcom’s intro credits are melting our brains.Suggested ReadingNetflix's One Piece Live-Action Trailer Has A Treasure Trove Of Anime Easter EggsOffEnglishSuggested ReadingDid you know that Lindsay Lohan has a new Christmas-themed romantic comedy out on Netflix? It’s true. The movie is called Our Little Secret and is about Lindsay Lohan’s character Avery running into her ex-boyfriend during a Christmas gathering with her new boyfriend’s family, and the two of them keeping their past a secret. But who cares about that? Probably not you. So instead, please watch—via Michael Collado on Twitter—the new film’s batshit-wild opening credits which try to condense the past 10 years into about 90 seconds via some wild choices.Here are just some of the events picked by the producers and creators of this movie that they believe help quickly illustrate a decade passing.2014 - ALS Ice Bucket Challenge2015 - Gay marriage being legalized in the United States2016 - Beyond Meat becoming popular2018 - The cave rescue of the Thai soccer team2020 - Bernie Sanders and his viral mittens2022 - King Charles crownedYou might notice a few things missing from the opening credits. For example, while multiple Netflix shows get namedropped (brand synergy!), the massive pandemic that started in 2020 does not. It’s also weird that this timeline starts off with the ALS Bucket Challenge, as that feels like it happened 20 years ago and doesn’t seem like a big enough moment in history to indicate that you are about to do a slideshow of “Here’s what happened over the last 10 years.” And what’s with the Beyond Meat inclusion? Or the reference to the Cybertruck reveal? Are those really on the same level as a new King in England, gay marriage being legalized, or the Notre Dame Cathedral burning down? But perhaps the best part of this wild intro is that at the very end, to identify that we are entering 2023/2024, we get a entry about Taylor Swift’s massively popular concert tour. Except, as pointed out on Twitter, the image used in the movie is of Taylor Swift from 2009 during her “Fearless” tour. Ah well, close enough. .",
