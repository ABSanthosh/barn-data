You’re bound to run into more individuals as you explore the different locations, but these seem to be the prime highlights and may play a major role in the storyline.  Every GTA 6 Character Revealed So Far Based on official information, the following characters have been revealed so far:  Jason Duval Lucia Caminos  Cal Hampton Boobie Ike  Dre’Quan Priest Real Dimez (Bae-Luxe and Roxy) Raul Bautista  Brian Heder Jason Duval \u0026 Lucia Caminos Image by Rockstar Jason and Lucia are the two protagonists that you can control in GTA 6. Both these characters have a troubled history individually and are definitely up to no good together. Expect some Bonnie \u0026 Clyde-style adventure as these two individuals tear up Leonida, leaving nothing but destruction in their wake.  Cal Hampton Image by Rockstar Cal Hampton fills Lester’s role in the previous title in the franchise. He’s a hacker who loves snooping on official police chatter. He seems to have a laid-back personality and is content with where he is in life, but Jason’s exploits might pull him into something more serious and dangerous.  Boobie Ike  Image by Rockstar Boobie Ike is a local Vice City legend and owns a recording studio, a strip club and a lot of other real estate. Although he’s considered legitimate, he has a considerable influence on Vice City and how things are done there.  Dre’Quan Priest Image by Rockstar Dre’Quan used to be a hustler, but he’s now associated with a record label. He’s still looking to branch out and grow above the rest while trying to work his way up through the music industry, especially in Vice City.  Real Dimez (Bae-Luxe and Roxy) Image by Rockstar Bae-Luxe and Roxy are social media starlets who shot to fame after working with popular rapper DWNPLY. However, fame didn’t last long, and they’re now signed to Only Raw Records, looking for another shot at fame.  Raul Bautista  Image by Rockstar Raul Bautista is a seasoned bank robber who’s always on the hunt for more thrills. He’s known to be reckless and is bound to get almost everyone into trouble. If there are any bank heists in GTA 6, then Raul is the one who’ll teach you the ropes to go about it.  Brian Heder Image by Rockstar Brain Heder is an old drug runner who currently smuggles drugs into the city on his boats. He also lets Jason live for free at one of his properties as long as he helps him collect debts from others.  For now, these are the only characters Rockstar has revealed. We’ll update this piece if the developers reveal information about more characters joining the roster in the future.  The Escapist is supported by our audience.
