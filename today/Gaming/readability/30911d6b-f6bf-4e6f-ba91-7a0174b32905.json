And mentally, he definitely feels like he has the weight of the world on his shoulders as he tries to heal every single person who shows up at his door. And emotionally, well, clearly there’s lingering pain from his not-quite-a-breakup from his longtime research partner, Jayce. However even though Viktor is suffering, I gotta say… he’s really hot when he’s miserable.Let’s get this out of the way: what I think is hot in a fictional setting is NOT what I think is hot in real life, blah blah blah. I’m not condoning becoming Hextech Jesus or being so tortured about the burden of evolution, humanity, and your place in it that you start a cult. I just simply think the more he suffers, the sexier he gets.It doesn’t help that the first few scenes of Viktor this season were him basically naked, with nothing but a sheet draped around him. Yes, yes, he has a freaky robot body now, but hear me out: I’m into that. I’m also into his hair getting scragglier and longer and his general demeanor just becoming wearier and more tired. He’s hurting! But by god, he makes it look good. I’ve always had a soft spot for Viktor, who’s probably my favorite male character on the show. He’s the quieter juxtaposition to Jayce’s bravado, and has more baggage weighing on his slender shoulders in a way that makes his character super compelling to me personally. I like that he desperately wants to change the world, but he’s continually shafted and running out of time. In this season, all of that is amplified. He has greater and grander power than ever before; but as we’ve learned, there’s a cost to it. Still, he’s resigned to his mission. He will help. No matter the cost. It’s clearly taking a toll on him in every possible way, but man, if that drive and desperation ain’t sexy. Now, again: things aren’t looking so great. After, all this most recent batch of episodes did end with Viktor, uh, dead — killed by Jayce, no less (how deliciously tragique!!!). But hey, the show’s been going hard on the Jesus imagery with him (not to mention, he’s a playable champion in League of Legends, so there’s some precedent to him not dying entirely), so I’m fairly confident that he will rise again. And I’ll be there waiting and twirling my hair when he does.",
