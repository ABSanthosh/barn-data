As pointed out by Radec on X (via VGC), when you start up your PlayStation 5, you are greeted with the original booting screen from the PlayStation 1. Also, you can customize the home screen to have design and sound effects that reflect the PS1, PS2, PS3, or PS4 era.

However, the fact the PlayStation 1 and 2 ones, in addition to the 30th Anniversary option, obscure so much is a failure on Sonyâ€™s part. It should have tested them out more before releasing them for public use. At least the beeps and boops from past consoles provide some retro comfort. If you are still pining for the days when Sony treated the PlayStation brand better, you can check out a cool history lesson on its official website. You can view a thank you video from the company on YouTube, too. Marvel over when Naughty Dog was allowed to make games outside of The Last of Us franchise. Iâ€™m hoping the 30th anniversary celebration leads to more classic games being added to Sonyâ€™s digital storefront. There are so many Ratchet and Clank titles I never played!
