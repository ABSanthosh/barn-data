  "text": "Written By Cristina Anderca Published 6/3/25 A new collection to boost your adventures in-game and out Adventuring solo may be brave, but is it convenient? Rarely. Pros: Solitude, (almost) zero arguments over loot, the absence of pranks. Cons: I have to do everything myself – even provide the musical entertainment! It’s not good. While they may not sing, the companions in the free adidas Adventurers add-on* do pretty much everything else, including rewarding you with lootboxes containing collectible adidas armor! Meet the Coach, the Teammate, and the Mascot. Every adventure needs a sidekick, and these three companions are ready to help you face whatever your adventures may bring. A horde of zombies? No problem. Need to find a village ASAP? You got it. It’s all about teamwork! And the awesome gear, of course. Speaking of gear… The adidas x Minecraft collection For your IRL journeys, we’ve teamed up with adidas to create a new collection inspired by iconic mobs, including T-shirts, shorts, tracksuits, and sneakers in sizes for kids and teens. Check out these limited-edition designs at adidas.com/minecraft. The adidas Adventurers add-on* With the adidas Adventurers add/on, each companion will grant you a passive effect, like damage or Haste buffs, hunger prevention, and lava protection. Choose your companion based on your plans; for example, if you’re planning a building marathon, the mascot will keep your hunger level stable, so you don’t have to take snack breaks. In-game, that is! IRL snack and stretch breaks and highly encouraged. Secondly, the adidas Adventurers also offer you some active abilities to choose from. The Coach can help you see ore blocks by highlighting them and even teleport you, the Mascot will gather crops or find items for you, and the Teammate will fight mobs alongside you. The coach can even give you a huge jump boost if you have elytra wings equipped, so you can start gliding from anywhere! That’s right, no more sprinting up the nearest hill or building dirt columns for the perfect takeoff. Finally, when you interact with the coach, you can also access the Quest List. Here, you can find various milestones that you can reach together with your companions, like the distance you’ve run or swam or the amount of mobs you’ve defeated.  Every time you hit a milestone, you’ll receive an adidas lootbox with a random item inside! Blue lootboxes contain a random Minecraft item, while gold lootboxes contain adidas armor with various stylish designs that you can collect. This gear acts as functional armor, is enchantable, and gives you special powers on top of looking incredibly cool! The powers vary from water breathing to damage reflection, super jump, and many more. The adidas Bucket Hat will even let you see better when you’re submerged in lava! It won’t make you fireproof, though, so plan before you cannonball into a lake of fire. Team up. Game on! You can get the adidas Adventurers add-on* for free at Minecraft Marketplace, and the footwear collection is also out now at adidas.com. No matter your playstyle, the companions will do their best to get you out of a bind or take your adventures to new heights – even literally!  *Requires Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (sold separately) with access to the internet and Minecraft Marketplace.
