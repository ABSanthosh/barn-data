Jack Black is everywhere in pop gaming culture lately, and will even make another appearance (well, technically two) in next month’s Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake. Black will reprise his role as Officer Dick, in addition to voicing Constable Richard, Dick’s UK counterpart, in the game’s London level.As a child, Dick, real name Richard Ennvee, “was mocked by other skaters and called a ‘poser,’” according to an Activision press release. “Overtaken by the need for revenge, Dick vowed to one day become what those skaters feared most - the long arm of the law!” Although the good constable doesn’t get as much of a lore drop, he is promised to be “every bit as hard-nosed and utterly ridiculous as Officer Dick.”For those who don’t remember the officer from the older games, he’s been an unlockable character in the franchise since the original game, and remained as such until Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3. He returned in Tony Hawk’s Project 8 and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD before making an appearance in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 as Jables himself.In Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4, Black joins Doom Slayer, TMNT’s Michelangelo, and Bam Margera among the roster of playable characters. No stranger to gaming (he was the lead in Double Fine’s 2009 hit Brütal Legend), Jack Black has been a visible face in recent high-profile gaming-themed projects. He’s the voice of Bowser in the Mario movies, the voice of Claptrap in the box office bomb Borderlands, and the face of the billion-dollar live-action hit Minecraft. And this summer, he’ll make funky faces and jokes in a Tony Hawk game.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 is out July 11 for Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.",
