  "text": "Dev Blog #1: The Journey Begins! Hey everyone! Welcome to the first dev blog for Grapple Slayer, a project that I’ve been super excited to share with you all. This is a side-scrolling game inspired by Idle Slayer, with an intense twist: a grappling hook mechanic that lets you slay giant monsters, in a style reminiscent of Attack on Titan. I’ve only been working on this for a few days, but I’m pumped about where the game is heading and wanted to give you a peek into its early development.​ Keeping the Runner Genre Alive I know the runner genre might not be at its peak anymore, but I believe there’s still a lot of love for it, especially when mixed with fresh mechanics. Grapple Slayer blends the traditional endless running style with dynamic combat, platforming, and RPG progression system. I want to add layers of depth, like quests, unlockable items, and other features that give players a reason to keep coming back. I’m hoping this combination works, and I can’t wait to hear your thoughts as I continue developing it. Core Gameplay Mechanics So Far Here's what I’ve got working at the moment: Jumping \u0026 Combat: Players can jump, perform melee attacks, and shoot a bow. Grappling Hook: The star of the show – the player can shoot a grappling hook to latch onto titans and use it to slingshot into a powerful attack. This will be key in taking down the huge monsters that serve as bosses in the game. ​What’s Next Looking ahead, I’m focusing on implementing RPG progression mechanics, where players can take on quests, find items, and upgrade their character to unlock new abilities and equipment. Also I need to work on the grappling hook mechanics and making sure they feel fluid and satisfying. After that, I’ll be moving on to fleshing out more enemies, level designs, and, of course, titans. Thanks for checking out the first dev blog for Grapple Slayer! It’s still early days, but I’m really excited about what’s to come, and I hope you are too. I’d love to hear your feedback and thoughts on the direction of the game so far. Until next time. It's very early to offer feedback, but I like the general idea. Autorunners are an essential part of gaming, especially on mobile, so it's definitely interesting to see what new elements and direction can be added to the genre. Thanks for the feedback, Sebgo! I agree—autorunners are still a big part of gaming, especially on mobile. I’m really excited about the grappling hook mechanic (one of my first game was built around that). It brings new movement into the mix, letting players swing, attack from above, and navigate in ways traditional runners don’t offer. I think this kind of verticality, combined with RPG elements like quests and upgrades, can add something fresh to the genre. It’s been a busy week balancing work and this side project, and since I’m working on this in my free time, things are moving slower than I’d like—but I’m making steady progress. New Additions: Monsters and Early Progress Design Since the last update, I’ve added a couple of new enemies. There are now rats scurrying around and some flying creeps that should add some variety to the starting level. ​ ​ I’ve been experimenting with converting 3D models into pixel art. However, the results so far haven’t been as good as I hoped. I’m looking for an efficient and affordable solution, and I’m open to suggestions! If any of you know a good method for creating consistent pixel art or have recommendations for pixel artists, feel free to share your thoughts. Your input would be greatly appreciated! I’ve also started working on the quest system, which will be a key part of the RPG progression. Right now, it’s still pretty basic, but it lays the foundation for more complex objectives and rewards as the game evolves. You’ll be able to take on quests, find items, and unlock abilities that keep the experience fresh and exciting. ​ Thanks for reading, I’d love to hear your thoughts. What can you envision for the fights and interactions with the titans? I have a few ideas in mind, but I’m sure you have some great suggestions as well. Until next time! AltsKev and sebgo like this. Where can we read your dev blog if the forum closes? AltsKev and sebgo like this. That’s a really good question. I’ll need to think about it since I don’t really use social media much. My personal website could work as a devblog, but it definitely needs some work before it’s ready. I’ll make sure to add a link to it next time I post something Patreon Silver Hi, I've been working on the TouchArcade community Discord server. We have an upcoming games forum channel there which would be a perfect place to park a thread like this one, and you can even apply the \"Devlog\" tag to it. We'd love to have you!
