  "text": "Path of Exile II landed in Early Access Friday on a variety of platforms, including Steam for PC players.  The title, which promises to be free to play, will cost you at least $30 if you want to get in this early access period. Path of Exile 2 I was actually getting this post ready on Thursday when another free to play title showed up on my radar, also charging users for early access, which really irked me.  That was CCP’s announcement of its access plan for EVE Frontier. I wrote a fairly scathing review of where that game stands… and what it stands for… a post that pretty much got crickets as a response.  It got a couple comments here and on Blue Sky, but only from people already somewhat vested in the drama of CCP trying to be something beyond the company that made EVE Online.  The whole story was a small pebble tossed in the ocean when it comes to impact. There is almost a story in that, in the fact that in trying to hide from the blockchain crypto core of the game and eschewing some of the worst practices of the “Web3” video game movement, they have failed to ignite their most likely fan base.  The crypto bros are not pining for EVE Frontier most likely because it isn’t obviously a scam where the early adopters will be able to to fleece the late comers and cash out.  That fan base expects a white paper with connect the dots levels of instructions on how to get rich quick.  The greater fool fallacy aspect of crypto is not being highlighted. Crypto gaming fans don’t actually want a game?  Who knew?  I mean, besides from everybody due to the evidence being absolutely overwhelming. Anyway, that is obviously still percolating, rent free, in my brain.  And I don’t want to get too derailed.  But I also find the contrast between my reactions to the two ostensibly free to play titles and their early access buy-in requirements.  Is Path of Exile 2 getting me irked as much as EVE Frontier? If not, why not? I mean the parallels are there, right down to the price points for early access.  Look at EVE Frontier, which is offering a $10 discount at each tier because the really want people to pony up something, anything. Take our quiz: What kind of idiot are you? Then look at Path of Exile 2 and its price points. Path of Exile 2 early access pack pricing Eerily familiar, right? Granted, I suspect there is some industry logic where they have convinced themselves that $30, $60, and $100… all minus a penny… are the magic price points that they dare not mess with.  I have run into similar shamanistic beliefs often in my Silicon Valley career, obvious agreed upon “rules” that nobody has any hard evidence to back up save for the fact that other people have done it. Which isn’t to say those are bad price points, but they are also obviously familiar ones.  And sometimes the pricing shaman is right, that the traditions must be respected. Again, tangent.  I am so bad about that. Anyway, I am irked by EVE Frontier over multiple things.  There is, obviously, the blockchain scam aspect that CCP has been actively trying to suppress… possibly to their detriment it seems.  But there is also the whole “closed alpha” aspect of it… which is to say that there isn’t a game really there yet.  I am fine with that with Stars Reach, which I have written about quite a bit here.  And you can argue about whether or not there is some quid pro quo, that I somehow got access because I write about what I play, but Raph wasn’t standing there at the door looking for $30 to get in and test the new title. Finally, there is the pig in a poke aspect to EVE Frontier, in that nobody can really describe the core game play loop… or fears to do so.  Hilmar gets up there with his crazy allusions and vision and mild manias and absolutely fails to paint a picture for potential players in the way that Chris Roberts or even Brad McQuaid could.  CCP asking me for $30 for a access to a game… a free to play game… when they can’t even communicate what it is.  That probably irks most of all.  There is a possible world where I might get over the blockchain aspect if the game was compelling, but the trip between where we are now and that world is long and arduous and CCP hasn’t put in the work. Okay, enough about CCP and their blockchain.  Why am I not kicking up a fuss about Path of Exile 2 effectively doing the same thing… if you pull back far enough and squint your eyes tightly so you can only see “charging for access to a free to play title” and the price points? Because I know what Grinding Gear Games is offering.  I mean, I pretty much know exactly what they have on tap, which is a new version of Path of Exile built on the foundation of what they learned and the mistakes they made over the last decade or so.  Being early to the party to get in on that… in another mood I might be there. Financial Supporters get Early Access… good for them “Path of Exile only better” is a pretty strong case because Path of Exile was a pretty strong entry into the genre.  Also, they are totally not trying to obscure what they are doing or asking people not to call it an ARPG or a “Diablo-type” or a “clicky killy” or whatever term of art your favorite video game pundit uses. As such, I am not particularly worked up about the fact that Grinding Gear Games is charging for Early Access.  If their super fans (the count of which apparently exceeds 1 million) want to get in early and pay for the privileged, that is okay I guess.  Hell, the price points on Steam aren’t even the limit.  If you are a super whale-sized fan, you can give more with some additional packages over on their site. The liberator of cash from whales package – $480 But, aside from an early crack at the game, that doesn’t give them any inherent advantage.  People with special forum badges still say dumb things and get ignored like the rest of us. They will work out the day one problems and, later, when it is free to play, I will give it a try. They do have to fund the title, which is a notoriously tricky business with free to play when you don’t want to sell power or an “I win” button.  They have to make it a viable business for it to carry on.  It primarily means that I won’t be playing now… but so what? I am more interested in the flexibility of the concept of Early Access.  The fact that the term now covers the idea of paying for a game that will eventually be free to play shows that its meaning is slipping the way every other genre defining word tends to.  What does MMORPG mean?  How about MMO?  Is ARPG well defined?  It was at one point, but now I am not so sure. If we all spoke German we would create a new compound noun for this specific situation that might literally translate as something like “Free to play video game time when you must pay.”  And that would be different from “video game for sale to people who want to test it for a discount over the eventual price” and “video game for sale because company needs cash flow and it isn’t done yet and the moment it is done there will be a Steam sale where it will be cheaper and you will be angry” and so on. But English is always so heavy on context… I mean, the phrase “I feel like pizza” is not about my texture in any way, yet if I say that around noon or in the evening you know what I mean… that we just say things based on meanings assigned solely in our brains.  I mean, we’re just baby steps from being complete “Shaka, when the walls fell” level of idiomatic communications here.  This is probably why that Connections game is so frustrating yet compelling.  It involves figuring out a context that exists for somebody else. So roll on Path of Exile 2 and those who bought in… and a lot of people bought in it seems as I have seen a bunch about server queues and the like… I can wait.  I am interested in the way I am in most things in the fantasy ARPG clicky genre. The original Path of Exile was one of a trio of games I declared were vying for the crown of successor to Diablo II.  And way back then, I did declare that PoE came the closest to the brooding atmosphere of light and shadow that made up so much the vibe from D2. The problem was that PoE had a lot of playability teething pains.  It started off well enough, but the server lag demons would set upon you… especially if you were a melee character, and I am almost always a melee character… and spoiled, for me at least, what looked to be a promising title.  Life goes on. The game improved and expanded and the lag went away, but coming back years and many updates later found me in a confusing morass of options that left me feeling left behind.  So I never quite made it a game I played.  But I can’t really be sore about that as I also never spent any money on it… not even when it was in whatever we now call Early Access today.  I played me some pre-release PoE for free. So if some people want to pay to help polish up what is expected to be a solid entry in the genre, good on them.  Help them figure out the problems before I show up.  I have other things to play in the mean time and those who do pay are at least getting something for their money.  Don’t make me start in on certain Kickstarter titles that are have let milestones lapse for a decade. TL;DR – Path of Exile 2 is probably good, free to play requires somebody to pay, Early Access is a meaningless phrase, and Belghast has all the juicy game details if you’re interested.",

could.  CCP asking me for $30 for a access to a game… a free to play game… when they can’t even communicate what it is.  That probably irks most of all.  There is a possible world where I might get over the blockchain aspect if the game was compelling, but the trip between where we are now and that world is long and arduous and CCP hasn’t put in the work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, enough about CCP and their blockchain.  Why am I not kicking up a fuss about \u003cem\u003ePath of Exile 2\u003c/em\u003e effectively doing the same thing… if you pull back far enough and squint your eyes tightly so you can only see “charging for access to a free to play title” and the price points?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I know what Grinding Gear Games is offering.  I mean, I pretty much know exactly what they have on tap, which is a new version of \u003cem\u003ePath of Exile\u003c/em\u003e built on the foundation of what they learned and the mistakes they made over the last decade or so.  Being early to the party to get in on that… in another mood I might be there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_125419\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

pretty strong case because \u003cem\u003ePath of Exile\u003c/em\u003e was a pretty strong entry into the genre.  Also, they are totally not trying to obscure what they are doing or asking people not

fact that Grinding Gear Games is charging for Early Access.  If their super fans (the count of which apparently exceeds 1 million) want to get in early and pay for the privileged, that is okay I guess.  Hell, the price points on Steam aren’t even the limit.  If you are a super whale-sized fan, you can give more with some additional packages \u003ca

any inherent advantage.  People with special forum badges still say dumb things and get ignored like the rest of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey will work out the day one problems and, later, when it is free to play, I will give it a try. They do have to fund the title, which is a notoriously tricky business with free to play when you don’t want to sell power or an “I win” button.  They have to make it a viable business for it to carry on.  It primarily means that I won’t be playing now… but so what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am more interested in the flexibility of the concept of Early Access.  The fact that the term now covers the idea of paying for a game that will eventually be free to play shows that its meaning is slipping the way every other genre defining word tends to.  What does MMORPG mean?  How about MMO?  Is ARPG well defined?  It was at one point, but now I am not so sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we all spoke German we would create a new compound noun for this specific situation that might literally translate as something like “Free to play video game time when you must pay.”  And that would be different from “video game for sale to people who want to test it for a discount over the eventual price” and “video game for sale because company needs cash flow and it isn’t done yet and the moment it is done there will be a Steam sale where it will be cheaper and you will be angry” and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut English is always so heavy on context… I mean, the phrase “I feel like pizza” is not about my texture in any way, yet if I say that around noon or in the evening you know what I mean… that we just say things based on meanings assigned solely in our brains.  I mean, we’re just baby steps from being complete “Shaka, when the walls fell” level of idiomatic communications here.  This is probably why that \u003cem\u003eConnections\u003c/em\u003e game is so frustrating yet compelling.  It involves figuring out a context that exists for somebody else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo roll on \u003cem\u003ePath of Exile 2\u003c/em\u003e and those who bought in… and a lot of people bought in it seems as I have seen a bunch about server queues and the like… I can wait.  I am interested in the way I am in most things in the fantasy ARPG clicky genre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original \u003cem\u003ePath of Exile\u003c/em\u003e was one of a trio of games I declared were vying for the crown of successor to \u003cem\u003eDiablo II\u003c/em\u003e.  And way back then, I did declare that \u003cem\u003ePoE\u003c/em\u003e came the closest to the brooding atmosphere of light and shadow that made up \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2011/12/15/path-of-exile-and-that-diablo-ii-vibe/\"\u003eso much the vibe\u003c/a\u003e from \u003cem\u003eD2\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem was that \u003cem\u003ePoE\u003c/em\u003e had a lot of playability teething pains.  It started off well enough, but the server lag demons would set upon you… especially if you were a melee character, and I am almost always a melee character… and spoiled, for me at least, what looked to be a promising title.  Life goes on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game improved and expanded and the lag went away, but coming back years and many updates later found me in a confusing morass of options that left me feeling left behind.  So I never quite made it a game I played.  But I can’t really be sore about that as I also never spent any money on it… not even when it was in whatever we now call Early Access today.  I played me some pre-release \u003cem\u003ePoE\u003c/em\u003e for free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo if some people want to pay to help polish up what is expected to be a solid entry in the genre, good on them.  Help them figure out the problems before I show up.  I have other things to play in the mean time and those who do pay are at least getting something for their money.  Don’t make me start in on certain Kickstarter titles that are have let milestones lapse for a decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTL;DR – \u003cem\u003ePath of Exile 2\u003c/em\u003e is probably good, free to play requires somebody to pay, Early Access is a meaningless phrase, and Belghast has \u003ca href=\"https://aggronaut.com/\"\u003eall the juicy game details\u003c/a\u003e if you’re interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
