It’s impossible to keep up with everything hitting the digital space, whether it be Premium Video on Demand (PVOD) or a traditional streaming network. With that in mind, we figured it was well past time for us to whip up a little something to help you keep up (and catch up) with all there is to watch in the big, wide world of digital viewing. And thus, the Streaming Rewind was born! We’ll update this list at the end of each week so you can check out what you may have missed, and what’s coming up on the weekend. We’ll keep it a mix of popular releases and noteworthy lesser-known titles to help you find what’s worth taking the risk on as well as dive into a few things that we loved and why we loved ‘em, or just break down a show or movie that left us with some opinions. Sometimes, we’ll even have guest entries from other members of the IGN staff. If you’re not interested in all that and just want to see a bulleted list of what’s out there, pop on down to the New and Noteworthy and ICYMI sections.Another Simple Favor (Prime Video)Against all odds, best frenemies Emily Nelson (Blake Lively) and Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick) have reunited in Another Simple Favor. Rather than getting the theatrical treatment that Paul Feig’s first foray into Emily and Stephanie’s world did, Another Simple Favor heads straight to Prime Video. While there have been good streaming original films, this one unfortunately feels more like a made-for-TV movie. But, if you had fun on these ladies’ first misadventure in A Simple Favor, you’ll probably enjoy the ride this time too. The Walking Dead: Dead City Season 2 (AMC) I am incapable of giving an educated opinion on the content of this series, as I broke up with The Walking Dead nearly a decade ago. However, what I can say is that The Walking Dead: Dead City’s absolutely unhinged premise of Maggie and Negan teaming up with one another for any reason whatsoever does intrigue me in a way that did at least make me curious about the franchise again for the first time in that decade. For those who are unfamiliar, Negan very famously slaughters Maggie’s husband in the most violent way possible. And now they’re hanging out together!The Four Seasons (Netflix) Do you have friends that you love enough to go on a vacation with once a quarter? What if those friends included Tina Fey, Colman Domingo, Steve Carrell and Will Forte? Tina Fey’s remake of the 1981 film with the same name has its ups and downs, but if the idea of a friend breaking up with another friend and then bringing along a much younger partner on your next vacation in front of their ex makes you cringe in the funny kind of way, you might have fun with Netflix’s recent original New and Noteworthy This Week: Drop, April 29 — Digital and demandDeath of a Unicorn, April 29 — Digital and demandAnother Simple Favor, May 1 — Prime VideoThe Four Seasons, May 1 — NetflixRust, May 1 — Digital and demandStar Wars: Tales of the Underworld, May 4 — Digital and demandThe Walking Dead: Dead City, May 4 — AMC \u0026 AMC+ICYMI: If you had too much going on last week, here are some of the notable things that premiered or debuted on streaming and digital that you may have missed.Andor, April 22 — Disney+Ash, April 22 — Digital and demandYou Season 5, April 24 — NetflixFreaky Tales, April 25 — Digital and demandFréwaka, April 25 — ShudderHavoc, April 25 — NetflixIn This Article",
