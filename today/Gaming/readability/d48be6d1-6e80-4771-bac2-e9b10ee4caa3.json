  "text": "After appearing blank in earlier images. Image credit: Eurogamer/Nintendo Of all the mysteries still surrounding Switch 2, its rumoured 'C' button is perhaps the most enigmatic. Not least because when Nintendo finally revealed its Switch successor earlier this year, there was a conspicuously blank square where everyone was expecting a 'C' button to be. Now, though, with Switch 2's full reveal just a week away, the 'C' has finally, quietly been confirmed in an official image for the newly announced Nintendo Today mobile app. Reports of a Switch 2 'C' button first emerged prior to Nintendo's official reveal, with various leaks indicating it would be situated below the 'home' button on the console's right-hand Joy-Con. And a button mostly fitting that description did eventually show up when Switch 2's hardware design was finally unveiled in January - albeit minus the 'C'. But now the 'C' is official. During Nintendo's latest Direct showcase, the company unveiled its new calendar-style Nintendo Today news app. And an accompanying App Store and Google Play promotional image just so happened to include a picture of Switch 2 - now with its mysterious Joy-Con button firmly emblazoned with its long-rumoured 'C': Image credit: Eurogamer/Nintendo Of course, confirmation of the 'C' doesn't get us any closer to solving the mystery of what the button actually does. Some have speculated the 'C' is merely a nod to GameCube's 'C' button, itself an evolution of the yellow 'C' buttons on N64. But others have suggested the 'C' stands for more than just the first letter of the alphabet not already taken by other buttons on Switch 2. The internet's wildest theories - what does Switch 2's 'C' Button Do?Watch on YouTube Some, for instance, have reasoned it could stand for 'Cast' if Nintendo was considering some sort of streaming functionality for the console, or perhaps 'Chat' in the event it's planning more robust social features for its Switch successor. There've even been rumours it stands for 'Campus', claimed to be an evolution of Wii U's much-loved Miiverse. Alternatively, it could be a button to activate Switch 2's leaked mouse functionality, with the 'C' not actually standing for anything at all. Or perhaps it'll summon Fire Emblem's Chrom to have a little wink at you. Whatever the now officially 'C'd button does, all will likely be revealed next week when Nintendo's hugely anticipated Switch 2-focused Direct airs. It all kicks off at 2pm next Wednesday, 2nd April, in the UK. And needless to say, Eurogamer will 'C' you there.",
