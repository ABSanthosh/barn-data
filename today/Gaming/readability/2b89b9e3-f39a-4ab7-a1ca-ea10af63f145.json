  "text": "SummaryExplore nine vibrant planets with just a pickaxe, axe, and sword – expand territories hex by hex.Harvest resources, unlock new worlds, and defend against alien threats.Team up with four-player local co-op to explore your universe together. In My Little Universe, you’re the architect of your own cosmos. Armed with three trusty tools (pickaxe, axe, and sword), you’ll brave nine unique planets, each filled with mysteries, resources, and monstrous threats. Every hex of land you summon unlocks new biomes – from misty grottos to towering mountains – each holding secrets and challenges waiting to be uncovered. Here the trees regrow faster than you can chop them, sharks have a personal vendetta against swimmers, and that broken spaceship of yours isn’t as useless as it looks. Whether you’re a lone explorer or teaming up with friends, these essential tips will transform you from a clueless castaway into a universe-dominating pro. Booster Cards \u0026 the Art of Cosmic Privilege Think of Booster Cards as your golden tickets to bending the rules of the universe. Every action – mining, chopping, or smacking enemies – brings you closer to unlocking these game-changing perks. Want to swim like a torpedo? There’s a card for that. Prefer enemies to ignore you until you strike first? That’s an option too. Just remember: death (or those overzealous sharks) will strip them away, so use them wisely. And speaking of death – don’t stress. Unlike most survival games, My Little Universe treats your demise like a quick coffee break. You’ll respawn instantly, keeping all your resources and upgrades. The only penalty? Losing one random Booster Card. So if you’ve stacked three incredible buffs, maybe rethink that lava dive. Secrets, Shortcuts, and That Suspicious Spaceship Early players make one critical mistake: ignoring their wrecked starter ship. Big oversight. Once you’ve found your tools, use a pickaxe against that “useless” hunk of junk and see what happens. Trust us – it’s worth the effort. Meanwhile, keep an eye out for resource piles scattered around planets. These freebies are a lifesaver when you’re short on materials. And if you’re drowning in wood but desperate for coins, track down the mysterious trader NPC. He’s your go-to guy for resource swaps. Don’t forget to collect twinkling stars – they unlock flashy cosmetics. Bosses, Sharks, and Other Bad Decisions Let’s get one thing straight: you can’t block attacks. Dodging is your best friend. Master the timing, and you’ll dance through enemy strikes like a space-faring ninja. Mess up? No worries – your health regenerates automatically after a few seconds. Now, about those sharks. Sure, you could attempt an early swim to distant islands. But the universe loves punishing overconfidence. Get eaten and kiss your Booster Card goodbye. Pro tip: Swim faster than your co-op partner. It’s every explorer for themselves. Super Pro Tip: you can catch a shark! Bosses? They’re no joke. A Level 1 sword will make fights feel like a dental appointment. Upgrade to Level 5, and you’ll slice through enemies like a cosmic blender. Same goes for tools—higher tiers mine twice as fast. Prioritize upgrades unless you enjoy watching progress bars crawl. Co-Op Chaos: Teamwork or Betrayal? Playing with friends? Shared resources and universal upgrades mean you’ll blaze through planets – when you’re not sabotaging each other. Assign roles: one mines, one fights, and one “volunteers” as shark bait. For an extra challenge, toggle Manual Controls in the settings. Now every action – chopping, mining, dodging – requires precise button presses. Suddenly, spiders feel like personal enemies, and mining becomes a rhythm game. The Credits Trick (No Waiting Required) Unlike most games, you don’t have to beat My Little Universe to uncover its secrets. Head to the Credits section in the menu anytime – there’s more there than just a list of names. My Little Universe is out now on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Windows PC. Go above and beyond the cosmos! The universe is vast and filled with adventures, mysteries to solve, and enemies to fight… who knows, you might even meet a few friendly faces along the way. Better yet, invite up to three of your friends to join you in the split-screen local co-op mode because it’s always more exciting with friends! EXPLORE! 9 mythical worlds and 65+ different dungeons, from mythology-inspired lands to hostile alien worlds await you and your friends. Filled with wonder and plunder, challenges and adversaries, your task is to restore these beautiful worlds to their former glory! GATHER RESOURCES! The worlds are filled with rich minerals ready to be harvested by your trusty tools, and mythical artifacts of untapped power guarded by powerful foes. Use more than 70 different gatherable resources to recreate lands long lost to a mysterious threat. RISE UP TO THE CHALLENGE! The universe won’t be restored that easily, and each challenge requires the proper tools for the job. Equipped with your trusty pickaxe, sharp sword, and sturdy axe, you’ll be thrown against 150+ different adversaries including mythical creatures, alien horrors, and even demigods! UPGRADE YOUR GEAR! With each planet comes new challenges and because of that, you have to stay prepared by upgrading to the newest and freshest tools, which will always keep you one step ahead of your opponents! Improve your weapon, tools, and armor up to 30+ levels! Just Enjoy The Adventure. Get entranced by the game’s cozy atmosphere, enjoy the relaxing soundtrack, and fall in love with the simplistic yet charismatic visuals. After all, it’s all about the journey and the friends we make along the way!",
