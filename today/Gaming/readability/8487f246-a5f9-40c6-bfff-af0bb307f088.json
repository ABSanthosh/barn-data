  "text": "You may need to empty the piggy bank to get Nvidia's next graphics card.The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 is looming on the horizon, but while we don't have official word on next-generation graphics cards, rumors are swirling about specs and pricing. Take this with a grain of salt, but right now the Nvidia RTX 5090 is rumored to cost between $1,999 and $2,499, according to popular leaker Moore's Law is Dead. The video also suggests the RTX 5080 may cost as much as $1,499. Compared to the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080, which cost $1,599 and $1,199 at launch, respectively, this would be a massive price jump if these leaks are true. For the RTX 5090 at least, this potentially high pricing could be due to inflated specs. The RTX 5090 is rumored to be a 600W part with 21,760 CUDA cores with 32GB of GDDR7 memory on a 512-bit bus, according to hardware leaker kopite7kimi on Twitter. If accurate, the RTX 5090 would be the first GPU to hit the market with GDDR7 memory, which would be much faster than the GDDR6X memory found on the RTX 4090. We still don't know when Nvidia is going to grace us with the RTX 5090's presence, but it's increasingly likely that Nvidia's next graphics cards will be launching early next year. After all, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is hosting the CES 2024 keynote, giving Team Green ample opportunity to announce a new generation of gaming graphics cards – a first for CES.I've reached out to Nvidia for comment, and I'll update this story if and when I hear back. Could the RTX 5090 really cost $2499?Nvidia's top GPUs have been getting more expensive with each generation, so it wouldn't be a huge surprise if the RTX 5090 costs more than the RTX 4090. However, if the top-end of the leaked price range is accurate, it would mean nearly a $1,000 jump in price for the next-generation enthusiast graphics card. Assuming the rumors are accurate, that price will get you both more and faster memory than what's on the RTX 4090, which would be a massive boost to performance. Plus, the RTX 5090 would also feature all the architectural improvements made to Blackwell when it launched for data centers earlier this year. There's more of a problem when it comes to lower-end graphics cards, however. That Moore's Law is Dead video suggested an internal briefing from Nvidia – from an anonymous source – claimed the RTX 5070 would be competitive with the RTX 4070 Ti. Right now the leaked pricing suggests the RTX 5070 may launch for $699 with 12GB of VRAM. That's $100 more expensive than the RTX 4070 Super, which also comes with 12GB of VRAM. Keep in mind if Nvidia really is saving the RTX 5090 for CES, rather than the fall release it usually does, these leaks are very much subject to change. CES 2024 is still three months away, and a lot can change, especially when it comes to pricing. Jackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.
