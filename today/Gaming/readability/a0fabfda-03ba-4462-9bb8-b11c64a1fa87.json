Amazon is offering the 65\" LG Evo C4 4K OLED Smart TV for only $1496.99 after a $1200 price drop. Because it's a 2024 model, the LG C4 hasn't seen many big price drops this year. This is the best deal we've seen that's not YMMV and is readily accessible to most people. This is an outstanding TV that has won top spots in several of our buying guides, including best 4K TV, best TV for gaming, and best TV for the PlayStation 5. It's a great match for the new PlayStation 5 Pro that's currently up for preorder.Update: The 2023 65\" LG Evo C3 4K OLED smart TV is now also on sale for $1296.99. The $200 cost savings is probably worth it for most people because both the C3 and C4 TVs use the same OLED panel.65\" LG Evo C4 4K OLED Smart TV: The Best PS5 TV65\" LG Evo C4 4K OLED Smart TVThe C4 is the current generation 2024 model among LG's highly vaunted C-series OLED TV lineup. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. The C4 uses LG's Evo panel, which offers higher brightness levels than traditional OLED TVs. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV excels at displaying 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. Compared to other OLED TVs, LG has the most generations of updates and improvements.The C4 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has four HDMI 2.1 ports all capable of up to 144Hz refresh rate at 4K resolution. That's great news for PS5 (and now PS5 Pro), Xbox Series X, and PC gamers, since several games can be played at frame rates of 120fps and beyond. The C4 also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) including NVIDIA G-SYNC and auto low latency mode (ALLM). When connected to a PC, it supports chroma 4:4:4 for better text legibility.A particularly nice feature that isn't advertised often is the surprisingly light weight of the C4. The 65\" TV weighs in at only 36.6 pounds without the stand. That's because the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that's lighter than the plastics most TVs use. It might not matter much in the long term, but this is a welcome advantage when you are first setting up your TV, especially if you plan on wall mounting.65\" LG Evo C3 4K OLED Smart TV: Older Model, Just As Good65\" LG Evo C3 4K OLED Smart TVThe C3 is the 2023 predecessor the the C4. Because the C3 and C4 use the same OLED panel, picture quality is nearly identical with very minor improvements to the C4 thanks to a newer processor. Other upgrades of the C4 over the C3 include an updated WebOS smart interface, support for DTS audio, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate. For most people, these updates aren't worth the $200 cost savings by going with the C3.Should You Buy Now or Wait for Black Friday?Although this is an extremely good discount for one of our favorite gaming TVs, you may be wondering if you should wait until Black Friday to make a purchase. Black Friday 2024 will definitely have more options available, however we doubt that this particular model will drop in price further. If it does, it certainly won't be by too much. Whatever you decide, this discount makes this easily one of the best TV deals right now.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
