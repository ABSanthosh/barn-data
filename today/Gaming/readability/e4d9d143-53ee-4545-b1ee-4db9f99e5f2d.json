  "description": "Are you ready to solve Eight Realms in Eight Months in Blue Prince? You're going to stumble upon this puzzle a few hours into your playthrough. However, you won't have all the information to make heads or tails of what you actually need to do. Thankfully, our guide here has all the details. Just watch out because we're going to include a few spoilers as well.How to solve Eight Realms in Eight Months in Blue Prince - Room 46 Map Puzzle guideEight Realms in Eight Months is quite a doozy of a puzzle. It involves doing the following:Revisit Room 46 after clearing the campaign once. Look behind the chair on the desk to see a map with pins. This is the Eight Realms in Eight Months Puzzle. It's a map with several continents and regions, and there are eight pins that you can place.Some partial clues can be found in other parts of the estate: The History of Orindia and Realm \u0026 Rune - These books can be purchased via the Bookstore, and you can request them in the Library.Classroom - Upon drafting a Classroom, you should check the test papers that students submitted. Likewise, if you can draft the Schoolhouse as an outer room, you can place up to eight Classrooms in the manor. The higher class \"grades\" have maps of the world.The most important hints, however, come from the Sanctum Keys that you've collected. These lead you to doorways in the Underground, where you have to solve the Sigil Puzzles.Each room with a Sigil Puzzle has a postcard from Herbert Sinclair detailing his trip. His letters addressed to you denote the correct order of the pins on the map board in Room 46.Note: Our guide looks into the clues first in case you want to solve the puzzle on your own. Or, you can skip straight ahead to the end to learn about the solution. Eight Realms in Eight Months clues: The History of Orindia and Realm \u0026 RuneBefore we provide the solution to the Blue Prince Eight Realms in Eight Months Puzzle, let's check out some clues from a couple of books:The History of Orindia book has a page that shows the eastern hemisphere of the map--i.e. Fenn Aries, Eraja, and Arch Aries. You can see this in the image above. The symbols on the landmasses correspond to some of the core symbols from the Sanctum Sigil Puzzles.Realm \u0026 Rune, which is primarily used for the Sanctum Sigil Puzzles, also has a page showing the core symbols of each nation. Another page even details terrains and transportation modes. Eight Realms in Eight Months clues: Classroom tests and mapsAs mentioned earlier, you can select the Schoolhouse if it appears as an outer room. This lets you draft up to eight additional classrooms inside the mansion.Some of the lesson plans and maps tell you about the history of the land. This includes the different continents and regions on the world map. The test papers, meanwhile, show flags with the correct colors--i.e. these are the flags of the nations from the books. Eight Realms in Eight Months clues: The Postcards from the Sanctum Sigil PuzzleNow, assuming you've solved all the Sanctum Sigil Puzzles, then you've likely seen the following:An illustration of a locale, be it a village, a mountain, a beach, etc.Herbert's letter to Simon talking about his travels.Flags and insignias with different colors.The idea is to arrange Herbert's letters in a chronological order. Imagine that he's sharing news about his journey. If so, which location did he come from? Which location did he travel to next? Which continent did he go to afterward? All of these appear as contextual clues in the letters. Eight Realms in Eight Months: Herbert's Travels Around the WorldOkay, we promise this is the last section about clues for the Blue Prince Eight Realms in Eight Months Puzzle. This is basically how Herbert's trip went:First location: Fenn Aries (chip symbol) - The first letter from the first Sigil Puzzle (from the left) tells you of how he started his journey. See how it matches the map from the History of Orindia.Second location: Eraja (hourglass symbol) - Herbert mentioned going south, so look at the Orindia map to see which region is south of Fenn Aries.Third location: Arch Aries (mountain symbol) - There are a couple of clues here: Herbert said that he misses the old days when railway tracks extended north.He wanted to trek along the northern coast.Fourth location: Mora Jai (cap symbol) - Herbert arrived on the main island after a sea voyage.Fifith location: Verra (jigsaw symbol) - Herbert mentioned that the weather in Verra is more severe compared to Mora Jai--i.e. he's been to Mora Jai already.Sixth location: Corarica (heart symbol) - It seems that frigid weather in Corarica is a welcome relief compared to Verra.Seventh location: Nuance (diamond symbol) - Herbert says that the views are as stirring as the ones in Corarica and Mora Jai, which he previously visited. He also says that he looks to the east and sees red flags.Eighth location: Fenn Aries (pentagon symbol) - He mentions that this is his last postcard. Moreover, the Sigil Puzzle painting has the nation's red flags. Eight Realms in Eight Months solutionThe image above shows you how to solve the Eight Realms in Eight Months Puzzle. You just need to place the pins on the correct regions/landmasses:Pin #1: Fenn Aries - The middle of the large landmasses at the right-hand side of the map.Pin #2: Eraja - South of #1 (Fenn Aries).Pin #3: Arch Aries - North of #1 (Fenn Aries).Pin #4: Mora Jai - The large northern island across the ocean from #3 (Arch Aries).Pin #5: Verra - The medium-sized circular island in the middle of the map.Pin #6: Corarica - The massive landmass at the left side of the map.Pin #7: Nuance - The Scotland-esque landmass to the left of #1 and #2.Pin #8: Fenn Aries - Herbert was already home when he penned his last letter. It means you should place the pin on the location of #1 as well.That's it! You've solved the Eight Realms in Eight Months Puzzle in Blue Prince. A small compartment will open, revealing a couple of letters. These aren't just for background lore or fluff. They're actually related to other puzzles and discoveries, too.A surreal adventure filled with wonders and mysteries await you in Blue Prince.
