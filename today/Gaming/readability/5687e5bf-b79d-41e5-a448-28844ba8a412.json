  "text": "[Ed. note: This post contains spoilers for the end of Squid Game season 2.]Squid Game season 2 went out with a bang and a whimper. Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) has effectively lost his attempt at gaining control of the game, and the aggressive cut on the ending leaves a lot to be desired. (For me; no shade, I just desire to see more, and soon preferably.)Luckily, Squid Game season 3 is already on its way — and with a release date coming mid-2025. With this being the final season (more on that below), it’s shaping up to be a cutthroat final run of episodes. Particularly with the fates of Gi-hun’s fellow players still a bit unknown; some were killed in the rebellion, but others… well, that’s all to say they might not be much better off. Which is again to note: I would like to see it! Here’s everything we know about the new season of the hit show.Is there going to be a Squid Game season 3?Yes! In a July letter announcing the release date for season 2, showrunner Hwang Dong-hyuk announced that Squid Game had been picked up for a third and final season already.When will Squid Game season 3 come out?The wait for season 3 will be much shorter than it was for season 2: At the end of January, Netflix announced that the release date would be on June 27, 2025.What will season 3 of Squid Game be about?Well, it’s certainly going to have to pick up the pieces: Gi-hun tried to lead a rebellion and take down the games from the inside. That went poorly, to put it mildly. It cost his most enthusiastic allies their lives, including his best friend Jung-bae (Lee Seo-hwan). There’s still a large contingent of players hiding out in the barracks, and who even knows what kinds of games they’re going to get put through after this. Plus, the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) has decidedly switched back into his main persona, deserting his role as Player 001 to stand imposingly over a weeping Gi-hun.Per Netflix’s announcement, season 3 of Squid Game will start with those in the games — on both sides of the divide — possibly moments after we left off:Picking up where the second season left off, Season 3 explores the choices Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) will make amidst overwhelming despair. As the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) plots his next move, the surviving players find their decisions leading to increasingly dire consequences with each round of the deadly games.Even with that, there’s plenty to still figure out, like: What happens to the games now? How much of this did the Front Man anticipate? Where do the other players, each desperate for their own rescue (financial or otherwise), land in all this? Will the rich people who run the games be upset? What does Gi-hun do now?Judging from the first look photos released by Netflix, we’ll at least be getting something more in the actual games; the Front Man appears to be seated amid the room with the rich observers, as seen below. It’s possible the surviving players are left to simply continue the game (maybe without the option to vote their way out of it). As for what that means for Gi-hun — well, as the plot synopsis says: probably “overwhelming despair.” Still, I wouldn’t count that guy out just yet.Will Squid Game season 3 be the last season?It will be the final season of the show. Considering Squid Game was originally meant to just be a single season, that’s pretty good! Especially since Hwang feels the finale — whatever it may be — flowed organically from the writing. “When I was thinking about the idea for the ending of season three, I think it sort of naturally came to me that this was the finale,” Hwang said. “I believed that with that story, I was able to tell everything that I wanted to tell through the story of Squid Game and also in the perspective of Gi-hun as a character, and I thought that we don’t need any further stories from here.”What games will be in Squid Game season 3?Squid Game season 2 threw a bit of a wrench into Gi-hun’s plans: Although he briefly thought he could simply save everyone by helping them get through the games together with his inside knowledge, it turned out that after Red Light, Green Light there was a whole new batch of games awaiting him.So, assuming the games move forward (even just for a single level — which, given the number of people left, seems like the exact sort of cruel thing the game makers would do), what childhood game will they subject people to? The stakes have never seemed bloodier or less hopeful, so it seems like the game makers might trot out something truly sick, like Double Dutch.",

What does Gi-hun do now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJudging from the first look photos released by Netflix, we’ll at least be getting \u003cem\u003esomething\u003c/em\u003e more in the actual games; the Front Man appears to be seated amid the room with the rich observers, as seen below. It’s possible the surviving players are left to simply continue the game (maybe without the option to vote their way out of it). As for what that means for Gi-hun — well, as the plot synopsis says: probably “overwhelming despair.” Still, I wouldn’t count that guy out just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Squidgame_Unit_311_N026801.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0,0,100,100\" data-pswp-height=\"2000\" data-pswp-width=\"3000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"The Front Man sitting in a chair in the observation room in a still from Squid Game season 3\" data-chromatic=\"ignore\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" sizes=\"(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px\" srcset=\"https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Squidgame_Unit_311_N026801.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Squidgame_Unit_311_N026801.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Squidgame_Unit_311_N026801.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Squidgame_Unit_311_N026801.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Squidgame_Unit_311_N026801.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Squidgame_Unit_311_N026801.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Squidgame_Unit_311_N026801.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Squidgame_Unit_311_N026801.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Squidgame_Unit_311_N026801.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Squidgame_Unit_311_N026801.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Squidgame_Unit_311_N026801.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Squidgame_Unit_311_N026801.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Squidgame_Unit_311_N026801.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Squidgame_Unit_311_N026801.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Squidgame_Unit_311_N026801.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=2400 2400w\" src=\"https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Squidgame_Unit_311_N026801.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=2400\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp id=\"will-squid-game-season-3-be-the-last-season\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWill Squid Game season 3 be the last season?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt will be the final season of the show.
