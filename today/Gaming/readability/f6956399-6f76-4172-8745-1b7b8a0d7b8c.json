Scars of Destruction As I noted about a month back, it is the season for the three key fantasy MMORPGs in the Daybreak stable to release their annual expansions.  LOTRO released the Legacy of Morgoth about two weeks back.  Now it is the turn of EverQuest II with the Scars of Destruction expansion. The updated pitch for this expansion: Long ago, under the threat of the prophesied Age’s End, fate thrust us upon the frozen shores of Velious, the treacherous lands of dragon, dwarf, and giant. Much had changed over the last 500 years, because of time and turmoil, both natural and celestial. The worst of which targeted the continent’s Western Wastes, a place revered by dragons and their kin due to the scars left upon its landscape by the dragon goddess, Veeshan. Here she had left her mark, and here her children lived and died since the Age of Scale. It had been destroyed and sealed off in a desperate attempt to stop The Awakened from claiming the unhatched and the power of the land for himself. It was a costly maneuver. Too many dragons, dragonkin, and egg met their brutal end. Now, word reaches us that something survived, and that the lands have been reforming, beyond the impassable draconic defenses! Lucan D’Lere, The Overlord of Freeport, is determined to raid the lost Dragon Necropolis, within the shattered remains of Velious’ Western Wastes! Together with the help from Osh, Lodizal, and other heroes along the way, you might be able to stop Lucan’s evil plan and save Norrath once again! At least we have nailed down the approximate location of the expansion, which brings the following updates: Store your Petamorph wands in the new Petamorph Key Ring! Make your weapons sparkle with new Weapon Auras! New signature adventure quests New signature tradeskill quests New adventure quests New achievements New collections New Heroic Zones New Raids Zones New zones Western Wastes Sodden Archipelago Blackhook Spiral Dragon Necropolis I mean, I am sure it is all the usual stuff, new zones, new dungeons, and all that… but what else are you going to ask for 20 years into the game?  All of this is wrapped up into a launch trailer as well. Anyway, this 21st expansion for the game has gone live and is available at the previously discussed price points: Standard Edition – $35 Collector’s Edition – $70 Premium Edition – $140 Family and Friends – $250 Once again, that $250 buys you in game versions to give, trade, or sell.  Also, every price level gets you a level 130 boost for your adventure level… but if you want a trade skill boost, you will need to opt for the big package… or buy it in the cash shop. And, of course, for those who are all access subscribers there is a 10% discount on your purchase.  So post-shattering Norrath expands once more.
