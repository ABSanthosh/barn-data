  "text": "\"Rest well Mark and thank you.\"Celebrated TV series composer Mark Snow has died aged 78.Snow, who grew up in Brooklyn, New York, is best-known for composing the iconic The X-Files theme tune, which became the soundtrack to the conspiracy theory-obsessed Nineties. With its spooky whistle that played alongside a title sequence that contained a number of creepy images, such as a stretchy face series creator Chris Carter specifically requested, Snow‚Äôs The X-Files is among the most recognisable in TV theme history.But Snow also composed the entire series‚Äô initial nine-season run from 1993 to 2001, returning for the revival in 2015. Six of Snow's 15 Emmy nominations were for the The X-Files episodes he scored.Away from The X-Files, Snow composed for the likes of Smallville, Blue Bloods, The Twilight Zone, and Carter‚Äôs The X-Files follow-up Millennium. Snow returned to The X-Files for the revival in 2015. He passed away on Friday, July 4, at his home in Connecticut, according to The Hollywood Reporter.Snow also worked on a number of video games, including 1998‚Äôs Urban Assault and The X-Files Game, and Sony Bend‚Äôs 2004 PlayStation 2 exclusive Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain. His final project was the 2020 X-Men film The New Mutants.The instrumental The X Files was a hit single in the United Kingdom and peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart in 1996. According to Variety, this amused Snow, who said: \"Nothing really big happens in the song. It stays in A-minor, there‚Äôs no singing, drums or guitars, and it was a smash hit. That‚Äôs pretty wild.\"Composer Mark Snow, creator Chris Carter, and writer/producer Frank Spotnitz at the premiere of X-Files: I Want to Believe in 2008.

He was always charming and friendly.‚ÄùMark Snow didn‚Äôt just score this scene‚Äîhe scored the soul of The X-Files. Without his music, there‚Äôs no tension, no atmosphere, no catharsis.
