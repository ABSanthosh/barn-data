Two big hits from the Lies of P series are on deep discount over at Fanatical, and there’s a shiny preorder deal for Borderlands 4 with multiple editions up for grabs. If you’re itching for fresh horror-laced action or chaotic looter-shooting, you’re in luck. Use the FANATICAL15 code and you can scoop both Lies titles for under $26 each, which is downright criminal given how much content they pack in. Just under the games, you’ll find a batch of budget-friendly gaming monitors that punch way above their price tags. Scroll a bit further and the premium screens take over—with everything from QD-OLED giants to curved 240Hz beasts ready to level up your setup. Let's get straight into today's deals: This one’s a no-brainer for Soulslike fans. Lies of P is creepy, tough, and packed with story. With that FANATICAL15 code, it drops under $26. Pretty wild considering how polished and content-rich it is. The Overture prequel dives deeper into the twisted lore of Krat. Anyone hooked on the main game will want to see what came before. It’s the same great discount too, which definitely helps. If you're just in it for the chaos and co-op mayhem, the Standard Edition does the trick. Sure, it's full price, but with all the Borderlands polish and that pre-order pack thrown in, it holds up. This version adds a nice touch of extra loot and cosmetics from the start. For players who want to feel slightly ahead of the pack, it’s a solid midpoint that doesn’t feel bloated. Going all in with the Super Deluxe means grabbing everything in one go. Future DLC, bonus hunters, extra content. It’s the Borderlands experience in its biggest, loudest form. ` Big 4K display, high refresh rate, curved for immersion. This MSI checks all the boxes. At under $380, it’s surprisingly well equipped and handles both PC and console play smoothly. With its wide QHD curve and fast refresh, this LG UltraGear wraps you into every game. It’s great for immersive solo play and wide enough to split screen when needed. That 1000R curve is no gimmick. It really does pull you in. This monitor nails that ultra-wide, ultra-immersive vibe without breaking the bank. Clean visuals, fast action, and solid color accuracy from a fast IPS panel. It’s easy to use all day, whether gaming or multitasking with a bunch of open windows. 280Hz on a 1440p panel at this price is rare. It’s ideal for competitive players who want high refresh and smooth motion without compromising on sharp visuals. The Ark is wild. It’s basically a wraparound gaming theater with a screen that rotates and multitasks like a champ. The size alone makes every game feel massive. It’s pricey, but the discount definitely takes the sting out. This is one of those monitors that feels future proof. Stunning OLED quality, sleek design, and the $300 gift card makes the price way easier to justify. You’re getting both serious performance and a bonus for other gear. Dual QHD OLED and 240Hz? That combo is a dream for multitaskers and competitive players. It’s super wide and incredibly sharp. For this kind of display, the current price is hard to beat. OLED clarity on a 49 inch curved panel makes this a beast of a screen. Whether it's deep shadows or fast action, everything just looks better. It’s a big discount on a serious piece of gear. This one’s a solid pick if you want premium visuals without hitting the $1,000 mark. Still OLED, still ultra wide, and still packed with features that deliver on every front. MSI’s take on the QD-OLED format really stands out. The picture is punchy, the curve is just right, and it doesn’t scream flashy even though it performs like a top-tier panel. Great option for high-end gaming setups. The 1000R curve pulls you right into the action and the DQHD resolution makes sure everything stays sharp across the entire span. It's built for immersion, no extra gimmicks needed. This LG OLED packs insane color, speed, and a clean white aesthetic that makes it feel high end right out of the box. Streaming built-in and cloud gaming support is just a slick bonus on top of the core performance. Dual mode 4K at 240Hz or FHD at 480Hz is just absurdly fast. Perfect for someone chasing peak performance in shooters or esports. It’s not cheap, but it’s built for serious players who want the best.",
