[Also, classic TAGN headline gaffe, now fixed.  You can see in the URL that I copied last year’s headline as a placeholder then forgot to update it!] A look at 2024 With another year of data collected it is time to answer the musical questions, what did I play in 2024, thanks to ManicTime, which tracks usage on my PC. Here are the top ten games I played in 2024, based on time spent playing, and when during 2024 I played them. The 2024 Top Ten Break Down I appreciate people like Belghast who go all in on the chart and list every title they played… but I never click on those charts to look at the details.  Sorry.  And the stats here indicate that almost nobody ever clicks on images to view them in detail here, so I try to make my charts visible with the 650 pixel width that is the current max image size set for the site. (In fact, the most common images people click on are things like the Stars Reach splash screen I put at the top of posts about specific games, no doubt thinking that clicking there will take them to the game’s page.  I don’t know.  The only exception seems to be maps, the top one being that Sunken Temple annotated map I have in an old post, which was the most clicked-on image for the site in 2024.  Maps include game roadmaps.  People will click on those.) As one might expect, I played EVE Online throughout the year.  Sometimes I played more, sometimes I played less, but I got my fleet participation credit and on a kill mail with my main character every single month.  New Eden is an ongoing space opera, and I stay tuned in waiting for the next twist. WoW Classic, which wrapped up Wrath of the Lich King then launched into Cataclysm is next on the list.  That kind of faded as Cata got long in the tooth pretty quickly. The year kicked off with a search for something like Valheim… which led us to play Valheim again, kicking off our third run at the game as a group.  We came up short as a group at the Mistlands, which were, frankly speaking, a pain in the ass, though I pressed on with mods and such to at least get into the Ashlands before calling it.  Iron Gate wants a game that plays more hardcore than I care for now. But, on finishing that, we split off and did some time with Conan Exiles, which was good, and then Potshot and I experimented with No Man’s Sky to see how multiplayer it had become.  It is kind of odd in that regard. Then the year finished off with our Valheim-like quest landing on Enshrouded which, in just two months of play landed in my fourth slot overall. Below No Man’s Sky we get into some side titles.  I logged into EverQuest a lot, but not to play really.  It was just a time to go back and look at the sights in the world 25 years after launch.  I also played the Overseer mini-game until that wore out, but I doubt anyone would say that I “played” EQ in 2024.  I just kind of hung around, so I made the coloring a partial fill for that time because 11 months is a long stretch for the amount of time clocked. Stars Reach is also a bit dubious on the “play” front, as it is in pre-alpha testing, so I did some play tests for a stretch.  This is also partial color fill due to the overall time spent being probably much less than it would have been had the game been up to play full time. Then Balatro was my solitaire fixation for a bit, reviving itself later on the iPad.  I colored in December to cover the iPad transition, though the time counted is only for PC.  I wonder if the “revised yet again for iOS 18 Game Center” gives me any data I could use.  Do I really want to log my Pokemon Go time?  Yes I do! And, finally, rounding out the top ten is Combat Mission: Barbarossa to Berlin, a 2001 title that has been kept alive over at GoG.com.  It also got a partial fill in its bar because I play it pretty sporadically, a game or two a month, but haven’t gone all Civilization “one more turn” with it or anything. Beyond the top ten, my overall games played as tracked by ManicTime were: EVE Online – 30.63% WoW Classic – 23.29% Valheim – 17.27% Enshrouded – 7.48% Conan Exiles – 5.31% No Man’s Sky – 4.31% EverQuest – 3.42% Stars Reach – 1.97% Balatro – 1.95% CM:BB – 1.11% ESO – 0.58% Tarisland – 0.34% Guild Wars 2 – 0.34% World of Warcraft – 0.33% CM:RT – 0.30% Wreckfest – 0.18% Lethal Company – 0.13% The Front – 0.13% Space Engineers – 0.12% Pantheon – 0.12% Palia – 0.11% Once Human – 0.10% Forza Horizon 4 – 0.09% Glaxicus – 0.09% EverQuest II – 0.08% Astro Colony – 0.06% Starstruck Vagabond – 0.05% Rust – 0.05% Sons of the Forest – 0.04% Hearthstone – 0.02% ManicTime tracked a bit over one thousand hours of play, so you can do the quick math in your head to see how much actual time I spent with each.  ManicTime also disagrees with my Steam play time for a number of titles because it tracks only the time a specific executable has focus and is active on your screen while Steam just cares about how long the executable was running, in focus or not.  Still, it lines up pretty well.  I spent a half an hour on Starstruck Vagabond and the same trying to get Rust to even run, so about right. Thirty titles is kind of a lot for me in one year, though much of that was the search for a Valheim-like title in the new year, which saw me trying out titles like Astro Colony, Rust, Sons of the Forest, The Front, Lethal Company, and Space Engineers to see what might fit. There were also a couple of other MMOs on the list, Elder Scrolls Online, Guild Wars 2, Tarisland, and retail WoW were all things I took a shot at playing, even if online for a little bit.  Of the titles I guessed at the start of the year that I might play, the following came to pass: WoW Classic – Season of Discovery Cataclysm Classic EVE Online Valheim, or something like Valheim Tarisland EverQuest (For specific definitions of “play”) Forza Horizon 4/5 The one title from the possibilities that did not make the cut was: Baldur’s Gate 3 Potshot and I never quite got back to that.  It is a title that we wanted to play co-op, but it does require some effort and time to keep up and one person holds the save and the rest of the group wasn’t there for it so… no more. So that is the story of my game play in 2024. Now to look forward into 2025 and take a stab at what I might play, broken down into the usual categories I have adopted for such posts. Likely Candidates: Mists of Pandaria Classic EVE Online Enshrouded Balatro Why should 2025 be any different that 2024?  EVE Online is a lock for sure, and it seems likely that the group will carry on into Pandaria even if Cataclysm feels about done for us.  Meanwhile, we’re currently playing Enshrouded, so there you go. Balatro probably won’t rack up any hours on my PC, but it will be there on my iPad for sure. Strong Possibilities: Path of Exile 2 Civilization VII Whatever replaces Enshrouded in the Valheim niche If PoE2 leaves early access and goes free to play, it is pretty much a lock.  We’ll see if that happens.  I might even go there if they just decide it has a $30 box price, but only once it settles down and removes the early access flag. Another Civ title seems a likely venture as well… though unless it is really solid on day one I will probably wait for a few months to let it settle into a stable state. Finally, I am not saying we’re done with Enshrouded, but there are other options coming up this year like Dune: Awakening. Seems possible: No Man’s Sky Palia Combat Mission: Barbarossa to Berlin Guild Wars 2 Stars Reach Some other old title A piece of me wants to get in and finish a game of No Man’s Sky.  I also want to go back and explore Palia and maybe find the right hook to keep me engaged with Guild Wars 2… the latter mostly because I’d like to try out their housing, but need to get to level cap to make that worthwhile. I will also probably continue to help play test Stars Reach, though that will be more likely when they get into some space faring experiences. Things I will want to play, but probably won’t: World of Warcraft (retail) Forza Horizon 4/5 World of Tanks / War Thunder Project: Gorgon Most of my Steam library It just seems to work out that way.  I have a limited amount of time and a hierarchy or titles I am in the mood to play. I will say that WoW retail has worked its way up from the “negative interest” category of last year to me having some desire to play.  This is largely based on the whole housing thing and WoW Classic getting into less interesting territory and the fact that there is always some desire to go back.  That said, it doesn’t seem likely until maybe late in the year. Negative Interest: EverQuest II EverQuest Minecraft LOTRO Valheim Not bad games… in fact, very good games… so good I have spent a lot of time with all of them.  But that is also the list of titles I have worn out or have grown so far from that a return… a real return… feels unlikely.  It could happen, but I am really not feeling it right now in the new year. So that is my forecast for the year, such that it is.  I don’t even pretend to know what I’ll be playing in six months.  We’re four days in and I have already played something not explicitly on the list.  Nearly two decades of blogging has taught me that apparently EVE Online is the only constant in my gaming universe. Past entries in the series: 2023 – Combined summary and predictions into one post 2022 – Combined summary and predictions into one post 2021 – Combined summary and predictions into one post 2020 – Combined summary and predictions into one post 2019 – I played some things that I predicted I would, but not many 2018 – Technically, mission accomplished; reality, not so much. 2017 – I played nothing from the list, though arguably only two were playable 2016 – I played none from the list, but most didn’t ship 2015 – literally nothing I listed went live 2014 – I played Warlords of Draenor, which was a gimme really 2012 – Actually tried most of the items on the list 2011 – Tried 3 out of 5 eventually, but then The Agency was on the list 2007 LOTRO (shipped!) 2007 Gods \u0026 Heroes: Rome Rising (Didn’t ship)",

your head to see how much actual time I spent with each.  ManicTime also disagrees with my Steam play time for a number of titles because it tracks only the time a specific executable has focus and is active on your screen while Steam just cares about how long the executable was running, in focus or not.  Still, it lines up pretty well.  I spent a half an hour on \u003cem\u003eStarstruck Vagabond\u003c/em\u003e and the same trying to get \u003cem\u003eRust\u003c/em\u003e to even run, so about right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty titles is kind of a lot for me in one year, though much of that was the search for a \u003cem\u003eValheim\u003c/em\u003e-like title in the new year, which saw me trying out titles like \u003cem\u003eAstro Colony, Rust, Sons of the Forest, The Front, Lethal Company\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eSpace Engineers\u003c/em\u003e to see what might fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were also a couple of other MMOs on the list, \u003cem\u003eElder Scrolls Online, Guild Wars 2, Tarisland\u003c/em\u003e, and retail \u003cem\u003eWoW\u003c/em\u003e were all things I took a shot at playing, even if online for a little bit.  Of
