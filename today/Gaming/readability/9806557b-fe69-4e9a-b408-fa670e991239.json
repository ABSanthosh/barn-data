  "text": "Quest first, PCVR/PSVR2 to follow. Image credit: Fireproof Games Fireproof Games - the studio behind eerie puzzle box adventure The Room and its equally stellar sequels - has announced a launch date for its paranormal VR mystery Ghost Town. It's coming to Meta Quest on 24th April, with a PCVR/PSVR2 release due later this year. Ghost Town, if you're unfamiliar, whisks players back to 1983, where they'll take on the role of ghost hunter Edith Penrose. Edith runs a successful paranormal detective agency in London with her flatmate and, as Fireproof puts it, \"she's almost up-to-date with her rent and the ghosts in her bathroom mirror have been less demanding than usual.\" Unfortunately, Edith's world is turned upside down when her brother goes missing - and so begins a quest to locate his whereabouts, first taking her to a remote Scottish island in search of a gifted clairvoyant, and later through the supernatural underbelly of London. GHOST TOWN comes to Meta Quest April 24th Ghost Town - Meta Quest release date trailer.Watch on YouTube All this unfolds across \"large navigable environments\" where players will interact with fully motion-captured characters, both alive and dead. \"Explore a variety of atmospheric locations with a controller in each hand and a torch to light your way,\" Fireproof explains. \"Use the dexterity of your hands to overcome tactile puzzles, cast spells and even summon troubled spirits to move them on to the next world.\" Fireproof's The Room series was an absolute pleasure, blending cleverly tactile head scratchers with some deliciously sinister atmospherics - and the studio's most recent game, 2020's The Room VR: A Dark Matter, was a particular highlight. So I'm genuinely excited to see how Ghost Town plays out. And with a 24th April release on Meta Quest now confirmed (and PSVR2/PCVR to follow), there isn't much longer to wait. Oh, and if you're looking for more goggle-based entertainment, here's everything announced in this week's VR Games Showcase.",
