  "text": "Dating Killmulator explores a more lighthearted side to homicide as you find yourself falling for a potential killer. There are dating simulators out there for basically everything. You can find games allowing you to date monsters, weapons, household objects, and with Dating Killmulator, you can actually date a serial killer. Whether you approve of your partner’s hobbies or feel that maybe they might be sort of wrong, you will be dating them, so need to think carefully about what you say! I got the chance to play a small demo of Dating Killmulator at Indie Dev Day where I played the UK Humor version. This narrative-driven game has a bunch of different languages that are sort of localized to be full of funny moments within the story itself. In this game, you play as a student looking to go to college when something strange happens outside the bus station. Suddenly, there is a dead body and a hero that you have fallen for. After this point, Dating Killmulator has a lot of relatable moments where you will be gossiping with your friends and getting ready for the day. Your dad is embarrassing and your friend is obsessed with a guy who sucks. Normal student life. It almost feels like the fact that you are dating a serial killer is just a normal part of life. With True Crime being such a popular subject, I really do understand how a game like Dating Killmulator would come about. Surely some of these killers have partners, but it’s really interesting being put into such a non-serious feeling game around the subject. I feel that the lighthearted nature of the demo that I played fits perfectly in the world around it – this isn’t a scary or horror-like game and instead is your average dating simulator with an entirely new twist added to it. Dating Killmulator is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can grab a demo from the developer’s site.
