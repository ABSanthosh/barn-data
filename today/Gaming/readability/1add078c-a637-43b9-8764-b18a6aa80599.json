  "text": "Techland's original zombie parkour game refuses to die.Techland is taking players back to Harran after 10 years with a surprise free content release for the original Dying Light that it’s calling the Retouched update.Come June 26, 2025, the thousands of players who haven’t been able to let go of the 2015 zombie parkour hit will be treated to improvements that should improve the experience across the board. The Dying Light: Retouched update includes visual enhancements, a remastered soundtrack, and more for players across PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S. IGN has asked Techland about a potential Nintendo Switch version of the Retouched update.So, let's set the record straight: the Retouched Update is about squeezing out even more from the Dying Light you already love.It’s an exciting time to be a fan of the original Dying Light, but Techland wants to make one thing clear: Retouched is not a remaster. Franchise director Tymon Smektała said this update is more about improving the original experience without altering its system requirements.“When I looked online the day after [the update was announced], my heart skipped a beat. Quite a few of you were expecting a full remaster of some sort,” Smektała explained in a new blog post. “So, let's set the record straight: the Retouched Update is about squeezing out even more from the Dying Light you already love. It’s not a complete overhaul or remaster.”Some of the visual enhancements players can expect include improved textures, lighting, and shadows. You might notice a wooden fence has a bit more detail or that certain metal surfaces will reflect light more realistically, for example. Techland is especially proud of how some floors and cement walls look in Dying Light: Retouched, sharing images of stone paths that feature more depth than before.Dying Light: Retouched - ScreenshotsIn the audio department, original Dying Light composer Paweł Blaszczak returned to remaster the soundtrack. The entire soundtrack has been re-recorded on tape for Retouched, with new tracks, ambient sounds, and even hit reaction audio also remastered for this week’s update.“A lot of you have been asking in the last few months about the Retouched Update — where it was, why it was taking so long,” the post continued. “The honest answer is this: we were working with 10+ year old technology. Even with all the new experience we've gained over the years, figuring out how to apply those learnings to the original Dying Light engine while keeping everything stable was a challenge.”The Dying Light: Retouched update is less Techland reanimating a long-forgotten corpse and more of an example of that team delivering a surprise for a game that has somehow managed to stand the test of time. Despite SteamDB listing a player peak of only 45,876, the original Dying Light has hovered around the 12,000-player mark for the last year. Those are impressive numbers for a zombie game that mostly leans on its single-player offerings, and it’s even more impressive considering Dying Light 2: Stay Human, which launched just three years ago, usually struggles to break 10,000 players.The original Dying Light story will continue with the launch of Dying Light: The Beast, which recently pinned down a release date of August 22, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. It follows original protagonist Kyle Crane in a new story, and you check out our preview of how it looks so far here.
