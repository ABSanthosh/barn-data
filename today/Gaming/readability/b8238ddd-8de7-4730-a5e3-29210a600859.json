  "text": "Marvel Comics may publish a great many stories set across numerous versions of the Marvel Universe, but they've rarely ever released comics that are specifically set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That appears to be changing, with Marvel revealing a prequel comic for the upcoming The Fantastic Four: First Steps.Simply titled The Fantastic Four: First Steps #1, the prequel is set four years prior to the events of the film. Written by Matt Fraction (Hawkeye) and illustrated by Mark Buckingham (Fables), this standalone issue will recount the FF's debut adventure, seemingly inspired by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's original Fantastic Four #1. We know that the film is mostly skipping over the FF's origin story, so it appears that the comic will fill in for those who want to know how the team came to be. Art by Phil Noto. (Image Credit: Marvel)Here's Marvel's official description for The Fantastic Four: First Steps #1:It’s the moment that changed the world–-presented in the most brilliant medium there is! FANTASTIC FOUR: FIRST STEPS #1 is certain to be a must-have item, both for those who have looked up to this super team since they made themselves known those who might be unaware of the history behind Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch and The Thing’s incredible rise to global stardom!Four years ago, the world was transformed as an amazing cosmic-powered quartet revealed themselves and their astonishing abilities to the public! Since that time, they have become world-famous as the Fantastic Four! Now, to celebrate that anniversary, Marvel Comics recounts their very first exploit that saved our city from near destruction!\"What an honor to be asked to help celebrate the fourth anniversary of the Fantastic Four!” Fraction said in a statement. “It was a thrill to bring their first legendary adventure to the world of comic books for the first time! It's a story we all know by heart, but I think Magic Mark Buckingham and I have found a way to tell it as you've never heard or seen before -- and who knows, this could be the start of something big!\"While Fraction's comments are a tongue-in-cheek way of acknowledging that this issue is being presented as an in-universe comic book authorized by Pedro Pascal's Reed Richards and his Future Foundation, we also have to wonder if he's teasing the idea of more MCU comics. Again, apart from a handful of tie-ins to early MCU films like Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers, Marvel hasn't published many stories specifically set in the MCU. Could we be getting an Avengers: Doomsday or Spider-Man: Brand New Day prequel next?The Fantastic Four: First Steps #1 will be released on July 2, 2025, just a few weeks before the movie hits theaters. Let us know in the comments what MCU comics you'd like to read.For more on The Fantastic Four: First Steps, see why it's a big deal that Vanessa Kirby's Invisible Woman is pregnant and learn why Silver Surfer is a woman in this movie.Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.
