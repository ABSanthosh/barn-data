Here we guide you through everything you need to know about building and using the Pal Surgery Table in Palword.What is the Pal Surgery Table?The Pal Surgery Table is a new game item that you can build at your base to have more control over your Pals. If you've ever wanted to breed better quality Pals but needed a specific gender or passive skills for them, the new Pal Surgery Table is the solution you're looking for.Pal Surgery TableHow to build the Pal Surgery TableThe Pal Surgery Table is available at technology level 36, and it costs 3 points to unlock.To build, you'll need the following materials:30 Refined Ingots20 High Quality ClothHow to implant passive skillsThe Pal Surgery Table lets you implant new passive skills for your Pal. Place the Pal you want to improve in your party and interact with the surgery table. It will cost you gold plus an implant item in order to complete the procedure.Implanting passive skillsImplantsImplants are new key items found or purchased in the game. These include passive such as Hard Skin, Workaholic, Brave, Ferocious. These can be purchased from arena vendors for 30-50 battle tickets, depending on rarity. You can also get them as rewards for successful bounties. Some can seemingly be looted in chests or possibly salvaged. I had two Brave implants, but I didn't buy them from a vendor or get them from a bounty.Once you have an implant you want to use, you can select one of the Pal's passive skill slots. This can either be an existing skill you want to replace or it can be an empty slot for adding an additional skill. This will cost 10,000 - 50,000 gold each time, depending on the rarity of passive skill, and you can keep implanting these skills as long as you have the gold and implants to do so.This will allow you to build really powerful Pals for battle or breeding.How to swap a Pal's genderChanging a Pal's genderTo swap a Pal's gender, you'll need to first place the Pal in your party. Then, go to the Pal Surgery Table and select the Change Gender option. This procedure costs 1 Pal Reversal item.The Pal Reversal item is a new consumable item that can be purchased from arena vendors for 35 battle tickets or selected as a reward for a successful bounty. It's possible you might be able to collect these from salvage or chests as well.For more Palworld guides, make sure to check out how to fish for Pals and salvage, how to move Pals to different worlds, and how to upgrade your schematics.
