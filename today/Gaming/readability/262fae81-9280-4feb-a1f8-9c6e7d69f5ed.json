The Overwatch 2 X Avatar: The Last Airbender collaboration will run from December 17-30. Players can unlock Mei's Katara skin for free by completing event challenges. Gamers can also earn player icons, themed sprays, and voice lines that \"capture the wisdom and iconic moments of Avatar: The Last Airbender.\"Overwatch 2 Season 14 premiered earlier this week, and it introduced a new character named Hazard, a tank hero who has the ability to create artificial walls during battles. Season 14 features the return of Winter Wonderland, including Mei's Snowball Offensive and Freezethaw Elimination. But this part of Season 14 will only last until January 6. Additionally, Season 14 will temporarily bring back 6v6 player matches as a test. There's going to be a separate 6v6 player test later this season that will bring back the classic 2-2-2 role composition with some additional changes. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?
