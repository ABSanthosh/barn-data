  "text": "Image credit: RAC7 A new report has lend further credence to last year's claims Apple is working on game-focused iOS app that'll integrate store, social features, achievements and more - with the company now said to be \"seeking to sell gamers and developers on the idea that it’s a leader in the market.\" Word that Apple was looking to expand its gaming strategy with a dedicated iOS app first surfaced last year, when news site 9to5 Mac reported efforts were underway at the company to combine the functionality of iOS' App Store and its long-defunct Game Center service - which previously offered a centralised place to view likes of challenges, leaderboards, and achievements before the app was removed from iOS in 2016. And now, eight months later, Bloomberg has corroborated 9to5's story with a similar report, saying Apple is looking to preinstall the new gaming app on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV set-top boxes later this year. There's also talk of a Mac version, capable of displaying games downloaded outside of the App Store. As in 9to5's earlier report, Bloomberg - citing \"people with knowledge of the matter\" - says the app will serve as a launcher for games and centralise in-game achievements, leaderboards, communications, and other activities. Sneaky Sasquatch Trailer — Apple Arcade Apple now owns Sneaky Sasquatch developer RAC7.Watch on YouTube It'll reportedly also feature internally produced editorial content highlighting new games available within the app, which will include those from the App Store's game section and the company's Apple Arcade game subscription service. Bloomberg says the app is due to launch as part of Apple's next iOS version, iOS 19, and will be showcased during the company's Worldwide Developers Conference on 9th June ahead of a September arrival. Apple's push to create a prominent games destination for iOS users does, of course, follow the EU's mandate last year that Apple must allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on its devices to comply with the Digital Markets Act. Since then, a number of third-party marketplaces have taken advantage of the EU's new rules, most notably the Epic Games Store. A new game-focused iOS app from Apple would mark another small step in the company's slowly evolving gaming strategy, which has so far included the launch of its Apple Arcade games subscription service in 2019, new tools to help developer easily port their Mac games to iOS, and even a push to woo major publishers like Capcom and Ubisoft onto its platform in recent years - although efforts to sell full-price AAA games such as Resident Evil 7, Death Stranding, and Assassin's Creed Mirage to iOS users have reportedly proved disappointing. Reports of Apple's new app come as the company announces its first video game studio acquisition. It now owns RAC7, the two-person studio responsible for Apple Arcade hit Sneaky Sasquatch - although an Apple spokesperson told Digital Trends the move was a \"unique circumstance\", as it saw an opportunity to help the team grow its game further.",
