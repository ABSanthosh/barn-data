It’s a 421-piece set that, when built, looks like a near 1:1 scale replica of Nintendo’s gaming handheld. The set includes buildable Game Boy Game Pak cartridges for Super Mario Land and The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening. It will release October 1 for $59.99. It's available for preorder at Amazon and the LEGO Store.LEGO Game BoyLEGO Game BoyThe set looks pretty much just like a Game Boy, complete with a D-pad, plus A, B, Start, and Select buttons. It also has contrast and volume dials on the sides. You can choose between three options for what’s on the Game Boy’s display: a Nintendo start screen or gameplay images from the two included games. The LEGO Game Boy has an age recommendation of 18+, putting it in the LEGO sets for adults category. That’s probably because it’s a nostalgic set aimed at people who had a Game Boy as kids. It’s also worth noting that, unlike some other sets, there are no light or sound features here, and you can’t actually play games on it. LEGO Game BoyThis is a set that’s meant to be displayed. To that end, it also includes a brick-built stand for the Game Boy replica, and another stand for whichever cartridge you don’t have slotted into the back of the device that’s being “played.”This isn’t the first retro-themed Nintendo LEGO set the company has released. The LEGO Nintendo Entertainment System came out in 2020, and a pixelated SNES-era LEGO Mario \u0026 Yoshi set released last year. Additionally, there are tons of play-focused LEGO Mario sets, as well as LEGO Animal Crossing sets, a LEGO Great Deku Tree from Zelda, and many more.Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.
