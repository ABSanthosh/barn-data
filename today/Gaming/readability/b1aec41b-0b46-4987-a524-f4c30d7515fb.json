  "description": "We're deep into Fortnite Remix Chapter 2 now, which means Fortnite Chapter 6 is oh so close to kicking us into a new era of Epic Games' metaverse in December. We don't have an extremely clear picture yet of what we can expect in Chapter 6, but we do have enough info through leaks and official announcements that we can put together an early picture for you.After the full 2024 roadmap was leaked back in the spring, Epic has been pretty good about plugging any further leaks about what's in store for Fortnite's future. Despite knowing for six months that Snoop Dogg would be the headliner for this Festival season, for example, very few other details about Remix season slipped out before the official announcements the week the season launched.But the first season of Chapter 6 will be a literal game-changer, just as the previous chapter launches were, and it's tough to keep all that under wraps as we approach the launch, particularly as traces of upcoming content make their way into the game files. Let's dig into what we know so far about Fortnite Chapter 6. Fortnite Chapter 6 launch dateFortnite Remix Chapter 2 is scheduled to end overnight on the evening of November 30 (US time), with Chapter 6 Season 1 presumed to then kick off on the morning of December 1. Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix finale eventThere will be some kind of major live event, seemingly a concert involving the late Juice WRLD, on Saturday, November 30, the last day of the season. Epic will incentivize folks to play by offering everyone a free Juice WRLD skin for logging in that day. While the timing hasn't been announced yet, Epic tends to run Saturday live events at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET. What to expect in Fortnite Chapter 6There are certain changes that accompany every new Chapter launch in Fortnite. There will be an entirely new map for battle royale, as well as a refreshed loot pool made up of new weapons that we've never had before. We don't have a ton of specifics, but leakers say the new map will feature environments and architecture inspired by Asian countries. Could we see the return of Mega City? Fingers crossed.A couple of features that were planned to be released during the Remix season--the shoe cosmetics and the ability to use the Festival jam feature in the lobby--will go live during Chapter 6, hopefully at launch.A long-awaited quality-of-life improvement should be ready during Chapter 6: the thin client. This will give players new, granular options for installing Fortnite that will allow folks to only install the parts of Fortnite they want. So if you only play Festival, for example, you'll be able to just download that. Players can already do this to some extent on PC, but this change will add more options, and also will allow console users to take advantage of them. This may not happen at Season 6's launch, but it's definitely on the way.And, in very exciting news for anybody who's been feeling overwhelmed by how much stuff is in the item shop, we'll soon be able to filter the shop to make it a lot easier to find what we're looking for. Fortnite OG OGA week after Chapter 6 launches, Epic will add another permanent throwback battle royale mode, a true rehash of the early days of Fortnite. This new version of Fortnite OG will start at Season 1 and cycle through one season per month, and may be a more faithful recreation of the OG experience.While Epic has officially announced this mode, the company was light on details. We don't know, for example, if this mode will have a Zero Build version. But since Epic likely announced this mode earlier than planned after it leaked, we probably won't find out much more until Chapter 6 launches. Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 1 battle passLeakers have indicated that Chapter 6 will lean into Japanese mythology similar to how Chapter 5 dealt with Greek myths. That could mean we'll have a battle pass full of Japanese gods and goddesses, but we don't yet have any specific details. But multiple leakers have independently confirmed this. Fortnite Chapter 6 collabsWe don't currently have any leaks about specific upcoming collaboration skins in Chapter 6, but Marvel Rivals, the hero shooter launching December 6, will have some sort of collab cosmetics in Fortnite--likely a new Marvel skin or two in the cel-shaded Marvel Rivals style. Meanwhile, a reliable Rocket League leaker indicates a large number of existing collaboration cars will cross over to Fortnite soon. Scroll to the next section for more about that. Rocket Racing in Fortnite Chapter 6We aren't expecting a major refresh for Rocket Racing when Chapter 6 begins, but it seems as though a bunch of existing Rocket League cars may be crossing over to Fortnite in the near future, including: Lightning McQueen from Cars, the Fast \u0026 Furious Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat, the Volkswagen Golf GTI, the Nissan Silvia, the Lamborghini Countach LPI, the McLaren 570s and the Ferrari 296 GTB, and the Battle Bus. And on top of that, we've been expecting Mater from Cars to be added to both Fortnite and Rocket League for a while now, but since SUV and truck cosmetics don't currently affect BR, he'll presumably be a Chapter 6 thing.Two of the above cars, the Golf and the Silvia, were previously available from past Rocket Passes, which makes them surprise additions here--they may not be able to sell them in the item shop. But what's cool about those two cars is that they were on Rocket Passes that you could get with Fortnite Crew--meaning there are a lot of folks who probably have them without realizing it. Fortnite Festival in Chapter 6Fortnite Festival Season 6 featuring Snoop Dogg will continue until mid-January, and so Festival may not be affected all that much by the chapter launch. But leakers have been reporting for months that the headliner for Season 7, starting in January, will be the K-pop girl group NewJeans, who will get the standard Music Pass/item shop treatment.Dataminers have indicated that some Festival instruments will soon be usable as back blings and pickaxes--not the most shocking development since there are already a number of guitar and mic stand pickaxes and back blings in the game, but it'll be nice to get some extra utility from those purchases. Fortnite Creative in Chapter 6The long-gestating first-person camera-- which is different from the workaround to mimic this feature utilize--will reportedly finally be available for Fortnite creators starting in Chapter 6, which will open up all sorts of new avenues for user-created games and experiences. It will probably take a little while for creators to harness this tool in an interesting way, but in the long term this will be a huge boon for Fortnite Creative.",
