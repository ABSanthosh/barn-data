  "text": "With Sniper Elite: Resistance available from today on Xbox Game Pass, Xbox and Windows PC, we thought it would be a great time to give you some hints and tips for when you join the Resistance. Find Your Playstyle One of the key tenants of the Sniper Elite franchise is the freedom we give to you, the player. We want you to be able to approach every mission, objective and scenario in a way that suits how you want to play the game. You may be the kind of player who is extremely stealthy, taking their time to plan out each and every attack. Using binoculars to mark every enemy you see, planning your assault and taking out the enemies you need to from distance and cover. Conversely you may be more “shock and awe” in your approach as you blow up a nearby vehicle and let the bullets fly as you steam in. The choice is completely up to you. Adapt to Achieve Your Objective The key here is being able to adapt on the fly, no matter your approach. Make sure you have a balanced loadout and are prepared for the scenario you are about to face. Even if you are a ‘run and gun’ style player, it never hurts to plan – even just a little. Use the tools at your disposal, including your binoculars and focus, mark your enemies by hovering over them and then choose your approach before executing. But, be prepared for things to go wrong. Know where the alarms are and have an exit strategy, even if that’s just to let the bullets fly from an SMG as you run for cover. Take Time to Understand Your Hunting Ground The main Campaign in Sniper Elite: Resistance encompasses eight missions – all playable in single player and with a friend via online co-op. Each mission in is set in its own large, sprawling map in different locations behind enemy lines in France. While your primary objective will be clearly marked, there is so much more for you to discover. Taking the time to explore the map, search enemy soldiers, and keeping an eagle eye for opportunities and hidden secrets will bring its rewards. You can discover additional objectives, unlock new insertion points, gain additional back story and mission information as well as discovering easter eggs. Propaganda Missions Each mission also has a Resistance poster hidden within the map. Once you find it you will unlock a separate Propaganda Mission. Here you play as a member of the Resistance in a variety of challenges, all against the clock. These smaller, repeatable levels will test your stealth, combat or sniping. Each of the challenges has its own set of rules, weapons and scoring to vary the experience. Keep on playing to get the highest score possible and unlock medals and new weapons. We think you are really going to enjoy them. Choose Your Weapon As you would expect from a Sniper Elite game you have an arsenal of authentic World War 2 weaponry at your disposal, including some old favourites and new entries to the series. These weapons are combined with our best-in-class ballistics and the series defining X-Ray Kill Cam which lets you reveal in the destruction caused by your sniping prowess. Weapon unlocks can be earned by finding the workbenches that are hidden within each of the Campaign maps. These workbenches will not only give you access to new weaponry, but they also unlock a number of customisation options. They allow you to alter your loadout, which can be incredibly helpful mid-mission. You may find that you need to increase the zoom capability of your scope or add a silencer to your side arm, all options are open. Take the Fight Online Again, this is where exploring and gathering as much intel as possible is vital to success. Knowing the maps and the various vantage points and hiding places can also be hugely advantageous, especially when Invasion mode is enabled. This optional game mode allows players to ‘invade’ another person’s campaign mission as an enemy sniper tasked with eliminating the lead player. No matter which side you are on, there are additional tools you can utilise to gain information on your opponent’s location. As the invader you can instruct the AI soldier’s to be extra vigilant and report back if they spot the host player to reveal their position. As the host player you can use the telephones dotted around the map to gain intel on the invader. However, be careful when you use them as overuse will in-turn give away your position. On top of this, we have a suite of adversarial online multiplayer options for up to 16 players, including a favourite for the snipers amongst us, No Cross. You can also join up to three other players to take on waves of enemies in Survival Mode. There’s certainly a lot for you to get stuck into so grab your rifle and join the Resistance! We really hope you enjoy the game. Sniper Elite: Resistance is available today on Game Pass, Xbox and Windows PC. Pre-order the Sniper Elite: Resistance standard edition now and receive: • Target Führer – Lights, Camera, Achtung campaign mission • 1x weapon skin • Karabiner 98 Rifle NEW OPERATIVE, NEW THREAT, NEW EPIC CAMPAIGN Offering unparalleled sniping mechanics, stealth and tactical third-person combat, Sniper Elite: Resistance turns the attention of the award-winning series towards a hidden war, far from the front lines, deep within the heart of occupied France. In a gripping new story that runs parallel with Sniper Elite 5, Harry Hawker, agent of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), takes the lead for the first time as he discovers an insidious new Wunderwaffe – something so powerful, it guarantees the Nazis will win the war. Working with the French Resistance, this deadly addition to the Reich's arsenal must be eliminated. Multiple Kill List targets, and different infiltration and extraction points give you an unequalled choice with how to accomplish objectives and create your own playstyle. The full campaign can also be experienced in co-op. Fight against the Nazi war machine with an ally to share weapons, items and tactical know-how, as well as help each other get back in the fight when you go down during firefights. VISCERAL X-RAY KILL CAM AND ADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS The trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing the true destructive power of every one of your signature shots. Bones deflect bullets to unpredictably rip new paths through enemy bodies and SMGs and pistols also trigger kill cams, showing multiple bullet shots in dramatic slow motion. To land that shot you will need to think like a true sniper. Factor in rifle stock and barrel options along with gravity, wind and heart rate while you zero your sights on the target. AUTHENTIC WORLD WAR II WEAPONS AND CUSTOMISATION The arsenal at your disposal will feature returning franchise favourites as well as a host of new authentic WWII weapons. Picking your loadout will be key to striking down the Reich’s nefarious plans! Customise your weapon to suit your operating style. Find workbenches scattered around the campaign to customise and upgrade your rifles, secondaries and pistols with new scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more. Also remember to pick the right ammo for the right job, whether you need armour-piercing shells or a non-lethal takedown. PROPAGANDA MISSIONS – BE THE RESISTANCE Locate unique Propaganda posters across the main campaign and step into the shoes of a French Resistance fighter in all new Propaganda missions. During these scenarios, sneak, snipe and take down enemies to complete time-sensitive objectives and help end the Nazi occupation. AXIS INVASION MODE The fan-favourite Axis Invasion mode is back! invade another player’s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse. Whether you stalk your prey, lay an ambush, or run in guns blazing, the threat of invasion provides a new dimension to the campaign’s challenge. TENSE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER When you’ve mastered your rifle, customise your character and loadout as you take the fight online in competitive 16-player battles to earn XP, medals and ribbons. If competition isn’t your style, you can also team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode.",
