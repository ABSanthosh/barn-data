  "text": "SummaryOutbreak Shades of Horror Chromatic Split launches on Xbox Series X|S today.Compelling and twisted narrative, devious puzzles, thoughtful inventory management, and endless dark secrets.Special bonus modes include action-packed scenarios for a more arcade-style experience. Happy Halloween, Survivors! My name is Julia Wolbach, Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of Dead Drop Studios.  Today we are launching our next-generation survival horror bloodbath, Outbreak Shades of Horror Chromatic Split, on Xbox Series X|S. As Detective Lydia Daniels, players will begin in a sprawling sewer system beneath the city of Cypress Ridge on the eve of a massive zombie apocalypse.  Players must explore, solve puzzles, and take advantage of their limited resources to survive in an ever-changing world filled with dangerous enemy zombies and a recurring, massive monster. Dare to Explore an Underground Labyrinth Alone and Afraid. Initially, players will be unarmed and at the mercy of the environment before discovering a repertoire of melee weapons and firearms such as the lead pipe and the shotgun.  These and other key items will give players a fighting chance and also open up new and secret areas to explore in the game’s colossal maps.  Resourceful players can find crafting items to create healing items, ammunition, and even precious ink for saving their game.  For example, players can use unique types of gunpowder and shell casings to fabricate different types of ammo, or in a pinch, players can combine gunpowder with a virus kit to produce antiviral items.  Explore a multitude of different crafting combos to manufacture the valuable supplies needed to ride out the zombie storm! Play in Third Person or Through Lydia’s Eyes. Players can switch between first person and third person perspectives at any time as they fight to survive in a ruthless world.  If you’re looking to fully immerse yourself in Lydia’s journey, first person view may be your cup of tea, while if you enjoy more of a traditional survival horror experience, third person view will provide you with a full look at your character.  Utilize melee combat to try and stagger foes and sneak by, or use your limited bullets to carefully place shots that can dismember and severely cripple zombies’ offensive options.  Be warned, as enemy zombies can stun you or even knock you over, leaving you vulnerable to an unholy beating!   Explore and carefully take advantage of your tools to open new pathways and discover a bevy of secrets, such as bonus crafting items and more. Strategize and Think Quickly to Best Utilize Your Limited Items. Lydia’s supplies will be limited, so she’ll need to find materials to give herself a fighting chance!  Combine gunpowder with other items to create ink for saving, items for healing, additional bullets, antiviral solutions, and more.  Lydia can’t afford to shoot first and think later, so think carefully about how you use your items!  Will you consume raw gunpowder in an act of desperation to bail yourself out in the moment, or will you wait to find an empty ink canister so you can save your progress?  Inventory space is also limited, so take time to optimize your pocket space and put excess items in linked item boxes occasionally found throughout the game for later use.  Remember that opening your inventory to combine components will pause the game, but to reload your weapon you must find a safe spot to hide in the cruel, chaotic underground of Cypress Ridge! Satiating Side Content Expands the Breadth of Gameplay. Once you’re done with Lydia’s campaign, there’s still more fun to be had!  Unlock an additional wild campaign for a more action-oriented game style. Try out the Onslaught and Besieged modes for arcade zombie-splatting fun against piles of enemies on unique maps.  Looming Dread Mode challenges you to survive and clear a unique scenario in as fast a time as possible.  You can also replay Lydia’s campaign in New Game Plus to keep all of your upgrades from the end of the story or enjoy built-in Developer Commentary!  Can you find all of Chromatic Split’s hidden achievements and cheat codes? Will you Save Cypress Ridge or Die Trying? With so much content and multiple replayable modes all horrifyingly crafted in Unreal Engine 5, the standalone Outbreak Shades of Horror Chromatic Split is the perfect way to prepare for the main Outbreak: Shades of Horror game releasing soon episodically.  On the eve of a massive zombie outbreak, can Lydia survive long enough to help her city in its time of need? Dead Drop Studios LLC $24.99 Cypress Ridge – September 28,1999 Go back to the beginning of the end in the prologue to Dead Drops’ Studios upcoming Outbreak: Shades of Horror. Play as both the heroes and the villains of the outbreak as you attempt both to avoid an outbreak of epic proportions and to stop word from getting out. As Lydia, a veteran police officer, race against time through the Cypress Ridge sewers to spread the truth of the Outbreak before it’s too late but beware there is more than sludge and rats waiting for her. As Hank, keep sight of your target while navigating rooftop of insanity as he tries to stop the truth from coming to the surface. But remember, the higher you are, the harder you fall when the zombies attack! Leads into the upcoming Outbreak: Shades of Horror, a spiritual successor to online survival horror from the early 2000s.",
