Opportunities done The monthly goal required 12 total days, with a special reward offered every three days. AIR Daily tasks longer term goals… The special rewards were of various values of “special.”  4,500 EverMarks were just so much noise, and SKINR pieces… well, they aren’t exactly expensive on the market, which should tell you something.  8 million ISK and 5 PLEX… 25-30 million ISK in value… wasn’t bad.  But the overall goal worth obtaining were the 225K skill points for the 12th and final day. CCP has made skill points a commodity… we’re so far past the one-time promise of every skill point in game being trained and now CCP just straight up sells them in the cash shop when they aren’t handing them out like candy… but they are still a valuable commodity for enabling your character.  Skill points still unlock character capabilities and the temptation of skill points will drive player behavior.  All that stuff going on in Uitra every month on the MER?  All about skill points. (I have an update based on new info coming when the November MER drops.) Anyway, we got that in June and the response was… mild. So CCP was all, “We can fix this!  We can make this better or more popular or something!”  So we ended up with eight daily tasks to choose from, a selection which often contained duplicates. Double your daily goal options! That made things easier… probably too easy, but nobody complains about skill points coming too easy except for old cranks like me who shake their fist and mutter about the old days when we didn’t even have a skill queue. When I say “too easy” I speak from personal experience.  In October, due to the big move, I activated a third account and managed to get all eight characters across those three accounts all their daily goals done for the full set of rewards over the last two months.  This was largely due to getting doubled up on the 50 LP task most days, which allowed a high sec alt to fleet up with two null sec characters and run a mission that distributed LP to all three.  Piece of cake. Meanwhile, the Revenant expansion promised to allow people to get their AIR daily goals in with EverMarks, a semi-useless in-game currency that came in with the Uprising expansion which could only be used for corporation and alliance emblems on your ships.  That isn’t a BAD use, but earning EverMarks was a pain and emblems weren’t even available on that many ships to start with. CCP did get more hulls in the program, but the missions for EverMarks… I could go down a rabbit hole with that… sucked to the point that CCP just started giving away EverMarks with reward situation including, as pointed out above, the AIR opportunities. When Revenant hit, some promised items were mission… though not as many as with Equinox I guess… including the EverMarks for AIR stuff.  Well, that landed yesterday.  From the patch notes: Paying EM to complete Air Daily Goals: We are continuing to refine the Air Daily Goals system and with this update, player now have the option to complete Air Daily Goals with EverMarks. This added flexibility makes earning the Daily Bonus SP and progressing through the Monthly Reward Track faster and easier – perfect for players with limited playtime. So you can now pay with EverMarks.  It will run you 2,500 EverMarks per task to complete them, which is fine I guess, since how often would you need to do that? Come on, it is just 2,500 EverMarks What with 8 tasks to choose from and often having duplicate goals to cover, this might be more of an escape hatch to get in that last goal right? But CCP wasn’t done yet.  If they couldn’t just make EverMarks an option.  They decided to nerf AIR opportunities to make sure you need to use EverMarks more often.  Moving on in the patch notes: Streamlined Daily Goals: The total number of goals per day has been reduce from 8 to 4, with one goal from each career path. Unique Goals Every Day: No duplicate goals are distributed on a given day, making sure that each of the 4 goals offered each day is different. Career Pool Adjustments: The “Manufacture an Item” goal has been removed from the Explorer Career pool. The “Scan 5 Signatures” goal has been removed from the Industrialist Career pool. CCP has “streamlined” the daily goals by going back to only four goals being available a day.  Having only four goals was a problem back during the summer, but now it is an opportunity to get you to spend EverMarks. Back to four goals, this time no dupes Also, in addition to only four goals, they want to assure you that there will be no more duplicate goals.  The happy days of easy AIR daily goals are over, for me at least.  I am sure there will be days when there are two goals that are not too tough to get done.  But for my null sec characters… three of which are logged out in space as part of an ongoing operation… I won’t be bothering.  And I was only doing my high sec alts daily to enable the null sec characters, so for me the summer of skill points is over. Oh well.  Anything easy will get abused in New Eden until it gets nerfed.  That is the law of the space jungle. But the whole thing smacks of CCP trying to achieve one goal… in this case, make EverMarks relevant… while once again ignoring the overall ecosystem. Players have piles of EverMarks because they don’t care about them.  I’ve bought about all the alliance emblems I am going to at this point.  So there was a glut, largely caused by CCP handing them out so freely… which it had to do because the missions for EverMarks, as noted above, suck.  They are bad and not worth doing and after a couple I swore I’d rather not have emblems on my ship that ever do one of those missions again. So now CCP has potentially added an EverMark sink, but there is no reliable, in-game EverMark faucet.  The faucet was CCP.  So is CCP just going to continue pumping EverMarks into the economy via login rewards and Twitch drops? EverMarks and SKINR stuff… the detritus of CCP Twitch Drops And if so… if CCP had to create a sink to absorb the faucet they themselves created… what is the point?  I mean, worst case scenario, getting your 12 days of goals done entirely with EverMarks is 60K in EverMarks you need to come up with.  And even if there is one doable goal often enough, the no dupes means that 30K might not be an unrealistic price… less the EverMarks you earn as rewards… because those are still a thing? In fact, the rewards haven’t changed since Equinox and they are, skill points aside, a bit stale.  Again, the market is flooded with SKINR stuff and EverMarks are… well, I could just do without them. Anyway, given all of that, I expect that there will be an update to this in the near future.  Having only four options was, as noted, a problem back during the summer, and that problem didn’t magically go away, while the EverMark economy will now just be more broken than it was before. As I always say, we shall see.  Until then, I’ll just go collect my weekly 15K skill points from the in-game store… because, as I said, CCP is always handing us skill points one way or another.",

be no more duplicate goals.  The happy days of easy AIR daily goals are over, for me at least.  I am sure there will be days when there are two goals that are not too tough to get done.  But for my null sec characters… three of which are logged out in space as part of an ongoing operation… I won’t be bothering.  And I was only doing my high sec alts daily to enable the null sec characters, so for me the summer of skill points is over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh well.  Anything easy will get abused in New Eden until it gets nerfed.  That is the law of the space jungle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the whole thing smacks of CCP trying to achieve one goal… in this case, make EverMarks relevant… while once again ignoring the overall ecosystem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlayers have piles of EverMarks because they don’t care about them.  I’ve bought about all the alliance emblems I am going to at this point.  So there was a glut, largely caused by CCP handing them out so freely… which it had to do because the missions for EverMarks, as noted above, suck.  They are bad and not worth doing and after a couple I swore I’d rather not have emblems on my ship that ever do one of those missions again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now CCP has potentially added an EverMark sink, but there is no reliable, in-game EverMark faucet.  The faucet was CCP.  So is CCP just going to continue pumping EverMarks into the economy via login rewards and Twitch drops?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\"

days of goals done entirely with EverMarks is 60K in EverMarks you need to come up with.  And even if there is one doable goal often enough, the no dupes means that 30K might not be an unrealistic price… less the EverMarks you earn as rewards… because those are still a thing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, the rewards haven’t changed since \u003cem\u003eEquinox\u003c/em\u003e and they are, skill points aside, a bit stale.  Again, the market is flooded with SKINR stuff and EverMarks are… well, I could just do without them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, given all of that, I expect that there will be an update to this in the near future.  Having only four options was, as noted, a problem back during the summer, and that problem didn’t magically go away, while the EverMark economy will now just be more broken than it was before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I always say, we shall see.  Until then, I’ll just go collect my weekly 15K skill points from the in-game store… because, as I said, CCP is always handing us skill points one way or another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
