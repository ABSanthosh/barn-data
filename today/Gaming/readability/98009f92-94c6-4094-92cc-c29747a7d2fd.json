They joined Polygon in 2022.Dreams on a Pillow is a video game experience about the 1948 Nakba, an event where roughly 700,000 people were displaced from their land and homes due to Zionist occupation.The game, described as “a pseudo-3D stealth adventure game about a land full of people being made into a people without land,” is from Palestinian developer Rasheed Abu-Eideh. But before I tell you more about that, let me tell you about his previous game. In 2016, Abu-Eideh released Liyla and the Shadows of War, a game about a 2014 assault on Gaza by Israel, known as Operation Protective Edge. Liyla follows a Palestinian girl and her family as they navigate attacks in their neighborhood. It’s short but emotional, and it blends elements of platformers and choose-your-own-adventure storytelling. In 2021, the game was a part of an Indie Bundle Pack that raised nearly $900,000 for Palestinian aid through UNRWA USA. Currently, Liyla and the Shadows of War is free on mobile and Windows. But back in 2016, it was initially rejected as a game in the Apple App Store. Abu-Eideh was told to remove all description of it as a “Game” and re-categorize it as “News” or “Reference” due to its political nature. The hypocrisy of the decision was noted by many at the time: As reported by Eurogamer, Apple denied Liyla as a game, but allowed a game called Israeli Heroes in the game section. After Abu-Eideh spoke about Apple’s decision on social media, Apple finally allowed Liyla to be categorized as a game.Dreams on a Pillow is currently being crowdfunded by Abu-Eideh on LaunchGood till Jan. 13, and funds raised from the LaunchGood campaign will go towards asset creation, outsourcing, and salaries for the current team of 9 individuals. The game is aiming to launch in Q4 2026.",
