Fantasy Critic League – Like Fantasy Football, but for Video Games There is a post with most of the details already, but for a quick review here is what you need to do if you wish to join: Go to Fantasy Critic League and create an account Click on this link, which will invite you to join the TAGN League Follow the instructions which includes creating a publisher that represents you Click on the Auto Draft link in the side bar and turn that on Optional – Create a Watch List of titles you are interested in Profit! That is the minimum level of participation required and there is even an optional item on the list.  Also, as the league manager I can turn on Auto Draft for you if you cannot find it. If you do that you can get away with doing nothing else if you like.  The right first picks can set you up. So far we have nine people signed up including myself.  That is a pretty decent number.  I was worried for a bit that it might just be Potshot, Bhagpuss, and I, but some more people have wandered in.  I think 10-14 would be an ideal number as that makes it less likely that one or two people are going to be able to jump on the obvious early picks.  I mean, not to give away the store, but Civilization VII is at the top of my watch list.  That has both the advantage of a concrete ship date and a reasonably high likelihood of a good score. The maximum league size is 20.  I don’t think we’ll get there, but things are supposed to get a little crazy past 14 according to the FAQ, which I have linked below. The draft tomorrow, which is still planned for 11:00 Pacific time (19:00 UTC), will involve people picking their first five titles in rotation. That will involve me doing two things.  The first is to his the big “randomize draft order” button, that will shake everybody up into a different lineup.  So what you see today is not what you will see after I do that unless the RNG gods are feeling particularly capricious. Once that is set, I will then hit the big “start draft” button.  At that point, anybody who has auto draft configured will attempt to either get the highest ranked game on their watch list or the game with the highest hype factor from the total list. So it is very much a strategy to just let the game grab what it thinks is the best stuff and ride with that. For those wishing to do this real fantasy league draft style, I will be up on the voice channel on the TAGN Discord server (join here) to talk through the options and see what happens.  I suspect it will be just myself, Potshot, and maybe Cyanbane in there, but we’ll see. The TAGN Discord also has a “tagn-fantasy-critic-league” channel that is hooked up to the league and will narrate changes and bids and such. Once the initial draft is done… and it will likely go pretty quickly if most people are auto drafting… there will be additional things you can do. You can, if you think you have gotten a lemon pick, drop it… at least until the point when it launches.  Once it launches you are stuck with it.  You can drop any title without a release date, but are limited to dropping just 4 titles that have a launch date set. You will also have four additional slots to fill and a budget of $100 to spend on buying titles for those slots.  If you have already filled up all nine of your slots but want something else, you will need to do a conditional drop, which will drop a selected title if you get the one you want. And then there are the counter picks.  A counter pick is a game from someone else’s roster, but instead of getting points for it, you lose points for it.   Counter picks are bets that a game will do poorly or will not release.  Also, as an added bit of spice, once you counter pick a title that somebody else has picked they will no longer be able to drop it.  So that should be fun… or awful.  We shall see. Everybody gets one counter pick and you should fill it as not doing so will cost you 15 points.  You also need to fill it by November 1st, so you have some time, but not forever.   However, since it has to be a title from somebody’s roster, the options are limited. Bids for picks or counter picks get processed every Saturday, so there will be a week before the first one hits.  The Discord channel will announce which ones are in play on Thursday and the results on Saturday once they are complete. The Discord channel, which can honestly get a bit chirpy so muting it might be an option, will also announce when new titles are eligible to be drafted.  It is a constant feed of video game information. At the end of the draft Saturday the game will also project winners based on the current hype status of games chosen.  Do not panic if you are last.  In our test league with Liore I was projected for last place for most of season and came in third out of seven.  I think Liore, who came in first, was projected for last at a few points. For those who want to know more or read up on the rules, the following links are suggestions: Fantasy Critic Site Fantasy Critic How to Play Fantasy Critic FAQ Hype Factor Podcast – Episode 1 – The Basics of Fantasy Critic Hype Factor Podcast – Episode 2 – Picking for 2025 You should also go to the TAGN League page and look at the league options as they are set.  Some tags have been banned, so you will not be able to pick titles that are, for example, already in early access. For the draft, my general gut is that titles with set launch dates are better, expansions can be a bit iffy because they sometimes do not get enough reviews to warrant a score so you get zero, and that reliable publishers tend to be reliable. The Hype Factor podcast duo did point out that the highest review scores tend to go to break-out indy titles like Balatro.  But how do you spot those in advance? The goal for all of this is to have some fun and give me something to post about maybe once a month until we get down to the wire.  Also I suspect that, as happened with Fantasy Movie League, we’ll all come out on the far end a lot more knowledgeable about video game launches.  Then look out if we do a 2026 league! There is a little more than 24 hours between now and the draft.  Good luck and we’ll see who wins.",
