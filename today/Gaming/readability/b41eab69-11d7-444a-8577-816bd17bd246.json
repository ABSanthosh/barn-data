  "description": "Jeez! It’s December already? Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! Rosie is NOT ready. Tabs handled the holidays differently. He was a total pro about it, planned everything out months in advance. His Christmas plans were always well underway by August. But Rosie didn’t even begin to take Christmas seriously until this weekend, and now she’s frantic! Wait — did I say frantic? 😂 I meant “totally uninterested and really fantastic.” Seriously, she isn’t bothered about it at all. She has three PhDs and a feline Nobel Prize. Rosie spends her days researching climate change and nuclear fusion. She isn’t worried about planning for Christmas. I’m sure she’ll pull something amazing together in the last few days. #bosskitty Marnie, on the other hand, has no idea what’s going on. 😂 Deputy Derp, reporting for duty!
