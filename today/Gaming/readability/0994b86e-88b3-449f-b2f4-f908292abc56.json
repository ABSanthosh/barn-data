  "text": "Dock your wallet on these Prime Day deals Amazon’s dropped a ton of Prime Day deals on Steam Deck docks, and these are worth a look. Most of these are 20% to 45% off, with solid options for everything from budget setups to full desktop replacements. If you’re not a Prime member, Amazon’s offering a 30-day free trial so you can grab these deals without spending extra. Just sign up, check out, and cancel if you want. No pressure, just cheaper docks while the clock’s ticking. I noticed this one has HDMI 2.0, three USB 3.0 ports, Gigabit Ethernet, and 100W USB-C charging. It works with both the Steam Deck OLED and ROG Ally, which gives it some nice flexibility. It’s marked down to $24.50 from $44.99, and that 46% off caught my attention fast. This has the basics covered: USB-C charging, HDMI out, three USB-A 3.0 ports, and wired internet. It’s clean, reliable, and now sitting at $29.99 instead of $49.99. I don’t usually see this model under 30 bucks. The 9-in-1 version adds SD and microSD slots, DisplayPort, and audio output alongside the core ports. It’s more of an all-in-one dock for people who don’t want to swap cables. The deal price is $37.99, down from $59.99. What stood out here was the HDMI 2.1 port that handles 4K at 144Hz. That’s not common in this price range. It also includes USB 3.0 ports and Ethernet, and right now it’s just $26.10, which is a solid drop from the $39.99 list price. This dock was made for switching between Steam Deck OLED and ROG Ally. It supports 4K at 120Hz and has both USB-C and USB-A for charging and peripherals. It’s down to $43.69 from $59.99, which helps if you’re looking for high refresh rate support without jumping into premium docks. This one goes all-in with dual HDMI, DisplayPort, multiple USB-A and USB-C ports, Ethernet, and SD card readers. It even adds audio in and out and throws in RGB lighting for setups that care about looks too. It dropped from $79.99 to $59.98. This dock doesn’t include a charger, but if you already have one, you get the same USB and HDMI support for a lot less. The current price is $29.97, marked down from $39.99. Not bad if you’re building around what you already own. Similar idea here, just with more ports than the 6-in-1. You get USB-C data, Ethernet, dual USB-A, HDMI, and SD slots. It’s now $29.98 instead of $39.99, and it’s a clean pick for someone with a power adapter ready to go. This is the version that includes the GaN charger in the box. It’s useful if you want one cable to handle video and power at the same time. It’s currently $55.99, down from $69.99, which brings the charger cost down quite a bit. This one adds an M.2 NVMe slot inside the dock, so you get expanded storage without a separate drive case. It also handles HDMI out, Ethernet, USB 3.0, and charging. It’s on sale for $71.99, which is 20% off the usual $89.99. This one’s packed. Dual HDMI, DisplayPort, audio out, SD card reader, Ethernet, and a full lineup of USB ports. It’s got RGB too if you want the lights. Right now it’s going for $68.79, down from $85.99. If you’ve got a cluttered setup, this clears a lot of it up. Here you get an internal SSD slot and a full suite of ports. The M.2 support makes a difference if you’re low on Steam Deck storage but don’t want to keep unplugging drives. It’s down to $63.99 from $79.99. It combines a 100W USB-C charger with a proper docking station, which saves desk space and cable mess. The discount brings it to $55.99 instead of $65.99. It’s built for people who want to dock once and be done. This is a straightforward dock that keeps things simple. HDMI, USB 3.0, Ethernet, and charging passthrough all work without hassle. It’s currently $31.19, which is a solid drop from the regular $39.99. This one has a cleaner look than most, and still gives you USB-A, HDMI, Ethernet, and power passthrough. The $31.99 price is a nice cut from $39.99, especially if you’re trying to keep your setup compact. Anker keeps it simple and reliable. You’re getting just the core ports here, but with their usual build quality. The deal knocks it down to $25.49 from $29.99. That’s a nice sweet spot for a brand-name dock. This model keeps the footprint small while still including HDMI, USB-A, Ethernet, and 100W charging support. Right now it’s $20.64, which is one of the lowest prices in the whole list. It covers the essentials with HDMI, three USB 3.0 ports, and charging support. The $24.99 price is already budget-friendly, and it’s down from $29.99. Same idea as the adjustable version, just in a silver finish and a little more compact. Includes HDMI, USB ports, and charging. The sale drops it to $33.87 from $39.99.",
