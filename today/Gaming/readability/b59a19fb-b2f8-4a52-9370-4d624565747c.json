  "text": "Hattack of the Wizard Brain Stealer sees the evil hat of a dead mage robbing other spellcasters of their magical abilities. Malakazam is long dead, but his hat still has a bone to pick with the other magic users throughout the land. To hurt them and satisfy its thirst for power, it needs to hop on top of their heads, stealing their magical abilities once it’s latched onto their brain. It always brings a part of its previous owner along with it, though, building up an array of spells from every host it has been in contact with. Using this array of unique abilities, it plans to grow strong enough to eventually take over the most skilled sorcerers in the world. This all works using the image of the brain that you see at the bottom of the screen. Each colored area relates to one of the spells you can access. These let you cause damage, protect yourself, heal, or cause other useful buffs. Each of these has an MP cost that you’ll want to keep an eye on. You can rest whenever you like to restore some of your MP, but it does waste a turn. Now, the key part is that, once you use one of these spells, you strain that area of the brain for a little while. This causes the MP cost to increase if you try to use that spell again (as well as the spells on either side of it). You can use it again at that increased cost, but this drives the cost of using it the next turn into the stratosphere. So, you need to factor rest or increased costs into your strategy each round. And, as you steal a spell from your former host each round, you also need to pick which spell you want to add to your pool of abilities for the next battle. Hattack of the Wizard Brain Stealer offers some fun routes to victory depending on what spells you keep. It’s also clever with its use of brain exhaustion making you be careful about which powers you draw upon each round, making for a short, silly, and satisfying series of magical battles. Hattack of the Wizard Brain Stealer is playable now (for free) on itch.io.
