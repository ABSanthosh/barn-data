  "text": "Hi everyone! The Forever Skies team just surprise-released a PlayStation 5 exclusive demo, and it’s available today! The demo is specially designed for our PlayStation fans so we’ve made sure it’s got a lot to offer.  Forever Skies is a first-person, sci-fi survival game where you build, fly, and customize your own mobile airship base while exploring a ruined Earth. So let’s set the scene first. When a perpetual toxic dust cloud enveloped the surface of the Earth following an ecological disaster, humanity made a last-ditch stand by relocating to makeshift towers that rose above the dust layer, relying on airships to move around. When all hope was lost, the last remnants of humanity fled into orbit. You play as a scientist from this last pocket of civilization, sent back to Earth on a crucial mission to find a cure for an illness spreading throughout the space station that houses the last of humanity. Our demo is a specially designed vertical slice of the game that provides a streamlined introduction to some of our best features. It should take you around 1.5 – 2.5 hours to finish.  So what can you expect? First you’ll crash-land back on Earth and need to hit the ground running. The details of what went wrong with the expedition before yours are scarce, so you better start piecing together what details you can. Scavenge your surroundings for supplies, use technology to unlock tools to help you collect food and water to survive, and most importantly, get your airship flight ready to take off and explore the world. Follow the trail of story objectives as you explore towers that served as radio hubs, small makeshift towns, and wind farms from humanity’s past efforts to rebuild. Learn what it takes to survive here, extracting resources from the air or fishing for dust moths to eat. Build and customize your airship to make it feel like your own and experience being a scientist as you use technology and smarts to best the hostile world you’ve returned to. This custom snippet of our story and basic game progression takes around an hour if you follow the objectives. After that, you can continue to explore the world more freely, with a few open-world objectives to guide your sightseeing. We’ve also added some great PlayStation 5 features to the demo. Thanks to The DualSense controller’s adaptive triggers, tools like the deck extractor, build tool, and scanner each feel unique when you use them. We’ve also integrated haptic feedback for these tools and for other moments like when you’re piloting your airship for example. We’ve redirected some VO prompts to play through the controller speaker and we made sure the demo supports both Performance and High Fidelity modes so you can play to match your preferences. Most notably though we’ve added a special in-game reward for those truly dedicated scientists who complete the entire demo, by finishing all the objectives, you’ll earn a free PlayStation-exclusive airship. You’ll be able to paint your airship in PlayStation-inspired hues of blue, and this skin will carry over into the full game when it launches—just be sure to keep your demo save intact on your console. That said though, we couldn’t pack everything our game has to offer into the demo. In the full game, you’ll also get to explore below the toxic dust, where an entirely new and mutant ecosystem has evolved. You’ll have access to even more tools and technology to survive and thrive, take on the threat of advanced flora and fauna that evolved in our absence, create even more advanced airships, and discover many more unique locations. But most importantly, you’ll be able to play the full game in either a single-player or online co-op with up to three friends. We know we’ve got a really big and dedicated fanbase of PlayStation players waiting for the full game, so we hope this special demo gives you a great first taste of what’s to come. We put a lot of work into it and can’t wait to hear your feedback. So, head over to PlayStation Store, download the demo, and start exploring. And if you really enjoyed the demo, please give us a wishlist so you’ll be notified when the full game releases in early 2025. Thanks so much for reading, and see you in the skies! Trending Stories",
