As with the expansions, the real question is what will be new or different about those servers.  With EverQuest now in its 26th year, and having started doing special servers almost 20 years ago at this point, the Norrath team might be the industry experts on this sort of thing… though Blizzard, guided by long time EverQuest chief Holly Longdale, is catching up… and they know their business on this front. EverQuest 26th Anniversary Poster – Available for Purchase Online While a good, old fashioned progression server is great, there isn’t an strong audience for that every year.  There needs to a 4 or 5 year respite between those to build up the nostalgia and such.  So on the off years we get experiments in special servers to see if they can come up with a magic formula that will enchant a new audience.  As such, their big reveal isn’t that a special server is coming, but what rule set they are going to try next. And we recently got producer’s letters for both games with plans, so let’s see what they are going to offer up for 2025 for EverQuest, the grand dame of the company and the franchise. This is time around we’re in for an “expanded start” server experiment. Well, what does that mean? Expanded Start. It’s been a request for some years where some players wanted to have more expansions unlocked from the start (here’s looking at you players that main Iksar and Vah Shir). With this year’s expanded start, players will have access to more player races, locations, and tons more content with oodles of loot to obtain right from the start. There is also some concern about pacing and people falling behind… though I suspect the problem is less people falling behind than people realizing that they are not up for the grind that is old school EverQuest.  It is fun for a day or a week or a month, but is it a still a viable lifestyle choice?  Anyway, they think slowing things down will help as described below. Slow Initial Unlocks. The fact is the population on every progression server declines as more and more expansions unlock. So, to keep a healthy server population for a longer period, we are extending the unlock time within some of the early expansions. We hope the slower initial progression leads to a longer, healthier progression server over the lifespan of the server. Meanwhile, what I said about grind, well they want to shake that up as well with the resource hunter concept.  I guess with the “multiple versions of crowded zones” tech they have, this could be viable, having everybody chase the hot zone. Resource Hunter. The concept behind this ruleset is to expand the experience of hot zones to a new daily method. We hope that it will not only bring the thrill of finding new special areas but also bring the community together in the hunt. The Resource Hunter ruleset of random daily bonuses should not only encourage playing in a variety of zones and exploring more of Norrath, but also make it more rewarding to roam in different zones than you might normally on a TLP. I am not a fan of encounter locking.  It was a huge problem in early EQII.  But they have data, so that is going to be a thing. Encounter Locking. While it initially had some controversy, looking at the lifespan of Oakwynd it has been seen as a net good for the server. We received enough feedback and analyzed the data, and it appears to have ultimately benefited the server enough to try it again. Finally, there is the “Legacy Characters” concept, which I am not sure I understand.  Is that where the name reservation thing enters into it? Legacy Characters. We’re big fans of this ruleset. We tried it and we liked it overall, so we’re doing it again. It will be interesting to see how it works in parallel with the Alternate Personas feature. Also, I am not a big fan of name reservations as it is just an invite for people to cyber squat on a range of names that they may never use.  But, whatever. So those are the high level concepts.  We also got a series of bullet points to cement those ideas into… bullet points I guess.  But there are also more details about what the plan is. Expanded Start Start with Ruins of Kunark, Scars of Velious, and Shadows of Luclin unlocked and level-locked to level 50. Enjoy access to a more varied level 50 experience with Iksar and Vah Shir available on launch day! Spend 24 weeks experiencing everything our first 3 expansions have to offer before the level cap is increased to 60. Planes of Power unlocks 12 weeks later, followed by additional unlocks happening at the regular cadence with a compressed level 70 range. Resource Hunter The hunt is on for daily, zone-wide bonuses! Every day at midnight Pacific, a limited number of zones in each unlocked expansion will be assigned a random bonus. Find the zones to find the bonuses and share your discovery with the community! Bonuses may include any of the following: Increased EXP Increased Loot Increased AA EXP (In level 50+ zones) Increased Coin Drops Reduced NPC Spawn Times Increased Rare NPC Spawns … and more! Name Reservations Want to make sure you get your character’s name before launch? Name reservations will once again be available via the /reservename command. The following dates indicate when you’ll be able to reserve names for the new server, and how much /played time your character needs from an existing server to be able to reserve the name: April 30: 200 days played May 7: 100 days played May 14: 40 days played May 21: 10 days played Keep in mind, characters cannot reserve their name if they have changed names in the past 30 days. Afterwards they posted an update to the unlock schedule, which added some increments in the first 24 weeks that were initially going to be 50 fi r Expanded Start Launch with Ruins of Kunark to Shadows of Luclin unlocked and level locked to 50 Increase level lock to 51 after 8 weeks Increase level lock to 55 after 8 weeks Increase level lock to 60 after 8 weeks Unlock Planes of Power after 12 weeks New expansions unlock automatically every 8/12 weeks So that is the plan for this year’s special server.  We shall see if it sticks… and how chaotic the resource hunter aspect becomes.  And all of this will kick of for real with the server launch at 12:00 Pacific time (19:00 UTC) on May 28, 2025!
