  "text": "As I noted in Friday’s post, this past weekend saw everything reset again in Stars Reach as new features were set to be introduced.  In particular, homesteads were on the agenda. Stars Reach We are starting to get to what can be the trying bit of this stage of testing, the starting over aspect when the game is starting to get enough features to play with that getting to them requires some effort. So the past few posts were set in the same set of testing sessions without a wipe in between, allowing me to build on past sessions.  The downside is having to go do all that again.  The upside is getting to use what you learned so it should take nearly as long to get there. Into that mix goes all the changes and whatever benefits and issues come with them.  No new feature is without flaw.  To cover all of this, the test session on Saturday was extended to be three hours.  Could I go through my mental order of operations and set myself up to test the new stuff in that time? Short answer: No. I got close though.  I certainly got further than I did in the last few two hour sessions.  Also, I didn’t get a full three hours.  There were server issues that delayed the start… always happens when you have a live studio audience waiting on you… and then I had to cut out a little early for real life.  But in between I moved along. First up, I needed the grav mesh because I have decided that the grav mesh means life.  It is a way to avoid and evade hostile mobs as well as a method for moving over obstructing terrain. That meant doing some surveying.  But that is easy enough.  I can do that.  And that would help me with some other items and the survey and ranger tree had been merged since last time around. Just have to unlock the grav mesh recipe At ten points per survey node, I just needed 20 to get there.  Easy peasy, and off I went. They are easy to find at night I got those done, and a few more, because I was going to need more points anyway, then set about getting the resources for the grav mesh. I had started grabbing salt with the harvester, but then spotted some blue on a nearby hill, right next to the temperate world spawn point, which turned out to be sapphire.  I dug all of that out of the ground.  Then I needed a tier 3 metal. Tier 3 metals list Those are all available on planet, though I have had bad luck finding them.  I did find some uranium, but that is tier 4. Hey, uranium just here for the taking… I am sure there is no long term health issue after walking around on a bunch of surface uranium sitting there in the world. The easiest way to get the metal I needed was to go back to the starting camp and take the portal into space.  There was, however, a problem in space. Space, now full of lava blisters As part of the update, the team had given ballhogs and ballhives, two of the aggressive flying mobs, elemental damage.  They would now hit with freezing or heat attacks.  The former lock you in place, while the later… sets fire to things. Yup… ballhogs have been here… Their thermal attacks also heat things.  This gets worse when somebody decides to fight them with the heat option on the ranger tool.  A lot of asteroid space wasn’t very usable.  But there was still some corners where I could find some of the right metals.  There is also now a prospecting tool that helps you find the minerals you are looking for… if you can figure out how to use it.  That took a bit, but eventually I got it. Something is there I had to select what I was looking for in one mode, then go back to the harvesting mode and look for the mineral from there.  Like any process, once you get used to it, it is normal.  But that is a was from it being intuitive.  That wasn’t the only thing I had to learn.  There were a pile of changes, including to the keyboard layout itself. The December version The big change was probably the “G” key, which had been used to equip your selected tool.  That is now done but hitting the number associated with the slot the tool is in.  I do wonder how long the hot bar is going to remain a mere 4 digits in size. Also, in looking at that, I now realize I have never once used or made the grapple. But who needs the grapple when you have the grav mesh?  Am I right? Sure, I could grapple up there I guess… but why not fly? I got my materials, and bit more for later, then went back to the temperate planet, where I had started out, and built my grav mesh.  Then I went and got the rest of the survey nodes because I could and because I was going to need the points for other things in that tree. It also tells everybody in the test you did it… though Raph no longer personally congratulates you One of the things was the unlock for civil engineering, which got me the recipe for the Instaformer, covered in a previous post.  The cost of civil engineering had also been knocked down from 500 to 200 points, so I had some points left for other things. Peeking over the edge of the world… I’ve been down there before… I had what I needed to build the Instaformer too.  Now I just needed blocks to so I could build with it and earn points in the civil engineering tree, and blocks needed raw materials and I knew where to find those so I wrapped up my session for the day harvest that, dumping tailings, and being attacked by extremely aggressive deer. And then I had to go, so the Saturday test was over for me with not a thing yet built. But there were already further play tests on the schedule, including one on Monday night.  I was able to get on for that one and picked up immediately again with materials.  There was, however, a hiccup that was broadcast to us. I have bad/good news for you. Over the weekend, we were fixing the login issues we had on Saturday morning. In the process of doing that, we accidentally reset the simulation servers. What does that mean? Cons All the digging/melting/etc that was done on Saturday is reset back to original state. All Instaformer blocks and Paver work has been removed from the world. Pros All the resources that were mined are back in the world, so you can mine them again. Everything that was in your player record (all your inventory and items) are just fine…you’ll still have them when you join the game again. All building tiles will still be in place. Your homesteads are still in place. We’ve added saving process for the simulation assets so that going forward, this should not happen again. We’re sorry for the hiccup, but…well..at least the resources are restored, right? Having build nothing so far, that sounded all fine and dandy to me.  When I logged in on Monday night I went immediately back to the sapphire vein I had previously mined out… and mined it out again.  Then I saw what looked to be a ruby vein in the distance. Ruby veins exposed Once again, grav mesh was there to solve my problem.  I flew myself up to a perch on the face of that mountain and bumped into Carneros, one of the Playable Worlds team. Going out on a ledge I doubt doubt impressed him by killing myself almost immediately by dumping my tailings into an enclosed space and crushing myself with them.  Always glad to demonstrate that they have chosen the best players to test their product. The team was out playing with us for sure though.  When I was on voice coms I could hear Raph and a few others chatting about an area they were building up on the jungle planet.  I was not there yet.  I had civil engineering to boost still.  So I took all those materials I had gathered during the first test, made blocks… again, repeated crafting is a bit of a chore… then built a platform and some walls to get myself to the point where I could, once again, unlock the fabricator, the tool with which you can place building parts, along with the basic building parts kit… walls, doors, windows, and such. And, on unlocking that I found I needed some wood for those pieces, so I needed to make the Xyloslicer, which needed more material, which meant another trip to space to get that along with some other supplies, after which I was able to build it and cut down some trees… or consume some trees, since it puts a blue cylinder around the tree as it digests it. Processing a tree like a modern cat person does Having done that, collected some wood, along with crafting some of the building pieces, I went and put down a camp, turned into a homestead… which means it won’t go away… and then got out the fabricator to lay down some floor pieces. Piece of cake, right I managed to get three linked up and aligned correctly before the whole thing became so finicky that I couldn’t snap a piece in the right location to save my life.  I have fiddled with quite a few building UIs at this point, including Valheim, Conan Exiles, and Enshrouded this year, and this was not working for me. Immediately frustrated by the whole thing, I went off to see what other people had been up to.  The talk on voice coms had been very focused on what people were building and how to achieve a specific idea and the problems of ending up with lava in ones basement. On the temperate world, I saw somebody with three adjacent homesteads working on something big. A foundation for something big Over on the desert world I found a couple sites under development, including this one up in one corner of the world. The blue wall of the edge of the world… But it was the jungle world where builders seemed to be congregating to try and form some sort of combined settlement. The jungle planet homestead plots There was a lot going on there, including one plot that was dedicated to a grove of trees, which you can plant if you get your botany skill up… though that is a very slow climb. In the midst of all of that was probably the most talked about item, the fountain. The fountain and some foundations behind It was a nice fountain.  While it did not spout, it bubbled and flowed nicely. I will admit, I was a bit relieved on arriving the on the jungle planet to find that people were still mostly working on foundations… something I hadn’t done, so maybe a clue for me… and that I wasn’t greeted by somebody’s fully formed recreation of Neuschwanstein.  Maybe I am not as hopelessly behind on things as I might have thought. At about that point the Monday night play test wrapped up and Carneros and I went off to blow up an Astrahus in the Curse region of New Eden.  We’re both on that kill mail. Meanwhile, the test went well enough.  No crashes at my end.  It is still in a pre-alpha state, which means there is a lot of work left to be done to sort things out, and then polish to be applied on top of that.  Nothing at this point is set in stone and I would be surprised is the player experience a year from now was anything like this. That said, things are progressing with each test.  We even got some nice little additions including a meter that displays how full the hopper is on your extractor and a timer in the UI to show you how long your camp has before it expires.  Small things, but useful.

id=\"caption-attachment-125665\"\u003eThe fountain and some foundations behind\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a nice fountain.  While it did not spout, it bubbled and flowed nicely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will admit, I was a bit relieved on arriving the on the jungle planet to find that people were still mostly working on foundations… something I hadn’t done, so maybe a clue for me… and that I wasn’t greeted by somebody’s fully formed recreation of Neuschwanstein.  Maybe I am not as hopelessly behind on things as I might have thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt about that point the Monday night play test wrapped up and Carneros and I went off to blow up \u003ca href=\"https://zkillboard.com/kill/123139458/\"\u003ean Astrahus in the Curse region\u003c/a\u003e of New Eden.  We’re both on that kill mail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the test went well enough.  No crashes at my end.  It is still in a pre-alpha state, which means there is a lot of work left to be done to sort things out, and then polish to be applied on top of that.  Nothing at this point is set in stone and I would be surprised is the player experience a year from now was anything like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, things are progressing with each test.  We even got some nice little additions including a meter that displays how full the hopper is on your extractor and a timer in the UI to show you how long your camp has before it expires.  Small things, but useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePast play test
