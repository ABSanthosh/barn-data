Right now the 43\" Samsung Odyssey Neo G7 4K Mini-LED QLED gaming monitor is available for only $399.99 after a massive $500 discount. This model, the CG700N, seems to be identical to the CG702N model that's currently on sale at Amazon for $570... except that you're paying $170 less. This is without a doubt one of the best monitors you'll find for $400 or under.43\" Samsung Odyssey Neo G7 4K Mini-LED Gaming MonitorSamsung Odyssey Neo G7 43\" 4K (3840x2160) 1ms 144Hz Quantum Dot Mini-LED Gaming MonitorThe 43\" Samsung Neo G7 gaming monitor features a native 4K (3840x2160) resolution with a pixel density of 137ppi, which is sharp for a PC display and lends well to both gaming and general workstation tasks. The 16:9 aspect ratio is more useful than the ultra-wide or super ultra-wide monitors - especially outside of gaming - since you get additional vertical real estate. Note that because a 4K monitor has significantly more pixels than QHD or even WQHD, you'll need a proper GPU to run games at a playable framerate. I'd suggest at least a GeForce RTX 3080 or 4070 or Radeon RX 7800 XT.The Samsung Neo-series gaming monitors combine quantum dot (QLED) technology with mini LEDs. The 43\" Neo G7 has 360 independently dimming zones that produce great black levels and high contrast ratio. You'd need to move up to an OLED panel to get anything better, and that's more expensive and comes with its own set of disadvantages. The Neo G7 is also HDR600 certified, which means it has wide color gamut and can achieve a peak brightness of 600nits, much brighter than any OLED monitor. Mini-LED monitors also aren't prone to burn-in issues.The Neo G7 has plenty of other gaming-centric features like a fast 1ms GtG response time, a high 144Hz refresh rate, and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro certification (which means it's also G-Sync compatible). It has both HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4 ports so you can also hook up your PlayStation 5 (or your new PS5 Pro) or Xbox Series X for 4K console gaming at 120fps. Note that this monitor also comes with smart TV functionality so you can use it like a regular 43\" TV.If you're looking for a good deal, you simply won't find anything better in this category. However, if your budget is boundless, check out all of the best 4K gaming monitors. If a 4K monitor is not what you're looking for, we've also picked out the best gaming monitors for every type of gamer.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
