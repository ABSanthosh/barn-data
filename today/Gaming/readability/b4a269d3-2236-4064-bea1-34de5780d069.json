  "text": "Lightbringer Expansion introduces six new characters, perks, abilities, and Offerings. Image credit: 99 Level Games / Behaviour Interactive A new expansion for the Dead by Daylight: The Board Game is on the way. The Lightbringer Expansion - slated to release sometime in Q3/autumn this year - introduces three new Killers and four new Survivors, as well as new perks and \"horrifying abilities\". Newscast: Xbox currently has more first-party games coming to PlayStation 5 this year than Sony Xbox currently has more first-party games coming to PlayStation 5 this year than Sony.Watch on YouTube Lightbringer also introduces Offerings, which \"add a new setup to adjust the difficulty of the game to frightening proportions!\", although the developer 99 Level Games stopped short of giving us the details. Image credit: 99 Level Games / Behaviour Interactive The Gatekeeper expansion is also now available. This one includes five new Survivors with unique perks and five new Killers with 10 \"hauntingly-detailed miniature figurines\" to customise your experience. As for the video game itself? Most recently, developer Behaviour Interactive confirmed Pinhead - and his Hellraiser Chapter DLC - would be yanked from sale on 4th April. As explained in Behaviour's announcement earlier this month, he's only retreating from digital storefronts - existing owners can continue playing with him after 4th April, but no new purchases of the Hellraiser Chapter DLC would be possible. Behaviour didn't explain why the DLC was being removed from sale, but as Matt posited at the time, the answer is almost certainly licensing-related.",
