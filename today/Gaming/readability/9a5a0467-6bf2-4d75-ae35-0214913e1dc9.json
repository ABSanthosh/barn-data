Crossing the open fields, headed towards somebody’s place You show up in a settlement, you go to the mead hall at the center of the place, you go speak with the thane who is in charge of the area, and you go do his dirty work.  And some of the locals have serious issues to deal with. What, again? And, sometimes the issues are not so serious. Look, they’ve copied WoW’s outhouse quests! Sometimes the thane is a firebrand, sometimes they’re a morose old fart on the far side of their best years, and sometimes it is a kid who inherited the position and his mother is standing by and you have to clear everything through her.  There is a lot of “go talk to the person standing next to me” sorts of things and proving yourself to whoever is running the show.  But eventually they warm to you. No mere Thained praise But the mead hall, that is the center of life in every Rohan settlement  They all have one and they vary only slightly in design or size, and at the head of each at a big table you will find the local thane. The manic depressive thane of Middlemead I started off in The Wold, where the first settlement needed to be evacuated to the second I ran into.  That is another common theme, that they all know that trouble is on the way. After making things right there… or at least delaying the White Hand orcs… it was on to the The East Wall, where I found no mead halls, just an outpost and a lot more orcs.  After that it was on to the Norcrofts and some more mead halls and more thanes and more of the same sorts of things… which means orcs, along with a bunch of farms. On arriving on the Sutcrofts there was a bit of a change up.  First was the town of Snowbourn which, despite the name, is not in the snow.  I mean, Rohan is all fields and horses right, where would you find snow? Oh yeah, in Wildermore, because every expansion is contractually required to have some sort of snow experience or because one of the designers just really likes snow or something.  We’ll see if that carries forward, but there were two snow zones in Eriador, snowy areas in Eregion outside Moria, snow in Dunland, and now snow in Rohan. I went to Wildermore for a bit.  I even stopped in and saw Nona, speaking of Dunland and call backs. Hey Nona, long road from Enedwaith wasn’t it? I can’t recall why Nona was in a frozen cave in the hills of Wildermore, or why there was a quest to go speak to her.  But Horn, who was up there, shows up again later. Meanwhile, Snowbourn has actual stone walls rather than another set of wooden palisades, making it stand out so far in Rohan.   It also has a strange symbiotic relationship with Hytbold, another settlement there in the Sutcrofts, one which was burned… well, not down, because everything is literally still standing.  Say rather than it was severely singed or cooked in the blackened Cajun style. Anyway, you have to help rebuild the place… or scrape off the black char or whatever… by getting a quest there that sends you to Snowbourn to do five daily quests, each of which grants you ten tokens, which you then take back to the two blokes standing around in the middle of the charred state of Hytbold to turn in either to help refinish part of the town… 1 token per bit, but there are a lot of bits… or which you can barter for a reputation boost with one of four East Rohan factions. The quests were fine.  You can do the same five every day and once you know the routine, like standing in a field with wheat taller than you sniping warg riders as they spawn, you can knock them out pretty fast. I just tab target and shoot… I can’t see them really otherwise I had restored the stable master and mead hall… you can’t get anything down until the mead hall is back and in operation and without the stable master you have to walk between the two places… I tended to focus on getting kindred rep with the Sutcrofts residents.  Once I had that I started trying to just spend the tokens to rebuild the place, but then found you need to be kindred level faction with four groups to finish the whole settlement. Meanwhile, while the daily quests were easy and decent xp, the mobs in the instanced events do not drop anything.  That might seem like a blessing for the inventory strapped, but as somebody as dedicated as I to doing all of their daily task quota… and mine is up to 15… every single day, not getting those drops for tasks started to pinch. I keep up on the dailies, if only to get the two remaining factions up to kindred, but I have moved on.  That was apparently some Riders of Rohan end game stuff or something.  But I am riding through a world where that was more than a decade in the past and eventually I found somebody to send me along to Kingstead and Medusled where, on arriving and turning in the quest that sent me there, I hit level 86. Hitting 86 was important in a legendary item way that I will likely get to in another post. Anyway, I pulled up at night before the biggest mead hall of them all, Theoden’s residence, where he too awaited at the far end in his seat, as even the lowliest thane had done so far. The Mead House Regional HQ It was night when I approached the door and Hama, every slack in his duties, let me in without making me set aside either bow or sword.  Once inside I was treated to a dinner theater level production… people were literally eating, and the prime rib looked pretty good… of the scene where Gandalf reignites Theoden’s spirits and frees him from the clutches of Grima Wormtongue. Then, to seal the deal, Gandalf persuades Theoden to go out into the daylight and my thought was this might end badly as it was the middle of the night and it frankly looked like rain was coming, with some storm clouds in the distance.  (The distant lightning weather effects are very good.) But when we went out it was daylight and Theoden was further revived. We were in there a long time… or it was magic… or instancing Then we go through the whole follow on routine except that it is I, Tistann, who goes forth to fetch the sword of Theoden and other items that Wormtongue had hidden away.  I can only say that I was ill treated by Tolkien in his refusal to mention me by name in the book! Theoden announced he was off to war and all that, and I got to stand around while he and the headlining cast formed up to ride to their destiny. Theoden and not so many riders mustered But before he go there, he assigned the task of taking care of business while he was away to Eowyn, and who does he leave as her assistant and general dogsbody?  Why, Tistann… that’s me! Left in the rear with the gear Also, what friends?  I am a sullen, heavily armed loaner wandering Middle-earth performing menial tasks and completing murder for hire contracts. Anyway, look at that.  Theoden knows my freaking name!  This isn’t just Gandalf doing his Kreskin routine, but a bereaved old man with obvious memory issues who has not only latched on to my name but has has assigned me a position of responsibility in helping Eowyn collect and shepherd the good folk of Rohan… at least those besides the ones riding off to war…. to safety. You would think with that kind of endorsement I would be at least worthy of an Ally of The Eorlingas title or something.  But, no.  On the rep chart the people of West Rohan are, at best, neutral on me.  Sometimes it isn’t even who you know. Meanwhile, Eowyn’s reaction the moment Theoden and crew were out of sight… was not encouraging. I am not sure how to even take that Anyway, now I have to help clean up yet again.  At least once we get done in the mean hall.",

href=\"https://lotro-wiki.com/wiki/The_Wold\"\u003eThe Wold\u003c/a\u003e, where the first settlement needed to be evacuated to the second I ran into.  That is another common theme, that they all know that trouble is on the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter making things right there… or at least delaying the White Hand orcs… it was on to the \u003ca href=\"https://lotro-wiki.com/wiki/The_East_Wall\"\u003eThe East Wall\u003c/a\u003e, where I found no mead halls, just an outpost and a lot more orcs.  After that it was on to the \u003ca href=\"https://lotro-wiki.com/wiki/Norcrofts\"\u003eNorcrofts\u003c/a\u003e and some more mead halls and more thanes and more of the same sorts of things… which means orcs, along with a bunch of

of snow experience or because one of the designers just really likes snow or something.  We’ll see if that carries forward, but there were two snow zones in Eriador, snowy areas in Eregion outside Moria, snow in Dunland, and now snow in Rohan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to Wildermore for a bit.  I even stopped in and saw Nona, speaking of Dunland and call backs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv

or why there was a quest to go speak to her.  But Horn, who was up there, shows up again later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Snowbourn has actual stone walls rather than another set of wooden palisades, making it stand out so far in Rohan.   It also has a strange symbiotic relationship with Hytbold, another settlement there in the Sutcrofts, one which was burned… well, not down, because everything is literally still standing.  Say rather than it was severely singed or cooked in the blackened Cajun style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, you have to help rebuild the place… or scrape off the black char or whatever… by getting a quest there that sends you to Snowbourn to do five daily quests, each of which grants you ten tokens, which you then take back to the two blokes standing around in the middle of the charred state of Hytbold to turn in either to help refinish part of the town… 1 token per bit, but there are a lot of bits… or which you can barter for a reputation boost with one of four East Rohan factions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quests were fine.  You can do the same five every day and once you know the routine, like standing in a field

settlement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, while the daily quests were easy and decent xp, the mobs in the instanced events do not drop anything.  That might seem like a blessing for the

pinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep up on the dailies, if only to get the two remaining factions up to kindred, but I have moved on.  That was apparently some \u003cem\u003eRiders of
