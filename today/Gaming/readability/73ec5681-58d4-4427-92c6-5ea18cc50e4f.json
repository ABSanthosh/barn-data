Roblox Beaks is a new, relaxing game where you capture birds using a tranquilizer gun and then sell them for profit. No Roblox birds get harmed in this game, so don’t worry. With that said, there is a lot to know about Beaks, which is why we decided to create this Ultimate Beginner’s Guide to Roblox Beaks. Table of contentsHow to play Roblox BeaksHow guns work in Roblox BeaksDarts in Roblox BeaksThermal Vision Goggles and Night Vision Goggles in Roblox BeaksWhat does the Wishing Well do in Roblox Beaks?Roblox Beaks Tips and TricksClimb high and shoot lowWhat to buy in Roblox Beaks?Secret leveling method in Roblox Beaks How to play Roblox Beaks Screenshot by The Escapist In Roblox Beaks, you take out your trusty rifle, aim at birds flying in the sky, and shoot them with tranquilizers (don’t worry, you don’t kill them). Each time you capture a bird, you gain some XP, and when you reach higher levels, you can buy new guns and equipment. The birds you capture get added to your inventory, and you can sell them for profit at the Bird Bazaar. Each bird can also have a mutation, and these tend to sell for more. You can hunt birds in four different zones, and each one has its own bestiary. The birds you capture can range from common to mythical. Naturally, the rarer the bird, the more you can sell it for. That’s the general gameplay loop. Capture birds – sell them – buy a better gun – capture more birds. How guns work in Roblox Beaks Screenshot by The Escapist The type of gun you have in Roblox Beaks can make a huge difference. Different guns can fire faster, further, and do more damage when capturing birds. In general, you should always go for the strongest gun in the game, but there are a few exceptions to this rule. Some guns, like the Lakeborne Shotgun, have the shortest firing distance, but shoot two bullets. This is pretty much useless when taking out birds (it will probably get a buff one day), especially because of its short firing distance. In general, you should prioritize the following stats: Distance \u003e Strength \u003e Speed \u003e Fire Rate \u003e Handling For a list of the best guns in Roblox Beaks, check out our Complete Roblox Beaks Guns Tier List. Darts in Roblox Beaks Screenshot by The Escapist Similar to bait in Roblox Fisch, you can use special darts in Roblox Beaks. You have an infinite supply of regular darts, but you can also buy special darts from the Dartsmith. Unfortunately, there isn’t much point in using these special darts, and here are the reasons why: Special Darts are consumable You don’t get to pick which darts you get You only get a few darts (about 5 of them) Special Darts don’t actually do that much more damage You can miss a shot and still lose the Dart Equipping different darts is slow and clunky (especially if you see a rare bird and want to quickly change darts) but the most important reason of all is that Special Darts are very expensive Even though $200 might not sound like much, most birds in the game sell for around 50 – 100, so it really doesn’t seem like it’s worth it. Only after you obtain the best gun in the game, and have nothing better to spend money on do we recommend you start getting darts. It’s always better to save money for the next gun than to spend it on Darts. Thermal Vision Goggles and Night Vision Goggles in Roblox Beaks Screenshot by The Escapist Ever found a rare bird, started shooting at it, and it flew into a tree and disappeared out of existence? If this happened to you, then maybe you need a set of Goggles. You can buy the Night Vision Goggles ($7,500) or the Thermal Vision Goggles ($10,000) at Silverstone Camp. In essence, they both do the same thing – show you where the birds are with a nice glow. However, one major difference between the two is that the Thermal Vision Goggles work during the day as well. The Night Vision Goggles do have a longer range, but if you can only afford one, we definitely recommend you go with Thermal. What does the Wishing Well do in Roblox Beaks? Screenshot by The Escapist On your way to Mountain Beaks, you may have come across a magical-looking well and are wondering what it actually does. The Wishing Well is Beak’s answer to Fisch’s appraisal system. You can pay a small fee (it depends on the bird you’re holding) to change one of your bird’s stats and mutation. This doesn’t always work, and it can often backfire, costing you more than it’s worth. In short, this is a game of chance, and we don’t really recommend doing it unless you’ve got money to burn or are after very specific bird mutations. How to set up a new spawn point in Roblox Beaks Screenshot by The Escapist Sometimes you’ll need to walk a good while in Roblox Beaks. Unfortunately, movement is very slow, and traveling can be annoying. You can make this easier by setting a new spawn point. Find a Camper NPC, talk to them, and ask if you can stay. It costs only $100 to set a news spawn point. This is a great method for moving fast. In fact, you can relog into the game to fast travel between locations by using this (Shhh! You didn’t hear it from us). Roblox Beaks Tips and Tricks Below we’ll give you a few tips that really helped us out with Roblox Beaks: Climb high and shoot low It almost feels mandatory to stay on the ground and fire birds in the air, but does it really need to be that way? Of course not! You can climb up a tall hill and shoot birds below you. It’s actually a lot easier than the regular method. So give it a try: climb high, aim low, and… roll in… dough(?). We’ll let ourselves out. What to buy in Roblox Beaks? Screenshot by The Escapist The only thing we believe is worth buying, if you’re planning to play Beaks actively, is the Double XP gamepass for 399 Robux. This doubles all your XP gain. You’ll still need to earn all that money, but at least leveling up will be a lot easier. Secret leveling method in Roblox Beaks For the most part, there really isn’t a super easy way to level up – just capture a lot of birds. The best place to do this now is Quill Lake. The Problem is: other players. When a bird spawns, it’s always a race between all players who can shoot it first, and this can be quite annoying. Thankfully, there is an easy fix for this. Host your own private server. The best thing about this? It’s completely free! Just host your own server and enjoy capturing birds all by your lonesome. You won’t be chatting up other players, but you also won’t have to compete for that Great Egret at Quill Lake. The devs will likely start charging a small fee for hosting servers in the future, so we advise you to take advantage of this now. That’s all there is to it. Have fun capturing birds.

You didn’t hear it from us).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    \u003ch2 id=\"h-roblox-beaks-tips-and-tricks\" data-injectable=\"false\"\u003eRoblox Beaks Tips and Tricks\u003c/h2\u003e    \u003cp data-characters=\"82\" data-current-count=\"82\" data-injectable=\"false\"\u003eBelow we’ll give you a few tips that really helped us out with Roblox Beaks:\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"h-climb-high-and-shoot-low\" data-injectable=\"false\"\u003eClimb high and shoot low\u003c/h3\u003e    \u003cp data-characters=\"349\" data-current-count=\"431\" data-injectable=\"true\"\u003eIt almost feels mandatory to stay on the ground and fire birds in the air, but does it really need to be that way? Of course not! You can \u003cstrong\u003eclimb up a tall hill and shoot birds below you\u003c/strong\u003e. It’s actually a lot easier than the regular method. So give it a try: climb high, aim low, and… roll in… dough(?). We’ll let ourselves out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    \u003ch3 id=\"h-what-to-buy-in-roblox-beaks\" data-injectable=\"false\"\u003eWhat to buy in Roblox Beaks?\u003c/h3\u003e    \u003cfigure data-current-count=\"300\" data-injectable=\"false\"\u003e\u003cimg data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.escapistmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Double-XP-Beaks.jpg?w=1024\u0026amp;resize=1200%2C675\" alt=\"The shop in Roblox Beaks\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eScreenshot by The Escapist\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e    \u003cp data-characters=\"259\" data-current-count=\"559\" data-injectable=\"true\"\u003eThe only thing we believe is worth buying, if you’re planning to play Beaks actively, is the \u003cstrong\u003eDouble XP gamepass for 399 Robux\u003c/strong\u003e. This doubles all your XP gain. You’ll still need to earn all that money, but at least leveling up will be a lot easier. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    \u003ch3 id=\"h-secret-leveling-method-in-roblox-beaks\" data-injectable=\"false\"\u003eSecret leveling method in Roblox Beaks\u003c/h3\u003e    \u003cp data-characters=\"349\" data-current-count=\"349\" data-injectable=\"false\"\u003eFor the most part, there really isn’t a super easy way to level up – just capture a lot of birds. The best place to do this now is Quill Lake. \u003cstrong\u003eThe Problem is: other players\u003c/strong\u003e. When a bird spawns, it’s always a \u003cstrong\u003erace between all players who can shoot it first\u003c/strong\u003e, and this can be quite annoying. Thankfully, there is an easy fix for this.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp data-characters=\"281\" data-current-count=\"630\" data-injectable=\"true\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHost your own private server. The best thing about this? It’s completely free! \u003c/strong\u003eJust host your own server and enjoy capturing birds all by your lonesome. You won’t be chatting up other players, but you also won’t have to compete for that Great Egret at Quill Lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    \u003cp data-characters=\"131\" data-current-count=\"131\" data-injectable=\"false\"\u003eThe devs will likely start charging a small fee for hosting servers in the future, so we advise you to take advantage of this now. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp data-characters=\"153\" data-current-count=\"284\" data-injectable=\"false\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat’s all there is to it.
