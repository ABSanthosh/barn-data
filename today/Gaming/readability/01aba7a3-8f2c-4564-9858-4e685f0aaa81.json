Flour Sand is a rare instance where you almost have to team up with others or get very lucky, though there are, occasionally, a few safer areas to grab what you need.Below, we explain where to find Flour Sand in Dune: Awakening and how to get it safely.Dune: Awakening Flour Sand locationsImage: Funcom via PolygonFlour Sand seems to only show up in the Vermillius Gap region, both east and west, and you’ll spot it from a ways off. White dust clouds indicate areas where you can collect Flour Sand, though the specific locations change each week after the Coriolis Storm sweeps through.The catch is that they’re almost always located in or near drum sand, patches of sand that resonates when you walk or ride across it and summons the sandworm. Sometimes, you’ll get lucky and find a patch of Flour Sand on the northern or southern edge of Vermillius Gap, where there isn’t any drum sand. In general, though, if the Flour Sand is on a patch of red sand, you can guarantee the sandworm will show up.In some very lucky scenarios, you’ll have flour sand spawn in areas where the worm can’t go. Those spawns aren’t guaranteed, but it’s worth looking around the edges of rock formations just in case one showed up.How to get Flour Sand in Dune: AwakeningImage: Funcom via PolygonThe easiest way to get Flour Sand is to use the compactor tool — unlocked after you complete the second Trial of Aql — and work together with others. The Static Compactor forms clumps of sand and spice, which makes gathering faster and more efficient. The ideal situation is that one or more people lure the worm away with thumpers while the Flour Sand gatherer gets to work.If you’re playing solo, there are still a few methods you can try, though make sure you only take as much as is necessary in case the worm eats you. Store a backup vehicle in the backup tool, and leave that at your base as well.Take a bike or other fast vehicle, and equip a booster on itPark it near the edge of the Flour Sand, and point it toward rocks or safetyGather the sand, assuming the worm hasn’t started breaching before you get thereOnce the worm appears, get back on your back and boost to safetyThe extra speed should be enough to get you away, though there’s still a chance the worm might catch up. Some players have reported being able to use the Bene Gesserit’s dash skill — learned natively or through a skill trainer — to get to safety, though that won’t work if the Flour Sand location isn’t close to safety.If you’re just landing on Arrakis for the first time, check out our 19 essential Dune Awakening beginner’s tips to help you get started.
