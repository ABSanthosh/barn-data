It's great--the problem, however, is that for a long while, you only have access to one HP Tank.As you traverse through the second main area of the game, which tasks you with reaching the top of the Sky-high Tree, you can come across an additional HP Tank. This, however, can be easily missed if you're rushing through things. If you're wondering how to get a second HP tank in Shadow Labyrinth, make sure to read the steps below promptly so you don't have to waste time backtracking later on.How to get a second HP Tank in Shadow LabyrinthThe location of the second HP tank in Shadow Labyrinth is in the forest area as you're making your way through the Great Tree (also referred to as Sky-High Tree). We have a dedicated guide with a Great Tree walkthrough in case you need some guidance, as it's easy to get lost.Your point of reference is in the Sky-high Tree Front area. As you progress through the level, you'll eventually come across a long path found in the western corner. From here, you'll reach the top and access a different region that culminates in a big boss encounter. But first, there's another boss fight to contend with. You can find the second HP Tank in Shadow Labyrinth after defeating Duke Sirius.From the checkpoint right at the center of the area, all you have to do is keep following the path to the right. Again, there's a boss fight at the other end, so if you don't have enough charges to transform into your GAIA form, I recommend taking the time to defeat the enemies in between and consume them for energy.Then, it's time to fight. Duke Sirius has three main attacks: As a bird, they can leap and slam the ground, so they'll try to gap the distance with you often. Then, they will flip their wings to create small whirlwinds, which can appear individually or in pairs. Lastly, Duke can also spit fire, and the attack usually covers both sides of the ground around them.Take Duke Sirius seriously, as the bird packs a punch.Here's the strategy that worked best for me: As Duke Sirius is flying down to the arena, start attacking. They always do an introductory animation, and you can get quite a few hits in while it happens. Remember to use your newly acquired attack combo--basic attack, basic attack, strong attack--to make the most of it. Then, prepare to dodge around as Duke tries to reciprocate that damage.When the whirlwinds start, use the walls on either side of the arena to gain some height, as you can attach to them. In some instances, Duke kept spawning whirlwinds. If this happens to you, just wait for an opening and make a run for it. Once you've done enough damage--up until about halfway through Duke's health bar--morph into GAIA and spam the attack button. You'll likely take down the remaining half with GAIA alone.Congratulations on acquiring a second HP Tank.Once you've defeated Duke Sirius, you'll get access to a long vine to the right of the arena. You can use this to get on top of the structure and follow the path all the way left to get to the area above. Before you do this, however, make sure to jump down below and grab the second HP Tank. If you need a visual reference, it also appears as a red question mark on the map.The reason why it can be easy to miss is that the marker, as well as the icon for the item itself, is similar to other collectibles that don't have much use. If you've been ignoring them thus far, make sure to do a quick stop for this one. Alternatively, if you're already ahead, teleport or backtrack to where you fought Duke Sirius and grab it. Doing so will automatically replenish your existing HP Tank, too, so you can continue trekking even if you barely made it out of the fight alive.
