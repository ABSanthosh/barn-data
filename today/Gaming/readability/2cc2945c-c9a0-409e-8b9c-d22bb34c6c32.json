We’ve already taken a look at Breath of the Wild, but I spent the weekend revisiting the stunning sequel I reviewed back in 2023. And not only does The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom still hold up as a game I can’t wait to lose a few dozen more hours in, the updates and additions made to the Switch 2 Edition make it feel like this is the way it was always meant to be played.Before we dive to the depths below, lets look back at what I said about Tears of the Kingdom in my initial review: That’s just as true today as it was then, and I wouldn’t second guess the 10 I slapped on it in 2023 for a second. Tears of the Kingdom may not have been the completely table-flipping revelation its predecessor was, but the way it expanded both that formula and the world was truly staggering. There’s a ridiculous amount of stuff here, and almost none of it is less than amazing. But what about the changes in the Switch 2 Edition specifically?HDR is an absolute game changer in the DepthsPerhaps the most jaw-dropping thing that is part of this update is the Switch 2’s ability to take advantage of HDR displays. The increased framerate and resolution are nice enough on their own, but exploring the dark of the Depths with the benefit of HDR is, forgive the pun, a night-and-day difference. Uncharted areas are still pitch black until illuminated, so it’s not like exploration there has been made entirely trivial, but areas with low light are suddenly so much clearer than they used to be. It takes out some of the frustration of stumbling around in the dark without removing the tension. Tom's Top 10 Zelda GamesHere is my personal top 10 Zelda games in order.Tears of the Kingdom doesn’t lag anywhere anymoreAlongside those visual improvements comes improved performance. Tears of the Kingdom was never terrible in this regard, but it did slow down or start to hitch in busy moments from time to time on Switch, and that’s completely gone on Switch 2. Similarly, diving from the sky straight into the Depths could occasionally pause for a quick second to let the world load, but I never once saw that happen on Switch 2. Building is finally buttery smooth as well, as using your Zonai abilities was another one of the moments you could potentially see things start to chug. Once again, that’s all slick and clean here. These aren’t the most monumental of improvements for an update upgrade that does cost money (if you don’t have the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pass), but they make Tears of the Kingdom feel like it has finally reached its final form – and they are helpful enough that I am seriously considering playing a lot more of this game than I initially thought I would have when I decided to revisit it. Load times are super fast nowSpeaking of performance, a special shoutout should go to the load times specifically. They are now ridiculously fast. The loading screen has always had this little animation where your icon blips out on the map, which then scrolls over to your new location, and then you finally blip back in. The Switch 2 Edition load times are so fast you barely even have time to watch the icon vanish before you are back into the action. It rocks.The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Switch 2 Edition ScreenshotsIt shares a lot of its biggest updates with Breath of the WildBoth Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom were able to benefit from the Switch 2’s beefed-up hardware to make these technical upgrades, but the two games also share a lot of new integration with the Nintendo phone app. The addition of audio logs that you can find at certain locations and listen to on your phone is a neat touch, as is being able to store and share items in a way that is effectively a massive increase to your inventory size. Tears gets one unique ability, though: you can save your builds as QR codes and then share them between friends so you can quickly reconstruct each other’s stuff. That’s a cool idea, but I was a little disappointed that it lacks any sort of built-in sharing or discovery tools to go with it. If you want to see what other people have made, you pretty much have to seek codes out on forums or social media, and I think more likely I just won’t get much use out of this function at all as a result.Now is the time to actually beat Tears of the KingdomFinally, while not specifically relevant to the updated version of this game, a quick PSA/desperate plea from me: please beat Tears of the Kingdom if you haven’t already! The ending is so good. If you beat Breath of the Wild, its okay ending might make you think there’s similarly not much to see here – but the end of Tears is genuinely incredible. The final fight is possibly my favorite in any Zelda game, and the places its story goes are as unexpected as they are awesome. With all these improvements, there’s never been a better time to discover what you missed if you didn’t see it to the end two years ago.That’s my quick look at The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom’s Switch 2 Edition, though I’m certainly excited to see more of it after what I played this past weekend. Once again, this really does feel like the way this game was always meant to be played, and I’m thrilled by the idea of a new generation discovering it for the first time. It’s sure to keep you more than busy until I’m back with my final Switch 2 review in the next week or so.",
