  "text": "The Odyssey will be filmed with 'brand new IMAX film technology.'Universal Pictures has revealed that Christopher Nolan's next film will be The Odyssey, a 'mythic action epic shot across the world using brand new IMAX film technology' that will be released in theaters on July 17, 2026.Nolan's The Odyssey will bring \"Homer's foundational saga to IMAX film screens for the first time\" and will be a retelling of the Ancient Greek epic poem that was first written in the 8th or 7th century BC.Christopher Nolan’s next film ‘The Odyssey’ is a mythic action epic shot across the world using brand new IMAX film technology. The film brings Homer’s foundational saga to IMAX film screens for the first time and opens in theaters everywhere on July 17, 2026.— Universal Pictures (@UniversalPics) December 23, 2024 For those unfamiliar, The Odyssey follows the journey of Odysseus, the king of Ithaca, who travels the world for 10 years in an attempt to get home after the Trojan War. While Universal didn't reveal any further details on Nolan's The Odyssey, reports have already been painting a picture of the stacked cast the film will have.Matt Damon was the first person reported to be in talks to star in Nolan's next film, which marks his return to Universal after 2023's Oppenheimer, which won seven Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. Alongside Damon, reports state he may be joined by Charlize Theron, Tom Holland, Zendaya, Anne Hathaway, Lupita Nyong'o, and Robert Pattinson.Image Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty ImagesWe're obviously excited about Nolan's next film as we gave Oppenheimer a 10/10. In our review, we said, \"A biopic in constant free fall, Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s most abstract yet most exacting work, with themes of guilt writ large through apocalyptic IMAX nightmares that grow both more enormous and more intimate as time ticks on.\"A disturbing, mesmerizing vision of what humanity is capable of bringing upon itself, both through its innovation, and through its capacity to justify any atrocity.\"For more, read about Nolan's very public split with Warner Bros. and which movie we said was the best of 2024.Have a tip for us?
