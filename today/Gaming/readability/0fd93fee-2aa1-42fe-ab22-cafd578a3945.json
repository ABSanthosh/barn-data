  "text": "Over $1000 savings, and $200 less compared to the discount from last week. Image credit: RPS Photo Composite / Dell NVIDIA’s latest GPUs are here, and whatever you think about them, the combination of DLSS, Reflex, frame generation and more makes them impressively capable. Still, that power comes at a cost, but Dell’s Alienware brand is doing its best to make it a little easier to stomach, at least. The manufacturer’s Aurora R16, a prebuilt gaming PC that packs the NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti under the hood, is currently available for just shy of $1750, with a $1050 saving from the MSRP ($2799.99). This particular model has an Intel Core Ultra 265F processor and 16GB of DDR5-56000MHz RAM, as well as a terabyte of storage on an M.2 SSD. Still, you can tweak the build to get up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 (although it’ll naturally send you north of $2000), and you can increase the RAM (up to 64GB) and storage (up to 8TB) with eye-watering costs. You can also downgrade the GPU if you’re on a tight budget, while there’s also an RTX 5080 if you want to go the other way. There’s a keyboard and mouse included in the box, too, and I have to say I do find the case on the Aurora pretty slick. Looking for more PC gaming deals? Check out our full round up for today, including discounts on liquid-cooled desktops, ultrawide screens, budget SSDs, and a laser cutter. My favorite deal from the top picks? It's the Build your own gaming bundle; pay $4.50 a game if you grab three, drop that to $4 each if you pick five or more. Doom Eternal’s in there, which is already worth the entry fee. Add Scorn or Hedon: Extra Thicc Edition if you like your horror. Eleven games total, and they're all solid.",
