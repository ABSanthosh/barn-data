  "text": "Hello again, PlayStation fans! From the start, the enthusiasm of the PlayStation VR2 community has been a source of inspiration for us. At Flat2VR Studios, we’re all VR gamers, just like you. Our journey started with a shared interest in playing the very best games in VR, and that passion continues to fuel everything we do. Today, as part of the VR Games Showcase, we pulled back the curtain on a few of the PS VR2 titles we’ve been working on. Whether you’re into atmospheric horror, fast-paced FPS action, deep-space survival, or chaotic open-world mayhem, we’ve got you covered.  Horror has a way of creeping under your skin in VR like nowhere else, and Out of Sight VR offers a truly unique take on the genre. Developed by The Gang and adapted for VR by Flat2VR Studios, this chilling, atmospheric puzzle adventure puts players in the role of Sophie, a young blind girl who sees through the eyes of her teddy bear.  Trapped in a dark and mysterious mansion, Sophie must navigate its treacherous halls, solve intricate puzzles, and evade the sinister captors lurking in the shadows—all while experiencing the world from a completely unique second-person perspective. Are you ready to step into the darkness?   Roboquest VR  Originally praised for its high-speed movement and roguelite progression, Roboquest VR brings the adrenaline-pumping action of the original game to virtual reality. Developed by Flat2VR Studios in collaboration with RyseUp Studios and Starbreeze Publishing, this fast-paced FPS throws players into a scorched future world overrun by deadly machines.  As a rebooted Guardian, you’ll blast through hand-crafted levels, wielding over 100 weapons—including shotguns, bows, ninja stars, and flamethrowers—while upgrading your abilities and uncovering the secrets of a fallen civilization. And for those who prefer to team up, Roboquest VR will feature full-fledged two-player co-op, letting you and a friend take on the mechanical menace together when the game launches on PlayStation VR2 this Fall.  Shadowgate VR: The Mines of Mythrok Ancient dungeons, arcane magic, and treacherous puzzles await in Shadowgate VR: The Mines of Mythrok, the first-ever VR entry in the legendary Shadowgate franchise. Developed by Zojoi and published for PlayStation VR2 by Flat2VR Studios, this immersive fantasy adventure brings players deep into the mystical halls of Mythrok, where danger lurks around every corner. Armed with a sorcerer’s wand and an enchanted shield, players must solve devious puzzles, battle fearsome creatures, and navigate the ruins of a lost Dwarven kingdom. Guided by Odin, your wise (and often snarky) raven companion, you’ll master elemental magic, ride thrilling minecarts, and uncover the forgotten secrets hidden within the mountain’s depths. Prepare to test your wits, embrace the magic, and step into a world of danger and discovery like never before.  Surviving Mars – Pioneer  Mars is calling, and survival is in your hands. Surviving Mars: Pioneer is a brand-new, made-for-VR survival game set in the Surviving Mars universe, developed by Bolverk Games and published by Flat2VR Studios in association with Paradox Interactive. As a lone settler on the Red Planet, you must establish and maintain an autonomous mining operation, managing oxygen, nutrition, and health while braving the planet’s harsh environment. Every decision—from optimizing your power grid to unlocking new technology and vehicles—determines your success. With a fully hands-on approach to base construction and resource extraction, Surviving Mars: Pioneer brings planetary survival to life in VR. A deep economy system challenges you to mine, export, and expand, while jetpack traversal makes exploring the Martian landscape both thrilling and essential. The Red Planet awaits—will you endure its unforgiving frontier?  Wrath: Aeon of Ruin VR  If you’re a fan of classic ‘90s FPS action, Wrath: Aeon of Ruin VR is going to feel like a dream come true—assuming your dreams are filled with eldritch horrors, cursed ruins, and enough firepower to tear through an army of nightmarish creatures. Developed by Team Beef in collaboration with Flat2VR Studios and 3D Realms, Wrath: Aeon of Ruin VR is built on the legendary Quake engine, bringing back the speed, intensity, and brutality of the best old-school shooters—now fully reimagined for VR. That means redesigned weapons with physical reloading, dual-wielding (including vicious twin blades), and a full VR UI built around quick weapon swaps and artifact activation. You’ll navigate labyrinthine levels, uncover dark secrets, and carve your way through the decaying world of the Old Gods with an arsenal of devastating weaponry when it arrives on PlayStation VR2 this Fall.   Postal 2 VR For the first time ever, Postal 2 is coming to VR, bringing the 2003 cult-classic open-world mayhem to a whole new level. Developed by Team Beef in collaboration with Flat2VR Studios and Running With Scissors, Postal 2 VR delivers the dark humor, absurd action, and over-the-top physics the series is known for—fully reimagined for PlayStation VR2.  Set in the infamous town of Paradise, Arizona, Postal 2 VR puts players in the shoes of The Postal Dude, a man with a week’s worth of errands to complete—though how you go about them is entirely up to you. The game has been completely rebuilt for VR with manual reloading, dual-wielding, and physics-driven melee combat, an overhauled inventory and UI and more. Chaotic, offensive, and endlessly entertaining, Postal 2 VR is an unhinged VR playground like no other.  At Flat2VR Studios, we’re all in when it comes to supporting PlayStation VR2, and every title we’ve shared today is proof that the future is looking brighter than ever.  From brutal action and deep-space survival to atmospheric horror and cult-classic mayhem, we’re bringing an incredibly diverse lineup to PS VR2—but trust us when we say, there’s even more on the way. Some of our biggest reveals are still ahead, and we can’t wait to share what’s next.  So, if you’ve been wondering where the games are, look no further. 2025 is shaping up to be an unforgettable year for PS VR2, and we’re just getting started.",
