  "description": "In WWE 2K25's new Island mode, you'll explore an open-world PvPvE hub full of shops, events, and other players. But one thing you might lose track of is how to change your character's appearance in The Island. In our brief guide, we'll walk you through how to do just that, so your future WWE superstar can look just the way you want them to. Better yet, this same method we'll show you also lets you adjust their moveset to your liking.How to customize your character's appearance and moves in WWE 2K25 The IslandThere's only one way to change what your character looks like in The Island, since it's a mode split off from your library of create-a-wrestlers (CAWs) and your MyRise story mode superstar. When you create your Island character, the game might usher you right past the customization suite, leaving you to need to get back to it after some brief onboarding into the new mode.Once you can freely explore the Island, you'll want to look for a pathway between the pink-colored barber shop and the Nike and Jordan stores. Down that way, you'll see an elaborate building decorated with Cody Rhodes' American Nightmare logo.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Once you can freely explore the Island, you'll want to look for a pathway between the pink-colored barber shop and the Nike and Jordan stores. Down that way, you'll see an elaborate building decorated with Cody Rhodes' American Nightmare logo.Head down the pathway you see in the image behind Larry David here...Head down that pathway and look to the left of Rhodes' hub. There, you'll see a kiosk called MyBooth--these 2K games love branding by removing the space between words. Interact with the circular kiosk to jump into a menu where you can change your wrestler's appearance or moves. There are other MyBooth stations around the Island, but this is the one closest to where you load into the world. Since the mode strangely lacks a map, we'll just say you can generally expect to find a MyBooth kiosk near a few of the distinct zones within the Island hub. There's another one by the Hall of Legends, for example, and another in the Temple of the Ancestors. Everything currently available to your character will be there, and beyond the build options you chose at their creation--like their fighting style, height, and weight--nothing is untouchable, so you can continue to edit them as much as you'd like. As you see in the screenshots here, I tried making Larry David. If you see him around the Island, just leave him be. He hates a stop-and-chat....then interact with MyBooth to change your character's look and moveset.For more on WWE 2K25, don't miss the full Showcase matches list, with all rewards and unlockables detailed.
