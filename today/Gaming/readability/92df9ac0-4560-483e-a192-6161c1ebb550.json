  "text": "Daniel Linssen’s Typing Challenge tasks you with scooting around a dangerous grid by hitting the right keys before you get clobbered. As someone who types for a few hours every single day, I came to this game feeling pretty cocky. All you have to do is navigate a grid of randomized letters by hitting keys to move around. Your main goal is to type your way to the golden letters, collecting them as quickly (and safely) as you can. Get enough of them to fill all of the dark balls on the circle around the gameplay area and you win. Doesn’t exactly sound like something that would be too hard. AND YET… Something about this game made things challenging for me (and has me wondering if my typing skills are more related to memorizing letter patterns for specific words rather than actually knowing the keyboard layout). Having to chase a grid of nonsense around the play field had me hesitating and nearly panicking as I tried to hit the correct keys. Having to do this while tracking the trajectories of the lethal asterisks floating through the arena made this significantly harder, making me take an embarrassing amount of time to find letters I use all the time. It’s not like I was just struggling with “z’ or ‘q’. This surprisingly devilish title had me floundering no matter what letter I was looking for. Daniel Linssen’s Typing Challenge is a stunningly difficult challenge for skilled typists. The pressure of having to figure out the safest route through the letters while figuring out where the keys lie on your keyboard was surprisingly stressful and fun. The game humbled me fast, but its simplicity (and my annoyance at thinking I should be FAR better at it) kept me coming back for another round. Daniel Linssen’s Typing Challenge is available now (for free) on itch.io.
