  "description": "Two is better than one. But then three is better than two, and you get the idea. Co-op gaming can be an absolute blast as you work together with friends to solve puzzles, bring down gigantic beasts, or just annoy each other in goofy ways.2025 looks absolutely stuffed with big-name games and exciting experiences that can be shared together with a friend or even in groups. We're talking a new Monster Hunter entry and an Elden Ring spin-off, for instance, and that just scratches the surface. Below, you will find a lengthy list of our most-anticipated co-op games arranged by release order. Though, do note, not every title has a specific date and will be grouped together near the end. For more, be sure to check out GameSpot's 2025 upcoming games release schedule. Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power BattleDeveloper: AspyrPlatforms: PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4, Nintendo SwitchRelease Date: January 23Swing around a lightsaber to cut down some clankers in this latest Star Wars revival game from Aspyr, which previously brought Knights of the Old Republic 2 and Bounty Hunter to PC and consoles. If desired, you can be the Jedi master as Qui-Gon Jinn while your mate has to be the padawan as Obi-Wan Kenobi. Or, bring balance to the Force of your friendship in couch co-op by selecting from an assortment of other characters in this action arcade game, such as Mace Windu, Queen Padme, or even Jar Jar Binks. See on Fanatical Orcs Must Die: DeathtrapDeveloper: Robot EntertainmentPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|SRelease Date: January 28Become a war mage with up to three other friends and protect the rift in Orcs Must Die: Deathtrap. The name describes the game here, as dispatching orcs with crossbows and magic is of utmost importance with your character. But on top of that, the third-person action game mixes in tower-defense aspects, so you can place traps throughout the map to assist in defeating foes. Between stages, upgrade your abilities, traps, and weapons before taking on a new challenge. It'll be available on day one through Game Pass. See on Steam Sniper Elite: ResistanceDeveloper: RebellionPlatforms: PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4Release Date: January 30Team up to take down Nazis inside France during World War II. Occurring at the same time as Sniper Elite 5, Resistance features first-time main protagonist Harry Hawker. However, the entire campaign can be played through with a comrade online. That means the two of you can giggle at or be disgusted by the franchise's well-known X-ray mode, which showcases how a bullet can rip through human flesh. GameSpot's preview noted that Sniper Elite: Resistance is like a warm serving of comfort food. See on Amazon Monster Hunter WildsDeveloper: CapcomPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5Release Date: February 28There is nothing quite like the thrill of the hunt of an enormous beast in this action-RPG franchise. With Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom is going full open-world--the hub is not a separate area--as well as introducing storms and seasons that affect the landscape. So be prepared to squad up with three other players to brave the elements and bring down fantastical beasts. GameSpot got to go hands-on with the title and believes Monster Hunter Wilds doesn't sacrifice depth while streamlining the experience. See on Fanatical Begone BeastDeveloper: TandemiPlatforms: PCRelease Date: February 2025 (early access)This co-op hack-and-slash game has players wielding flashlights that can transform into weapons like a sword, bow and arrow, and a huge hammer. Oh, and there's a lot of screaming in this roguelike title. Developer Tandemi touts its dynamic AI director and map-outline maker to ensure each run for players is truly unique. See on Steam Split FictionDeveloper: Hazelight StudiosPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5Release Date: March 6There might not be a better co-op developer in the world than Hazelight Studios, which previously created A Way Out and It Takes Two. Like those games, Split Fiction is co-op only (no single-player option) and sees players assuming the roles of writers Zoe and Mio. One is a fantasy author, while the other loves sci-fi tales. Split Fiction sees their words coming to life and has players adventuring through their creative worlds, each featuring different mechanics. See on Amazon Commandos: OriginsDeveloper: Claymore Game StudiosPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5Release Date: March 2025Take on dangerous missions in this World War II tactical stealth game with a friend. The co-op mode works locally or online, letting players tackle challenges like sabotaging their enemies or rescuing allies together in the strategy game. Plus, you get to beat up some Nazis, which is always a good thing. See on Steam Killing Floor 3Developer: Tripwire InteractivePlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5Release Date: March 2025Coming out almost nine years after Killing Floor 2, this new entry in the co-op horror series sees up to six players working together to take down bioengineered monsters. Killing Floor 3 wants to ensure you're properly equipped--along with your buddies--to cut through the enemy Zeds as well. That's why flamethrowers and katanas will be at your disposal. And they will lead to \"even more realistic carnage\" than previously seen in the series, according to developer Tripwire. Killing Floor 3 is also included in GameSpot's most-anticipated horror games for 2025. See on Fanatical Revenge of the Savage PlanetDeveloper: Raccoon Logic StudiosPlatforms: PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4Release Date: May 2025This silly sci-fi sequel sees a major shift in perspective, as Revenge of the Savage Planet has a third-person viewpoint compared to the original's first-person camera. But the goofy humor and poop jokes are back for round two. Speaking of two, Revenge of the Savage Planet sports online and couch co-op, so players can work together to explore four different alien planets. Together, you can lasso odd aliens or jump into strange waters. From there, make these foreign places your own since you're basically a disregarded and fired space explorer. See on Amazon The House of the Dead 2: RemakeDeveloper: MegaPixel StudioPlatforms: PC, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo SwitchRelease Date: Spring 2025 (North America)\"Reload. Reload. Reload.\" Get ready to hear that on repeat in The House of the Dead 2: Remake, a horror rail-shooter game that sees players blasting away zombies. Along with a campaign featuring branching pathways, this title will offer a Boss Rush mode for two people to tackle. The House of the Dead 2: Remake is based on the original arcade game from Sega, which first hit home consoles on Dreamcast in 1999. Developer MegaPixel Studio is updating the visuals as well as remastering the soundtrack, though the original music will be available as well. See on Steam Dying Light: The BeastDeveloper: TechlandPlatforms: PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4Release Date: Summer 2025 (North America)Set in Castor Woods, Dying Light: The Beast sees the return of the first game's protagonist, Kyle Crane. Apparently, he's been a prisoner for over a decade, and in that time was experimented on. But now he's broken free, and fans believe Crane will be able to transform into a beast of sorts, hence the subtitle. However, you don't have to venture out into the game's zombie-infested open world alone. Dying Light: The Beast offers four-player co-op. See on Steam Double Dragon ReviveDeveloper: Yuke'sPlatforms: PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4Release Date: October 23The Lee brothers are returning in a new arcade beat-'em-up, though it's unclear whether this is a remake of the 1987 original or just incorporating past elements from the franchise. Regardless, Double Dragon Revive is promising a playable cast of characters that's bigger than just Billy and Jimmy. Marian, who's the girlfriend kidnapped in the first game, is able to dish out the pain this time, alongside a ninja named Yagyu Ranzo. See on Steam Elden Ring NightreignDeveloper: From SoftwarePlatforms: PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4Release Date: 2025This co-op action-RPG is a standalone spin-off of Elden Ring that focuses on teamwork to take down the Nightlord. Elden Ring Nightreign sees a trio of players venturing out into Limveld where the goal is to survive a \"a three-day-and-night cycle.\" That task will feature Dark Souls enemies, with relics carrying over between runs to help against those foes as the game takes a page from roguelikes.Two important things to keep in mind with this highly anticipated title: Elden Ring Nightreign isn't a live-service game and won't offer cross-play between different platform families. See on Fanatical Subnautica 2Developer: Unknown WorldsPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|SRelease Date: 2025 (early access)This open-water survival sequel is officially offering co-op for up to four players, after Subnautica and its spin-off Below Zero were solo-only affairs. In addition, Subnautica 2 will take place in a new alien ocean full of weird underwater lifeforms and various biomes. Like the previous game, it's all about exploring the deep seas and then returning to build a base as well as crafting. See on Steam FBC: Firebreak Developer: Remedy EntertainmentPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5Release Date: 2025Like Elden Ring Nightreign, FBC: Firebreak is a co-op spin-off to a fan-favorite single-player game--this time being Control. A trio of players will fight against the creepy Hiss enemies from a first-person perspective, another big change from Control. It's up to you, and friends, to bring order back to the Oldest House. See on Steam Borderlands 4 Developer: GearboxPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5Release Date: 2025New vault hunters, a new baddie, and of course, new loot. Those are just a few of the promises for Borderlands 4, the next installment in the widely popular looter-shooter series. Gearbox is also touting that the new game will feature a seamless world and movement mechanics that may make it tough to revisit previous entries in the franchise. As for the humor, it sounds like you won't have to worry about Skibidi or Hawk Tuah jokes. Basically, Borderlands 4 narrative director Sam Winkler wants to cut down on some of the toilet humor. See on Steam Little Nightmares 3Developer: Supermassive GamesPlatforms: PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4, Nintendo SwitchRelease Date: 2025The aim of adding co-op to Little Nightmares 3 is to amp up the scare factor for the series. This time, players can pair up to survive The Maw as the protagonists Low and Alone. The former has a bow at their disposal, while the latter utilizes a wrench. These weapons are needed for the game's puzzles as well as fending off horrific creatures. Like Killing Floor 3, Little Nightmares 3 is also included in GameSpot's most-anticipated horror games for 2025. See on Amazon Terminator: SurvivorsDeveloper: Nacon Studio MilanPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5Release Date: 2025Taking place four years after Judgment Day, Terminator: Survivors sees you and your friends trying to keep mankind alive. As such, this open-world survival game has players searching for materials and other people to build a base. But, of course, Skynet and its machines are on the hunt for you, including the Terminator. The game was originally planned for 2024 but got pushed back to this year. See on Amazon 33 ImmortalsDeveloper: Thunder LotusPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|SRelease Date: Early Access in 2025This action-roguelike boasts the biggest player count for co-op on this list with--you probably guessed it--33 players. 33 Immortals is the next game from the developers behind Spiritfarer and sees them going in a totally different direction that's self-described as \"pick up and raid.\" Basically, the action-RPG plans to offer an MMO-like raid as players go against the wrath of God. Oh, and don't worry about organizing a massive meetup with all of your buddies for 33 Immortals, as the game will offer instant matchmaking. See on Epic Games Store Streets of Rogue 2Developer: TinyBuildPlatforms: PCRelease Date: 2025This sandbox sequel gives you the choice to steal, fight, farm, or hack your way to overthrowing a corrupt president. Streets of Rogue 2 takes inspiration from games like Stardew Valley and Terraria but also does its own chaotic and goofy things. Two ways developer TinyBuild dishes out to tackle the game are creating a zombie outbreak or getting ancient vampires to work with you. Of course, the silliness can be turned up from there by playing locally or online with friends. See on Fanatical Sunderfolk Developer: Secret DoorPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Nintendo SwitchRelease Date: 2025This tactical RPG is inspired by tabletop board games, even requiring a foursome to play together in the same room. On top of that, Sunderfolk has players utilizing a smartphone app to control their anthropomorphic animal (there are six classes to select). There is quite the pedigree behind the game, too, with numerous ex-Blizzard folks working on the project. Game director Erin Marek told GameSpot in December that Gloomhaven is a major inspiration for the title. See on Steam Primal PlanetDeveloper: SeethingswarmPlatforms: PCRelease Date: 2025This metroidvania game sees a cave dweller obtaining crafting tools and exploring a primeval map full of dinosaurs and eventually aliens. But players don't have to adventure alone in Primal Planet as is common in this popular side-scrolling genre. A second person can locally control a sinosauropteryx to help with battling and problem-solving. See on Steam Tears of Metal Developer: Paper CultPlatforms: PCRelease Date: 2025Slice and dice through scores of foes in this co-op action roguelike, which gives off some Braveheart vibes thanks to the Scottish setting. Each run will see you trying to learn more about a dragon meteor. This rock is apparently responsible for your enemies, as well as some mysterious powers. See on Steam Gears of War: E-Day Developer: The CoalitionPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|SRelease Date: TBASometimes you have to go back to go forward. That's what The Coalition is doing with Gears of War: E-Day, a new entry in the storied series that's set 14 years before the original game. That means players will assume the role of a young Marcus Fenix and his buddy, Dom, as they face off against the Locusts when they first emerge on Sera. The prequel was announced at the Xbox Games Showcase 2024, and details have been sparse since then. However, The Coalition will utilize Unreal Engine 5 for the third-person, cover-based shooter. See on Steam Stage Fright Developer: Ghost Town GamesPlatforms: PCRelease Date: TBAFrom the creators of Overcooked, Stage Fright looks to mix elements from its frantic chef-inspired game with the silly spookiness of Luigi's Mansion. Ghost Town Games says that the goal with the co-op title is to stretch your mind with escape-room challenges instead of focusing on quick reflexes. The experience will offer online and couch co-op.
