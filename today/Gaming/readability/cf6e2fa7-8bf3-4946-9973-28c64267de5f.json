Fantasy Critic League – Like Fantasy Football, but for Video Games We had some big moved on the field this past week, but first we need to show where we left off the week before. The Standings for Week 15 There is was, the way things stood at the end of week fifteen.  Of particular note is Bhagpuss, whom I had managed to push down from fifth to sixth position in the rankings as shipped titles in our rosters fluctuated slightly in score.  Bhagpuss was also projected by the site as headed for seventh place at the end of the season. And then last week happened, starting off with a release for Bhagpuss. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has released! [Picked by Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss)] Now has a score of 91.6 That was a big enough score, and Bhagpuss’ third title released, to push him up into second place… and everybody previously in second through fifth down a peg. Publisher Score Updates Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss) Score has gone UP from 24.4 to 33.9 Moved from 6th place to 2nd place Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey) Moved from 2nd place to 3rd place Slightly Scuffed Studios (Kluwes) Moved from 3rd place to 4th place Play Forever Mwahahaha (Shintar) Moved from 4th place to 5th place TAGN HQ (Wilhelm) Moved from 5th place to 6th place And then we had two more releases.  One was for Bhagpuss. Old Skies has released! [Picked by Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss)] Now has a score of 79.4 And the other was for Archey. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves has released! [Picked by Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey)] Now has a score of 80.5 Though that saw a one point dip pretty quickly based on later reviews. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves [Picked by Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey)] Score has gone DOWN from 80.5 to 79.4 Those releases managed to boost Bhagpuss up into first place. Publisher Score Updates Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss) Score has gone UP from 33.9 to 55.7 Moved from 2nd place to 1st place Hare Brained Schemes (p0tsh0t) Moved from 1st place to 2nd place Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey) Score has gone UP from 31.9 to 42.8 Archey, who had a near 10 point boost in score was still almost five points short of second place. Given all of that, at the end of the week the scoreboard ended up looking like this. The Standings for Week 16 Bhagpuss not only jumped to first place, but the site updated its projection for him, jumping from 7th to 2nd place.  And during the week it had him up as a possible 1st place finish before Potshot recovered and reclaimed that nod from the league.  Still, his outlook improved significantly, at least in the eyes of the algorithm. Meanwhile, we had one bid this week.  It was for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered. I put in the bid because I had only heard that it was for real this week.  Over in the other league I play in somebody bid on it the week before, but the data on it was pretty vague.  Then, on Tuesday of this past week it got an update: The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered [Picked by Publisher withheld (*name withheld*)] Game name changed from Unannounced Elder Scrolls Oblivion Re-Something to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered. Release date changed from ‘Unannounced’ to ‘Tuesday, April 22, 2025’. Announcement date changed from ‘No Date’ to ‘Tuesday, April 22, 2025’. Note removed: ‘This is heavily rumored now, but we will not be making a final judgement on it’s classification until it is announced.’. Note added: ‘Despite the name, the consensus is that this is a remake. ‘. Tags changed from Unannounced Game to Remake. That was followed a bit later by one final update: The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered [Picked by Publisher withheld (*name withheld*)] Note removed: ‘Despite the name, the consensus is that this is a remake. ‘. Note added: ‘After extensive Discord debate, we have descided that this is a Remake despite the name. It is not going to change, so you will need to override in your leagues if you disagree So basically nobody knew this was really coming until it was here… except for somebody who might have had insider knowledge… cough you know who you are cough… I mean, look at the name it had up until Tuesday… and then got adjusted in the league on the day it was announced which was also the day it launched. But it did not have a score yet!   The league had not declared it released!  No score, no release announcement, still open to be bid on!  So I immediately put in my bid. And then scores started rolling in and my bid was declared void because a title can’t have a score on it when bids are resolved… also, it can’t be marked as having been released.  So it didn’t matter that there was no score and no release announcement when I initially bid.  I was denied. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered TAGN HQ (Wilhelm)’s bid of $16 did not succeed: Game is no longer eligible: That game has already been released. AND That game already has a score. And, of course, the initial score looked very promising, just to rub my nose in it. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered Now has a score of 88.3 It was possible that a remake of an extremely popular old school Elder Scrolls game might even go higher.  I was bummed. In the end, however, it started going down instead. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered Score has gone DOWN from 88.3 to 86.2 The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered Score has gone DOWN from 86.2 to 85 The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered Score has gone DOWN from 85.0 to 83.6 I mean, 83.6 isn’t a league beater, but it would have been better than any of the three titles that have shipped for me so far.  But still, I didn’t miss out on a 90+ title.  That might have gotten me out of being projected for last place. So that was that. As for next week… we’ve got nothing on the board set to ship until May 15th. Upcoming for Week 17 So, unless there are some updated release dates or some fresh bids, things should be quiet. We did have two release updates: EA Sports College Football 26 [Picked by Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane)] Release date changed from ‘Summer 2025’ to ‘Thursday, July 10, 2025’. Ghost of Yōtei [Picked by Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey)] Release date changed from ‘2025’ to ‘Thursday, October 02, 2025’ Both of those went from wide open ranges to very specific dates.  So it goes. And next week… we’ll have to see if anything new pops up. Addendum: The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered Score has gone DOWN from 83.9 to 81.5 At least it is now below my best pick so far.  The rules may have saved me on that one.  Also, nostalgia isn’t all it is cracked up to be at times I guess.
