  "text": "Warning: Rambling old man rant ahead.  You are free to skip this. Being an AI skeptic is starting to feel like being that person who was against calculators, or digital clocks, or ballpoint pens. Have you ever been around somebody who really dislikes ballpoint pens, somebody for whom the actual application of ink to paper is such an important aspect of writing… perhaps more important that the actual words and their meaning… that if you are not drawing in liquid ink and guiding it onto the page with a gold alloy nib you might as well be working with crayons in their eyes?  You might as well be a primitive splashing paint on a cave wall by the light of your fire as you jot down your shopping list on a Post-it note with that Bic Cristal… though you probably don’t even have that, but rather some cheap Bic knock-off with some local business’s address and phone number on it. Those people exist.  They do.  You can find them.  They, like any connoisseur of any particular art or skill, believe the world would be, if not better, at least a richer and fuller experience if we all just cared as much about the act of applying ink to paper as they did. I am a heretic on that front as I have been writing with a keyboard… first on an old typewriter that I wrote about here, then on a portable I received later… and honestly feel the world is made marginally worse every time I have to write with a pen, a belief that has only strengthen with time.  I have a few of my college notebooks in a drawer, which I keep around only to remind myself I could, at some point in my life, write legibly.  If my Econ 1A and 1B notes are to be trusted, I used to carry around multiple colors of pens!  Who was this person? My grandfather felt the same way about digital clocks and used to pester me about being able to tell time via the classic analog 12 hour clock face, testing me with a teaching clock he had bought because he feared the downfall of society if kids couldn’t be trusted to decipher when it was 7:38 or some such. This irked me no end and I used to deliberately transpose the big hand and the little hand in my answers just to exasperate him.  I feel like I should travel back in time and point out to him that literally every classroom I was ever in from kindergarten through college had an analog clock in it so that digital watch I received for Christmas, back when we though digital watches were a pretty neat idea, wasn’t going to render me incapable of telling time. Honestly, if he’d turned that effort towards quizzing me in converting to 24 hour time and the offset from UTC I think we would have both been better off. Just to round out my opener, I also lived through the moral panic around calculators and how they were going to create a generation of imbeciles who couldn’t do simple math.  At one point, when we were allowed calculators for tests I used to bring in my programmable HP into which I had coded all the formulas being covered… only to find that my having to take apart those formulas sufficiently to be able to program them into the calculator required me to learn them to the point that I ended up not needing the programmed function.  I still used the calculator for a lot of simple things, but mostly because my dad declined to teach me the tricks to doing math in your head, which I had to learn later. And so on and so forth.  Laser printers were going to mean nobody knew how to read cursive, spell checkers were going to make us all illiterate, and Wikipedia was going to fill out head with lies because ANYBODY could edit it.  People were admonished not to believe Wikipedia… and yet we survived… or at least the lies we choose to believe have little to do with Wikipedia. Which brings me around to AI.  I have been critical of AI mostly due to it being programmed to give users what they want over actual facts.  You can bully AI into agreeing to most anything because it does not operate from a principle of being factually correct. This seems like a problem to me, and a problem not being taken very seriously.  Google and Microsoft hanging a little sign in their UI that says answers may be incorrect is not a plan, it is a dodge.  I know, they expect AI to get better if only they can throw a trillion more data samples and seventeen more data centers at the problem… and when you raise an eyebrow to this constantly recycled “if we had more data and could process it faster…” response, the AI crowd gets defensive and starts blaming the prompts being submitted.  If you want verified facts you needed to say the magic word assumes when you ask the AI something that unless you state explicitly that it shouldn’t make things up that it is free to… well… make things up. And so you get stories about how the Chicago Sun-Times, a reputable old school newspaper, included a supplement about 15 books for your summer reading pleasure that only contained five real books. The paper delegated the supplement to Hearst who handed it to their King Features syndication group, who gave the assignment to some freelancer who gets paid by the word who asked an AI and nobody along the chain bothered to do even the most perfunctory check of the information until it was bundled and being tossed onto the lawn of their remaining few subscribers and posted to their web site. I laugh at these things… because they keep coming up… and wonder what will happen when this AI thing actually catches on, forgetting that I am on my own little technological desert island and the rest of the world is well past me, including the youths.  Especially the youths. So it was a bit of a reality check when I read this story over at NY Magazine about AI use by students at Columbia. (That link is semi-paywalled, they allow you to view a couple articles for free each month, but if you open the link a few times you’ll find yourself over the limit.) The main thread follows a student who uses AI to basically do all of their course work because they are at Columbia to find two people, a spouse and a business partner for their first startup.  They don’t want to be bothered by the busy work, they have some core classes they want to take and networking to do.  Their whole motivation to go to an Ivy League school was the latter, the networking, the building the relationships for success.  (And their first startup project… a system that lets you cheat on employment tests with AI!  It comes full circle and the student becomes the master… or something.) All of which is an interesting story with twists and turns, but it is told against a background of a campus where literally everyone they talk to is using ChatGPT to do their assignments.  Seriously, the one student they spoke to who said basically everybody but themselves was cheating, didn’t think they were cheating because they only used ChatGPT to outline their papers and then they filled in the appropriate supporting material. And this isn’t just happening at Columbia.  It has to be everywhere.  Higher education is now being flooded with so much AI output that there is no way any professor can deal with it.  The university administration won’t let you flunk a whole class.  It would be bad for business, no matter what the school’s code of conduct says.  And college, in the US at least, is very much a business at the undergraduate level.  They have created a system where an bachelor’s degree is required for even the most menial white collar job now and where through FASFA, the government created system for student financial aid, gives every institution to which your child applies your entire financial picture so they can calculate exactly how much you can afford to pay, and then maximize their takes for each student.  The game is rigged… but isn’t it always? Only now you’re paying for what?  The piece of paper at the end?  Where is the value in the process?  What do you get from a degree that doesn’t require you to actually physically do or create something?  I was already dubious about every bachelors in communications from Arizona State, but now how do you tell if somebody learned anything? This put my brain into the moral panic mode of previous generations.  I was my grandfather worried about the impact of little me not being able to tell time… only part of my brain was saying “except THIS TIME it is a real issue!” I mean, what are the implications of a generation of students who blow through most of their classes without ever engaging?  We already bemoan the fact that the tech nerds like Zukerberg and Musk all think they are John Galt because they saw all of their general ed and humanities classes as irrelevant BS.  What happens when they don’t even have to read the materials? AI is recent enough still that those students probably could still do the work.  And, I guess it the “real world” after school nobody cares about how you got your results, just that you got them.  So maybe for is a class of work for which AI is an okay result.  But you don’t need to spend the money on a four year college to do that work, do you?  Something will need to change on that front to make a bachelor’s degree worth the low to mid six figures it can cost at a well regarded school. And that brings me around to another recent bit of news, Musk’s AI, Grok, promoting views on white genocide on X in basically every response to any question.  This was such a ham-fisted attempt by Musk to inject his personal racism into every discussion that we are all able to point and laugh at the transparent absurdity.  But it is also a lesson in how those who create and own the AIs can shape the results they provide. Scientific research has a long history of testing on white males and assuming what applies to them is good enough for anybody.  What happens… what is happening… when the disgruntle incels are driving the progress?  The New York Times is out there freely declaring (yes, paywall, sorry) that we can’t make iPhones in the US because Young Chinese women have small fingers, so… something?  Love me some mainstream media mendacious medical trivia.  And that will be fed into the AI and become part of the meta.  (Though, to be fair to AI, Google’s scores this as racist stereotype.  But the NYT isn’t that high of a bar to clear of late, bu twhat happens when a host of other sources pick up the idea, or that Google decides that it too wants to keep making phones in China?) Or, given the current state of affairs in the US, what happens when the president issues an executive order demanding that any general use AI reflect his own personal world view on an array of issues?  Or what if the blockchain crowd decides the way to keep their scam going is to buy into AI and have it promote their plan to tax the internet? There were already plenty of AI doom scenarios, like what happens when AI generates so much garbage content that all the AIs… and they are all starved for training material… are basically digesting each others poop like some digital version of the human centipede? I don’t have any good answers.  I am old enough that when I ask difficult questions the young enthusiasts dismiss them.  But I was young once too, and I know the secret of their enthusiasm, the basis of their dismissal of my sour view.  They don’t have a plan.  The Silicon Valley way is to do something first, then figure out the repercussions later.  Move fast and break things is the motto… always espoused by people rich enough to be insulated from the results of any breakage.",
