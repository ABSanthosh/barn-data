  "text": "Sure, housing for WoW sounds great… but what if you only play WoW Classic?  How is that going? Well I logged back in to Cataclysm Classic and found myself in a very empty Dalaran.  I was in Dalaran because everybody was still doing Wintergrasp to farm honor when we last played and it had been, if not exactly Wrath level busy, then still had people lingering there to finish up some of that content.  Now it seemed empty of players. Wilhelm in Dalaran I grabbed my brew of the month from the mail box while an occasional NPC wished me a happy lunar new year.  I went through the portal to Stormwind and found people there, at least in the nexus around the bank, mailbox, inn, and auction house… but not so many as I expected. Admittedly, I am playing on the US PvE-RP server, which has not been a hotbed of activity since Outland launched I suppose.  Still, it felt a bit telling… One of the side points of interest to me with the WoW Classic experiment… and it feels very much like an experiment at this point, with Blizz testing ideas… or just throwing things against the wall to see what sticks if you prefer… is how much the progression track version of WoW Classic is confirming my own past biases. Can you re-run a cataclysm?  A boring cataclysm?  Blizz is sure going to try! Seriously, part of my own fascination with the whole WoW Classic experiment was to measure my memories, set a decade or more in the past, against what the content felt like on a second, fresh run.  Would the heights be as high?  Would the valleys be as low?  Was there really an annoying content gap in the late 30s to mid 40s?  Was the Stranglethorn Vale quest level cadence as aggressive as I remembered? I rather expected I might be faced with one of those moments when you realize some song lyric you have been playing in your head for years turns out to be mis-remembered and you’ve been wrong all this time. But here we are, more than five years into the experiment and… I feel like pretty much most of my memories and things I suspected might have been biases based on a negative personal experience were pretty much correct.  I have spent no small amount of time going back to read old posts about this and that and… maybe the heights were not as high nor the valleys as low in the replay, the pattern remained about the same. I am going to caveat that with a big “for me” (and not “fourmi”) in this case, but let’s not pretend I can speak for anybody besides myself. So vanilla was charming, did have that content gap, and all of that.  Likewise, my bias against The Burning Crusade and its overland and crafting content, which were clearly designed to be a slog to keep people going for two years while they worked on the next expansion, were not enjoyable.  I was as happy in WoW Classic as I was back during the original to see that expansion in my rear view mirror. Likewise, Wrath of the Lich King, while not perfection, was a much better experience and seems likely to be the part of WoW Classic where I played through the most overland content with the most alts. Which, of course, brings us to Cataclysm.  My memories there get a big vague as I retain a sense of dislike but I also feel like I didn’t play the expansion very much for a few reasons, not the least of which was that our group decided to re-roll new characters to play through the revamped 1-60 content, only to find the difficulty curve so toned down and the leveling curve so sped up that we were not at all engaged.  We ended up just leaving and not coming back to WoW until the far end of Mists of Pandaria… so there is another expansion with some odd memories. But here we are.  The pre-patch for Cataclysm Classic landed nine months ago and… we stopped playing three months ago.  I know because the reason I logged in was to collect the renewal prize for my six month subscription plan… a pet in classic, a mount in retail… and I couldn’t remember the last time we had played. The Year of the Snake gifts After fumbling around a bit until I remembered that the guild stuff had been moved as Blizz upgraded a lot of the UI elements to be like retail,  There I was able to find the time stamp of our last messages in guild chat. Chat log preserved from Nov 3, 2024 The guild roster confirmed that, aside from myself, nobody else in the guild had bothered to log in for the last three months. The level 85 characters in our guild And yeah, sure, that corresponds with us picking up Enshrouded.  But we picked up Enshrouded because we were feeling pretty well done with Cataclysm.  If there was even a spark of interest somebody would be logging in.  But no.  I feel like the verdict is in; Cataclysm was as dull as I remembered. So when are we getting to the next thing?  When are we getting to Mists of Pandaria?  What does the roadmap say? Blizzard WoW Classic 2025 Roadmap Summer.  We’re not getting anything until then.  And that is the pre-patch and related events, the big Mists of Pandaria logo is just filling up space in the middle of Cataclysm time, trying to obscure the “nothing going on” there all spring.  The “launch” on that roadmap isn’t until autumn, so we’re a good six months away from anything at all interesting to our group. When I first glanced at that roadmap the Mists of Pandaria logo fooled me and I thought we were going to have to suffer through a full year of Cataclysm.  But it will be closer to a year and a half.  I don’t know.  Maybe Blizz wants people to go play WoW Classic Classic or… retail?  Are they trying to bore us into retail? Welp, if we get done with Enshrouded, there might be Dune Awakening launching… though private servers for that are not yet a thing.  Maybe Nightingale?  Palia?  A return to No Man’s Sky?  Or maybe something as yet unknown.  But I suspect that Cataclysm won’t be on the menu until we need to warm up for Pandaria.",

related events, the big \u003cem\u003eMists of Pandaria\u003c/em\u003e logo is just filling up space in the middle of \u003cem\u003eCataclysm\u003c/em\u003e time, trying to obscure the “nothing going on” there all spring.  The “launch” on that roadmap isn’t until autumn, so we’re a good six months away from anything at all interesting to our group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I first glanced at that roadmap the \u003cem\u003eMists of Pandaria\u003c/em\u003e logo fooled me and I thought we were going to have to suffer through a full year of \u003cem\u003eCataclysm\u003c/em\u003e.  But it will be closer to a year and a half.  I don’t know.  Maybe Blizz wants people to go play \u003cem\u003eWoW Classic Classic\u003c/em\u003e or… retail?  Are they trying to bore us into retail?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWelp, if we get done with \u003cem\u003eEnshrouded\u003c/em\u003e, there might be \u003cem\u003eDune Awakening\u003c/em\u003e launching… though private servers for that are not yet a thing.  \u003cem\u003eMaybe Nightingale?  Palia?\u003c/em\u003e  A return to \u003cem\u003eNo Man’s Sky?\u003c/em\u003e  Or maybe something as yet unknown.  But I suspect that \u003cem\u003eCataclysm\u003c/em\u003e won’t be on the menu until we need to warm up for Pandaria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
