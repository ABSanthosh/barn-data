  "text": "Captain Corgi: Planetary Problem Solver takes a pair of helpful puzzle-solving dogs on adventures across planets inspired by fairy tales. All dogs want to be good boys, but in this game, you take helping people to the next level as you explore different planets in the galaxy. A lot of these planets and their stories are based on classic story books which you may already know. Captain Corgi: Planetary Problem Solver isn’t a very long game, but you will have some puzzles to solve and some problems to try to fix along the way. Sometimes, you might not even be fixing a problem anyone has presented to you, but instead, you’ll be following rumors of the town in an attempt to find an issue and then fix it. The characters within this game are a little… quirky, with their own personalities and suggestions on how you can help. You are also not alone either – your brother Lem is trying to help you with your quest. The cutscenes where he is talking logically and you are ignoring him are quite funny, giving a good break from problem solving! I got the chance to play the first chapter at The Mix, where I enjoyed this twist on Little Red Riding Hood (who maybe didn’t even need my help after all). Flying through the galaxy is also fun, as your ship sort of sails on a wave of time, making its way to new areas and new planets that might-maybe-probably have some sort of problem for you to solve. Captain Corgi: Planetary Problem Solver doesn’t take itself too seriously, and that’s where a lot of the fun is. It’s a little narative game that feels full of silly moments and adventure while somehow being slightly familiar in the stories that you are trying to put yourself into. Captain Corgi: Planetary Problem Solver is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
