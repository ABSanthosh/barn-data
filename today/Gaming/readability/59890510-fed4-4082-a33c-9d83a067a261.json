  "text": "Playtesting also expanding soon. Image credit: EA EA has confirmed its next Battlefield game is still on track to launch before next April, with a full reveal due this \"summer\", following several months of invite-only playtests. EA CEO Andrew Wilson shared the news of Battlefield's imminent reveal as part of the company's Q4 and financial year 2025 earnings report. \"As we look to the future, we're confident in our ability to execute across a deep pipeline,\" he wrote, \"beginning this summer with the highly anticipated reveal of Battlefield, a pivotal step in delivering on our next generation of blockbuster entertainment.\" The publisher also recommitted to its previously announced FY26 release window for Battlefield, meaning the game is still on track to launch before April next year. Back in February, Wilson suggested EA might be willing to delay its next Battlefield if \"some things happening in the year\" meant that \"wasn't a great window for us\" - seemingly an oblique reference to GTA 6, which has since been delayed into May next year. Introducing Battlefield Labs | Battlefield Studios EA and DICE teased new Battlefield gameplay in February.Watch on YouTube EA has previously shared some lofty goals for its next Battlefield, saying it wants it to be the \"biggest [series entry] we've ever made.\" To that end, it's been running invite-only playtests since March as it seeks to \"get the community back on [its] side\" following the poorly received Battlefield 2042 - which quickly became one of Steam's worst-reviewed games of all time after its launch in 2021, and was later acknowledged to have flopped. While EA's recent Battlefield playtests have resulted in a flurry of leaked footage, little has been officially revealed beyond the fact it's set in the modern day, and will bring back traditional classes and more focused maps after the unpopular changes made in Battlefield 2042. There've also been suggestions, based on landmarks sighted in the single bit of concept art shared last year, that the series might be heading to Gibraltar. But with a full reveal due this \"summer\" - perhaps at this year's Summer Game Fest - there shouldn't be too long until we learn more. Before then, however, EA has announced plans to \"continue scaling Battlefield Labs testing globally\", saying it'll begin inviting more players across Europe, North America, and select areas of Asia throughout May. These playtest will include new content, as well as further testing of weapon balancing, damage values, plus \"movement and combat pacing mechanics\". Away from Battlefield, EA has confirmed its free-to-play Skate reboot is similarly due to launch before April 2026. Previously, developer Full Circle said it remains committed to its 2025 early access release window, although a more specific date is yet to be shared.",
