  "text": "The graphic novel collection of the five-part mini comic book series, is out now and on sale.I'd argue one of the biggest comic storylines of the past half-decade came not from people in spandex and capes, but instead from half-shell heroes in the IDW mini-series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin. Now, the sequel series picks up 15 years after the conclusion of the original storyline with a new team of turtles released as an all-in-one collection – Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin II: Re-Evolution. To celebrate this release, Amazon has it on sale for $24.49. As an added bonus, even with it being Prime Day, you don’t need a Prime membership to take advantage of this deal.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin II--Re-EvolutionTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin II--Re-EvolutionThe Last Ronin II graphic novel that combines all five issues of the comic mini-series,Re-Evolution isn’t a brand-new comic; instead, it is a graphic novel that combines the five issues that composed The Last Ronin II’s story into a single release. As someone who grew up with the 1987 animated turtles series, the original Last Ronin broke me, but being able to step foot back in this timeline with Ronin II felt a bit cathartic for me. Despite being their own characters, the new mutants do things that make me want to believe they would get along just fine with Donny, Leo, Raph, and Mikey. For fans of any era of Turtles, the Last Ronin and Ronin II stories are must-reads and thanks to its popularity with fans, we already know that the original tale is getting its own video game courtesy of Black Forest Games and even a live-action movie that is planned to be rated R to do justice to the dark nature and tone of this series. Hopefully, with the release of this Re-Evolution graphic novel, Odyn, Yi, Uno, and Moja will endear themselves to audiences enough that we see them hit the silver screen or game console in the future as well. In the meantime, snag this book while it's on sale because it really kicks some shell. Other Prime Day DealsDid we mention it's Prime Day? Amazon is running its big annual sale through the rest of the week, with deals on pretty much anything you can think of. Highlights so far include Audible Premium for $0.99, discounts on the latest Kindle and a \"Buy 2 Get 1 Free\" deal on books and Blu-rays.
