Right now, you can pick up The Complete Calvin and Hobbes Hardcover Box Set for only $83.33 shipped after you clip a $41.66 off coupon on the product page. This is the lowest price of the year and easily beats out the deal we saw during Amazon Prime Day (it was on sale for $100 back then). This box set would make for a wonderful gift idea for both adults and kids alike.The Complete Calvin and Hobbes Hardcover Box SetThe Complete Calvin and Hobbes Hardcover Box SetClip the $41.66 off coupon on the product pageThis set consists of three full-color hardcover volumes (1,440 total pages) contained in a sturdy slipcase. The collection includes every Calvin and Hobbes cartoon that ever appeared in syndication, from its initial publication in 1985 to Bill Watterson's retirement in 1995. This is as much an incredible gift to the millennial who has fond memories of reading Calvin and Hobbes in the Sunday morning newspaper to a Gen Alpha kid who hasn't been introduced to the series yet.At its current price, the hardcover set is actually less expensive than the paperback set. I doubt the price will drop any lower for Black Friday. In fact, it's more likely that the deal won't come back once it expires. If you've always wanted to add this timeless classic to your collection, or you want to introduce this delightful series to someone who's never had the privilege of experiencing it, I'd definitely recommend jumping on this deal before it's too late.Looking for More Book Deals?Amazon is currently offering a Buy Two, Get One Free deal on select books. That does include The Calvin and Hobbes paperback edition, although sadly the hardcover edition isn't eligible. Amazon is definitely one of the best places to buy books online, but it's certainly not the only option. Target, for example, is hosting a very similar B2G1 Free sale on books and, depending on where you're located, you can even have it delivered or pick it up the same day.When Is Black Friday 2024?The actual date of Black Friday in 2024 falls on November 29, but the holiday deals season starts a lot earlier than that. Plenty of retailers have already been dropping deals online. (This usually starts in the last week of October, just before Halloween.) More and more deals will roll out leading up to the event, which culminates in massive discounts on Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Bdeals until the big day, but many deals will be available well in advance.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
