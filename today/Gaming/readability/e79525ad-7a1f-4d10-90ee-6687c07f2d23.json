  "text": "Don't forget about a cheeky RAM upgrade too. Image credit: Dell and Basesailor Checked the deals this morning and found some epic picks worth sharing. There’s good value across the board, from fast storage and memory upgrades to dependable gear for your setup. A few of these are steeply discounted and won’t hang around long. If you’ve been thinking about upgrading or just need reliable hardware, now’s a good time to jump in. Let's get into it: These little adapters have saved me more than once. From plugging in a USB drive to my laptop or charging my controller on the go, this four-pack covers every angle. At just four bucks, it’s cheaper than your coffee and way more useful. This Aurora rig is stacked. RTX 5080, Intel Ultra 7 chip, 16GB DDR5 RAM, and a 1TB SSD—all cooled and powered by a 1000W platinum PSU. For under $1,600 after email signup, it’s a futureproof gaming beast that’s ready to dominate 4K and ray tracing with no sweat. Ultrawide gaming doesn’t get much better than this. A 3440×1440 QD-OLED panel at 180Hz delivers immersive visuals with rich contrast and silky motion. It’s built for shooters, racers, and anything cinematic. For $329, it’s a curve worth diving into. This little card packs serious punch. Perfect for your Switch (Gen 1), Steam Deck, or ROG Ally, it loads games fast and holds a ton. 512GB for just $26.99 is a killer deal—especially with up to 160MB/s read speeds. Toss it in your handheld and stop deleting games every weekend. Gaming feeling choppy? This DDR5 kit gets your rig up to speed with 6000MHz performance and low latency. Intel or AMD, it’s a smooth drop-in. Big upgrade for not a lot of cash. If your case fans sound like a jet engine or just plain suck, swap in these ARCTIC P12s. Five quiet, pressure-optimized fans for under $30? No-brainer for better airflow and way less noise. This is high refresh gaming at its finest. QHD resolution, 360Hz speed, and OLED contrast? It’s buttery smooth and insanely responsive—perfect for esports or just flexing visuals. Down $280? Yes please. Need space for your whole Steam library and then some? This 4TB NVMe SSD hits speeds over 7,000MB/s. It’s fast, efficient, and surprisingly cool under pressure. For $234.99, your load times won’t know what hit them. This controller just feels good. Textured grip, solid build, and a slick color that pops. It's my go-to controller for anything that isn't a shooter.",
