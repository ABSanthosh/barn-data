  "text": "It doesn't take an expert to see that graphics cards are much more expensive than they've been in the past. Hell, even a 'Budget GPU' like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti will still set you back a solid $450. That's the same price the GTX 1070 Ti launched for back in 2014. Still, a $450 graphics card like the RTX 4060 Ti is way more affordable than the $1,199 (to start) RTX 4080 that's backing up the best gaming PCs on the market right now. TL;DR - These are the Best Budget GPUs:Even with that lower price tag, though, you can still get an extremely good gaming experience, provided you temper your expectations a bit. While the RTX 4060, for instance, isn't exactly a 4K gaming card, it absolutely shines at 1080p games, and is probably the best graphics card for anyone still using the most popular display resolution (according to the latest Steam Hardware Survey). So, no, you don't need to spend thousands of dollars to get a great gaming PC, even in 2024, even if it is a little bit more expensive than it used to be. I've been reviewing graphics cards for years now, and because I've gone hands-on with every GPU on this list, I can stand by their performance, especially for the price tag. Contributions by Kegan Mooney and Georgie PeruWhat is a Budget GPU?These days, graphics cards are more expensive than they've ever been, with some Nvidia graphics cards reaching up to $2,000, while cheaper cards are still selling for hundreds of dollars. It used to be that a budget graphics card would run you around $200 and deliver a solid 1080p gaming experience in the latest games, but that's not really the case anymore. For instance, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti could be considered a budget graphics card by today's standards, and that will set you back $399. So, it's a game of perspective, really. If a high-end graphics card is around $1,000 and a mid-range graphics card like the AMD Radeon RX 7800 is around $499, a budget graphics card would be somewhere in the range of $200 to $300. There are definitely ultra-cheap graphics cards that you can find lower than that, but at that point, you're going to need to compromise and get a last-generation GPU. That doesn't mean the performance will be bad, though. An RTX 3060 or RTX 2060 will still be awesome at 1080p, even if you miss out on some modern features. All you need to do is ask yourself if you really need the best ray tracing. Chances are you can live without it. RTX 4060 Ti Founders Edition1. ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti OC EditionThe Best Budget Graphics CardAsus TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti OC EditionOutputx3 DisplayPort 1.4a x1, HDMI 2.1Impressive 1440p PerformanceIf you're setting out to play your PC games at 1080p, or even 1440p, the RTX 4060 Ti is a no-brainer if you're trying to build a solid rig at a decent price. When I reviewed the RTX 4060 Ti, I found that even at 1440p, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti is easily able to max out Cyberpunk 2077, hitting an average of 62 fps. That's not bad considering that even four years after it came out, Cyberpunk is still one of the hardest PC games to run at higher resolutions, especially with all the eye candy enabled. The GPU does even better in non-ray traced games, too. The graphics card hits an average of 68 fps in Total War: Warhammer 3 at 1440p, and does even better, hitting 102 fps at 1080p. For a budget GPU in 2024, you can't really ask for better performance without risking the price tag creeping up even higher. Now, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti is kind of on the high-end of 'budget', with this Asus TUF variant costing $439 at the time of writing. That amount of cash used to get you a high-end graphics cards, but in the current market, it's definitely on the lower end, without having to rely on the second-hand market. What makes the Asus TUF model special is that, even though this is a 159W card, it's still rocking a triple-fan setup, which means temperatures are going to be kept in control no matter how hard you push it. However, with the size that a triple-fan cooler brings with it, you might have a bit of trouble getting this graphics card to fit into smaller PC cases. If you have the room for it in your rig, though, this is an excellent entry-level graphics card, especially if you want to start messing with ray tracing features in newer PC games.2. Acer Predator BiFrost Intel Arc A770Best Budget Intel GPUAcer Predator BiFrost Intel Arc A770The Intel Arc A770 is perfect for anyone looking to get into PC gaming without spending a thousand bucks on a GPU.Output: x1 HDMI 2.1, x3 DisplayPort 2.0Solid ray tracing performanceSome compatibility issuesIntel is a relative newcomer to discrete GPUs, and while it offers incredible value and impressive performance vs AMD and Nvidia GPUs, its graphics cards aren’t perfect yet.Intel Arc graphics cards were first released in 2022, providing much-needed competition to Nvidia. But being a newcomer to producing graphics cards, there have been some concerns around compatibility. But, if you’re looking for a capable GPU on a budget, the Intel Arc A770 offers some of the best value for money on the market today.As the Intel Arc range progresses, hopefully, we can expect to see future driver updates patch up any compatibility issues, which would make them a serious contender.Radeon RX 76003. Gigabyte AMD Radeon RX 7600 OCBest Budget AMD GPUGigabyte AMD Radeon RX 7600 OCOutputx2 HDMI 2.1, x2 DisplayPort 1.4aUnderwhelming ray tracing performanceBuying a more affordable graphics card is an exercise in compromise. Because while the AMD Radeon RX 7600 is not a card I'd recommend for anyone that wants to use ray tracing, it's still awesome at traditional 1080p gaming. Because let's be real, who needs fancy ray tracing tech when you just want to play Phasmophobia with your friends?In my review for the AMD Radeon RX 7600, I found that while there are certainly some games where it struggles – looking at you, Cyberpunk 2077 – there are plenty of games where you can get more than 60 fps at 1080p. For instance, in Total War: Warhammer 3, the RX 7600 is capable of up to 83 fps at that resolution. That's not as fast as a graphics card that costs twice as much, sure, but at around $250, I can't be mad at it. Plus, this AMD graphics card has 8GB of VRAM, which is more than you'll need for 1080p gaming most of the time. Where the 7600 really shines is just powering popular games without any fuss. You'd be hard pressed to find a modern game that can't run smoothly on this GPU, even if you have to turn down the ray tracing from time to time. I can live with that. 4. MSI GeForce RTX 3050 Gaming XBest Budget GPU Under $200MSI GeForce RTX 3050 Gaming XThe RTX 3050 might be last-gen, but if you want a 1080p graphics card on the cheap, there aren't many better options.Outputx2 HDMI 2.1, x1 DisplayPort 1.4aImpressive dual fan coolingIf you have a keen eye, you've probably realized the GTX 3050 is an old graphics card at this point, being part of the last-generation 3000 series cards. However, Nvidia hasn't really launched a followup yet, and we're two years into the Ada Lovelace generation, so who knows when we're getting a new cheap card from Team Green? Luckily, though, the RTX 3050 is still a great value, easily delivering solid 1080p gaming performance in almost anything you can throw at it. Unlike some of the other cards on this list, you will probably have to compromise on quality settings on some games, especially harder-to-run ones like Cyberpunk 2077 or Horizon: Forbidden West. At the time of writing, this EVGA RTX 3050 is only $179 on Amazon, making it the most affordable way to get into PC gaming right now, short of digging through Craigslist for a used card. Plus, because it is using Nvidia's third-generation Tensor cores, the RTX 3050 still has access to DLSS 2.0, which stretches the value a bit, and makes up for a bit of the lost performance in games that support it. That being said, this isn't a card I'd recommend enabling ray tracing on, even if it has the 'RTX' in its name. It'll run, but it won't be a good experience. Instead, this GPU is best in traditional gaming workloads, and is perfect for esports or indie games. 5. Acer Predator BiFrost Intel Arc A750Best Budget Intel GPU Under $300Acer Predator BiFrost Intel Arc A750A solid 1080p graphics card with plenty of connectivity optionsOutput1 x HDMI; 3 x DisplayPort 2.0Shaky performance now and thenAt around $200, you can bag the Acer Predator BiFrost Intel Arc A750, offering solid 1080p, and even 1440p, performance. While Intel’s XeSS Super Sampling technology is no match for Nvidia’s DLSS technology, it’s still a decent GPU with ray-tracing.Boasting a hybrid cooling and vapor chamber, this GPU remains cool and dissipates heat evenly. However, performance is a little uneven, with some games running like a dream, and others, well, not as good! Still, if you’re building a budget gaming PC, this budget graphics card will make a great addition to your set up.Upcoming Budget GPUsWhile there aren’t any specific budget GPUs coming to the market, you will find as newer GPUs get released, older models will come down in price. Right now, we're in between generations until Nvidia and AMD announce the RTX 5000 and Radeon RX 8000 series, respectively. Rumors have been spinning up about the RTX 5080, some of which suggests it will be extremely expensive. But even if the new flagships are more expensive, a new GPU generation will lower the prices on existing graphics cards – ideally, at least.Luckily, we shouldn't be waiting too long. I expect Nvidia and AMD will have new graphics cards at CES 2025 in January. It's a bit later than the companies typically release their GPUs, but because new graphics cards are nowhere to be found, CES 2025 is just the safest bet. How to Pick the Best Budget GPUChoosing the best budget GPU doesn't have to be overwhelming—it's all about knowing what to look for and finding the right balance between performance and cost. But before deciding which GPU you want to purchase, you’ll first need to think about what you’re using your GPU for.Pay attention to factors like frame rates, resolution capabilities, and compatibility with your existing hardware. A GPU that performs well across these areas is likely a solid choice. If you have a particular game in mind that you want to play, look at the system requirements on your chosen gaming platform, this will give you a good idea of what to look for.As previously mentioned, it’s worth keeping an eye out for sales, discounts, and bundle deals. Prices can fluctuate, so it's worth waiting for a good deal if you're not in a rush. And, if a new GPU has been released, check out some older models as the prices will likely come down. Combining a quality GPU with a good deal can maximize your bang for buck.FAQs on Budget GPUHow Much Should I Budget for a GPU?Less demanding games require less processing power, therefore, you can afford to get a GPU on a budget. For 1080p gaming, you can quite easily get a decent graphics card for anywhere between $200 to $400. However, for 1440p or 4K gaming, prices can extend well beyond $500.What Is the Best Budget GPU for Content Creation?If you're serious about content creation, but can't spring $1,000+ for a RTX 4080 or better, your best bet is a GPU like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. It's got enough CUDA cores to power through most creative workloads via Adobe Premiere or Blender, but also has the 4th-generation Tensor cores to power DLSS, which is increasingly being included in most popular content creation apps.
