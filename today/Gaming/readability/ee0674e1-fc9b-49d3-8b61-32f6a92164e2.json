In fact, the sale that seemed to have won Prime Day this year has shown no signs of slowing down at all. Amazon's buy 2, get 1 free sale on movies, books, and vinyl records is raging on after the final hours of Prime Day 2025.I've been covering Prime Day sales for years and this is the first time I can remember this type of promotion overlapping with the actual sales event days. And despite some actually incredible deals on things like Apple devices and TVs, it was this promotion on physical media that was overall the most popular sale for our audience. I don't know how much longer this promo will be running, but if you're looking to start or add to your physical media collection, it's worth checking this out.What's Included in the Buy 2, Get 1 Free Sale?See All Movies Included in the SaleShop the Full Book Sale3 for 2 Vinyl - Shop the Full SaleI won't dive too far into the specifics of what's included here because we've already done that in a few separate articles. Personally, I'd recommend just diving into the sale yourself and just start searching for whatever you're looking for. Amazon offers the ability to sort by category, author, and genre, so you should be able to narrow it down fairly easily. If you do want some suggestions for what to buy that's included, however, you can check out our top picks for each type of media in the links below:4K Blu-ray MoviesAnime Blu-raysBooksComicsVinylWhen does this sale end?Prime Day ended yesterday and we would have assumed that this sale would have ended with it. Since Amazon has decided to keep it live through the weekend, when will this sale actually end? The short answer is that we don't really know. However, I can make some guesses based on what's going on outside of Amazon right now. There are a few different Prime Day alternative sales running right now that were always set to go beyond what Amazon had to offer. Most notably, the Walmart Sale is continuing on through tomorrow. Because of these prolonged competitor discounts, Amazon appears to be continuing to match prices on things like Apple devices, LEGO sets, and more.So if I had to hazard a guess at when the buy 2, get 1 free sale is going to end, I'd say probably tomorrow. That being said, if you see some movies or books that you like in here I wouldn't recommend hesitating on picking them up. Prime Day is really the last big sales event until Black Friday in November, so now is your best chance to save in 2025 until then.Originally posted: Jul 12, 2025 4:57 pm",
