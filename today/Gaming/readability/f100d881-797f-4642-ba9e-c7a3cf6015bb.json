The proposed sanctions would be aimed at closing off that loophole.An article in the New York Times from last summer demonstrated Ukraine forces using Steam Decks to control gun turrets, as well as unmanned drones on the ground and in the sky. Russia has utilized video game technology in similar ways while unleashing relentless drone attacks on Ukraine's cities and utilities. Military use of video game controllers isn't uncommon, as even US forces utilized them for laser canons and drones.Late last year, Russian propaganda accused Stalker 2 of being used as a recruiting tool for Ukraine's military. There are even said to be plans for Russia to build video game consoles of its own, since the major systems won't be coming back there anytime soon. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?
