  "text": "Ahead of full reveal this weekend. Image credit: Bit Reactor/Respawn Entertainment/EA EA's Star Wars strategy game, confirmed to be in the works back in 2022, has been given a title - Star Wars: Zero Company - and a first bit of artwork ahead of a full reveal this weekend. Star Wars: Zero Company is a collaboration between EA's Respawn Entertainment and developer Bit Reactor, a studio founded in 2022 by veterans of XCOM and Civilization developer Firaxis Games. It was one of three new Star Wars titles announced by EA at the time, the others being a follow-up to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order - Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which released in 2023 - and a Star Wars first-person shooter which has since been cancelled. Little has been heard about Bit Reactor's game in the years since its announcement - although the studio did break its silence to confirm the project had been unaffected by the EA layoffs that accompanied the end of Respawn's shooter - but all that's about to change. EA has taken to social media to share the first official details about the project, calling Star Wars: Zero Company a \"single-player turn-based tactics game\", and sharing a first bit of concept art. The image features a motley crew of unnamed characters (plus one luxuriant moustache) including a Jedi, Mandalorian, and Clone trooper - with the latter suggesting Zero Company is set in the prequel era. That's further supported by the appearance of a battle droid displayed on the holographic device held by our moustachioed friend. Beyond that, there's not much more to report - but that will change this weekend as part of 2025's Star Wars Celebration convention. EA says it'll be sharing a \"world-exclusive first look\" at Zero Company as part of a panel this Saturday, 19th April, at 8.30am. Expect those details to start working their way across the internet shortly after.",
