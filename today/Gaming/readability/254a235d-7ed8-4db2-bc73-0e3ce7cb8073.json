  "text": "And less hassle than building one too! Image credit: MSI / ASUS There’s a strong mix of Prime Day deals and direct offers from HP, Dell, MSI, and others, covering everything from compact gaming laptops to top-tier RTX 5090 desktops. Some builds are priced well below what it would cost to build yourself, and a few include extra savings with codes like LEVELUP20. If you're gaming on the go or setting up a full desktop battlestation, there’s a deal in this guide for just about everyone. I had my eye on this beast when it dropped under $1,700. It’s got the new RTX 5080 mobile chip, which punches harder than last year’s RTX 4090 laptops. The screen is solid at 1080p, but honestly, I’d spring for that OLED upgrade if you're like me and hate washed-out blacks. For the price and raw power, this is a steal right now. This is the kind of build I’d recommend to friends who want 4K gaming without going broke. That 4080 Super does serious work, and the 32GB RAM makes multitasking a dream. The i5 is the only \"eh\" part, but for gaming, it doesn’t hold things back much. And for under $1,500 with a code? Yeah, that’s prime deal material. I was genuinely surprised to see a laptop with an RTX 5090 drop this far in price. It’s not cheap, but this is desktop-tier performance in a 16-inch chassis. I’d recommend the OLED screen upgrade if you’re going all in. It’s an absolute monster for gaming and creative work, and this is the lowest price I’ve seen for specs like these. This is a nicely balanced machine that doesn’t cut corners. The CPU handles heavy loads like a champ, and the RTX 5070 Ti is great for 1440p and even some 4K. It’s the kind of rig I’d grab if I needed a clean upgrade without going full high-end. You get premium cooling and power for a mid-tier price. MSI really packed in a lot here. Ryzen 7, RTX 5070, and a 2TB NVMe SSD? For $1,599, this build could’ve cost more if I sourced parts myself. The RGB setup and airflow are slick too. I don’t own this one, but I seriously considered it while browsing deals this week. This thing is built like a workstation but ready to game. 64GB of RAM is more than I’d ever need, but if you’re streaming, editing, or just hate closing tabs, it’s perfect. I don't own it, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t jealous of whoever snags it at this price. I don’t usually go for $4K rigs, but this one got my attention. The 5090 GPU alone is hard to find, and the fact you’re getting it bundled with Alienware’s best cooling and power setup makes it even better. If money wasn’t an issue, I’d grab this for a 4K/VR setup in a heartbeat. Here’s the “no compromise” setup. Core Ultra 9, RTX 5090, 32GB RAM—it’s everything top-tier. I haven’t tested this personally, but based on the specs and Alienware’s build quality, this is probably the kind of machine I’d use for both high-end gaming and serious AI tools. This is more “grounded luxury.” You get all the premium cooling and PSU features from the Area-51 line, but the RTX 5080 makes it a little more affordable. If you’re gaming at 1440p or 4K without needing that 5090 price hike, this one makes a lot of sense. This one feels like the sweet spot for Alienware builds—plenty of power, RTX 5080, and enough cooling to keep temps low under pressure. It doesn’t go overboard, and for someone like me who prefers something powerful but not too flashy, this checks a lot of boxes. This build hits a nice middle ground. I’ve recommended it to a few folks who want to dip into high-end gaming without going full flagship. The 5070 Ti handles modern games like a champ at 1440p, and the chassis looks slick without being overkill. It’s the kind of system I’d run on the daily. If you’re like me and just want a reliable, cool-looking gaming rig that doesn’t break $1,600, this is it. The RTX 5070 is future-proof enough for 1440p gaming, and Alienware’s build quality holds up. Honestly, I’d grab this over building my own if I wanted to skip the hassle. This feels like a great entry-level rig for someone who doesn’t need crazy power. The 4060 Ti still holds its own, and the price is actually below some DIY builds I checked recently. I wouldn’t use it for 4K, but for 1080p or 1440p on a budget, this would be a solid pickup. This thing is huge, and I love to see it. The 18-inch display makes everything feel cinematic, and the RTX 5080 plus that Core Ultra 9 combo means no compromises. I’ve seen it run AAA games without a hiccup. If you need a desktop replacement that travels, this is on my dream list. Skytech packed in some serious firepower here. I haven’t owned this one personally, but I’ve seen it get rave reviews for performance. The 420mm liquid cooler and 64GB RAM are wild. It’s like they built this thing to destroy framerates and never look back. This one caught my eye for its airflow and clean design. The Ryzen 9 CPU and RTX 5070 combo is excellent for high refresh rate 1440p gaming. I love that it comes with a 360mm liquid cooler—it just feels like someone thought things through when building it. AMD fans, this one’s for you. I haven’t gone all-in on Radeon myself, but I’ve seen this rig chew through 4K games without blinking. Corsair’s case and RGB setup are eye candy too. It looks great on a desk and performs even better. Honestly, I love seeing Corsair throw together a no-nonsense build like this. Ryzen 7 with RTX 5070 means you’re getting buttery-smooth gaming at high settings. I’d be more than happy with this as my main PC, especially with the clean cable work and quiet fans. ASUS didn’t hold back here. I don’t own this one, but I’ve used similar Strix laptops before, and the cooling is top-notch. The 240Hz screen is buttery, and the build just feels premium. Perfect if you want desktop-grade specs without anchoring to a desk. This is what I’d call a performance-focused laptop without going overkill. The RTX 5070 Ti handles modern games effortlessly, and ASUS’s vapor chamber cooling means it stays cool even during marathon sessions. Solid display, fast internals, and very portable. MSI went all-in with this one. The Ultra 9 processor and 2TB of SSD storage are what caught my attention. I don’t own it, but if I wanted a rig that could handle both gaming and video editing without breaking a sweat, this would be high on my list. Plus, that clean design and RGB lighting make it look the part too. I’ve always liked iBUYPOWER’s case aesthetics, and this one’s no different. The Y40 has great airflow and a slick side window, plus it comes with a free keyboard and mouse. With that 7900X and a 5070 Ti, you’re set for 1440p and even some light 4K gaming. Honestly, it’s one of the more complete packages I’ve seen under $2K. I’ve spent a lot of time looking at RTX 5090 rigs, and this one’s easily among the smartest buys. You do need to select a few upgrades and apply a coupon, but once you do, you’re getting one of the most powerful GPUs on the market inside a clean, roomy 45L chassis. HP’s cooling game is strong here too, especially with that 1200W PSU to support the beefy hardware. If I were making a long-term investment in a gaming and productivity powerhouse, this would be hard to beat.",
