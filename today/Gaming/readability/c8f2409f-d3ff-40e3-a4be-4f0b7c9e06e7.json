  "text": "Grow Wild is a cozy sandbox style game where you can discover new plants, find bugs, and watch the world change around you. Discovering plants and building your own biome can be such a fun activity within games, especially when you do not have to be out in the beating sun all day! This game has you finding a beautiful patch of land full of bugs, birds, and plants. Your little friend will guide you as you discover more of what is around you, slowly documenting the different stages of plants and animals throughout the year. When I tried the game at Develop: Brighton, I found that Grow Wild was more of a sandbox nature simulator where you are in an ecosystem that has everything changing – even when you are not playing. One real life day is the same as 100 days in game, which can make some major changes if you just don’t open it up for a bit! You can also spend time crafting the world you want by gathering seeds and re-planting them, as well as using your magnifying glass to find bugs and document the change of season. You do have a little diary that shows the different stages of plants and animals that you have discovered as well as tools that can be purchased from a little shop – a shovel to move around seeds, for example, to help you change the world. Your friend, who also lives on the biome, moves around with you and finds new things. They often give you little quests that you can earn money from as well. The friend in Grow Wild is actually one of the more interesting aspects of it as well. They feel less like a tutorial character (although they will give you a tutorial) and more like another human with the same curiosity as you. As the game progresses, this character will even shout out at you, trying to get your attention when they find something you’ve never seen before. Grow Wild is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
