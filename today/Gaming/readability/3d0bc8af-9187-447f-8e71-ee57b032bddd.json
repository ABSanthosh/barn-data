  "text": "Enter the golden age of piracy with the tactical RPG Flint: Treasure of Oblivion, the first title from studio Savage Level. The game features five chapters that take players from the town of Saint-Malo in France to ancient temples in the jungles of Central America. It features an original narrative inspired by comic books, but also influenced by board games. Based around a system of cards and dice, Flint invites players to explore and collect various item cards, which can be purchased for use in combat. In addition, a system of skills and attributes specific to the character classes (Archetypes) and the ability to perform combos will add variety to the confrontations. The choice of weapons will also be crucial in turn-based battles, which can go as far as pitting teams of up to 15 pirates against one another. But before you do that, assembling and developing your pirate crew will be a core part of Flint: Treasure of Oblivion. Let me explain all you need to know about managing your unruly band of outlaws! Sail the Oceans to Recruit Your Companions For a pirate captain like our hero James Flint, nothing is more important than the support of a solid team. “In Flint: Treasure of Oblivion, the crew is your most precious asset,” says Johan Spielmann, Game Director at Savage Level. Some characters will automatically join you as you progress through the story, like your first mate Billy Bones. With others, however, you will need to explore the environments or use your powers of persuasion to unlock them. In total, no fewer than 35 characters are available to be acquired by the sharpest players. Each will have a given role, just as it would have been on an actual eighteenth-century ship: freebooter, helmsman, messman, cook, and so on. “And for each archetype, there is a unique linked skill,” adds Johan. “For example, the surgeon can heal wounded shipmates; as for the lookout, they can spot a coming attack and disrupt it.” This is why it will be important for players to assemble a crew with as wide a range of skills as possible. Experience and Equipment: Character Development Once you have assembled a pirate crew, there are different ways to develop it in Flint: Treasure of Oblivion. One of them is to share out experience points. A character’s experience can be used to improve their dice rolls, giving them a greater chance of achieving their actions. Experience can also be used to reduce the time it takes for their unique skills to recharge, or to level up their characteristics (health points, damage and agility). “Players will need to decide how to spend their experience,” explains Johan. “It won’t be possible for them to increase everything to the max over the course of one game.” Another way to make your crew more powerful is through equipment. There are nearly 50 unique weapons in Flint: Treasure of Oblivion, including swords, pistols, clubs and spears. You can also find or buy accessories like bandages, grenades and armor. “Each character has three equipment slots,”  Johan continues. “So you could take a pistol, armor and a bandage… or even three grenades, which is an approach that could work!” Equipment allocation cannot be modified while in combat, so it is a decision that needs to be made in advance. A final interesting feature of Flint: Treasure of Oblivion is that winning experience points and buying accessories is directly dependent on gold found over the course of your adventures. “You can choose to use your loot to buy accessories for the whole crew, or share the gold out equally among the pirates in the form of experience,” explained Johan. “We drew inspiration from the life of pirates at the time, where each individual had the same voting power – from lowly sailors right up to the captain.” Manage Your Pirate Crew as You See Fit! As you can see, there is real depth to crew management in Flint: Treasure of Oblivion, with recruitment success linked to how well you explore and make decisions, while you will also find multiple possibilities for levelling up your crewmates. Will you choose to focus on your crew’s skills, or opt for brute force with the most lethal equipment? Find out your favorite strategy in Flint: Treasure of Oblivion, available today on Xbox Series X|S! Experience the golden age of piracy through a strong and original narrative, real-time exploration and turn-based tactical combat in Flint – Treasure of Oblivion. Assisted by his friend Billy Bones and his crew, Captain Flint sets sail for a mysterious treasure. If the call of the unknown galvanizes him, he doesn’t yet suspect this adventure will set him free. Dive into the world of piracy bordering on fantasy of Flint: Treasure of Oblivion. Immerse yourself into a rich well-documented and exciting universe thanks to comic-book styled narration and tactical turn-based combat. – Turn-based tactical combat A good preparation is key: Choose your crew members with unique abilities, obtain new skills, improve your dices. During the tactical phases, use cards to trigger skills and attributes, and influence the fight with dice throws. – Comic-book narrative Enjoy a story that, beyond the usual comic tropes (onomatopoeia, speech bubbles), offers the player original and dynamic comic book panels. – An exploration beyond the oceans Discover a magnificent world, from the french city of Saint-Malo to the exotic landscapes of central America. Visit diverse environments (cities, camps, jungle, caves…) using the power of the Unreal Engine 5. – Historically-inspired piracy world The game faithfully recreates a world of piracy, incorporating historical elements (language, costumes, weapons) making the experience even more immersive.",
