The good news is that you're guaranteed to get an Arcane Embrace just by completing the quick set of quests Eva gives you at the start of the Festival of the Lost to get acclimated to the event--and it's kind of a great one with Trench Barrel and Dual Loader, which you can only get as this reward from Eva.

The good news is that you're guaranteed to get an Arcane Embrace just by completing the quick set of quests Eva gives you at the start of the Festival of the Lost to get acclimated to the event--and it's kind of a great one with Trench Barrel and Dual Loader, which you can only get as this reward from Eva. After that, you can play Haunted Sectors for a chance to get Arcane Embrace rolls as rewards.You can also decrypt Eerie Engrams, earned from the event, for a chance to get the shotgun to drop from them. Eva offers the ability to \"focus\" your Eerie Engrams to get specific rewards instead of a random item from the Festival loot pool, so provided you have the Candy to spend, you can guarantee new Arcane Embraces by visiting her.Arcane EmbraceArcane Embrace God RollsArcane Embrace PvE God RollBarrel: Fluted Barrel or Corkscrew Rifling Fluted Barrel: Stability +5, Handling +15Corkscrew Rifling: +5 Stability, +5 Handling, +5 Reload SpeedMagazine: Tactical Mag Stability +5, Reload Speed +15First Perk: Fourth Time's the Charm Rapidly landing precision shots will return two rounds to the magazine.Second Perk: Surrounded / Precision Instrument Surrounded: This weapon gains improved bonus damage when three or more targets are in close proximity.Precision Instrument: Dealing sustained damage significantly increases precision damage.Masterwork: Handling or Reload SpeedFiring two shots for each pull of the trigger, Arcane Embrace can dish out massive damage very quickly--so the struggle becomes keeping it full of ammo to keep that damage flowing for as long as possible. Focus on increasing your reload speed so you can get the gun loaded quickly, with a secondary emphasis on handling so you can quickly swap to it when needed. Fourth Time's the Charm helps with keeping the gun loaded since you get ammo back for landing precision shots and you can land two hits with each blast. Surrounded and Precision Instrument both do well to add additional damage to the gun. Use Precision Instrument if you're doing well in landing lots of headshots, and Surrounded if you can wade into a group of enemies to do your dirty work. Surrounded offers a more significant damage boost but is generally harder to activate.As mentioned, it's worth noting that the Dual Loader / Trench Barrel roll you get from Eva as a quest reward is also pretty great--and you can't get that version from a random roll, at least right now. It's a pretty solid stand-in from these god roll options.Arcane Embrace PvP God RollBarrel: Smallbore Stability +7, Range +7Magazine: Steady Rounds / Accurized Rounds Steady Rounds: Stability +15, Range -5, Airborne Effectiveness +7Accurized Rounds: +10 RangeFirst Perk: Slideshot Sliding partially reloads this weapon's magazine and temporarily boosts handling and range.Second Perk: Closing Time Improves range, accuracy, and handling as the magazine gets lower.Masterwork: Stability or RangeYou can do solid work in PvP with Arcane Embrace just with its two shots, but it operates like a slug shotgun, which means precision is important. For that reason, stability is a stat you want to lean into, especially because you can get strong boosts to range through other perks. The benefits of Slideshot--increased range and stability, as well as reloading the magazine--are hard to pass up in the Crucible. Closing Time is also great for boosting stats that will help you win fights, including range, although you need to get the magazine down to at least half to trigger it, so keep that in mind when choosing when to reload.
