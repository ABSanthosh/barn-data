  "text": "Yes, I put text chat in the headline, if only because it seemed like such an odd omission back when we picked up the game after the big update in November.  In the age of Discord and easy voice coms I guess text chat isn’t as essential as it was in the 90s or even the early 2000s, but I also don’t always want to be on voice.  So I am happy to see text chat has arrived, even if it is really one of the lesser features of this update. So what else did the Pact of the Flame update bring us? The Pact of the Flame update has arrived Well, I wasn’t far off opening up with a comment about chat because there are a host of in-game social and communications features with the update: Text Chat Enshrouded now supports in-game text chat in multiplayer sessions, no more spelling out your discord name in blocks to make new friends! Hosts or server admins can toggle the feature on or off in the server settings as needed. The feature is set as “off” by default on dedicated servers, so make sure to enable it. Players can individually select other players and mute their messages. Profanity filter settings can be modified through players’ Steam Settings under Friends \u0026 Chat \u003e Chat Filtering. They are on by default on all Steam accounts. A chat log is available on a new “Social” menu page. Voice Chat Voice chat can now be enabled by hosts or server admins. The feature is set as “off” by default, so make sure to enable it. When enabled, there are two modes available: proximity voice chat or global, server-wide voice chat. In the new Social menu page, players can mute other players and adjust their volume. They can also toggle their own microphone on or off. You know who you’ll need it for. In the sound settings, players can mute their microphone, use ‘push-to-talk’ or ‘open microphone’. Additionally, they can adjust their microphone input volume. Social Hub As mentioned above, a new tab has been added to the in-game menu called “Social”. The Social menu displays all players currently playing in the game world, and players can adjust audio and text settings. It is also possible to see everyone’s server permissions and locate their position on the world map. No more endlessly searching for Steve. Emotes A new emote wheel offers emote animations. The wheel is opened by the key or button that was previously mapped to the sitting action (by default, X on keyboard and d-pad down on a controller) which is now integrated into the emote wheel. I like pretty much all of that.  Chat works as expected. My first chat in Enshrouded I am not so concerned with voice chat as we do live in a world where Discord is still a thing that works and hasn’t been wrecked yet, but I guess having a fallback for when Discord goes full Silicon Valley and makes everything worse. Then there is a list of improvements to building: First-person camera for building When using the Construction Hammer, selecting a prop for placement, or equipping one of the new building tools, the camera can now be toggled to 1st person view for an improved building experience, especially in tight spaces. Now you only have yourself to blame for that misplaced chair. Full rotation control for props Props can now be rotated in all axes instead of just the vertical axis. Please note this new functionality is only available for decorative furniture and similar props. Furniture and interactive props like the Flame Altar, beds, benches, chairs, thrones, toilets, and similar can only be rotated around the vertical axis as previously. Building blocks and building shapes can only be rotated by 90° as before. New tool: Overgrowth editing A new building tool has been added to the crafting progression. When equipped, it allows adding and removing various overgrowth materials (such as ivy) to and from building blocks. The new overgrowth tool can be crafted at the farmer NPC with materials from the Revelwood area. New tool: Building block decay A new building tool allows adding or removing ruined block visuals at the edges of building walls. The new decay tool can be crafted at the collector NPC with materials from the Nomad Highlands. Food, drinks and potions placement A new type of prop consisting of plates, boards, and coasters allows the decorative placement of a vast selection of food, drink, and potion items. Finally, dinner tables can have dinner on them! They can be crafted at the farmer NPC when wood planks are unlocked. To go along with this there are also a host of new decor items, including a sofa. I will admit that I haven’t done much beyond some very simple buildings, largely because the UI is a bit to touchy for me.  I guess that goes for all co-op survival titles, but Enshrouded has been more touchy that most to try and get what you want. And I don’t think it is just me.  We have done much less base building than we did in Valheim or Conan Exiles.   Maybe this will improve things. There is also a list of game play improvements: Skills can now be individually reset in the skill tree. Visual parry indications have been added to enemies that didn’t show the parry opportunity before. But we all know some will probably still mess up the timing. A visual parry opportunity indicator has been added to enemy projectiles that can be parried. A new farming animal can now be tamed in the Kindlewastes. Get ready for the Dune Armadillo and its offspring to become friends on the farm! Several bugs and glitches have been addressed for pathfinding and behavioral issues for villagers and farm animals during their daily routine. We will continue to work on improving pathfinding and behavior in upcoming updates as needed. Dodge and blink can now be activated earlier during wand attacks to align the availability of defensive moves with the timings of melee weapons. Those all seem fine.  There is also a host of fixes, including making that first cat taming quest a bit less onerous.  Probably a good thing. I am not going to copy and paste all the changes, and there are a bunch more.  The update linked at the end of the post has the details.  But one thing I will note is that, having logged in, there is also a new quest for the update, available to pick up at your local flame shrine. Celebrate the Pact of the Flame I will move along to the 2025 roadmap that they posted over on Steam as well. The 2025 Roadmap There is a lot going on there including a new zone/biome based in water… which should be a change.  There hasn’t been a lot of water in play in the game so far. Added at the bottom of that chart is a statement that the plan for the game is a 1.0 launch in Spring of 2026, which will include a launch on consoles and a creative mode as well.  For those who won’t touch early access with a 10 foot pole, your time is coming. Finally, as often happens with a big update, there are Twitch drops to be earned between now and February 11th.  Go to a participating live channel on Twitch and you can earn the following rewards: Watch for 1 hour and claim the reward Flame Pact Boots \u0026 Pants Watch for 1 hour 30 minutes and claim the reward Flame Pact Gloves Watch for 2 hours and claim the reward Flame Pact Vest Watch for 3 hours and claim the reward Diamond Wall Emblem Watch for 4 hours and claim the reward Flame Pact Hat [Those rewards seem to be the same as the in-game rewards for the quest above… so two ways to get them I guess.] So there we go.  A big update for Enshrouded and a plan for what is coming.
