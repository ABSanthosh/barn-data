  "description": "I'm not sure if the words cosy and apocalypse are generally ones that go hand in hand together, but Doloc Town is positioning itself as just that. Specifically, it's a quite lovely looking pixel-art farming sim set in a post-apocalypse, and it just launched in early access today. Like in many farming sims before it, there's the usual thing of tending to and growing your crops, cooking them up, fishing, that sort of thing. Where it differs is it's all on a 2D plane, obviously meaning you'll have to think about space quite differently. Read more",

Where it differs is it's all on a 2D plane, obviously meaning you'll have to think about space quite differently. Having a post-apocalyptic setting means you'll have to go off and explore a bit sometimes too. You might find some treasures, some secret relics, occasionally you'll need to fend off robot enemies. It's all just a little bit futuristic, but without the ability to completely rely on technology. I like the look of it a lot, there's a story too and I'm quite into the idea of a 2D farming sim with platforming elements. Not exactly revolutionary, just a combo that looks well done with some really well lit pixel art here. Doloc Town Early Access Launch Trailer Watch on YouTube Speaking of story, the current version of the game will apparently have a bit more than 20 hours of main story to get through, on top of side quests, so it sounds quite beefy. RedSaw Games Studio, the devs behind Doloc Town, say that they plan for the early access period to be no more than a year, with a more detailed roadmap coming soon. Like a lot of Steam games, it has a launch discount on Steam too. Nothing much, just 10%, but if Doloc Town looks like a good time to you, now might be the best time to pick it up.",
