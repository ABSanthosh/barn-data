  "text": "The Site I worry a bit about the theme being used on the blog.  It is the 2012 theme and here it is 2025 and WordPress.com does not have a very good reputation when it comes to supporting their past work.  Back in 2012… and I think as recently as early 2015 possibly… the blog looked like this image. A 2012 headline before the 2012 theme – Also 26 comments? Damn! That is the old Regulus theme, which I quite liked, and which WP.com broke. The blog doesn’t look like that now and, the past era of many comments aside, I am not sure what it will look like in the future.  But there are already signs that the theme is destined for the dustbin of history, not the least of which is that you can no longer choose this theme if you do not already have it applied.  Also, they’ve broken the theme, if only briefly, a few times already. So why not change themes already? Well, mostly because the options WP.com offer kind of suck… at least if you want to keep pretending it is 2008 and you’re writing a gaming blog.  Side bars?  Full text?  Blog rolls? All of that is out as far as WP.com is concerned.  You choice is a clownish pseudo-Minecraft theme and another theme that looks like it could do the job… and then fails.  (Well, the 2016 theme looks like it might fit the bill, but that is only FOUR closer to today than 2012, so I fear it is on the precipice as well.) Everything else is either giant header images and large grids of titles and featured images, or all words and no image support whatsoever. So when WP.com announced they had an AI bot setup that would build you a theme, I was right on board.  Not a fan of AI, I figured an AI would at least TRY to please me.  That is what they are best at, telling people lies they think the people want to hear.  Maybe it would fib its way into something passable. Alas, an AI is only as pliable as the data set you train it on, and WP.com trained it on iant header images and large grids of titles and featured images, or all words and no image support whatsoever as the options.  So no matter what I asked for I would get, to paraphrase Douglas Adams, a theme that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike what I wanted. So the blog abides as it is while I hope for the tide of online trends to turn back to 2008 blogger kitsch.  It could happen! Oh, and WP.com also has a new speed test site.  They say TAGN sucks on mobile, but all the reasons are related to things inherent in the theme and their architecture.  But I pass on desktop.  Also, the speed test is surprisingly slow and tells you what is wrong but doesn’t load the recommendations for fixes, at least as of this writing.  And it fails to even complete most of the time.  They probably don’t want to admit it is all them.  And the site does feel like it is loading slowly of late.  But I think that is just WP.com keeping me on an outdated server most likely. Finally in a last bit of site news, I am going to turn off the Fediverse syndication for the month of May to see what effect it has on links that I paste into Discord.  The Fediverse syndication throws too much text and too many images… and the wrong images… out into the ether and somehow that affects what Discord shows.  I think this signals some sort of Discord/Fediverse integration in the offing… though it might just be that Discord or WP.com… or both… are just bad at integrating. So, while I appreciate that the syndication allows Kevin Brill to leave comments on my blog from Mastodon, which is frankly easier and more reliable than trying to leave them here in the WP.com UI, it is only Kevin Brill who does so. If I turn it off and it has no impact on Discord, I will turn it back on. One Year Ago I was on about how AI was the real April Fools on all of us. I did, however, like CCP’s New Eden Recreational Feed April Fools gag. In my 25th anniversary starting points series for EverQuest I was in North and South Karana, then off to East Karana, then to Highpass hold and Kithicor Forest.  I also collected my level 100 heroic character for the anniversary. There was also the Anashti Sul server coming for EverQuest II. The Elder Scrolls Online reached its 10th anniversary and I was wondering when a game has enough of a following and momentum to sustain itself, to become essentially immortal. We were in Conan Exiles collecting followers… problematic though that might be… while a big update hit that had us… well… sunk into the floor at times.  We also explored the Unnamed City and found a horse.  That got us into mounts… and mods.  We took our horses and rode off to our first dungeon run. I was still pottering around in Valheim, trying to work through the Mistlands.  Eventually I found a mod that simply removed the mist and everything was 100% better… and revealed that the Mistlands are actually quite pretty. With the obstacle of Bobby Kotick gone, Blizzard and NetEase signed an accord to bring WoW back to China. Over in WoW Classic Season of Discovery, season 3 was kicking off.  I hardly remember anything from that.  We also heard that Cataclysm Classic would be landing in May.  Things had been quiet in Wrath for some time. On the other hand, the BlizzCon news was that there would be no 2024 BlizzCon.  But there was also a Friday Bullet Points post about Plunderstorm, Pandaria Remix, the Cataclysm pre-patch, and the end of the WoW Companion app.  The Cataclysm pre-patch landed on April 30th. In EVE Online we were burning up about a trillion ISK in a brawl over a Fortizar in Ahbazon.  Looking at March 2024 destruction, Uitra was at the top of the list. There was also an overview of the coming Equinox expansion for EVE Online. I also picked up Balatro on the PC.  I think it is better on the iPad, but it is still good on PC. I had a Friday bullet points post about progressively more annoying video game business items, including EG7 selling the PlanteSide IP, UbiSoft saying “screw you” to players of The Crew, Mike Ybarra saying devs should get paid in tips, the shady demise of Crop Circle Games, how they were trying to pitch Lars Wingefors, the destroyer of the Embracer Group, as the victim, and how private equity is just destroying everything good in the world. This was followed up by a post about how the Embracer Group was going to reorganize itself out of its self-inflicted crisis. I was wondering about the path to Dune: Part 3 and the books of the series. My Telephone Tales series landed on web banking and mergers and acquisitions. Finally, I wrote about my congressional district, which had an open seat for the first time in 30 years… and how the vote came down to a tie of sorts. Five Years Ago April Fools at Blizzard introduced googly eyes into Overwatch and gave us the traditional WoW patch notes, and that was about it. I took a look back at WoW Tokens five years after their debut.  It also seemed like BlizzCon might not happen, after all, live events were being cancelled everywhere, though Blizzard was looking into alternatives. In Battle for Azeroth I managed to unlock flying. Over in WoW Classic the group was starting prep for Zul’Farrak by visiting the Altar of Zul and Jinha’alor.  That was sketchy enough that we spent a session just leveling up before we made our way down to Gadgetzan to start some quests there, with the expected diversion into Feralas.  I also found a crypt in the Badlands to explore. Everybody being at home due to the pandemic led us to do a Blaugust blogging community event early.  Christened Blapril, we had a prep week, figuring out what to write week, a “getting to know you week” where I wrote about a road trip, listing out our favorite video game series, and then something about motivation. Meanwhile, in WoW Classic news, Holly Longdale was now on the team, phase four was in place, some servers were still over populated, and Blizz was sending out some surveys about how to handle Burning Crusade Classic. Animal Crossing: New Horizons released just in time for the pandemic and seemed to be everybody’s favorite game on the Switch for a while. EVE Online was introducing their second quadrant, Eclipse, and kicking off The Hunt event.  The Hunt also coincided with the introduction of new implants.  There was also a PLEX for Good event for Covid-19, and the capsuleer generosity login campaign, and the Surgical Strike update that nerfed damage resistance modules. CCP also started the ongoing daily login rewards thing, where you got some skill points every 30 days you log in.  The rewards were not great, but skill points are skill points. And the beginning of the campaign season for CSM15 kicked off while the monthly economic report was showing CCP’s mineral drought was raising prices. CCP introduced a new Avatar model on the test server, so I finally got to fly a titan.  The pandemic brought players back to New Eden and the PCU passed the 40K mark for the first time since 2017. Out in the east of null sec I was out with Black Ops dropping on PanFam ratters and miners.  Then there was a road trip north to fight the Conifers. And, finally, I revealed my actual first computer. Ten Years Ago As ever, it was April Fools at Blizzard and elsewhere. Elsewhere, EA was still selling lots of Sims titles, but were cutting online games like Need for Speed: World. In what I thought must be an April Fools joke, Daybreak said they were not going to do any more expansions for EverQuest II.  Instead it was going to be DLC like the Rum Cellar.  A rum idea if ever there was one.  Likewise, though EverQuest was getting a new progression server, it seemed like it was the end of the road for expansions in old Norrath.  Also, that logo, totally not stolen. Of course, why would you even need an official progression server, since Daybreak declared Project 1999 totally legit. And speaking of rum ideas from Daybreak, they were also pushing people off of their forums and on to Reddit.  How were they going to lock threads and delete posts there? CCP was talking about ship skins in EVE Online, in hopes of finally finding the right formula for the Mosaic expansion. In New Eden the war was still going in Delve, including a big fight at ZXB-VC, while the Reavers were doing their work in Querious.  Not only that, but we were also decked out in our spiffy new jackets… well, some of us were.  I was trying to be in both fronts of the war. The Reavers front was the place to be though. The Imperium was declared, with Max Singularity VI as our spiritual leader.  Also, Karma Fleet was launched and Xenuria got in and was a Goon for like ten minutes!  How crazy was that?   I’m sure that will never happen again.  Right? [Narrator: Xenuria has been in KarmaFleet since August of 2015.] Blizzard’s WoW Token idea went live, and the US regional version immediately dropped below the opening price.  It recovered and went up eventually, but it took a while.  They also had a beta for the StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void expansion for which I was not prepared. The instance group was doing Auchindoun and Skyreach in Draenor… after which we were fresh out of dungeons until we all hit 100.  After that I was leveling up some characters and complaining about little things in WoW. Meanwhile, the war of the rings in Lord of the Rings Online was dragging out into its eighth year.  Is this Mordor or Afghanistan? While we’re there, Guild Wars turned ten. And there was this Liebster thing, which feels like it happened a lot further back than it did. Fifteen Years Ago Video games as art?  Did we flay Roger Ebert enough over that? Turbine was purchased by Warner Brothers Home Entertainment.  No word on a Harry Potter MMO as yet, though we did get LEGO Harry Potter. Crimson Leaf Games brought out their rework of Megawars III / Stellar Emperor.  1986 style online game play at a much cheaper price. SOE announced a new subscription plan for EQII, the EQII Passport.  Framed by at least one person as “1/3 the price for 1/10 the access” it surely must have been the right plan for somebody. And speaking of paying for games, I wondered where Facebook credits were headed.  They seemed like a bad deal for games relative to paying companies like Zynga directly.  Despite speculation that they would be the ONLY currency allowed on Facebook, that has still not to come to pass. And while talking about Facebook games, I couldn’t bring myself to play Mafia Wars, so I secured a deposition about the game from a friend. In EVE Online somebody was trying to blackmail Gaff’s corp.  This was an out of game threat though. Blizzard introduced the Celestial Steed (aka the sparkle pony or the greed steed) to the Blizzard Store.  Blog reactions were mixed, but the queue to buy the mount on day one got 140,000 transactions deep.  That is a lot of horsies, which meant they were everywhere in the game pretty soon.  The Lil’ XT companion pet that was introduced at the same time also made its own mark on the world… until Blizzard toned it down. The instance group was in WoW still, playing horde characters on the Lightninghoof RP-PvP server.  We we working on Dire Maul, attempting a successful tribute run after having run around Blackrock Depths. Since the instance group was getting close to finishing up the classic WoW dungeon and wondering if we should press through the Burning Crusade content (as short as it passes), we started exploring other games as possible alternatives.  This lead us to try out Runes of Magic for a bit. There was April Fool’s.  I had a contest while Blizzard went over the top, as used to be the case. And, finally, the cruelest 2010 April Fool’s tease, the iPad arcade stand.  On the bright side, while it started as a tease, it ended up becoming a real thing. Twenty Years Ago Guild Wars launched, with ArenaNet going with a “buy the box, play for free” business model for its new MMO, though they wouldn’t call it and MMO at the time.  And maybe it wasn’t one at the time, but now anything online with a lobby is an MMO.  I own the original box and one of the expansions, but would be surprised if I played even 10 hours total.  It was never quite my thing, and not just because you couldn’t jump. Twenty-Five Years Ago The first expansion for EverQuest, The Ruins of Kunark, launches.  We got ten more levels, new races, and a new continent to explore. Nintendo sold its 100 millionth GameBoy/GameBoy Color.  That total eventually passes 118 million units sold, only tapering off with the arrival of the GameBoy Advance a year later. Sony announced that the PlayStation 2, which launched the month before, was so sophisticated that the Ministry of Trade would place export controls on it as it could be used for military applications. Fifty Years Ago Monty Python and the Holy Grail was released and we’ve not been the same since.  My grandmother took 10 year old me to see this and… I’ve thought a lot about the Castle Anthrax scene since.

LOTRO – 50.01% Pokemon Go – 26.03% Balatro – 13.04% Enshrouded – 5.42% EVE Online – 5.23% WoW Classic – 0.27% Still, I obviously found time for LOTRO once we got home. Balatro I did, in fact, play some Balatro on my iPad.  I didn’t manage anything amazing beyond unlocking a couple more decks.  I haven’t managed to beat the black stakes level yet with any decks, but I am working on it.  And, after I did the search terms bit above, I figured I should at least give it a passing mention down here.  Also, I did play quite a bit on the plane. Enshrouded Kind of a quiet month for the group in Enshrouded. having “finished” what early access had to offer.  But then we re-rolled with a fresh server, as I noted yesterday. EVE Online I did undock.  I actually made it on five fleets, one of which wrecked an NCDot Vagabond fleet that was hitting one of our Ansiblexes.  Homeland defense is a thing.  Otherwise I tended my PI and collected my login rewards. Lord of the Rings Online Clearly my number one game this month, as it was last month.  I am now well beyond where ever my past peak was.  As I mentioned, I think I left off somewhere around 63 in Mirkwood during some past venture.  Now I am closing in on 80 and will maybe land in Rohan, some day. Pokemon Go Played a lot of this on Kauai, as mentioned above.  There was a bit of planning for the level 48 tasks, which includes a requirement to earn 35 platinum medals.  I have 21 currently.  But I only need to spin ~100 more unique Pokestops for another, thanks to spinning every one I could find on the island, including the gym at the trail head at the top of Waimea Canyon State Park. Level: 47 – 88% of the way to 48 Task Status – Done! 10 souvenirs from buddy – 10/10 Earn 300 hearts with your buddy – 300/300 Walk 200km with your buddy – 200/200 Walk 25km a week for eight weeks – 8/8 Pokedex status: 878 (+7) caught out of 1,008 in the Pokedex Pokemon I want: Carnivine, a missing Sinnoh entry Current buddy: Tinkatuff Coming Up EVE Fanfest starts Friday, so I will probably have something to write about that.  Also, capsuleer day… the actual anniversary date, not this month long login reward event… is coming up this weekend.  There will probably be something about the summer expansion to fuss about.  And, if not, there is always the MER.  If nothing else, in a call back to that image at the top, it is now easy to argue that PLEX is the economy, at least for the most part.  It dwarfs everything else. EverQuest is going to launch their expanded start special server.  All Access players only.  But it must be a big deal as my meager post about it was my most popular this month. I will also be carrying on in LOTRO and the group will be hitting Enshrouded, and who knows, maybe we’ll hear something about WoW Classic Mists of Pandaria.  It could happen.  It is only three or so months away.",

month, if only because I was gone for the first week.  We were on Kauai.  I’ve been to Maui a couple dozen times… I have family there… but our first visit to Kauai.  Lots of chickens on Kauai.  Which has nothing to do with anything, save for the fact that these numbers reflect me not being at my PC for a week… and playing a lot of \u003cem\u003ePokemon Go\u003c/em\u003e on

anything amazing beyond unlocking a couple more decks.  I haven’t managed to beat the black stakes level yet with any decks, but I am working on it.  And, after I did the search terms bit above, I figured I should at least give it a passing mention down here.  Also, I did play quite a bit on the plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnshrouded\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKind of a quiet month for the group in \u003cem\u003eEnshrouded\u003c/em\u003e. having

off somewhere around 63 in Mirkwood during some past venture.  Now I am closing in on 80 and will maybe land in Rohan, some day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePokemon

platinum medals.  I have 21 currently.  But I only need to spin ~100 more unique Pokestops for another, thanks to spinning every one I could find on the island, including the gym at the trail head at

starts Friday, so I will probably have something to write about that.  Also, capsuleer day… the actual anniversary date, not this month long login reward event… is coming up this weekend.  There will probably be something about the summer expansion to fuss about.  And, if not, there is always the MER.  If nothing else, in a call back to that image at the top, it is now easy to argue that \u003ca
