Poker and Sorcery is a turn based single player RPG heavily inspired by an old game called Sword \u0026 Poker. **This game can be played for free with one of the characters. Players have the option to purchase the full game, which unlocks the remaining characters.** Life in the countryside is upended when monsters start pouring out from an old tower in the mountains. You decide to travel to the tower to investigate. Find new weapons, collect artifacts and learn new skills along the way. FEATURES - Fight monsters by playing poker hands on a grid - the better the poker hand, the more damage you do - Choose between four different classes: Hunter, warrior, mage and rogue, each with different starting skills and weapon proficiencies - Find over 30 different weapons that inflict various status effects depending on the poker hand played - Find over 30 different artifacts that help you in various ways - Made with phones in mind: Short, bite-sized battles in portrait mode to play on the go - Fully playable offline TouchArcade Rating:Unrated Compatibility:HD Universal L.Lawliet and sebgo like this. Seems like bad timing with Balatro coming today? Never played Balatro before but it looks very similar to this. elcrazy and AltsKev like this. Loos like a Sword and Poker remake! With added Rogue like features. I loved sword and poker 1 and 2 untill the developer removed them from iOS. Than they made a 3rd one that was free to play, which was eventually also removed. Balatro’s out too! Seems like I am going to be busy playing both poker games for a while. If I can pull myself away from Balatro. : ) sebgo and L.Lawliet like this. Oooo this could be good. Sword and Poker WAS one of my favorite card games of all time on iOS. I sunk so many happy hours into it. When it stopped working I was heartbroken. If this plays the same I will be very happy. This releasing at the same time as Balatro is interesting. I'll have to make time for them both heh The game is good! I wish the combat attacks/ effects had more weight to them. They seem a little too lite in my opinion. Also, I think I remember Sword and poker having some branching maps, risk reward paths, chests with loot. That would be cool to see in a future update. Seems to need a little more work. Got stuck in a situation where all the tiles were filled and it wouldn’t start a new board. Great game otherwise though so hopefully they put in a fix for that. Frustrated with this. Used a joker to make a straight and it gave me a three of a kind which scored less. Definitely isn’t bug free unfortunately, so shelved until issues are fixed. Patreon Bronze I pressed on with it, because I wanted to see the teased alternative ending or additional stage behind the Act 3 boss on Hard. Got him down to 5 HP. Can’t bring myself to try again. The gameplay’s not rich enough. Maybe if the status effect tactics had better usability. Share This Page",
