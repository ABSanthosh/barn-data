Hot on the heels of the reveal of Absolute Evil, DC is shedding light on DC K.O., the publisher's next big crossover event.Overseen by Absolute Batman writer Scott Snyder and Superman writer Joshua Williamson and building on the foundation of 2024's DC All In, DC K.O. explores what happens when the fate of the entire DC Universe hinges on a Mortal Kombat-style death tournament. 36 fighters will enter the tournament, with only one standing the chance of rising through the ranks and building up enough Omega Energy to challenge Darkseid himself. DC K.O. Crossover Cover Art Gallery“DC K.O. is a knock-down, drag-out fight between all your favorite DC Super Heroes in a cosmic tournament to save the universe from Darkseid,” said Snyder in DC's press release. “Darkseid has evolved into something bigger and stronger than ever.” “He’s destroyed the future,” added Williamson. “There’s no future for the DC Universe because of what he’s done—the heroes’ only shot is to stop him in the present.”DC is teasing that readers will be greatly surprised at which heroes enter the tournament and, especially, which ones make it through the early battles. However, the core of DC K.O. is built around Superman.“Metal was a Batman story, Death Metal was a Wonder Woman story—and DC K.O. is a Superman story,” said Williamson. “I wanted to tell a story about Superman looking into his own heart of darkness,” said Snyder. “It’s a very personal story wrapped in nine layers of candy exploding in your face.” The core, five-issue DC K.O. miniseries will be written by Snyder and illustrated by Javi Fernández (Batman \u0026 Robin). Williamson, meanwhile, will write several tie-in books spinning out of the main series. Other ongoing DC books like Justice League Unlimited and Titans will also tie into DC K.O. DC K.O. kicks off with the prologue issue Justice League: The Omega Act #1 on October 1, 2025, followed by DC K.O. #1 on October 8.For more on Snyder's current DC work, find out what happens when Absolute Batman meets Absolute Joker.Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.
