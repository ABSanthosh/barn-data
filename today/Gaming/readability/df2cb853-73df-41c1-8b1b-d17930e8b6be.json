In perhaps one of the least interesting outcomes of all time, all four top seeds made it to the semi-finals. So, if you happened to base your entire bracket on the number 1, congratulations! With the rest of the tournament playing out over the next couple of days, it might not be worth picking up a new subscription or cable plan. But that shouldn’t mean you have to miss out on the fun. With the magic of free trials, here’s how you can watch the March Madness Final Four games online for free. How to Watch the Final Four Games for FreeParamount+The rest of the Men’s March Madness tournament takes place today and Monday. That means you only need three days of a streaming service to watch the semi-finals and the National Championship. All three games will be airing live on CBS and simultaneously streamed on Paramount+, which happens to offer a 7-day free trial. In other words, if you sign up for Paramount+ right now, you can watch the Final Four games as well as the National Championship before your trial ends. Alternatively, you could use an HDTV antenna to watch the games live via your local CBS channel.Other Free Trials That Let You Watch March MadnessParamount may have the longest free trial (and cheapest ongoing subscription cost if you forget to cancel it), but plenty more live TV subscriptions include CBS. Services like Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream might make sense for anyone who wants ongoing sports coverage, including NBA livestreams.March Madness Final Four Game ScheduleThere's only three games left in the March Madness tournament, all of which are being played in San Antonio at the Alamodome. See the full tournament schedule at the NCAA website. Final Four (Semi-Finals) - Saturday, April 5(1) Florida vs. (1) Auburn - 6:09pm (CBS, Paramount+)(1) Duke vs. (1) Houston - 8:49pm (CBS, Paramount+)National Championship - Monday, April 7 TBA - 8:50pm (CBS, Paramount+) All Top Seeds, But a Range of Experience in the Final FourEvery one of these top-seeded teams has something to prove. This is Duke's first time reaching the Final Four since Coach K retired back in 2022, and the Blue Devils lead predictions for taking the crown. Florida won back-to-back championships in 2006 and 2007, though the last time they made it to the Final Four was in 2014. Meanwhile, this is only Auburn's second time ever making it to this stage. Houston actually holds the record for the most Final Four appearances without any Championship wins (seven total), most recently reaching the semi-finals in 2021.
