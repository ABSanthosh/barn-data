  "text": "Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Need for Speed, and The Stanley Parable.Sony has announced the PlayStation Plus monthly games for January 2025 will be Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered, and The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe.As detailed on PlayStation.Blog, all three of these games will be available on January 7 for PlayStation Plus members, with Suicide Squad arriving on PS5, Need for Speed racing to PS4, and Stanley Parable dropping on PS5 and PS4.The big addition here is Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, especially after developer Rocksteady just recently confirmed it will be pulling the plug on new content after Season 4 arrives this month. Despite that, there is a lot to look forward to, including a playable Deathstroke, an offline mode, and all the previous seasonal content. In our Suicide Squad; Kill the Justice League review, we said it is \"a repetitive and bland looter-shooter that, despite an engaging story, never stays fun for long enough.\"Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered is the updated 2020 version of the game that was first released in 2010. This remastered edition has enhanced visuals, cross-platform multiplayer, asynchronous competition powered by Autolog, all the DLC, and more.In our Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered review, we said that, while it isn't the \"most exciting remaster,\" Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered is \"still one of the best modern arcade racers around - and now it looks even better.\"Lastly, The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is the \"expanded re-imagining\" of 2013's The Stanley Parable, complete with new content, choices, and secrets. There is also improved visuals, accessibility features, and much more.In our The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe review, we said, \"The Stanley Parable still holds up a decade later, and the Ultra Deluxe version essentially adds a whole new game’s worth of additional content to stumble upon.\"For more, check out December's PlayStation Plus monthly games before they go away on January 6 and why Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was one of our biggest disappointments of 2024.Have a tip for us?
