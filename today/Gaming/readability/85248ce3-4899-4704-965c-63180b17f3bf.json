  "text": "Robo Catcher Zero takes players to a district filled with broken machines and hidden robot buddies for you to locate and awaken. Finder’s been tasked with wrangling up friendly robots that have tucked themselves into all sorts of places throughout the Amp220Ω district. The reason for why these machines are all so shy isn’t made clear in the current demo of the game, but that’s fine. I don’t need a lot of good reasons to find cute metal buddies besides the fact that they’re adorable. And this tiny slice of demo has quite a few cute robots to scrounge up. Finding the robots takes more than just finding their hiding spots. The robots don’t seem too keen on being discovered, so you have to play a short minigame when you find one. A small ball-like pod will roll around the screen and you will need to catch it with your mouse (looking like a catcher’s mitt) a few times in order to collect your new pal. It’s not especially challenging most of the time (other than the fact that some of the pods move around in a hurry), but it does add a tiny bit of action to gathering the robots. And once you have a few, you can have them follow you around as you explore the rest of the world. Robo Catcher Zero seems to be focused on creating a relaxed experience in exploring its decayed mechanical landscapes, simply having you putter around and find more robots. There is a story that appears to be taking shape as you find more machines, though, the world humming back to life as your party grows. I’m curious to see where the full version will take this story and why all of these robots started hiding. Robo Catcher Zero is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can grab a demo or add it to your wishlist on Steam.
