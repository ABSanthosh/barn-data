That is a lot of walking That is not The Heroes Journey I am writing about.  There is also an EQemu based server that runs under the name The Heroes Journey (THJ going forward) that Daybreak is suing in an attempt to shut it down. There is a whole story over at Massively OP that sums up the details known at this time.  The case got some attention up front due to Daybreak attempting to seal the case from public scrutiny and asking for a temporary restraining order in advance of any judgement.  Daybreak failed on both points, but the case against THJ looks pretty strong despite the company not getting its every wish granted off the bat. I say that because multiple sources indicate that THJ has a cash shop that essentially sells in-game benefits.  Those are then not donations but simple commerce and, if true, THJ is just a business trying to make money using Daybreak owned assets.  Some may remember the last decade and Blizzard going after WoW emulators and having success with those that were selling advantage.  If this is proven to be the case for THJ then I have little doubt that Daybreak will see similar success. The wrinkle comes with THJ attempting to cloak itself in the guise of “game preservation.” This does not make me happy.  Not one bit. This is because the concept of “game preservation” not only comes into conflict with copyright and trademark laws, so companies are often fully withing their legal rights to stop somebody from using the trade names and assets, but also dives into the whole “what does game preservation even mean?” question. The latter runs the gamut between good faith actors who want to make sure that old titles remain available and accessible to a very entitled gamer view that, having paid for a game, one should be able to play any specific version or variation of a title whether or not the company is still around or the game itself is still being sold and supported. This was very much the conflict between emulators, who were trying to recreate the pre-Cataclysm era of World of Warcraft, and Blizzard, which was still running and supporting and very much dependent on subscription revenue from the game.  This eventually led to WoW Classic back in 2019, which made many, but not all, happy.  In a completely predictable turn of events I file under the heading “what is classic anyway” the “classic” chosen wasn’t the exact “classic” that a few vocal people wanted.  There is always somebody who wants day one classic or Captain Placeholder classic or third beta when everything was the best classic. Which brings us around to EverQuest, which has also had the “not classic enough” problems with its classic/retro/progression servers… which is saying something, as the team has been attempting in its way to serve that old school, fresh start need since 2006.  But it is hard to go back with a title that is always moving forward.  Over on the EverQuest II side of the house they made a whole “origins” platform to help fill that need. But Daybreak has recognized the imperfection of their offerings and had, back in 2015, recognized and authorized Project 1999, a non-profit with the goal of creating early EverQuest as it was back in the day. Project 1999 is video game preservation… at least for a specific, early version of the game to which players once had access.  Whether or not gamers have any real right to demand access to a specific version of an otherwise active and support title remains in dispute. Which brings me around to THJ and their claim to preservation.  If you go to their site they make a pretty big deal about all the ways that their server is different than EverQuest, original, current, or any stage in between. Some of the ways that THJ differs from EverQuest They are, in clear and indisputable fact, offering up a version of EverQuest that no player of the official game ever had access to at any point during the history of the game.  This is the selling point of the server. THJ is not preserving anything.  THJ is making something new.  This is reflected in the only cogent argument I have seen in defense of THJ, which is that it is offering something that Daybreak does not… but also something it has never offered. Now, one of the aspects of running an EQemu is that you can change the rules.  You can absolutely offer a different experience.  But that doesn’t make what you’ve done defensible in court if Daybreak comes looking for you. To sum up: THJ is very likely going to lose in court because they turned the server from a hobby project to a business, and once you start doing that you are toast.  This has happened enough times that you would think people would learn… but there is always somebody. Their only real defense, which is that of “game preservation,” falls apart because there was never a version of the game like THJ so the only thing being preserved is THJ. Finally, I am not happy that Daybreak is going go upset somebody’s fun and take the project offline.  But the people operating THJ went too far and this is the entirely predictable outcome.  If they had held back we wouldn’t be having this conversation.
