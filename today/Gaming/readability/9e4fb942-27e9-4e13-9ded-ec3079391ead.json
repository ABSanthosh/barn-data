  "text": "While the holiday period is often considered a time for rest and reflection, we know what it’s really about – finally having time to play some excellent video games. And what better match for the season than cozy games – titles built for relaxation, lacking in stress, but just as inventive as their action-oriented cousins.  Whether the cold weather has you peeking into a shameful backlog or browsing the Xbox storefront for something new, we’ve got a mighty fine selection of tried and tested titles that are great to cozy on up with – divided into categories to ensure you find the exact right fit for your mood. So, grab yourself a hot drink in your favourite oversized mug, fetch a big ol’ blanket, and dive on in here.  Fun on the Farm Farming sims are effectively the ancestral home of cozy gaming, offering respite in peaceful worlds where we can grow produce, hangout with friends, and adventure to our heart’s content.

Take life as it comes in this relaxing simulator full of charm.  Comfy, Cozy Puzzles   If the farm life isn’t quite for you, perhaps this selection of lovely puzzle games will sate your interest. We’re not talking brain busters here, just cozy exploration and peaceful, satisfying puzzling that you can take at your own pace, all bundled up in gorgeous art styles.  Botany Manor Cloud, Console, and PC This quaint puzzle game sees places you in the wellington boots of Arabella Greene, a retired botanist on a quest to restore the gardens of her stately home.
