  "text": "Image credit: Sony This evening, Sony and developer Sucker Punch gave us all a closer look at Ghost of Yōtei, as part of a dedicated State of Play. Along with an overview of gameplay, different modes, weapons and more, the team also revealed its custom PS5 and DualSense controllers, which are coming with the newly announced Ghost of Yōtei Limited Edition Bundles. Ghost of Yōtei - Limited Edition PS5 Bundles \u0026 Accessories Ghost of Yōtei - Limited Edition PS5 Bundles \u0026 Accessories. Watch on YouTube The limited edition designs are \"rooted in traditional Japanese art\", the Ghost of Yōtei team said. There are two designs to choose from: The PS5 Console - Ghost of Yōtei Gold Limited Edition Bundle and the PS5 Console - Ghost of Yōtei Black Limited Edition Bundle. The Gold bundle features, as the name suggests, gold detailing running across the hardware inspired by kintsugi, \"a traditional process to repair broken ceramics with lacquer and gold\". PlayStation states this design mirrors the personal \"journey of healing and resilience\" of Ghost of Yōtei's lead Atsu, while also \"symbolising beauty in imperfection\". Image credit: Sony The PS5 Console - Ghost of Yōtei Black Limited Edition Bundle, meanwhile, takes its inspiration coming from Sumi-e. This is another traditional Japanese art form, which uses black ink on plaintings. \"Expressing the landmarks of Ezo through bold black brush strokes, this design captures the essence of the land's beauty and mystery, while echoing Atsu's inner struggle and journey towards redemption,\" PlayStation said. Image credit: Sony Both of the above Ghost of Yōtei PS5 bundles come with a matching DualSense wireless controller. A silhouette of Atsu adorns the touchpad. \"Our inspiration for this design came straight from one of the core aspects within the game: a deep focus on exploration,\" Sucker Punch creative director Jason Connel said. \"This includes the hand-drawn icons Atsu marks on her map, a kintsugi-style effect pulled from her Ghost mask, and brushstrokes reminiscent of her Sumi-e paintings. \"The towering Mount Yōtei is included at the center of the console design to pull it all together, and Atsu is spotlighted on the DualSense controller. Each of these elements were thoughtfully woven into both the console and controller designs.\" As well as these bundles, those with a PS5 Slim or PS5 Pro will be able to purchase Console Covers. The DualSenses will both also be available as a standalone purchase. This hardware is set for release on the same day as Ghost of Yōtei itself: 2nd October. You can find further information on the PlayStation Blog. Image credit: Sucker Punch Ghost of Yōtei will focus on Atsu and her quest for vengeance. She is hunting down a gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six, you see. \"They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived,\" Sucker Punch teased earlier this year. \"She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito.\"",
