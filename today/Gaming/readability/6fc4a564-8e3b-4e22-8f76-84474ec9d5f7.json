  "text": "I mentioned the Advanced Access launch of Civilization VII at our team standup last week… we’re all nerds there, it seems like a safe space for that sort of thing… and one of the young devs on the team asked me who Sid Meier was, with a hint of “is that even a real person?” in their voice. What do you even say at that point?  Then again, I only mentioned Civ VII and did not called it “Sid Meier’s Civilization VII” so I guess he knew the name at least… and he certainly knew about the Civilization series. Civilization VII Anyway, today is the day.  We’re past the Advanced Access stage of the game launch and now people who opted to pay a mere $70 for the game are able to join in. So how’s it going?  The couple of people I know who are really into such titles are digging in and enjoying it, or so they report.  I always try to allow for a bit of “I spent $130 on a video game so of course I like it!” in that, but it has kept them engaged… and they are not alone.  SteamDB put the peak concurrent player count for the first weekend at just past the 66K mark, and that is only people with Advanced Access.  I suspect that number will be passed today… and that is just on Steam on the PC.  The game is landing on Linux, MacOS, PlayStation, XBox, and even the Nintendo Switch. That said, the Advanced Access crowd didn’t seem 100% on board after the first weekend.  Over on Steam yesterday, before the general release, the user reviews were “mixed” with just 51% reporting favorable. Steam Reviews as of Yesterday Morning That is in some contrast to the professional review which, while not exactly glowing, averaged out to over 80% if aggregation like Metacritic is to be trusted. Metacritic puts it at 81… pretty good for a PC game There were some outliers, such as EuroGamer, which gave it just 2 out of 5 stars.  (And its ranking, while not bad for a PC title, is a bit low relative to some past entries, where Civ II and Civ IV are the high score champs. A review of the main line series is here if you are interested.)  But those reviews were still mostly complimentary and favorable in tone. Meanwhile, a few of the Steam reviews are angry.  The voting responses bubbled one up to the top of the list that included this: CIV 7 is a betrayal of Sid Meier’s vision for CIv and it deeply depresses me to write this negative review. It’s a broken game for reasons other reviewers have expressed far better than I have–but the bitter truth of it is is that it’s unfinished, unbalanced and unserious as a CIV game. More of them complain about a number of technical and general usability issues.  Firaxis devs have been responding to some of those, indicating that the team is working on making things better, referencing a blog post about their current priorities. Does this mean we have another SimCity fiasco on our hands, where video game outlets lavished the game with praise based on review copies, only to have users in revolt over the quality of the game? I do not think so.  I have written here more than a few times that just about every Civilization series launch has had, in my direct experience, a bunch of problems on day one.  Sometimes it was more a matter of needing another generation of CPUs to show up to be able to handle the game… but at other times, there were technical problems, the latter becoming a bit more common as the series progressed. Same as it ever was… me at the Civ V launch And, as I wrote last week, I am not keen on the business model.  I acknowledge that video game prices haven’t risen with the price of many other things and that, short of Grand Theft Auto VI setting a new price metric for new games… and the industry is so hoping for that… studios have to find other ways to generate revenue.  (I am going to link to that State of Video Games in 2025 presentation just one more time here.)  Selling civs and leaders has been a thing for a couple of generations… but when they start talking about selling wonders as upgrades… hrmm.  So I have some mixed feelings on that front. You might legitimately ask at this point why I am bringing all of this up?  Do I have an axe to grind?  Have I gone against Sid Meier and the Civ series?  Am I looking to tarnish the game through my petty words? I am going to say “no” to that and direct you to the About page.  I do not waste my time writing about games I do not like.  I don’t have the time, the energy, or the inclination.  Okay, maybe I stir the pot about a title I don’t play now and then… but there is usually some root affinity to the title, or what it once was or what it could have been.  I am pretty sure I shit all over the Facebook version of Civilization… yes, yes I did… that came and went pretty quickly, as an example.  But there was my investment in the series.  I wanted it to be good. And that is the case here.  I have been invested in the Civ series since the original washed up on the store shelves at ComputerWare back in 1991 and I grabbed a copy.  I have probably invested more hours in the series than any single player game ever, which is saying something given the rather obsessive amount of time I spent with video games in my youth. Given that, the launch of a new title in the series is a pretty big deal to me.  I have liked all the entries in the series, but I have sure bought and played them all, and I will no doubt do the same here.  That I am not buying in today does not diminish my need to mark the occasion and not the state of the story here on the big day.  A lot of titles have rough starts and carry on. I am certainly willing to concede that my choice to wait for a later date to purchase the game was based mostly on my expectation that there will be a period of getting things right.  I have lived the launch routine before.  I don’t have the patience for it now.  I’ll wait until things settle. I am not calling you out if you’re buying it today… or if you bought a version that got you in last week.  You do you.  I’ll join you at some point. So welcome to the day, the dawning of a new Civilization title.  We shall see where it goes from here.",

\u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/02/05/the-civilization-vii-age-has-begun-with-a-2025-roadmap-to-back-it-up/\"\u003eas I wrote last week\u003c/a\u003e, I am not keen on the business model.  I acknowledge that video game prices haven’t risen with the price of many other things and that, short of Grand Theft Auto VI setting a new price metric for new games… and the industry is so hoping for that… studios have to find other ways to generate revenue.  (I am going to link to that \u003ca href=\"https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025\"\u003eState of Video Games in 2025 presentation\u003c/a\u003e just one more time here.)  Selling civs and leaders has been a thing for a couple of generations… but when they start talking about selling wonders as upgrades… hrmm.  So I have some mixed feelings on that front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might legitimately ask at this point why I am bringing all of this up?  Do I have an axe to grind?  Have I gone against Sid Meier and the Civ series?  Am I looking to tarnish the game through my petty words?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am going to say “no” to that and direct you to the About page.  I do not waste my time writing about games I do not like.  I don’t have the time, the energy, or the inclination.  Okay, maybe I stir the pot about a title I don’t play now and then… but there is usually some root affinity to the title, or what it once was or what it could have been.  I am pretty sure I shit all over the Facebook version of \u003cem\u003eCivilization…\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/theyre-dogs-and-theyre-playing-at-being-cultured/\"\u003eyes, yes I did\u003c/a\u003e… that came and went pretty quickly, as an example.  But there was my investment in the series.  I wanted it to be good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that is the case here.  I have been invested in the \u003cem\u003eCiv\u003c/em\u003e series since the original washed up on the store shelves at ComputerWare back in 1991 and I grabbed a copy.  I have probably invested more hours in the series than any single player game ever, which is saying something given the rather obsessive amount of time I spent with video games in my youth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven that, the launch of a new title in the series is a pretty big deal to me.  I have liked all the entries in the series, but I have sure bought and played them all, and I will no doubt do the same here.  That I am not buying in today does not diminish my need to mark the occasion and not the state of the story here on the big day.  A lot of titles have rough starts and carry on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am certainly willing to concede that my choice to wait for a later date to purchase the game was based mostly on my expectation that there will be a period of getting things right.  I have lived the launch routine before.  I don’t have the patience for it now.  I’ll wait until things settle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not calling you out if you’re buying it today… or if you bought a version that got you in last week.  You do you.  I’ll join you at some point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo welcome to the day, the dawning of a new \u003cem\u003eCivilization\u003c/em\u003e title.  We shall see where it goes from here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
