New for 2025 – Fangbreak As announced back in the April Producer’s letter, this is an “expanded start” server, which means it kicks off with with more than just the day one 1999 content unlocked. Expanded Start  It’s been a request for some years where some players wanted to have more expansions unlocked from the start (here’s looking at you players that main Iksar and Vah Shir). With this year’s expanded start, players will have access to more player races, locations, and tons more content with oodles of loot to obtain right from the start. Start with Ruins of Kunark, Scars of Velious, and Shadows of Luclin unlocked and level-locked to level 50. Enjoy access to a more varied level 50 experience with Iksar and Vah Shir available on launch day! Spend time experiencing everything our first 3 expansions have to offer before the level cap is increased to 60 at the following cadence: The Shadows of Luclin unlocks at Level 50 at Launch The Shadows of Luclin continues at Level 51 on July 24, 2025 The Shadows of Luclin continues at Level 55 on September 18, 2025 The Shadows of Luclin continues at Level 60 on November 13, 2025 Slow Initial Unlocks  The fact is the population on every progression server declines as more and more expansions unlock. So, to keep a healthy server population for a longer period, we are extending the unlock time within some of the early expansions. We hope the slower initial progression leads to a longer, healthier progression server over the lifespan of the server. Resource Hunter  The concept behind this ruleset is to expand the experience of hot zones to a new daily method. We hope that it will not only bring the thrill of finding new special areas but also bring the community together in the hunt. The Resource Hunter ruleset of random daily bonuses should not only encourage playing in a variety of zones and exploring more of Norrath but also make it more rewarding to roam in different zones than you might normally on a TLP. Encounter Locking  While it initially had some controversy, looking at the lifespan of Oakwynd it has been seen as a net good for the server. We received enough feedback and analyzed the data, and it appears to have ultimately benefited the server enough to try it again. Legacy Characters We’re big fans of this ruleset. We tried it and we liked it overall, so we’re doing it again. It will be interesting to see how it works in parallel with the Alternate Personas feature. True Box  This server starts with Restricted True Box. Only two computers may be run by one person at the same time while connected to Fangbreaker. Boxing any more than two accounts at the same time will result in action being taken against your account. True Box is removed when the Expanded Start period ends. On Fangbreaker, Expanded Start ends when Planes of Power unlocks. After raising the level cap incrementally out to November of this year the remaining 28 currently available expansions will start regular unlocks starting on February 5, 2026.  The dates for unlocks are currently: The Planes of Power unlocks on February 5, 2026 The Legacy of Ykesha unlocks on February 5, 2026 Lost Dungeons of Norrath unlocks on April 30, 2026 Gates of Discord unlocks on May 28, 2026 Omens of War unlocks on July 23, 2026 Dragons of Norrath unlocks on July 23, 2026 Depths of Darkhollow unlocks on October 15, 2026 Prophecy of Ro unlocks on December 10, 2026 The Serpent’s Spine unlocks on February 4, 2027 The Buried Sea unlocks on April 29, 2027 Secrets of Faydwer unlocks on June 24, 2027 Seeds of Destruction unlocks on September 16, 2027 Underfoot unlocks on December 9, 2027 House of Thule unlocks on February 3, 2028 Veil of Alaris unlocks on April 27, 2028 Rain of Fear unlocks on July 20, 2028 Call of the Forsaken unlocks on October 12, 2028 The Darkened Sea unlocks on December 7, 2028 The Broken Mirror unlocks on March 1, 2029 Empires of Kunark unlocks on April 26, 2029 Ring of Scale unlocks on June 21, 2029 The Burning Lands unlocks on September 13, 2029 Torment of Velious unlocks on November 8, 2029 Claws of Veeshan unlocks on January 31, 2030 Terror of Luclin unlocks on March 28, 2030 Night of Shadows unlocks on June 20, 2030 Laurion’s Song unlocks on August 15, 2030 The Outer Brood unlocks on November 7, 2030 That gets us out to the end of 2030, but there will be at least five, and possibly six, additional expansions arriving so I may very well be retired before Fangbreaker reaches its final destination.  It will certainly be 2032 before they arrive at the full live server compliment of expansions. The weight of all those expansions makes an EverQuest progression server something of a commitment if you plan to see it out to the very end. Then again, World of Warcraft only has 10 expansion yet I expect Blizz won’t be done with their progression plans with the first round of servers before 2032 at their current rate of progress.  So EverQuest keeps things moving.
