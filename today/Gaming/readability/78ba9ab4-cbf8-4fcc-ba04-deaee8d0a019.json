  "description": "I like a good puzzle game, but to be honest I don't play them all that often. Not because I'm bad at them, thanks for assuming I'm a numpty, it's more just that I prefer games with a really good hook to them - think Portal as the prime example of such a game. Clean, knows exactly what it is, and uses its concept in increasingly interesting ways without overstaying its welcome. I have no idea if Chromatic Conundrum will manage that or not, but I've never seen a game use light as part of its puzzles in quite the same way before. Read more",

  "text": "Now you're thinking with light Image credit: Digs I like a good puzzle game, but to be honest I don't play them all that often. Not because I'm bad at them, thanks for assuming I'm a numpty, it's more just that I prefer games with a really good hook to them - think Portal as the prime example of such a game. Clean, knows exactly what it is, and uses its concept in increasingly interesting ways without overstaying its welcome. I have no idea if Chromatic Conundrum will manage that or not, but I've never seen a game use light as part of its puzzles in quite the same way before. You can take a look at a snippet of gameplay below, but here's the lowdown: you need to move around boxes that emit different coloured lights to line-up with on sensors to open doors (think of Portal again and having to put boxes on buttons). Overlapping these boxes can create new colours, which you might need for certain sensors. Sometimes, you'll need to cast shadows so that certain sensors are left in the dark. It's one of those kinds of games that are so simple in concept, but it's the execution that really sells it to you. I'm a really big fan of how simple it all looks. There really is no denying Portal's influence on this game, add a few more textures in there and it could be an Aperture Science test chamber. The stark black and white really makes the colours pop though, really shows you how clean, simple design is sometimes the best way to go. Of course, immediately it feels like this could be a problem for colour blind people, and there's no mention anywhere of any kind of accessibility features, but it still looks to be early enough days for the puzzle game, so hopefully that's something that gets added in. Those of you as enamoured as I am by Chromatic Conundrum can wishlist the game on Steam right here.",
