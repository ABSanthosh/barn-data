  "text": "Little Corners is all about putting stickers of objects in various different locations in order to create your own world. I have been seeing sticker sets which have a background room and tons of stuff to decorate them go viral on social media for quite some time. They are something I have ordered and been interested in, so when I saw the demo for this game, I was curious about how this sort of sticker experience would feel in a digital space. While I only got a taste of the experience from the available demo, the full game looks to have five different rooms to design. The first room is an Alchemy Room, which has over 220 different mini-stickers you can peel off, place, and rearrange. There isn’t a guide or any sort of client to build for, so you are free to put the stickers wherever you would like to put them. There is cozy music playing in the background and you can sift through your sticker sheets, finding the perfect item to take up a space. It’s actually quite simple to scroll through the sort of levels of the stickers so that they can be placed behind other objects. This lets you play around with the space in some nice ways without the stickers overlapping each other, making sure everything fits nicely. You can also rotate the items as well (which is also good for placement). It’s quite easy to tinker around with everything and create the perfect room. Little Corners is a short game that doesn’t tell you when you’re done or have a win feature. Once you are happy with your room, you can just be finished and move on. It’s just a lovely little experience. Little Corners is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can grab a demo from itch.io or wishlist the game on Steam.
