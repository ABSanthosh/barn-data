  "text": "Solid snake.With so many to choose from, even the best gaming chairs can start to blend together, but that's definitely not the case for the Razer Iskur V2. Razer’s snake-inspired aesthetic is woven into the chair in a way that offers a unique look, but it doesn't forget that the priority is comfort – it doesn't come cheap, however. I've put it through its paces and can attest to its impressive comfort, making a strong case within a crowded field of chairs.Razer Iskur V2 - PhotosRazer Iskur V2 – Design and FeaturesThe original Razer Iskur we reviewed took the top spot in Razer's gaming chair lineup and made waves with its unique design and lumbar system. Its backrest was tensioned and looked almost spring-loaded, and while it did the job of offering pronounced support, it wasn't an instant hit precisely because of how pronounced its support was. The Iskur V2 changed all of that, refining its support and aesthetic while maintaining its unique identity and premium positioning. Looking at the Iskur, the word \"bold\" comes to mind immediately. It's a large chair and stands imposingly just under five feet tall and has a 27-inch circumference, including its wheelbase. Its lumbar support is redesigned from the original, but stands out from the rest of the chair with its own separate piece. And, unifying it with the original, it’s again embroidered in a pattern that resembles snakeskin. Care to sit on an anaconda? Want your own serpent throne, a real life lizard king? That’s the vibe, and if you’re not down for it, this may not be the chair for you.Despite its aggressive styling, Razer has actually reeled it in with this revision. There's no longer the \"For Gamers. By Gamers.\" tagline embroidered on the front of the seat, and the bolsters are no longer as steep. You can pick it up in black and green, or a simpler all-black color scheme, and you can get either with fabric materials or Razer's own leatherette finish. Or, for something even more homey (albeit still snakey), there's a gray and black fabric version available. No matter which you choose, the chair is all around more accommodating for different body types and sitting styles.[The Iskur V2] offers the kind of improvements I always hope to see from iterations on existing designs.Razer didn't spare any expense in fit and finish. I was sent the black and green leatherette version, and the build quality was excellent across the board. There wasn't a single stray thread or scuff on the plastic or metal elements like its polished arms. As one of the biggest brands in the business, Razer has faced its fair share of criticisms for build quality and durability over time for its peripherals. But over the years I've covered it, the brand has responded to the criticisms in a big way, and the Iskur V2 is a great example of where it led to tangible results. It's right up there with the very best gaming chairs you can buy today in its craftsmanship.With an MSRP of $650, it checks every box you would expect for a premium-priced gaming chair. It uses a steel frame and aluminum wheelbase for long-term durability. Its cushioning is thick and balances firmness with pliability, so it's comfortable out of the box. The leatherette feels robust while remaining soft to the touch, though breathability is still an issue. The armrests deserve special mention – they're four-dimensional like most other premium gaming chairs, which means you can adjust them for height, depth, width, and rotation, but they offer an extended height range. This lends them greater versatility, especially if you have a higher desk and want to line up your armrests flush with the edge. They're also topped with a soft enough foam that, while firmer than gel or memory foam armrests, is soft enough to lean on without causing elbow pain. I also appreciate the polished metal used on the arms. It’s not a touch unique to Razer, but it looks great and definitely evokes a sense of small sense of luxury you don’t get with typical armrests. There’s more going on under the surface here, and there’s a renewed emphasis on comfort and accommodation for different sitting styles and preferences. The flattening of the bolsters, especially on the seat, makes a big difference. I was able to cross one and both legs beneath me without feeling them press uncomfortably into my legs, so criss-cross-applesauce sitters are well served. The same is true of the backrest, the two going hand in hand, so leaning in either direction is more comfortable. The biggest change, however, comes with its lumbar system. While the original Iskur used a cable and tension system to wing out the lumbar support and press into your back, this version is more traditional and frankly, much more effective. Beneath the textured scales of the lower backrest is a flexible plate that can move to properly match your back. Positioning was the biggest issue our reviewer took with the V1’s lumbar, in fact, and this both addresses it and enhances how supportive the lumbar system can actually be.Razer calls the lumbar support “6D” to probably play on everyone’s knowledge of “4D” with highly adjustable armrests, but that’s a bit of a stretch. Knobs on either side of the chair allow you to move the lumbar curve up and down and tailor precisely how aggressive its curvature is. The other dimensions come from the flexibility of the plate, allowing it to move with you as you shift your weight or twist side to side.The lumbar isn’t the only ergonomic refinement, either. The seat cushion has also been reworked to provide dual densities of firmness. In simpler terms, it’s softer where your butt and legs go, reducing the amount of pressure experienced by your underside. It’s one of those things that you don’t consider until someone points it out, but the actual impact is that you can sit for longer without feeling it in your body. It also comes with a downright delightful neck pillow. It’s soft memory foam trimmed with velour and shaped to cradle the neck – gaming chair brands take notice, this is how you do support pillows.Of course, you can rock and recline, both of which are adjustable for how much resistance you can feel. The Iskur V2 doesn’t quite deliver a full laying position at 152 degrees of recline, but it’s not far off and great for putting your feet up on whatever you have under your desk. The rock tension will likely need some adjustment out of the box, but it’s worth taking the time to really dial it in for the best balance of support and leeway.Razer Iskur V2 – AssemblyIf you've ever built a gaming chair before, assembling the Iskur V2 doesn't offer many surprises. It comes mostly disassembled, except for the armrests on the seat. Helpfully, Razer puts all of the fasteners into position ahead of time, so you don't need to guess about which screw goes in which position. It also provides the wrench you'll need to complete the process without providing any tools of your own. All-in-all, the assembly process took me about 20 minutes (including taking these photos). I would suggest having an extra set of hands available, purely due to size, if possible; while the assembly process is pretty much entirely typical, the backrest can feel a bit unwieldy when attaching it to the seat. Overall, assembling the chair is straightforward and shouldn't pose much difficulty if you're slightly handy. If it's your first time, detailed instructions are included in the box to guide you through the process.Razer Iskur V2 – PerformanceThe Iskur V2 is rated to support an especially wide range of heights, spanning 5-foot 2-inches all the way up to 6-foot 5-inches. I fall right in the middle at 5-foot 8-inches, and though I didn't quite feel like I was swimming, it definitely felt larger around me than a typical gaming chair. There is currently no XL version for the V2, just for the original, but this could easily work as a big and tall chair as is (provided you're within its 299-pound weight limit).I was lucky enough to have the ability to test the chair intermixed with the cheaper Iskur V2 X model that I am also reviewing. I spent about a month with both and can say that this higher-end V2 version is far more comfortable, and more so than you might first guess based on its aggressive styling. When properly dialed in, the lumbar support is very effective in preventing me from developing soreness, even over longer gaming and work sessions. The seat itself is superb and the dual-density foam makes a noticeable difference. In truth, I was surprised to see that here because the top-end Anthros chair, which is more than triple the base price, applies a similar approach toward pressure relief with dual density foam, while adding cutouts to further enhance the effect. It’s immediately more comfortable to sit on and remains so over multiple hours, and it makes the Iskur V2 truly stand out.Given that the chair emphasizes ergonomics and support, as I mentioned before, it's very important that it be properly adjusted for your body. Trying to use it straight out of the box is a recipe for a sore back. It's important that you dial in the position and curvature of the lumbar support correctly, or else it can actually have the opposite effect and push your back and spine out of alignment. When fully personalized, however, it’s a very accommodating and versatile gaming chair. Between its gentler bolsters, versatile armrests, and overall improved comfort, I was able to freely swap between gaming with a mouse and keyboard, sitting upright with a controller, or leaning back with my feet up. The only thing I didn’t like is trying to fully lay back. I’m not one for power naps at my desk, but in the fully reclined position, the lumbar was too pronounced and needed to be reset. This wasn’t a big deal for me and only takes a minute or so to readjust, but it’s something to keep in mind if you’re a deskside napper.Originally posted: Jul 11, 2025 11:39 pmVerdictTo put it plainly, the Razer Iskur V2 is a superb gaming chair.
