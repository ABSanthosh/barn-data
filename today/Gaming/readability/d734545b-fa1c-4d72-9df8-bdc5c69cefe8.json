I’m going to do that thing people don’t like, where I remind you about the inevitable passage of time. If that’s the sort of thing that does about as much damage to you as failing to comply when ordered by ED-209, then look away now. Today marks 38 years since RoboCop’s debut and what better way to celebrate than with a double feature. On the surface, “RoboCop” might feel like a gratuitous action flick, but that would be ignoring the deep worldbuilding, themes, and characterization explored across these movies. It’s also deeply satirical and not afraid to have fun, with some iconic jokes, gags, and one-liners.   These were a must when it came to building RoboCop: Rogue City, a first-person shooter that launched at the end of 2023 and is available today with Game Pass for Xbox Series X|S and Xbox PC! As RoboCop, you can hit the streets, interrogate witnesses, and complete objectives in alignment with your moral compass. If you’ve still not checked out Rogue City, now’s the perfect time. Rogue City was a fantastic success for us, and that’s down to the passionate fans. Their support also gave us the opportunity to work on a follow-up, RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business.  If Rogue City is a little more about downtime, exploring Old Detroit, and experiencing the life of RoboCop, then Unfinished Business can be considered playing a high intensity RoboCop movie. Unfinished Business begins with a group of mercenaries tearing through the Metro West Precinct, bodies and bullets left in their wake. With components stolen from RoboCop’s chair, their objective is clear: the OmniTower. Combine these with the technology at the top, and they can seize control of all OCP technology, including RoboCop. The stakes are high and since the OmniTower is outside the Detroit Police Department’s jurisdiction, it means RoboCop is going in alone. Unfinished Business follows on from Rogue City, and both games sit between “RoboCop 2” and “RoboCop 3” on the timeline. This gives us a lot of lore to draw from, it means we can introduce new enemies, like the katana wielding androids (those don’t look like OCP tech), or jetpack users, who rain fire down from above. These threats turn each level of the OnniTower into a puzzle that needs to be solved.  How will you navigate the turrets, drones, and the small army of heavily armored mercs standing between you and the summit. One of the most important things for players is that they feel the power of being RoboCop, we’ve kept the option to toss enemies and objects with ease, but we’ve also added powerful environmental finishers where the camera pulls back and see RoboCop in action. This was in response to feedback from our players who wanted to see more of the iconic hero. Another thing we wanted to do with Unfinished Business is to dive deeper into the man in the machine. Humanity has always been a core theme in this series, and while the bulk of the story takes place in the OmniTower, levels that put you into the shoes of different characters present new gameplay styles that serve as a change of pace throughout the campaign. When playing as Alex Murphy back when he was a beat cop, players will need to alter their playstyle without RoboCop’s powerful armor serving as a shield. Ammo counts become important when you can’t fall back on the Auto-9, but more than that, it’s an opportunity for us to build on Murphy’s story. The link between Murphy and RoboCop was a crux in the films, something that Peter Weller was known for doing so well, and the reason we needed to get him back for the standalone — welcome back to Old Detroit, Murphy. It’s a great day for RoboCop fans! RoboCop: Rogue City is available today with Game Pass and the action-packed standalone follow-up, RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business, is available now for Xbox Series X|S! RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business ROBOCOP IS BACK ON DUTY TO SETTLE UNFINISHED BUSINESS FIGHT YOUR WAY TO THE TOP FLOOR Following RoboCop's decisive victory over Detroit's gangs, a new chapter unfolds in this standalone extension set after the events of RoboCop: Rogue City. The New Guy in Town has been defeated, but the streets are still riddled with crime. A spark of hope comes from OCP’s latest project: OmniTower – a massive housing complex designed specifically to provide for the needs of the residents of Old Detroit. But when a group of highly trained mercenaries armed with cutting-edge weapons takes control of the building and turns it into their deadly fortress, RoboCop must take action to put a stop to their plans and uphold the law. FACE A DEADLIER CLASS OF CRIMINALS Prepare to take on a new breed of enemies: OmniTower is packed with high-tech threats. From flying drones to exploding bots and anti-personnel turrets, every floor is riddled with deadly traps, and heavily armed elite troops. Expect to face minigun-toting armoured squads, special forces equipped with jet packs or even katana-wielding foes who look more machine than man. RESTORE ORDER WITH JUSTICE SERVED COLD When it’s too late to shout \"freeze\", you can rely on RoboCop’s arsenal to to cool down enemies' ambitions. Choose from a wide range of powerful weapons to serve Justice, including the iconic Auto-9 or the all-new Cryo Cannon.

A spark of hope comes from OCP’s latest project: OmniTower – a massive housing complex designed specifically to provide for the needs of the residents of Old Detroit.\n\nBut when a group of highly trained mercenaries armed with cutting-edge weapons takes control of the building and turns it into their deadly fortress, RoboCop must take action to put a stop to their plans and uphold the law. \n\nFACE A DEADLIER CLASS OF CRIMINALS\nPrepare to take on a new breed of enemies: OmniTower is packed with high-tech threats.\n\nFrom flying drones to exploding bots and anti-personnel turrets, every floor is riddled with deadly traps, and heavily armed elite troops. Expect to face minigun-toting armoured squads, special forces equipped with jet packs or even katana-wielding foes who look more machine than man.\n\nRESTORE ORDER WITH JUSTICE SERVED COLD\nWhen it’s too late to shout \u0026#34;freeze\u0026#34;, you can rely on RoboCop’s arsenal to to cool down enemies\u0026#39; ambitions. Choose from a wide range of powerful weapons to serve Justice, including the iconic Auto-9 or the all-new Cryo Cannon.\nUnleash RoboCop\u0026#39;s unmatched strength to deliver devastating finishing moves – whether smashing an opponent’s skull against a concrete wall or into the nearest drinks vending machine.\n\nPLAY AS ALEX MURPHY AND ED-209\nExperience unique missions with familiar faces which reveal more of the storyline of Unfinished Business.\n\nBefore becoming RoboCop, he was plain old police officer Alex Murphy, brave and resolute, but all too vulnerable on the beat in Old Detroit. Discover a different side of the legendary law enforcer, voiced by Peter Weller.\n\nStep into the big boots of ED-209 and make the mercs know the efficiency of the iconic urban pacifier in action.
