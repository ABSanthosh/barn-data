  "text": "Plus fresh photo mode additions and customisation for your motor Image credit: CD Projekt Cyberpunk 2077's previously delayed update 2.3 drops tomorrow, July 17th, CD Projekt have revealed in their latest livestream. It's mostly about giving you more options in terms of traversing the world, because adding in a whole metro system post-launch didn't do enough in that regard. The studio will not stop, even though they're now making Cyberpunk 2. They've worked with fellow developers Virtuos to add-in some new cars, a taxi system, self-driving cars, and other stuff not related to getting from A to B. The biggest aspects of the update, though, are those aids for exploration. There are three new cars in total - the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru, the Rayfield Caliburn 'Mordred', and the Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila - plus the game's first customisable motorbike, the Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa. All execept the Aquila come with small quests to complete to unlock them, so it isn't as simple as just buying from a website. If you get one and don't fancy negotiating the traffic yourself, every vehicle in the game now has an auto-driving feature that'll transport you to your chosen map waypoint. Or, if you fancy taking a robotic cab instead, once you've completed the Delamain quest, you can call him up and request a taxi that'll drive you where you want to go. Sure, it's more immersive than flying through the roof of the map in a modded car/plane doing about 1000mph, but is it really better? REDstreams — Update 2.3 Overview Watch on YouTube These come with a new cinematic camera you can use to look around as you're driven about, and there's an auto-drive wandering mode you can activate if you just want a bit of a tour. That'll be cool to sit back and watch, though Cyberpunk's maybe a bit hardware intensive to be the ideal second monitor screen saver. There are also a bunch of extra crystalcoat and twintone customisation for cars, to ensure you can pimp your ride in whatever fashion you fancy. Then, there's the photo mode, which now offers you more control over the environment, plus access to a wide range of extra characters from the base game and alternate outfits for those characters - the idea being that if you see them wearing something in a quest, you'll be able to have them wear it once the quest is done. As for technical updates, AMD FSR 4 and 3.1 frame generation support are coming, but you'll have to wait for a driver update at some point soon to be able to use the former. Intel XESS 2.0 and HDR10+ support also arrives with the update, so you can whip that out if you've got the hardware to match. It's nice to see CD Projekt keep working on the game and adding in stuff players have requested, especially if it can be done via efficient development with help from Virtuos. Keeps us all cyberticking over until we're auto-driven to the sequel.",
