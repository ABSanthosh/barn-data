But fans won't have to wait very long to learn what else Microsoft's gaming division has planned for the future, as the next Xbox Showcase is scheduled to take place in February.According to IGN, this year's IGN Fan Fest will begin with an Xbox Showcase on February 24. Aside from the reveal of \"the next big collaboration for Balatro,\" details are scarce about what to specifically expect beyond trailers and gameplay footage. However, the announcement of the showcase does note that there will be several reveals from indie studios including Raw Fury, Team 17, Akapura, 11 Bit, and more.During one of last year's Xbox Showcases, Microsoft announced World Of Warcraft: The War Within and Doom: The Dark Ages, as well as 2025 titles including South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Fragpunk, and Fable. We can only speculate which titles will be showcased in February, but we'd certainly like to see more of Gears of War: E-Day, the upcoming prequel to the long-running shooter franchise.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Microsoft recently revealed that Forza Horizon 5 is coming to PS5, and there have been rumors for months that Halo: The Master Chief Collection may be going to Sony's console as well. Doom: The Dark Ages and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle are also headed to PS5 later this year. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com",
