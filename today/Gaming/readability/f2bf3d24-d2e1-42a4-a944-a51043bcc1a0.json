  "description": "Final Fantasy is coming to Magic: The Gathering...After its first reveal two years ago, Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy--the collaboration set between Wizards of the Coast and Square Enix featuring all 16 mainline Final Fantasy games--is a month away from release. Today, during its PAX East panel, Wizards of the Coast kicked off the Final Fantasy set preview season by showing off multiple cards from the main set, the Commander pre-constructed decks, and the Final Fantasy: Through The Ages bonus sheet.The panel showed cards from every Final Fantasy game, starting with the original and working all the way through to Final Fantasy XVI. The main set will consist of over 400 cards, and the four preconstructed Commander Decks will consist of 100 cards each.The Final Fantasy: Through The Ages bonus sheet, meanwhile, includes 64 reprints from Magic's history--four cards for every game in the FF Franchise--that are reskinned with artwork from Final Fantasy's decades-long history. Through The Ages cards will appear in one out of every three Play Boosters and every Collector Booster.Below is every card shown during the panel, in the same order they were presented. Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy launches in local game stores and big box retailers on June 13, with prerelease events scheduled to begin at local game stores on June 6. Garland, Knight of Cornelia // Chaos, the EndlessThe panel began with a card previously shown during the first reveal in February, Garland, Knight of Cornelia, who can transform into Chaos, the Endless. Transformation is a big part of the Final Fantasy expansion, with double-faced cards appearing throughout the set. White Mage's Staff and Black Mage's RodNext are two common Equipment cards that show off one of the set's new mechanics, Job Select.Job Select cards create a 1/1 Hero creature token, which are then immediately equipped with the Equipment card that was cast. Each Equipment card with Job Select adds a creature type to the equipped creature--Cleric for White Mage's Staff, Wizard for Black Mage's Rod, etc.--along with an extra buff. Firion, Wild Rose Warrior and Firion, SwordmasterFinal Fantasy II's protagonist was next on the list, with two cards featuring Firion shown--one from the main set and one from the Through The Ages bonus sheet. Firion, Wild Rose Warrior can duplicate Equipment cards for a turn and make equipped creatures gain haste, which will be music to Equipment-heavy decks in red.Firion, Swordmaster, meanwhile, is a reprint of Sram, Senior Edificer, which discounts Aura, Equipment, and Vehicle spells. The card features the original Firion artwork drawn by Yoshitaka Amano in the late 1980s. The Darkness CrystalMoving on to Final Fantasy III, The Darkness Crystal is part of a \"cycle\"--a MTG term for a set of five cards, one in each color, with a running theme. In this case, the theme is \"powerful crystal,\" and each will discount spells that match its color by one mana whenever they're on the field.The Darkness Crystal, however, causes all opposing creatures to be exiled on death rather than put in the graveyard, and then it can bring those creatures back from exile under the crystal owner's control. Cecil, Dark Knight // Cecil, Redeemed PaladinNext, the panel moved to Final Fantasy IV, where Cecil's double-faced card was shown again. Also revealed during the first look in February, Cecil can change from dark knight to holy warrior as soon as its controller is down half of their life. Kain, Traitorous DragoonCecil's counterpart, the dragoon Kain, was revealed next, and true to his betraying ways, Kain can join another player's board whenever he deals damage, leaving his former owner with a decent payoff, but a lot less life. Gilgamesh, Master-at-ArmsThe panel then jumped to Final Fantasy V, where Gilgamesh, Master-at-Arms, made an appearance. Gilgamesh lets you dig through the top six cards of your deck for Equipment, put them on the battlefield, and then give one of those Equipment to a fellow Samurai creature on your side of the board. Summon: Esper ValigarmandaFinal Fantasy VI--the first game on the list to receive a companion Commander pre-con deck--was next, and after looking at the Terra card previously revealed, the panel showed off one of the cards exclusively found in the deck: Esper Valigarmanda.This Summon can exile spells from each opponent's graveyard, and then it can cast one of them per turn, for the next three turns, using any color of mana to cast them. Terra, Magical Adept // Esper TerraThe next card revealed was another Terra card, but this one not only has the ability to transform into Esper Terra, it also features original artwork from Amano-san himself.Not to be outdone, the next preview featured Terra's biggest enemy… Kefka, Court Mage // Kefka, Ruler of RuinThe evil jester Kefka made his MTG debut on the very next card, which also featured two brand-new pieces of art from Amano-san. In fact, according to the panel, this was the first time ever that Amano-san had drawn Kefka's final form. Traveling ChocoboWith the move to Final Fantasy VII came Traveling Chocobo, the top Chocobo card in the set. Of course, this being a FF7 Chocobo, that means there are likely to be variants… Traveling Chocobo (Variants)…which there are, in the form of multiple colors of Traveling Chocobo! These variants can only be found in Collector Boosters.You may have noticed one notable color is missing. That's because… Traveling Chocobo (Gold Serialized)…it's the Headliner of the Final Fantasy set!Headliner cards are serialized cards with unique artwork that can only be found in Collector Boosters. Most of the time, a serialized card will out of 250 or 500--this golden Traveling Chocobo, however, will only see 77 versions printed throughout the world. Cloud, Midgar MercenaryNext up was the hero of FF7 himself, Cloud, Midgar Mercenary, whose main ability allowed him to get double the effects of Equipment cards attached to him. Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER // Sephiroth, One-Winged AngelWhere Cloud goes, Sephiroth follows, and his main-set card features beautiful artwork from Tetsuya Nomura himself. Sephiroth can also sacrifice creatures around him to drain life from an opponent, and eventually he can transform into the One-Winged Angel. Aerith GainsboroughBetween Cloud and Sephiroth sits Aerith, so it's fitting she was next to be shown. Aerith rewards you for gaining life by making herself stronger, and then when she dies, she hands those buffs to every other legendary creature on your side of the board. Tifa Lockhart // Tifa, Martial ArtistTifa times two featured on the panel next, with Tifa, Martial Artist from the Commander deck and Tifa Lockhart from the main set. Main set Tifa gains power for every land card you play, while Commander deck Tifa gets stronger each time you attack multiple opponents, while also doubling up combat phases if she or another creature hit a certain power level. Squall, SeeD MercenaryThe hero of Final Fantasy VIII, Squall Leonhart, appeared next. His ability gives every lone attacker double strike--meaning they attack twice per combat--and if Squall is the one dealing damage, he can bring back a creature from the graveyard. Rinoa Heartily and AngeloThe sorceress Rinoa and her trusty dog Angelo--who gets his own token!--were confirmed the main set, with Rinoa creating the Angelo token when she's cast. Rinoa can then buff the token or any other creature once per turn, and the more creatures you have on board, the stronger the buff becomes. Kuja, Genome Sorcerer // Trance Kuja, Fate DefiedThe villain of Final Fantasy IX, Kuja, was next up, and his Wizard-focused ability set will make Wizards decks in black and red very interesting moving forward. The transformation to Trance Kuja, which doubles all Wizards' power, is icing on the cake. Zidane TribalAnother Through The Ages card was revealed next, this time it's FF9 hero Zidane Tribal as Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer, one of the most powerful cards printed in the last few years. Vivi Ornitier and Fire MagicThe fan-favorite Vivi will get his own MTG card, and one that can deliver a ridiculous amount of mana with the right power-ups.Fire Magic, meanwhile, showcases the new Tiered Magic mechanic; here, spells can grow more powerful depending on how much mana is spent to cast them. Yuna, Hope of SpiraWith the move to Final Fantasy X came a look at Yuna, Hope of Spira, which not only makes enchantment creatures like Summons more powerful, but she can also bring Summons back from the graveyard for another go. Summon: BahamutSpeaking of summons, here's Bahamut, who gives the table four turns before he obliterates everyone for damage equal to the total mana value of all of its controller's permanents. If the player that cast Bahamut has 20 mana's worth of permanents on the board, that's 20 damage to each opponent. Zanarkand, Ancient MetropolisThe first rare land card shown during the panel was Zanarkand, which not only features the new Town subtype for lands, but also shows off the Adventure mechanic, which will appear on land cards for the first time ever in the Final Fantasy set. Cast the Adventure spell first, exile the card, then bring it back as a land later on. Absolute VirtueThe first card from Final Fantasy XI is Absolute Virtue, who makes it impossible to hurt its controller simply by being on the battlefield. It also can't be countered, so if it's cast, it's going to resolve without issue. Balthier and FranThe lone Final Fantasy XII card shown during the panel was a duo, Balthier and Fran, who can power up Vehicle-type cards and allow you to deal extra damage through a repeat combat phase. Lightning, Army of OneThe hero of Final Fantasy XIII, Lightning, has a very interesting ability; if she deals damage to an opponent, then until your next turn, any damage that player takes will be doubled. In a multiplayer match, that means you could cause one of your opponents to be targeted because of the extra weakness. Fang, Fearless l'Cie and Vanille, Cheerful l'CieNext, we saw two cards with a mechanic that can only be found with these two cards. If you have both Fang and Vanille on the battlefield, and you pay the mana cost listed in Vanille's ability text, you can \"meld\" them together into one massive creature… Ragnarok, Divine Deliverance…Ragnarok, which is not only a nigh-impossible creature to take down, but it will take another permanent down with it, while also restoring a permanent from your graveyard in the process. Summoner's GrimoireFinal Fantasy XIV came next, and after a look at Y'shtola, the commander of the FFXIV pre-constructed deck, the panel revealed Summoner's Grimoire. This is another Job Select card that allows the equipped creature to place a creature from their hand onto the battlefield--and if it's an enchantment creature, it comes in tapped and attacking.Combine this with the Bahamut we saw earlier, and you could be bringing in Bahamut way sooner than expected. Zodiark, Umbral GodAnother FFXIV card, Zodiark immediately deletes half of every player's non-God creatures simply by entering the battlefield. If that weren't enough, every creature he sacrifices gives him extra power. Noctis, Prince of LucisFrom FFXIV to Final Fantasy XV, next was Noctis, Prince of Lucis, who can bring back artifacts from the graveyard by paying some life as an extra cost. In artifact-heavy decks, this could be a powerful boost. Clive, Ifrit's Dominant // Ifrit, Warden of InfernoFinal Fantasy XVI's hero Clive was the penultimate card shown off, and as expected, Clive can transform into Ifrit at any time so long as you pay the mana. Ifrit, meanwhile, immediately eliminates an opponent's creature through the fight mechanic, and then adds four extra mana to the mana pool each turn until he turns back into Clive. Cid, Timeless ArtificerThe final card--or, technically, 15 cards–shown at the panel were 15 variants of Cid, Timeless Artificer. Cid is a recurring name in Final Fantasy, and Magic reflects this by not only featuring 15 different versions of the same card, but it also allows you to play as many copies of Cid as you want, no matter the format.",
