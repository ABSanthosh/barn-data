  "text": "One of the best Black Friday deals on a high-end gaming monitor is still available, and it might potentially run through Cyber Monday, which lands on December 2. Amazon is offering the massive 57\" Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 Dual 4K UHD gaming monitor at the exclusive price of $1,482.23. That's a little more than $100 less than everyone else's gaming monitor Black Friday deal and nearly 50% off the retail price. There is currenlty no other monitor to compare it with. If you're looking for the biggest and sharpest super ultra-wide gaming monitor on the planet, this would be it right here.57\" Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 Dual 4K Monitor57\" Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 Dual 4K 240Hz Gaming MonitorThe 57\" Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is the first 57\" Dual 4K UHD monitor on the market, boasting an eye-watering 7680x2160 resolution, or the equivalent of two 4K UHD monitors stacked next to each other. Despite the display being so large, you're treated to a pixel density of 140ppi. To put that into perspective, it's as sharp as a 32\" 4K monitor. Wow.The Odyssey Neo G9 is equipped with a Mini LED backlight paired with a quantum dot (QLED) panel. Like its namesake suggests, mini-LED panels have smaller LEDs than traditional LED LCD monitors, so you can squeeze in more lighting zones. Mini-LED monitors are also much brighter than OLED monitors, which is very important because larger monitors are generally dimmer than smaller ones to start. Local dimming combined with higher brightness improves contrast ratio and HDR and is also useful in overpowering glare and reflections. The Samsung Neo G9 isn't a one-trick pony, and all the other specs live up to what we'd expect from a top-end gaming monitor. The display boasts an aggressive 1000R curve that practically hugs you as you play games. Curved panels are useless with small monitors but extremely helpful with super-wide ones. It also features a 1ms response time and 240Hz refresh rate. It is HDR1000 certified, which means that it can maintain peak brightness up to 1,000nits. It's explicitly FreeSync Premium Pro certified (although it will probably also work in G-Sync compatibility mode).Obviously, the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 isn't a monitor for everyone. You need a rather generous gaming budget. Also, not all games support this resolution and aspect ratio. Some games will have letterboxing to compensate. Finally, gaming at dual 4K UHD resolution is extremely GPU intensive. Make sure you have a good graphics card that can handle the load. We'd recommend something no less powerful than an RTX 4070 Ti.Looking For More Black Friday Gaming Monitor Deals?Take advantage of some fantastic Black Friday pricing on the best gaming monitors, from high-end monitors with OLED panels, 240Hz refresh rate, and 4K resolution to perfectly capable 1080p 144Hz gaming monitors that fall well within the tightest of budgets. Whether you're intending to use the monitor for your gaming PC or PlayStation 5 console, there's definitely a perfect monitor for everyone.Will the Deals Change for Cyber Monday?In my experience, many of the same deals we saw on Black Friday will return for Cyber Monday 2024, including deals that were sold out or expired. Retailers usually release their hottest selling items in batches so that every sale event has at least some inventory reserved. That said, I also expect plenty of new, never before seen deals. Traditionally, Black Friday was known as the \"retail holiday,\" where the best deals were found in-store, and Cyber Monday was known as the \"online holiday,\" where the best deals were online only. Although today the lines have blurred, it is still true that many online only retailers still consider Cyber Monday the sale event of the year instead of Black Friday. Expect some amazing sales to come out of online-only sites like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, Lenovo and several online-only deals from traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. In fact, Amazon has taken the preemptive and already switched over to Cyber Monday.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
