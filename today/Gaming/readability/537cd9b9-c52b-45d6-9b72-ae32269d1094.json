  "text": "Hi everyone, it’s Samar Louwe here, game director at Vertigo Games. Just last week during State of Play, we were thrilled to finally announce that Metro Awakening is coming to PS VR2 on November 7. Today, we’re excited to share another glimpse into the game with a new video showcasing extended gameplay on PS VR2. We’ve crafted a journey that intertwines gripping storytelling with deeply immersive gameplay. In Metro Awakening, you’ll confront the mysteries and dangers of a post-apocalyptic world, where survival and exploration are more critical than ever. As you navigate both familiar and new locations, each filled with supernatural threats, you’ll uncover the origin story of Khan, one of the Metro series’ most enigmatic characters.  Become what you fear… At the heart of Metro Awakening lies the powerful story of Serdar—a doctor searching for his missing wife. Throughout his journey, Serdar undergoes a profound transformation that leads him to awaken as Khan, a mystic figure who plays a recurring role throughout the Metro series. Known for his deep connection to the supernatural, Khan appears at critical moments, offering guidance to Metro’s protagonist, Artyom, and all who dare to navigate the dangers of the tunnels. This standalone narrative was crafted by series creator Dmitry Glukhovsky and explores the events that shaped Khan into who he is, immersing players in the philosophical struggles defining his path for the first time. As a prequel to Metro 2033, it also serves as an excellent starting point for newcomers to the franchise, while offering longtime fans a story that complements the rich lore they have come to love. In Metro Awakening, we’ve translated the series’ iconic elements to VR. You’ll engage with classic mechanics, including the wristwatch, gas mask, flashlight, universal charger and lighter—each playing a key role in stealth and survival.  The watch not only shows whether you’re in the light or in the dark but also counts down the time until your gas mask filter needs replacing. The mask, in particular, requires constant attention; fogged lenses require you to physically wipe them during tense moments, while the watch’s timer beeps in a countdown, warning you before your filter clogs with radioactive dust, adding to the mounting pressure. Charging your flashlight is also essential for survival. When darkness envelops you, you’ll need to wind it manually using the universal charger, increasing the stakes as every action pulls you deeper. The lighter is extremely important for burning through cobwebs. These mechanics create a great immersive experience on PS VR2, making every interaction feel immediate and vital, and drawing you even more into the atmosphere of the Metro universe. Elevating Metro Awakening with PS VR2 Immersion is the essence of both VR and the Metro series, and the PS VR2 elevates this experience. As the story unfolds, you’ll dive into the mysterious, supernatural aspects of Metro. VR allows us to amplify these moments, enveloping players in eerie atmospheres and using spatial audio to draw you into the unknown. Every shot fired is intentional. With adaptive triggers, you’ll add weight and precision to your actions. Combat isn’t just about pulling the trigger; it’s about survival. The subtle resistance of the triggers heightens the tension, making every shot count when resources are scarce. Headset feedback introduces a new level of physicality to gameplay, immersing you in your environment. You’ll feel the impact of debris from explosions or when you’re hit by enemy attacks, amplifying your experience. Metro Awakening thrives on contrasts—light and dark, hope and despair. The PS VR2’s 4K HDR display brings this to life, especially in haunting locations. Dynamic lighting enhances the atmosphere. Using your headlamp to navigate dark tunnels or strategically shining it to sneak past mutants adds a tactical layer to gameplay. While visibility is key, mastering the shadows can give you a strategic edge in your encounters.   We designed every interaction in Metro Awakening to feel natural and grounded. From wiping your gas mask to managing your backpack, every action in VR is a manual endeavor. With no on-screen UI to rely on, you must adapt and survive as you would in real life. We can’t wait for you to step into Metro Awakening on PS VR2 starting November 7—or pre-order the Deluxe Edition to begin your journey early on November 5. Trending Stories",
