BUILD A WHOLE WORLD ON MOBILE This park builder simulation game is designed for smooth, intuitive play on your phone or tablet. Tap buildings to see details, drag to rearrange, and use your fingers to effortlessly adjust your 3D bird's-eye view of the park. - Created by Atari and Nvizzio Creations. Genre:Simulation, Strategy TouchArcade Rating:Unrated Compatibility:HD Universal Is this just the Netflix version of touch without the iap? Yup. Looks like it. This game had so many IAPs and so much progression/leveling system. Ruined it for me. @Rocksaint yes I just tried it for 10 min while I could grab a few min. Definitely think it’s the iap filled touch one, but I think I’ll give it a go now since it’s Netflix and won’t have all the iap. Still has idle earning for gold though so it’ll still be one you come and go from rather than play for hours on end I imagine. Problem is not being free of all IAPs. Problem for these games is that they are designed to be F2P. And Netflix doesn’t fix that. So it just feels like a F2P game pulled into a sub model. That’s it. But yeah, no harm in giving it a go if you’ve already got Netflix. The screenshots make it look so pretty with the images on the AppStore but I think it looks pretty ugly and dated, worse than even the original games looked for my taste anyway. The only aesthetic in the series I have any love for is the first one. When I saw this thread's title, I thought it was a subscription version of that one and thought it was a shame I wouldn't play it for that reason. When I saw the art style, I was relieved.
