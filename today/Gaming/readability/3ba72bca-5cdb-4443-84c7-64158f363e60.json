It’s part of my strategy now when I need a distraction, it feels really good to have plans to help me cope.\" \"The NSPCC is excited to announce the launch of the Game Safe Steam sale. The proceeds will help us to support children and young people through services, such as Childline,\" said Lewie Procter, head of gaming partnerships at the NSPCC. \"We are thrilled that popular games, such as Cluedo, Hypnospace Outlaw and Yes, Your Grace, are on sale, giving gaming fans a chance to make a difference. \"We want to thank Steam for partnering with us and to the developers and publishers for supporting this brilliant initiative.
