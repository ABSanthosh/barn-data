As you know, this is a great time of year for feline fashion. Rosieâ€™s also a big fanâ€¦ Tabs did some of his most memorable kitty modeling campaigns for fall, including his award-winning Autumn Leaves tutorial, which set the standard for feline makeup infographics for years to come. Rosie has kept the fall vibes going here at Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC, but Tabs was the cat who blazed the trail. Jeez, that swagger, those eyes, those markingsâ€¦ Simply incredible. ðŸ™‚ Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 834 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
