Image credit: Rare/ Bungie Everything is IP, all of the time, everywhere you look now, because big wigs in suits have got it in their heads that original, uniquely appealing content just can't win over a combination of pixels that resemble something someone already likes. Sea of Thieves is no stranger to crossovers, with big, thematically relevant ones like Monkey Island and Pirates of the Caribbean, as well as some smaller ones like Halo and Banjo Kazooie. Today's crossover is one of the smaller ones, this time with, uh… Destiny. The sci-fi, first-person shooter. Huh. Now, to be clear, like the Halo and Banjo Kazooie sets, this one is just about cosmetics, all of which were inspired by Destiny. That includes things like a ship set and crest, costume, weapons, there's no story stuff or anything like that. For the most part I don't think I'm a big fan of what's on offer, though I like the crest that's literally just Ghost dangling off the front of the ship like a Christmas bauble, that's cute. Lightbearer Cosmetics Reveal Trailer - Official Sea of Thieves Watch on YouTube Rare's director of brand and licensing Adam Park tried to justify the crossover a bit over on the Xbox Wire blog, saying that even thought it \"might not seem like an obvious choice, Destiny’s classes and co-operative play presented a ‘crew-like’ bond that we thought was a great fit.\" I'll be honest with you Mr. Park, I'm not entirely sure I buy into that myself, the two are quite wildly different games, but I guess sometimes you've got to get the bills paid, 'ey? In any case, the crossover is already in-game now, but it'll cost you a pretty penny. The Big Bundle, which includes every crossover item, will set you back 4999 Ancient Coins, which translates to $50 in real world money. That's live service, for you.",
