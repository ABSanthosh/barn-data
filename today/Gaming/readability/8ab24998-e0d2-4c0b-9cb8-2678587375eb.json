Amazon is offering the diminutive Dreamegg portable white noise machine for just $9.49 after you apply 50% off coupon code \"6TVMPOMB\" during checkout. I bought one the last time this went on sale and it has worked as intended in a nursery, keeping the baby soundly asleep.Dreamegg Portable White Noise Machine for $9.49Dreamegg Portable White Noise MachineThe Dreamegg measures less than 2\" cubed and weighs in at under 2oz, making it easy to carry along with you on your travels. You don't need to bring along a power brick or spare batteries either; the internal 1,000mAh battery (doubled in capacity compared to its gen 1 model) lasts all night long and the recharges over the universal USB Type-C standard.In terms of its features, the Dreamegg sound machine offers 16 soothing nature sounds, including ocean waves, rain, birds, fan sounds, and, of course, white noise. Since it's supposed to be placed next to you on a beside table, it doesn't need to have oversized speakers, but the Dreamegg is still loud enough to help drown out other ambient noises that might otherwise keep you awake, like late night conversations, urban fauna their groove on, or music blaring outside.For travellers with babies, this is a near essential device. In my experience, a white noise machine is one of the best ways to keep a baby sleeping, even in noisier environments, and a surefire way to maintain your sanity.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
