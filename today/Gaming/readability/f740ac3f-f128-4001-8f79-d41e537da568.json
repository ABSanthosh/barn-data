  "text": "Sand Land! Battlefield! Soul Hackers 2! Image credit: Sony Sony has revealed the next round of additions to its PS Plus Catalogue for subscribers, which will be added on 20th May. The following games will be available later this month for Premium and Extra subscribers: Sand Land | PS4, PS5 Soul Hackers 2 | PS5 Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted - Full Time Edition | PS4, PS5 Battlefield 5 | PS4 STALKER: Legends of the Zone Trilogy | PS4, PS5 Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising | PS4, PS5 Humankind | PS4, PS5 Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life | PS5 Gloomhaven Mercenaries Edition | PS4, PS5 Additionally, Premium subscribers will get access to PS2 classic Battle Engine Aquila on PS4 and PS5. Action-RPG Sand Land was released last year and features designs from Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama - this was his last game before he passed away. He posthumously praised the game in a statement shared after his death: \"I haven't watched through all of the gameplay yet,\" he said. \"However, it greatly expands the worldview of the original manga with many new exciting elements. It is high-quality as a stand alone game and I can tell it is a highly satisfying action-RPG game!\" Earlier today, GSC Game World announced a free Enhanced Edition upgrade for Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy, which combines the first three games in the series. It includes a visual upgrade and other improvements, but it's unclear if PS Plus subscribers will have access following its inclusion here in the subscription. Elsewhere, Soul Hackers 2 is a 2022 RPG from Persona-maker Atlus that, confusingly, is the fifth installment in the Devil Summoner series, which is part of the Megami Tensei franchise. If you like anime RPGs, Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising is probably also worth a shot, while Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life is a more relaxed farming experience. Are you excited to play any of these? | Image credit: Sony These Catalogue games are in addition to the free monthly games also available this month to those on the Essential tier: Ark: Survival Ascended | PS5 Balatro | PS5, PS4 Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun | PS5, PS4 New additions mean some games will likely be leaving the service this month too, we'll update once we know more. More details on this month's games can be found on the PlayStation Blog. You'll find more details on what else is available in our full PlayStation Plus guide here.",
