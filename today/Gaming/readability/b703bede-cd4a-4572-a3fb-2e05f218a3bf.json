Now that there are many more Pokémon to use, it’s definitely worth reinvestigating what to use against this cruise ship creature.Below, we list out some general Gigantamax Max Battle tips and counters for Gigantamax Lapras in Pokémon Go.Table of ContentsGigantamax Lapras weaknessGigantamax Lapras best countersGeneral Gigantamax Lapras tipsGigantamax Lapras weaknessWe’ll want to utilize Gigantamax Lapras’ weaknesses: fighting-, rock-, grass-, and electric-type moves. Originally, there weren’t too many counters for Lapras available, but now we’re really cooking with gas.You’ll want to avoid using water- and ice-type moves, as Lapras has a resistance against those types.Gigantamax Lapras best countersWith the above in mind, there’s a good number of counters to bring to Lapras. We recommend the following to focus on offensive moves:Gigantamax Rillaboom with Scratch (G-Max Drum Solo)Gigantamax Machamp with Counter (G-Max Chi Strike)Gigantamax Toxtricity with Spark (G-Max Stun Shock)Gigantamax Venusaur with Vine Whip (G-Max Vine Lash)Note that if the Lapras you’re facing off against has Blizzard or Ice Beam as one its moves, your Rillaboom and Venusaur will likely struggle. While Rillaboom will dish out the most damage logically, Machamp or Toxtricity are safer choices when it comes to resisting Lapras’ moves.You can also bring the Dynamax versions of the above Pokémon (though, yes, they will deal less damage than their Gigantamax counterparts), with the same fast moves, with the exception of Dynamax Rillaboom, which will need Razor Leaf. (Since D-Max moves pull typing from the fast move, it’ll want this over Scratch, which we only recommend on G-Max Rillaboom because it’s faster and thus builds up the gauge more.)As a reminder, there is a set of Timed Research that will give you an encounter with a Dynamax Passimian, Passimian Candy, and some particles ahead of the weekend. Dynamax Passimian is a viable counter for Lapras, but we would only recommend investing in and using it if you don’t have many Max-eligible Pokémon to begin with.If you want to be an ally to your team, you can bring the following Pokémon with Max Guard and/or Max Spirit to help out defensively:Dynamax Blissey with PoundCrowned Shield Zamazenta with Metal ClawGigantamax Lapras with Water GunThese moves will allow you to build up shields quickly, and they resist most of Lapras’ possible moves.Even if you don’t have these powered up, consider just bringing the strongest Dynamax Pokémon you have. If you have a maxed out Dynamax Gengar and your Dynamax Venusaur isn’t leveled (and you don’t have the means to power it up), just bring your Gengar.General Gigantamax Lapras tipsIf you’ve been struggling in Max Battles, here’s some general tips to survive — and make sure you’re an asset to your team. Gigantamax battles involve way more strategy than the usual rampant tapping that you do in raids, so make sure to know what you’re doing before jumping in.Make sure you have enough players. High-efficiency groups with maxed out investments can take down the Lapras with fewer people, but practically, if you don’t have hundreds of spare candy and even more Stardust laying around, this isn’t going to be an option for you. Make sure you have as many people as possible to ensure that you get your musically inclined cruise ship-shell creature.Don’t sleep on Max Spirit and Max Guard. Teams work best when there’s a variety of moves, not just maxed-out attacks. Each player should bring Pokémon with the defensive and healing moves unlocked as well. Max Guard will focus single-target damage towards you and reduce the damage taken and Max Spirit will heal the whole party, so these moves are really important to make sure your damage-dealers can keep dishing.Remember to swap to super effective moves when it’s time to Dynamax. For Dynamax Pokémon, their max moves will be whatever type their fast move is. This means if you have a Rillaboom with Razor Leaf, it will know Max Overgrowth. A Gengar with Shadow Claw will know Max Phantasm. Take advantage of this and make sure to swap to a Pokémon that will deal super effective damage to your target before Dynamaxing, if you can.Level up a few ‘mons, but you don’t have to go too hard. Depending on your group size, you absolutely do not need to max out all your Dynamax Pokémon to level 40-50. While this will make it easier on the rest of your group, if this isn’t an investment you can make, you don’t have to stress about it. Power things up as high as you can afford to, but don’t fret if you don’t have a maxed out Pokémon.That all being said, make sure to come as prepared as you can be. This is a team effort and there’s a reason why groups of 30-40 people can still fail. Do not just bring your unleveled Dynamax Wooloo expecting a free ride to a powerful Pokémon. (After all, if everyone does that, then you certainly won’t clear the battle.) Again, you don’t have to completely max out your Pokémon, but it will be better for everyone involved if you bring something helpful to the table.Keep your eye out for a shiny Lapras! If you clear the raid, there is a chance that the Lapras you catch will be shiny — which also means it’ll be a guaranteed catch. Use a Pinap Berry to score extra candy if you get lucky enough to find a sparkly Lapras.Graphic: Julia Lee/Polygon | Source images: Niantic",
