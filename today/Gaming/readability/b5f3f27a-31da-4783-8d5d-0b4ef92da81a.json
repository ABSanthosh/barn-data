Festival Playlist. A track day is not a track day without a speedy companion to rush through corners in, or to floor its gas pedal on straights. This time, the Festival Playlist reward cars feature a collection of some of the finest, modern Porsches you are going to want to unlock and take on a beautiful tour of every track available at the Horizon Festival. 2023 Porsche 911 GT3 RS Earn 20 PTS during Week 1 “Summer” Season on the Horizon Track Day Festival Playlist. Available from November 7 until November 14. The best bits of the 911 cranked up to 11 create a performance focused version of one of the world’s favorite GT racers: the 2023 Porsche 911 GT3 RS, a superb partner for any track day. The highly exclusive GT3 RS comes with a 4-liter six-cylinder engine that produces 518 bhp and reaches 100 kph in just beyond 3 seconds. Porsche’s engineering masterminds brought ideas birthed in F1 and other racing divisions into the GT3 RS as seen on the adjustable rear wing and turbo body that allows maximum airflow and 88 pounds more downforce. Every material found in this car, including the windows, is lightweight and its design with dynamic aerodynamics makes the most out of an already great engine. From its conception, the GT3 RS was built to become the king of the track. 2023 Porsche 911 Rallye Earn 20 PTS during Week 2 “Autumn” Season on the Horizon Track Day Festival Playlist. Available from November 14 until November 21. Who said tracks were tarmac only? Not the 2023 Porsche 911 Rallye. This car has all the bits and pieces that make 911s great, and an amazing rally modification package. The rally modifications start with a new suspension that has been lifted around 2 inches and can be lifted 1.2 more if needed. New Pirelli Scorpion tires were fitted into the Rallye to improve performance on rough terrain and to resist punctures among other inconveniences that arise with off roading adventures. According to Porsche, this car can reach 100 kph in just over 3 seconds and has a top speed of 241 kph all thanks to a mighty twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter flat-six engine:, the same one you can find on a Carrera GTS. Nothing makes a track day better than spending quality time with our friend dirt. Unlock the 911 Rallye and take on a wildly different concept of a track! 2023 Porsche 911 GT3 R Earn 20 PTS during Week 3 “Winter” Season on the Horizon Track Day Festival Playlist. Available from November 21 until November 28. Who’s ready for some endurance racing? What better way to spend a track day than going round and round the Oval Track Stadium in a car designed to be taken to the limit:, the 2023 Porsche 911 GT3 R. The engine fitted in this car had a growth spurt over the summer and is now a 4.2-liter flat-six, direct injection engine that can put out 565 bhp. To make the most of this engine, Porsche made the car lighter using carbon fiber panels and an aluminum-steel body,; and improved its handling with fifth-generation ABS software, an elevated underbody, and traction control system upgrades. The GT3 R is not only here to run, but also here to steal the gold, whatever it takes. 2023 Porsche 911 Turbo S Complete Seasonal Championship “50 Years of Porsche 911 Turbo” during Week 4 “Spring” Season on the Horizon Track Day Festival Playlist. Available from November 28 until December 5.The “Turbo” part in the 2023 Porsche 911 Turbo S’s name is not there just for show. This car can take down a quarter-mile race in just 9.9 seconds, all thanks to a 3.7-liter flat-six engine that can produce 640 horsepower and a fantastic all-wheel drive system that puts every horse to work on each wheel of the car. As we all know, performance isn’t just about horsepower (although that part is really fun) it is also how good a car can handle around corners, which the Turbo S can do fantastically. Its lower chassis, dampers, and helper springs make driving this car through corners an experience of its own. It might be packed to the brim with nice seats, connectivity, and more comfort options on its inside, but do not judge this car wrongly, or you might stare at its rear-lights all day on the track.

This car can take down a quarter-mile race in just 9.9 seconds, all thanks to a 3.7-liter flat-six engine that can produce 640 horsepower and a fantastic all-wheel drive system that puts every horse to work on each wheel of the car.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we all know, performance isn’t just about horsepower (although that part is really fun) it is also how good a car can handle around corners, which the Turbo S can do fantastically. Its lower chassis, dampers, and helper springs make driving this car through corners an experience of its own.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might be packed to the brim with nice seats, connectivity, and more comfort options on its inside, but do not judge this car wrongly, or you might stare at its rear-lights all day on the track. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch2\u003eVote for Your Favorite Creations in this Year’s Golden Tank Awards!\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure category=\"horizon\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe moment you have been waiting for, the day in which we celebrate the creations of our community has arrived: it’s time for the 2024 Golden Tank Awards. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike last year, our team will create a shortlist of nominees for each of the categories available.
