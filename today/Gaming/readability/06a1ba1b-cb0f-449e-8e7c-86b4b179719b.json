We’re going to tell you how to start and complete every single one in this All Roblox Beaks Quests Guide.

All Benny Beaks Quests in Roblox Beaks Screenshot by The Escapist When you first start playing the game, you’ll be at Beakwoods Camp. On the Right of the sign, you should see Benny Beaks, who has a few tutorial quests for you. Even if you already have a high-level character in Beaks, you should still do these because they take less than a few minutes, and they give you a bunch of darts. You have to finish these in order. Capture 10 birds Quest Screenshot by The Escapist Just like it sounds. Equip your gun and capture 10 birds. Any will do, so feel free to capture 10 Pidgeons or 10 Parrots, which are all over the place. Go back and talk to Benny when you’ve captured 10. Reward: 50 Coins, 20 XP The Bird Collector Screenshot by The Escapist After catching your 10 birds, Benny tells you to sell them to the Bird Collector. Walk up to the Bird Bazaar NPC (it’s just next to you), and ask to sell all your birds (or if you want to keep a few, just sell 10). Return to Benny for your reward. Reward: 50 Coins, 20 XP The Dartsmith Screenshot by The Escapist This is actually a great way to see how the Beaks developers reworked the Dartsmith. Before the update, you had to pay 200 Coins to get around 4-5 random darts. Now, you can pick the darts you need, and buy them in sets from just one to up to 10. Visit the Dartsmith who is next to the notice board and craft any dart. We recommend you get 10 Iron Darts, but you only really need one for the quest. Return to Benny for your reward. Reward: 15 Steel Darts, 100 Coins, 25 XP The Gunsmith Screenshot by The Escapist This one can take a few minutes. You need to have 1,500 Coins to buy the Hunter Rifle from the Gunsmith at Beakwoods. So, go into the field and start gunning down birds and then selling them to the Bird Collector. This is a great way to learn the loop of the game. Once you have 1,500 Coins, buy the gun from the Gunsmith. Return to Benny for your reward. Now, if you already bought the Hunter Rifle before the quest was added, simply talk to the Gunsmith, then unequip and equip the Hunter Rifle again. You won’t get the progress, but with your Hunter Rifle equipped, talk to Benny, and that should finish the quest. Reward: 30 Steel Darts, 20 Smoke Darts, 300 Coins, 100 XP All Jimmy Quests in Roblox Beaks Screenshot by The Escapist Jimmy is the innocent-looking NPC just outside Beakwoods camp (on your way to Quill Lake). He has a few quests that further teach you about different kinds of birds. Jimmy’s First Quest! Screenshot by The Escapist Jimmy wants you to collect 5 common and 2 uncommon birds. You’ve probably already figured out that birds like Parrots and Pigeons are really common, while Bulbuls, Sparrows, and Goldflinches are somewhat uncommon (but you really shouldn’t have a problem finding two of them). Once you capture the birds, talk to Jimmy for your reward and next quest. Reward: 50 Coins, 25 XP Beakwood’s Rare Birds! Screenshot by The Escapist Jimmy wants you to catch 3 rare birds. Rare birds (in Beakwoods) include: Crossbills, Woodpeckers, and Hummingbirds. Out of all of these, Crossbills and Hummingbirds are the easiest to notice. Just look for anything blue flying around or anything red flying somewhat high. If you can’t see them right away, try to shoot some common birds until these rare ones eventually spawn. It shouldn’t take you too long. Return to Jimmy for your reward and one more quest. Reward: 75 Coins, 50 XP Beakwood’s Mutated Birds! Screenshot by The Escapist Jimmy wants you to capture 3 mutated birds in Beakwoods. These can be of any rarity, so even 3 mutated Pidgeons are good. For this one, just look for any bird with weird colors or glowing eyes and gun it down. It shouldn’t take you much longer than the Rare Birds quest. Once you gun down the 3 mutated birds, report to Jimmy for your reward. Reward: 30 Smoke Darts, 75 Coins, 50 XP All Moon Quests in Roblox Beaks Screenshot by The Escapist Just before you arrive at the Quill Lake sign, you should spot Moon the Beakwoods Guardian. Moon’s Quest Screenshot by The Escapist Moon wants you to complete the Beakwoods bestiary. Honestly, out of all bestiaries, the Beakwoods one is likely the easiest. Simply shoot birds until you fill it out (don’t forget about the birds that fly high above the trees) and return to Moon. Reward: 25 Smoke Darts, 20 Golden Darts, 250 Coins, 100 XP All Star Quests in Roblox Beaks Screenshot by The Escapist When you reach Quill Lake, you can find Star (Quill Guardian) standing on one of the elevated piers. She actually gives you a choice between two quests, and you can even repeat one (but you probably shouldn’t). Lake Birds Screenshot by The Escapist Getting into some tougher quests. What you need to do is complete the Quill Lake Bestiary. Refer to our Roblox Beaks All Birds Guide for a list of all birds in the game. When you have the full bestiary, return to Star, and you can then accept the other quest. We recommend you pair this quest with other ones (such as Garden of Eden) because it can take a while. Reward: 25 Golden Darts, 20 Smoke Darts, 20 Steel Darts, 25 Iron Darts, 1,000 Coins, 500 XP The Wishing Well Screenshot by The Escapist This one is entirely luck-dependent. You need to use a regular bird on a Wishing Well and (hopefully) get the Bio-Luminous mutation on this same bird. Refer to our Ultimate Roblox Beaks Beginner’s Guide to learn where the Wishing Well is. Essentially, grab any common bird (a Swan worked for us) and dunk them until you get the Bio-Luminous Mutation. Needless to say, this can take a while, so just be patient and if you get bored, just go and do something else. It’s RNG after all. Note: this quest is repeatable (for some reason) Reward: No reward (because reasons) All Laken Quests in Roblox Beaks Screenshot by The Escapist Find Laken in Quill Lake, who is just under the Camp NPC. Garden of Eden You need to capture 10 vibrant birds that reflect the beauty of nature. What the game actually means is that it wants 10 birds with nature-like mutations. These are the Cherry and the Mossy Mutation. This can take a while, so we recommend you pair it with the All Vito Quests in Roblox Beaks Screenshot by The Escapist Vito the Quill Lake Veteran is stationed in Silverstone Camp (the place where you can get the Night and Thermal Vision Goggles). Big Birds of Quill Vito’s first quest is for you to capture bigger birds. Pretty much, anything bigger than a Swan is considered a big bird on Quill Lake. So go and hunt down Flamingos, Storks, Sandhill Cranes, Pelicans, and Great Egrets. This shouldn’t take you too long. Reward: 750 Coins, 500 XP The Wishing Well (Vito) Screenshot by The Escapist After you finish the quest above, Vito wants you to “sacrifice” a bird to the Wishing Well, so go and do just that. Simply put ANY bird into the wishing well, and once it comes back, you’ll get the progress. Simple as that. Reward: 100 Coins, 75 XP Double Trouble Screenshot by The Escapist Vito wants you to capture 5 different species of birds, each with two different mutations. Honestly, just do this one as you do any other quest because you should get it naturally. We recommend you just shoot everything at Quill Lake, and eventually you should have all of them. You can also just go for the common birds like Swans, Black Swans, Ducks, Parrots, and Pidgeons and just focus on them until you capture two versions of each. Reward: 25 Smoke Darts, 25 Claw Darts, 15 Longshot Darts, 750 Coins All Alex Quests in Roblox Beaks Screenshot by The Escapist Alex the Wanderer is an NPC on the cliff above the Mount Beaks campsite. Eye on the Skies Screenshot by The Escapist Alex wants you to buy your first set of binoculars. You can buy Binoculars from the Glider merchant. Night Vision Goggles or the Thermal Vision Goggles do not count as Binoculars (we thought we could get away with them). A regular pair of Binoculars costs 1,500 Coins, and an Advanced pair of Binoculars goes for 2,500. You only need the basic ones. Buy it and take it back to Alex for your reward. Reward: 100 Coins, 50 XP A Small Ask! Screenshot by The Escapist Alex wants you to capture 10 small birds at Mt Beaks. Believe it or not, this actually isn’t that straightforward. Most Mountain Beaks birds are huge and fly really high. Only occasionally can you see the really tiny birds, and they tend to stick low. So simply aim around the trees until you spot them. These include birds like the Chickadee, the Mountain Bluebird, the Brown Creeper, and the Snowfinch. Once you capture 10 small birds, report to Alex for your reward. Reward: 25 Claw Darts, 50 Longshot Darts, 250 Coin, 100 XP Spot gold in the sky! Screenshot by The Escapist So, here’s a ridiculous one. You need to capture 10 (or 5) high-flying birds with a Golden or Gold-spotted mutation. Here’s where we would post info on how to do it… IF WE HAD ANY! The quest is bugged. Yep, we took down several Golden and Gold-Spotted birds that were definitely flying high, but none of them counted towards the progression. Many other players have been complaining about this, so it’s only a matter of time before it’s fixed. It also seems like this quest is preventing further quest progression. Reward: 50 Golden Darts, 25 Crystal Darts, 500 Coins, 250 XP Those are all the quests we have so far. We’ll keep updating the list as we discover the rest.

You can also just go for the \u003cstrong\u003ecommon birds like Swans, Black Swans, Ducks, Parrots, and Pidgeons \u003c/strong\u003eand just focus on them until you capture two versions of each.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    \u003cp data-characters=\"67\" data-current-count=\"67\" data-injectable=\"false\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReward:\u003c/strong\u003e 25 Smoke Darts, 25 Claw Darts, 15 Longshot Darts, 750 Coins\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"h-all-alex-quests-in-roblox-beaks\" data-injectable=\"false\"\u003eAll Alex Quests in Roblox Beaks\u003c/h2\u003e    \u003cfigure data-current-count=\"367\" data-injectable=\"false\"\u003e\u003cimg data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.escapistmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Alex-Beaks.jpg?w=1024\u0026amp;resize=1200%2C675\" alt=\"A Beaks player is talking to  the Alex NPC\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eScreenshot by The Escapist\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e    \u003cp data-characters=\"72\" data-current-count=\"439\" data-injectable=\"true\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlex the Wanderer \u003c/strong\u003eis an NPC on the cliff \u003cstrong\u003eabove the Mount Beaks campsite\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    \u003ch3 id=\"h-eye-on-the-skies\" data-injectable=\"false\"\u003eEye on the Skies\u003c/h3\u003e    \u003cfigure data-current-count=\"300\" data-injectable=\"false\"\u003e\u003cimg data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.escapistmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Buying-Binoculars-Beaks.jpg?w=1024\u0026amp;resize=1200%2C675\" alt=\"A Beaks player is about to buy Binoculars\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eScreenshot by The Escapist\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e    \u003cp data-characters=\"398\" data-current-count=\"698\" data-injectable=\"true\"\u003eAlex wants you to \u003cstrong\u003ebuy your first set of binoculars\u003c/strong\u003e.

So simply \u003cstrong\u003eaim around the trees\u003c/strong\u003e until you spot them. These include birds like the \u003cstrong\u003eChickadee, the Mountain Bluebird, the Brown Creeper, and the Snowfinch\u003c/strong\u003e.

Here’s where we would post info on how to do it… IF WE HAD ANY! \u003cstrong\u003eThe quest is bugged\u003c/strong\u003e. Yep, we took down several Golden and Gold-Spotted birds that were definitely flying high, but none of them counted towards the progression.
