Roll the katamari to make it bigger and bigger, rolling up all the things on the earth. You can roll up anything from paper clips and snacks in the house, to telephone poles and buildings in the town, to even living creatures such as people and animals. Once the katamari is complete, it will turn into a star that colors the night sky. You cannot roll up anything larger than the current size of your katamari, so the key is to think in advance about the order in which you roll things up around the stage.

You’re stranded on an abandoned space station chock-full of monsters and mysteries. To get out you’ll have to reach The Core, but you can’t do that without your crystal bot. That scuttling critter is your key to surviving the procedurally generated rooms of this space ruin. Sadly, it’s also a fragile soul, and every monster in the place wants a piece of it. You’re going to have to think quick, plan well, place your turrets, and then… fireworks! Bugs, bots and blobs will stop at nothing to turn you and that crystal into dust and debris. With a large choice of weapons and turrets, the right gear will be the difference between life and death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlayStation Plus Premium\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/06/4e8160e4cc75dcfba4e93c696348de511af5aa65.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/06/4e8160e4cc75dcfba4e93c696348de511af5aa65.jpg?fit=1024%2C576\u0026amp;zoom=1 1024w, https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/06/4e8160e4cc75dcfba4e93c696348de511af5aa65.jpg?fit=1024%2C576\u0026amp;zoom=0.99 1014w, https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/06/4e8160e4cc75dcfba4e93c696348de511af5aa65.jpg?fit=1024%2C576\u0026amp;zoom=0.75 768w, https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/06/4e8160e4cc75dcfba4e93c696348de511af5aa65.jpg?fit=1024%2C576\u0026amp;zoom=0.61 625w, https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/06/4e8160e4cc75dcfba4e93c696348de511af5aa65.jpg?fit=1024%2C576\u0026amp;zoom=0.49 502w, https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/06/4e8160e4cc75dcfba4e93c696348de511af5aa65.jpg?fit=1024%2C576\u0026amp;zoom=0.41 420w, https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/06/4e8160e4cc75dcfba4e93c696348de511af5aa65.jpg?fit=1024%2C576\u0026amp;zoom=0.32 328w, https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/06/4e8160e4cc75dcfba4e93c696348de511af5aa65.jpg?fit=1024%2C576\u0026amp;zoom=0.25 256w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1170px) 936px, (min-width: 960px) 80vw, 100vw\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeus Ex: The Conspiracy | PS4, PS5\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is an emulation of the classic PS2 title, Deus Ex: The Conspiracy, playable on PS4 and PS5 for the first time. The year is 2052 and the world is a dangerous and chaotic place. Terrorists operate openly – killing thousands; drugs, disease and pollution kill even more. The world’s economies are close to collapse and the gap between the insanely wealthy and the desperately poor grows ever wider. Worst of all, an age- old conspiracy bent on world domination has decided that the time is right to emerge from the shadows and take control. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e*PlayStation Plus Game Catalog and PlayStation Plus Premium/Deluxe lineups may differ by region.
