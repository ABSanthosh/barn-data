  "text": "It’s time to settle some Unfinished Business. This standalone game picks up where RoboCop Rogue City left off. Though it’s not required to play (or own) RoboCop Rogue City before getting into Unfinished Business, you’re more than welcome to. Unfinished Business starts with a group of mercenaries tearing into the Metro West precinct, leaving after stealing components from RoboCop’s medical chair and making off for OCP’s latest project, the OmniTower. Welcome to the OmniTower The OmniTower is a massive housing complex designed to house residents evicted from their homes in Old Detroit to make way for Delta City. This tower is also a potential power source that, when combined with those stolen components, could give the mercenaries access to all OCP’s technology, including RoboCop. Pulling this plan off will take time, so they’ve seized control of the tower, turning each floor into a dangerous maze of enemies, traps, and bullets. One that you’ll need to contend with.   As you ascend the tower, ghosts from Alex Murphy’s past will come back to haunt him. The leader of the mercenaries is a former colleague of Murphy. These two have the same goal, protecting Old Detroit, but their motives differ. A change in gameplay It’s the appearance of this old friend that triggers something within Murphy, causing him to remember events from his past. As seen in the classic films, these moments are core for the development of RoboCop’s character, and we wanted to capture that in Unfinished Business. During a flashback sequence, you’ll play Alex Murphy when he was a beat cop in Old Detroit. Playing as RoboCop can make you feel like a walking tank, powerful and indestructible. That’s a far cry from when you’re playing as Alex Murphy, after all, taking one too many bullets got him turned into RoboCop in the first place. You’ll need to be careful, taking advantage of the terrain and keeping cover between you and your opponents as you fulfill your duties to the precinct. But wait, there’s more! While tackling the OmniTower, you will be aided by Miranda Hale, a former OCP scientist who worked on the RoboCop project before being ousted so Bob Morton could take the credit. For a while, Miranda worked alongside the mercenaries. But disagreements in their approach caused her to sever ties with them. Regretting what she’d done, she teams up with RoboCop to atone for her mistakes.  In addition to RoboCop and Alex Murphy, you will have the opportunity to play as Miranda and others throughout the story of Unfinished Business. These vignettes will delve deeper into the story, giving you a better understanding of how far people are willing to go for their ideals and how if RoboCop ends up coming for you, then perhaps you’ve gone too far. A love letter to the series We’re huge fans of RoboCop; the opportunity to tell these stories, work with Peter Weller, and to add to the universe of RoboCop is an indescribable honor. Beyond that, we’ve been constantly floored by the amazing response from fans across the world. We wouldn’t be able to create this standalone without your support and hope you enjoy your experience tackling the OmniTower.RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business will be coming to PlayStation 5 July 17 and you can download the game now as a April 2025 PlayStation Plus Monthly Game. Also, we’re happy to note that Peter Weller will again reprise his role for this standalone! Trending Stories",
