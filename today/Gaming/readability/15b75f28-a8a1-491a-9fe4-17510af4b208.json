Two years later, the game has free DLC. Throes of the Watchmaker, which includes a new collectible called Time Pieces. While Time Pieces are an entirely optional new item as you explore the clockwork circus of Horloge, they’re necessary to see and unlock everything the 8-10 hour DLC has to offer. If you want to acquire all 12 Time Runes, here’s how to find each of them. All Time Rune Locations In Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker An important thing to note is that while you’re searching throughout Horloge for the Time Runes, you most likely will not be collecting them in order. Some of these Time Runes are discovered naturally, while others will force you to engage in side quests or go to optional areas. With that in mind, here’s how to find all 12 Time Runes in Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker! Time Rune #1: Found in Horloge in the southwest corner of town. You’ll have to defeat the three Wheels players to earn it. In order to challenge them, you must first find the Warlock figurine, which can be acquired in Were-Lake. However, in order to get it, you must have collected one of each type of Goodie Bag from the three lakes in Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker. Time Rune #2: In Goodies Pond behind the waterfall. Time Rune #3: In Rail Forest. After grappling onto the wall midway through the level, search the eastern side of the area until you find a hidden puzzle room. Time Rune #4: Outside of Ivory Towers in the overworld. Time Rune #5: In Ivory Towers, before entering the fourth tower, head south until you see a door. Enter it, then solve the light puzzle (you’ll have to make a shadow in the face of the Puppeteer to solve it). Time Rune #6: In Horloge, solve the sliding block puzzle in the northeast of town (you’ll need to have completed Ivory Towers to access it). Time Rune #7: To the east of Goodies Pond. Time Rune #8: In Wolf Rock, after crossing the bridge, enter the cave to the east. Time Rune #9: In Horloge, complete the combat challenge in the eastern tent. Time Rune #10: To the north of Goodies Pond (you’ll need to have completed Ivory Towers to access it). Time Rune #11: At the Big Top, after defeating Pantouf, find a small cave in the upper room to the right. Time Rune #12: Complete Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker. Once you’ve collected all 12 Time Runes, make your way to the giant clock in Horlege, insert them all into the clock, and watch the secret cutscene play! Now you’ve fully completed the DLC! Sea of Stars is now available on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Steam. The Escapist is supported by our audience.
