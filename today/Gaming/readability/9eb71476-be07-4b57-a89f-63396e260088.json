The set also comes with 13 DLC add-ons for the game, including two additional playable characters.It's a bit humorous that this collection is available at Best Buy, because the retailer stopped carrying Blu-rays this year.While this is a cool collection for fans of the game and the original movie, if you're only looking to own the movie, you can instead pick up The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 4K Steelbook for $33 (down from $55) at Amazon. This is essentially the same version of the film bundled in with the 50th Anniversary Collection, though the steelbook isn't as cool. However, the 40th Anniversary Black Maria Limited Edition is pretty darn cool, as the 4K and 1080p discs are housed in a replica of the Black Maria semi-truck from the movie. Remarkably, it's still in stock, and Amazon has discounted this five-disc set to $70 (was $100).The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 40th Anniversary Black Maria EditionThis replica Black Maria truck comes with the five-disc 40th Anniversary Limited Edition from 2014For more horror movie steelbooks and collector's box sets, check out our roundup of the best Blu-ray deals at Amazon ahead of Halloween.Back to the game: Our Texas Chain Saw Massacre review gave it an impressive 9/10, praising it for its intricate map design and rewarding gameplay that pushes you to experiment with your play style.\"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre plays, looks, and sounds like its team holds the source material in the highest regard,\" wrote critic Mark Delaney. \"Faithfully transposing the film's signature terror into a modern multiplayer game is a feat on both ends.
