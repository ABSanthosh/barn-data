The PlayStation Network Service page also shows that all services, from sing-in to gaming to the PlayStation Store are all down. It's unclear when services will resume for PSN, but the outage means that this weekend begins without access to some of your favorite games including Marvel Rivals, Call of Duty, Fortnite, and more. We'll have an update for when services resume. In the meantime, no other platforms are reporting outages so it appears specific to PSN.Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.",
