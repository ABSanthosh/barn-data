Let’s save the goodbyes for a few days more, and in the meantime, simply share what we’re all playing this weekend. Edwin I've been ill this week and am still feeling a bit stinky, so I'll have a quiet weekend, I reckon. I'm going to re-watch L.A. Confidential for the first time in two decades, and I have a compulsion to play the original Thief. I do love the City and its cults. Or perhaps I'll jump forward to Deadly Shadows and the Shalebridge Cradle. James I’m supposed to be playing Killing Floor 3 for review, but headshot fatigue is setting in fast. For relief, I find myself oddly drawn towards Wheel World – while I’m not a real-life bicyclist, the idea piloting a speedy mechano-glide machine appeals a lot more when it lacks the risk of colliding with the no. 25 to Ilford. Ollie Is probably somewhere around here, I dunno. Nic Going to play with my cat. Videogames are awful. Might play some Total War: Warhammer 3 but I WILL NOT enjoy it. Jeremy My gaming rotation continues to be Final Fantasy XII on the Steam Deck before bed (I'm still loving the auto-battling Gambit system), Gotham Knights for breaks either during lunch or immediately after work (I have definitely enjoyed playing as Red Hood, but perhaps a switch to Batgirl is in order), and finally Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, which has become the game that I need to concentrate on during desk hours (hey, check out our boss guide). Three ongoing games is the maximum that I can sustain at once, and I'm really only able to justify this because I'm being paid to play Wuchang. As you can see, I divide my gaming time by device and what's required for leisure time/work in order to fit it all in, which is the only viable way to go about things. Anyone else follow a similar strategy? Brendy Is... hanging out with Ollie? Maybe? Graham This is my final WAP because I'm leaving RPS this coming Wednesday, so here is a final entry to stand in perpetuity: I have no ungodly idea what I'll be playing this weekend and never do, because I decide on a whim every time I open my computer. (Except for Dune: Imperium, which I am never not playing.) My hat is off to any of you in the comments whose playing habits are more ordered, and I'll continue to read your posts each week with interest. Farewell! And you, reader dear, what are you playing this weekend?...",
