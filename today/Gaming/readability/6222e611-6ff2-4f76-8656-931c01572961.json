  "text": "Ahead of April's release. Image credit: Capcom If the thrill of bopping Monster Hunter Wilds' base game menagerie is starting to fade, you'll no doubt be wanting to know what's next for Capcom's latest mega-hit. And following a couple of previous teases, the publisher has now confirmed it'll be fully detailing Wilds' first major content update next Tuesday, 25th March. Capcom's latest Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase - the first since last month's launch - begins at 2pm in the UK/7am PT over on Twitch. It'll be hosted by producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and is set delve into Monster Hunter Wilds' first free Title Update (as Capcom likes to call these things), which is scheduled to arrive in \"early April\". We do, of course, already have a fairly good idea of what Title Update 1 will bring thanks to Capcom's previous chatter. It's set to introduce everybody's favourite bubble dragon Mizutsune, for instance, as well as a \"new place\" for hunters to gather once they've completed the main story - so presumably the sort of centralised (and hopefully arm-wrestling enabled) social gathering hub we've seen in previous Monster Hunter games. Monster Hunter Wilds Review Here's our Monster Hunter Wilds review in video form.Watch on YouTube And finally in terms of earlier teases, Capcom's also previously discussed a \"new level of challenge\" for Wilds - one that'll manifest as a monster of \"formidable strength\" somewhere above the tougher Tempered variants currently found in-game. That's good news for everyone who (like me, in my four star review) felt Wilds' difficulty skewed a little low at launch. Expect the remaining Title Update 1 blanks to be filled (and hopefully some news on much-needed performance improvements) in Monster Hunter Wilds' showcase next week. To recap, things kick off next Tuesday, 25th March, at 2pm in the UK. And in the meantime, Capcom's got a full schedule of in-game events to keep you occupied.",
