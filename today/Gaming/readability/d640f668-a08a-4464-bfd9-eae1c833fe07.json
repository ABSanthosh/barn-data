Movie starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo, many wondered if Nintendo would ever again attempt to make a Mario movie. Well, 30 years later, the company partnered with Minions studio Illumination to do just that--and the movie is off to a fantastic start. Released on April 5, 2023 the movie quickly earned $377 million worldwide over its first five days and rapidly cleared more than $500 million. It's now earned more than $1.3 billion.

Director Ruben Fleischer has said he's game for a sequel and has even outlined some of his ideas for a follow-up, including putting Uncharted 4's epic car chase set piece into a potential Uncharted 2.Domestic – $148,648,820International – $258,492,438Worldwide – $407,141,258 8: Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022)Sonic the Hedgehog 2 released in April 2022 and has become a quick success.

The film was partly inspired by Crystal Dynamics\u0026#39; 2013 reboot, telling an origin story for the character. Croft is trying to solve the mystery of her father\u0026#39;s (Dominic West) disappearance. The film also starred Walton Goggins, Daniel Wu, and Kristin Scott Thomas. The movie made the bulk of its money ($216.4 million; 78.8%) from international markets, with just $58.25 million from the US. A sequel is now said to be in the works, but whether or not it ever gets made remains to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDomestic – \u003cstrong\u003e$58,250,803\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli dir=\"ltr\"\u003eInternational – \u003cstrong\u003e$216,400,000\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWorldwide – \u003cstrong\u003e$274,650,803\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e    \n          \n    \n  \u003c/article\u003e\n                      \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
