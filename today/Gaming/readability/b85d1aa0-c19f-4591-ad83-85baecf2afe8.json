Introducing the Xbox Insider Badges We’re thrilled to announce a new way to recognize and reward our dedicated Insiders. We’re rolling out gold, silver, and bronze badges for excellent participation! These badges are the ultimate achievement and will be awarded to those who consistently go above and beyond! These badges will be rare, but anyone can earn these badges with good participation. Keep joining playtests, completing activities, posting on the subreddit, and submitting excellent feedback Gold Badge Spotlight The Gold badge represents the highest level of recognition in the Xbox Insider Program. In this first round, we’re proud to honor bowski477, aka Scratch, WPAK, and others—our dedicated subreddit moderators—whose leadership and commitment have meaningfully shaped and supported the Insider community. We asked our winners a few questions: What’s a comfort game you can always go back to and enjoy playing, and why? Bowski477 For me it’s Minecraft. There’s no pressure, it’s simple, and the music is soothing. There’s always something new to create and discover. WPAK A game I have been going back to for years is Civilization. I only do single player, so no time pressure and it brings me back to my younger self. If you could live in any video game world, which one would it be and why? aka Scratch Probably Minecraft so I could explore and live in a world of floating half trees. Silver Badge Spotlight Longtime contributors to the Xbox Insider Program, Mikro, CID, and Joern have earned the Silver badge for their sustained dedication and impact. Their feedback, testing, and community engagement continue to help shape the future of Xbox. If you could have any video game character as your best friend, who would it be? Mikro Ooo The Master Chief of course, Halo. What’s the funniest glitch or bug you’ve encountered in a game? CID Seeing infinite ladder glitches in games like The Division or finding out that you could fly due to a ladder glitch in the game Raft. Plenty of random funky situations and experiences. Some of the most entertaining experiences can come from those unexpected “instances” when gaming. Always a good time to randomly be thrown into outer limits spontaneously when greeting another player.” What’s the most challenging game you have ever played, and did you beat it? Joern Even though it’s been almost 20 years, I still remember playing Call of Duty 2 on veteran difficulty on the Xbox 360. This feels like the hardest game, yet I beat it.” Bronze Badge Spotlight The Bronze badge recognizes Insiders who have shown consistent involvement and enthusiasm throughout their time in the program. For this first round of bronze badges, we want to recognize: “KJ” and deadeagleman! Both have been resolute Insiders who have contributed to the program in a meaningful way. Have you ever pulled an all-nighter playing a game? If so, what game? “KJ“ All night game list is very long Deadeagleman Yes, elite dangerous, long grind for the corvette ship in the game You’ve Earned XP for Providing Feedback! In addition to the new badges, we are excited to officially announce that we’ve been awarding Xbox Insider XP for the valuable feedback you provide! While this is the first time we’re talking about it, we have been recognizing your contributions with XP for some time now. Your insights are crucial in helping us improve, and we want to ensure you know how much we appreciate them. While the badges are rare, your feedback and participation can still earn you XP. The better your feedback is, the more likely it is to be awarded XP, so be sure to provide detailed, clear feedback and include screenshots when you can.
