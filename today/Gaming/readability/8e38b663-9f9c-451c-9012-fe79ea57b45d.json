Put your order in sooner than later because, unless HP has readily available 5090 GPUs in its inventory (unlikely), these prebuilts will probably have a bit of a lead time before they ship out.Preorder the HP Omen 45L RTX 5090 Prebuilt Gaming PCFirst Configurable HP Omen 45L RTX 5090 Prebuilt Gaming PCFollow these instructions – you must add these upgrades to proceed to cart:Click HereSelect Graphics Card - Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 (+$1,750)Select Processor - Intel Core Ultra 9 285K (+$170)Select Memory - Kingston Fury 64GB DDR5-5600 (+$210)Select Storage - 2 TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe M.2 SSD (+$200)Select Chassis \u0026 Power Supply - Front Bezel Black Glass and 1200W PSU (+$100)Proceed to shopping cartYour total should be $4,729.99 shipped (plus taxes)The RTX 5090 Is the Most Powerful Graphics Card EverThe Nvidia 50-series GPUs were officially announced at CES 2025. The emphasis for this round of cards has been on the new and improved AI features over hardware-based raster performance. DLSS 4 technology supposedly quadruples the number of frames with minimal visual compromise. These new GPUs do offer a modest performance boost, but opinions are mixed regarding their value for PC gamers relative to the previous generation RTX 40-series cards.In our Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 FE review, Jackie Thomas wrote that \"the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 has officially taken the performance crown from the RTX 4090, but with less force than previous generations. When it comes to traditional non-AI gaming performance, the RTX 5090 provides one of the smallest generational uplifts in recent memory. However, in games that support it, DLSS 4 really does deliver huge performance gains – you just have to make your peace with the fact that 75% of the frames are generated with AI.\"Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
