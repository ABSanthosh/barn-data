  "text": "Image: AppleIf you haven’t made The Severance Podcast with Ben Stiller \u0026 Adam Scott part of your weekday schedule, you’re missing out on Severance Easter eggs that could alter your perception of some of the show’s most memorable moments. After revealing that Apple didn’t want Adam Scott on the show, and that the original pilot script had Helly R’s and Mark S’s origin stories flipped, executive producer/director Stiller now explains how the famous dance sequence in the first season caught more than the audience off guard.Suggested ReadingLive Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'Suggested ReadingIn the seventh episode of the first season, appropriately titled “Defiant Jazz,” Helly (Britt Lower) and the Macrodata Refinment crew are treated to what supervisor Seth Milchick (Tramell Tillman) calls “The Music Dance Experience” as a reward for reaching a completion benchmark on work we still know nothing about. What followed is one of the most indelible sequences in the show’s short history: the normally stoic Milchick dancing under Technicolor lighting like he was transported back to the ‘70s with quaaludes steering his limbs. The unabashed joy and unhinged dancing were jarring in a place where handshakes only transpired after formal requests. It also shocked the people who made the show.“We had a choreographer who came, but basically, Tramell just kind of went off and said, ‘I’ve got some ideas. I’ve got some thoughts.’ Then, they just showed me this dance he came up with,” Stiller jokingly says.Lumon workspaces are typically monotonously mundane, barren of anything but four interconnected cubicles. Disrupting that with this foolishness seven episodes into the season added a somewhat terrifying levity that makes the bleakness of the characters’ everyday lives more apparent. That’s because every detail in the show seems meticulously arranged, down to the lights used in the scene, which Stiller revealed he hoped “wouldn’t break the reality” of the show. The surprise on the Innies’ faces when the lights started changing colors underscored the strangeness of scenario, and was pretty genuine. “We didn’t know the lights were going to change until we were shooting the scene,” Scott reveals. There are only two more episodes left for the podcast to break down. They’ll also be sharing tidbits about the new season of Severance as each episode airs. Let’s hope, at some point, we’ll get some answers about those damn goats.",
