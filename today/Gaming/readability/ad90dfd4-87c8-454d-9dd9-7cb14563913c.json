  "text": "Asher Elias called a State of the Goonion meeting yesterday, something that generally heralds a big announcement.  These meetings are usually short and often involve us going to war. State of the Goonion 2024 War was not the message this time around, in part because we have technically been at war for a while and taking systems in the southeast of null sec which PanFam and Winter Coalition decided not to defend.  That led to the destruction of a couple of their Keepstars and the Imperium capturing a swathe of space in the southeast.  Our foes declared that they would just take it all back when we got bored and went home to Delve. However, as the headline declared, some of us will not be going back to Delve but will head towards a new homeland as Asher announced that GSF would be packing up and moving east.  From the transcript (some “ums” removed): So, here’s the big announcement. It’s time for us to make a new story. Goons are departing from Delve. This plan has been in development for a long time, even before CCP announced the NullSec changes. We set out to capture space in the east, and we allocated several months of time because our enemies told their members that they were looking to fight. After they ran away, we were left holding the space. We won it too quickly. So I do want to apologize to you guys. We have been sort of spinning our wheels for a little bit. We did not expect to, you know, oops into four regions as quickly as we did, but we did. And so we’ve been left sort of spinning our wheels for a month or two now, um, and apologies for that, but, you know, things have to go on the schedule. They have to go on. We expected them to fight and they didn’t. After nine years in Delve, where we set up our homes after being evicted from Deklein and the north during the Casino War, the alliance is proposing to pack everything up and move once more. The reasoning given at the SOTG was that the new location… our primary staging system will be in UALX-3 in Tenerifis… will put us on the front line with PanFam, moving us closer to content and putting us between PanFam and smaller alliances in the Imperium. New GSF Staging location Also, the Equinox update, which will be mandatory by the end of the month, will make Delve too small to support the alliance, so we will be taking more space in the southeast. This was a bit of a shock as Goons have a long link to Delve as a region going back to the Great War.  Delve is Goons.  Anime is Cartoons. The Darius JOHNSON quote from years back… For the entire time I have been with the coalition we either lived in Delve or were invading Delve at least once a year. Delve – Summer 2012 Poster This is a big change.  An unprecedented change so far as I can tell. I have collected quite a bit of stuff over the last nine years after hauling everything I could manage out of the north in a suitcase carrier.  Now it is all going to have to move again. But not in a day.  Move ops will be ongoing for weeks if not months.  This will be a gargantuan effort.  You will be able to see its impact on the MER. People who have been away from the game may come back and need assistance years from now, so much stuff had been squirreled away.  Corporations and the alliance have their own mass of assets to corral and move, including structures.  Some of those are being transferred to the group that will take up residence in Delve after we leave, others are being unanchored for movement to our new home. I supposed the one good thing is that during World War Bee, when we were down to the last constellation and fighting PAPI every day, all the stuff I had spread around Delve either got pulled back to our Keepstar in 1DQ1-A or went to asset safety.  So at least my junk is consolidated into a single system. Now I just have to get it all in motion.  That won’t be easy.  I still have stockpiles of hulls, built up in anticipation of the last battle for the system, something that never came to pass as CCP’s starvation economy made ships too expensive for PAPI to commit in the numbers needed to take the system. So I have over 120 hulls on my main alone, and another couple dozen on alts.  Some I will be able to stack up in the hangars of the two capitals I have in 1DQ, including the carrier I bought back in 2013 and which has hauled my stuff around since then.  I jumped it out of Tribute just ahead of the hostiles and again into low sec as we lost systems left and right. My anniversary post back in 2019 was about the systems I had called home over the years in New Eden.  Soon there will be a new location on the list. A new location.  A new adventure.  A new skybox in space to act as a backdrop… though not that new.  UALX-3 had been home to a number of past clashes, including defending allied Keepstars not once but twice as well as failures to grab it from hostiles as recently as 2022. A screen shot from one of those fights After more than 20 years a lot of systems have long and complicated histories, but those that sit at well traveled cross roads in space are more likely than others to have acquired such reputations. The move itself isn’t so bad.  For a fast subcap it is just a dozen gates a Ansiblex jumps to get from 1DQ to UALX.  However, that includes a number of regional gates that are both long jumps that are choke points that capitals will need to gate through when the time comes. From Delve to the east It looks like GSF will be spreading out across four regions including parts of Tenerifis, Catch, Impass, and most of Immensea.  Again, all places I’ve been to… but not places where I have set down roots in the past.
