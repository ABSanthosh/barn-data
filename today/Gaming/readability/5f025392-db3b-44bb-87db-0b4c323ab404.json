Monster Hunter Wilds is the latest title in the Monster Hunter series. Enjoy a new game experience with thrilling hunting action! The beta test version includes three types of content: Character Creation, a Story Trial, and a Doshaguma Hunt. You'll start in Character Creation, then move onto the Story Trial quest, which includes cutscenes from the beginning of the story. Basic tutorials will guide you through a Chatacabra hunt as you experience seamless story and quest gameplay. Next, the Doshaguma Hunt quest involves slaying one of a pack of Doshaguma. Experience a new kind of hunting action in a dynamic environment that changes moment by moment. Your trusty Seikret mount lets you traverse the map and even switch between two weapons. You can use an SOS Flare during either quest to connect and play with others online in multiplayer. If there aren't enough players who can join, up to three NPC Support Hunters will join you instead. By participating in the beta test, you will be entitled to receive a reward in the full game. Don't miss out! Please review the end user license agreement before starting the game. https://www.monsterhunter.com/eula/wilds/ *You'll be able to carry over your character creation data from the Open Beta Test into the full game.
