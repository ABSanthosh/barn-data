Blizzard WoW Classic 2025 Roadmap We’re not getting anything in spring despite the placement of the MoP logo, but summer, summer seems to be on the agenda as Blizz has stated in some fine print that Mists of Pandaria Classic will ship by the end of August.  The fateful line: Mists of Pandaria Classic launches on or before August 31, 2025, and access is included with an active World of Warcraft Subscription or Game Time. That is earlier than I expected given the roadmap, which seemed to put it squarely in autumn, a season that does not begin until late September according to my calendar.  So that is a good thing in my book I guess.  It means we’ll get to the MoP pre-launch events and the expansion itself before summer has faded.  But we’re also getting well past the “classic” era of the game and, while I have some fond memories of the expansion, it was also something I played mostly solo and at least a year past its launch.  I did get that game breaking water strider mount though.  Will I put in the effort to do that again?  We shall see. Anyway, we have to get through spring… which has yet to arrive… and most of summer to get to that.  So why are we talking about this now? We are talking about that now because Blizz has bills to pay and owes Phil Spencer his cut… and Phil is the Paulie from Goodfellas in this scenario… so has to get out there with something new to sell every quarter to keep him happy or the layoffs will find their way to more of the Blizz team.  The line will be made to go up one way or another. And so, in a completely predictable moved that nobody could have failed to anticipate, Blizz has a pair of Upgrade Your Mists of Pandaria Classic Adventures packs up for sale six months early, retailing for $40 or $80, the extra forty bucks securing you a level 85 level boost and 30 days of game time. They seem to have learned their lesson about selling advantage somewhat.  Maybe.  I don’t know, because that auction house carrying $90 brontosaurus seemed to sell like gangbusters. This baby will hold so many auctions Maybe the lesson was that pets and mounts sell, because the MoP packs are very heavy on those AND include mounts for both classic and retail, so if you disdain classic but are a mount completionist in retail, then you’re going to have to pony up for this pack or be left out of the running! FOMO for the win! But at least they haven’t raised the subscription price in over 20 years.  Not in US dollar or Euro terms at least… sucks if you pay in Turkish lira of Aussie dollariedoos… but here it is still the same baseline $15 a month it has always been. Which I applaud them for, and also understand that they need to raise more money to appease the Paulies of the world who will insist that the line keeps going up. Which brings me around to Bobby Kotick, Blizzard’s previous Paulie, and believe me it pains me to mention him having hoped that, after his departure from Activision, after Microsoft made him even richer, that he would cease to be relevant ever again. But there he is in an interview over at PC Gamer chatting on about Blizz and Activision and Vivendi Games and there are some interesting tidbits about his time there. PC Gamer does caution that all of what he says is “from the perspective of a profit-first businessman” which is something we should always remember.  This is the greedy sex-pest who wanted to remove all fun from the video game creation process at one point. Anyway, he has a number of things to say, some of which might even be true, but in there he mentions the WoW subscription model. But the game’s broad appeal was obvious, and the business model had proven a masterstroke even if, inevitably, players did age out of it (I know I did). “You’d be shocked,” says Kotick. “150 million people churned out of World of Warcraft [over its history]. That’s a crazy number. Those are people paying $15 a month. It was the best subscription business of all time.” When it was suggested that the subscription could have been higher, he said that there were better ways to monetized the game rather than antagonizing the user base by raising the one price everybody was paying, and that is the policy that Blizz, and now Microsoft, has chosen. Bobby has been out giving other interviews of late.  He must be bored… or trying to get attention for his grand plan to buy TikTok… or refurbish his reputation.  He is certainly lying his ass off about some things. My favorite though was when he said that ex-EA CEO John Riccitiello was the worst video game CEO ever.  WCCFTech took some exception to that, but I have to admit he’s not completely off, though I might suggest Lars Wingefors of Embracer as a possible choice.  But Riccitello was pretty bad and squandered what EA had… and then went on to nearly fuck up Unity completely.  A track record of badness over an extended time. You never have to hand it to Bobby, but I can accept his conclusion on this point.",
