  "description": "In FBC: Firebreak, Corrupted Items can alter the way a Job unfolds in some chaotic ways, from reducing gravity to speeding up enemies or even forcing you into a game of \"red light, green light.\" Corrupted Items can make your life as a Firebreaker more painful than it needs to be. Luckily, you can (and usually should) destroy them with a tried-and-true method. Here's how to neutralize Firebreak Corrupted Items.Neutralize Corrupted Items in FBC: FirebreakIf you're playing a Job with Corrupted Items activated, you'll see a purple optional objective on the left side of the screen, under the main objective. This means somewhere--and it may be moving or stationary--you'll find a Corrupted Item. This item will create a gameplay modifier, most of which make your job harder to perform, so you'll want to prioritize removing that from the environment whenever you can.Find the Black Rock NeutralizerRegular guns and even your specialty items won't do the trick, however. Instead, you'll need a specific gun: the Black Rock Neutralizer. If there's a Corrupted Item on the map, one of these special guns will be found at an ammo station in the zone in which the item spawned. You'll want to seek out the ammo stations and find the one equipped with the Neutralizer.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

If there's a Corrupted Item on the map, one of these special guns will be found at an ammo station in the zone in which the item spawned. You'll want to seek out the ammo stations and find the one equipped with the Neutralizer.A Black Rock Neutralizer is a guaranteed drop if there's a Corrupted Item to destroy.You'll notice the Black Rock Neutralizer absolutely shreds. It can be appealing to use it for that reason, but note its limited ammo reserve, too. If you run out of ammo or misplace the Neutralizer, you'll have to find another or perhaps even just continue the mission without neutralizing the Corrupted Item.Additional NeutralizersNote that some Jobs, both with and without Corrupted Items activated, also have a chance to spawn the Neutralizer inside shelters, so you can and should check there for others too, as they make light work of the game's heartier foes. If you happen to exhaust all of the ammo in your first Neutralizer and don't think any more exist in your zone, move into a new zone and you may find another one if you're lucky. You can then travel back with it and eliminate multiple Corrupted Items with a single Black Rock Neutralizer.Unlock the Black Rock Rounds perkThere's one last way to neutralize Corrupted Items in FBC: Firebreak; for that, you'll need to be account level 19. At that point, you can unlock the perk called Black Rock Rounds found under the Bullet branch of the Research menu. With this perk, there's a chance your regular gun will fire Black Rock rounds, allowing you to neutralize Corrupted Items even without the speciality weapon.With Black Rock Rounds, you won't need to find a Neutralizer.Once you're level 19, you can unlock the weak version of the perk for five Lost Assets (the folders you pick up in missions). You can upgrade it to strong or resonant qualities, too, thereby increasing your chances of the rounds working as Black Round rounds.These are all the ways you can neutralize Corrupted Items, though I'd suggest keeping the exploding enemies modifier enabled if ever you're faced with that one. If you can keep your distance, it can act more like a boon than an obstacle, as it'll set off some lovely chain reactions of Hiss exploding each other.For more on Remedy's co-op game, you can read our FBC: Firebreak review.
