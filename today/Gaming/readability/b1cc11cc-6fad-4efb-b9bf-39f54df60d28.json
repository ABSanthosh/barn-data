I have finished Tony Tulathimutte's Rejection. It was, as I suspected, very good. Here's a bit I highlighted in which a character contemplates explaining Twitter to her terminally ill mother: \"Part of me genuinely wanted to try to explain how there existed two adversarial factions of female leftist cum-posters, one that posted about being bimbo throat-goats who wanted their big naturals blasted with cum but also wanted insulin to be state-subsidized, vs. the theorypilled cynics whose political acumen and hotness and crassness were part of a larger project of licensing ridicule, and how one of the latter did a mean quote-tweet of one of the former, which in each of their camps set off a chain of subtweets and retaliations and excavations of past racist tweets and micropartisan wagon-circling that accomplished nothing but to till the soil for future clashes and demonstrate how far beyond salvation everyone was, including, especially, obviously, me.\" Depending on your feeling on 'vs.' there's a case to be made for that being a single sentence. Good sentence, I thought. I've moved on to Eliza Clark's She's Always Hungry, although haven't read quite read enough yet to have formed any coherent thoughts on it. And you? Book for now!",
