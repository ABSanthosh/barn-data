The 5,000mAh Qi-certified model drops to $19.79 (normally $36) after you apply code \"U6KGSV4Z\" in cart. The 10,000mAh Qi2-ceritifed model drops to $29.99 (normally $50) after you apply $10 off code \"LDOEZMV7\" in cart. These power banks are designed to snap onto your magnetic phone back thanks to strong 11N magnets. Baseus makes solid power banks and I recommend them as a less expensive alternative to Anker.Baseus Picogo 5,000mAh Wireless Power Bank for $19.79Baseus Picogo 5,000mAh Qi-Certified Wireless Power Bank with 20W USB-C PortThis Baseus Picogo 5,000mAh power bank is super small and light, which is extra important for a battery that you're going to stick to the back of your phone. It measures just 0.3\" thin and weighs only 3.8 ounces. It's Qi-certified, so expect about 7.5W of inductive charging. That's not fast, but you can leave it attached to your phone and it will effectively trickle charge throughout the day. When you need faster charging, you can use the USB Type-C port for up to 20W of Power Delivery.Baseus Picogo 10,000mAh Qi2/MagSafe Power Bank for $29.99Baseus Picogo 10,000mAh Qi2-Certified Wireless Power Bank with 27W USB-C PortThe Baseus Picogo 10,000mAh power bank is bigger, but still lighter than most other MagSafe batteries out there. It measures 0.5\" thin and weighs 5 ounces. This model is Qi2/MagSafe certified, which means it can deliver up to 15W of inductive charging or double the rate of the original Qi charging stanndard. The USB Type-C port can supply up to 27W of Power Delivery if you're in a rush, and that's approaching the max charging rate of the iPhone 16 (30W in ideal conditions).How many times can you charge your phone?Macworld lists these power consumption specs (in Whr) for the iPhone 16:iPhone 16: 3,561mAh 13.7WhriPhone 16 Plus: 4,674mAh 18WhriPhone 16 Pro: 3,582mAh 13.8WhriPhone 16 Pro Max: 4,685mAh 18WhrA 10,000mAh power bank carries a 37Whr capacity. An 80% power efficiency rating (which is about standard for power banks) gives you about 29Whr of available charge. That means this power bank will charge an iPhone 16 Plus or Pro Max (with larger screen) up to 1.6 times or an iPhone 16 or Pro (with smaller screen) over two times. For a 5,000mAh power bank, just halve the numbers to get the approximate runtimes.The Samsung Galaxy S25 smartphones have slightly larger battery sizes (4,000mAh for the S25 and 5,000mAh for the S25 Plus and Ultra), so expect these power banks to charge them a bit less than an equivalently sized iPhone.See more power banks we've recommended:Looking for more iPhone resources?
