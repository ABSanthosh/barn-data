  "text": "Welcome Googoo tasks you with picking out the right words and the best stickers to ensure people come to a party you’re planning. A character named Googoo is moving to town and you’d like to invite everyone out to a party to welcome them here. To do that, you’ll need to entice them to come out using a well-written and sharply-decorated party invite. While a single nice invitation sent to everyone COULD do the job, you’ll have much better luck if you cater every invitation to the unique tastes and personalities of the people you want to come. It’s more work, but if you really want everyone to show up, it’ll be worth it. You have a handful of tools to help you pull this party off. For starters, you have a list of the various invitees and their personalities. Bo loves the outdoors and has a little bird friend with them at all times. Chuck is an old softie who is very conscious of their style (but is also hell-bent on getting revenge for…something). Zorgzuga is weird and kind of confuses everyone. You have a wide spread of people to convince to come. So, looking at their personalities, you’ll have to choose from an array of available words like “balloons”, “revenge”, “fun”, and more based on whether you think the invitee will like them. Then, you need to do the same with some stickers, choosing from moles, bananas in shoes, and other oddball things to really grab their attention. If all goes well, you’ll have a real wild get-together on your hands. Welcome Googoo is light and playful, but still comes with enough sticker and word options that you’ll labor just a little bit over what will get your guests to show up. It’s all worth it in the end to make ol’ Googoo feel welcome on their first day in town. Welcome Googoo is available now (for whatever you wish to pay for it) on itch.io.
