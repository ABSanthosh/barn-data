  "text": "Coming to PC and consoles. Image credit: Eurogamer Giant Skull, the studio founded by Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and God of War 3 game director Stig Asmussen last year, has signed a deal to create a new single-player action-adventure set in the world of Dungeons \u0026 Dragons. Asmussen announced his departure from Star Wars Jedi developer Respawn Entertainment back in 2023, when it was said he was waving goodbye in order to \"pursue other adventures\". Seven months later and Giant Skull was unveiled to the public with the goal of \"building gameplay-driven, story immersed action-adventure games set in captivating worlds\". And the first of those worlds, it now transpires, will be a familiar one to RPG fans; Wizards of the Coast has announced it's signed a deal with Giant Skull to create an \"all-new, single-player action-adventure title set in the world of Dungeons \u0026 Dragons\". Details are limited at this seemingly early juncture, but we do know it's in development for PC and console using Unreal Engine 5, with more information promised \"at a later date\". \"Our talented and experienced team at Giant Skull is built on creativity and curiosity,\" Asmussen wrote in a statement accompanying today's announcement. \"Our goal is to craft a rich new Dungeons \u0026 Dragons universe filled with immersive storytelling, heroic combat and exhilarating traversal that players will fully embrace.\" Giant Skull's new game is just one of a number of Dungeons \u0026 Dragons titles confirmed to be in development over the last few years. Payday developer Starbreeze, for instance, is working on a co-op live-service game currently expected to release in 2026, while Disney Dreamlight Valley studio Game Loft is developing a co-op adventure built around \"real-time survival and action\". And then there's a triple-A Unreal Engine 5 project from Dungeons \u0026 Dragons: Dark Alliance developer Invoke Studios, first announced back in 2022. It's a busy time in the world of Dungeons \u0026 Dragons games, then, and amid all this, Wizards of the Coast's search for a new studio to take on the Baldur's Gate series following developer Larian's departure seemingly continues.",
