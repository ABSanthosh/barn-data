TouchArcade Rating:Unrated Compatibility:HD Universal https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-little-to-the-left/id1613352146 I mean it looks like something I’d give a go of but 9.99 fill unlock seems expensive for the kind of game it is. It’s what’s put me off buying that Unpacking game being 9.99 and people saying it takes like 2 hours to finish. This sounds like it might have more content though? My daughter is obsessed with this game on PC; just looks like tidying up to me. Hopefully she doesn’t notice that it’s come to iOS! My comment does rather smack of “grumpy old man”; didn’t really mean it quite like that! I appreciate that it’s a well thought of game and I’m sure there’s good reason for that. sebgo and squarezero like this. I can recommend the game \"Satisgame\". It now has 22 chapters each 20 levels which makes a total of 440 levels. To unlock a chapter you have to look at 4 advertisements to unlock them permanently. otherwise the game is ad-free. Great game https://apps.apple.com/de/app/satisgame/id1669869019 Share This Page",
