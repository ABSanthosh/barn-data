See what the event was all about, including previously revealed content arriving at launch on July 11. Tony Hawk’s™ Pro Skater™ 3 + 4 is quickly nearing its July 11 release date, and to celebrate the upcoming launch, skaters, musicians, developers, and press were invited to the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles for THPS Fest, an evening of gaming, deep dives with skaters in the game, and performances by four of the artists featured on the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 in-game soundtrack. In partnership with concert promoter Goldenvoice, THPS Fest was hosted by sports commentator Selema Masekela, skateboard host and former Activision capture artist Steezus, and in-game skater Nora Vasconcellos. It also saw appearances from both returning and new skate talents like Chloe Covell, Steve Caballero, Jamie Foy, Kareem Campbell, Geoff Rowley, Margielyn Didal, Nora Vasconcellos, Tony Hawk, and more. Read on for a breakdown of the event and game content, including a look at the featured skateparks, innovations and enhancements, the reveal of two skaters, and more being brought into the game by the developers at Iron Galaxy Studios. Iron Galaxy Studios has a long history of working on some of the top IPs in video games. Their meticulous attention to detail and quality creates unforgettable gameplay experienced by players around the world. And now they’re extremely excited to put their stamp on Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4. Soundtrack to Skating THPS Fest attendees were treated to unforgettable live performances from four featured artists from the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 in-game soundtrack which included Urethane, Adolescents, Danny Brown, and Lupe Fiasco.  The final of the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 soundtrack was recently revealed with complete details of nearly every artist and track. Secret Skaters The Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater games are infamous for their wild cast of secret skaters, and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 is no different. Meet two of the highly anticipated secret skaters, who were announced during THPS Fest. Andy Anderson: Canadian skateboarder and helmet safety advocate known for his creative approach to blending street, vert, and freestyle skating into one delightful package. Bam Margera: American former pro skateboarder, stunt performer, television personality, filmmaker, and a featured skater from the original Tony Hawk’s™ Pro Skater™ 3. El Rey Event: The Parks Attendees got their hands on nine skateparks from the game, featuring five from the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 Skate Tour and four from the Tony Hawk’s™ Pro Skater™ 4 Skate Tour, including the new Waterpark level. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 Skate Tour Parks Los Angeles: Hit up sick tricks in the urban landscape of L.A. underneath the Hollywood sign.

Foundry: The first skatepark players will drop into as part of the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3Skate Tour, Foundry is set in an industrial steel mill with molten metal, ramps, grind rails, a secret area, and explosive environmental hazards. Canada: Shred in Calgary, Alberta at a snowy outdoor skatepark with ramps, rails, and cabins in an area blending urban and natural elements for diverse trick opportunities. Rio: A vibrant competition level set in Brazil featuring a colorful stadium in downtown Rio with high-scoring lines designed for intense contest runs.

Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4 Skate Tour Parks College: Skip class and shred the sprawling CCHU campus, stopping in to pop off tricks over the rooftops and across the student plaza while building up huge combos over the stadium rails. Go Chicken Hawks! San Francisco: Skate outside the Boardwalk View Hotel with views of the San Francisco Bay.
