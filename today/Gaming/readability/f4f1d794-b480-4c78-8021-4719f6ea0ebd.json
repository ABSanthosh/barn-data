  "text": "What is it you're meant to be thinking with again? Image credit: 1047 Games As much as I'm up for trying a new one whenever one arrives, I'm not particularly good at shooters. It just gets too sweaty for me, I prefer a good single-player shooter above all else because I can actually take down my opponents without the fear of embarrassing myself somehow. And yet here we are again, with the open beta for Splitgate 2, which started earlier today, leaving me thinking \"well, I could give it a go I suppose.\" Now, I haven't actually had a go yet because, well, I'm a bit busy letting you all know that you can go and play it, and what it contains. Gotta earn a living somehow. Anyway, there's a lot! The biggest thing is The Lab, which is essentially its new map creator that was teased in the initial open beta trailer. This pretty much does what it says on the tin, i.e. you can build your own maps and game modes. Pretty great fit for a game that combines Halo and Portal! Open Beta Gameplay Trailer | Splitgate 2 Watch on YouTube Then there's the return of Takedown, a team-based mode where if you kill an opponent your team's respawns are shorter, but if you get killed your respawns take longer. If you manage to down every enemy at the same time, you win! Stadium 2.0, a rework of the map from the original game, arrives with the beta too. There's also new 24-player onslaught maps, for those that like a bit more chaos. Hunt the Devs will also be returning from the open alpha, which isn't a mode so much as an achievement to set out. If you find a 1047 dev wearing a special flaming disco ball skin, you'll get a Dev Killer skin for the faction they're playing in return. On top of all of that, 1047 Games say that \"one more massive surprise\" is yet to be shown off, planned to be revealed whenever the game enters 1.0. There's no date set for that just yet, but player progression will continue on to the full game, so don't feel like you have to wait around for it. To sign-up to the beta, all you need to do is head to the game's official website, and pick your platform of choice. Easy peasy!",
