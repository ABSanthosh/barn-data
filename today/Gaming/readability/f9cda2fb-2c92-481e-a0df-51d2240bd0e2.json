  "text": "Image: Amazon PrimeReacher is a crime show about a big guy solving big mysteries, usually with his big muscles. It’s won hearts and minds thanks to remaining laser-focused on this simple but laudable premise, and season 3 appears to be doubling down on it in its new trailer as gentle giant Jack Reacher faces off against a dude who’s even bigger.Suggested ReadingLive Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'Suggested ReadingReacher season 3 arrives on Amazon Prime Video beginning with three episodes on February 20 that see the retired U.S. Army major going undercover to investigate a rug import business that’s seemingly up to no good, smuggling guns, drugs, or some other illicit product. It’s on this latest assignment that Reacher faces his toughest challenge yet: a 7-foot-tall bodyguard named Paulie. “He’s twice my size,” Reacher tells his handler. Yes...ha ha ha...YES.Fans are already ecstatic. “Somebody is bigger than Reacher. This alone is a solid reason to watch Season 3,” reads the top comment on the season 3 trailer’s YouTube page. “Finally, a worthy opponent for Reacher! This deserves unlimited seasons, keep em coming!” reads another. “This show should go on for 30 seasons,” added a third. Reacher’s success is part of a recent wave of “lean back” TV, also known as “smart-dumb” TV, that indulges in the fun and satisfying delights of storytelling that knows what it’s about, does it very well, and doesn’t try to take itself too seriously. Where The Lincoln Lawyer revels in absurd but totally awesome courtroom antics, Reacher in unabashedly a show about a decent, stand-up guy who never found a bad situation that couldn’t be made right again through the careful deployment of his rippling biceps and manhole-cover quads.In season 2 he threw a grill at a guy. I can’t wait to see what he picks up in season 3. .",
