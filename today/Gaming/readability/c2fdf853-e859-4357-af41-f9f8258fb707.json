  "text": "The RTX 4070 Ti Super GPU retails for $800 all by itself.Amazon's own Prime Day Sale was been pretty lackluster in terms of gaming PC deals, but fortunately there's an incredible deal going on right now at Dell. The Alienware Aurora R16 RTX 4070 Ti Super gaming PC has dropped $600 to $1,399.99. This is the lowest price we've seen for an RTX 4070 Ti gaming PC from any brand and probably the best gaming PC deal we saw for Prime Day. This gaming rig is more than powerful enough to handle gaming in 1440p or 4K at a solid 60fps even with the newest, most demanding titles like Black Myth: Wukong or Warhammer Space Marine 2.$600 Off Alienware Aurora R16 RTX 4070 Ti Super Gaming PCAlienware Aurora R16 Liquid Cooled Intel Core i7-14700F RTX 4070 Ti Super Gaming PC with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSDThis Alienware Aurora R16 gaming PC features an Intel Core i7-14700F CPU, RTX 4070 Ti Super GPU, 16GB of DDR5-1600MHz RAM, and a 1TB M.2 SSD. The Intel Core i7-14700F Raptor Lake Refresh CPU boasts a max clock of 5.4GHz with 20 cores, 28 threads, and a 33MB cache. If you plan to use this PC as a gaming rig, then an i7 is a better choice than an i9. Performance is nearly identical because games cannot utilize the extra cores that the i9 has and at higher resolutions, games are almost always GPU-bound. The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super is about 10% more powerful than the RTX 4070 Ti. This is a great card for gaming at any resolution, from 1080p all the way to 4K. At 1080p and 1440p you'll be able to achieve 144fps or beyond in most games, so it's a great complement to FHD or QHD monitors capable of achieving high refresh rates. 4K is a much more demanding resolution, but you should still be able to run most games at a consistent 60fps. The RTX 4070 Ti Super also has more VRAM than the RTX 4070 Ti (16GB vs 12GB), which means it's a great economical option for AI work.A note on Alienware's newest \"R16\" desktop chassisThe R16 is Alienware's current 2024 desktop PC design. It's 40% smaller in volume compared to previous iterations. It features a simple yet proven airflow pattern; air is drawn in through the side intake vents over the GPU area and a 120mm fan at the front of the case, and exhausts by way of a 120mm rear fan and two 120mm top fans. A 240mm radiator for the all-in-one liquid cooling system is mounted to these top fans. Some configurations don't actually include the liquid cooling system, but we rarely include them in this roundup. That's because Alienware's liquid cooling solution is far superior to their stock air cooling and is easily worth the price premium.Should You Wait for Black Friday?In most cases, we would say that Black Friday has the best deals of the year. Dell, however, is quite the opposite. Historically, Black Friday hasn't always been the best time to buy an Alienware computer. The best time of year to score Dell deals are usually Memorial Day and during September and October, right after the back-to-school rush but about a month before actual Black Friday. Either way, the deals that are going on right now are quite good. Some of them are the best prices of the year (especially this particular deal) and some are not.For more deals on Alienware computers, check out Dell's Early Black Friday Sale.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
