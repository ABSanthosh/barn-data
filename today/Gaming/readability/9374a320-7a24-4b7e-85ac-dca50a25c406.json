  "text": "Let's make this simple: You want to know if there are any post- or mid-credits scenes in Smile 2. The answer is no. Like the original, we cut to the credits on a big moment and writer/director Parker Finn lets that moment speak (and smile) for itself. Writer-director Parker Finn's horror sequel Smile 2 sees the return of the shape-shifting demon from the 2022 film, back to haunt a whole new cast of characters. In our Smile 2 review, our critic gave the film a 7 out of 10. He called the film \"a solid sequel that sicks the suicide-hex phantom on a pop star played – in a highly volatile, committed performance — by Aladdin’s Naomi Scott. Smile 2 doesn’t quite match its sadistically effective predecessor in the scare department, because once you’ve seen one phantom doppelganger grinning like the Cheshire Cat, you’ve seen them all. But the movie works as a nasty portrait of the downside of music-biz fame, and it builds to an ending deserving of every crooked smile it earns.\"Starting on Friday, we'll have a full spoiler breakdown of the film's ending and more. So be sure to check back then!Smile 2 GalleryDoes Smile 2 Have a Post-Credits Scene?As noted, there are no post-credits or mid-credits scenes in the film. Though the closing credits do find Cristobal Tapia de Veer’s terrific score going into a surreal, experimental place, overlaying music with sounds of screaming and agony, invoking the feeling that the movie’s events are bleeding into the music.Are you excited for Smile 2?
