It’s impossible to keep up with everything hitting the digital space, whether it be Premium Video on Demand (PVOD) or a traditional streaming network. With that in mind, we figured it was well past time for us to whip up a little something to help you keep up (and catch up) with all there is to watch in the big, wide world of digital viewing. And thus, the Streaming Rewind was born! We’ll update this list at the end of each week so you can check out what you may have missed, and what’s coming up on the weekend. We’ll keep it a mix of popular releases and noteworthy lesser-known titles to help you find what’s worth taking the risk on as well as dive into a few things that we loved and why we loved ‘em, or just break down a show or movie that left us with some opinions. Sometimes, we’ll even have guest entries from other members of the IGN staff. If you’re not interested in all that and just want to see a bulleted list of what’s out there, pop on down to the New and Noteworthy and ICYMI sections.Mythic Quest Season 4 Is HereMythic Quest is finally back with Season 4! Though “finally” might be a little bit unfair given how long it takes other shows nowadays. Still, everyone’s favorite game developers have returned, and everyone’s back under the same roof again. Ian (Rob McElhenney) and Poppy (Charlotte Nicdao) are back in full swing at Mythic Quest HQ after their failed game from last season became Mythic Quest’s most recent expansion. The first couple of episodes bring a hilarious mix of fiscal responsibility and AI mockery but, most importantly, this cast continues to fire on all cylinders. Spider-Man Returns With a New Disney+ SeriesYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man has hit Disney+, joining X-Men ‘97 and What If…? in the Marvel animation pantheon. The series makes some considerable changes to Spider-Man’s origins while still sticking to the core of the character, and gives a fun look at Peter Parker’s youth as he takes on a brand new school. Friends new and old come into play, challenging Pete as he juggles school, an internship and, of course, being your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. At its core, the series has a strong understanding of the empathy that keeps the hero going while still giving us a fresh look at the challenges he’s about to face. Sing Sing Hits DigitalI was certain Sing Sing must have already been available on digital and demand given that it came out mid-2024, but everything points to it hitting this week. So, whether or not that’s because it recently saw a return to theaters because of its Academy Award nomination, I’m going to use this moment to highlight what ended up being my favorite movie of 2024. Colman Domingo has never delivered a disappointing performance in his life, but he’s on another level here. There are aspects of the film that I found best discovered organically, so if you’re able to go in blind I highly recommend it. Learning what I know now about the film after I had watched only added to my emotional response to the story of prisoners turning to the arts as an act of both distraction and reformation.New and Noteworthy This Week: Moana 2, January 28 — Digital and demand Den of Thieves 2, January 28 — Digital and demandYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, January 29 — Disney+Mythic Quest, January 29 — Apple TV+Sing Sing, January 31 — Digital and DemandThe 67th Annual Grammy Awards, February 2 — CBS and Paramount+ICYMI: If you had too much going on last week, here are all of the things that premiered or debuted on streaming and digital that you may have missed.The Damned, January 21 — Digital and demandSonic the Hedgehog 3, January 21 — Digital and demandSuits L.A., January 23 — NBCStar Trek: Section 31, January 24 — Paramount+Grafted, January 24 — ShudderParadise, January 16 — HuluIn This Article",
