He's, understandably, a bit tired after that and retreats to his home in the Deep Woods to recover--but not before giving you a new spell, Dragon's Breath.That spell is key to removing the vines that previously blocked you from entering the Deep Woods, and you can use it to unblock the caves where the crafting recipes for Fields of Mistria's sprinkler and auto-petter are. Before venturing inside, you'll want to have an axe of at least copper grade or higher to deal with the stumps in the woods. You also need to deal with the giant rock blocking your way next to the carpenter's shop, if you haven't already, and that requires at least a copper pickaxe.Caldarus' home is in the region's upper right corner. Make your way there, and chat with him to add him to your journal as a romance interest.Caldarus' heart levelShortly after the update, players reported that their relationship with Caldarus started out at its maximum level of six hearts. Not long after, NPC Studio said they pushed an adjustment that meant Caldarus' affection meter would start at a level that is in keeping with your story's progress. In other words, if you're caught up on Fields of Mistria's main story quests, he'll still have six hearts, but it'll be fewer for those who have a ways to go.If you're new to the game and want to start things off with Caldarus as if he were any other romance interest, you might want to hold off on advancing too far in the story and just do the missions required to reach the Fire Seal quest.Caldarus' loved and liked giftsStatue Caldarus will still function as normal on your farm, even after Human Caldarus sets up house.We haven't yet uncovered all of Caldarus' preferred gifts, but we do have a few you can aim for to help woo him more effectively.Caldarus' loved giftsCaldarus StatuetteVeggie Sub SandwichApple Honey CurrySpring GaletteCaldarus' liked giftsFish TacosIce Cream SundayVegetable QuicheGolden CookiesChocolate CakeThe only thing we've discovered that Caldarus hates is Dragon's Claw, which, seeing as it's the equivalent of giving your lover a severed finger as a present, is hardly surprising. By that same logic, he probably dislikes Dragon's Scale as well. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com",
