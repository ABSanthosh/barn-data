  "text": "But is it worth getting extra RAM and storage? Image credit: RPS Photo Composite / Dell Alienware Area-51 gaming desktop is the kind of PC that makes console players jellous. It's big, powerful, and costs as much as a used car. But if you're dropping this kind of cash, you want to make sure you're getting the best deal. The $3,749.99 model already looks like it could run Cyberpunk 2077 while making you breakfast, but Alienware has an upgraded $4,349.99 version that throws in a better processor, double the RAM and twice the storage. The real question is do you actually need it, or is Dell just tempting you with shiny numbers? Let's find out. Spec Area-51 $3,749.99 Area-51 $4,349.99 What you need to know Processor Intel Core Ultra 7 265 (20-core, 1.8GHz to 5.3GHz, 66MB cache) Intel Core Ultra 9 285 (20-core, 1.9GHz to 5.6GHz, 76MB cache) The Ultra 7 is already more than fast enough for gaming. The Ultra 9 gives slightly higher clock speeds and a bigger cache, but you won’t notice the difference unless you’re running heavy creative workloads. Graphics Card NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 16GB GDDR7 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 16GB GDDR7 Identical GPU in both models. Paying extra won’t make your games look or run any better. Memory (RAM) 32GB DDR5 (2x16GB) 6400MT/s 64GB DDR5 (2x32GB) 6400MT/s 32GB is already overkill for gaming. 64GB is only worth it if you’re editing 4K/8K videos, rendering 3D models, or running heavy multitasking workflows. Storage 1TB NVMe M.2 PCIe Gen4 SSD 2TB NVMe M.2 PCIe Gen4 SSD 1TB is fine if you manage your game library, but newer games are getting massive. If you hate deleting games, 2TB is nice—but you can add a bigger SSD later for way less money. Cooling 240mm Liquid-Cooled CPU, Positive Pressure Airflow 240mm Liquid-Cooled CPU, Positive Pressure Airflow Same cooling system in both models. They’ll run at the same temps and noise levels, so you’re not getting any advantage here. Power Supply 850W Gold Rated ATX12VO PSU 850W Gold Rated ATX12VO PSU No difference. Both provide plenty of power for the system, with room for future GPU upgrades. Motherboard ATX Standard with Custom Heatsinks ATX Standard with Custom Heatsinks Alienware uses a custom ATX board with standard slots, meaning both models allow easy upgrades later. Ports (Front \u0026 Rear) Same on both models: 2x USB 3.2 Gen 1, 2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, 1x Mic-in, 1x Line-out, 2x Thunderbolt 4, 2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, 3x USB 2.0, 2.5G RJ-45 Ethernet, Optical Audio Same as base model No extra ports in the more expensive model. You get the same connectivity options regardless of which one you buy. Weight \u0026 Size 22.4\" (H) x 9.12\" (W) x 24.04\" (D), 76.1 lbs 22.4\" (H) x 9.12\" (W) x 24.04\" (D), 76.1 lbs Both models are identical in size and weight. No difference in design, cooling, or build quality. Processor The base model comes with Intel's Ultra 7 265, while the pricier version bumps up to an Ultra 9 285. Both are 20-core processors that would laugh at your average workload, but Ultra 9 is slightly faster and has a bigger cache. Sounds impressive, but in real-world gaming? You'll never notice the difference. The Ultra 7 265 already crushes anything you throw at it, meaning the extra speed on the Ultra 9 is like paying more for a sports car that goes 220 mph instead of 210 mph. It all looks cool on paper, but pointless unless you're racing. If you're into content creation, video editing, or something ridiculously CPU-heavy like running multiple virtual machines, then the Ultra 9 upgrade might be worth considering. But for pure gaming? The Ultra 7 already does the job, and your frame rates won't magically jump just because you spent extra. Graphics Card No matter which build you pick, you're getting the same NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 with 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM, so there's zero reason to pay more expecting better graphics performance. This card is an absolute monster that destroys 4K gaming, and with ray tracing and DLSS 4 doing their thing, your games will look stunning while still running high frame rates. Unless you plan on running triple-monitor 8K setups for some reason, this GPU already maxes out what's possible in modern gaming. Paying extra won't make Cyberpunk 2077 look any better or help you get headshots faster in Warzone. If you only care about gaming, the cheaper build gets you the same graphics performance for $600 less. Memory The base model comes with 32GB of DDR5 RAM, while the expensive one doubles that to 64GB. Now, 64GB might sound impressive, but it's completely unnecessary unless you're editing 4K videos while playing Baldur's Gate 3 and keeping 100 Chrome tabs open. Most modern games barely touch 16GB, and even the most demanding ones don't go beyond 24GB. That means 32GB is already way ahead of what you actually need. If you run multiple heavy programs at once, edit videos, or do some insane 3D rendering, then 64GB could be helpful. But if all you're doing is gaming, streaming, and some light editing on the side, you're better off sticking with 32GB and keeping that extra cash for something useful like a bigger monitor or better peripherals. Storage The base model comes with 1TB of NVMe SSD storage, while the upgraded version doubles that to 2TB. Considering that Call of Duty alone takes up a ridiculous 200GB, this is the only upgrade that actually makes sense. If you install a lot of massive AAA games, 1TB will fill up fast, and nobody wants to deal with constantly deleting stuff to install the next big release. That said, storage is the easiest and cheapest thing to upgrade later. Instead of paying Alienware's premium, you could buy a 2TB or 4TB NVMe SSD separately and install it for way less money. If you despise uninstalling games and want everything installed at once, the 2TB version is more convenient, but from a value perspective, it's cheaper to add more storage later instead of buying it pre-installed. Cooling \u0026 Power Both models use the exact same cooling system and 850W power supply, so spending extra won't make your system run cooler, quieter, or more efficiently. Alienware's new positive pressure airflow design is already one of the best cooling setups they've had, keeping the CPU and GPU running cool. If Alienware had included a beefier PSU or a bigger cooling solution in the \"high-end\" model, it might have been worth considering. But since it's exactly the same, paying more does not guarantee extra performance or longevity. Gamers Should Save Their Money If you're buying this purely for gaming, the $3,749.99 model is the obvious choice. You get the same RTX 5080 GPU, an already overpowered CPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM (6400 Mhz), 240mm liquid-cooled CPU and 850W PSU. The only real advantage of the pricier model is extra storage and RAM, which you can upgrade for way less than the $600 bump. If you're a content creator, 3D artist, or someone who runs heavy multitasking workloads, the extra RAM and CPU speed in the $4,349.99 model might make sense. But for gamers, it's a waste of money. You're better off grabbing the cheaper build and using the extra cash for a 4K monitor, a high-end mechanical keyboard, or some extra storage down the road. Both machines are insanely powerful, but if you want the best value, the cheaper Area-51 build wins every time.",

Now, 64GB might sound impressive, but it\u0026#39;s completely unnecessary unless you\u0026#39;re editing 4K videos while playing \u003ca data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii\"\u003eBaldur\u0026#39;s Gate 3\u003c/a\u003e and keeping 100 Chrome tabs open. Most modern games barely touch 16GB, and even the most demanding ones don\u0026#39;t go beyond 24GB. That means 32GB is already way ahead of what you actually need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you run multiple heavy programs at once, edit videos, or do some insane 3D rendering, then 64GB could be helpful. But if all you\u0026#39;re doing is gaming, streaming, and some light editing on the side, you\u0026#39;re better off sticking with 32GB and keeping that extra cash for something useful like a bigger monitor or better peripherals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eStorage\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe base model comes with 1TB of NVMe SSD storage, while the upgraded version doubles that to 2TB. Considering that Call of Duty alone takes up a ridiculous 200GB, this is the only upgrade that actually makes sense. If you install a lot of massive AAA games, 1TB will fill up fast, and nobody wants to deal with constantly deleting stuff to install the next big release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, storage is the easiest and cheapest thing to upgrade later. Instead of paying Alienware\u0026#39;s premium, you could buy a 2TB or 4TB NVMe SSD separately and install it for way less money. If you despise uninstalling games and want everything installed at once, the 2TB version is more convenient, but from a value perspective, it\u0026#39;s cheaper to add more storage later instead of buying it pre-installed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCooling \u0026amp; Power\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth models use the exact same cooling system and 850W power supply, so spending extra won\u0026#39;t make your system run cooler, quieter, or more efficiently. Alienware\u0026#39;s new positive pressure airflow design is already one of the best cooling setups they\u0026#39;ve had, keeping the CPU and GPU running cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Alienware had included a beefier PSU or a bigger cooling solution in the \u0026#34;high-end\u0026#34; model, it might have been worth considering. But since it\u0026#39;s exactly the same, paying more does not guarantee extra performance or longevity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eGamers Should Save Their Money\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re buying this purely for gaming, the $3,749.99 model is the obvious choice. You get the same RTX 5080 GPU, an already overpowered CPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM (6400 Mhz), 240mm liquid-cooled CPU and 850W PSU. The only real advantage of the pricier model is extra storage and RAM, which you can upgrade for way less than the $600 bump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re a content creator, 3D artist, or someone who runs heavy multitasking workloads, the extra RAM and CPU speed in the $4,349.99 model might make sense. But for gamers, it\u0026#39;s a waste of money. You\u0026#39;re better off grabbing the cheaper build and using the extra cash for a 4K monitor, a high-end mechanical keyboard, or some extra storage down the road. Both machines are insanely powerful, but if you want the best value, the cheaper Area-51 build wins every time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
