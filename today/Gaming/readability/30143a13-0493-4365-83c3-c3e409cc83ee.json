  "text": "inCARceration finds you in a heap of trouble that you can only escape by taking on some really odd jobs while trapped in your car. While following the tutorial for an innocent driving game, you may have accidentally run over a few dozen people because you didn’t learn how to use the brakes fast enough. As such, the court of Dublin, Ireland, USA has sentenced you to be welded inside of your car (hence the title). Now, it’s possible for you to get your freedom back by carrying out an array of jobs flawlessly while you’re stuck in your vehicle. However, if the court doesn’t feel you’re trying hard enough, you’ll be executed. What follows is a Warioware-like experience as you go through your temporary jobs while trying to get your parole. How effectively do you feel you can conduct business inside of your car? Deliver burgers? Mow the lawn? You have a few seconds to get your bearings in each of the varied stages, but you’d better figure out your task and how you’re supposed to carry it out in your vehicle really fast because it’s very easy to fail them. Do I run people over to feed them? Is the guard facing me right now when I’m trying to take his gun? Am I gonna overshoot the giant egg I need to make dinner? So much is on the line. Thankfully (or perhaps not) your car turns on a dime. The court was lenient during my first week of inCARceration, but that leniency only extended so far. Luckily I have as many lives as I want to come back and play this delightfully ridiculous racing minigame collection, because I’m finally getting the hang of it AND it’s incredibly funny the whole time I’m working towards its many endings. inCARceration is available now on itch.io.
