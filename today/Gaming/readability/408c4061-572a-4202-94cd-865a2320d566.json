  "text": "Plus more storage for your Steam Deck and PC. Image credit: AMD / LG It's the day before Amazon Prime Day 2025, and we're already seeing some early deals. Ryzen 5 5500 is a killer budget CPU with 6 cores and 12 threads, which is more than enough for gaming and multitasking. Pair that with the LG 32” curved QHD monitor at 180Hz for under $200 and you're basically upgrading your setup at half price. Toss in a Samsung microSD for storage expansion for your Steamdeck or Rog Ally X, a beefy 4TB Crucial SSD for speed and space, or even the HP Victus laptop with a solid CPU-GPU combo. Here's all of today's epic deals: You’re getting a 6-core, 12-thread unlocked CPU with a cooler for $66. It’ll handle 1080p gaming like a champ and doesn’t break the bank. Perfect for budget builds that want real muscle without overspending. A 32-inch QHD curved screen with 180Hz refresh and 1ms response under $200 is rare. The 1000R curve pulls you into the action, and it’s big enough to double as a second screen for work. For less than $23, you're getting a 256GB card with up to 160 MB/s speed and solid compatibility with phones, cameras, and Switch. Includes an adapter too. Cheap, fast, reliable. 4TB Gen4 NVMe SSD with a heatsink for $235 is clean value. Fast speeds, efficient performance, and a huge amount of space for less than 6 cents per gigabyte. A Ryzen 7 CPU with RTX 4050 GPU for $649 is legit value. You get a 144Hz screen, 16GB RAM, and 512GB SSD in a well-balanced rig that’s ready for modern gaming and productivity. This one punches above its price with a 200Hz refresh and 0.5ms response. It’s under $130 and doesn’t look or feel like a budget monitor at all. OLED at 480Hz for under $735 is nuts. This display’s all about speed and deep contrast. Whether you’re into shooters or single-player stunners, this one handles it with grace and speed. Massive, curved OLED with Dual QHD and 240Hz refresh. This monitor is the kind of thing you build a setup around. At $900 off, it's no-brainer territory for ultra-immersive play. 4K QD-OLED at 240Hz with Dolby Vision for under $850 is bonkers. If you’re looking to futureproof your display and don’t want compromises, this is it.",
