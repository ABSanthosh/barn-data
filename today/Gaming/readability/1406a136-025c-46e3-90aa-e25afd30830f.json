Pre-orders went live today for the highly anticipated PC port of Red Dead Redemption, finally revealing the cost: $49.99.That's the price listed across Steam, the Epic Games Store, and Rockstar's own website on Thursday. That $50 will get you the complete single-player experiences of Red Dead Redemption and the Undead Nightmare expansion, as well as bonus content from the Game of the Year Edition (it does not, however, include multiplayer).Red Dead Redemption's PC port price has finally been confirmed. Rockstar finally announced earlier this week that the PC version will arrive on October 29, a full 14 years after Red Dead Redemption first launched on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 back in 2010. In addition to the aforementioned content, it'll also include the following features:Native 4K resolution and beyond at up to 144hz on supported hardwareMonitor support for both Ultrawide (21:9) and Super Ultrawide (32:9)Full keyboard and mouse supportUpscaling technologies support for Nvidia DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.0Nvidia DLSS Frame GenerationAdjustable draw distances, shadow quality settings, and moreThe long-requested PC version was developed by Double Eleven, which also worked on Red Dead Redemption's PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch ports. Before this week's official announcement, it was long-rumored and all but confirmed after the PlayStation Store bizarrely claimed in August that the game was \"now on PC,\" following evidence of a port being unearthed by datamines of Rockstar's website. We don't need to tell you that Rockstar's Wild West epic is a modern classic, but if you are looking for more while you wait for it to hit PC, check out IGN's 2010 Red Dead Redemption review. We handed it a 9.7/10, calling it \"one of the deepest, most fun, and most gorgeous games around.\"Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.
