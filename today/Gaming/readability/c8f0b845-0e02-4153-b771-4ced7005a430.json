  "description": "You tackle many quests in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. However, there are a select few that, once completed, also cause other missions to end abruptly. Likewise, there are those that prevent you from leaving hastily, lest these distractions lead you to abject failure. Here's our guide to help you with the points of no return in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. Likewise, please be reminded that this article contains major spoilers.What are the points of no return in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2A point of no return is considered a pivotal moment in a game, one where you have no choice but to proceed onward until you reach a conclusion. During really important moments, you're also warned regarding events that are about to transpire. It's recommended that you keep a manual save handy by consuming your Savior Schnapps, just in case you want to try other objectives first.Here are what we classify as points of no return:Major - When you reach a major point of no return in the campaign, you'll see a notification that warns you before you proceed any further. Doing so (a) causes some side quests to end prematurely, and (b) \"railroads\" you through several missions. What this means is that you have to continue onward to tackle multiple quests in succession.Minor - Some quests will either have a hidden timer or an area-wide restriction where you're not allowed to leave until you're done with the key objective. Minor point of no return: Wedding CrashersA minor point of no return in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is Wedding Crashers, which is also the first proper main quest in the campaign given all the requirements and side objectives that you can undertake. Once you join the wedding celebrations at Semine, you have to complete the whole thing.Not only that, but this also leads to For Whom the Bell Tolls, a mission that's filled with tension and excitement due to the things you need to do to save a fellah. You also won't be able to fast travel for a while as you're doing these tasks. Major point of no return: For VictoryThe major point of no return in the game's first act happens during a quest called For Victory. After dealing with a certain problem while accompanied by soldiers, you have to report back to Von Bergow. An objective then appears, telling you to talk to Hans Capon in the evening, followed by a warning notification.Before you talk to Hans, make sure you complete the Demons of Trosky side quest, since it automatically fails if you proceed with For Victory. If you do decide to continue, you have to handle three huge quests in succession, culminating in Storm. Also, don't forget to romance Klara while you're at it. Minor point of no return: The King's GambitThe King's Gambit is a minor point of no return during the campaign's second act. You receive this quest right after Taking French Leave.The goal in The King's Gambit is to disguise yourself as a waiter, so you can join a council meeting that takes place in a few days in-game. Because the council will convene with or without you, it's imperative that you proceed with the main objective as soon as possible. Failure to do so actually leads to a game over. Major point of no return: OratoresThere's also another major point of no return in Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and it takes place during the Oratores main quest. Here's a quick summary:Your goal is to return to Ruthard Castle via the underground tunnel system. This also gives you an opportunity to romance Rosa.After dealing with the foes in the castle, you have to acquire a key and check out the crypts.Eventually, you have to catch a fellah who tries to escape on horseback. Prior to this stage, you need to make sure that you have a horse mount with gear pieces/armors that grant higher speed. Otherwise, you won't be able to catch up with your quarry.A warning notification will then pop up once you return to Ruthard Castle.Continuing past this segment causes several side quests to fail automatically. These include The Thunderstone, The White Roebuck, and Bellatores. Note that, as of the time of this writing, we're unable to confirm if other missions like The Fifth Commandment and The Devil's Pack end abruptly, too, as we had already finished them earlier in our playthrough.In any case, upon completing Oratores, you actually end up advancing toward the campaign's later stages and conclusion. That's also when you get to romance Katherine and romance Hans Capon.That does it for our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 point of no return guide. We hope this article helps you make the right decisions as you progress further into this wonderful and compelling campaign.If you need more tips as you explore Bohemia in the Middle Ages, be sure to visit our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 guides hub.",
