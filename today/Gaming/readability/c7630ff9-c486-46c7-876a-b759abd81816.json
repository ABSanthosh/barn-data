  "text": "Guess they didn't want to build any more rockets Image credit: Build a Rocket Boy Last week, I questioned whether MindsEye was a real game or not. This week, that question lingers. Why, you ask? Well, as spotted by our good friends over at Eurogamer, two executives at the studio behind the game, Build a Rocket Boy, have now departed the company. Let me just check when MindsEye is coming out… oh, that's right, literally one week from today. Surely this is only good news! In a LinkedIn post from yesterday, now former chief legal officer Riley Graebner shared news of his departure after three and a half years at the company, saying he was \"proud\" of what the team has accomplished in that time. Former chief financial officer Paul Bland doesn't seem to have made an announcement of his exit per se, but the experience section of his own LinkedIn account lists his time at Build a Rocket Boy as ending in June (typically roles listed on LinkedIn will say \"present\" if a person is still at the company). Now, I don't know about you, but two executives leaving a studio, no matter their position, doesn't scream \"incoming success story.\" There could be any myriad of reasons as to why they've left of course, this is just speculation, the timing is just a bit odd so close to release for such high level positions. Thus far hardly any actual gameplay of MindsEye has been shown off, though publisher IO Interactive did announce a showcase for this Friday, June 6th, where more of it will be shown off. Will it be overshadowed by IO's own James Bond game that's also getting a proper look-in, now revealed to be called 007 First Light? Almost certainly, but at least there might be more than five minutes of gameplay this time around.",
