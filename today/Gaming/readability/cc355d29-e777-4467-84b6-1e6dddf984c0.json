The needles and accents on the handle glow when you hold it. The lighting effects can also be activated by turning on display mode, so you can show it off to friends without removing it from the display stand. You could even insist that it's not a toy while your friends ask if they can try it. You'll probably also want to display the box shown below, because it's also quite cool.The Needler requires six AA batteries to run. Your best bet here is to pair the blaster with some rechargeable batteries. You can get this Energizer AA and AAA battery charger with four batteries included for 50% off at Amazon during its Black Friday sale. You'll need two more batteries still, but a 16-pack of Amazon Basics AA batteries is only $14 right now. Or you can get even better value by opting for the 24-pack for $18.Nerf LMTD Halo Needler boxHalo fans should also check out Target's deal on the Mega Showcase Xbox 360 Collector Building Set.
