  "text": "Things are going on in New Eden this month so it seems like a good time to annoy future me with another Friday Bullet Points post, this time about EVE Online.  I’ll get straight into it. Alliance Tournament XX Starting Tomorrow! The feeders and other preliminaries are out of the way and all that is left is for the final 32 teams to take to the field and decide who has it all figured out this year. I’m just rolling this for all further ATXX posts… CCP has a Google sheet posted with the schedule for this weekend and next.  But the only known matches will be tomorrow, so I’ll post a screen grab of that. Alliance Tournament XX Day One The final winner will be decided on the afternoon of the 27th with the best of five match up for the whole enchilada.  Will the defending champions, Fraternity won ATXIX, be able to defend their crown? Also, I was looking for a text list of all the groups in the tournament and the best I could do was the flagship list.  But that is all of them. | Team Name | Flagship |---------------------------|----------------------- | Arrival. | Vargur | Brave Collective | Bhaalgorn | Bright Side of Death | Leshak | Deteriorated | Armageddon Navy Issue | Evasive Maneuvering. | Leshak | Exodus. | Armageddon Navy Issue | Fraternity. | Armageddon Navy Issue | Genshin Impact Alliance | Armageddon Navy Issue | Goonswarm Federation | Bhaalgorn | Hole Control | Barghest | IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII | Bhaalgorn | NO NEED LOOSE FACE | Armageddon Navy Issue | Odin's Call | Armageddon Navy Issue | Of Essence | Armageddon Navy Issue | OnlyFleets. | Barghest | Pandemic Horde | Vindicator | Paper Numbers | Armageddon Navy Issue | Platinum Sensitivity. | Bhaalgorn | Plug N Play | Armageddon Navy Issue | Post Pod Clarity | Armageddon Navy Issue | Ragequit Cancel Sub | Vindicator | Ronin Reloaded | Armageddon Navy Issue | Rote Kapelle | Armageddon Navy Issue | SL0W CHILDREN AT PLAY | Vindicator | Snuffed Out | Bhaalgorn | Templis CALSF | Bhaalgorn | The Tuskers Co | Bhaalgorn | Till Doomsday | Vindicator | Truth. Honour. Light. | Bhaalgorn | Unspoken Alliance. | Bhaalgorn | WE FORM V0LTA | Barghest | White Squall. | Bhaalgorn For those interested, there are 12 Armageddon Navy Issues, 10 Bhaalgorns, 4 Vindicators, 3 Barghests, 2 Leshaks, and a Vargur on that list… for whatever that is worth. I am a fairly casual AT fan… if I could even be considered a fan… but I will have CCP’s Twitch channel up as much as possible during the event, if only to earn drops and channel points that can be traded in for SKINs. Addendum: After I wrote this CCP finally put up a post about ATXX and got their own brackets site up.  So those are now available. CSM19 Elections Still Going! Voting started yesterday and effectively runs, for those of us in the US, until this coming Wednesday. Council of Stellar Management 19 I know, I did a whole post about this yesterday, but here are all the links again today. CCP – CSM 19 – Cast Your Vote Now! CCP – CSM Voting Page CCP – CSM19 Dev Blog CCP – CSM 19 Candidate Announcements CCP – CSM Candidate Campaign Forum CCP – The Roles and Duties of a member of the Council of Stellar Management Vote now so you can complain later with full authenticity about how the organization of the null sec blocs dominate while low sec and wormhole candidates suffered through their usual chaos. Further Updates on the Revenant Expansion We heard previously that the Revenant expansion is set to land on November 12th. The Revenant Expansion is Coming As part of the run up to that launch CCP has released a bit more information about what they have planned… though not much… but then, there isn’t a lot to the Revenant expansion so far, so there isn’t much to share. That dev blog has a video that goes through some of the features. I appreciate the effort, and there are some useful items in there around corporation projects, like being able to make them with multiple goals or being able to limit the maximum participation payout to members, but I do tend to be quite skeptical about its ability to run a Ship Replacement Program (SRP).  I did not see anything there that would match a fit against a template, and most large organization programs require you to fly an exact fit. I could also imagine some problems/abuse of this with it paying out the current market value of the hull, modules, and cargo.  You need to include cargo for refits and ammo, but what happens if I looted something expensive or just shoved something in there unrelated to the doctrine.  Should I really get recompense for my Fedo or exotic dancers? Anyway, SRP things are way above my pay grade.  My only experience is being on the supplicant end of such systems, and until it can reject a loss with a caustic comment about the rigs still being in the cargo it isn’t there yet. Equinox Totality Day is Coming Meanwhile, CCP is trying to wrap up the parts of the Equinox expansion they are simply pushing into Revenant, like all the null sec sovereignty changes.  Those will all be mandatory come October 29th. Equinox – in progress since June 11, 2024 We’ll see about the the rejuvenation aspect as time goes on, but there is a decent thread up on r/eve attempting to call out the winners and losers with this return to a state where a system’s true sec dictates its usefulness and location matters. Crimson Harvest Crawls On I am going to say right now that Crimson Harvest came out of the gate slow, dull, and a bit broken this year.  The only people enthusiastic about it as it launched seemed to be suicide gankers who love the 90% drop rate so much that they doubled their efforts to blap unsuspecting haulers in high sec.  I am going to have to look at Uedama kills in with the next MER. Crimson Harvest 2024 While I will have a whole post about the event at some point, it did get a little bit better as time went on… mostly because many people saw how slow progress was going to be and gave up.  But that is just more hacking sites for me… when I can find them… and they are the right kind.",

there isn’t a lot to the \u003cem\u003eRevenant\u003c/em\u003e expansion so far, so there isn’t much to share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat dev blog has a video that goes through some of the

with multiple goals or being able to limit the maximum participation payout to members, but I do tend to be quite skeptical about its ability to run a Ship Replacement Program (SRP).  I did not see anything there that would match a fit against a template, and most large organization programs require you to fly an exact fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could also imagine some problems/abuse of this with it paying out the current market value of the hull, modules, and cargo.  You need to include cargo for refits and ammo, but what happens if I looted something expensive or just shoved something in there unrelated to the doctrine.  Should I really get recompense for my Fedo or exotic dancers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, SRP things are way above my pay grade.  My only experience is being on the supplicant end of such systems, and until it can reject a loss with a caustic comment about the rigs still being in the cargo it isn’t there
