HP is currently the only online retailer I've found that has an RTX 5090 prebuilt gaming PC priced under $4,000. That's over $1,000 less than every other prebuilt 5090 configuration out there. You'll need to follow my directions to configure the options, and HP's estimated June 4 delivery seems pretty optimistic, but if you're bent on getting one of these cards then you have to put in the effort.HP Omen 45L RTX 5090 Prebuilt Gaming PC for $3,996HP Omen 45L Intel Core Ultra 7 265K RTX 5090 Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)Follow the directions below to properly configure this PC:Click HereSelect Graphics Card - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 (+$1,600)Select Chassis - Front Bezel Black Glass and 1200W Power Supply (+$60)Proceed to shopping cart and apply 10% off code \"PC10DEAL\"Price should show as $3,995.99 shipped (plus tax)The RTX 5090 Is the Most Powerful Graphics Card EverThe Nvidia 50-series GPUs were officially announced at CES 2025. Although this time around Nvidia has prioritized adding AI features and DLSS 4 technology to improve gameplay performance over the previous generation GPUs, the RTX 5090 has still emerged as the most powerful consumer GPU on the market even if you only factor hardware-based raster performance. This card boasts a 25%-30% uplift over the RTX 4090 and with 32GB of GDDR7 VRAM.The Omen 45L is HP's Flagship Gaming ChassisThe Omen 45L is HP's flagship gaming PC and, in our opinion, one of the best prebuilt gaming PCs. This is HP's roomiest chassis with plenty of cooling in the form of four 120mm fans for system airflow and an additional 240mm to 360mm all-in-one liquid cooling solution for the CPU. This PC is equipped with a generous 1,200W 80Plus Gold power supply and current-gen components like an Intel Z790 motherboard, Kingston FURY DDR5 RGB memory modules, and a WD Black M.2 SSD. The chassis itself looks great with its blend of steel and tempered glass and RGB lighting. Although it certainly exudes a very premium feel, it doesn't scream \"gamer\" like some other PC cases.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
