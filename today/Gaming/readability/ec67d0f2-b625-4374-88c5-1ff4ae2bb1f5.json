  "text": "The end is nigh for developer FuturLab's endlessly hypnotic original PowerWash Simulator, but before the studio packs away its nozzles in anticipation of an upcoming sequel, there's one last free update featuring a couple more spaces in which to unleash your hose. \"The time has come to reach our final destination for PowerWash Simulator,\" FuturLab wrote in an update on its website, \"and what a journey it has been!... Whether you've been with us busting the grime from early access, or hopped aboard the PowerWash hype train somewhere down the line, we'd love to say a huge thank you for enjoying this adventure with us.\" And as a final farewell to the original game, FuturLab has released Muckingham Files 6, which features two more locations in desperate need of a clean. The first will be immediately familiar to old hands, taking players down into the Muckingham subway station for one last spray. However, rather than demanding a repeat of the harrowing tunnel clean-up job featured in the base game, this time you'll be aiming your nozzle at an extremely grubby train that's pulled into the station, washing away the grime from its outers and innards. PowerWash Simulator | The Muckingham Files 6 Release Trailer Watch on YouTube After that, there's one last stop in the form of Sculpture Park, where players will be working at the behest of Darcy d'Arcy to restore the area's collection of \"fine\" art - including a large Monolith and The Man of A Thousand Faces - to its former glory. And, of course, there's a giant gnome, because what sort of send off would it be without one? \"We hope you enjoy this final PowerWash Simulator update as much as we have enjoyed creating it,\" FuturLab concluded in its update. \"The team have poured their hearts and souls into creating a world for you all to escape to and clean, somewhere for you to relax and solo clean, or a place to gather with friends and catch up over a satisfying wash.\" PowerWash Simulator's free Muckingham Files 6 update - which follows April's inclusion of Muckingham's Dessert Parlour for a cleaning - is available now on all platforms, and FutureLab has taken the opportunity to squeeze in a couple more bug fixes, as detailed in its patch notes. Next up, of course, is PowerWash Simulator 2, which is currently expected to launch for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and possibly Switch 2 later this year. It promises new jobs, new dirt to blast, and a new hub-like HQ. And if you're a fan of PowerWash Simulator's ridiculous narrative, don't fret - FuturLab has also confirmed plenty more Muckingham lore.",
