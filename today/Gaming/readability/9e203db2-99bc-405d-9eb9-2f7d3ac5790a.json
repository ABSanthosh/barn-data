The Outer Brood has arrived Downtime earlier day saw the expansion deployed to the live servers and since approximately noon Pacific time the expansion has been available. The opener for this expansion: High in the sky over the hills of the long-ignored Hodstock looms a massive behemoth. A creature so large that it appears to have an entire castle fortress on its back. Terrifying monsters fly down from that fortress. Huge reptiles with massive, deadly claws, fangs, and too many limbs. These beasts wield magic never seen on Norrath nor by any Norrathian. These creatures, dubbed the Outer Brood by the elders of the Circle of the Crystalwing, speak a form of Elder Dragon that even the oldest of dragons barely understand. At first, they seem to have come to parley with the dragons of Norrath, but conversation quickly turns to contempt, and there seems to be no stopping the battles to come. A horde of powerful creatures prepares to assault Norrath to cleanse the world of what their herald calls “A clear failure to follow scripture.” Norrath has faced assault before, but this time the foe is different. Some farseers have spotted what can only be dragons around the great leviathan as it floats at the top of the sky. Beings so large that few elder Norrathian dragons would stand above their knees! All around the massive leviathan flows a force that defies the understanding of any magic users of Norrath, with power exceeding anything they have seen before. Norrathians of all types, mortal and dragon, have banded together to face this unknown power and attempt to drive them back to wherever they came from. Can you lead the charge against such danger, one that has caused even the fiercest elders of the dragon clans to hesitate? What does that mean we’re going to get from the expansion? 6 Expansion zones – Explore a lost area between Freeport and Nektulos, then fly to a leviathan so large that dragons built a castle on top of it. New Raids, Quests, Collections, and Missions New Spells, Combat Abilities, and AAs New race and class combination: Dark Elf Ranger – For the first time, Dark Elves can be Rangers! Join the hunt and mercilessly stalk your prey as a Dark Elf Ranger. Available on progression servers once The Outer Brood opens. Activated Items Key Ring – A new key ring that accepts most nonexpendable items with activatable effects that are not already part of another key ring. Most of that is pretty standard, but again I ask what did Dark Elves do to deserve having the ranger class inflicted upon them?  Since the publication of The Lord of the Rings people have looked at Aragorn and said, “I want to be like that guy!  The ranger!” and TTRPG, MUD, and video game developers have responded to this desire by… making rangers suck pretty much universally. Or, if they don’t suck, then they are nothing like Strider, ending up more like Legolas as a fancy pants archer… but still kind of sucking. But that is me off on a tangent… there is probably a post on its own about that. If you want to buy the expansion the pricing follows the now standard for tiers: Standard Edition – $35 Collector’s Edition – $70 Premium Edition – $140 Family and Friends – $250 As always, the crazy price of the Family and Friends includes additional copies of the expansion that you can turn around and give or sell to people in game. And those who subscribe to Daybreak All Access get a 10% price break. Related: The Outer Brood launch announcement The Outer Brood expansion page The Outer Brood order page",
