  "text": "The Edge of Fate is a title that’s perhaps a bit too on the nose for a game balanced on a blade honed by years of iteration but also worn dull by time. In the storied and rich tradition of Destiny 2, this latest expansion once again takes a few major steps back after finally feeling like maybe it’d found its footing. The 14-mission campaign is monotonous and padded to the gills with busywork (despite having a sometimes-compelling story), the RPG and buildcrafting rework is locked behind one of the worst grinds Destiny has ever seen, and the new planetoid of Kepler isn’t up to Bungie’s usual standards. But even as it stumbles in its attempt to redefine itself after the excellent ending to its original story in The Final Shape last year, I do admire the risks The Edge of Fate takes, both in the bold new direction of its story and the unexpected mechanics it tries throughout its experimental campaign – though it doesn’t exactly nail either one. I still need to play through the raid before my final review, but the 20 hours I’ve spent with it so far feel like that messy spot the MCU was in after Endgame, fumbling for what comes next following a conclusion that felt pretty, well… conclusive.I wish I could say The Edge of Fate picks up where The Final Shape left off, or that it can easily be enjoyed on its own, but both of those are extremely not true. If you haven’t been playing every little scrap of seasonal content in the past year, you’ll certainly be off to a rocky start – there’s a new antagonist wearing the face and voice of an old character, godlike beings formerly relegated to vendors and goofy gameshow hosts who have been repositioned as omniscient puppetmasters who we’re now supposed to take seriously, and about 30 minutes of nearly nonstop info dumping, which feels like something out of a pulp sci-fi novel as voices explain how “dark matter” is totally different from “the darkness” and other such gobbledygook. It’s such a terrible opening, I feared the worst for a series that’s missed the storytelling mark more often than it’s hit by a pretty wide margin. But a weak first couple of hours makes way for a tale that was actually much better than I was expecting thanks to a very strong new supporting character in Lodi, who is shrouded in a mystery involving time travel, and a completely unexpected backstory finally given to one of Destiny’s longstanding cast members that really blew me away. Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate ScreenshotsThere’s still plenty of wonky dialogue, less interesting characters like Orin who mostly just fill space, and an overreliance on established lore across over a decade of content that can leave even longtime fans scratching their heads – plus, in an effort to make the new baddie intimidating, they do one of my biggest story pet peeves and retcon it so that actually all of the stuff that’s ever happened was all part of their master plan (insert massive eyeroll here). But on the whole, this is one of the better stories Destiny has pulled off, and I’m especially impressed by how many massive swings are taken to make me care about the next saga in this weird universe. This is perhaps best showcased by Lodi, who manages to effortlessly feel like an invaluable part of the cast despite literally showing up out of nowhere.The actual campaign, and especially the planet it takes place on, fare less well though. Kepler is Destiny’s first foray beyond the celestial bodies in our immediate solar system, so one might hope to marvel at places that feel new and alien, but instead we get an overly familiar setting that reuses assets we’ve seen a hundred times and slaps them onto loads of rocky cliffs and caves filled with big yellow warts. For an excursion that’s supposed to be a bold frontier that represents the future for the shooter, this is definitely one of the most lackluster settings they’ve added – to the point where I sometimes forgot The Edge of Fate was supposed to take place on a new planetoid. Seemingly in an effort to disguise how small the new area is, you aren’t allowed to summon your sparrow, which is instead replaced with a host of gimmicky abilities you have to use to access certain parts of the map, like one where you turn yourself into a tiny ball and squeeze through narrow passageways, Samus-style. This structure has the vaguest possible resemblance to a metroidvania, but usually only succeeds in making the trek back and forth to complete humdrum quests more irritating.The new abilities can interrupt the flow of combat in an odd way.Although these new abilities are generally irksome when they’re required to get around, they’re much more welcome in the context of solving puzzles during story missions. One such ability has you picking up a portal gun that lets you teleport to otherwise inaccessible areas, while another lets you shift the positioning of objects in the environment to create platforms or clear obstructions. So there are times where you find some loot just out of reach and have to use a combination of the Samus-ball and the other two to clear the way, which can be pretty neat. Unfortunately, these puzzles are so incredibly easy to solve they often feel more like busywork to artificially stretch out the adventure’s 8-hour runtime than anything of note, and since you can only use these abilities by finding specific nodes that grant you their power for a short time, I spent about 95% of my time running around searching for the tools needed to complete puzzles, and only the other 5% actually solving them.And even though I admire that Bungie has tried to incorporate these same tools into combat, they usually only serve to interrupt the flow in an odd way. For example, it’s really weird that in order to kill certain enemies or progress a boss to its next DPS phase, you’ve gotta turn yourself into a little ball of light and roll around collecting items while enemies absolutely lather you in gunfire you’ve little hope of dodging. This awkwardness is magnified by the fact that they reuse these three tricks nonstop throughout the journey on Kepler, and it starts to feel needlessly repetitive in pretty short order. Still, I’ve been saying for some time now that Destiny’s been resting on the laurels of its awesome gunplay for far too long and needs a shot in the arm to keep my interest, and these puzzle-forward abilities are at the very least an interesting attempt at doing just that, even if the execution is not always successful. Here’s hoping this is the prototype for something more engaging and fleshed out in future expansions.The wonky abilities and forgettable location aren’t the only reasons the 14 main missions in The Edge of Fate’s story are quite underwhelming though, as characters fill empty space with exposition as you fight bosses that are carbon copies of bad guys we’ve slain repeatedly throughout the years. To its credit, there are a few new enemies here and there, like flying aliens called corsairs and little robot bees that swarm you, but their impact on moment-to-moment gameplay is pretty minor when you spend 90% of the time shooting the exact same Fallen and Vex we’ve been murdering for over a decade. Even worse than the main missions though are the handful of side quests that have you literally retreading the same places you visited in story missions to scan objects and hear some more characters chatting over comms before learning you’ve completed the quest unceremoniously. Even for a game that has struggled to make interesting supplemental content, these are some of the most boring we’ve been subjected to, offering almost no benefit for completing them to boot.The biggest changes to Destiny 2 since The Final Shape are the reworks to guns and armor, which have been overhauled yet again. I’m not one of those players who frets when updates and power creep invalidate my hard-earned loadout, so I don’t actually mind most of the changes here. A new tier system provides extremely clear labels to just how good your loot is, so you can spend less time sweating over stuff you just dismantle, and adding set bonuses to armor is a feature I’ve craved in Destiny for many years that finally gives me a real reason to hunt for different armor sets instead of finding one good set and never taking it off. The problem is that, at least right now, there isn’t enough loot to chase, with just a handful of armor sets and a little over 30 weapons added to the pool at this point, so I didn’t feel much of an incentive to rip and replace my current loadout just yet.TieGuyTravis' Destiny RankingsTieGuyTravis ranks each Destiny expansion since the series's conception.The real issue is that even if I did feel compelled to hunt down the new gear available, the insane, painful grind to do so is in no way worth the effort required. Once you’ve completed The Edge of Fate’s campaign, you’re directed towards various playlists containing old content that you’re asked to replay over and over again, slowly upping your power level until you can complete activities that grant higher tier loot. What’s more, even these high level activities are just pulling from the exact same legacy content that has already been one of the main ways you’re expected to engage with Destiny 2 for years now. I was truly shocked to find that after I’d rolled credits on the new story, I was almost immediately loaded into a story mission from 2021. The new loot system has basically turned the endgame of Destiny 2 into an almost endless hamster wheel where you’re force fed the old content made arbitrarily more difficult based on the world tier and modifiers in play, all so you can get slightly better versions of existing weapons that have little use beyond (you guessed it) grinding more difficult versions of those same activities. Destiny has suffered through some pretty egregious grinds over the years, but this might just be the most brutal and ill-conceived one yet, and it almost immediately made me accept the fact that I’ll likely never have any high tier items until they decide to respect my time.The final activity on my checklist before slapping a final score on this review is to play the new raid, The Desert Perpetual, which at the time of this writing was only very recently beaten by the Destiny community’s brave day-one raiders. I’ll be hopping in shortly to see what pleasant surprises, if any, are to be found. For now, The Edge of Fate strikes me as incredibly just okay, with some new experiments that don’t always work, a neat story attached to a weak campaign, and some cool tweaks to the loot game that are hidden behind the most monstrous and boring grind Destiny has ever had.",
