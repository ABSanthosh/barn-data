  "text": "Image: Michael Kovac/Getty (Getty Images)If you, or the severed you who binge-watches television, need a refresher on Apple TV+’s breakout hit Severance, two of the main men behind it have you covered. Debuting on January 7, ten days before the show’s second season debuts, Severance executive producer Ben Stiller and the show’s leading man Adam Scott will host The Severance Podcast With Ben Stiller and Adam Scott. Suggested ReadingLive Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'Suggested ReadingThe Sci-Fi thriller, where Lumon employees separate their non-work memories (Outies) from their work memories (Innies) to terrifying results, has always been a playground of questions, entertaining viewers but bending their minds gently over nine episodes. When The Severance Podcast With Ben Stiller and Adam Scott debuts, it’ll launch with two episodes dedicated solely to the first season, with a new episode dropping every weekday through January 16. That’s nine episodes dedicated to unraveling this corridor maze of a show. After that, the pair will dig into the second season every Friday starting January 17.They’ll be joined by some other Lumon loyalists—Zach Cherry, John Turturro, and Britt Lower—as guests on the podcast, hopefully to give context to some of the wildest moments of the first season. Who choreographed the infamous dance scene? What’s the nature of Burt’s (Christopher Walken) and Irving’s (Turturro) relationship in the outside world? What does each of those weird rooms mean? We want answers now!Stiller, who told Collider he directed half of the second season’s episodes, says the new season will explore the relationship between the Innies and the Outies, especially through the lens of Scott’s character, Mark Scout.“We now have sort of opened up the world for the innies who have been on the outside world, so we felt like there was a responsibility to open up the story in that way and ratchet up the stakes and really dig into these relationships in terms of what Mark is dealing with in this very unique situation of the innie and the outie.”We may have to wait a little while longer for the new season of Severance, but Stiller says the third season is already in development. While we await the Great War of Innie vs. Outie vs Lumon vs. our collective sanity, Scott and Stiller’s new podcast should be the companion piece we all need.",
