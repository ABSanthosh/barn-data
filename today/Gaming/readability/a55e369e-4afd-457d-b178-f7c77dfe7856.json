  "text": "Diablo IVThe long-awaited celestial journey has returned! From February 4, 10 a.m.–February 18, 10 a.m. PST players in both Seasonal and Eternal Realms can bask in the moonlight of the Lunar Awakening limited-time event. A mysterious phenomenon is manifesting throughout the shrines of Sanctuary, enchanting them with immense and prosperous power. Celebrators attribute this behavior to their Ancestors blessing them from beyond the grave in commemoration of this joyous occasion. Activate any Shrine found in Sanctuary (Nahantu included) to earn 100% bonus experience (multiplicative) for 2 minutes and an enhanced power, all while earning Ancestral Favor Reputation. Lunar Awakening has Dawned To fully enjoy the revelry of Lunar Awakening, travel to Ked Bardu and head to the Northern section of town. Once there you’ll meet Ying-Yue, the leader of the Lunar Night Market. This market is your central hub for Lunar Awakening, where you’ll redeem your Ancestral Favor Reputation for Unceasing Gifts from the Ancestors caches and decorative Lunar Renewal-themed rewards. Lunar Shrines are spread throughout Sanctuary. Fight your way through both dungeons and the wilderness, activating Lunar Shrines and slaying monsters to earn copious amounts of Ancestral Favor Reputation. Lunar Shrines and Ancestors Favor Lunar Shrines hum with the auspicious powers granted to them by the returning spirits of ancestors. During Lunar Awakening, all Shrines have been replaced with Lunar Shrines—which bestow a 100% experience bonus when activated—with an updated appearance to honor the year of the snake! Lunar Shrines function similarly to typical Shrines, but they have been augmented for an extra punch to celebrate this festive event. These shrines also have a unique Map icon, so you can spot them from a distance. Lunar Shrines provide an exciting bonus effect on top of their regular Shrine power; the Lunar Shrine effects are listed below. Augmented Lunar Shrine Effects: Artillery Shrine – Casts have a chance to summon a holy bomb. Blast Wave Shrine – Each explosion summons a cluster bombardment. Channeling Shrine- Increased attack speed and chance to reset cooldowns. Conduit Shrine – Summon frequent, powerful, shocking strikes. Greed Shrine – Chance to summon a Treasure Goblin. While the Shrine is active, kills summon a Treasure Goblin. Lethal Shrine – Chance to instantly execute a struck monster, causing Fear on surrounding monsters. Note: this includes Elites, but excludes Bosses and other Players. Protection Shrine – You reflect all incoming damage. Damage reflected scales with Level and Difficulty. On top of these powerfully amplified effects, Miserly Spirits spawn immediately when a Lunar Shrine is activated, allowing you to immediately capitalize on the Shrines’ specific gameplay augmentation. Conquer Reputation Levels to Earn Rewards There are 10 Ancestral Favor Reputation Levels in total to earn with rewards such as a Resplendent Spark, and 6 different Lunar-themed cosmetic rewards to unlock, including the new Trag’Oul’s Consort mount*. Once you’ve climbed through the reputation levels, continue earning additional rewards in the form of Unceasing Gifts from the Ancestors. *Previous Lunar rewards such as the Lunar Scepter, Dragon’s Courage, Moonshot Bow, Dragon’s Tapestry, Moon’s Bounty, and Trag’Oul’s Consort cosmetics can only be earned once. Opulent Garments Await Lunar Awakening themed garments will also be available in Tejal’s shop. Head over to adorn your wanderer in elegant Armor Cosmetics like the Scholar of the Lonely Moon for the Sorcerer, and spruce up your trusty steed with the Dragon of the Lonely Moon mount armor. Celebrate with Ying-Yue and bask in the soft glow of Lunar Awakening when it arrives on February 4!",
