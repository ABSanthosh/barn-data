  "text": "We’re now getting into the 2024, end of year summaries portion of the annual blogging cycle, and the first up this year is Twitch, which has rolled out its 2024 recaps for all users. Twitch is Twitch Twitch has been fairly consistent in its presentation so I can do a reasonable year over year comparison.  And the up front, first metric is how many hours Twitch thinks I spent watching Twitch? All the hours Twitch says I spent nearly 600 hours watching people stream.  That is, of course, a lie… my eyes did not spend anything like that much time watching Twitch… but we’ll get to that in a bit. As a number though, that is a significant uptick from the past two years.  Let me just lay those out. 2024 – 599 hours 2023 – 325 hours 2022 – 214 hours Twitch did not include the total time in summaries before that, so we only have those three.  But the trend is clear, I have spent more and more time with Twitch up and running. And what have I been watching?  Mostly EVE Online… but also some other titles. My Twitch 2024 games The list is: EVE Online (top 10% of viewers!) World of Warcraft (retail) Throne and Liberty (Top 10% of viewers? Really? Guild Wars 2 Enshrouded (Also top 10% of viewers!) The astute observer might note that I do not even play three of those titles… or if I do, I have not bothered to post about playing them. What do these five titles have in common?  I mean, they are all MMOs… well, Enshrouded isn’t, but it has a similar vibe… so they fit in the niche of games I might play.  But what is the common thread? I gave this away in the post title, didn’t I?  Yes, they are all games that have features Twitch Drops this year. Twitch doesn’t give you a stat about the Twitch Drops you’ve earned, but they should because that would totally answer the question about why I watched those games. And when I write “watched” what I should really be writing is “opened them up in a browser tab, muted them, and stuck them in the background while I did something else, paying attention only in so much as I wanted to see if I had earned the currently available drop yet.” Twitch doesn’t do a very good job of even keep track of the drops you have earned.  They show a list that just goes back six months that doesn’t even indicate what game the drops were for.  Some you can tell which game… EVE Online items are easy to spot… while others… could be anything I guess. Which says something about me, that I’ll log in and earn drops for games I might play, which explains Throne and Liberty, Guild Wars 2, Once Human, retail WoW, and a few others. In the last six months I have earned… counting on my fingers and toes because they don’t give you a tally… 88 drops.  (I earned one while writing this post!) 43 of those drops over the last six months were for EVE Online, because CCP loves its streamers more than any other customer group by a huge margin.  Twitch doesn’t do a drops program for free.  CCP is laying out cash to do drops all the time, more than any other game I know about.  And drops are essentially a streamer subsidy program.  This is practically video game payola… if you’re old enough to know what payola was.  And when they aren’t subsidizing their streams, they are hiring them.  After all of that there is little love left in their hearts for bloggers, that is for sure. Or something. So I suspect, drops hound that I am, that I watched maybe a dozen hours total on Twitch, even if I was logged in for 599.  That doesn’t matter to Twitch or streamers or advertisers I suppose, but I always remember that when Twitch touts viewership.  I remember them claiming that a League or Legends tournament had more viewers than the Super Bowl… and that they counted anybody who viewed for even a few seconds and that the stream was live on their landing page, so every bot or mis-click that hit it counted. So it goes. Who did I watch?  My top five channels for 2024 were: Mind1 – 270 hours CCP – 74 hours zeh Pando – 39 hours CrashNaps – 23 hours TheCorrupted_TV – 13 hours All of those are primarily EVE Online streamers, though Mind1 does play some other games now and then, and I have earned unexpected drops by leaving his stream up in a tab.  But still, drops are the common denominator. So Mind1 is my go to channel for EVE Online drops.  It is also the channel only channel I actually subscribe to in the Twitch ecosystem, in part because he is the official DJ of the Imperium and Saturday Night Swarm events. That list of channels is a bit of a change up from past years.  It used to be that Mind1, CCP, and Imperium News were my consistent top 3.  However, Imperium News… well, frankly it got boring.  One does not have to “hand it” to The Mittani in any way, but he did put on a show.  With him gone Brisc, who played the straight man to Mitten’s antics, struggled to find somebody to carry that load before retiring himself.  It turns out that the show was mostly compelling because the leader of the Imperium used to get up there every week and goad our foes and cause them to foam at the mouth. So in tracking my top channels, Imperium News fell off the list.  Mind1 2024 – 270 hours 2023 – 101 hours 2022 – 30 hours 2020 – 29 hours  CCP 2024 – 74 hours 2023 – 84 hours 2022 – 76 hours 2020 – 9 hours Imperium News 2024 – ?? hours 2023 – 16 hours 2022 – 41 hours 2020 – 74 hours I will probably not bother with that set of numbers next year. Anyway, Twitch nicely wraps all of this up in a single infographic. Wilhelm Arcturus and Twitch 2024 Did you watch any Twitch this year?  Or did you leave it on in muted tab to collect drops?

– 13 hours\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of those are primarily \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e streamers, though Mind1 does play some other games now and then, and I have earned unexpected drops by leaving his stream up in a tab.  But still, drops are the common denominator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Mind1 is my go to channel for \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e drops.  It is also the channel only channel I actually subscribe to in the Twitch ecosystem, in part because he is the official DJ of the Imperium and Saturday Night Swarm events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat list of channels is a bit of a change up from past years.  It used to be that Mind1, CCP, and Imperium News were my consistent top 3.  However, Imperium News… well, frankly it got boring.  One does not have to “hand it” to The Mittani in any way, but he did put on a show.  With him gone Brisc, who played the straight man to Mitten’s antics, struggled to find somebody to carry that load before retiring himself.  It turns out that the show was mostly compelling because the leader of the Imperium used to get up there every week and goad our foes and cause them to foam at the mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo in tracking my top channels, Imperium News fell off the list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e Mind1\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2024 – 270 hours\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2023 – 101 hours\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2022 – 30
