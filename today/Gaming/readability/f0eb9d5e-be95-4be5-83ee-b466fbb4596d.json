  "text": "Just don't expect much from the trailer Image credit: HoYoVerse I'm not sure how they have time for it, but as part of a livestream held earlier today, HoYoVerse revealed yet another new game. This one isn't a completely new world, it's actually another Honkai game, though right now it doesn't have a name. A very short teaser was shared for it which literally just called it a \"brand new Honkai game\", but there were a couple of signs that it was one anyway. Namely, the presence of a couple of characters, Kiana and Blade. Kiana isn't from Star Rail, she's from Impact 3rd, one of the main characters in fact, and Blade is a playable character in Star Rail, so it seems like there's a bit of a crossover going on here. The teaser doesn't have a lick of gameplay, it's just a pre-rendered cutscene, but I think it's a safe bet on being some kind of Pokemon clone. New Honkai Game announced byu/Vegetable-Feedback11 inHonkaiStarRail When Kiana rocks up she's accompanied by the most gelatinous looking dog creature you've ever seen in your life. Blade also has a dog thing with him, though his one's a bit cooler, and the two dogs are shown charging towards each other for a fight. You can see a couple of other characters that also have their own critters with them, so, this really does come across as HoYoVerse starting to stake their claim on Pokemon's cash cow. There's as strong possibility of the game being named Honkai: Nexus Anima as the fan-run account Star Rail Universe found that a bunch of Twitter accounts have been registered with that name. I guess we'll have to wait and see on that one. Pokemon doesn't seem like the only game that HoYoVerse is going after, as there's been leaks and other social media accounts spotted to do with a game that might be in the vein of Stardew Valley. This is what I mean about them being so busy! Guess they really just want to have a game for every genre.",
