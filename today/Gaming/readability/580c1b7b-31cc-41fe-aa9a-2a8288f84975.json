  "text": "Enter this brave new world on February 14, 2025.At D23 Brazil, Marvel release a brand new trailer for Captain America: Brave New World that gives fans their best look yet at Harrison Ford's Red Hulk.The trailer starts off with Sam Wilson talking to Isaiah Bradley after his surprising attack on Harrison Ford's President Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross. We get a good glimpse at the action to come on February 14, 2025, but perhaps none of the footage was as exciting as the end where we get to see Ross become Red Hulk and getting ready to fight Wilson. This trailer follows the last one that not only blew up the White House, but also confirmed that the origin of adamantium in the MCU is from the body of Eternals' Celestial Tiamut from the middle of the ocean. Marvel also shared a new poster that shows Cap and Red Hulk facing off, and you can check it out below.For more, check out who Giancarlo Esposito is playing in the film and the latest Thunderbolts* trailer that reveals who bought Avengers Tower.Have a tip for us?
