  "text": "Image: Kinetic GamesCass Marshall is a news writer focusing on gaming and culture coverage, taking a particular interest in the human stories of the wild world of online games.Phasmophobia, the wildly popular co-op ghost hunting game, has been blowing up on Twitch since at least 2020, and developers Kinetic Games said Monday that it’s sold more than 22 million copies so far. In 2025, the team has a jam-packed developmental roadmap, including plans for an updated look for its famously nondescript player character models. Here’s what we know about the updates and upgrades slated for later this year, which were detailed Monday in a news release.The first major update for Phasmaphobia this year is called the Chronicle update, and it was detailed previously in a developer blog post. Kinetic says it will revamp how players gather evidence — things like spectral temperature fluctuations and eerie sounds, which will now be archived for the first time. To that end, the Chronicle update will replace the Photos tab with a Media tab. It should be especially handy if, in the midst of a particularly hectic haunting, one of your friends was busy wailing, arguing, or otherwise audibly panicking.Developers said there will be more nuance to data collection as well. The first capture of any media type will be marked as Unique, and will come with big rewards at the end of a contract. Duplicate pieces of media will reward much less, which encourages players to try different tools to create a wide portfolio of different pieces of evidence.Sometime after the Chronicle update comes the Player Character Overhaul. Currently, players can only pick one of a handful of avatars, none of which has a ton of personality. The road map shows a figure wearing different shirts, which could mean players will be able to customize their threads and swap outfits between contracts. It would be a welcome change to the current status quo, which has everyone wearing plain button-down shirts and other simple, sensible, forgettable clothes.Later in the year, Kinetic also said it would be releasing a brand new map. It will be small, they said, “akin to the houses” that already exist in the game. Additional changes will be made to existing maps. Specifically, the Bleasdale and Grafton Farmhouses will get major updates, overhauling the layout and creating new rooms for ghosts to haunt. There are also teases of holiday updates for Easter and Halloween, and even some 2026 features, including one thing called “Horror 2.0” that certainly piques my interest.",

Kinetic says it will revamp how players gather evidence — things like spectral temperature fluctuations and eerie sounds, which will now be archived for the first time. To that end, the Chronicle update will replace the Photos tab with a Media tab. It should be especially handy if, in the midst of a particularly hectic haunting, one of your friends was busy wailing, arguing, or otherwise audibly panicking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/unnamed-2.png?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0,0,100,100\" data-pswp-height=\"1002\" data-pswp-width=\"1782\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-chromatic=\"ignore\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" sizes=\"(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px\" srcset=\"https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/unnamed-2.png?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/unnamed-2.png?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/unnamed-2.png?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/unnamed-2.png?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/unnamed-2.png?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/unnamed-2.png?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/unnamed-2.png?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/unnamed-2.png?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/unnamed-2.png?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/unnamed-2.png?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/unnamed-2.png?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/unnamed-2.png?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/unnamed-2.png?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/unnamed-2.png?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/unnamed-2.png?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=2400 2400w\" src=\"https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/unnamed-2.png?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=2400\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eDevelopers said there will be more nuance to data collection as well. The first capture of any media type will be marked as Unique, and will come with big rewards at the end of a contract. Duplicate pieces of media will reward much less, which encourages players to try different tools to create a wide portfolio of different pieces of evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSometime after the Chronicle update comes the Player Character Overhaul. Currently, players can only pick one of \u003ca href=\"https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Player\"\u003ea handful of avatars\u003c/a\u003e, none of which has a ton of personality. The road map shows a figure wearing different shirts, which could mean players will be able to customize their threads and swap outfits between contracts. It would be a welcome change to the current status quo, which has everyone wearing plain button-down shirts and other simple, sensible, forgettable clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLater in the year, Kinetic also said it would be releasing a brand new map. It will be small, they said, “akin to the houses” that already exist in the game. Additional changes will be made to existing maps. Specifically, the Bleasdale and Grafton Farmhouses will get major updates, overhauling the layout and creating new rooms for ghosts to haunt. There are also teases of holiday updates for Easter and Halloween, and even some 2026 features, including one thing called “Horror 2.0” that certainly piques my interest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
