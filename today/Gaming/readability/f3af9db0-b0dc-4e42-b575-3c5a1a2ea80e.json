If you're a physical collector, you know that 4K Blu-rays are the best way to watch your movies at home. However, in recent years, these Blu-rays have gotten more expensive than ever. During Prime Day, you can score three 4K Blu-rays for the price of 2. That's one 4K Blu-ray completely free of charge! If you've been looking to build your sci-fi movie collection, this is the perfect time. There are plenty of 4K Blu-ray discounts outside of this promotion, but if you're a fan of sci-fi, this sale has it all.Get 3 Sci-Fi Blu-rays for the Price of 2Our favorite 4K Blu-rays included in this deal include Blade Runner: The Final Cut, which is still today one of the most influential sci-fi movies ever made. Starring Harrison Ford, this classic movie directed by Ridley Scott is still a must-see for any fan of the genre. Another incredible movie included in this collection is Back to the Future: The Ultimate Trilogy. Not only do you get the first Back to the Future film, but both Part II and Part III are also included in this trilogy set. Even today, I still think this is one of the best film trilogies ever created, and Prime Day is a great time to add this one to your collection.Finally, I also recommend Alien: Romulus, which was a big surprise for me in 2024. The visuals are excellent, the cast is great, and the suspense is everything you'd want from a horror film. There are many more sci-fi films available as part of this collection, so be sure to check out the full sale for more.
