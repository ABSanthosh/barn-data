The two-hour presentation, which you can watch above, rips open the new packs to reveal everything from Chocobos to luscious land cards inspired by famous Final Fantasy locations.While Wizards previously unveiled cards for the set back in February, the PAX East walkthrough gives fans a clearer idea of not just what they’ll see in the summer-release set, but how they’ll play.On top of deep dives on the cards, Wizards also announced the return of acclaimed series artist Yoshitaka Amano, who illustrated this new take on Kefka for the set, among many other cards.Magic: The Gathering — Final Fantasy is the latest tie-in set for Wizards, which now boasts crossovers with everything from Lord of the Rings to Marvel and Spongebob. The release is expected to be massive — and not slowed down at all by economic shake-ups throughout the world, according to Hasbro’s chief executive Chris Cocks. In April, Cocks said Final Fantasy was already the best-selling set in MTG history.And yet we’re still a month away from release.
