  "text": "EVE Fanfest 2025 has come and gone, the game had its 22nd birthday, and we’re off to the races with a new expansion slated to land on May 27th. EVE Fanfest 2025 I did not attend EVE Fanfest… Vegas apparently being as far as I’ll travel for a video game event… but I did watch what I could, a process somewhat hindered by the fact that I live in California so much of what went on occurred while I was asleep.  The perils of living on a sphere I suppose. But I have been paying attention, watching replays, and trying to get a hold on what went on at the party at the top of the world. Anyway, here on the Monday after I have some notes to share.  This isn’t fully formed, and I reserve some level of judgement on the new expansion until we get further details, but here is what I have. The Keynote I am sure somebody out there feels I put too much weight on this particular 90 minutes of the event.  But it is CCP’s chance to set the tone and I pay close attention to it… and things like how much time they let Hilmar stand out there tell his story versus the story of the game. More importantly, to me at least, it is how much time them spend telling everybody how great everything in the game is versus what they have planned.  The more time spent on that the weaker they tend to be on the future, the less confident they actually appear about the game. Again, my point of view.  I don’t mind them talking about what has happened.  I like the stats and the history.  In fact, I want them to do a post of page on the web to cover the history panels they had out on display at the Harpa. Each year’s highlights covered… I must see these! I dig that shit and want more.  This is a game where history matters, where we’ll never get a “classic” server in part because the important events were all player driven.  It isn’t like WoW or EverQuest where it is the same milestones just played through at 2x speed.  You wouldn’t get another B-R5RB battle or a World War Bee.  And the history matters.  What is happening today was due to what came before. So I was good with their balance this time, with both reveals and general plans as well as some looking back on what happened in the game, including them hitting on the Guinness Records people about the big move from Delve to Tenerifis. Finally, while they keynote was for all of CCP’s ventures, some of which make me a bit grumpy, EVE Online got its due.  It did not feel like they were trying to kick it to the curb as fast as possible to talk about their first person shooter plans or their blockchain crypto scam game. Overall, a good outing, would watch again.  And you can find it on YouTube. So that is something I think went well, and I say that as possibly CCP’s harshest critic when it comes to the keynote. The Legion Expansion As noted, final judgement reserved until we have more details.  But my general impression is that it looks good.  Or good enough. Two new ships, a Triglavian marauder and an Angel Cartel dreadnought, a balance pass through dreads, which are the core of the capital meta right now, some love to cruisers… though a new model for the Scimitar makes me uncomfortable, as I have always like the old design… and a bunch of other tidbits that could improve things. Some cruiser things There is always the law of unintended consequences to deal with in EVE Online.  Players, as I have said in the past, will flow like water through any holes in the plan on the way to the min/max optimization of the new meta. I want to listen to the Legion keynote again, as I breezed through it the first time as I re-ran the Twitch stream, which is always annoying.  But it is up and available on YouTube now as well. In addition, the moribund EVE Online press came back to life, if briefly, as Redline over at the New Eden Post wrote up a summary of the expansion that you should go check out. (Oh, EN24 awoke from its slumber as well.  Not a peep from Imperium News however.) Find it here or at the bottom of the post. Renewed Focus on New Players This is always something that CCP is anxious about, and probably all the more so since they fixed the AIR Career Program, so the stats don’t show quite as many fresh characters being created these days. As a bonus, CCP has finally let go of the idea that the tutorial is where the problem is.  That 30 minutes was never going to make or break the game.  I mean, at the peak of the game’s growth, back in 2006 and 2007, the tutorial was arguably garbage.  So no more throwing resources down that well.  The tutorial is fine. They are also going to skip right over the career agents, which could use a bit of work, but which are not awful.  They do train you how to do a few things. Instead, they are looking for was to bring new players into the community of corporations that make up the life’s blood of the game.  This goes right back to that slide from Fanfest 2014. New Player Trajectory Those who follow the solo/mission path hit a plateau and leave.  Those who end up in player groups tend to remain, or leave and come back due to the social bonds formed. The plan is to expand the corporation projects, a feature set about which I have been some what tepid in the past, to include a feature they are calling “freelance jobs” to become part of the equation. This will allow players to run jobs for corporations before they join.  It is a bit of a two way tryout.  They can be PvE or PvP and the hope from CCP is that a player driven incentive system to get people to join corporations might be the spark they need. And I like the initiative.  The plan is absolutely fraught with possible issues and abuses and makes some assumptions, but it doesn’t seem totally off base.  I really need to see more details around this… and then probably see it working for six months or a year as CCP makes adjustments… before I’ll be fully confident in it.  But it does at least build on all that corp mission stuff that has been showing up for the last few expansions and give it a sharper point. The Map I already wrote a whole post about the map, didn’t I?  Yes I did!  You can find it here. The map changes excite me, and all the more so that they seem to have taken to heart almost everything I was on about when relating what you get from an external map like DOTLAN versus either of the now aging in-game maps. This is also a new player thing.  As I noted, they straight up said they never tell new players about the map during the tutorial or career missions.  The map is difficult and scary and frankly not all that helpful even when you’ve mastered it. I have to temper my enthusiasm for this particular project.  I know with Legion we’re only getting baby steps, an attempt to make the current map(s) more user friendly.  But it is the future they painted that has me interested.  They showed a logical connection map, akin to DOTLAN. The map that shows you what you need to know But they also have a view planned… once again, somewhat akin to DOTLAN… to help you figure out jump drive travel plans. Where can I go with my 6ly jump range? And then just to pour some gasoline on my enthusiasm and turn it into a bonfire, they talked about maybe making the map capable of doing things like battle reports. Battles of New Eden visible within New Eden And they slipped in the idea that it could display historical battle reports, that you could go back in time to see what happened in a given system on a given day. Given how I said above about how EVE Online is built on its history, the idea of reclaiming that history, owning it and making it available within the game is huge.  Right now that sort of history is mostly in the domain of the players and third party tools.  And that is fine as far as it goes, but kill boards and blogs and battle reports site, they go away after a stretch.  There are critical bits of the history of New Eden that are archived away on fan sites that could just go away tomorrow if somebody decides they’ve had enough or have moved on. I have always been a bit bothered by how much CCP relies on its fan ecosystem to keep the stories alive.  Doing something to preserve the history of New Eden makes me happy. Of course, now I’ve pinned my hopes on this grand new venture and CCP is still a small company and can only do so much… but we live in hope. Pokemon Go Finally, I want to give a shout out to Epithos, who sent me their Pokemon Go friend code from Fanfest and sent me postcards in the game from Harpa and the EVE monument. Pokemon… no matter where you go, there it is So it goes.  Now CCP has to deliver on all of this, starting with the Legion expansion later this month.

want to listen to the Legion keynote again, as I breezed through it the first time as I re-ran the Twitch stream, which is always annoying.  But it is up and available on YouTube now as

fresh characters being created these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a bonus, CCP has finally let go of the idea that the tutorial is where the problem is.  That 30 minutes was never going to make or break the game.  I mean, at the peak of the game’s growth, back in 2006 and 2007, the tutorial was arguably garbage.  So no more throwing resources down that well.  The tutorial is fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are also going to skip right over the career agents, which could use a bit of work, but which are not awful.  They do train you how to do a few things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, they are looking for was to bring new players into the community of corporations that make up the life’s blood of the game.  This goes right back to that

path hit a plateau and leave.  Those who end up in player groups tend to remain, or leave and come back due to the social bonds formed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plan is to expand the corporation projects, a feature set about which I have been some what tepid in the past, to include a feature they are calling “freelance jobs” to become part of the equation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will allow players to run jobs for corporations before they join.  It is a bit of a two way tryout.  They can be PvE or PvP and the hope from CCP is that a player driven incentive system to get people to join corporations might be the spark they need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I like the initiative.  The plan is absolutely fraught with possible issues and abuses and makes some assumptions, but it doesn’t seem totally off base.  I really need to see more details around this… and then probably see it working for six months or a year as CCP makes adjustments… before I’ll be fully confident in it.  But it does at least build on all that corp mission stuff that has been showing up for the last few expansions and give it a sharper point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Map\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI already wrote a whole post about the map, didn’t I?  Yes I did!  You can find it here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe map changes excite me, and all the more so that they seem to have taken to heart almost everything I was on about when relating what you get from an external map like DOTLAN versus either of the now aging in-game maps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is also a new player thing.  As I noted, they straight up said they never tell new players about the map during the tutorial or career missions.  The map is difficult and scary and frankly not all that helpful even when you’ve mastered it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to temper my enthusiasm for this particular project.  I know with Legion we’re only getting baby steps, an attempt to make the current map(s) more user friendly.  But it is the future they painted that has me interested.  They showed a logical connection map, akin to DOTLAN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_134645\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

built on its history, the idea of reclaiming that history, owning it and making it available within the game is huge.  Right now that sort of history is mostly in the domain of the players and third party tools.  And that is fine as far as it goes, but kill boards and blogs and battle reports site, they go away after a stretch.  There are critical bits of the history of New Eden that are archived
