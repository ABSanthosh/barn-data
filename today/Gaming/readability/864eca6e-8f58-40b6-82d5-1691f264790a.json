  "text": "But Minecraft movie top grossing film of the year so far. Image credit: Rocksteady Warner Bros had a 48 percent decrease in games revenue last quarter, as it failed to release a single game. The company has released its latest earnings report, with the dip in revenue also owing to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League failing to meet expectations on its release last year, as well as strong carryover sales from the previous year of both the incredibly popular Hogwarts Legacy and Mortal Kombat 1 making for a tough comparison. So why no games? Back in March, it was reported the company cancelled a planned expansion to Hogwarts Legacy, in addition to plans for a Definitive Edition with all content. We Played Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League - but is it any good? We Played Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League - but is it any good?Watch on YouTube The expansion was never officially announced, but was reported by Bloomberg last year. Reportedly, it was cancelled due to the extra content not being substantial enough to justify its price. Additional content for Suicide Squad has also now been curtailed, with the final Suicide Squad chapter released in January this year. The full game remains playable both online and offline, though fans complained its final addition was a cheap conclusion to the story. After launch, the game failed to meet sales expectations and reportedly flopped due to an ill-suited genre pivot, a constantly shifting vision, and a culture of perfectionism. The studio, Rocksteady, suffered layoffs as a result, but is now reportedly working on a new single-player Batman game. Warner Bros also cancelled its Wonder Woman game and ended support for live-service brawler Multiversus, closing Monolith Productions and Player First Games in the process. All of this has led to a quarter with no game releases from a major publisher. Its next release will be Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 - one of many launch games arriving alongside Nintendo's new console Still, the company is doing alright when it comes to films. In a letter to shareholders, the company described Warner Bros. Motion Pictures as recently \"demonstrating strong momentum\", driven largely by the massive success of A Minecraft Movie. The game adaptation has grossed almost $900m globally since launch, with over $300m generated in its first weekend. It's the top grossing film of 2025 to date. The film will be available digitally later this week.",
