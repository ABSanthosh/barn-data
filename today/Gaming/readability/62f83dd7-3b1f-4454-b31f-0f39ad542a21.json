  "text": "As previously noted, I had finished up in Helm’s Deep, at least to the extent I could.  I saw the great battle and the caves and all the stuff, including having to play an orc to get that perspective on how things played out.  It was quite epic. I swear, it was like that when I got here… I never could get that last epic quest back to complete it.  But my goal is to get to Mordor, not to finish every quest, so I moved on. I went to the Old Forest and to the now ruined Isengard where nobody was around, save for the stable master.  I swear, stable masters are the unsung heroes of middle earth. You can get a ride in the midst of desolation There I met Quickbeam again and ran around the now flooded Isengard… I found it somewhat comic that there is an updated map for the flooded version, like some Middle-earth scribe is out there hurriedly updating maps to suit changes… and even ran into  Treebeard.  If you don’t get to meet ALL the principals then you might feel short changed I guess. You might remember me from a forest adventure with some hobbits! The problem with the ents… in literally every rendering I have ever seen… is they do not match the image in my head that were set there when I was 15.  I can deal with Aragorn changing looks and armor and whatever in all those Tolkien art homages, but ents just never quite get there for me.  But I did get to see Orthanc in its full, if water logged, glory. Good luck storming the tower Anyway, I cleaned up debris in Isengard a bit, then went to the forest where I did some ent tasks for Quickbeam.  But I was well over level for that and once I had raised my standing with them enough to trade in a bunch of leaves for the travel skill to the forest, I was out of there. But where to next?  The way to Mordor passes through Gondor, so Gondor was the obvious destination.  But the game’s story line doesn’t put you with Gandalf, who rides Shadowfax to Gondor.  You might slow him down.  You don’t get to go with Theodan and the host of Rohan.  They only show up at the end of the battle anyway.  You can’t even wait around for Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli… you’ve got work to do to help Gondor prepare.  Somebody’s lost goats need to be found before the battle I am sure.  So you are on your own.  And the only quest I had leading me out of there sent me to Dunharrow. Back to Dunharrow!  Fortunately I had set that as my campfire fast travel spot… hunter travel skills are the best… so I was soon back there and ready to face the Paths of the Dead. Because, of course, how else are you going to get anywhere from Dunharrow.  Also, the game had shown me the door not once but twice already. When I first arrived in Dunharrow there was a quest that was basically “Go find the spooky skull door literally 100 yards behind our shanty town!”  As foreshadowing goes, it was not subtle.  However, it was also a while back, so later Eowyn is all “Hey, I hear there is something cool back in the woods” and you have to follow her, once again, to the door. Like you haven’t been here before… I’m pretty sure she used to bring her boyfriends there to make out during her goth phase back in whatever passed for Edoras Central High School.  I mean, she knew the way.  No hesitation. So, yeah, by the time I arrived back in Dunharrow again the game had established “skull door just down the road.” That certainly is a dark door… Now, as I arrived, some guy named Waldere tells you that some of his friends got drunk and went through the door on a dare or some nonsense story and asks if a big strong hero like yourself couldn’t do something about it.  Of course you will, the story demands it, even if Waldere is pretty flippant about the whole thing. Good luck storming the dark door! Even the game tells you that you’ve been here before. Do I get frequent door visit points? This time you have to go through the door and on the other side… well, there are the dead… who honestly, are not that big of a deal.  Again, I was level 99 by that point, so I was starting to out level the place, but still the reputation that had been built up that the place just was not sustaining. Anyway, I found Waldere’s friends.  Granted, two were dead, but I saved the third guy, fought the dead, explored a bit, and got out safely. After all of that it is finally your turn to travel the Paths of the Dead, those dead who will not suffer the living save for the true heir of Isildur, through the dark paths… which takes about three minutes to walk through before you are out on the other side in Blackroot Vale. Welcome to Gondor… please have your passport ready This is where the Stone of Erech resides, where Aragorn will later summon the dead to fulfill their oaths and lead them on to the defense of Minas Tirith.  I didn’t think it would be a simple sphere.  I rather pictured it as a Gondorian middle-finger to remind the dead how they were regarded. Down in Blackroot Vale there are the usual settlements with their petty problems you need to help solve.  But the game also wants to tell you all about the dead, the stone, and the paths, so eventually you have to go back into those fearsome paths of the dead and explore a bit more. Yeah, yeah, can you just stamp my quest ticket? Also, whenever some dialog ends in your race, as a man I always hear the dialog in a half-baked hippie voice.  “Like, why do you have to keep hassling us man?  Can’t you just be cool?” Anyway, I did that, then went back and solved their other problems, then got moved along the quest chain until I ended up was down the road in Dol Amroth, home of Prince Imrahil and the Swan Knights.  It is also a major port city which believes in natural selection via a complete lack of handrails on stairs. Seriously, a person could fall off the edge here In Dol Amroth I spent some time building up some reputation with the locals by slaying the neighboring corsairs and helping to write an overwrought love poem that did not sway its intended target in the least.  Once again, I wanted to get to the rep level where I could get the Dol Amroth travel skill, which comes at the friend level.  A lot of places you get it at acquaintance, but the Armothians are a little more chilly to strangers I guess. Anyway, at friend you also unlock the ability to gain rep with the 97 competing factions in the city, each of which has its own set of daily quests that you can run.  So I picked one of the factions and got four quests that sent me back to the Paths of the Dead… which, at this point in my travels, was three zones over from Dol Amroth, so not exactly in the neighborhood. Furthermore, the quests were more of the variety of “The Paths of the Dead are kind of messy, could you go tidy them up a bit?  The leftover skulls are putting off the tourist trade.” So I went and cleaned up skulls, collected niknicks, pared down the dead population, and generally did path maintenance. They don’t even give you gloves to pick this up with So the trajectory of the Paths of the Dead in my various encounters went like this: Oooh, very, very scary, stay away! Still very scary, be wary! Can you rescue some people from the scary place? Travel through the mostly scary place! Establish some story point in the mildly scary place You are now the janitor of the place, which isn’t that scary after all This might be one of those “familiarity breeds contempt things. Anyway, fine.  I can farm the Paths of the Dead if needs be.  But then I got back to Dol Amroth and turned in the quests and all I got was freaking tokens to level up my rep with that faction.  No level xp, no virtue xp, no legendary item xp, not even a bit of crappy xp for my mount… though my mount was at level cap by that point.  I haven’t bothered to upgrade him. Well, I can only take so much of that nonsense.  I was already over level, I had my faction bump and my travel skill, so it was time to put Dol Amroth in the rear view mirror.  I went and looked at the zones by level page on the wiki and found that at level 101 I had several choices.  I decided to just get to Minas Tirith.  Might as well dispense with the side stories and get stuck right into things.  And somebody even knew my name there. Oh, there he is! That Gandalf, he’s always full of false bonhomie when he has some obnoxious favor to ask of you.  But at least I was going to get to see the big city.",

ent tasks for Quickbeam.  But I was well over level for that and once I had raised my standing with them enough to trade in a bunch of leaves for the travel skill to the forest, I was out of there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut where to next?  The way to Mordor passes through Gondor, so Gondor was the obvious destination.  But the game’s story line doesn’t put you with Gandalf, who rides Shadowfax to Gondor.  You might slow him down.  You don’t get to go with Theodan and the host of Rohan.  They only show up at the end of the battle anyway.  You can’t even wait around for Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli… you’ve got work to do to help Gondor prepare.  Somebody’s lost goats need to be found before the battle I am sure.  So you are on your own.  And the only quest I had leading me out of there sent me to Dunharrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack to Dunharrow!  Fortunately I had set that as my campfire fast travel spot… hunter travel skills are the best… so I was soon back there and ready to face the Paths of the Dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause, of course, how else are you going to get anywhere from Dunharrow.  Also, the game had shown me the door not once but twice already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I first arrived in Dunharrow there was a quest that was basically “Go find the spooky skull door literally 100 yards behind our shanty town!”  As foreshadowing goes, it was not subtle.  However, it was also a while back, so later Eowyn is all “Hey, I hear there is something cool back in the woods” and you have to follow her, once again, to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_135143\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

locals by slaying the neighboring corsairs and helping to write an overwrought love poem that did not sway its intended target in the least.  Once again, I wanted to get to the rep level where I could get the Dol Amroth travel skill, which comes at the friend level.  A lot of places you get it at acquaintance, but the Armothians are a little more chilly to strangers I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, at friend you also unlock the ability to gain rep with the 97 competing factions in the city, each of which has its own set of daily quests that you can run.  So I picked one of the factions and got four quests that sent me back to the Paths of the Dead… which, at this point in my travels, was three zones over from Dol Amroth, so not exactly in the neighborhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the quests were more of the variety of “The Paths of the Dead are kind of messy, could you go tidy them up a bit?  The leftover skulls are putting off the tourist trade.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I went and cleaned up skulls, collected niknicks, pared down the dead population, and generally did path

contempt things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, fine.  I can farm the Paths of the Dead if needs be.  But then I got back to Dol Amroth and turned in the quests and all I got was freaking tokens to level up my rep with that faction.  No level xp, no virtue xp, no legendary item xp, not even a bit of crappy xp for my mount… though my mount was at level cap by that point.  I haven’t bothered to upgrade him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I can only take so much of that nonsense.  I was already over level, I had my faction bump and my travel skill, so it was time to put Dol Amroth in the rear view mirror.  I went and looked at the \u003ca href=\"https://lotro-wiki.com/wiki/Zones_by_level\"\u003ezones by level page\u003c/a\u003e on the wiki and found that at level 101 I had several
