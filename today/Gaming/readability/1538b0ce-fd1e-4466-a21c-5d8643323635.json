Here’s the official synopsis:As the rest of America adjusts to Homelander’s iron fist, back at Godolkin University, the mysterious new Dean preaches a curriculum that promises to make students more powerful than ever. Cate and Sam are celebrated heroes, while Marie, Jordan, and Emma reluctantly return to college, burdened by months of trauma and loss. But parties and classes are hard to care about with war brewing between Humans and Supes, both on and off campus. The gang learns of a secret program that goes back to the founding of Godolkin University that may have larger implications than they realize. And, somehow, Marie is a part of it.Most of the cast is back for season 2, including Jaz Sinclair as Marie Moreau, Lizze Broadway as Emma, Maddie Phillips as Cate Dunlap, London Thor and Derek Luh as Jordan Li, Asa Germann as Sam Riordan, and Sean Patrick Thomas as Polarity. Tragically, Gen V season 1 star Chance Perdomo, who played the Magneto-like Andre, died in 2023 on his way to Toronto to film season 2. The production team had previously announced that they would not recast Perdomo’s role for season 2, and it seems the writers have incorporated his departure into Polarity’s arc.New to season 2: Hamish Linklater (Midnight Mass) as Dean Ciphe, a new villain who looks… absolutely punchable.Gen V season 2 will kick off with a three-episode premiere on Sep. 17.",
