  "text": "Image credit: Konami/Laced Records Last year's Silent Hill 2 Remake was stellar for many, many reasons, and composer Akira Yamaoka's gorgeous reworking of his nearly 20-year-old original soundtrack was undoubtedly one of them. So when you tell me the whole thing is being released as a fancy £125 six-disc vinyl edition, my power to resist - even as my bank balance screams in protest - is minimal. Konami's newly announced Silent Hill 2 Limited Edition Deluxe X6LP Boxset is beautiful in a so-putrid-you-can-almost-smell-it sort of way. Each inner sleeve features strikingly grimy artwork from developer Bloober Team's concept work, and each translucent disc - officially described as \"brown + red\" - has the lurid purple sheen of rotting meat. Delightful! Across the six discs - which are being released by Laced Records in collaboration with Konami - you get 93 tracks from last year's remake (I will inevitably be wearing a deep groove into Laura's Theme - Repetition) and there's 32-page art book featuring liner notes from Akira Yamaoka. Image credit: Konami/Laced Records And for those with far better impulse control than me, Laced is also releasing two alternate additions with fewer tracks and a smaller price tag. The Silent Hill 2 Double Deluxe Vinyl features an 'essential selection' of 27 tracks from Yamaoka's soundtrack across two \"black heavyweight\" LPs for £36, and there's also an Exclusive Edition Double Deluxe Vinyl version which is identical in content and price, but which comes on foggy hued \"milky clear\" discs. All three editions are set launch this October, and pre-orders are available now. And if you haven't already played Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 remake. Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake awarded it five stars in her review and it earned itself fourth place in Eurogamer's best games of 2024. All of which is incredibly encouraging for Bloober's next game, Cronos, an alternate history sci-fi horror partially set in 1980s Krakow.",
