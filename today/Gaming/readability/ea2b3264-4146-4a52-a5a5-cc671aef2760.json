  "text": "Last week I covered the announcement that the Imperium would be abandoning Delve and Querious to move eastward, with Goonswarm giving up UALX-3 in Tenerifis to setup a new home in C-J6MT in the Insmother region.  The region had been effectively conquered with PanFam falling back to Etherium Reach. Imperium move plans The Imperium just had to make all of that happen.  The big move was on. The Move out of Delve and Querious A lot of groups are moving as part of this next shift east,  Goonswarm is picking up and moving to Insmother.  Several groups in the south are shifting closer to the front lines.  But the first priority was helping move Brave, Lawn, IGC, and Dracarys move out of Delve and Querious… in seven days. This was probably the most criticized aspect of the whole plan, the need to evacuate those regions where approximately 15K characters live, according to the alliance rankings over at DOTLAN.  Granted, there are probably at least 4 real people per each capsuleer (in GSF it is about 6 to 1 given the forum accounts versus characters), but that is still a bunch of people with a sudden need to relocate. People were going to get left behind or have their stuff sent to asset safety.  But, as quickly became apparent, a bunch of people in Goonswarm hadn’t bothered to move their stuff last summer, so no matter how much time is allow, somebody is just going to delay.  The alliances there agreed to the plan… which they had known in advance would be the plan… so there was a week to make as much happen as we could. Moving service prioritize the routes out of Delve and Querious.  Move ops ran multiple times per day every day for a week getting people setup on one side of a regional gate via a cyno chain with titans to bridge people.  Then there were operations to cover the region gate crossings.  I was down with my Delve alt covering the region gate between TCAG-3 and G-M4GK three times during the week. Covering the gate in TCAG It was said at the Fireside late on Saturday afternoon (my time) that the special evac transport services moved more than 10 trillion ISK value in goods over the course of the week, a number that does not account for corp or other move services that were also carrying goods eastward.  Midway through the week KarmaFleet was asking for volunteer jump freighter pilots to help move goods as the contracts piled up. We’ll see if all of this gets another mention by CCP, but a lot of stuff was picked up and hauled off. The Big Scoop All of this led up to Saturday’s operation, dubbed “the big scoop.”  One of the reasons for the seven day move window was that is how long it takes to unanchor a structure.  So last week, when the evacuation of the two regions was announced all non-critical structures therein started their unanchoring cycle, with something in the range of 500 structures set to come down on Saturday the 21st.  Now we just had to… go pick them all up.  Or whatever was left. This was a prime point of exposure for the move.  All PanFam or anybody else had to do was go set the armor timer on these structures and the unanchoring would stop and that structure would be left behind, at which point it could be blown up at the attacker’s leisure.  We weren’t going to go back and defend Fortizar’s or Athanors or Raitarus. Hitting the shields and setting the armor timer isn’t a big chore, we do it all with 30-50 person bomber fleets.  And there were a lot of targets.  We expected a bloodbath as part of the price of our need to move. Still, we made plans to scoop as much as we could.  I managed to be on the list of people in the right channel to get in on the scoopening, not that I knew what to do.  But my main and my alt could fly the right ships, the Upwell hauler known as the Torrent, which has a bay for hauling structures, cores, and related materials. Three Torrents on tether at a Keepstar We were setup in a special purpose Discord server, now deleted, and given access to a Google sheet with a list of structures that were planned to be simply abandoned.  There were 300 on that list.  Alliances had other lists of structures they were going to take care of themselves (and, as it turned out, there was some overlap on the lists or they had some time so grabbed additional structures) so we were the cleanup crew to grab whatever we could lest it be left behind. A peek at the scoop list This, of course, was chaos because people kept sorting or hiding sections of the sheet, unaware that anything you do in the main view affects everybody else. I chose a Fortizar in Querious for my first pickup.  A Fortizar needs two Torrents, and I had my main and my alt, because the structure is big enough that you cannot fit it and the core in the same ship. So I flew out.  The Torrent is a deep space transport, so is slow and can’t warp cloaked.  But the ones they handed out had a warp core stabilizer and an interdiction nullifier fit, as well as a pretty beefy shield tank and an improved cloaking device.  That is enough to get you out of trouble if you think fast and do the right thing… but how often do I do that?  And we were expecting a lot of gate camps as well as camps on the structures by people looking for easy kills or to scoop structures and cores.  Those have some value. I ran my main first and my alt a few gates behind so they wouldn’t both get caught in the same trap and, sure enough, on my second gate there were two dictors who put up a bubble when I came through the gate.  I decloaked, started my align, hit the nullifier, then tried to warp… a slow process as the Torrent is a ponderous ship for a subcap… and was worried I had done it wrong.  The nullifier, which is there to defeat dictor bubbles, ran its cycle before I entered warp and I thought “welp, that was a short trip.” And then I entered warp and was on my way… and ran into no further problems.  The dictors had been scared off by the time my alt passed through that gate and hostiles seemed to be busy elsewhere. As it turned out, we had made a deal with The Initiative to help cover the scoop in return for some discount pricing on some structures.  They and our Control Alt Delve group… I had a pilot in that, so I was triple boxing, which is way beyond my capabilities so I am very lucky I didn’t get blown up… say on the stations in NPC Delve and chased down hostiles, keeping their interference down. I got to my Fortizar, which was still there, and waited the 30 minutes until it unanchored cloaked up about 300km off the structure. Waiting to scoop As I sat there somebody docked up in a Venture.  I warned them that the structure was set to unanchor at 20:00, which perturbed them as they were setting up some Venture cynos to get service their jump freighter.  I then said that there could be as many as 600 structures going away.  That set them to thinking.  And then, when the Fortizar collapsed into its unanchored state, they said that their jump freighter had been in the Fortizar and had just been sent to asset safety.  Oops. As usual, in any big organization at least 10% don’t get the memo about things like this.  Another freighter had docked during that time and got kicked out into space when the structure unanchored, a turn of events dubbed “inconvenient” by the pilot.  But at that point I had my task in progress. My objects on the overview I decloaked both Torrents and warped to the unanchored structure in space.  My alt picked up the core and the remaining modifications (there was a clone bay and a defense mod), both of which were in the hangar container, then turned to align to the out gate. With my main I was at the structure myself… and I couldn’t figure out how to pick it up.  I asked in coms, and there was a quick and simple answer… there is a “scoop to infrastructure hold” option on the right-click menu… but my confusion was largely due to CCP and their haphazard approach to UI design.  There are three “scoop to” options on the right-click menu, two together in the place you expect them, then the infrastructure option by itself at the bottom of the menu.  It was there for those examining closely, but for those like me who have to get close to the screen to even read those menus even with my reading glasses on it was another case of “why aren’t these organized by function?” (I have the same gripe about the “board ship” option, which they moved to the top of the menu, but the option to leave the ship is still buried deep in the menu.  Connected functions should be in the same location.) Anyway, I got it scooped. Fortizar scooped (I named the ship “Ice Cream” because it was all about the scoops.) I gated my way to the drop off Keepstar, put them in my hangar, and went back to the spreadsheet to find a nearby structure for my next run. Torrent heading towards the next gate There was another Fortizar on the list a few jumps away, but when I got there it was already gone.  I managed to pick up an Athanor that was sitting around, then motored off to a few more systems, only to find them mostly clear or covered by other haulers.  I set course back to the Keepstar again, only to have the autopilot routing get wonky because, among the structure being taken down, the Ansiblex jump bridge network was being pulled from all but essential routes.  The autopilot does not like when those go away mid-trip. Clearing the route and redoing it got me back on course and both Torrents safely arrived in the Keepstar, where I traded them back with my scooped stuff.  I hadn’t done very much, but I did my little part. At the fireside after the op Asher announced that we had scooped 95% of the structures on our lists, which was well beyond expectations.  We were, once again, counting on our foes behaving like we would.  If the situations were reverse we would have had bomber fleets roaming the region shooting structures just to set timers and disrupt the move.  Instead we faced some sporadic harassment and that was it. There was coordinated effort to drop some dreadnoughts on a freighter scooping a Keepstar… and it failed.  A few other structures, including a Sotiyo, got caught being moved, but it wasn’t like any sort of big effort was put together. The same went for the move ops over the week before the big scoop.  There were plenty of private operators out there camping gates, but nothing like a coordinated effort.  Hard Knocks Citizens put a Sleipner fleet up in TCAG to try and grab some juicy targets, but PanFam never bothered to go that far. As the meme goes, “we are not the same.” PanFam Moves Too PanFam wasn’t completely torpid during all of this.  They continue to entosis systems in Insmother now and then as a harassment campaign… made you form… but there is no follow through and certainly no attempt to retake any of Insmother.  They have written that off. They did have to react to us setting up shop on their doorstep, so announced that their new staging location would be E8-432 in Etherium Reach. The new staging announcement That was likely the correct answer to their new “Goons as neighbors” problem.  From that system they can cover Etherium Reach, The Spire, as well as chunks of Malpais, Perrigen Falls, and a bit of TKE. It would have been leadership malpractice to not make such a move given the new situation, so one must give them credit for that. The Last Chopper out of Saigoon There was a ceremonial last crossing of the gates as we covered capitals and freighters making the move from 49-U6U in Querious and into Catch. So it goes.  The Imperium is out of Delve and Querious, at least to the extent that we are not defending the sovereignty any further.  There are a few key structures in the regions, including the Keepstar at 1DQ1-A.  The latter will be getting its Viking funeral in the next week or two. There are still people moving… there is still stuff to be moved.  We are not completely free of the place yet.  There is a whole thing still going on in Period Basis.  All of that will linger for a few more weeks.  But the end is in sight. And then we will get to watch and see who will be moving in to the space.  The Initiative clearly wants to grab a corner, if only to have a place to operate from south of Fountain.  A couple other alliances have grabbed a system here and there. Also on the list of suitors, Legion of xXDEATHXx is said to be eyeing some of the space there, as is the Phoenix Coalition (Razor, Synergy of Steel, and Triumvirate), a group bound by treaty to act essentially as Winter Coalition’s pets.  Maybe some distance will free them from that yoke. (Though I might have misheard that.  It might be Phoenix Cartel that has some plans there.) The big wheel of null sec keeps on turning. The Imperium still has a lot of work ahead.  We got people over the new Imperium boarder, which extends now to G-M4GK in Paragon Soul and 4-07MU in Catch, the near side of the two regional gates that connect to the space just abandoned.  But we still have to sort out who is moving where within the new space and get people moved.  Goonswarm itself has to pick up its stuff in UALX-3 Tenerifis and carry it to C-J6MT in Insmother. I have to figure out what I am going to do.  Do I yank up all my PI… my only source of income… yet again and move it to Insmother?  Also, with the move coming people dumped their saved PI materials on the market and the priced dropped quite a bit.  Do I just let my PI go fallow?  Things to think about as I look at what I have in UALX and wonder why I still have so much crap after having moved just last fall. We’ll be at this all summer… and everybody won’t be settled even then. But Saturday was a watershed, and a success beyond expectations.  Asher had a titan conga line setup in C-J6MT as a bit of a post operation celebration. When titans conga, they do so slowly Brave had their own celebration as well, marking their somewhat brief tenure in Delve.  They remain the official victors of World War Bee however, being the only alliance to successfully take 1DQ1-A from Goons. As I write this on Sunday morning, there are already pings.  Things need to be done.  Stuff still needs to be moved.  Somebody is touching our stuff and needs to be chased off.  The coalition remains busy.  There is always something to do.",

unaware that anything you do in the main view affects everybody else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chose a Fortizar in Querious for my first pickup.  A Fortizar needs two Torrents, and I had my main and my alt, because the structure is big enough that you cannot fit it and the core in the same ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I flew out.  The Torrent is a deep space transport, so is slow and can’t warp cloaked.  But the ones they handed out had a warp core stabilizer and an interdiction nullifier fit, as well as a pretty beefy shield tank and an improved cloaking device.  That is enough to get you out of trouble if you think fast and do the right thing… but how often do I do that?  And we were expecting a lot of gate camps as well as camps on the structures by people looking for easy kills or to scoop structures and cores.  Those have some value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran my main first and my alt a few gates behind so they wouldn’t both get caught in the same trap and, sure enough, on my second gate there were two dictors who put up a bubble when I came through the gate.  I decloaked, started my align, hit the nullifier, then tried to warp… a slow process as the Torrent is a ponderous ship for a subcap… and was worried I had done it wrong.  The nullifier, which is there to defeat dictor bubbles, ran its cycle before I entered warp and I thought “welp, that was a short trip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I entered warp and was on my way… and ran into no further problems.  The dictors had been scared off by the time my alt passed through that gate and hostiles seemed to be busy elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it turned out, we had made a deal with The Initiative to help cover the scoop in return for some discount pricing on some structures.  They and our Control Alt Delve group… I had a pilot in that, so I was triple boxing, which is way beyond my capabilities so I am very lucky I didn’t get blown up… say on the stations in NPC Delve and chased down hostiles, keeping their interference down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got to my Fortizar, which was still there, and waited the 30 minutes until it unanchored cloaked up about 300km off the structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_136099\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

three “scoop to” options on the right-click menu, two together in the place you expect them, then the infrastructure option by itself at the bottom of the menu.  It was there for those examining closely, but for those like me who have to get close to the screen to even read those menus even with my reading glasses on it was another case of “why aren’t these organized by

was already gone.  I managed to pick up an Athanor that was sitting around, then motored off to a few more systems, only to find them mostly clear or covered by other haulers.  I set course back to the Keepstar again, only to have the autopilot routing get wonky because, among the structure being taken down, the Ansiblex jump bridge network was being pulled from all but essential routes.  The autopilot does not like when those go away mid-trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearing the route and redoing it got me back on course and both Torrents safely arrived in the Keepstar, where I traded them back with my scooped stuff.  I hadn’t done very much, but I did my little part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the fireside after the op Asher announced that we had scooped 95% of the structures on our lists, which was well beyond expectations.  We were, once again, counting on our foes behaving like we would.  If the situations were reverse we would have had bomber fleets roaming the region shooting structures just to set timers and disrupt the move.  Instead we faced some sporadic harassment and that was it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was coordinated effort to drop some dreadnoughts on a freighter scooping a Keepstar… and it failed.  A few other structures, including a Sotiyo, got caught being moved, but it wasn’t like any sort of big effort was put together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same went for the move ops over the week before the big scoop.  There were plenty of private operators out there camping gates, but nothing like a coordinated effort.  Hard Knocks Citizens put a Sleipner fleet up in TCAG to try and grab some juicy targets, but PanFam never bothered to go that far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the meme goes, “we are not

systems in Insmother now and then as a harassment campaign… made you form… but there is no follow through and certainly no attempt to retake any of Insmother.  They have written that off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey did have to react to us setting up shop on their doorstep, so \u003ca

system they can cover Etherium Reach, The Spire, as well as chunks of Malpais, Perrigen Falls, and a bit of TKE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would have been leadership malpractice to not make such a move given the new situation, so one must give them credit for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Last Chopper out of Saigoon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a ceremonial last crossing of the gates as we covered capitals and freighters making the move from 49-U6U in Querious and into Catch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it goes.  The Imperium is out of Delve and Querious, at least to the extent that we are not defending the sovereignty any further.  There are a few key structures in the regions, including the Keepstar at 1DQ1-A.  The latter will be getting its Viking funeral in the next week or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are still people moving… there is still stuff to be moved.  We are not completely free of the place yet.  There is a whole thing still going on in Period Basis.  All of that will linger for a few more weeks.  But the end is in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then we will get to watch and see who will be moving in to the space.  The Initiative clearly wants to grab a corner, if only to have a place to operate from south of Fountain.  A couple other alliances have grabbed a system here and there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso on the list of suitors, Legion of xXDEATHXx is said to be eyeing some of the space there, as is the Phoenix Coalition (Razor, Synergy of Steel, and Triumvirate), a group bound by treaty to act essentially as Winter Coalition’s pets.  Maybe some distance will free them from that yoke. (Though I might have misheard that.  It might be Phoenix Cartel that has some plans there.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big wheel of null sec keeps on turning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Imperium still has a lot of work ahead.  We got people over the new Imperium boarder, which extends now to \u003ca href=\"https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Paragon_Soul/G-M4GK\"\u003eG-M4GK\u003c/a\u003e in Paragon Soul and \u003ca href=\"https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Catch/4-07MU\"\u003e4-07MU\u003c/a\u003e in Catch, the near side of the two regional gates that connect to the space just abandoned.  But we still have to sort out who is moving where within the new space and get people moved.  Goonswarm itself has to pick up its stuff in UALX-3 Tenerifis and carry it to C-J6MT in Insmother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to figure out what I am going to do.  Do I yank up all my PI… my only source of income… yet again and move it to Insmother?  Also, with the move coming people dumped their saved PI materials on the market and the priced dropped quite a bit.  Do I just let my PI go fallow?  Things to think about as I look at what I have in UALX and wonder why I still have so much crap after having moved just last fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ll be at this all summer… and everybody won’t be settled even then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Saturday was a watershed, and a success beyond expectations.  Asher had a titan conga line setup in C-J6MT as a bit of a post operation celebration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_136107\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/im09_titanconga.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-136107\" data-attachment-id=\"136107\" data-permalink=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/06/23/delve-insmother-and-the-big-scoop/im09_titanconga/\" data-orig-file=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/im09_titanconga.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2381,1192\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026#34;aperture\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;credit\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;camera\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;caption\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;created_timestamp\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;copyright\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;focal_length\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;iso\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;shutter_speed\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;orientation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;}\" data-image-title=\"IM09_TitanConga\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When titans conga, they do so slowly\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/im09_titanconga.jpg?w=500\" data-large-file=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/im09_titanconga.jpg?w=600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/im09_titanconga.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/im09_titanconga.jpg?w=600 600w, https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/im09_titanconga.jpg?w=1198 1198w, https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/im09_titanconga.jpg?w=150 150w, https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/im09_titanconga.jpg?w=500 500w, https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/im09_titanconga.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-136107\"\u003eWhen titans conga, they do so slowly\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrave had \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1lha84s/so_long_delve_and_thanks_for_all_the_fish/\"\u003etheir own celebration as well\u003c/a\u003e, marking their somewhat brief tenure in Delve.  They remain the official victors of World War Bee however, being the only alliance to \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2024/10/26/brave-finally-takes-1dq1-a-wins-world-war-bee/\"\u003esuccessfully take 1DQ1-A from Goons\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I write this on Sunday morning, there are already pings.  Things need to be done.  Stuff still needs to be moved.  Somebody is touching our stuff and needs to be chased off.  The coalition remains busy.  There is always something to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
