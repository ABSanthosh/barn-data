The new playable character will be part of a side story that will be released alongside Warframe’s year-end update, The Old Peace.The new Frame was revealed at TennoCon, Digital Extremes’ annual Warframe fan event. He’s a hulking figure with flame-like highlights, as if his black armor were cracking to reveal hellfire beneath. Also, he’s got a long, pointy tail, and I’m sure everyone is going to be normal about it.Digital Extremes also revealed two new Protoframes that will appear with Uriel: Harrow and Wisp.Protoframes are, without getting too into spoilery lore stuff, more or less human versions of existing Warframes. They first appeared in the 1999 expansion in December 2024. Harrow’s Protoframe is Father Lyon Allard, and Wisp’s is Marie Leroux. They’re the first Protoframes to be introduced since the 1999 update – and boy, are they Catholic.Harrow is a priestlike Warframe who terrorizes the player in an early-game quest. He carries an incense burner called a thurible, and one of his abilities is to self-flagellate with it to increase his reload and fire rate. Father Lyon Allard form is equally goth, with midriff-baring leathery armor.Wisp, meanwhile, is an ethereal, floating enchantress. Unlike Harrow, this Warframe doesn’t have overt religious imagery. The design is based on the folklore of will-o’-wisps, fae lights that lure unwitting walkers to their death in bogs and swamps. But Marie Leroux is a beautiful nun-like figure with bright yellow eyes, who is definitely going to cause problems for the community. Together, the three characters make up something that creative director Rebecca Ford called “the Devil’s Triad.” She did not confirm why, where, or when their story will take place, only that it relates to the character of Albrecht Entrati “and some Orokin guilt he might have,” said Ford. Uriel is a sentimental character for the Warframe team. It is the last frame that late developer Mike Brennan worked on before he passed away in 2024.“There’s a lot of emotion tied into that frame,” said Ford. Digital Extremes will reveal more about the Devil’s Triad in its October devstream.",
