  "text": "\"We want to do more Atomfall\" Image credit: Rebellion I always find it a bit odd when people make comparisons like \"new game is the next game you really love\" because you're most likely setting yourself up for some kind of disappointment. Atomfall was the most recent game to fall victim to such a framing, with many dubbing it as British Fallout, which it didn't end up being, nor was it likely intended to be. Thus, alongside some other issues, it's had a general reception of \"yeah, it's not bad\", which in a world of sequels upon sequels isn't always the response a developer might want. Still, a sequel is still clearly on developer Rebellion's mind. Rebellion CEO Jason Kingsley recently spoke to GamesIndustry.biz about the open world game, and how he's feeling post launch. \"Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall,\" Kingsley explained, continuing on to say, \"Happily, that risk is paying off.\" Guess that roughly positive, slightly mixed response isn't a huge deal then! That doesn't mean Kingsley believes the scale of the developer's projects is perfect, in fact when asked about it whether or not they've got it just right, he said he doesn't think so. \"I think that one of the things Chris [Kingsley, Rebellion co-founder and CTO] and I want to do is repeat success. So we want to do more Sniper Elite, we want to do more Zombie Army, we want to do more Strange Brigade. Now it looks like we want to do more Atomfall - it's been successful, can we find the resources to do it? I don't know.\" Kingsley goes on to talk about things like those Fallout comparisons, success on Game Pass, releasing Sniper Elite: Resistance just a couple of months beforehand, all well worth reading, but no clear indication as to whether or not he thinks a sequel might come. Rebellion are obviously best known for their Sniper series these days, which continue to do well. Perhaps we'll have to wait a while longer to see if they can carve out a slice of that pie for another Atomfall.",
