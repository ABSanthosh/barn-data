Well, it's not ready just yet, but developer Deep Field Games did share a look at the game's upcoming Cold Fusion update that looks like it'll be a beefy one.

Well, it's not ready just yet, but developer Deep Field Games did share a look at the game's upcoming Cold Fusion update that looks like it'll be a beefy one. As you can probably guess by the title of the update, there's a bit of a chill coming, specifically in a new area called the Residence Sector. This new locale has \"something\" going on that's making it a bit too cold for anyone to hang out in, though the mystery behind it is something you'll likely have to play to discover. Then there's the new upgrade system that'll come with this update. Once you reach a certain tier you'll be able to build a new station that'll let you improve your weapons, armour, \"and a few other item types\", which sounds like it'll make certain instances in the game a little less stressful. It also seems like you'll be able to reset your character, and the room you do it in definitely doesn't look cold and unwelcoming. One big thing that will be changing is base assaults, because as Deep Field Games put it, they \"kinda stink.\" The Steam post detailing the update explains that while portal storms are generally working as intended, there are \"several cases, mostly non-Pest related assaults, where they will simply spawn inside your base or in the same spot over and over.\" As a result of this, some big changes have been made to how bases are detected, and Deep Field Games are hoping that assaults should feel \"a lot more unique and varied.\" On the smaller end of new additions in the update, and possibly my favourite of everything that's coming with it, is the fact that bins can be used as bins. Got something you don't want? Just chuck it in there! Gotta love it when a game has tiny little functions like this. There's no word on when this update will arrive just yet, so we'll all just have to keep our eyes peeled in the meantime.",
