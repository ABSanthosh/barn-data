  "text": "Blast Course is a puzzle platformer that will require you to carefully bounce yourself around with highly-explosive shots. If you are familiar with the game Team Fortress 2, you likely remember people using the larger gun-based weapons, firing them at the ground, allowing them to jump up higher. Blast Course takes this very fun concept and brings it to a new, almost Portal 2-feeling game. Blast Course is a first-person puzzle-platformer that takes you through a bunch of test chambers, testing out these new blast guns from The Interesting Company. A voice from above gives you bits of information and sometimes encourages you (although I felt a lot like the encouragements were more like taunts). The game does feel more puzzle than platformer with you needing to use your blasting gun to jump over gaps, climb on walls, and hit targets. You also need to move blocks around and sometimes shoot blocks to get them up to new heights. There are also different guns that you can unlock in Blast Course that work slightly differently for solving puzzles. One gun launches grenades that you can then get to explode at the same time. Perfect for triggering buttons! Blast Course feels nostalgic, but at the same time refreshing and new. There is something so fun about launching yourself around with explosives – something that feels so satisfying with each movement – which really draws people in. I quite like the comic book style of the game too, which lends well to this type of game. The puzzles feel clever and test your way of thinking while not being too challenging to make you feel hopeless. I got the chance to play Blast Course at BIG Conference where the developers spoke of their future with the game and how happy they were to create this while attending university together. It’s a very impressive student project! Blast Course is available now (for free) on Steam.
