The m16 R2 is Alienware's most popular gaming laptop, which isn't surprising considering its excellent build quality, top-of-the-line gaming prowess, and reasonable price point. The \"R2\" is the second generation model that was released in 2024; it's 14% lighter and more compact than its predecessor without compromising on performance.Alienware m16 R2 16\" Gaming LaptopAlienware m16 R2 16\" Intel Core Ultra 7 155H RTX 4060 Gaming LaptopAlienware m16 R2 16\" Intel Core Ultra 7 155H RTX 4070 Gaming LaptopThese two Alienware m16 R2 laptops feature a 16\" 2560x1600 QHD+ display, the new 14th gen Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor, your choice of GeForce RTX 4060 or RTX 4070 GPU, 16GB of DDR5-5600MHz RAM, and a 1TB NVMe SSD. The Intel Core Ultra 7 155H is a Meteor Lake CPU with a Turbo Boost clock speed of 4.8GHz with 16 cores, 22 threads, and a 24MB cache. The Core Ultra 7 is the successor to the Intel Core i7 CPU; it offers similar performance while consuming less power, and thus reducing heat and increasing battery life. If you intend to use this laptop as a gaming rig, there's very little reason to upgrade to the Core Ultra 9 because the vast majority of games doesn't benefit from the additional cores.You absolutely will, however, need a decent amount of GPU power to be able to run games smoothly on the display's bumped-up 2560x1600 resolution. The RTX 4060 GPU with 115W TGP (140W with dynamic boost) would definitely be the bare minimum we'd recommend; its performance lies somewhere between the RTX 3070 and the RTX 3070 Ti, so it's no slouch in terms of gaming performance. The more powerful RTX 4070 with 115W TGP (140W with dynamic boost) is comparable to the RTX 3080 and would fare better at 1440p. Both RTX 40 series GPUs also support DLSS 3.0.Looking for more deals?
