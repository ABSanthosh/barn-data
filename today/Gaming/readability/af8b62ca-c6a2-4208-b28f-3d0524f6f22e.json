At Annapurna Interactive, we’re fortunate to work with some of the world’s best development teams around the world, supporting them to help bring unique game experiences to PlayStation. Today, we premiere a new Annapurna Showcase, highlighting some of these teams, sharing exciting news and updates about previously announced games that are coming very soon. Sayonara Wild Hearts The critically-acclaimed rhythm game Sayonara Wild Hearts is coming to PlayStation 5 today. Experience a brand-new PS5 exclusive Remix Arcade game mode chasing high scores in endlessly replayable levels set to a selection of songs from the game’s iconic soundtrack. Sayonara Wild Hearts also features upgraded 4K visuals, runs at up to 120 FPS, and supports haptic feedback on PS5. Those who own the game on PlayStation 4 can upgrade their copy to the PlayStation 5 version for free as long as both platforms are linked to the same account. Lushfoil Photography Sim Explore diverse landscapes, play with camera settings, and capture the perfect shot in Lushfoil Photography Sim. Featuring breathtaking locations, from the picturesque Italian countryside to the saltwater beaches of West Australia, Lushfoil Photography Sim delivers the premier digital photography experience, ramping up your favorite in-game photo modes to 11. We’re excited for PlayStation players to experience the delight of travel photography when the game launches April 15, 2025 on PlayStation 5. To a T Led by esteemed Katamari Damancy creator Keita Takahashi, to a T is a charming, colorful adventure game about a teen navigating life in a small town with their cute dog companion. Play as a teenager (Teen), with a unique posture just trying to live a normal life in a small coastal town. Explore the town along with the help of Teen’s loyal dog and loving mother. While going to school and contending with bullies, Teen discovers a new ability granted to them by their extraordinary posture, as they start to uncover more about their mysterious lineage. PlayStation players can be charmed and delighted on May 28 when To a T launches on PlayStation 5. The latest trailer for the game features an original track, “The Giraffe Song,” performed by Rebecca Sugar (Steven Universe, Adventure Time). Wheel World Wheel World is a single-player bicycle racing adventure where you’re tasked with preventing the world from collapsing. You are Kat, a young cyclist with one mission: save Wheel World from total collapse. Explore a stunning world filled with impressive vistas, hidden secrets, and races that will test your skills. Customize your bike with an endless array of parts, from sleek speedsters to off-road beasts—there’s no limit to how you can ride. Customize your ride, explore, and compete in this cycling journey  with original music from the electronic music label Italians Do It Better when it launches this summer on PlayStation 5. That’s all for the Annapurna Interactive Showcase 2025. We hope you are just as excited about the upcoming releases as we are. We can’t wait to get these games in your hands but for now make sure to follow and wishlist the games on the PlayStation Store to be among the first to receive the latest updates. From all of us at Annapurna, as well as our developer partners – thank you so much for joining us. Trending Stories",
