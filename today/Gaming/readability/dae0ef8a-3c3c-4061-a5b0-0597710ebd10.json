The balm for me is that I'm spending Saturday feeding squirrels at one of my favourite Glasgow parks, and then visiting a cat cafe. It's a good time to be me. I hope you've all got a healthy dose of animal in your lives to help get you through these chilly March mornings. Games, too. Lots of games. Here's what we're clicking on this weekend! BrendyPerhaps inspired by my recent time with Car Mechanic Simulator 2021, I have bought a used Toyota Corolla. I will spend some of my weekend kicking tires, both real and simulated. EdwinThis weekend I'm going to be reading a book about pork production, playing the demo for chasm-climbing horror game White Knuckle, and experimenting with some new recipes. I've recently learned about prebanac, a caramelised butter bean dish which I hear is a staple in Serbia, Bosnia and Macedonia. I like butter beans and this looks tremendous. I hope I can do it justice. PS. It's International Women's Day on Saturday 8th March. GrahamA pal and I who played through It Takes Two together last year are now going to begin Split Fiction. I'm looking forward to discovering which parts of the writing are most grating. JamesI'm testing the MSI Claw 8 AI+ this weekend, so once I'm finished choking with rage over how much the second half of that name spoils the first, I will be playing as many handheld-friendly games as possible in a 48-hour period. JeremyProbably more Monster Hunter Wilds for me this weekend, unless we happen to get code for a certain other game that's going to be a big release and requires guides team attention. Or, I might forsake modern games entirely and go back to the comfort food of playing something from 2000 (AKA Vagrant Story) for a while. My wife and I have been house hunting for the past month and the whole experience drives my stress levels to extreme heights and makes me want to hide from the world, so perhaps that's the right thing to do. NicI'm finishing off the Suikoden Remasters for review. Every time I go to the well, Gengen the Kobold is there telling me how good the water tastes after a hard day's work. But you don't do any work, Gengen, because you're always drinking from that sodding well. If he's still there next time I'm going to boot him in. OllieIn an effort to switch off my brain in the evenings, I've started a new game of Shapez 2. Okay, that's a lie, it's a factory game and so requires quite a bit of brain-computation, but it's relaxing all the same. I've also been feeling the itch to return to Against The Storm recently, which I think has a similar sort of balance between strategy and tranquility. But you, reader dear, what are you playing this weekend?...",
