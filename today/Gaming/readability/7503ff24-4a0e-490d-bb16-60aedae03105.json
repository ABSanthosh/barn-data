  "text": "In Ororto you are traveling around a world inspired by the Colombian Muisca civilization – a colorful place of open paths, enemies, puzzles. Isometric metroidvanias/exploration-focused action games are rarely my thing. I myself getting lost and not knowing exactly what I am meant to do next. However, when I sat down to play Ororto at Indie Dev Day, I was drawn in by the unique main character and how smooth everything looked. In Ororto, you are traveling around a world inspired by the Muisca civilization (the Muisca are an indigenous people and culture from Colombia). Here, there are open paths, enemies, and lots of little puzzles scattered across the world. You will find yourself slashing or shooting through enemies who disappear in a satisfying puff of black liquid that stains the ground. There are pots to break, gold to find, and strange invaders to destroy. Some areas act as boss fights, locking you in and forcing you to take on appearing enemies until they die. This feels intense and challenging as you try to shoot and hack your way out of these dangerous situations. Other areas have you moving around paths, so you could avoid your enemies, but it’s much more fun to destroy them. Recharging your gun is done by breaking pots, so you do need to be careful when it comes to your ammo, which feels balanced with the environment. In places where you really need your gun, the items you need to destroy will respawn, which gives you a fighting chance to play. Often, you can see areas that you cannot access in Ororto. In the demo that I played, you didn’t need to find some mysterious object to continue. Instead, you needed to find a way to use your gun to trigger a way to get to the new area or a way to unlock a path. It feels quite fun to figure out these things! Ororto is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can sign up to the developer’s mailing list.
