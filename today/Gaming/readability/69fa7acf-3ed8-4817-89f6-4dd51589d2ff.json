Genre:Adventure, Role Playing Compatibility:HD Universal Staff Member Patreon Silver Anyone know if this is has full controller support? Would love to play this on my iPad. I’ve played a bit of 2 on the box and it was good. I wonder what the main differences are. Staff Member Patreon Silver Backbone support is spotty and weird. Can’t speak to other Bluetooth controllers. Thanks for your response! I have an Xbox controller and a Nimbus controller. Does anyone know if either of these work? Thanks in advance! Nimbus doesn't work right either. You can move, but not jump. Gonna say that it's not controller playable at the moment. Also, UI on the iPad Pro 12.9 is misaligned and off. Released before proper QA, it looks like. Typical Square Enix launch these days. :/ I've already bought this one on Vita and PS4 so I'll probably skip mobile this time around. I never finished DQB2 though, it'll be interesting to see if that hits the app store. I do wish 2 things for SQUEENIX releases: controller support, cloud support. Especially for the prices of their ports. Totally agree. The games have controller support on other platforms. Doesn’t make any sense to remove it for mobile. Staff Member Patreon Silver You can actually jump, but it’s mapped to the of the “menu” button! Nothing else works. Screen controls are good on my iPhone 13 Pro, BTW, and the game runs at what seems like a steady 60 FPS on high settings. I played only the demo on the Switch, but I seem to remember performance not being great. Thinking about buying this. Has anyone played with touch controls, and if so, how are they (on iPhone, not iPad, to be clear)? I tried to DQB2 on XGPU, but not enough to get into it properly. Having it on mobile could be what I need to get sucked in, and maybe even convince me to give the sequel its much deserved second go. Staff Member Patreon Silver As I mentioned above, touch controls are good, at least from the little I’ve been able to play today. Anyone who played it can say what the battery consumption is like? In my opinion, it is still not well-optimized at the moment. I tried it on both iPhone 8 \u0026 the iPad Pro M1, and both get uncomfortably warm within minutes. Also the screen is stuttering on iPad Pro. My guess: It is not optimized for high refresh rate displays at the moment. Thank you! I imagined it would not be. I am on the fence on whether to buy it for mobile of ps4 for that reason. Really enjoying this so far. Played it on PS4 a few years ago and regretted not getting it on the vita at the time as always thought it would have been a better handheld game, so really glad this shadow dropped. Funny because I was thinking there hasn't been many great games (for me) in a long time being released and then this, Dysmantle, Gunfire Reborn and Turnip Boy are all released together...not enough time in the day for all these Almost the same here. Played it on PS4. Was fun but haven’t sink in enough though always wanted to. I too feel it would be better on my iPad. So I bought it too and so far it’s great. They did put in some effort on the touch control thou. Which is a nice touch. But too many games lately to play for me too. Not enough time Is this really under a gig in size? i believe so. At least on my iPad is show 655MB Share This Page",
