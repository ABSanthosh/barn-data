  "text": "Woodo sees you poking around wooden dioramas of calming places as you try to figure out where to place a handful of items. Woodo is one of those puzzle games that captivates you from the visuals, hooking you in on its unique look. The game is like a world made of wood and clay, and the lighting and general vibe just feel so cozy. Each of the different levels have their own diorama-inspired area, giving you a small capsule of an area to look at without it feeling overwhelming or too large to solve. In Woodo, you have a small inventory on the side of the screen filled with different items or parts of items that you can scroll through. You can then zoom into the world or pan around to see what is missing from the picture and where these items fit in. In the scene, there are white versions of missing items, giving you guidance on where to place things from your inventory. You do need to play around with the scene, opening drawers and cabinets, so that you can ensure everything is inside of it. This gives the game some nice exploration as well. In my time with the demo at Gamescom, I didn’t get into much of the story but the developer explained it would be about a character called Foxy who is staying in the countryside for the summer instead of in the city they always lived in. Here, they find calmer and simpler way of life filled with feelings that remind the character of their childhood. Woodo is a relaxing game with that doesn’t try to rush you with a time limit. There is something just so joyful and beautiful about slowly adding to this world and finishing the little dioramas. If you are looking for something relaxing and fun to just put together, this is looking to be a fantastic game to pick up and play. Woodo is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
