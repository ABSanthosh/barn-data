It's just another federal holiday that happens to be right in the middle of February. Nevertheless, retailers are starting to drop prices on plenty of items ahead of the weekend. The Amazon Presidents' Day sale may not be as big as Black Friday or Prime Day, but if you're looking to do some online shopping right now, we're seeing some of the best prices of the year so far.If you want to take a look at the full sale, Amazon has an official Presidents' Day landing page with all of its discounts. To help you find the very best savings within this, however, I've sorted out the popular products that are actually good deals. Each discount featured below is either the lowest price, or matches the lowest price it has been all year.The Best Amazon Presidents' Day Deals TodayA good portion of the best deals in this Amazon sale are on Amazon devices. The deal on the Kindle Paperwhite is the first discount we've seen since Black Friday, which especially notable since Kindle deals in general are few and far between. The Apple Watch SE discount we covered last week as part of the Valentine's Day sale is still noteworthy at its current price. There's also a pretty good sale on sleeping Pokémon plushies that brings these adorable toys down to their lowest price of the year so far.There are generally a lot of discounts that Amazon has brought onto its sale page that we've either seen before in 2025 or were much lower during sales events last year. If you're looking to save as much money as possible, it's probably worth waiting for better price cuts on any bigger purchases.Should You Shop the Amazon Presidents' Day Sales or Wait?One of the advantages Presidents' Day sales have are the time of year they take place. If you look at our calendar of upcoming sales events, there aren't really any big shopping holidays again until Memorial Day weekend at the end of May. So while a lot of these discounts will likely be better during main events like Prime Day and Black Friday, if you're looking to buy something right now, this sale is likely your best bet.That being said, you can still be smart about your purchases. If you don't need a Kindle or a TV right this moment, it's still worth waiting until later in the year. You can also check historical pricing on CamelCamelCamel to make sure any of the deals listed are actually worth it. This is a helpful trick we consistently use to ensure we're recommending things at the right price point.More Presidents' Day sales live nowOriginally posted: Feb 11, 2025 11:25 pm",
