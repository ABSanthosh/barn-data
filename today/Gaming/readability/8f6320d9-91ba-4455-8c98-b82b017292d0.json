  "description": "Star Wars video games have primarily focused on action for several years now, but Star Wars: Zero Company breaks from that trend by throwing players into the battlefields of a single-player tactics game. The genre remains fairly popular thanks to games like XCOM, Gears Tactics, and Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters, but there's still a perceived barrier to entry in a genre that doesn't hesitate to throw a lot of gameplay mechanics at its audience.Developer Bit Reactor is looking to avoid this issue with Zero Company, as the studio is aiming to create a Star Wars adventure that is both approachable and appealing to hardcore fans of the genre. Speaking to GameSpot, Bit Reactor creative director Greg Foertsch explained how Zero Company will organically teach players its systems as they delve deeper into the murky underbelly of the Clone Wars.\"I think that when you look at these games--in general--a lot of times the mechanics can overwhelm and you tack the story on later. By using the story to guide us, it doesn't shut down doors, it open doors. \"And it's not just about what we want people to play, but also what we want them to feel. And so through camera work, presentation, and story, I think we're able to hit a lot of notes and really make this game appeal in a different way and kind of innovate in a way that the other games in the space haven't.

And those are going to meaningfully affect both the tactical layer of gameplay and the experience that you have back at the Den.\"Star Wars: Zero Company will launch in 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.
