  "description": "Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 takes you on a grand adventure across the regions of Bohemia. However, there's one individual who's been to more exotic and far-flung locales. Now, he needs your expertise after he's been accused of a crime that he did not commit. Here's our The Lion's Den guide to help you save Musa in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. Likewise, please be reminded that this article contains spoilers.How to save Musa in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - The Lion's Den quest guideThe Lion's Den is a main quest that happens during the game's second act, which takes place in the Kuttenberg region. There are several objectives that you need to tackle here, including a murder investigation and subsequent trial, as well as an optional mission that furthers your romantic involvement with another character. At a certain point, you're also given a deadline to finish all your tasks. Part 1A: How to enter Sigismund's CampThe Lion's Den quest in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 occurs after the events of Exodus. The initial step involves talking to Jan Zizka at the inn, where he tells you that you need to infiltrate Sigismund's Camp. We recommend completing The Devil's Pack before getting to this point, since the mercenary band members that you've recruited will join the meeting, too.In any case, head to Sigismund's Camp, which is due northeast of Suchdol. Likewise, be sure to tag the fast travel point in the burned out village of Opatowitz to the north.Then, at the camp entrance, bribe the guard with 500 Groschen so you can pass. Turn left from the entrance to reach the baths and have a chat with Katherine. Part 1B: The Stalker side quest and Katherine romanceKatherine will tell you about your next move, but she wants you to wait until it's nighttime. Skip the time and talk to her to watch a cutscene, where you can also choose flirtatious responses. She then admits that a creep is watching her, which starts The Stalker side quest:You must complete The Stalker side quest before finishing The Lion's Den. Also, the creep who's been watching Katherine must not notice you.There are a few ways to handle this ornery fellah. In our playthrough, we simply commanded our dog companion Mutt to sniff Katherine's shoe. Mutt then tracked the scent, which led us to the tent of a soldier named Chakan.You can either pass dialogue skill checks (i.e. Persuasion or Presence), offer a bribe, or beat this dork to a pulp.When you're done, return to Katherine and tell her that the creep won't be bothering her anymore. Your help here nets a huge reputation boost, which is great if you want to romance Katherine later in the campaign. Part 2A: Meeting Musa and healing MyshekThe main objective here is to talk to Stephen Crow so you can join Sigismund's army. You're then introduced to the commander, Ditrich Katz. Katz wants you to find a lost charter that's supposed to be delivered by his soldiers, one of whom is actually being tended to by a foreign physician.So, who exactly is this Musa that you need to save in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2? Well, he's none other than an accomplished healer and scholar who's been everywhere in the known world, from the Iberia to the Holy Land and every place in between. Due to circumstances, Musa now serves King Sigismund. Meanwhile, the soldier that he's treating, Myshek, seems to be worse for wear.This is an optional task, but you can diagnose Myshek to learn about his condition. You then need to give him 1x Strong Cockerel. You can't find any of these bottles nearby, so you have to brew one on your own. We discuss the basic steps in our Alchemy guide, but here's the gist:Base: SpiritsGrind 2x Mint using the mortar and pestle, then put it in the cauldron.Boil for one turn.Add 1x Valerian.Boil for two turns.Hold the phial and interact with the still.Note: Completing the brewing process perfectly while using dried herbs isn't enough. You need to use fresh Mint and Valerian herbs if you want a better chance at getting Strong Cockerel. Part 2B: The lost charterIf you're able to give Strong Cockerel to Myshek, you'll rouse him from his coma and he'll tell you the exact location of his squad. If you give him regular or weak Cockerel, he'll die and you won't be able to hear more information from him.Either way, you have to travel to the mill in Old Lhota, which actually has its own fast travel point. It's just northwest of Maleshov, which you visited as part of Taking French Leave.Once there, a soldier will approach you. You can pass a skill check: Persuasion - \"Myshek told me about it (Lie).\" This lets you investigate the mill without worries. Alternatively, you can take out all of them.Regardless of your decision, enter the main building and climb up the ladder. The chest here contains the Lost Charter for King Sigismund quest item. Part 3A: The murder investigationReturn to Sigismund's Camp to continue the Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 The Lion's Den quest. The moment you talk to Katz, a cutscene will trigger, and that's followed by news that a veteran warrior named Chertan has been killed.Follow the trail of blood that leads you to a trough that you can investigate. Then, enter the medical tent to see the commotion. It looks like Musa has been accused of murdering Chertan.Note: At this point, you only have two in-game days to investigate all the clues and complete Musa's trial. After two days have passed, one of Sigismund's lawmen will arrive and the trial will proceed regardless of how you progressed. Part 3B: Musa under guardThe first order of business is to talk to Musa, who's being kept under watch in a tent next to the Alchemy bench. The guard here patrols the area back and forth. If he sees you, you can select certain replies:Domination: \"Katz sent me.\"Scholarship: I'm Musa's assistant.\"Drinking: \"Do you want to go for an ale?\"Domination: \"Get away from here, it's not safe!\"If you fail any of these skill checks, the guard will get annoyed. As such, it's better to wait for him to turn around, then stealthily crouch-walk toward Musa. He then tells you to investigate the corpse and acquire his Book of Poison. Part 3C: The Book of Poison - How to determine which poison was usedIf you want to save Musa in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, then it's important that you learn about the concoction that killed the victim. Examine the victim's body for any telltale signs. Then, open the nearby chest and grab The Book of Poison. Read it to find out about the different kinds of brews, as well as the symptoms and ingredients.BaneSymptoms: Black eyes, dry body, and loose muscles.Ingredients: Wine, Wormwood, Belladonna, and Fly Agaric.Pitohui Bird PoisonSymptoms: Tingling and tension in muscles; stiff body.Ingredients: Pitohui Bird Feather.Dollmaker PotionSymptoms: Numbness in body (especially the genitals), clogged intestines, and temporary blindness.Ingredients: Any strong liquor, Valerian, and Herb Paris. The decoction must be kept in cold temperatures.Kiss of DeathSymptoms: Stomachache, red and blistered skin, emptying of bowels, and broken nails.Ingredients: Arsenic, Oak Bark, Rose Water, and Red Copper; all boiled in a clay pot and tested on an iron nail.LullabySymptoms: Faintness and slurred speech; drowsiness and deep sleep.Ingredients: Oil, Thistle, Herb Paris, and Poppies. Part 3D: Finding the real culpritThe next part is very important, since you have to investigate the tents of your primary suspects: Lord Grozav, Stephen Crow, the two guards that discovered Chertan, and even Musa himself. Look for clues on their beds, chests, and other fixtures. One thing of note is that you can also sneak and steal from these NPCs. For instance, you can pickpocket a Strange Letter from Stephen Crow--it's a coded message that's tells of a devious scheme.As of the time of this writing, we're unable to confirm if the type of poison and the available evidence tend to differ among players. In our playthrough, we discovered the following:Chertan had reddish skin, broken nails, and empty bowels.Crow's tent contained Oak Bark, Rose Water, an iron nail for testing, and the aforementioned Strange Letter.There were several items in the other tents, but they were mostly inconsequential.Upon finding the necessary evidence, Henry remarked that Chertan was killed by the Kiss of Death poison, though he still expressed doubts. Part 4A: How to defend Musa at the trialYou can then talk to Katz to relay your findings. This leads to the Musa trial in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. Here are a few tips from our campaign:If you keep responding out of turn or make accusations without any evidence, the lawman will grow tired of you. After three mistakes, Henry will be executed instead.When we handed Crow's Strange Letter, it was enough to paint him as the culprit.We also reloaded our save to present more evidence--i.e. \"You brewed a poison called Kiss of Death.\"It was also possible to accuse Grozav instead.Regardless of your choices, the person you accuse, assuming you have enough evidence, will be found guilty. They'll attempt to run away, but they'll get cut down for their troubles.Musa is safe, and he'll be glad for your help. He also becomes a master-level trainer who can teach you Alchemy, Scholarship, and Survival, each costing a whopping 5,000 Groschen. Part 4B: The ambushAfter Musa's trial is over, talk to Katherine to tell her that your group should proceed according to plan. Speak with Katz to trigger a cutscene where Sigismund's forces are ambushed. Eliminate the remaining hostiles and decide what to do with Katz. (We decided to spare him in our playthrough.)That does it for our guide on how to save Musa in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. We hope our tips help you make the right choices during The Lion's Den quest.If you need more tips as you explore Bohemia in the Middle Ages, be sure to visit our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 guides hub.",

Well, he\u0026#39;s none other than an accomplished healer and scholar who\u0026#39;s been everywhere in the known world, from the Iberia to the Holy Land and every place in between. Due to circumstances, Musa now serves King Sigismund.
