Image credit: Sandfall Interactive Steam’s Summer Sale is legendary, but it doesn’t always mean you’re getting the lowest price. As much as we all love watching our wishlist light up with discounts, some of the best deals are actually happening off-site. Fanatical and Green Man Gaming have been busy undercutting Valve’s storefront with bigger savings on the exact same Steam keys. We’re talking about serious hits here. AAA blockbusters, cult classics, and recent releases are all fair game. From Elden Ring to Ghost of Tsushima, these trusted retailers are slashing prices harder than Malenia in phase two. So if you want the best bang for your buck during the Summer Sale, look beyond the big banner on Steam’s homepage.Here's some of my favorite discounts: I grabbed Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from Fanatical for $39.49 instead of $44.99 on Steam. Same exact game, just with more left in my wallet. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (Deluxe) Steam Summer Sale: $53.99 Fanatical: $47.39 See here After the Deluxe version of Clair Obscur instead? You'll save a few bucks going with Fanatical. $47.39 beats Steam’s $53.99 price tag any day. Death Stranding: Director's Cut Steam Summer Sale: $15.99 Fanatical: $12.79 See here Death Stranding’s a deal at $15.99 on Steam, but Fanatical makes it even sweeter at $12.79. I’ll take the extra coffee money, thanks. Green Man Gaming dropped Dragon’s Dogma 2 to $24.99 while Steam’s holding firm at $29.39. Easy choice. If you're eyeing the Deluxe edition, you might as well save a fiver and get it from Green Man Gaming. It’s the same edition, just with a smarter price tag. I held off on Elden Ring for ages, but this Fanatical price finally nudged me. $32.99 is hard to beat, and it’s a Steam key all the same. You can pick up Football Manager 2024 even cheaper at Fanatical. $13.49 compared to $14.99 might not sound huge, but every little helps when your Steam wishlist is a mile long. Fanatical’s undercutting Steam again. Ghost of Tsushima for $35.99 is just better than $40.19, plain and simple. Snagged Hogwarts Legacy for $12.75 at Green Man Gaming. Steam wants $14.99 for the same magic. No thanks. It’s only 30 cents cheaper on Fanatical, but hey, that’s still cheaper. Red Dead 2 is worth every penny either way. Going all in with the Ultimate Edition? Fanatical still wins. It’s the better deal, even by a little. Skyrim for under nine bucks? Green Man Gaming nailed it. This beats the Steam price and then some. I couldn’t justify paying $39.99 when Green Man Gaming had Oblivion for $33.99. Cheaper is better. If you’re eyeing the Deluxe edition, Green Man Gaming’s $40.79 is a way better deal than Steam’s $47.99.",
