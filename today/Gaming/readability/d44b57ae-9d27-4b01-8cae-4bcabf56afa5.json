Save up to $169 off Secretlab's popular Titan line of gaming chairs, Magnus gaming desks (including its Magnus Pro electric standing desk model), and accessories like the Secretlab Skins upholstery covers, desk mats, cable management, and more. Sadly, the newer releases like the Titan Evo Nanogen Edition chair and the recliner add-on are exempt from this sale. If you're looking to upgrade your chair, there's no better time than Black Friday. Secretlab sale events only come around a handful of times per year, and the Black Friday sale is usually the best one of them all.It's no secret that we love our Secretlab gaming chairs. Two of the six chairs in our best gaming chair roundup are Secretlab models. Of all the gaming chairs we covered in our \"Budget to Best\" roundup video earlier this year, my colleague Akeem Lawanson considered the Secretlab Titan Evo to be the most comfortable. No good chair comes cheap and Secretlab chairs definitely cost a premium, but we think the craftsmanship, materials, and customizability are worth it.Featured in this articleYou can quickly browse through all of the listed products on sale above. For more information on each product and why they are worth your consideration, read through below.Secretlab Titan EvoSecretlab Titan EvoThe Titan Evo starts at $519 during the sale. This is Secretlab's flagship chair and it's available in small, medium, and large sizes. Upholstery options include Neo Hybrid leatherette, SoftWeave Plus fabric, or premium Napa leather. The chair features cold-cure foam upholstery for the seat, a supportive four-way lumbar system, full length backrest with 165 degrees of recline, full metal 4D armrests with magnetically attached PU cushions, and a memory foam headrest pillow.Aside from the build quality, the Titan Evo also stands out thanks to the sheer number of officially licensed designs from popular video games, TV shows, and more. Some of the more popular examples include The Witcher, Overwatch, Attack on Titan, League of Legends, World of Warcraft, and Game of Thrones. They generally cost more than the standard colors, but they're worth it if you're looking for that extra personal touch.In our Secretlab Titan Evo review, Chris Coke wrote that \"after two years of daily use, the Secretlab Titan Evo has proven that it can stand the test of time and still be one of the best gaming chairs you can buy. Meaningful ergonomics paired with Secretlab’s wide selection of designs, it remains a fantastic option, especially for fans of bright colors or designs.\"Secretlab Titan 2020Secretlab Titan 2020The prior model Titan 2020 gaming chair is available for $474, which is $45 less than the base model Titan Evo. The Titan 2020 is still an excellent chair and not much different than the current Evo model. In fact, outside of an upholstery change (the PU leather has been updated with Neo Hybrid Leatherette), the changes are mostly cosmetic. You are limited to fewer design options, so if you want to build out something that's truly unique, you might want to splurge a bit extra for the current generation Titan Evo model.Secretlab Titan Evo LiteSecretlab Titan Evo LiteAmong the Titan chairs, the Evo Lite is definitely the best value with its starting price tag of $419, or a full $100 less than the base model Titan Evo. It's built upon the same frame as the Titan Evo and has the same core features like the cold-cure foam cushioning, lumbar, 165 degrees of recline, and 4D armrests. What it compromises on is customization, with \"only\" two upholstery options, two sizes, and five colors, a non-adjustable lumbar system, simpler arm rests, and no included head rest. If none of these tradeoffs bother you, then you'll be saving quite a bit of money.Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen EditionPreorder (Out November 24)Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen EditionAlthough the Titan Evo Nanogen Edition isn't on sale, it deserves mention simply because this is our top pick for the best gaming chair. In our Titan Evo Nanogen Edition review, Chris Coke wrote that \"the Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen Edition deserves every bit of the overwhelming praise I’ve given. Granted, at $799 it’s significantly more expensive than the original and not far off from an entry-level Herman-Miller. But the return it offers in comfortable, supportive gaming is well worth the extra cost thanks to dramatically improved materials in both the fabric and multi-layered padding. The Titan Evo Nanogen Edition is class-leading, and is hands-down the most comfortable gaming chair I’ve ever used.\"Secretlab Titan Recliner Add-OnNot Yet Available (Out 2025)Secretlab Titan Recliner Add-OnSecretlab also announced a new recliner add-on to anyone who already owns the Titan Evo chair. It's so new that not only will this recliner ship out sometime next year, it's not even available for preorder yet. We have received a unit for testing, however, and it has turned out to be a very practical addition. In our recliner add-on review, Chris Coke wrote that \"while both comfort and value are subjective things, the recliner is able to take the Titan Evo and transform it from one of the best racing style gaming chairs to standing head and shoulders above the competition at its price point. It’s novel enough that I wouldn’t be surprised to see other brands following suit in the near future. If you don’t mind paying for it, it’s an absolutely killer upgrade for your gaming chair.\"Secretlab Magnus and Magnus ProSecretlab MagnusSecretlab Magnus ProThe Magnus and Magnus Pro are also on sale during Black Friday. The Magnus is a traditional fixed-frame gaming desk while the Magnus Pro ups the ante with a custom designed electric standing desk frame for an additional $250. Both desks feature an all-metal desktop surface, solid steel legs and cleverly thought out areas for cable management, but the Magnus Pro has some really unique features including a power cable that runs internally inside one of the telescoping legs and an in-line control panel that you won't bump into.In our Secretlab Magnus Pro review. Mark Knapp writes that \"the Secretlab Magnus Pro is a fantastic desk, bringing the brilliant cable management solutions of the original Magnus to a fast, quiet, and wide-ranging motorized standing desk. The desk is built well and proves an excellent platform for work and play alike. It’s an expensive desk though, and for the money, it would have been nice to see a smarter safety mechanism for the motors and the desk mat included. Still, the overall quality you get is a big step up from cheaper standing desks, and the optional accessories truly enhance the experience. Anyone who’s not committed to a standing desk should save their money and go for the standard Magnus if everything else about this model sounds good, but for gamers who love a tidy desk and want the flexibility of a standing desk, the Magnus Pro should be the first they consider.\"Should I Wait Until Black Friday?Probably not in this case. This is Secretlab's official Black Friday Sale and it will run through Black Friday. We expect the sale to continue a bit longer through Cyber Monday as well. There's a chance a specific chair configuration might go on sale at a third-party retailer like Amazon, but most of the deals should remain largely the same.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

The Magnus is a traditional fixed-frame gaming desk while the Magnus Pro ups the ante with a custom designed electric standing desk frame for an additional $250. Both desks feature an all-metal desktop surface, solid steel legs and cleverly thought out areas for cable management, but the Magnus Pro has some really unique features including a power cable that runs internally inside one of the telescoping legs and an in-line control panel that you won\u0026#39;t bump into.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eIn our \u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/secretlab-magnus-pro-standing-desk-review\"\u003eSecretlab Magnus Pro\u003c/a\u003e review. Mark Knapp writes that \u0026#34;the Secretlab Magnus Pro is a fantastic desk, bringing the brilliant cable management solutions of the original Magnus to a fast, quiet, and wide-ranging motorized standing desk. The desk is built well and proves an excellent platform for work and play alike. It’s an expensive desk though, and for the money, it would have been nice to see a smarter safety mechanism for the motors and the desk mat included. Still, the overall quality you get is a big step up from cheaper standing desks, and the optional accessories truly enhance the experience. Anyone who’s not committed to a standing desk should save their money and go for the standard Magnus if everything else about this model sounds good, but for gamers who love a tidy desk and want the flexibility of a standing desk, the Magnus Pro should be the first they consider.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-cy=\"title2\"\u003eShould I Wait Until Black Friday?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eProbably not in this case.
