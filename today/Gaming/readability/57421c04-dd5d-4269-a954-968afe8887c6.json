  "description": "After months of speculation, A24 has reportedly confirmed that a live-action Elden Ring movie is in the works. The project is said to be helmed by Alex Garland (Ex Machina, Annihilation, Civil War), who is set to both write and direct the upcoming film.Though several outlets have speculated on the film's existence the past few months, Deadline reported it officially confirmed earlier today. In addition to Garland, a few other names have been attached to the film. Most notably is George R. R. Martin, who famously collaborated with Elden Ring studio From Software to help write the game's backstory. Meanwhile, Peter Rice, and DNA's Andrew MacDonald and Allon Reich, are all set to produce.The news comes shortly after the release of Garland's latest film, Warfare, which was also made in partnership with A24 and has currently grossed over $32 million since releasing last month. It also comes just ahead of the release of Elden Ring: Nightreign, an Elden Ring spin-off game that focuses on cooperative, PvE gameplay and it set to release on May 30.",
