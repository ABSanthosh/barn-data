  "text": "Catto’s Post Office is an adorable, cozy mail delivery game where you live in a town of cats who all need their mail delivered…eventually. Sometimes, you just need to become a cat that’s delivering mail to other animals around the town. However, that job comes with some challenges. It’s pretty easy to get distracted when there are cat toys at every corner (and even some boxes that you can spend time sitting in) when you have a job to do. When you can stop being distracted, you can go to the post office to get a package to deliver, then find the kitty that needs their mail. Often, the other cats in Catto’s Post Office need help – from missing items to needing to talk to another cat, they are looking for your assistance. You can stick to your job and be helpful or you can just explore and play. These tasks are often not complex, with items nearby that you can see and find. It’s quite funny to think about how a cat even uses these items – they don’t even have thumbs to use scissors. This game is designed to be a bite-sized experience, allowing people to play through the entire game in one sitting. These sort of cozy, simplistic games with no complex puzzles or goals are so ideal for a rainy afternoon or just when you want to unwind. I got the chance to play a short demo of Catto’s Post Office at Gamescom this year. The colorful city drew me in, and the fact that I was a cat that could sit in a box is what kept me exploring. It’s adorable, fun, and could be played by all ages. Although the concept is a simple one, it’s well worth checking out if you like cats. And mail. And sometimes not delivering that mail because you’re being a silly cat. Catto’s Post Office is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
