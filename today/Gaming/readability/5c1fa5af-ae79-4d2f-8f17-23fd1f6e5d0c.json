Fantasy Critic League â€“ Like Fantasy Football, but for Video Games We went into the week with the following standings: TAGN Fantasy Critic League Week 1 Standings So we have to go down the list to see what changed. Thursday at 17:00 Pacific open bidding for the week wrapped up and the titles in play were announced as follows: F1 2025 Release Date: Mid 2025 Hype Factor: 1.6 Sniper Elite: Resistance Release Date: 2025-01-30 Hype Factor: 8.3 The Blood of Dawnwalker Release Date: TBA Hype Factor: 0.1 The Outer Worlds 2 (ðŸŽ¯ Counter Pick Bid) Release Date: 2025 Hype Factor: 65 Wonder Woman Release Date: TBA Hype Factor: 0.1 WWE 2K25 Release Date: 2025 Hype Factor: 2.7 Then there was the wait until Saturday to see who would collect which titles. However, we did not get the results of bids last night at the expected time, 17:00 Pacific/20:00 Eastern.Â  Checking in on the Fantasy Critic Discord server, it turned out there was an error and the process did not run automatically.Â  The person who runs the app was out at a play on Saturday night and only found out about the problem because he got a message from Discord about his server being raided because a bunch of people joined to find out why the bid processing hadnâ€™t been run as expected. So you know what a bunch of nerds were up to on a Saturday night. Things were resolved by 22:00 Pacific time and the bidsâ€¦ were all pretty much uncontested.Â  It was an opportunity to grab some cheap picks, with the following being nabbed: Sniper Elite: Resistance Won by TAGN HQ (Wilhelm) with a bid of $3 F1 2025 Won by TAGN HQ (Wilhelm) with a bid of $1 WWE 2K25 Won by Rusty Shackleford (Shilgrod) with a bid of $5 Wonder Woman Won by Rusty Shackleford (Shilgrod) with a bid of $5 The Blood of Dawnwalker Won by Rusty Shackleford (Shilgrod) with a bid of $2 So there are some more titles on the board.Â  In addition, there was the one counter pick of the week: The Outer Worlds 2 Won by Rusty Shackleford (Shilgrod) with a bid of $2 ( Counter Pick) That is a bit of a gutsy one as The Outer Worlds was a well received title.Â  Also, I learned last week that counter picks are for keeps.Â  Once you grab them you cannot drop themâ€¦ so I am really hoping Microsoft doesnâ€™t announce pre-orders for the WoW Midnight expansion or Iâ€™ll be cooked on that front. Then we also had two titles ship for the league.Â  The first up was Cyanbaneâ€™s pick: Donkey Kong Country Returns HD [Picked by Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane)] Now has a score of 77.6 Not an outstanding score, but decent, putting 8 points on the board for Cyanbane. The next title up for a score was on Archeyâ€™s pick list: Dynasty Warriors: Origins [Picked by Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey)] [Counter Picked by Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane)] Now has a score of 82.3 A decent score, though it sank to 81 since then, but that still left 11 points for Archey.Â  However, we also got out first lesson in counter picks and Cyanbane had counter picked Archey which left him in negative point territory for the moment. The first counter pick victim Things are still early in the league and at least Cyanbane knows what his deficit it, but still no doubt a bit of a blow early on in the league. Now that we have points on the boardâ€¦ on player with points and another with negative pointsâ€¦ the league has sorted out with everybody else tied for second place. The standings for week 2 Again, the projections are based on the hype factor, which is a somewhat nebulous indicator and can vary quite a bit from the actual score of the title.Â  That said, while Cyanbane might be in last at the moment, the projection has him pegged for 5th place.Â  Weâ€™ll have to wait and see how that ends up. As it stands, the next title to launch in the league isnâ€™t slated until January 28th, so the score wonâ€™t change between now and then, save for the influence additional reviews might have on the two currently launched titles Meanwhile, over on the TAGN Discord server, I fiddled with the Discord bot settings to tone it down a bit, limiting to game launches and updates only about games that had been picked by the league. That led to a mid-week update after the Nintendo announcement of the Switch 2, during which a new Mario Kart game was shown.Â  That was enough to declare it a thing! Game name changed from Mario Kart (Unannounced Next Mainline Console Game) to Untitled NextMario Kart (Switch 2). Estimated release date changed from â€˜Unannouncedâ€™ to â€˜TBAâ€™. Announcement date changed from â€˜No Dateâ€™ to â€˜Thursday, January 16, 2025â€™. Note added: â€˜Maybe slightly controversial, but we decided that todayâ€™s trailer counts this as announced.â€™. Tags changed from New Game, Unannounced Game to New Game. Weâ€™ll see if it actually ships, but if it does Shintar will likely do well out of it.

and can vary quite a bit from the actual score of the title.Â  That said, while Cyanbane might be in last at the moment, the projection has him pegged for 5th place.Â  Weâ€™ll have to wait and see how that ends up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it stands, the next title to launch in the league isnâ€™t slated until January 28th, so the score wonâ€™t change between now and then, save for the influence additional reviews might have on the two currently launched titles\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, over on the TAGN Discord server, I fiddled with the Discord bot settings to tone it
