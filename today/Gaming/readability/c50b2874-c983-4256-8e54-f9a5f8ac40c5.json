The RTX 5080 is a 4K powerhouse, but that power is going to be wasted unless you're rocking a 240Hz 4K monitor.Forget RTX 5080, Get A RTX 4070 Super UK Deal And Thank Me LaterI decided to buy an RTX 4070 Super (The MSI model below specifically), which is amazing for 1440p gaming in my gaming rig. It delivers buttery smooth performance at nearly half the price, efficiently handling 1440p at over 150 FPS in modern games. You save a fortune, and guess what? You won't notice the difference in real-world gameplay either.RTX 4070 Super vs RTX 5080 – Specs BreakdownGPURTX 4070 SuperRTX 5080CUDA Cores7,16810,752VRAM12GB GDDR6X16GB GDDR7Memory Bus192-bit256-bitBoost Clock2.48 GHz2.7 GHzTDP220W360WMSRP£599£1,099+Yes, RTX 5080 is the better card on paper, but here's the catch — 1440p doesn't need that much raw power. The 4070 Super is more efficient, cheaper, and still crushes high-FPS gaming at 1440p. That 150+ FPS doesn't account for DLSS 3.0 either, which means even more frames when activated.RTX 4070 Super Benchmarks – 1440p PowerhouseBenchmarkFPSScoreMax FPSUnigine Heaven 4.0180.64,551399.1FurMark GL17610,587N/AUnigine Valley198.58305327.4Let's talk real-world numbers. The RTX 4070 Super dominates 1440p, comfortably pushing past 150 FPS in demanding games. This is insanely good performance, and the RTX 4070 Super does it while sipping power, meaning lower temps, less noise, and lower electricity bills. These results have been achieved by overclocking the MSI RTX 4070 Super OC 12GB model using MSI afterburner. GPU runs at 2760MHz and Memory at 10501 MHz with a temperature limit of 84°C. Don't you need that many frames? You can undervolt this graphics card and get nearly the same results. Suppose you're not sure about using MSI Afterburner. In that case, there's an option for Nvidia software to assess your gaming PC and automatically overclock RTX 4070 for you. These benchmarks were done alongside a well-balanced gaming setup featuring a 13th Gen Intel Core i5-13400F processor, a 10-core, 16-thread CPU that delivers solid gaming performance without breaking the bank. Paired with 64GB of Corsair Vengeance DDR4 RAM.Why RTX 4070 Super Makes More Sense for 1440pRTX 4070 Super perfectly matches 1440p 144Hz gaming, delivering high FPS without unnecessary overkill. It also costs nearly half the price of the RTX 5080 while offering almost identical real-world performance at 1440p. It runs cooler, quieter, and more efficiently thanks to its lower power draw, which means better thermals, less noise, and a longer lifespan. Plus, you're still getting next-gen AI features like DLSS 3, Frame Generation, and AI-powered upscaling, so your games look smooth and sharp without needing to brute-force raw performance.Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
