  "text": "Roombattle lets you and some friends deck out household appliances with sharp objects to see who can pop their opponent’s balloons. Ever wonder what robot vacuums do for fun? In this game, you get to control your own robot vacuum with a knife (or other pointy object) on the front and a bunch of balloons on the back, looking to pop all of your opponent’s balloons without getting your own cut up in the process. The levels themselves are rooms you might have in your home, with obstacles you might also have in your house as well. You’ll run into living rooms with big couches in the way and fans that can push you backwards. There’s also offices with tons of plants and bookshelves to destroy while you’re trying to smash into your friends. The destruction of the house by something that’s meant to be cleaning it only feeds into the chaos and wackiness of the game. There are plenty of kid-friendly battling games out there, but I do feel Roombattle has the potential to be a family favorite! I personally like how challenging it felt to pop the balloons, as they are behind the other player, so the movement feels very interesting as you try to stab your way through. You can unlock different accessories to customize the look of your robot and change the color, which I am sure will be a hit with kids as well. I got the chance to play a demo of Roombattle at Bilbao Independent Games Conference where the developers did not go easy on me! The game itself felt very complete and there were so many different levels to play through. There was also a level screen that showed that mini-games would be added in the future (which would bring a bit of breathing space to the battles that you’d also be taking on). Roombattle is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
