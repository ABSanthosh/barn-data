  "text": "Moida Mansion is a lighthearted take on old LCD games, tasking you with searching through objects to find secrets without being “Moida’d.” This game takes you to a dangerous (and randomized) home that your friends have wandered into while looking for their turtle. That turtle is the beloved mascot of The Adventure Club, though, so you can see why your buddies would have tried to find it. Did the turtle really need to go into a house that’s haunted by a murderous spectre, though? Well, if you keep your wits about you, you should be able to find the turtle and all your friends without dying yourself. So, to locate everyone, you’re going to need to do some looking around. Thankfully the monster has lousy eyesight so it’s not likely to see you wandering through the house. Once you start digging through its stuff, though, you’ll get its attention quickly. So, you need to listen for small clues or watch out for anything that looks out of place to figure out what’s worth searching. Pretty much any search will bring the monster close, so you want to be sure the danger is worthwhile. As the game is randomized, don’t expect to cheat to figure out what you need to search, either. Moida Mansion can be tense as the monster is pretty quick to find you, but running between rooms (so long as you don’t blunder into it) can get you to safety easily. The old LCD game look of the game also adds to a fun atmosphere, creating an experience that feels more like a Scooby Doo mystery than a flight from a killer monster. It’s quite a charming experience as you see how quickly you can figure out its quirks, and makes me wish that more of these games had shown this much skill in their execution when I was playing them as a kid. Moida Mansion is playable for free on itch.io.
