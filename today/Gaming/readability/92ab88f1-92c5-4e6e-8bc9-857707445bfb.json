With so many eyes on the big game, and brands bringing their best efforts, there are usually a few fun shorts to watch. We’ve rounded up the best Super Bowl 2025 commercials in one place.Charli XCX and Martha Stewart Spill SecretsAfter the roaring success of Brat Summer, Charli XCX shows up in this Super Bowl ad with Martha Stewart, where the two play a game of “we listen and we don’t judge.” Each participant shares an embarrassing or silly secret of some kind, and true to the name, neither can judge the other.Unfortunately, Martha doesn’t have as many interesting tidbits to share as you might think, considering she’s a felon, but I always like seeing Charli get some recognition. A second Uber Eats spot has Matthew McConaughey doing his best impression of Mike Ditka, the legendary Chicago Bears coach. The series of celebrity-filled shorts culminates in Uber Eats’ long-running commercial conspiracy theory that football was invented in order to sell food, with Greta Gerwig expressing some healthy skepticism.A mayo-induced orgasmThere’s a classic scene in the rom-com When Harry Met Sally when Meg Ryan, in order to prove a point, fakes an orgasm mid-meal. This Super Bowl ad has Ryan reconnnect with Billy Crystal in the same deli, where Crystal remarks that he’s surprised they were able to return. Meg Ryan, unable to stop old habits, adds a dose of Hellmann’s mayonnaise to her sandwich and has a similarly over-the-top response. I can safely say I didn’t have “mayo so good it makes you orgasm” on my Super Bowl 2025 bingo card.The Slow and LuxuriousVin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and Ludacris all reunite, but instead of driving in high-speed contests of life and death, Diesel and Rodriguez are just having a charming drive while enjoying some ice cream. Things can’t always be fast and furious, I suppose. Frankly, I’d just like to see this concept expanded into a full feature film. Sometimes I get stressed watching high-octane contests between the world’s most skilled drivers as they learn the meaning of family. It can be a little much.The mustache madness continues at PringlesWhen I think about Pringles, I think of the long, tube-shaped packaging and their logo, an affable little cartoon man with a mustache. Last year, Chris Pratt grew a mustache in a Super Bowl ad for Pringles. This year, the company recruited Nick Offerman, Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, and LA Clippers guard James Harden to watch their famous mustaches detach and fly away on a mission to retrieve more Pringles for a party. A sky full of mustaches flap gloriously onward, bearing tubes of Pringles. It’s majestic, if an ineffective chip delivery mechanism.Eyebrows a-flyingWeirdly enough, this isn’t the only advertisement that revolves around flying facial hair. Eugene Levy enjoys a treat from Little Caesars, only for his eyebrows to fly off his face in amazement and go on a world tour. They stop by to visit his daughter, ambush a jogger, perch on a baby’s face, win over some furry worms, and eventually return to Levy’s face. It’s a novel way to draw attention to a very small-sized pizza snack, but I’m not sure if I like the idea of associating hair with food.Coffee-Mate’s unnerving concertShania Twain lends her vocals to a short advertisement for Coffee-Mate’s cold foam, which allows for a whipped-cream-like layer of luxury to be easily added to someone’s morning coffee. The advertisement proposes that this would be so delightful that it would inspire a metaphorical concert in your mouth, complete with a tongue writhing and dancing to Shania’s singing. Personally, I like my tongue to simply register the taste of something, not flail wildly to a country legend, but that’s just me.Willem Dafoe, Catherine O’Hara: Sports iconsA fun spot where iconic actors Willem Dafoe and Catherine O’Hara take on professional athletes in a game of pickleball, all to win beer. It’s a silly concept, but works because it’s Willem Dafoe and Catherine O’Hara.Silly sloths struggle with societyIn my personal favorite of the bunch, Coors paid for a one-minute ad that attempts to capture the slow pace of a post-Super Bowl Monday fugue. In this world, everyone is a giant sloth, a noble and majestic beast. However, these wonderful creatures struggle with tasks like office life, shopping at the store, fitting in a workout, domestic chores, and more. Frankly, I’m right there with those sloths; this is highly relatable content. The best gag is probably the “slow-speed chase” at a bank, where cop sloths slowly lumber after sloth robbers.",
