The studio, however, has been plagued with issues before today's layoffs; earlier this year, we at IGN ran an extensive report about its internal struggles with toxicity, hate speech, crunch, and more.Life Is Strange: Double Exposure developer Deck Nine has announced its second round of layoffs in 2024. Deck Nine announced the last round of layoffs in February. Prior to those layoffs, IGN understood the studio employed roughly between 100 and 130 staffers. It's unclear how many remain after the two rounds of layoffs this year. Deck Nine laid off around 30 employees in May 2023 as well. The original developer of Life Is Strange, Don't Nod, also announced layoffs in October after canceling two in-development projects amid a reorganization.Today's Deck Nine announcement is unfortunately only the latest layoff news to hit the games industry as the year wraps up. Earlier this week, Ubisoft revealed that it would be shutting down two production studios and laying off 277 employees in the process.
