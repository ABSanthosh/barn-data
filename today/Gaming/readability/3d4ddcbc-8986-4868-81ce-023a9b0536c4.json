Gimme 5 days, gimme 5 days, gimme 5 days… We heard last week that Capsuleer Day, the annual celebration of the launch of the game, would be moved to begin on April 15th rather than its usual early May time.  (The game launched on May 6, 2003.) CCP seems to want to drag that event into its high sec drifter event that has been running for months now.  So, to prime the pump, they are also handing out five days of Omega time. But not really for the event… I think. The five days of Omega time is available RIGHT NOW and will continue to be available until April 14th, which is the day BEFORE Capsuleer Day kicks off.  So, at best, you will have four days of Omega during the event itself unless you time it just right and go to the in-game New Eden at 23:59 and claim it at the last second. And even then, 23:59 UTC is 16:00 local time for me currently, so not really a big advantage. Still, five days is five days.  I went and claimed it on my main account, which was subscribed already, so that just added five days to my current subscription time… which runs out in May 2026.  I buy Omega time when it is on sale. I will figure out what to do with my Alpha clone accounts this weekend.  If nothing else, five days of training time has some value.
