The Govee Pixel Light, which was first unveiled at CES 2025, is finally available for purchase for immediate delivery. This is essentially a 52x32 or 32x32 LED array panel that allows you to display personalized content. Prices start at $119.99 with free shipping, but there's a 30% off coupon code \"PX30\". This would make for a very cool toy for streamers, or maybe even for tech savvy and gadget-happy dads, since Father's Day is fast approaching.Save 30% Off Govee's New Pixel LightGovee Pixel Light (52x32)Govee Pixel Light (32x32)Govee's new Pixel Light comes in two sizes. The smaller 32x32 size features a total of 1,024 LED arrays and the larger 52x32 size features a total of 1,664 LED arrays. You can display static images, but animations are its bread and butter because the panel is capable of displaying moving images at a smooth 30 frames per second. If you just want to plug it in and have it work without any fiddling, Govee has already preloaded useful widgets like weather forecast, NBA schedules, Bitcoin, and countdown timers. There's even a trained AI model that will pre-select or custom create animations and scenes for you depending on what you type in the text prompt.There have been other pixel displays in the past, but the pixel arrays are either too chunky, the framerate is too slow to be anything but a gimmick, or the software is borderline unusable. The Govee Pixel Light has a display that's both sharp and smooth, features a relatively intuitive user interface, and is well-priced compared to other similar types of lights.
