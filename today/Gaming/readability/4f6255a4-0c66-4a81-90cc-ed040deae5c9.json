  "text": "\"When workers come together to build power, we become able to ensure a brighter future for all.\" Image credit: Blizzard Almost 200 Overwatch developers working at Activision Blizzard have unionised, joining the Communications Workers of America (CWA) after the \"overwhelming majority\" of workers signed up. A wall-to-wall unit - now known as The Overwatch Gamemakers Guild-CWA (OWGG-CWA) - the union includes game developers across all disciplines, including design, production, engineering, art, sound, and quality assurance. Newscast: Xbox currently has more first-party games coming to PlayStation 5 this year than Sony Xbox currently has more first-party games coming to PlayStation 5 this year than Sony.Watch on YouTube \"The massive layoffs in the video game industry, and at my own studio, became one of the first reasons I started to learn about how to organise to create a healthier workplace for everyone,\" said Frank Le Cocq, VFX artist and organising committee member. \"When we began our union efforts, it was empowering to know that our coworkers next door at World of Warcraft had already successfully gone through the process.\" \"California continues to be a hub for video game organising, and we are excited to welcome Overwatch game developers to CWA alongside our video game union siblings at World of Warcraft and SEGA of America,\" said CWA Local 9510 President Jason Justice. \"When workers come together to build power, we become able to ensure a brighter future for all.\" Microsoft has recognised the union alongside the other 2100+ plus Microsoft workers who have formed a union with the CWA. As game development becomes increasingly insecure all over the world, more and more developers and performers are organising collective bargaining. Following news of the SAG-AFTRA strike last year, Equity stated it stood \"in solidarity\", but would not be authorising a strike. It did, however, recently call on the games industry to improve conditions for performers, and a protest took place outside last month's BAFTA Games Awards as Equity members held placards reading \"Union contracts in gaming now\". Last month, the US union warned of \"alarming loopholes\" for \"AI abuse\" in the latest proposal to end industrial action. Negotiators on behalf of video game companies responded that \"meaningful progress\" had been made.",
