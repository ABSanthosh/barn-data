  "text": "Image: Nintendo / KotakuNintendo’s upcoming video game console, the Switch 2, will include a nifty feature that will help protect your battery and keep it running for a long time. And all you have to do is sacrifice a bit of playtime.Suggested ReadingThis Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari FansOffEnglishSuggested ReadingAs revealed today via the Nintendo Today mobile app, the $450 Switch 2 will ship in June with a feature that will let you prevent the console from fully charging its internal battery. This optional battery preservation option will instead see the device max out at around 90 percent. This means that if you have the setting on, your battery will rarely, if ever, be fully charged, costing you some playtime when out and about. So why would anybody choose to use it? Well, because its really good for the Switch 2's rechargeable lithium battery. These types of batteries can degrade over time if kept in a fully charged state. This is why you shouldn’t leave a phone or tablet plugged in overnight to charge while you sleep, as it can quickly ruin your battery and make it die faster.Sacrificing 30 minutes to an hour or so of Switch 2 battery time in exchange for a device that will last longer and hold a charge better for years to come seems like a smart trade. I’m happy to see Nintendo following in the footsteps of Apple and Google and other tech giants which have been including similar battery limiting options in new devices for a few years now. And by making it optional, it means that people can still decide to fully charge up the Switch 2 if they’re getting ready for a long plane ride and want that extra juice. Personally, when the Switch 2 launches on June 5, I’ll be quickly hopping into the settings menu to turn on this nifty little battery saver option ASAP.   .",

The real sweet spot for a battery is 50 percent charge as that means that half of its moveable lithium ions are in the lithium cobalt oxide layer and the other half are in the graphite layer. This equilibrium puts the least amount of strain on the battery, and extends the number of charge cycles it can withstand before degrading.  So really, if you were super-keen on keeping your battery living as long as possible, you should keep its charge between 20 and 80 per cent. This means that it spends as little time as possible with lots of lithium ions crammed into either layer, a situation which causes the layers to expand, putting physical strain on them. “But if you did that you’d only be getting about half as much charge every time you used it,” Griffith says. Maybe not, then.  Charging past 100 percent will damage your battery True (but not for the reason you think)  This one is closely linked to the above myth. Charging your phone so it stays at 100 percent overnight isn’t great news for the battery, but that’s not because you’re cramming in more charge than it can handle. A “trickle charge” mechanism cuts off the charger after the phone has reached 100 per cent charge, and only tops up the battery when it drops down a little.  The problem is that you’re keeping the charge level at 100 per cent which, as we know from the previous myth, puts the battery under a certain amount of strain. “It’s not good,” Griffith says, “but the battery manufacturer has set [the battery’s limits] it so it shouldn’t be harmful.”\u0026#34;,{\u0026#34;metric25\u0026#34;:1}]]\" href=\"http://You should let the battery get all the way down to 0 percent before recharging False  Strangely enough, batteries are under the most strain when they’re fully charged or completely empty.
