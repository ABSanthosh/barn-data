  "text": "Image credit: Rock Paper Shotgun The RTX 5060 Ti is easily one of the standout GPUs from Nvidia’s troubled Blackwell generation. Stick with the 16GB edition (rather than the afterthought 8GB) and it’ll comfortably handle high quality settings on 1080p and 1440p, helped along by DLSS 4 and, if you fancy it, Multi Frame Generation. It also accounted for many of the better-priced RTX 50 graphics cards at launch, and as part of Amazon Prime Day, we’re finally starting to see some further cost cutting – including to one model at Amazon UK that’s dropped below £400. That, specifically, would be the MSI GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16G Inspire 2X OC, which despite its naming excess is in fact a prim-and-proper graphics card seemingly designed for pro workstations. It’s still a gaming GPU underneath the understated shell, mind, of the calibre that can pull a slick 75fps in Ultra-quality Cyberpunk: 2077 at a non-upscaled 1440p. £390 puts this right at the bottom of the 16GB RTX 5060 Ti price range I’ve seen so far, too. UK deal: Over in the US, the altogether more gamer-lookin’ Asus Dual GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB OC Edition is down to an agreeable $430. That’s $50 off the list price, and again, comfortably among the cheapest RTX 5060 Ti models you’re likely to find without resorting to the (currently very limited) secondhand market. Or getting an 8GB version. But, don’t. US deal: I haven’t used either of these models myself, but I’ve never had issues with MSI partner cards, and the worst I’ve seen from Asus cards is a faulty LED on my old GTX 1080. The underlying RTX 5060 Ti GPU is, once again, a good’un, and it’s even been a few weeks since I’ve experienced any driver problems on my RTX 50 testing cards. Yay?",
