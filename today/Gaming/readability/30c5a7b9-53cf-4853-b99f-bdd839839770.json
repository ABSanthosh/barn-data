Dell is currently offering this Alienware Aurora R16 GeForce RTX 4090 gaming PC for $2999.99 after a massive $1,000 instant discount. This PC is equipped with the most powerful Intel CPU and NVIDA GPU currently available, as well as a whopping 64GB of DDR5 RAM and a spacious 2TB SSD. This PC will run any game in 4K with ultra settings and ray tracing enabled and still pump out high framerates, even in the newest, most demanding titles like Black Myth: Wukong or Warhammer Space Marine 2.$1000 Off the Alienware Aurora R16 RTX 4090 Gaming PCAlienware Aurora R16 Liquid-Cooled Intel Core i9-14900KF RTX 4090 Gaming PC with 64GB RAM, 2TB SSDThis config is equipped with an Intel Core i9-14900KF CPU, GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, 64GB of DDR5-5200MHz RAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. The unlocked 14th gen Intel Core i9-14900KF Raptor Lake \"Refresh\" CPU boasts a max Turbo clock of 6GHz with 24 cores, 32 threads, and a 36MB cache. This is the most powerful consumer Intel CPU you can get right now. The chip is known to run pretty hot, but fortunately it's cooled by a robust 240mm all-in-one liquid cooler. The entire system is powered by an energy efficient 1000W 80PLUS Platinum power supply.The RTX 4090 is likewise the most powerful GPU on the market. No other video card, either from NVIDIA or from AMD, comes close. In his RTX 4090 review, Chris Coke writes \"The RTX 4090 may be huge and expensive, but holy smokes if it doesn’t blow the competition out of the water... Until the rest of the pack can catch up, between its impressive hardware specs and its DLSS 3 AI wizardry, even the $1,599 price doesn’t seem unreasonable for the unrivaled frame rates that this card can crank out.\" The 4090 is also the consumer card of choice for AI thanks to the fact that it has 24GB RAM.A note on Alienware's newest \"R16\" desktop chassisThe R16 is Alienware's current 2024 desktop PC design. It's 40% smaller in volume compared to previous iterations. It features a simple yet proven airflow pattern; air is drawn in through the side intake vents over the GPU area and a 120mm fan at the front of the case, and exhausts by way of a 120mm rear fan and two 120mm top fans. A 240mm radiator for the all-in-one liquid cooling system is mounted to these top fans. Some configurations don't actually include the liquid cooling system, but we rarely include them in this roundup. That's because Alienware's liquid cooling solution is far superior to their stock air cooling and is easily worth the price premium.Should You Wait for Black Friday?In most cases, we would say that Black Friday has the best deals of the year. Dell, however, is quite the opposite. Historically, Black Friday hasn't always been the best time to buy an Alienware computer. The best time of year to score Dell deals are usually Memorial Day and during September and October, right after the back-to-school rush but about a month before actual Black Friday. Either way, the deals that are going on right now are quite good. Some of them are the best prices of the year (like the RTX 4070 Ti PC) and some are not.For more deals on Alienware computers, check out Dell's Early Black Friday Sale.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
