You can save 20% off the Hoto Snapbloq, a modular collection of precision powered tools, with a set of three tools currently selling for $209.99 after a $50 discount. That brings each set down to $69.99, and they normally retail for $99.99 apiece. Hoto is a pretty well known brand that's popular on Amazon and even sold at Costco.20% Off Hoto's New SnapBloq Modular Electric Tool KitsHoto SnapBloq Electric Mini Screwdriver, Drill, and Rotary Tool SetsHoto's introductory SnapBloq combo includes an electric precision screwdriver set, an electric mini drill set, and an electric mini rotary set. They're all contained in separate boxes that snap together for convenience. Right now, these three tools are the only ones in the SnapBloq lineup, but Hoto plans to release more tools in the future.The precision screwdriver is more powerful than the Hoto variants you'll find on Amazon, with a 0.5Nm torque rating (vs 0.3Nm). It features a brushless motor, an 800mAh battery with up to 60 minutes of runtime and USB Type-C charging, and a built-in LED for handy illumination. It's perfect for those tiny screws that require specialized miniature bits.The mini drill features a 0.1Nm torque rating, three adjustable speed settings up to 1,200RPM, and twenty drill bits. It's pretty obvious this drill won't replace your full sized power drill or impact driver, but it's powerful enough to poke through plastics, wood, PCBs (like circuit boards), and resin.The mini rotary drill features stepless speed adjustment and can spin up to 22,000RPM. The battery can last up to 30 minutes on a single charge. Rotary tools have many different practical uses and so this kit includes a variety of bits for different tasks like drilling, routing, sanding, and polishing.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
