  "text": "The DOOM Slayer is back, and as we count down the days until you can explore the medieval world of DOOM: The Dark Ages, you’ll need the right tools to get the job done. Introducing the Xbox Wireless Controller – DOOM: The Dark Ages Limited Edition, Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 – DOOM: The Dark Ages Limited Edition, and the Xbox Series X Wrap – DOOM: The Dark Ages Limited Edition. This collection celebrates DOOM and the latest chapter in the franchise’s storied history. From the runes adorning each piece, to specific homages like the matte green armor and the Mark of the Slayer, every detail in this collection has been thoughtfully selected to capture the essence of the DOOM universe. If you’re going to be the Slayer, you better look the part – gear up with the Limited Edition Xbox Wireless Controller in battle-worn green and silver. Crowned with 3D silver helmet spikes at the top and silver-plated sheathing on the two sides, this controller was forged for a demon-slaying super weapon. With additional touches like a rubberized, leather-like grip, a red thumbstick to match the chest port, and blood splatter resulting from your Shield Saw, every detail is crafted with the DOOM fan in mind. The Xbox Wireless Controller – DOOM: The Dark Ages Limited Edition also includes the DOOM Slayer Executioner Skin DLC for DOOM: The Dark Ages (game sold separately) so you can jump right into the action adorned with the skin’s deep red and green metallic luster. For those looking to take their game to the next level, look no further than the DOOM: The Dark Ages Limited Edition Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2. Our most advanced controller lets you become a living super weapon. The bold Mark of the Slayer serves as the focal point at the center of the controller, while the transparent red top case—infused with ember-like flakes—evokes the feeling of gazing into the fiery depths of Hell. Fans who demand precision in battle can fine-tune their settings through the Xbox Accessories App, adjust features like shorter hair trigger locks, adjustable-tension thumbsticks, and swap in interchangeable components. With additional paddles, thumbsticks, and a carrying case included, you have endless ways to customize your Elite controller to fit your playstyle. Finally, Xbox Series X owners can customize their console even further with the DOOM: The Dark Ages Limited Edition console wrap. Transform your console into an omen of DOOM, featuring dark, towering rock shattered by the bright red Mark of the Slayer. On the inside, unspeakable inscriptions and symbols from the deepest levels of Hell are etched into the design, sealed away by the wrap’s easy-to-install Velcro strap – no tools or adhesives required. Whether you own the Xbox Series X with a disc drive or the All-Digital version, the wrap works seamlessly, thanks to a removable disc cover. Crafted with solid panels and a high-tech fabric exterior, this wrap delivers a precision fit and premium finish for your Xbox Series X. The Xbox Wireless Controller – DOOM: The Dark Ages Limited Edition is available now for $79.99 USD ERP exclusively at the Microsoft Store – for a limited time only. Grab yours early at the Microsoft Store or check later with other local retailers before they’re gone. The Xbox Elite Series 2 – DOOM: The Dark Ages Limited Edition is available for pre-order today for $199.99 USD ERP and will be released on April 25. The Xbox Series X Wrap – DOOM: The Dark Ages Limited Edition is available now for $54.99 USD ERP. Both the Elite Series 2 controller and the Series X wrap are available exclusively at the Microsoft Store while supplies last.",
