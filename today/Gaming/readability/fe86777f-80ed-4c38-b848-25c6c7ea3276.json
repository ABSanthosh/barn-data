My TV graphic… AI generated garbage, but I needed something Oh yeah, so I haven’t written one of these since back in January, which means I’ve probably forgotten more shows we’ve watched than I have written about below.  Anyway, on to the latest installment. The English – Amazon Prime A BBC/Amazon production, so it is wall to wall Brits in the cast.  It features sex, murder, betrayal, revenge, and syphilis in an exploration of the taming of the west after the US Civil War.  Specifically, Emily Blunt has shown up from England with revenge in her heart and a pile of cash in her bags that leads to no end of trouble.  Worth the effort, but there is some effort involved in keeping the story, players, and the sequence of events straight as it does jump back and forth in time.  An actual mini-series with no pretense of there needing to be another season or anything, so you can watch it and feel done. Nobody Wants This – Netflix In case anybody needed confirmation that I’ll watch any romantic comedy, no matter how silly the premise, so long as it features Kristen Bell… well, let this one seal the deal I guess.  This time around Kristen plays a non-religious woman who has a successful sex and dating podcast with her sister ending up dating Noah, an up and coming young rabbi who has just broken up with his girlfriend, Rebecca, who was in love… with at least the idea of being the wife of somebody who might end up being the head rabbi at their congregation.   His family and friends are all against his new love interest while Kristen’s sister thinks she’s become boring with this new relationship which is hurting the podcast. Features Timothy Simons, who was Jonah Ryan in Veep, being… essentially Jonah again.  Hate for people to get typecast, but he is so good at it.  We burned through this in two sittings.  Now waiting for season 2. Also, I want to point out that, of the actors playing Noah’s parents, the mother is my mom’s age and the father is my age, which is kind of the reverse of the usual age split for TV couples. Bad Monkey – AppleTV+ Also on the list of people whose stuff we’ll watch no matter what is Vince Vaughn, probably best known for The Wedding Crashers, but who got his start in Swingers.  You’re so money.  Anyway, the first episode starts out all over the place and you’re happy when at least there is a monkey involved part way through, but it isn’t clear how any of it ties together. The story ties together even if it is pretty silly.  But is competent enough to keep you engaged in what is otherwise mostly a vehicle for Vince Vaughn to act like Vince Vaughn.  If that is what you came for… and that was clearly on our agenda… then this will suit you.  Also, there is brief role by Zach Braff, who I think of as “the young guy in Scrubs” who is suddenly much older than I expected… and a shout out to the “previously” segment at the start of each episode that features a narrator that gets more angry and exasperated about needing to explain things as the show goes on.   As a murder mystery, well, Vince ain’t no Travis McGee… but he is Vince Vaughn. Slow Horses – Season 4 – AppleTV+ The agony and the ecstasy of Slow Horses is that there are no wasted, throw away, or filler episodes in each season.  Everything is filled up with essentials and you’d best be paying attention and not looking at your phone… unless you’re like me and you read the books.  But that means if it only takes six episodes to tell the story, then you get six episodes.  Not ten.  Not eight.  No irrelevant diversions into the back stories of Lamb or Taverner or Cartwright.. which is a bit of a shame, actually, because the books actually do delve into such things.  In fact, there are short stories that setup a number of the books if you want to simply marinate in details not necessary to the plot. But the show, the show sticks straight to the core of the story and does not let itself get diverted, and is probably the better for it.  Waiting for the next season… again. Sugar – AppleTV+ We watched this one, I forgot about it, remembered it, then decided to include it.  We almost gave up it.  We started it because Colin Farrell is the star then almost stumbled because it kicks off as the most fatuous over blown cliche detective noir bullshit you could possibly come up with.  If you put a detective in LA in fancy suits and driving a classic Corvette you better be able to explain yourself.   Seriously, omniscient pretentious know it all private eyes… you think you’re writing like Raymond Chandler?  Well, you’re not! That lasts for three episodes… and we took a two week pause after episode three… then in the fourth everything you thought was going on gets blown up and you have to dial back in your brain to reconcile what you now know versus what you were thinking at the time.  We binged the back half of the series on a Friday night. The Serpent Queen – Starz One of those Starz dramatic period pieces that we like, this time about Catherine de’ Medici marrying into the French royal court where Colm Meaney plays King Francis I whose son, the eventual Henry II of France, is her spouse. The first season is the better of the two as it involves Catherine summing up her story for a potential apprentice to her court while breaking the fourth wall to give us insights into her thinking and wry observations in the spirit of Francis Urquhart in the original House of Cards. The second season isn’t bad… hey, it includes Minnie Driver showing up as a somewhat bawdy Elizabeth I… and plays out much of what was set up in the first season, but that doesn’t leave Catherine much room to talk directly to us… and, I missed that from the first season.  Still entertaining, and all the more so if you go over to Wikipedia on your phone while you’re watching and look up the individuals represented in the story and their fates and to see who comes out on top in the end.",
