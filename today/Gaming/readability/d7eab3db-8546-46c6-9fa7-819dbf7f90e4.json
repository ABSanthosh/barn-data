Today's Triple-I showcase delivered exactly that, though I have to admit it's pretty brief, and doesn't show all that much. The game's sixth update, Thralls of Twilight, is due out sometime in May, and seems to come with some big additions. For one, there's new enemies that \"creep, crawl, and stalk you further,\" which sounds… pleasant. The update will give you a few more reasons to dive into the shroud too. There's more resources, the ability to unlock a new weapons customisation mechanic, and more besides that. Improvements have also apparently been made to the game's nighttime cycle, as there'll be enemy groups going around the world at night with some new rewards you can find too. Gems are also being added that'll let you can attach to your weapons that all have special effects. Enshrouded - Thralls of Twilight Trailer | The Triple-i Initiative Watch on YouTube Enshrouded's creative director Antony Christoulakis had a chat with PCGamer recently too, where he explained that this update is focused on the shroud so much because it's \"not strong enough yet from our perspective. So, we introduced new enemies that are coming with the next update, as well as improving the topology and adding more points of interest to these [shrouded regions], and also some new mechanics that hopefully make combat also more interesting.\" The game has been out in early access for a little over a year now, and the intention was originally that it would be out within a year, but obviously the game needs a bit more time. It's also 20% off on Steam at the moment, so now seems like a good time to pick it up if you're so inclined.",
