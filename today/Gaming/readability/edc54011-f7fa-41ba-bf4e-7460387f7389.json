Instead of paying hundreds of dollars to grab these games individually, you can get all eight games for just $11.99 at Humble Bundle for this month only.Humble Choice Games for February 2025Humble Choice - February 2025Immortals of AveumTrepang2Total War: Pharoah DynastiesFabledomGriftlandsTales \u0026 TacticsNaheulbeuk's Dungeon MasterMy Little UniverseEach month, Humble Choice curates a selection of games for members to redeem. These games are sent as Steam codes, which are yours to keep forever. You can even send them to a friend if you already have the game or want to gift one! For February, Immortals of Aveum is well worth the price of this package alone, receiving an 8/10 in our review:\"Immortals of Aveum is an impressively confident first-person shooter that successfully trades muzzles and magazines for mages and magic. Its fast-paced, spellcasting combat is both satisfying to master and spectacular to look at, and it features a lengthy and hearty campaign packed with secrets to keep us going well after the story has wrapped. As someone who desperately hopes that unapologetically single-player shooters will live forever, these Immortals have done a great job of making sure they’re definitely not dead yet.\"In addition to these games, you can also score up to 20% off select games on the Humble Store. The longer that you have an active subscription, the more rewards you can unlock. 5% of each Humble Choice purchase also supports a charity that rotates monthly, with February's supporting United Negro College Fund, an organization that works to increase the total annual number of African American college graduates. Don't miss out on this month's Humble Choice selection!Originally posted: Feb 4, 2025 10:15 pmIn This Article",
