So right from the get go I was pretty easily won over by Lost Skies, another one of those open world survival crafting type games. It's a genre I'm not easily won over by, I don't care for building things all that much, but the pull of the open air is pretty alluring to me. And I won't even have very long to see if I'll bounce off of its craftiness or not, because developer Bossa Studios announced today that Lost Skies is releasing into early access later this month on April 18th. Being one of those kinds of games, there's the usual kinds of things you can expect in terms of building things, though the main thing you'll be building is your skyship. It looks pretty intricate too, lots of different parts you can attach and wiggle around. You can then take your ship out on large scale dogfights, which look a bit intimidating to be honest, but I'm sure a seasoned enough crew will be fine. Lost Skies | Release Date Reveal Trailer | Humble Games Watch on YouTube Speaking of your crew, you can play with up to five friends (or enemies, I suppose, that just doesn't sound very fun) as you explore the game's first region, the Outskirts. Future updates will apparently expand this area, as well as add in more places to explore, alongside general bug fixes, quality of life improvements, and a few additional features. One thing I quite like is the game's Island Creator, which you can already download separately. This is exactly what it sounds like, you can build and design your own islands, and in the main game you'll be able to download islands other people have made. Honestly this looks like enough of a game in its own right, kudos to Bossa Studios for fitting something like this in. If you're not an early access person, Bossa Studios said they are currently planning to release it into 1.0 sometime this year, but otherwise, you can check it out April 18th.",
