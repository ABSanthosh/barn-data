It’s impossible to keep up with everything hitting the digital space, whether it be Premium Video on Demand (PVOD) or a traditional streaming network. With that in mind, we figured it was well past time for us to whip up a little something to help you keep up (and catch up) with all there is to watch in the big, wide world of digital viewing. And thus, the Streaming Rewind was born! We’ll update this list at the end of each week so you can check out what you may have missed, and what’s coming up on the weekend. We’ll keep it a mix of popular releases and noteworthy lesser-known titles to help you find what’s worth taking the risk on as well as dive into a few things that we loved and why we loved ‘em, or just break down a show or movie that left us with some opinions. Sometimes, we’ll even have guest entries from other members of the IGN staff. If you’re not interested in all that and just want to see a bulleted list of what’s out there, pop on down to the New and Noteworthy and ICYMI sections.The Ugly Stepsister (Shudder)Currently known as a movie so gruesome that it made people throw up in the theater, The Ugly Stepsister is now on Shudder. Disney’s history with the title terminology means that when people hear “Cinderella” they immediately think of a demure and unassuming maiden searching for her prince charming while being mistreated by her stepmother and step-siblings, but this iteration of the story hits way closer to the Grimm brothers’ dark fable that the Disney film adapts. Only, y’know… with even more body horror. So, if you’ve been waiting to throw up in your house instead of a movie theater, now’s your chance! Queen of the Ring (Digital and Demand)If I had a nickel for every time a former member of Team Arrow starred in a wrestling property, I would have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it’s happened twice. Emily Bett Richards — formerly Felicity Smoak on Arrow — plays wrestling legend Mildred Burke in this biopic, which also happens to feature plenty of real wrestlers like Toni Storm (who is currently rocking the best gimmick in pro wrestling as Timeless Toni Storm, an old Hollywood dilettante) and Trinity Fatu (also known as Naomi on WWE). Highly recommend this one for history buffs and wrestling fans alike. Move over Stephen Amell, Emily’s coming for your championship. Wick Is Pain (Digital and Demand) If you enjoy the John Wick franchise and miss the time when special features gave you a reason to dig in deeper on your DVDs and Blu-rays, you’re probably going to enjoy Wick Is Pain. It’s a quick watch, delivering an easy 80-minutes of Wickian goodness. The movie features interviews with Wick himself, Keanu Reeves, director Chad Stahelski, and producer Basil Iwanyk.New and Noteworthy This Week: Warfare, May 6 — Digital and demandPoker Face Season 2, May 8 — PeacockQueen of the Ring, May 9 — Digital and demandThe Ugly Stepsister, May 9 — Digital, demand, and ShudderWick Is Pain, May 9 — Digital and demandBAFTAs, May 11 — BritBoxICYMI: If you had too much going on last week, here are some of the notable things that premiered or debuted on streaming and digital that you may have missed.Drop, April 29 — Digital and demandDeath of a Unicorn, April 29 — Digital and demandAnother Simple Favor, May 1 — Prime VideoThe Four Seasons, May 1 — NetflixRust, May 1 — Digital and demandStar Wars: Tales of the Underworld, May 4 — Digital and demandThe Walking Dead: Dead City, May 4 — AMC \u0026 AMC+In This ArticleNot yet available for streaming.",
