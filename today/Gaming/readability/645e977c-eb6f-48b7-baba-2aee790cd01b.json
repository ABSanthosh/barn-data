  "text": "Over the years, many of you have participated in various beta programs across Sony Interactive, which has helped us deliver the best possible gaming experiences to gamers around the world. And we’re truly grateful for your participation. That’s why I’m pleased to introduce the Beta Program at PlayStation initiative. It’s an easier, more consolidated way for gamers to sign up to participate in future PlayStation betas across a wide range of PlayStation experiences.  The Beta Program at PlayStation will create an easy, centralized place for you to register your interest in a range of future PlayStation betas. A single registration for Beta Program at PlayStation will allow you to express interest in gaining beta access to test participating games for the PS5 console and PC, new PS5 console features, PlayStation App features, and even user experience features on PlayStation.com. You only need to sign up once to express interest in these various betas, and if you receive an invitation to a specific beta, it’s up to you to decide whether you’d like to participate or not. Here are the requirements: Players must have a valid account for PlayStation Network in good standing with a current email address. Accounts with restrictions or violations may not be eligible for participation. Players must live in the region where Beta Program at PlayStation is available. Players must meet the legal age requirement for their region. It’s free to join and registration will begin to open up globally starting today at playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/. Please check back later if the page is not yet available in your region.  Additionally, while we try to include as many players as possible in our beta programs, sometimes we may get more interest than we can accommodate. By joining this program, it enables you to be considered for beta participation, but it doesn’t guarantee selection for a beta test. Just something to remember! And again, a big thanks to those of you who have participated in all of the betas we’ve offered across Sony Interactive over the years. It’s about to get easier and more convenient.  Trending Stories",
