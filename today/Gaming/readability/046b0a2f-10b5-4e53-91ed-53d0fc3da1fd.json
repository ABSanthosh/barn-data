  "text": "Ah, hello again little Visitor. It’s been a while, but we’re so pleased to see you here in the Spiral, ready to discover more about one of the picturesque amusements you’ll be touring in Little Nightmares III, coming to your PS5 and PS4 on October 10, 2025. When you enter the world of Little Nightmares, you’ll be visiting the Nowhere, a vast and surreal land where the odds are stacked against you; where children must use their wits and courage to survive. It’s a place made for adults, you see. Where the rotten cruelty of the grown-up world is an ever-present danger, constantly permutating into new and frightening places and hosting new Residents to populate them. This time, you’ll play Low and Alone, best friends ever since they found each other in this lonely nightmare. They have been traveling together in search of what every Visitor wants: an escape from the Nowhere. Like other Visitors, they’ve been through many harrowing moments, only surviving thanks to their teamwork and quick thinking. Now, they have a plan that will supposedly let them leave this unpleasant dream behind, but to get to their destination, they’ll have to explore, hide, and even defend themselves, working together as a team. Today, let’s go on an outing to Carnevale. Low and Alone find themselves on a rainy pier in the middle of the night. In the distance, the glow of lights beckons, and once again, the smell of candied treats lingers in the air. They are suddenly in the midst of a ramshackle fun fair, faded greasepaint and flickering bulbs shout distractions from every direction. Fortunately for the children, the local Herd are too busy playing rigged games and eating Factory sweets to notice the children sneaking around – unless they draw too much attention… That being said, there are times when drawing the attention of the Herd is advantageous. Sometimes, you can lure these lumbering creatures into danger or use them to destroy obstacles to your progress. Then, it’s simply a matter of escaping before they can catch up to you. That shouldn’t be too hard, right, little ones? Each broken-down attraction is hosted by a puppet barker with no visible strings and unpiloted by any visible hands. These child-sized marionettes are not very welcoming to Visitors, and will attack any little guest who wanders too close for comfort. With a bit of cooperation between Low’s bow and Alone’s wrench, they can disable these pugnacious puppets before they can strike. It might seem like an atypically pleasant place for the Nowhere, with the relatively cheerful atmosphere, but not all is well in this three-ringed circus.  You can see it in the rotted planks of the pier, the strangled customers standing in for pinatas; and yet, the Herd marches on through the midway, dazzled by strings of flickering carbon lights and tantalized by the sighing pipes of a distant calliope, all of them unaware that death is lurking somewhere among the sodden painted canvas walls of the Carnevale big top tents. As Low and Alone stowaway on the rickety rollercoaster headed for the main attraction, they have no idea what terrors might be waiting for them on the other side.  Someone is running this show, but who?
