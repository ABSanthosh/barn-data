I suppose there is some awful irony at play in that here that, on the day when we remember Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we’re also ushering a toxic and racist presidential administration.  But I guess the show must go on.  I suppose we should be happy that the holiday is being upstaged, as it means we won’t have to suffer through a series of dimwitted congressional representatives misquoting and misunderstanding him. The flag in a time of distress Congratulations America! I am reliably informed that we are all now free to use the word “retard” and “pussy” at the office again… or something like that… those being major impediments to business if certain anonymous executives are to be believed.  I’d link to the source but it is behind the Financial Times paywall.  However, MAGA sites like Barstool Sports are eating it up and celebrating it like it is a huge win for America.  You can go Google that. I never cease to marvel at the ability of the typical MAGA to go from offended scold, whining about civility when they think they’ve insulted to performative edge lord looking deliberately to offend when they are talking about anybody else.  Being all huffy and demanding that we call him “President Trump” when you have a “Let’s Go Brandon” decal on your truck marks you as a whiny aggrieved hypocrite. But I am told that hypocrisy is the point. meant to reinforce the idea that rules and norms do not apply to them, that they can do whatever they want.  You, on the other hand, better respect the rules and norms or you’re a bad person. And certainly being upset that you can’t be abrasive at the office, that you can’t call a subordinate a “retard” or a “pussy” marks you out as somebody for whom civility is just a word in the dictionary, somebody for whom the motto might as well be “if you can’t punch down, don’t punch at all.” I mean, that was certainly one of the messages in last week’s post about Mark Zuckerberg, the winging man-child of Meta, who is sick of having to be nice to people so is going to encourage masculinity and free speech by declaring it open season minorities, immigrants, LGBTQ, and presumably “retards” and “pussies” I guess.  It can be hard to tell.  There isn’t anything like a consistent message.  It is mostly just noise. You might think that my opening with with this indicates that this is what I am really worried about those words, that civility is the main problem.  It was certainly easy to build up a head of steam to run ahead with that. But you would be wrong. Certainly it it is not NOT important, especially to anybody who ends up a victim of this shift in what is acceptable in what is essentially part of the ongoing MAGA war on civility.  But all of this is just a symptom of the larger whole, the era of chaos we are re-entering in full.  We’ve been in the chaos zone since 2015 when the idea of Trump as president, a reality TV star whose business acumen was such that he had to declare bankruptcy running a casino.  A casino!  A license to print money, and he screwed it up. See… it is tough to stay on point when there is just so much wrong.  But that is the plan.  Flood the zone with shit.  Constantly stir up a new crisis.  Don’t let anything sit undisturbed long enough for it to build into a real issue.  There will be a hundred things or more in the next week, some tailor made to stir your ire, and it will be too much for you to care about all of them.  I am already exhausted at just the preliminaries and it is only really kicking off today.  Remember that before you’re irked at somebody mad about something down your own personal list.  Dividing critics and getting them to bicker with each other… a ridiculously easy thing to do to the left… is all part of the plan.  Leave your purity tests at home and focus on the unifying issue of Trump. Trump is an unholy combo of shamelessness, ignorance, and greed.  He is at least four of the seven deadly sins in human form and might very well be confused for a construct of Satan himself given how easily he seems to be able to lead self-declared Christians away from the actual teachings of Christ… though that wasn’t hard at all.  That was really just the end product of decades of the rich spreading the message that if you need help that means you’re a bad person and should be ashamed and you’re probably destined for hell if you don’t just shut up.  Pretty much accepted as an aspect of the gospel in MAGA world. This means that there will now be non-stop political theater… not that it hasn’t already started.  All this talk about invading Panama, buying Greenland, and making Canada the 51st state… all bullshit.  Concerning, norms breaking bullshit… threatening two of our NATO allies with territorial annexation is more of a Putin thing… but still bullshit meant to focus attention on himself.  If you threaten to invade another country, people have to take you at least somewhat seriously, just in case.  And three other countries?  That gets an above the fold headline daily and at least one completely moronic Ross Douthat editorials I mean, just in case you thought I was kidding In the words of Oscar Wilde, the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about… and nobody believes that more than Trump. Once all the swearing and swearing in is over, the circus really begins in earnest.  ICE will be out raiding in big cities… not big cities in red states of course (maybe Dallas or Houston, but probably not) where all the anti-immigrant rhetoric masks the knowledge that their economies would fall apart if we actually deported the promised 10 million illegal immigrants… and it will be all done in front of cameras and there will be as much cruelty involved as they can managed.  Stephan Miller will be bragging about separating children from parents once again and people worried about civility will cheer cruelty. It will be bad for the people involved, the people being rounded up, detained, separated from their families, and locked up in some DHS limbo.  But it will also be a show, something to get people good and angry and focused on just that. At one point I had, for a brief moment, a twinge of sympathy for Steve Bannon in all of this, petty hobo grifter though he is.  He actually tried to stand up to the billionaires to demand that H1-B visas be curtailed as well, a source of cheap labor that does displace well paid jobs from US citizens.  It was almost charming when he and Laura Loomer piped up because they were sure we were supposed to be in on hating ALL immigrants, including the smart ones.  But Bannon didn’t kick in millions of dollars to the Trump campaign and didn’t write the one million dollar “I’m here for the grift party” check to the Trump inaugural fund so, at the risk of Godwin-ing myself, in this particular community theater production of the Night of the Long Knives, Bannon will be starring in the role as Ernst Rohm.  Who needs revolutionaries when the revolution has been achieved? Also, because I cannot resist, I do find it amusing that Trump has decided at the last minute to hold the inaugural indoors.  He has abandoned his supporters to the cold… a big middle finger to those working class followers who took the time to get there… so he can stay inside with all the billionaires.  That is the message about who matters and who doesn’t… and it isn’t you schmucks left out in the cold.  This has the added benefit of no embarrassing crowd measurements against Obama and Biden inaugurations.  Finally, it means he’ll be spending less of that inaugural fund so he can just stick any leftovers in his pocket.  The grift never stops. So it will be that and a host of executive orders raising hackles and getting people to protest while the clown show of his cabinet picks feed the fires of outrage.  I mean, you don’t think Trump picked Pete Hegseth to run the Department of Defense because you thought he would do a good job and be an effective leader, did you?  No way!  Pete was picked because he will elicit non-stop outrage to distract from the real goals of the administration.  The capabilities of the US armed forces have no bearing on what Trump really wants, which is money.  Outrage and chaos will serve to distract us.  Pete hanging up a “No Girls Allowed” sign on the doors of the Pentagon is all part of the plan. Trump will be focused on looting the US Treasury. First action out of the gate will to be to pay off the billionaires who supported his campaign with a big fat tax cut.  That will be in congress in the next week and will have universal Republican support… because they are all rich.  They don’t want to pay taxes on their insider trading… which distinguishes them from Democrats, who are at least willing to pay taxes on them I suppose. (I prefer politicians that feel some shame about their avarice rather than the ones that brag about how they’ve duped us.) Tax cuts for the rich.  That is the pillar of the Trump legislative agenda.  That will be followed by a gutting of any regulatory oversight and enforcement, so the rich will be able to do what they please, and it will be bad news for you if you’re in their way.  You will notice that the rich only get mad about pollution in their neighborhoods, not yours. And the billionaires will, in turn, do things to make sure Trump gets paid.  They’ll show their support by renting his properties, supporting his ventures, buying his new meme coin… I feel like it is a story from EVE Online when I have to ask “Is it normal to get scammed by the president of the United States?”  Rather than a straight up rug pull, this will be purely a vehicle to buy Trump’s attention… and doing whatever they need to in order to stay on his good side, where they payouts will be phenomenal.  My tax breaks bring all the billionaires to the yard, as one might say. Meanwhile, the idea that tariffs would replace this massive loss of revenue was always a non-starter.  Tariffs would need to be so high that inflation would go through the roof… because it is you and I that pay tariffs.  There will, of course, be a few highly publicized performative tariffs that will just happen to coincide with needs of his billionaire supporters.  Remember that when electric cars come up on the list for Elon.  Watch how every tariff magically aligns to the needs of a very rich US corporation… that coincidentally donated to the inaugural fund. After which corporate profits will hit all time highs.  It will be a billionaire windfall that will make the Wolf of Wall Street look like Pilgrim’s Progress.  The big question is who will be the first trillionaire out of this feeding frenzy?  Elon so desperately wants to get there he’d do anything… including devalue the dollar. The downside of all of this will take a year or two, but it will come.  The income of the US Government will dip dramatically and Pete will be up there saying that congress absolutely cannot cut the defense budget as it would impact the Brazilian Judo classes he made mandatory to increase masculinity in the armed forces.  And he’ll have a nice PowerPoint deck that will illustrate how both the average and median neck size of armed forces members have increased, a universally accepted measure of all things masculine according to Zuck and Joe. So it will be the so-called entitlements that will need cutting, which was the plan ALL ALONG.  It was out there for anybody to see if you gave a shit.  But “doing my own research” always means “falling back on my biases and preconceived notions.”  So now you’ll be paying the price…. well, we’ll be paying the price… I was kind of hoping Medicare would still be there when I retired, but medical care will be a province of the rich all the more so. I do love when the government takes your money then calls you entitled for wanting something for it.  Being lectured by some wanker congressman who gets a government pension after three terms that you paying into Social Security for 50 years doesn’t entitle you to anything and you’re greedy if you think it does is the… I want to say the full MAGA experience, but really this has always been republicans for all time. And those cuts, for there will have to be cuts, will impact the red states the most.  The irony here is that the states that voted for Trump are also in large part the states that are net recipients of US government payments.  Welfare goes to the mid-west as farm subsidies and south as straight up economic support and the money for it comes from blue states like California and New York.  Trump will interdict that so it flows to him and his billionaire supporters to the detriment of everything else. Enjoy your ability to say “retard” and “pussy” as that is all you’re getting… though I hear they might try to bring back the “n word” if you ask really nicely.   That would just be the cherry on top of all of this.  But immigrants, illegal or otherwise, will still be here doing the work we won’t at the bottom end and the work we want to get paid for at the H1-B visa end of the spectrum… at least until we make the place so unattractive they won’t want to come.  Trump is working on that. So get ready for some shitty state official telling you to stop complaining and be self-reliant like he is… on his taxpayer funded salary supplemented by graft for following the party line.  The rich love self-reliance in others because they don’t want to share their wealth. That is our future.  That is what you voted for.  That is what you’re going to get.  Sorry you got duped.  Sorrier still if you haven’t figured it out yet. And sorry to the rest of the world as well while we check out for the next decade or so, first to wreck ourselves in the name of corporate profits then, hopefully, to try and fix things.  But I cannot guarantee we’ll ever get to the “fix things” part.  Hope the Chinese are benign masters, as we won’t be lifting a finger to provide any sort of alternative.  We are actively seeking to become them so much so that I won’t even be mad when you drop the US Dollar as the default currency of international trade.  I’d like to think you’d go with the Euro, but it will probably be the Chinese Yuan.  Good luck.  Remember we once at least aspired to be a beacon of light in the world, even if we constantly fell short. That is my political post to mark the day.  Back to video games. TL;DR: If you didn’t kick in a million dollars to Trump’s inaugural fund, then you’re the mark in this scenario.",

because they were sure we were supposed to be in on hating ALL immigrants, including the smart ones.  But Bannon didn’t kick in millions of dollars to the Trump campaign and didn’t write the one million dollar “I’m here for the grift party” check to the Trump inaugural fund so, at the risk of Godwin-ing myself, in this particular community theater production of the \u003cem\u003eNight of the Long Knives\u003c/em\u003e, Bannon will be starring in the role as Ernst Rohm.  Who needs revolutionaries when the revolution has been achieved?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, because I cannot resist, I do find it amusing that Trump has decided at the last minute to hold the inaugural indoors.  He has abandoned his supporters to the cold… a big middle finger to those working class followers who took the time to get there… so he can stay inside with all the billionaires.  That is the message about who matters and who doesn’t… and it isn’t you schmucks left out in the cold.  This has the added benefit of no embarrassing crowd measurements against Obama and Biden inaugurations.  Finally, it means he’ll be spending less of that inaugural fund so he can just stick any leftovers in his pocket.  The grift never stops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it will be that and a host of executive orders raising hackles and getting people to protest while the clown show of his cabinet picks feed the fires of outrage.  I mean, you don’t think Trump picked Pete Hegseth to run the Department of Defense because you thought he would do a good job and be an effective leader, did you?  No way!  Pete was picked because he will elicit non-stop outrage to distract from the real goals of the administration.  The capabilities of the US armed forces have no bearing on what Trump really wants, which is money.  Outrage and chaos will serve to distract us.  Pete hanging up a “No Girls Allowed” sign on the doors of the Pentagon is all part of the plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump will be focused on looting the US Treasury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst action out of the gate will to be to pay off the billionaires who supported his campaign with a big fat tax cut.  That will be in congress in the next week and will have universal Republican support… because they are all rich.  They don’t want to pay taxes on their insider trading… which distinguishes them from Democrats, who are at least willing to pay taxes on them I suppose. (I prefer politicians that feel some shame about their avarice rather than the ones that brag about how they’ve duped us.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTax cuts for the rich.  That is the pillar of the Trump legislative agenda.  That will be followed by a gutting of any regulatory oversight and enforcement, so the rich will be able to do what they please, and it will be bad news for you if you’re in their way.  You will notice that the rich only get mad about pollution in their neighborhoods, not yours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the billionaires will, in turn, do things to make sure Trump gets paid.  They’ll show their support by renting his properties, supporting his ventures, buying his \u003ca href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/01/18/trump-meme-coin-25-billion\"\u003enew meme coin\u003c/a\u003e… I feel like it is a story from \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e when I have to ask “Is it normal to get scammed by the president of the United States?”  Rather than a straight up rug pull, this will be purely a vehicle to buy Trump’s attention… and doing whatever they need to in order to stay on his good side, where they payouts will be phenomenal.  My tax breaks bring all the billionaires to the yard, as one might say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the idea that tariffs would replace this massive loss of revenue was always a non-starter.  Tariffs would need to be so high that inflation would go through the roof… because it is you and I that pay tariffs.  There will, of course, be a few highly publicized performative tariffs that will just happen to coincide with needs of his billionaire supporters.  Remember that when electric cars come up on the list for Elon.  Watch how every tariff magically aligns to the needs of a very rich US corporation… that coincidentally donated to the inaugural fund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter which corporate profits will hit all time highs.  It will be a billionaire windfall that will make the \u003cem\u003eWolf of Wall Street\u003c/em\u003e look like \u003cem\u003ePilgrim’s Progress\u003c/em\u003e.  The big question is who will be the first trillionaire out of this feeding frenzy?  Elon so desperately wants to get there he’d do anything… including devalue the dollar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe downside of all of this will take a year or two, but it will come.  The income of the US Government will dip dramatically and Pete will be up there saying that congress absolutely cannot cut the defense budget as it would impact the Brazilian Judo classes he made mandatory to increase masculinity in the armed forces.  And he’ll have a nice PowerPoint deck that will illustrate how both the average and median neck size of armed forces members have increased, a universally accepted measure of all things masculine according to Zuck and Joe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it will be the so-called entitlements that will need cutting, which was the plan ALL ALONG.  It was out there for anybody to see if you gave a shit.  But “doing my own research” always means “falling back on my biases and preconceived notions.”  So now you’ll be paying the price…. well, we’ll be paying the price… I was kind of hoping Medicare would still be there when I retired, but medical care will be a province of the rich all the more so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do love when the government takes your money then calls you entitled for wanting something for it.  Being lectured by some wanker congressman who gets a government pension after three terms that you paying into Social Security for 50 years doesn’t entitle you to anything and you’re greedy if you think it does is the… I want to say the full MAGA experience, but really this has always been republicans for all time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd those cuts, for there will have to be cuts, will impact the red states the most.  The irony here is that the states that voted for Trump are also in large part the states that are net recipients of US government payments.  Welfare goes to the mid-west as farm subsidies and south as straight up economic support and the money for it comes from blue states like California and New York.  Trump will interdict that so it flows to him and his billionaire supporters to the detriment of everything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnjoy your ability to say “retard” and “pussy” as that is all you’re getting… though I hear they might try to bring back the “n word” if you ask really nicely.   That would just be the cherry on top of all of this.  But immigrants, illegal or otherwise, will still be here doing the work we won’t at the bottom end and the work we want to get paid for at the H1-B visa end of the spectrum… at least until we make the place so unattractive they won’t want to come.  Trump is working on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo get ready for some shitty state official telling you to stop complaining and be self-reliant like he is… on his taxpayer funded salary supplemented by graft for following the party line.  The rich love self-reliance in others because they don’t want to share their wealth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is our future.  That is what you voted for.  That is what you’re going to get.  Sorry you got duped.  Sorrier still if you haven’t figured it out yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd sorry to the rest of the world as well while we check out for the next decade or so, first to wreck ourselves in the name of corporate profits then, hopefully, to try and fix things.  But I cannot guarantee we’ll ever get to the “fix things” part.  Hope the Chinese are benign masters, as we won’t be lifting a finger to provide any sort of alternative.  We are actively seeking to become them so much so that I won’t even be mad when you drop the US Dollar as the default currency of international trade.  I’d like to think you’d go with the Euro, but it will probably be the Chinese Yuan.  Good luck.  Remember we once at least aspired to be a beacon of light in the world, even if we constantly fell short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is my political post to mark the day.  Back to video games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTL;DR: If you didn’t kick in a million dollars to Trump’s inaugural fund, then you’re the mark in this scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
