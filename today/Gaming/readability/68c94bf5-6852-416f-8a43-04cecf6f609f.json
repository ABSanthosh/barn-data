  "text": "Midnight Mansion sees you trying to solve murders in a former lab/escape room filled with boxes that are more dangerous than they seem. You’re Agent Milla Yang, and you’ve been sent to check on some strange deaths in this weird old house. Naturally, the perfect time to begin an investigation is in the middle of the night. Especially when you’re sent in by yourself. Your flashlight doesn’t give you much light to work with in this rickety old place, so you eyes feel like they can play tricks on you when you’re blundering around in the dark. As it turns out, your eyes are just fine. While there are a lot of boxes kicking around from the recent owner who just moved in, those boxes have frequently been occupied by some weird, spider-like creatures that are definitely the source of the deaths. Not every box holds one of these creatures, and not every spider gets up the first time you pass by. Since there’s boxes all over the place and you’re never entirely sure if one will get up to attack you, it is quite effective at keeping you on-edge as you explore. That and the fact that they tend to hop up when you’re very close or when they’re just out of sight. Midnight Mansion is a bite-sized Resident Evil experience, capturing some frightening surprises by simply hiding them in boxes that you never know you can trust. Filled with some neat, brief puzzles that can still have you scratching your head, a slew of unexpected near-death encounters, and limited ammo to fight back against the deadly monsters in the house, it’s solid horror fun for a little under an hour. Unless you keep getting killed like I did. I am not very good at noticing killer boxes by flashlight. Midnight Mansion is playable in your browser on itch.io.
