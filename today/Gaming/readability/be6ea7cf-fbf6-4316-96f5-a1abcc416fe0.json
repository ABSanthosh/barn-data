  "text": "Are you ready to rev it up and unleash your fury? SNK’s Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, the legendary ’90s fighter reborn, launches on April 24, 2025, for Xbox Series X|S. Eager to sink your teeth in early? The Open Beta kicks off tomorrow, running from February 20–24, giving you an early shot at the fight. Prepare to feast on next-gen brawling—powered by revolutionary game mechanics, a stunning comic-inspired art style, and flexible control options tailored for both newcomers and seasoned veterans. Wolves, start sharpening your claws and get ready to take on South Town’s greatest and latest! The Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves Open Beta invites the hungry pack to step into the ring and test out the integrated rollback netcode and cross-network play functionality with eight of the game’s characters to choose from. Players can battle it out with friends across three online modes in cross-network play: Ranked Match, Casual Match, and Room Match. Those who are new to Fatal Fury can learn the ropes in the offline Tutorial mode, which offers the perfect training ground. Debuting in City of the Wolves is the Rev System, a customizable toolset designed to supercharge offensive strategy from the very first clash. Only the strongest wolves can master (and balance) every Rev technique to reign as champion of South Town. Hit the books and study the Rev systems via our official Fighting Guide to learn more. On the topic of South Town, the Open Beta will give players access to some of the tropical city’s legends, including the Legendary Wolf himself, Terry Bogard, and the fan-favorite fiery ninja, Mai Shiranui. Terry is a jack-of-all-trades, equipped with a projectile, anti-air attacks, and rushdown moves to fight any opponent, near or far. His accessible arsenal of attacks makes him the perfect character to pick up for anyone new to the series, or fighting games in general. He’s not the poster boy of the series for nothing! Use your Power Charge and Crack Shoot to pressure the enemy while they are blocking and force them to overheat. Mai is also a well-rounded character with a variety of special moves. Her Sayo Chidori can put the opponent under pressure continuously, even when they are blocking. She’s also a great pick for players looking for more movement options, as mastering her Musasabi no Mai allows you to move around the stage with ease. Joining the roster are new challengers: Preecha, a diligent Muay Thai dynamo with calculated strikes, and the enigmatic Vox Reaper, whose demonic presence and deadly karate bring a fresh yet familiar intensity to the fight. Preecha’s playstyle focuses on relentless multi-hit attacks. She can try to go for cross-ups with her Hyperbolic Kick or open up her opponent with a Rev Preecha’s Combination followed by a Circular Step. Vox has long-range normals to check his opponents, including a standing heavy punch that can be followed up with his Kokuen Ryuu shockwave (and other moves) to deal seriously big damage. He even has a command grab to keep his opponent guessing at midrange. Rounding out the Open Beta roster are a mix of returning legends and fresh faces ready to join the fray: Rock Howard, Terry Bogard’s protégé and son of South Town’s infamous Geese Howard, carries a complex legacy. Rock has a well-balanced lineup of special moves, including projectiles that travel along the ground, anti-airs, and attacks with forward momentum. His Shippuu Ken works well against grounded opponents to keep them at bay, while the mighty command grab Shinkuu Nage can be used with Rev Accel as a strong combo starter. Hotaru Futaba, easygoing but powerful, brings grace and discipline to the fight. She’s a speedy character who uses a variety of attacks to mess with her opponent and keep them at her mercy. Her forward step is a full-fledged run, allowing her to use her projectiles as a shield and close in on her opponent simultaneously. She also has a midair stomp (Koushuu Da) and a quick command grab (Shajou Tai) to help break through the opponent’s defenses even more. B. Jenet, daring leader of the Lilien Knights, commands attention with her fearlessness. She’s a technical character whose spiraling Afterburner attack descends from the air and leads well into combos on hit. Gulf Tomahawk is another useful move that can be stopped midway through via the Braking mechanic, allowing her to follow up with a jump attack or her Harrier Bee. She has a number of ways to approach her opponent, making her a dynamic character on the ground or in the air. Lastly, the highly ambitious Kain R. Heinlein, who aims to seize control of South Town—not for power or wealth, but his own ideals of true freedom. Kain is a methodical character who fights at mid-to-long range using his powerful projectiles and setups. His formidable Schwarze Lanze allows him to find gaps in hard-hitting enemy offense; it requires a charge motion, though, making him a more difficult fighter to master (albeit a highly defensive one adept at keeping himself out of harm’s way). Make the most of these and other moves in Kain’s toolkit to control the pace of every fight! A diverse pack of wolves—with more to come in the full game—are raring for battle. The streets of South Town are a hotbed of action, wild dreams, and even wilder ambition. Here, at long last, a new legend is about to unfold… Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is perfect for both new and experienced players, providing two control schemes tailored to all levels of experience: Arcade Style and Smart Style. Arcade Style offers traditional fighting game controls, while Smart Style streamlines gameplay, allowing flashy special moves and combos with simple directional inputs and single-button presses. Making its triumphant return after 26 years, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves aims to wow old and new fans with its dynamic art style, a mix of new and familiar fighters, and modernized battle systems. Read more on how to play on our official website. Pre-orders for the Special Edition of Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves are now live for $59.99 USD / €59.99 EUR, featuring the Base Game and Season Pass 1. Players who pre-order will unlock a classic Terry Bogard costume inspired by his original Fatal Fury appearance, along with three days of early access to the full game, starting April 21, 2025. Get ready for the Open Beta and gear up for the full launch on April 24, 2025, on Xbox Series X|S. In the meantime, check out Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves and the KOF Studio on X, Instagram, and the official Discord. After 26 years, FATAL FURY is back! SNK’s beloved Fatal Fury series first hit the market in 1991, spearheading the fighting game boom of the 1990s that swept the industry thereafter. GAROU: MARK OF THE WOLVES (released in 1999) has, for some time, served as the franchise’s most recent installment. But that is all about to change: 26 years on, a brand-new entry—FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves—is set to arrive on the scene! FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves features a unique art style that stimulates the senses, an innovative REV system that supercharges the excitement, plus a host of other battle systems even more robust than before. The game also breathes new life into the series by introducing two distinct control schemes (ensuring fun and excitement for newcomers and veterans alike) as well as other fresh features and elements.
