  "text": "Building a bridge to your heart. Image credit: Kojima Productions Kojima Productions really is determined to make sure we don't forget Death Stranding 2 is almost upon us. Alongside a musical world tour, a themed PlayStation 5 controller, plus all that chatter about a Death Stranding movie and anime, the studio has now confirmed it'll be streaming a Death Stranding 2 panel event next month. Officially known as the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Game Premiere event, it's the first date in Kojima Productions' previously announced months-long \"world tour\" that careens through the likes of Sydney, Paris, London, and Hong Kong before ending in Lucca this November. Things get underway, however, at 7pm PDT on Sunday, 8th June in Los Angeles, California - and keen-eyed observers will immediately appreciate that ties is neatly with the start of Summer Game Fest season. And thus enter Geoff Keighley, who'll be hosting the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Game Premiere event at Los Angeles' Orpheum Theatre, with best pal and Death Standing creator Hideo Kojima in attendance too. DEATH STRANDING 2: ON THE BEACH | Pre-Order Trailer Here's a trailer for Death Stranding 2.Watch on YouTube The focus of the event is a panel discussion featuring Kojima and unspecified \"special guests\", but there's also talk of a live demonstration of Death Stranding 2, should you wish to get another peek ahead of its 26th June release on PlayStation 5. And if you do, you can either show up in person - tickets are available online - or, probably more conveniently for most, watch the whole thing on YouTube. Just be aware that it doesn't start till 3am on 9th June in the UK, so you might prefer to catch up later once you've had your beauty sleep. So there's a lot happening in the world of Death Stranding, then, but will the wait be worth it? Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale nipped across the ocean to have a look a few months back and came away with many thoughts. Perhaps the most telling words, however, are these: \"So far, [Death Stranding 2] feels like the most Kojima-game yet\".",
