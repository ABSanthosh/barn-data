Wait, weren’t we supposed to have a big finish, to have an end at some point? No, of course not!  Because capitalism demands you ride or die on your ability to earn money.  So on we go into the game’s eighteenth anniversary party, because the game survives so long as the party keeps going!  We’re not going to scourge the Shire any time soon and we’ll probably never get to the Grey Havens.  This isn’t Tolkien, this is Moll Flanders… at least the bit before the money runs out and the whole indentured servitude things picks up.  With Mordor having fallen, we’ll live in an ongoing denouement so long as the money lasts. Happy 18th Anniversary! That nit picked, it really is time again for an anniversary and 18 is getting into some serious numbers. So what are we getting for the anniversary?  Well, there are the “being there” rewards for just logging in, which are as follows: 18th Anniversary Log In Reward! For players who have acquired the 17th Anniversary Giftbox, the 18th Anniversary Giftbox has arrived! Starts at 10:00 AM Eastern (-4 GMT) on April 24th and continues until 3:00 AM Eastern (-4 GMT) on April 1st, 2026! Free Peoples of Middle-earth (Premium and VIP): 18-Year Giftbox: Baker’s Delight Fireworks Eighteen-Year Frame Title: , Luck-maker Monster Players (Premium and VIP): 17-Year Giftbox: Luck-stealer Fireworks Eighteen-Year Frame +5% Attack Damage x5 – consumable Title: , Luck-stealer All players will receive an Anniversary Gift Box corresponding to the prior year received when they log in during this time. This is one of those things where I think they could have made this more confusing, but they would have had to put in some effort.  If you log in you get the gift box, and maybe it will be the 18 year box… I guess.  I mean, I got the 18 year gift box. Another item in my inventory I also go the Free Peoples title. Add it to my growing list But the implication is that maybe you won’t. Meanwhile, for those who want more out of this, there is also the Anniversary Festival event.  That kicks off today at several locations: The Party Tree in The Shire, located at [29.9S, 71.5W] near Hobbiton. Bree, located at [31.1S, 51.2W], in the city and on the edge of it near the West Gate. The Festival Arena in the basement of Thorin’s Hall, located at [13.8S, 103.3W]. The Methel-stage in The Shire, located at [32.6S, 69.9W]. The Horse Races in the Bree-fields near the Festival Grounds [24.9S, 52.0W] and the Delving Fields in The Shire [36.3S, 73.2W] The recommendation is to start at the Party Tree and work from there.  Waldo Rumble will get you started.  Don’t worry, he’ll send you an email. Message from Waldo The time stamp on letters seems to be a bit off.  Or maybe that is the expiration date. It is probably the latter.  The send time is visible when you open the message, but it is typical LOTRO UI to leave me wondering what it meant.  Also my message from Elrond is gone. Anyway, it has been a few years since I ran through any of the festivals and have pretty strictly avoided events on this run through the game.  They may, in fact, help you advance, they can also distract from the goal at hand… which in this case involves cleaning up people’s crap in Dunland.  Dungland more like it.  But I’ll get to that in a bit. First I may reflect a bit on my own time in Middle-earth over the last dozen and a half years. Related: SSG – Happy 18th Anniversary!
