The choice of the Rifter, one of the most iconic hulls in the game, hearkens back to the beginning days of Goons in New Eden and some of their early propaganda where they cast themselves as the outsiders who, lacking in skill and sophistication, would settle for choking the enemy’s guns by throwing a mass of cheap ships at their foes. Once it was just Rifters… Getting people to mostly stick to Rifters… well, that was nothing short of a miracle, even if a Rifter was supposed to me safe passage to the event.  Rifters were also handed out to those who wanted them. The whole thing was reported to be a tidi nightmare.  I certainly didn’t miss that part, though I would have put up with it to be a part of the event. The kill mail over on zKillboard shows 3,804 pilots manage to get recorded on the kill.  Once the Keepstar exploded, GSF FC Apple Pear flew out in a smart bombing Megathron for those who didn’t want to walk home, collecting nearly 1,400 kills.  If your pod gets blown up you respawn back at your home station, which some days if worth the loss. There were a number of posts over on Reddit and some videos posted, such as this two minute sped up version of the nearly three hour process. CCP also put out a video from The Scope, the in-game news service, that covered the event as well. There is some good background on the whole thing in the video, even if CCP insists on referring to the 2020 conflict as “World War Bee 2,” as they don’t like the idea that the 2016 war was the “Casino War” for many of us.  It reflects badly on them that they allowed casinos in the first place and subsequently shut them all down soon after the war. As I noted in last week’s post about the event, the 1DQ1-A Keepstar was our home for eight years, so we couldn’t let just anybody wander by and blow it up.  We had to send it off in style.  There was no word on how the asset safety transfer went, but I am sure there will be a lot of stuff waiting for lapsed players in Irmalin, the asset safety destination, when the 30 day timer finishes. While I did not make it to the event, I did go out to see the monument that CCP put down where the Keepstar had been, slipping out in an Anathema covert ops ship.  The monument was visible from the T5ZI-S gate. Cloaked up, my first sight of the monument There isn’t much written at the beacon currently. Information about the monument It is also the same model that CCP used for the TTC Keepstar Monument in Perimeter, but it would be a bit much to expect them not to reuse that. The Innominate Palace Keepstar Monument So it goes.  Another marker in space related to the player driven nature of EVE Online in general and null sec space in particular.
