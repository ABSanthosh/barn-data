There was a brief moment of balance achieved back around 2007, where the PvP shone brightly for a few months… but only if you kept below level 20 and only in specific zones and it had a host of other issues largely caused by the game classes, which were designed for PvE raiding, being used against other players who lacked the health pools, resists, or other special mechanics of raid bosses. This wasted effort hit low ebb for me when the team went and redid every combat skill in the game to give each a PvE and a PvP attack.  There went hundreds of hours of effort down the drain as PvP stayed dead, killed by the contradictions of the design… hours that could have been used to work on things the core game audience would have liked as opposed to chasing the illusory PvP audience. So PvP died back in 2016. But the fact that it was good for about 15 minutes back during the second Bush administration has meant that SOE, then Daybreak, have invested a bunch of effort in trying to recreate that moment. PvP was revived in 2019 with the Nagafen server, then in 2021 with the Tarinax server, then again in 2023 with the Zarrakon server, and now it is making another return with the Dozekar server.  This time for sure! Welcome to Dozekar – Please Drive Through! Named for Dozekar the Cursed, rumored parent of Kerafyrm “the sleeper,” this time around the server is based on the origins platform that came in with last year’s Anashti Sul server and is setup to better simulate the way things were back in 2006 than the standard platform. So that, but now with PvP. I guess I should cut the team a break.  One of the lessons of the EverQuest annual special server thing is that you can’t just run a vanilla retro server every year, and at least one could suggest that, in the context of Norrath, PvP might be an under served customer base. And the Dozekar name is on point, as old Dozy is a dragon whose curse, laid on it for some ancient error in judgement it is to be slain and revived over and over again… like some noob on a PvP server.  You think I am kidding?  From the intro: This lore is very fitting for our Origins PvP Server, as there will be endless deaths and rebirths to endure along your journey. Do you have what it takes to break the curse and remain among the living? Go forth and make your mark in this world, adventurer! So, as with Anashti Sul last year, the Dozekar server will launch with just the base game as it was… mostly… back in 2006 and then unlock from there.  Also, they are totally playing up the “2006 PvP was the shit!” story, in case you thought I was kidding above. Unlike 2004 or 2006, the server will be restricting how far you can level up, no doubt to try and keep the pack of players that show up together.  So at launch, which was last week, so I am a bit behind on this, you were capped out at level 22.  Is that just before rogue classes get their recall to zone line skill?  Anyway, this is how things will unlock. Level 22: 06/10/25 Level 32: 06/24/25 Level 42: 07/08/25 Level 50: 07/22/25 The pace isn’t that slow… though I certainly didn’t level up that fast back in 2004… or 2006.  But everything happens at double speed on a retro server. Content after the base experience is tentatively planned as: Unlock Bloodline Chronicles: 08/12/25 Unlock Splitpaw Saga: 09/09/25 Unlock Desert of Flames: 10/14/25 The last is the first game expansion and will boost the level cap to 60.  I suspect there isn’t a published plan beyond that because past special PvP servers have tended to fall apart, shedding players and fun, much beyond the sweet spot of the early times.  There will be a group of players who will turn off their xp in the early 20s and get themselves twinked out and then spend time ganking noobs until the suckers stop showing up. I have seen this all happen before, and I am sure we’ll see it happen again.  But it likely will be fun for some number of players for a brief period this summer. As with the Anashti Sul server, to play on Dozekar you will need to select the Origins version of the game by clicking on the version in the upper left of the launcher. Origins Server Launcher Setting Being on the Origins platform means that it will share some commonality with Anashti Sul. There will be no spell research. Krono will not be able to be consumed, traded, or sold on an Origins server. Attributes have restored secondary functionality, agility will help avoid melee attacks, intelligence will increase ability potency, strength will increase melee damage, and wisdom will grant extra resistance. All bosses will be original stat/buff packages. No weight. It could not be restored. No holiday events. There will be a marketplace, but it will be very limited. It will not be free trade. This server shares the design depot for PVE Origins. Freeport and Qeynos are back to old school, in both appearance and functionality. No persistent instances. No tradeskill subcombines. Anashti Sul and Dozekar will share a player character limit. Of course, you must be an All Access subscriber to play on this server.  Special servers cost special dollars.  And maybe there are enough people who will dive in for a couple of months to make these sorts of servers a financial success.  That they don’t seem to last long is just a thing. So there it is.  If this is what you have been waiting for you can ignore my less than glorious history lesson up at the top of the post and dive right in.  Otherwise, I guess we’ll see if we continue the pattern and get another PvP server in 2027.
