Check out my twitter for constant updates and share your thoughts via email at [email protected] Features: - skill based gameplay - no auto fight mechanics - hardcore permadeath mode for roguelike fans - procedurally generated dungeons - gamepad support Genre:Action, Role Playing TouchArcade Rating:Unrated Compatibility:HD Universal Isn’t there already a thread for this right below this one? Yeah, someone else made it. I think it's better if it's created by the actual author of the game? I had covid, so I didn't really have the energy to do it right at the exact minute I released the game Hopefully the admin can remove that other one. Edit needs a day off ... Reposting in the new thread: I understand that you out “thousands of hours” into this but $27.99 for a new camera angle is ridiculous, even if it comes with some character classes and item storage. I was looking forward to playing this first person, but sheesh. houseofg Well-Known Member Patreon Bronze Then don't buy that IAP..? You're dismissive of what is included (for $19.99 it looks like), so who cares what the price is? He's made a game that you can fully play without paying a single dime or watching a single ad, so I don't understand the clutched pearls here. The most meaningful (but still unnecessary) IAP is at $4.99, to unlock all specializations (that you can otherwise unlock in game) and get free respecs. Camera angles were added only to reward people who donated to the game before the donations gave anything. Believe it or not, but some people actually donated 40$ to the game while getting completely nothing in return. I've added camera angles (and all the other rewards) just as a fun addition to reward such people. I would have never added such a random feature if that wasn't the case, it's completely unnecessary for the main gameplay of an arpg If you don't like isometric games and just prefer to play fpp games then I guess my game is just not for you, the fpp mode is just a funny addition and is not designed to be the main way to play the game (although I know that some people actually do play in fpp, which is pretty awesome). That's why I'm not promoting the game as a FPP game. All of the store screenshots are from the default camera view. I totally understand you may not want to pay 20$ for some random mobile game, it's totally your choice Btw is it really $27.99? That seems super weird, that's like 40% of added tax. I guess I need to take a look at how taxes work on ios :dThanks for backing me up, I appreciate it! Been playing this game and having a lot of fun! Excited to see how the story mode is, as just the dungeon crawling is fun. houseofg Well-Known Member Patreon Bronze Definitely agree. I was just looking for something to scratch my looter crawler itch a couple days ago, and this is doing just fine! I can see spending a lot of time on this and story mode will indeed be icing on the cake whenever that comes. I will definitely be buying IAP to support this. In that regard, @Bart Mamzer, is IAP iterative? I'm pondering the $5 or $10 level but, down the road, if I good and truly get into this I may indeed want to try out that alternative camera angle! Also, bug report (couldn't find where to submit in game): On my iPhone 12 Pro, the X in the upper right to back out to the main menu is only barely showing in that corner. Enough it is missing that I can't register pressing it at all, so I have to dump out of the game and restart to get back to it. Im really not that invested in this, but literally the first image you posted here is in first-person with no mention of it being a $27.99 unlock lol (I’m in Canada so the prices are higher). I love isometric dungeon crawlers so I’m going to give it a shot - I was just trying to give some feedback on how crazy the reward tiers are. Thanks for the feedback! I hope you enjoy the game I'm glad you like it! The story mode is still far away unfortunately, but hopefully it's going to be fun! If you're asking about a discount for higher tiers when you buy lower tiers then yes, that's how it works. If you buy the first one then the rest gets discounted by 5$, etc. Thanks for the bug report, but I'm not entirely sure what you're talking about. I tried using the iphone 12 pro resolution and it seems fine for me. Would you be so kind and make a screenshot of the place where you see the problem? (you can use discord, email ([email protected]) or just pm me here). houseofg Well-Known Member Patreon Bronze Yes, that's exactly what I meant - great to hear! Emailed you a screenshot. EDIT: I caught this before I sent the screenshot but still sent an email explaining that it's a part of a ^ (info roll-up button) I can only see in the upper right corner. I was just assuming it was an X because I couldn't see all of it until (for some reason) I could in the screenshot. Weird. As long as the IAP are one time unlocks and not gatcha or in game currency, I’m in!!! I love supporting indie developers but I also love premium games with no iap, seems like this is one I can stomach though, looks fantastic a good dungeon crawler is my Achilles heel Thanks for the clarification! Very, very, very impressive especially for a one man game. Since Powerlust has been on Android for a while (2, 3 years, 4,5 out if 5 stars with over 4000 reviews) and the dev is incredibly active a lot of work, fixes and updates have been put into this already. That it is completely free with only a few optional, cosmetic \"donation iAPs\" is definitely the icing on the cake and as prolific as Bart has obviously been over the years (the game is clearly a work of much passion) I‘m very optimistic that we‘ll see story mode one of these days. Even if this day seems to be a while away I‘m looking very much forward to it. Just to be clear, I only have put in an hour or so so far meaning I can‘t speak to how much I’ll stay invested in the long term. But so far I likes what I see … A lot Sorry, accidential double post Share This Page",
