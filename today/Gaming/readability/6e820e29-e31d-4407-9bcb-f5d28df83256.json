  "text": "Follows backlash at launch. Image credit: FromSoftware Elden Ring Nightreign will receive another patch next week to make improvements for solo players. FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off has already received a day one patch that brought balance adjustments. And there's more to come. Next week, patch 1.02 will be released, adding an automatic revival effect once per Nightlord battle for solo expeditions. Further, the amount of runes acquired will be increased. Elden Ring Nightreign For Dummies: Basics For EVERYTHING You Need to Know (But Were Afraid to Ask) Elden Ring Nightreign For Dummies: Basics For EVERYTHING You Need to Know (But Were Afraid to Ask)Watch on YouTube Nightreign released earlier today and has already seen strong numbers of concurrent players on Steam, although it's received a Mixed reception due to players criticising the lack of duo option and in-game communication features. Indeed, many players have criticised the studio - known for its single-player games - for creating a multiplayer game, although solo play is an option. The following improvements for solo expeditions will be added to the game:- The effect \"Automatic Revival Upon Defeat\", which allows revival once per night boss battle, will be added to solo expeditions.- The amount of runes gained will be increased.Thank you for your support.— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) May 30, 2025 As I wrote earlier today, I would not recommend Nightreign as a solo game at this point as it's clearly not the intended way to play. However, it seems FromSoftware is aiming to respond to the current backlash to make solo play more feasible. The studio previously stated it was considering a two-player option post-launch, acknowledging it was \"something that was overlooked during development\". \"FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour,\" I wrote in our Elden Ring Nightreign review.",
