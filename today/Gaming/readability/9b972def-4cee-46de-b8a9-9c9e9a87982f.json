  "text": "ParaNormal Activities aims to help a ghost keep everything peaceful by snuffing out hauntings before nosy people can take pictures of them. Grace would just like to have a little peace and quiet in her haunted mansion out in the woods, but these pesky ghost hunters just aren’t having it. Too many nights of spooky shows and supernatural videos have them meandering through your home, and they are DEFINITELY going to find something if you can’t calm down all the various unnatural events that continually happen throughout the mansion. If you don’t want an endless parade of phantom fanatics, ghoul chasers, and spooky podcasters roaming through here, you’ll need to calm this place down fast. As Grace the ghost, you can freely move throughout the building. Since you’re a ghost, you can pass through walls, too, so (in theory) you can quickly reach whatever you’re trying to reach. You’ll be given small indicators of where haunted objects are acting up throughout the house (and you can usually hear them chattering away, too). You need to make a beeline for those objects and then hover over them to defuse the haunting before the ghost hunters find them and photograph them. The kicker is that, as a ghost, your touch can activate the supernatural energies in dormant objects. Anything you touch will start acting up, so you have to be careful about the route you take or you’ll cause more trouble than you eliminate. You can use this as a distraction, but I’m far more prone to giving myself a handful of future headaches instead. ParaNormal Activities is a cute, playful horror game that got surprisingly frantic the more I accidentally caused hauntings while trying to stop other ones. Flipping the horror genre on its head using a ghost’s abilities is a neat idea that made for a fun little experience. ParaNormal Activities is available now (for free) on itch.io.
