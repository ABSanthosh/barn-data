    "description": "I realize, after 18 years as a part of it, that the rules of the food internet in the week before the American cooking superbowl we call Thanksgiving dictate that everything should relate back to turkey, stuffing, or pie. But friends, we have that abundantly covered in the archives, and the newsletter. So let me tell you what I’ve been making a lot lately to feed myself what I crave, and that is sheet pans of mixed vegetables roasted until almost charred, finished with a balsamic vinaigrette, and studded with heavenly, salty, crispy pillows of halloumi.

    "description": "I hadn’t planned to spend most of the fall to date making skillets upon skillets of baked, gooey, decadent macaroni and cheese, though given the state of things right now, perhaps this steady dose of comfort food was some unintended brilliance on my part. But mostly it started because we had baked mac and cheese from The Smith one night. My kids fought over the last scrapings from the pan and I reminded them — I honestly don’t even think they realize it sometimes — that I could make it for them, too. And so the next night, I pulled up my trusty Martha’s mac-and-cheese, a forever SK and internet favorite, and it immediately …irked me. Start with cooked pasta? Warm the milk for the bechamel? So many pans, so many bowls, so many steps. On a Tuesday, no less. It felt unacceptable. Read more »",

From Our Shop Titanium Nonstick Always Pan Pro $150–$195 More Colors Shop Titanium Nonstick Always Pan Pro Now Starting today, we will be moving away from PFAS-based chemically coated nonstick cookware and bakeware. It’s become abundantly clear through scientific research that many coated nonstick cookware and bakeware contains harmful forever chemicals (PFAS) that can contaminate the foods we eat. With regular use, these coatings are also known to lose their nonstick qualities, which leads to a constant cycle of disappointment and consumption. While these coatings are regulated in other countries, and some American states are beginning to institute better oversight, we’ve chosen to take action as an independent retailer. “We are proud to make this change as part of our ongoing commitment to transparency around the products we sell,” says Jojo Feld, GM of Food52. “Phasing out nonstick cookware and bakeware that contain forever chemicals is an important part of that.” Read More \u003e\u003e",

    "description": "This weekend, Gladiator II—Ridley Scott’s sequel to his Russell Crowe-led masterpiece—hits theaters. The $300 million production will feature a chuckling Denzel Washington, CGI rhinos, jacked Paul Mescal, some red wine (praying its a hyper-local, biodynamic Italian red), and, likely, a few bowls of vegetarian stew. Per historians—and Scott’s original film—plant-based stews, soups, and “mashes” were gladiators’ primary source of fuel. Typically consisting of barley and beans, these vegetarian concoctions allowed fighters to “carbo-load” (like marathon runners) before their life-altering bouts in the Colosseum. Research—but not Hollywood—also suggests that gladiators’ diets offered another benefit: fat. According to the Archaeological Institute of America, these stews were designed to create “a fat cushion” that would protect fighters from “cut wounds” while “shield[ing] nerves and blood vessels” during combat.

    "description": "She told me about what she thinks about her body; that people at her table are talking about getting married. She listens to my feedback about her effort at soccer practice and asks me to speak in a more calm voice (I wasn’t yelling for the record, but I do get passionate when I want to make a point. That point being: please act like you want to be there). He wants me to listen to the fart joke in his audio book or the techno song that he likes, even though it “feels stressful” (it does). He tears up over feeling like everyone at school just argues over football rules everyday and remarks he wants to live with us forever. I get so much from them at bed time, like everyone is ready to unload, and maybe this is a season, and one I’ll miss if it is, but when did they become people? Messy ones who still need to be reminded to put their clothes away 385798410 times, but these complicated feelings over friendship and motivation and little and big questions are pretty remarkable. I am planning some travel for a few book events, and it struck me how much I really love the ages of our kids. It’s so much easier now - they’re more flexible to take along, their thoughts are interesting and funny. I’d want to be both of their friends if I got to go back to elementary school. Curran is turning 10, I’m turning 40, a book that feels like it took forever to make it finally coming out this Spring and in a good way, it feels more like New Years than January did. At a glance, zooming out, asking questions and reorienting perspective. Here we are, and isn’t that just amazing.All those memes about how people hate that bloggers write musings instead of just post recipes. It’s not always for you, dearest recipe searcher, sometimes the writing is just as much the connection as the food is, so you’re going to have to bear with me. Many people I know who connect through making people food, are also writers and thinkers and communicators, so it’s a package deal, folks. It’s pillow talk and pasta over here. Speaking of the cookbook! Most every recipe in there has a photo except for, maybe 4? There are factors that contribute like page count and price etc. so a few final shots just didn’t make it in. Unfortunately, no photo usually means less intrigue and the recipe can get overlooked, so I’m going to highlight one of my favorites here. I love pasta with lots of bits in it and this one is heavy on the bits. My kids will eat this, picking around the extra kale and Cleo won’t actually like it, but they eat it. Either way, I do think you should put this one on your list soon.I also wanted to post a few dates for some cookbook events coming up around the time of publishing. If you live in any of these areas, I would really love to meet you! If more get added, I will include them here as a landing page.

You may end up with more kale pesto than you need for this recipe, but it has lots of other uses, such as with eggs, atop roast potatoes, or as a veggie sandwich spread. We don’t want the fresh sausage-like chorizo in tube form; instead, look for a dry chorizo, typically from Spain, not Mexico, that you will find in a well stocked cheese and deli section. It looks like salami. I do think sucessful dinner prep takes a bit of planning. The pesto can be made a few days in advance to save time. Vegetarian? Replace the chorizo with some chopped, sun dried tomatoes. Printed from Around Our Table by Sara ForteFOR THE WINTER PESTO2 cloves garlic1/4 cup pine nuts2 Tbsp. lemon juice1 cup cilantro or parsley1 packed cup lacinato kale, deribbed and chopped1 tsp. sea salt1/2 tsp. fresh ground pepper1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil1/4 cup grated parmesan cheeseFOR THE CAULIFLOWER1 head cauliflower, broken into small florets3 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil1 tsp. dried oreganosea salt and fresh ground pepper2 oz. dried chorizo, cut in 1” ribbons1 small bundle lacinato kale, deribbed and cut in ribbons12 oz. any short pastahalf of one lemongrated parmesan, red pepper flakes, fresh parsley, for garnishMake the kale pesto. In a food processor, pulse the garlic, pine nuts and lemon juice together. Add the cilantro and/or parsley, chopped kale, salt and pepper, and run it again until well chopped. With the motor going, drizzle in the olive oil and parmesan cheese. Set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Preheat the oven to 425’. On a rimmed baking sheet, pile the cauliflower, and drizzle it with the olive oil, oregano, salt and pepper. Toss well to coat and roast for 30 minutes until the edges are toasty. To the baking sheet, add the chorizo and kale ribbons, toss everything to coat. If the sheet looks dry, add another drizzle of oil. Roast an additional 3 minutes to warm. Set aside.Cook your pasta according to instructions. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water. Drain the pasta and put it back in the pot with a few heaping spoonfuls of the pesto and a giant splash of the pasta water. Stir to mix, we want it generously sauced. Add the contents of the baking sheet, squeeze of fresh lemon and stir again. Add more pesto if you’d like or more pasta water to loosen things up. Serve portions with a generous sprinkling of parmesan, red pepper flakes, a grind of pepper and some fresh parsley.",

    "description": "I always buy a bundle of bananas at the market, only 1 of 4 of us actually snacks on a banana, which leaves lots of moments of overripe bananas that are too ripe for snacking but perfect for baking. 4 of 4 like the baked goods with the bananas. You’re welcome for my elementary math equation proving it is in fact, worth buying the bananas. These are my favorite sorts of treats to make for and with the kids. Everything mashes up in one bowl, they’re easy on the sugar, packs in a lunchbox and they are free of the glutens and dairy so any person that comes over with a dietary preference, has a snack. I know when we’ve made them a dozen times, they are worth sharing here, so hope you have bananas ready to go soon (extra extra brown! don’t bother if they are pretty and yellow!). xoAFTER SCHOOL BANANA CHOCOLATE CHIP CHUNKERSMakes 12Gluten free, dairy free and honestly, you can skip the egg if you need to and I believe they’ll still hold. I’ve been making these when I have dead bananas, but banana bread feels like too much. A tray of these will be gone before the end of the day and they hold up in a lunch box too. Nut allergy folks, all-purpose flour is fine. Replace the almond and coconut flours with 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour. They will look different than what is pictured. The flax does help absorb some extra moisture, and you can pick that up and nearly any supermarket these days.

Add in the egg, oil or butter, sugar, vanilla , cinnamon, salt and whisk everything together to mix. Add the almond flour, oats, flax, coconut flour, baking powder and stir again to combine. Fold in the chocolate chips. Chill the mixture for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 360’ and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. I make ours free-formed, not perfect balls 1) because they are tough to get into a ball and 2) I like those craggle edges! We want about 2-3 Tbsp. sized lumps, arranged with 2” of space between (they don’t spread much). Bake on the middle rack for 12-15 minutes until toasty on the edges, but still tender in the center. Remove to cool. Keep the cookies in a covered container at room temperature for up for 3 days, and in the fridge any longer than that.

    "description": "Shutterbean Thanksgiving Meal Prep: Thanksgiving is next week. Are you ready for it? Are you wondering what can you do ahead of time to prep for Thanksgiving? I’ll tell you! You must: MAKE LISTS \u0026 GO OVER YOUR CALENDAR. MAP IT OUT. Collect your recipes, and organize!  Figure out what you can do ahead of time and DO IT so your day of is less stressful.  First, you need to answer the following questions: Now you need to organize the answers!! My Party Prep List will help.  Start with a pencil and go over in pen!  There’s also a lot going on during the week of a holiday, so it’s important to map out all the other days surrounding the holiday.  Here’s my weekly planner template if you need help. Hang it up on the fridge, so everyone knows the agenda! If you’re hosting other people for the week, you’ll need to plan meals in addition to the main event. Map it out! What can you do to make life easier?  Here’s my dinner template that you can also put on your fridge.    A clipboard can keep you organized. It will be your home base. It’s helpful if you get a clipboard with a folder storage situation because you can organize your recipes that way! Carry it around the house and pretend you are a cruise director/camp counselor. Clipboards command respect. Also, they don’t get lost as easily as rogue papers.  I find it helpful to draw out the things I’m making. Sometimes it’s easier to see what you need to put on the table when you mapped out a visual for yourself.  You can also draw the dish you’re serving it in. You don’t need to be a pro, just map it out!    Find ways to make life easier for yourself.   Many years ago, I started making Mark Bittman’s Braised Turkey and there’s no going back! In this recipe, I can prep all of the ingredients the day ahead (including disassembling the turkey) which means I have less cutting of the turkey the day of. Plus this recipe gives the most amazing gravy base.    Speaking of… let’s talk more about what can be prepped ahead of time.  If you’re hosting here’s a list of things you can do ahead of time Grocery shop/pick up things that are premade  Set the table (place cards or no?) Arrange flowers/decor for table Gather the dishes you plan to use for serving. Set up a buffet ahead of time to space things out. Put out trivets or any hot pads on the table where needed.  Clean house/prep for guests (deep clean bathrooms!)
