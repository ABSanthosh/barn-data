    "description": "What if I told you I had a from-scratch cinnamon roll recipe that was effortlessly veganized, required no kneading, and could be coming out of your oven in just over two hours? And what if I told you’d I’d been making it for years and didn’t tell you about it because I thought, for some bizarre reason, that the site didn’t need another breakfast bun recipe? Yes, I’d throw a jar of cinnamon at my head too. Good news, though, you can stop yelling now because I’ve come to my senses. Read more »",

    "description": "It’s humbling that way every September, without fail, knocks me on my rump. One week, you’re breezy and unscheduled, reading books on a beach and tearing lobster apart with your bare hands (indeed, we were in Maine) and the next you’re realizing a certain fetid backpack was never emptied on the last day of school in June, scrambling for after-school care, and despite the fact that I work every week of the year, somehow there’s a lot more to do. If dinner can’t be made in one pan in which everything cooks at once, I haven’t been making it. And yet I’ve made this chicken dish four times in the last month; it’s clearly time to shout about it across the internet. Read more »",

It’s one part wedge salad, the fork and steak knife kind, something I am so into I talked my podcast co-host Kenji (okay, it wasn’t hard) into dedicating a whole episode to it. And it contains cabbage, and not just cabbage but Napa cabbage, which I think deserves more credit as a salad green. [This can be convenient to know as it often comes in heads large enough to feed a small family for a week.] Napa cabbage is a little leafy, a little crunchy, and yet kind of juicy too and I’ve used it, sliced thin, in everything from this Italian-style salad to a classic Caesar.

    "description": "Last summer, when my younger child joined my older child at sleepaway camp for a month for the first time, leaving us unmoored and a little restless, we made a list of restaurants we’d been meaning to try and friends we don’t see enough and took this task on like it was our job. I barely cooked once. By the end of the third week, everything hurt and we realized our template for a child-free life (going out late, cocktails on weeknights, and generally behaving despicably) was based on our age and energy level when we were last child-free, which (I’m sorry as this fact seems to upset you guys as much as it does his actual parents) was almost 15 years ago.

Mostly, we’ve been too busy eating it for me to grab the camera and shoot it and then sit down and write the recipe, which is hilarious as that’s, like, my whole job. But my brain softens in the summer, especially when my kids are away at sleepaway camp, as they are now, and we quickly lose whatever tethers we had to things like to-do lists, responsibilities, and adulting. And while I do not expect a skirt steak with a cherry tomato and sweet corn salad to shake the cooking internet off its axis, there are a bunch of tips tucked into this recipe that make it a reliable favorite, and I hope become part of your repertoire too.

Get inspired—sign up here for her emails. Last week, New York Times Cooking celebrated the 10-year anniversary of its incredibly successful cooking app. In truth, the app’s success was more like 20 years in the making. The Times had wanted to digitize its vast recipe archive since the early 2000s, but due to a lot of internal to-ing and fro-ing (something the Times specializes in), it took more than a decade to take the leap. The extended maceration has proven worthwhile—they got it right. They understood their readership’s long held desire for inspiration, recipes they can trust, and a place to be heard about it. The app shines not only because of the breadth and quality of its content but because of the wacky and endearing commentary from its readers. Read More \u003e\u003e",

A year later, I’ve arrived at two conclusions: One, many of these drinks are delicious on their own; and two, they’re even better when combined with actual alcohol. The latter conclusion sprung from necessity. This past June, while vacationing in Ojai—a town two hours north of Los Angeles that’s best at citrus, restaurants, and reminding tourists that the sun always gets its way—I became very, very hot. In search of refreshment (and a breath of fresh air conditioning), I sprinted into a hotel lobby and panic-ordered iced water, light beer, and Ghia’s canned Le Spritz Lime \u0026 Salt.

    "description": "Although we at Food52 love to celebrate the avid home cook, a quick scroll through any collection of our most popular recipes proves the following: Our community really, really loves recipes developed by world-class chefs. So we took the notes and created Yes, Chef—a new video series where talented, working chefs share their favorite techniques, ingredients, and dishes directly with you. In the series’ first episode, we’re joined by Jeff Kim, the chef and co-owner of Nudibranch—an East Village hotspot that weaves together Korean and Spanish flavors. The restaurant reflects Jeff’s culinary journey: Prior to opening his own spot, the young chef cut his teeth at New York City hotspots like Momofuku Ssäm Bar and Eleven Madison Park as well as at Spain’s three-Michelin-starred El Celler de Can Roca.

    "description": "We’ve partnered with Marqués de Cáceres to feature five Spanish dishes that pair perfectly with their premium wines. From a fruit-forward rosé to bubbly cava, there’s a wine to fit every mood. There’s no better way to capture the taste of Spain than with a glass of Marqués de Cáceres. But to really bring those Iberian flavors home, the well-known Spanish wine brand tapped Chef David Viana from The Lovely Lita to create five dishes to pair with their wines. If you’re unfamiliar, The Lovely Lita is a modern Iberian restaurant in Aberdeen, New Jersey which highlights classic dishes in unexpected preparations (think: paella with duck confit and chorizo, or salted cod agnolotti). It was a James Beard Award semifinalist for the best new restaurant in the country this year, a fitting recognition for David, who received a Best Chef nom in 2018 from the James Beard Foundation. This partnership brings the two together with an enticing menu to pair with any bottle of Marqués de Cáceres, from a sparkling Cava Brut to a bold Reserva. Despite being a few thousand miles away from Spain, the Rioja-based, family-run winery easily transports you back with every sip. Read More \u003e\u003e",

(I’ve probably just jinxed us—watch the temperature drop as soon as I post this.) Even so, my kitchen is starting to shift into cozy mode, and these are the recipes I’m leaning into right now.

Let me take you on a little stroll down memory lane—back to 2009, when red velvet was having its moment, and I had just discovered the life-altering magic of browned butter.

    "description": "She told me about what she thinks about her body; that people at her table are talking about getting married. She listens to my feedback about her effort at soccer practice and asks me to speak in a more calm voice (I wasn’t yelling for the record, but I do get passionate when I want to make a point. That point being: please act like you want to be there). He wants me to listen to the fart joke in his audio book or the techno song that he likes, even though it “feels stressful” (it does). He tears up over feeling like everyone at school just argues over football rules everyday and remarks he wants to live with us forever. I get so much from them at bed time, like everyone is ready to unload, and maybe this is a season, and one I’ll miss if it is, but when did they become people? Messy ones who still need to be reminded to put their clothes away 385798410 times, but these complicated feelings over friendship and motivation and little and big questions are pretty remarkable. I am planning some travel for a few book events, and it struck me how much I really love the ages of our kids. It’s so much easier now - they’re more flexible to take along, their thoughts are interesting and funny. I’d want to be both of their friends if I got to go back to elementary school. Curran is turning 10, I’m turning 40, a book that feels like it took forever to make it finally coming out this Spring and in a good way, it feels more like New Years than January did. At a glance, zooming out, asking questions and reorienting perspective. Here we are, and isn’t that just amazing.All those memes about how people hate that bloggers write musings instead of just post recipes. It’s not always for you, dearest recipe searcher, sometimes the writing is just as much the connection as the food is, so you’re going to have to bear with me. Many people I know who connect through making people food, are also writers and thinkers and communicators, so it’s a package deal, folks. It’s pillow talk and pasta over here. Speaking of the cookbook! Most every recipe in there has a photo except for, maybe 4? There are factors that contribute like page count and price etc. so a few final shots just didn’t make it in. Unfortunately, no photo usually means less intrigue and the recipe can get overlooked, so I’m going to highlight one of my favorites here. I love pasta with lots of bits in it and this one is heavy on the bits. My kids will eat this, picking around the extra kale and Cleo won’t actually like it, but they eat it. Either way, I do think you should put this one on your list soon.I also wanted to post a few dates for some cookbook events coming up around the time of publishing. If you live in any of these areas, I would really love to meet you! If more get added, I will include them here as a landing page.

You may end up with more kale pesto than you need for this recipe, but it has lots of other uses, such as with eggs, atop roast potatoes, or as a veggie sandwich spread. We don’t want the fresh sausage-like chorizo in tube form; instead, look for a dry chorizo, typically from Spain, not Mexico, that you will find in a well stocked cheese and deli section. It looks like salami. I do think sucessful dinner prep takes a bit of planning. The pesto can be made a few days in advance to save time. Vegetarian? Replace the chorizo with some chopped, sun dried tomatoes. Printed from Around Our Table by Sara ForteFOR THE WINTER PESTO2 cloves garlic1/4 cup pine nuts2 Tbsp. lemon juice1 cup cilantro or parsley1 packed cup lacinato kale, deribbed and chopped1 tsp. sea salt1/2 tsp. fresh ground pepper1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil1/4 cup grated parmesan cheeseFOR THE CAULIFLOWER1 head cauliflower, broken into small florets3 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil1 tsp. dried oreganosea salt and fresh ground pepper2 oz. dried chorizo, cut in 1” ribbons1 small bundle lacinato kale, deribbed and cut in ribbons12 oz. any short pastahalf of one lemongrated parmesan, red pepper flakes, fresh parsley, for garnishMake the kale pesto. In a food processor, pulse the garlic, pine nuts and lemon juice together. Add the cilantro and/or parsley, chopped kale, salt and pepper, and run it again until well chopped. With the motor going, drizzle in the olive oil and parmesan cheese. Set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Preheat the oven to 425’. On a rimmed baking sheet, pile the cauliflower, and drizzle it with the olive oil, oregano, salt and pepper. Toss well to coat and roast for 30 minutes until the edges are toasty. To the baking sheet, add the chorizo and kale ribbons, toss everything to coat. If the sheet looks dry, add another drizzle of oil. Roast an additional 3 minutes to warm. Set aside.Cook your pasta according to instructions. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water. Drain the pasta and put it back in the pot with a few heaping spoonfuls of the pesto and a giant splash of the pasta water. Stir to mix, we want it generously sauced. Add the contents of the baking sheet, squeeze of fresh lemon and stir again. Add more pesto if you’d like or more pasta water to loosen things up. Serve portions with a generous sprinkling of parmesan, red pepper flakes, a grind of pepper and some fresh parsley.",

    "link": "https://www.sproutedkitchen.com/home/2022/2/15/after-school-banana-chocolate-chip-chunkers",
    "description": "I always buy a bundle of bananas at the market, only 1 of 4 of us actually snacks on a banana, which leaves lots of moments of overripe bananas that are too ripe for snacking but perfect for baking. 4 of 4 like the baked goods with the bananas. You’re welcome for my elementary math equation proving it is in fact, worth buying the bananas. These are my favorite sorts of treats to make for and with the kids. Everything mashes up in one bowl, they’re easy on the sugar, packs in a lunchbox and they are free of the glutens and dairy so any person that comes over with a dietary preference, has a snack. I know when we’ve made them a dozen times, they are worth sharing here, so hope you have bananas ready to go soon (extra extra brown! don’t bother if they are pretty and yellow!). xoAFTER SCHOOL BANANA CHOCOLATE CHIP CHUNKERSMakes 12Gluten free, dairy free and honestly, you can skip the egg if you need to and I believe they’ll still hold. I’ve been making these when I have dead bananas, but banana bread feels like too much. A tray of these will be gone before the end of the day and they hold up in a lunch box too. Nut allergy folks, all-purpose flour is fine. Replace the almond and coconut flours with 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour. They will look different than what is pictured. The flax does help absorb some extra moisture, and you can pick that up and nearly any supermarket these days. Recipe riffed from Joy the Baker2 overripe, medium bananas (about 1 cup)1 egg4 Tbsp. coconut oil or warmed butter1/3 cup light brown sugar1 tsp. vanilla extract1/2 tsp. cinnamonbig pinch of salt1 cup almond flour1/4 cup old fashioned oats2 Tbsp. flax meal3 Tbsp. coconut flour1/4 tsp. baking soda 1/2 tsp. baking powder2/3 cup dark chocolate chips (or chopped chocolate)Into a mixing bowl, smash up the bananas super well, we don’t want big chunks left. Add in the egg, oil or butter, sugar, vanilla , cinnamon, salt and whisk everything together to mix. Add the almond flour, oats, flax, coconut flour, baking powder and stir again to combine. Fold in the chocolate chips. Chill the mixture for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 360’ and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. I make ours free-formed, not perfect balls 1) because they are tough to get into a ball and 2) I like those craggle edges! We want about 2-3 Tbsp. sized lumps, arranged with 2” of space between (they don’t spread much). Bake on the middle rack for 12-15 minutes until toasty on the edges, but still tender in the center. Remove to cool. Keep the cookies in a covered container at room temperature for up for 3 days, and in the fridge any longer than that.

    "description": "She was sitting on the edge of the pool, waiting for her turn at swim lessons and was completely sausaged into her swimsuit. Her longer body stretching the length of the bathing suit so that the chest of it was too low and the straps looked stressed. Beautiful, tender, winter skin against that mustard yellow daisy print. Cleo waves at me, looking like such a… girl. She turned six a few weeks ago and while we are dancing in the kitchen to the Encanto soundtrack and mixing up our “b’s” and “d’s” , our conversations are about friendships at school and what happens when you die. She is both little and big to me. Motherhood is a wild whiplash. Each one of those days, while the bathing suit became too small, felt like nothing, but is also the compilation of so many small moments. I’m having a bit of a time with my own insecurities and watching them find their way at school and with people. My kids growth, tangled up and digested through my own. It’s just like the moms before me said, the challenges never go away, they just change. I see this girl of mine growing, still needing me, but also moving towards my role as support, instead of the lead. Yessss, I know she’s young, but I can see it. A small shift, the ones you can miss if you’re not paying attention. January used to be a month of goals all organized on paper - less sugar and new tennis shoes to get moving but this one felt… observant. Curious. Asking what I want, and what my family needs, as opposed to the more/better mentality that a new year sells you. I want to take a few classes, read books to learn things - parts of history that didn’t stick through school, or Spanish so I can help my kids with homework without so much google translation. We need a vacation that feels different, exciting. I learned from our covid quarantine week that we need more time just playing and hanging, as opposed to schedules and sports and social plans that I naturally tend towards. That includes me, stopping, not wiping down counters when I can afford to sit and compose some legos, or bead for a bit instead. I can feel and see a different season with my kids and while I definitely prefer it to toddlerhood (preach!), it feels like things are moving quickly and I’ll have to stay connected to myself, to see these simple, magical moments with my family.With that said, let me share this casserole that went over really well with my Sprouted Kitchen Cooking Club folks. It’s two pans and veggies that can be swapped and kid friendly because who doesn’t love orzo? I delivered one to a friend who said it stretched for two meals, so keep this in your back pocket for delivery.Anyway. From my tender heart to yours this month, hope you are healthy and well and feeling hopeful about this next year. Cheers. BROCCOLI + MUSHROOM ORZO BAKE // Serves 6It’s like a mac n cheese-ish pasta bake but with some vegetables in it. My kids like broccoli, but you could get away with whatever your people like in similar volume, and cooked before adding it in. So long as the mushrooms are super small, I can squeeze those by them. Sub in peas or hunks of cooked butternut squash or add in 1/2 lb. of browned Italian sausage if you prefer an animal protein in there. If you’re making this to deliver or freeze, assemble everything through the panko parm topper, and wrap it in foil. Pass along directions to bring it to room temperature before baking. Ingredients2 Tbsp. of extra virgin olive oil or butter1 small yellow onion - chopped small8 oz. of mushrooms - wiped clean, super well chopped3 cloves of garlic - mincedsea saltpepper2/3 cup of white wine1 pinch of red pepper flakes2 tsp. of fresh thyme leaves3 cups of vegetable or chicken stock1/2 lb. of orzo (about 1 heaping cup)10 oz. of broccoli florets - steamed \u0026 chopped1/2 cup of heavy cream1 lemon - zested4 oz. of grated fontina or Italian cheese blend1 cup of panko1/4 cup of parmeseanextra virgin olive oilfresh parsley - choppedDirectionsGrease an 8” pan or 10” oven-proof skillet. Preheat the oven to 400’.In a large Dutch oven or skillet over medium, heat your oil or butter. Add the onion, and sauté a few minutes until tender. Add the mushrooms, garlic, big pinches of salt and pepper and sauté another 5 minutes, until the liquid is released and you get some browning. Stir in the wine and cook another 5 minutes to cook down. Stir in the pepper flakes, thyme, and turn off the heat.In another pot, heat the broth to a gentle boil. Add the orzo and cook for about 7 minutes until just tender. Yes, it will absorb most of the moisture.Transfer the orzo and any residual broth to the pot with the mushrooms. Add the steamed broccoli, cream, lemon zest, cheese and another pinch of salt and pepper. Fold everything to combine. It should be loose.Transfer the mixture to your prepared pan. Sprinkle the panko and parm on top, and drizzle it with olive oil (it can be refrigerated for a day or frozen at this point. Bring the refrigerated one to room temperature before baking. Cook the frozen one, covered for 25 then uncovered for 20). Bake for 20 minutes, uncovered, until the top is golden brown.Garnish with fresh herbs.TipsMake AheadThe entire casserole can be assembled up to a day in advance and baked just before serving. It can be frozen pre-bake as well.Use It TwiceThis makes a lot of food, would be a great one to double and gift or freeze for later.Kid FriendlySo long as you get your mushrooms and broccoli small, mine loved it!Gluten FreeJovial makes a cassava-based orzo. It can get gummy, but I think it will still work here. It’s possible a long-grain brown rice would work here, too. I would just steam it before assembling, and add two eggs in there if you can to help it hold some shape.",

    "description": "Fa la la la la! It’s baking season and this cake was a hit. Of course we all love cookies, and I have plenty of those on the list. My people love a breakfast sweet, and this has stood in for a simple dinner dessert on occasion as well. I know you all love to have a spread planned for holiday mornings, so hope this works for those of you gluten free folks. We always have sweet rolls, but I may double up this year since everyone liked this cake so much. I’ll say it again, like we do with the lemon loaf or banana bread, toasted for a few minutes for a bit of a crisp edge is lovely. I have made many dense gf baked goods, but I’m starting to figure out the ratios. Eggs are important for strength, going all almond flour turns out pretty dense, so I cut it with superfine brown rice flour like I learned from Aran of Canelle et Vanille. Hugh is the gluten free one in the family, but I have found the kids don’t question a thing when it looks like cookies and cake and sugar. I added some swap suggestions in the headnote. GLUTEN FREE CRANBERRY TEA CAKE Serves 6-8This could be part of a breakfast spread or a dessert. It is sweet and seasonal but we nibbled at it most in the afternoon with a second (er, third) cup of coffee or tea. It has a good amount of moisture, so it sits well at room temperature for a day or two, then should be kept covered in the fridge. Great served with a dollop of plain yogurt in the morning or sweetened creme fraiche for dessert.Dairy-free option is to replace the buttermilk with non-dairy milk with a squeeze of lemon juice - oat or almond both great, coconut is a bit heavy. You don’t need it gluten free, replace the almond and rice flours with 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour. Not cranberry season? try lemon blueberry or almond raspberry (replace the vanilla with almond extract).Ingredients6 Tbsp. unsalted butter (vegan butter works great!), room temperature3/4 cup cane sugar2 Tbsp. avocado or coconut oil2 eggs1/2 cup buttermilk (or non-dairy milk with a squeeze of lemon juice)1/4 cup maple syrup1 tsp. vanilla extractzest of one orange1 cup almond flour1 cup superfine brown rice flour (I buy this one)2 tsp. baking powder1/2 tsp. sea salt2 cups (8 oz.) fresh or frozen cranberries, roughly choppedturbinado sugar, for finishingsweetened yogurt, for servingDirectionsPreheat the oven to 350’ and parchment line and butter a 8-9” cake pan. In a stand mixer or with an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar together until fluffy. At least 3 minutes. Add the oil, eggs, buttermilk, maple, vanilla, orange zest and beat again to incorporate. Add the almond and rice flours, baking powder, salt and fold it a few times. Add half the cranberries and fold again. Transfer it to your prepared pan, sprinkle the remaining cranberries over top, swipe it down to an even layer, and sprinkle the top generously with turbinado sugar. Bake on the middle rack for about 50 minutes, until tested in the center and only a few crumbs (no batter!) come out with it. If the top starts to get to brown, cover it with a piece of parchment or foil. Let the cake cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing. Serve with yogurt or sweetened creme fraiche.",

    "description": "It has been a busy cookbook season! I spent last night reading through the Ottolenghi Test Kitchen Cookbook and am revisiting everything I have bookmarked in Aran’s Cannelle et Vanille Bakes Simple while it is rainy this week and we can work on some baking projects. If you eat gluten free, by need or choice, Aran is your gal. You may know her from her gf sourdough tutorials on instagram.Aran is one of my favorite food people. Most importantly, she is a lovely and generous person. Just as humble and charming as her photos lead you to believe. Her photos are romantic, the recipes are clear and uncomplicated and she offers subs for all sorts of dietary issues. She is the gluten free baking master, and always where I go for reference. The book does call for some specialty flours, but if you cook gluten free and make a few things from her book, they won’t go to waste. My favorites have been the Lemon Curd, Lemon Pound Cake, Double Chocolate Crinkle Cookies and this toffee! I love how short the list of ingredients is, you may even have everything to make a batch today. Congrats, Aran! CHOCOLATE-HAZELNUT TOFFEEMakes one 9x13 panThis makes an excellent gift around the holidays. We kept it in the fridge for when you just need a sweet nibble after a meal. If you are nut free, you can sub in some candied pepitas or some crushed candy canes and cocoa nibs on top. Ingredients: ¾ cup (100 g ) raw hazelnuts1 cup unsalted butter (or dairy free butter) cut into cubes¾ cup sugar½ cup light brown sugar¼ cup water, room temperature½ tsp. Kosher salt2 tsp. Vanilla extract¼ tsp baking soda4 ounces 70% chocolate, finely choppedInstructions: Preheat the oven to 325’ and line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. On a second sheet, spread the hazelnuts and roast for 15-20 minutes, until fragrant and golden brown. When they are cool enough to handle, transfer them to a large kitchen towel and rub together to loosen their skins. Once they’re mostly peeled (a bit of skin is ok), transfer them to a food processor and pulse a few times to roughly chop. Set aside. In a medium saucepan, stir together the butter, both sugar, water and salt. Cook over medium-high heat, undisturbed, until it registers at 300’, about 15 minutes. The mixture will be dark brown and smell caramelized. Remove the pan from the heat and carefully add the vanilla, it will splatter. Stir in the baking soda until it is distributed - do not overmix. You want to preserve some of that gas. Pour the toffee onto the prepared baking sheet and spread it evenly with a spatula. Sprinkle the top with the chopped chocolate. The heat of the toffee will melt it. Spread it evenly with a spatula. Distribute the chopped hazelnuts across the top and press down so they stick into the chocolate. Let the toffee cool completely for a few hours, or speed up this process in the fridge. Break the toffee into pieces and store in an airtight container for up to a month.©2021 by Aran Goyoaga. Excerpted from Cannelle et Vanille Bakes Simple by permission of Sasquatch Books.",

    "link": "https://www.sproutedkitchen.com/home/2021/9/23/eggplant-tofu-with-sweet-hot-chili-glaze",
    "description": "Dinner seems so hard sometimes. I cook for SKCC during the day, so we have wonderful lunches, and obviously there are leftovers, but that leaves me not following my own advice as far as having a plan for dinner most nights. Ironic isn’t it? I have plans for lunch, we rotate the same few things for breakfast, but why does everyone eat so often? I have so so many cookbooks, and always turn there when inspiration eludes me. I’ll add a short list here, should you need some new ideas yourself. My family is not vegetarian, but we try to eat vegetarian meals often. The list below (amazon affiliated) includes both omnivorous and vegetarian authors from books (not new!) I’ve been turning to for inspiration lately:Anna Jones (vegetarian, more carb heavy but simple, she has a few great ones!)Green Kitchen Stories (strong vegetarian meals, colorful and present well)Six Seasons (new ideas and combinations, but not fussy. Great side ideas)At Home in the Whole Foods Kitchen (a cornerstone, easy to change ingredients by season, very “healthy”)Canelle et Vanille (Aran’s photos are transcendent and romantic and her food is delicious. All GF)Super Natural Everyday (my favorite of Heidi’s, great vegetarian meals and wholesome snack and breakfast ideas)Salt Fat Acid Heat (for when I have lots of ingredients, but no ideas. Not a cookbook per se, but gets my mind going)Mandy’s Gourmet Salads (mostly for me, but they are sturdy salads when I can pull things out easily for the kids)The recipe here is from the beloved Jenny Rosenstrach of Dinner, A Love Story. Her recipes are quintessential family dinner type of cooking. Easy to find ingredients, not overly fussy, likeable for adults and kids. While it may not be what you’d pull out for entertaining or something unique, it is dependable and practical, which is what we all need most nights. I have tried her brothy beans and this dish below and both were hits! Look forward to pulling from this for quick weeknight meals. EGGPLANT + TOFU WITH SWEET HOT CHILI GLAZE // Serves 4This was so delicious with all that sauce! I put mine in a lettuce wrap to get more greens in, or could see it with some thinly sliced cabbage. Recipe from Weekday Vegetarians By Jenny Rosenstrach(I reduced the amount of oil to personal preference)1 15 oz. block of extra-firm tofu, pressed, drained and cubed1/4 cup avocado or olive oil2 Tbsp. toasted sesame oil3 Tbsp. soy sauce1 Tbsp. cornstarch or arrowroot 1 lb. eggplants, preferably graffiti, cubedsalt and pepper, to taste1/3 cup sweet-hot-chili glaze*4 cups cooked riceFOR SERVINGcilantro, sliced radishes, scallions, toasted cashewsPreheat the oven to 425’. Arrange one rack on the top rack and one on the middle. Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment.In a large bowl, toss the tofu cubes with half of both oils, soy sauce, cornstarch. Use a slotted spoon, place the tofu on one of the prepared pans.In the same bowl, add the remaining oil and the eggplant, along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss to coat. Place the eggplant on the other sheetpan. Place the tofu on the top rack of the oven and eggplant on the middle rack. Bake until the tofu looks crispy and golden, 20 minutes. Remove the tofu to a shallow serving bowl, move the eggplant to the top rack and continue to roast another 10 minutes until golden. Remove the eggplant and transfer it to the dish with the tofu. Drizzle 3 tablespoons of the glaze over the tofu-eggplant mixture and gently toss to coat. Serve over rice with desired garnishes. SWEET HOT CHILI GLAZE3 Tbsp. hot chili sauce (such as cholula or Pete’s)2 Tbsp. honey2 Tbsp. light brown sugar4 Tbsp. unsalted butter (or vegan alternative, we love Miyokos)fresh black pepperIn a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the chili sauce, honey, brown sugar, pinch of salt and simmer until the sugar has dissolved completely. Remove the pan from the heat and while the mixture is hot, whisk in the butter to thicken the sauce. Season with salt and pepper.",

    "link": "https://www.sproutedkitchen.com/home/2021/9/2/healthy-smash-cake",
    "description": "I really wanted to push this as a smash cake idea, but I must tell you that in retesting, it is quite delicate. It is DELICIOUS, but she is not a sturdy, easy to frost cake. I’ll give it to you straight in case you have dreams of a Pinterest-worthy sprinkle dream cake. We’re using banana and maple here, and with the sweetness and tang of the frosting, it all balances to be quite the treat. I tested it with both maple and sugar, the prior resulting in a more damp cake, and certainly less sweet, and the later a bit more traditional (and easier to frost). It gets sweetness from over ripe bananas, and I used Greek yogurt to help “frost” it. Know that Greek yogurt does not hold well at room temperature any longer than an hour, so I would suggest making the cake in advance and assembling it with the yogurt just before serving. Alternatively, if you need it to be sitting out over an hour, or hold stronger for decorating, I would make a half batch of this frosting, and just go easy on the amount. This is so many suggestions! I’m sorry, but there is cake. MAPLE BANANA CAKE WITH YOGURT FROSTING Make one 8” cakeI call for quick oats, which may sound annoying and you can use old-fashioned oats with a little pulse in a food processor or blender to break them down a bit. If you want a nicer textured cake, less dense, cake flour in its place here will help. If you do not time your life to have brown bananas in time, canned pumpkin does the trick.A high fat content Greek yogurt is important here. Regular yogurt or anything runny will not work. Egg Free: Make a flax egg by mixing the flaxmeal with a Tbsp. of water until it starts to thicken. The banana helps hold things, this doesn’t work as well with the pumpkin swap.Gluten Free: Use a GF 1:1 flour in place of the whole wheat pastry flour. Ingredients1/2 cup maple syrup3/4 cup mashed, overripe bananas (about a medium)1/3 cup coconut oil, warmed1 tsp. vanilla extract2 eggs, room temp1 1/4 cup all purpose flour or cake flour3/4 cup quick-cooking oats, or pulsed oats (blitzed in a food processor or blender)1 tsp. baking powder1/2 tsp. baking soda1/2 tsp. cinnamonpinch of sea saltYOGURT FROSTING2 Tbsp. butter, room temp2 Tbsp. cream cheese, room temp6 oz. full-fat Greek yogurt1 cup powdered sugar for a firmer frosting, maple worksdash of vanilla extractDirectionsPreheat the oven to 350’. Grease and parchment line a 8” pan or three, 6-8” cake rounds (this will yield much thicker layers). In a large mixing bowl, or stand mixer with paddle attachment, combine the maple, smashed bananas, coconut oil, vanilla and eggs. Mix well to combine. Add the flour, pulsed oats, baking powder and soda, cinnamon, salt, and give it a few more stirs to just combine. Tip it into the pan and bake for 30 minutes, until cooked in the center. Remove to cool completely. In a mixer, combine the butter and cream cheese until smooth and aerated a bit. Add the yogurt, powdered sugar, vanilla and mix until combined and smooth. This can be done in advance and kept in the fridge for a few days. Chill to firm up it needed. If you’re leaving this as a 8” cake, just frost and enjoy. If making a smash cake, use a round tupperware, jar or larger glass to get 2 to 3 circles from the cake and eat the scraps. Layer the cakes with some frosting between, and then over the sides and top. The cake is easier to work with if it is cold! It does need to be kept in the fridge once frosted!",

    "description": "It used to be easier to write here. I like imagining who I am writing to and I’ve lost some of that here. I thought Instagram was a more effective place to share, but that place changed for me, as well. So, I want to be back here like I used to be. Every week if I can, which may be lofty, but I’m going to try. Writing about life or nothing, and sharing something that I made with you all. Perhaps not always a meal, even just a dressing we liked or something from a cookbook I’m enjoying. Would love to engage with you all. I just feel like there are almost too many ways now, and I need to keep shifting to find what fits. Anyway. Hi. Speaking of you and me and connecting. I am doing a short-ish Zoom demo/class with my Cooking Club folks on Sunday morning at 9am PST. Admittance will be the recipe of a donation to Cajun Navy Relief, or any non-profit involved in the relief efforts in New Orleans. Please email or DM a receipt by Saturday. I would love to have any of you non-members along as well. We’re making some kid-friendly things - zucchini and bean taquitos with some avocado dressing to dip and maybe a nectarine crumble crisp if there is enough time. Quinoa \u0026 Sweet Potato Saladw/ Turmeric Tahini DressingServes 2The recipe is tinkered from the Many’s Gourmet Salads cookbook which has some truly excellent ideas for fellow salad lovers. It can take add ins, a swap of olives in for the feta to keep it dairy free, but by all means, double the dressing. It works as a dip and dressing for all sort of things. Have to laugh at home many meals on this site include sweet potatoes and quinoa BUT! Here we are, and it’s so good. You can cook quinoa and lentils together with 2:1 water to lentil and quinoa ratio. Bring to a simmer, turn down the heat and cook with the cover ajar for about 20 minutes. Fluff with a fork and set aside to cool. This does require a wee bit of prep, so if you are a salad person, I suggest doubling it and having the components on hand to make this salad a few times throughout the week. Everything saves well. I’ve added grilled chicken or salmon or toss extra firm squares of tofu in oil and coconut aminos and roasting it at a high heat until golden, about 20 minutes, for a veg friendly topping. However, it doesn’t need any of these add-ins, it is plenty satisfying as is!Recipe adapted from Mandy’s Salads Ingredients1 large sweet potato - peeled \u0026 diced1 Tbsp. of avocado oilsea saltfresh ground pepper4 cups of spring mix2 cups of baby kale1/2 cup of cooked quinoa1/2 cup of cooked \u0026 drained lentils2 cups of diced cucumbers1 cup of cherry tomatoes1/4 cup of red onion - sliced paper thin4 oz. of crumbled feta1/4 cup of torn mint leaves1/4 cup of chopped parsley1/2 cup of crispy chickpeas - store-bought or homemade2 Tbsp. of sesame seedshandful of dill For the turmeric tahini dressing1/4 cup of tahini1/4 cup of room temp water1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar1 lemon - juiced1 tsp. of turmericdash of cayenne1/2 tsp. of curry powder2 cloves of garlic - grated1 tsp. of toasted sesame oil1/3 cup of flat-leaf parsley1/2 cup of extra virgin olive oil1/2 tsp. of sea saltfresh ground pepper to tasteDirectionsPreheat the oven to 425’ and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

    "description": "I love love Trader Joes Zhoug sauce and we use it often, but I’m trying to reduce our single use packaging, and this is way better anyway. I finally have notes down so we can make and gift it on our own. I have written about 3 dozen green sauce-ish recipes here, SK Cooking Club etc. - each a little bit different. This one, heavy on the heat and herbs, and a few warm spices. Because it is so warm, I think of it like a concentrate instead of just straight up (ie. putting a dollop in salad dressing or mashing with avocado). Adding just a pinch of sugar and squeeze of lime to balance it. Zhoug is of Yemenite origin, and usually found on tables in Syria and Israel. It truly boosts anything and will certainly be a go-to summer condiment for salads and flatbread and grilled items. UsesStir a spoonful into a salad dressingMix with plain Greek yogurt to make a dipWith avocado toastAs a protein marinade for any meat, often mixed with some toasted sesame oil and citrus for meat and chicken, or painted on seafood after grilling. Cucumber salad with this, a splash of champagne vinegar, tons of dill, shaved red onionEgg sandwich spreadGrilled cornPasta salad with lots of grilled zucchini, more herbs, baby tomatoes, feta cheeseIf you make it, leave a comment about how you used it! ZHOUG SAUCEMakes about 10 oz.You can use a bit more oil if you’d like a thinner yet richer sauce, something closer to traditional Italian pesto. The below will be very herb heavy, as I prefer it this way so it can be thinned with citrus for dressings, marinades, smashed with avocado and the like. It will separate a bit which is absolutely fine and expected. The sauce will last for 1-2 weeks in the fridge. Getting spicier as it sits so heads up!Riffed from both Ottolenghi and Cookie and Kate Ingredients4 cloves garlic3 jalapenos, stemmed, partially seeded and chopped1 bundle of parsley (1 packed cup)1 bundle cilantro (1 packed cup)1/2 tsp. cumin1/2 tsp. ground corianderdash of cayenne1/2 tsp. cardamompinch of sugar3/4 tsp. sea saltsqueeze of lime1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, as neededDirectionsPut the garlic and jalapenos in a food processor and pulse a few times to chop. Add the parsley, cilantro, cumin, coriander, cayenne, cardamom, sugar, salt and lime juice and pulse a few more times. With the motor going, drizzle in the oil, scrapping down the sides to get an even, smooth sauce (still a little chunky tho). Taste for salt and seasonings. You can always add more cayenne if needed but it will get spicier as it ages.",

    "description": "May is a big month for us. It is busy and exciting and expensive because there are a bundle of birthdays (around 10 between our two families!) and Mother’s Day and our school year will be ending and while it has felt like Spring for a while here, May sets it straight. Strawberries and sunshine and bursting gardens and longer light. More so than a new calendar year, in May I feel a pull to write and remember and make goals and take stock of how I am spending my time - to both focus in and cast out a wider net for what could be. A New Years of sorts. I think it’s many of us, but for working moms in a different kind of way, this past year+ felt like so much surviving. That is a generalization, as circumstances vary widely I’m aware, but mothers shouldered a lot of the toughest parts. Quietly, keeping their game face on, but it was a lot. It felt like a day by day of keeping heads above water and constant pivoting. I feel a bit of exhale this season, even though this pandemic is not over over, it is better in our corner of the world, and I’m ready to reclaim some things of my own. I see the holes and my own excuses. The kids and I have this little diddy I do with them when Cur gets super wild with his buddies or I can see Cleo is on the verge of loosing it because she made a mistake on her picture: “Connect to your head (taps head), connect to your heart (taps heart) and slow down (slow hands).” My hope is that it brings them… us, into our own bodies when we can easily disconnect. It has hand motions of course because 5 and 7 years old, but it’s a simple mantra. Pay attention. You are already good. This past year was so wild! Connect to your head, connect to your heart, and slow down. And while you’re at it, springy bowls below because sauce makes everything better :) SPRING BOWLS WITH ALMOND ARUGULA PESTOServes 4This may make more pesto than you need, and is great to have on hand for eggs, sandwiches, dipping of any sorts. These bowls are satisfying as is, but can take a poached egg or whatever protein you have to throw on the grill or some rotiserrie chicken. No dairy? You can skip the parmesan in the pesto, no problem. Ingredients2 cloves garlic1/3 cup lightly toasted almonds, plus more for bowl garnish1 jalapeno or serrano, stemmed and seeded to taste3/4 tsp. sea saltjuice from one small lemon, about 4 Tbsp. 4 oz. arugula2 Tbsp. grated parmesan1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil12 oz. asparagus1 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil1/2 tsp. everyday/grilling seasoning blendsalt and pepper1 cup cooked lentils1 Tbsp. olive oil2 tsp. Dijon mustard2 Tbsp. champagne vinegar or apple cider vinegar1 Tbsp. minced shallothandful of minced chives2 cups cooked quinoa4 radishes, shaved2 avocados, quarteredDirectionsTo make the pesto, put the garlic, almonds, jalapeno and salt in a food processor and pulse to break them down. Add the lemon juice, arugula, parm and pulse a few more times. With the motor going, drizzle in the olive oil and run until you get the texture you want. I end up adding a small splash of water. Set aside. This can be made in advance and keep for a week or so in the fridge. Preheat the oven to 425’. Snap the ends off the asparagus and then use a peeler to clean up the bottom edges so they are smooth and tapered. It looks fancy, Ina does it, so we’re doing it too but you also don’t have to. Oil and season them and roast for 12 minutes until just tender but not mooshy.Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, combine the lentils with the olive oil, mustard, vinegar, shallot and a few pinches of salt and pepper and stir to combine. Add fresh chives, stir again. Assemble your bowls with some quinoa, dressed lentils, roasted asparagus and a few shaved radishes for garnish. Nestle in a wedge or two of avocado, puddle of pesto and some toasted almonds over top.

    "description": "“I want you to come watch the movie with us ON the couch, not be in the kitchen!”I’ve been filling out this one-question-a-day journals for moms that I received for Christmas. It records a little thought or memory over the last year, and then starts again, so you can see how your answers change over a few years. One of the recent ones, prompted me to jot notes about what I am learning as a mom, and I found the question so general I was basically annoyed. I am a romantic, and also wildly pragmatic. In the span of a day I can tear up over the depths of love I feel for my kids, and also wish for them to have a mute button. We all have worlds within us; mothering pushing me into the corners of myself I am sometimes proud of or other corners ashamed of, but am I learning? Yes, every single day. Sometimes in the moment and other times after a particular season. But in 2021, my answer in the bullet journal was that I see my kids are wanting me to play with them. They aren’t registering all the service and shuttling and laundry and what it takes to pull off a week, they just want to play WITH me. It’s natural for me to move within lists and tasks and responsibilities and hustling, but playing is something I have to pay attention to. For them and for me. We usually do a family movie on Friday nights and my son (6.5), see quote above, pointed out that I don’t actually watch the movie, I tinker in the kitchen and he wants me in the couch cuddle. Flattered, and found out that I’d rather make granola than watch The Croods :) So from annoyed, to passing on the question to fellow parents, what are you learning? Try not to be annoyed. Maybe circle back to it. I published this recipe over on SKCC a few weeks ago and wanted it to live here. We’re trying to find more family-friendly vegetarian recipes (it’s easy for me to fill up on roasted veggies and big salads, not so much for the kids). This batch lasts us two meals - once with noodles, maybe half zoodles, and the second round on toast or english muffins with cheese melted on top, like a pizza sort of thing? It freezes well and is great to deliver to new parents. CAULIFLOWER BOLOGNESE Serves 6Ingredients2 Tbsp. of extra virgin olive oil1 small yellow onion - roughly chopped3 cloves of garlicsea salt to tastepepper to taste1 head of cauliflower (about ¾ lb. or 12 oz. riced)1/2 cup of raw walnuts pieces1/2 tsp. of Italian seasoning1/2 tsp. of fennel seeds - crushed2 Tbsp. of tomato paste2 Tbsp. of balsamic vinegar1/2 cup of red wine (or broth of any sort, and double the vinegar to mimic the wine’s acidity)28 oz. of canned, crushed tomatoes1/2 cup of red lentilsred pepper flake to tasteFor serving12 oz. of pasta or choice, zoodles, etc.parmesanfresh, torn basilDirectionsIn a large Dutch-oven or stockpot, heat the olive oil over medium low heat.In a food processor, pulse the onion and garlic into smaller bits. Add them to the pot with a big pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté to soften, about 3 minutes.Pulse up the cauliflower florets to get a rice-like texture. Add the riced-cauliflower to the pot and sauté to soften, about 5 minutes.Pulse the walnuts in the processor and add those to the pot along with the Italian seasoning, fennel seed, another few generous pinches of salt and pepper, tomato paste and balsamic vinegar. Sauté until fragrant.Add the red wine, cook about 3 minutes, then add the crushed tomatoes, ½ cup water, lentils, pinch of pepper flakes and stir to combine. Turn the heat to low, put the cover ajar and let it simmer gently for 30-35 minutes. Turn off the heat, taste for seasoning and adjust.Cook your pasta or zoodles according to instructions.

    "description": "While more rich than our everyday fare, this year needs a Christmas breakfast to top all Christmas breakfasts. We will be making the cinnamon rolls from our Sprouted Kitchen Holidays ebook (gifting half because what better door drop is there). We have made cinnamon rolls the tradition, but everyone is ready for something more substantial after presents. So we’re trying this this year - a bread pudding meets frittata and can be tinkered with all sorts of ways to taste. I’ve now made a mediterranean version with artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes and feta, or a roasted squash and kale take that I made in smaller little ramekins so it felt like a special dinner. If you’re feeding kids? Try getting the vegetables smaller, so they are harder to pick out and the texture sort of blends in.Emmi Gruyere is a great option here because it has a nutty, assertive flavor and also a melty quality to it. Goes so well with mushrooms and the bread makes this a one-dish wonder. We’ve been adding the cheese to the kids grilled cheese sandwiches and into mashed potatoes. Check the store locator for where to find it near you. Thank you for supporting sponsored work on the blog! This post is in partnership with Emmi Roth Cheese, though all words and opinions are my own. Mushroom, Leek and Gruyere StrataServes 6This can take so many different combinations! I left it vegetarian, but some browned breakfast sausage or crispy bacon can be stirred in as well with no other changes should you like. Everything can be assembled the night before and left covered in the fridge overnight. Pull it out first thing in the morning while the oven is preheating and you can enjoy your family instead of working in the kitchen Christmas morning.Gluten Free? We have made this successfully with gluten-free sandwich bread! Ingredients8 oz. fresh bread, cubed (country loaf, French, ciabatta)1 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil1 Tbsp. butter8 oz. mixed mushrooms, stemmed and sliced2 small/1 large leek, white and light green parts, cleaned and sliced4 oz. baby spinach8 eggs1 ½ cup whole milk½ cup cream½ tsp. sea salt1/2 tsp. Fresh ground pepper½ tsp. Dried oregano1 Tbsp. hot sauce1 heaping cup/6 oz. grated Emmi Gruyere, shreddedFresh parsley, for garnishDirectionsPreheat the oven to 375’. Spread the cubed bread on a baking dish and toast for 10 minutes until golden on the edges and dried out. Heat the oil and butter in a large, oven-proof skillet or cast iron pan (about 12”). Add the mushrooms and leeks, a big pinch of salt and pepper and sauté to soften. About 8 minutes. Stir in the baby spinach, turn off the heat, and let it just wilt and cool down. Stir in the toasted bread.While the vegetables cool down, whisk up your egg mixture. In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs, milk, cream, salt, pepper, dried oregano, hot sauce and whisk really well to combine. We want to get some air in there. Stir in the gruyere. Pour the egg mixture over the vegetables, pressing the bread pieces down a bit so they get the custard on all parts. Leave it to soak at room temperature for an hour, or covered, overnight in the refrigerator. Turn the oven down to 350’. Bake on the middle rack for 30 minutes, or until you shake the pan and the center is no longer liquid. A little jiggle is ok, it will set as it cools down. Garnish the top with fresh parsley and serve warm.

    "description": "We made another ebook! Sprouted Kitchen Holidays is a collection of a handful of my favorite recipes from SK Cooking Club, plus a few more, and we made a beautiful online resource for your seasonal table. There are 25 recipes that feel good for celebrating, regardless that this year will be different than any other. Check the link to the shop page for more details and reach out if there are any questions! I am including the recipe for our family tradition of Christmas morning cinnamon rolls here. They have a little bit of baked sweet potato in them to keep them tender, but are by all means decadent. You can start these the day before, and let them sit in the fridge overnight, and the early bird pulls them out while the oven preheats Christmas morning. I’ve also heard they freeze well! Once you cut and load them in your baking dish, cover them with a layer of parchment paper and freeze. The evening before, leave them on the counter at room temperature to thaw and proof, before baking the following morning. We have a post coming up next week for the savory crowd, albeit just as creamy and delicious, before we all take a sharp turn into kale and salads come January. The ebook is available in the shop, and should you need a virtual gift, or want to sync up your menu with someone you cannot be with the holiday, there is a gift option as well. Thank you for your support of all things Sprouted Kitchen, and wishing you wellness into the new year. Sweet Potato Cinnamon RollsServes 8-10I can often makes swaps for gluten-free baked goods, but not here. I don’t know the science of gluten and yeast. The dairy however, can be replaced with a vegan butter and non-dairy milk of choice. If the sweet potato step here sounds fussy, 1/4 cup canned pumpkin puree will do the trick.Heads up! Start these the day before you need to bake them! Ingredients For the dough 1 cup of warm milk (no warmer than 110°) 2 1/2 tsp. of active dry yeast 2 eggs 1/3 cup of unsalted butter - melted1/3 cup of cooked sweet potatoes flesh 1/2 tsp. of sea salt 1/3 cup of cane sugar 4 1/2 cups of all purpose flour, divided For the filling 1 cup of light brown sugar 2 Tbsp. of cinnamon1/3 cup of unsalted butter - room temp 1/2 cup of chopped pecans - optional For the frosting 4 oz. of cream cheese 3 Tbsp. of unsalted butter 1/4 cup of maple syrup 3/4 cup of powdered sugar 1 tsp. of vanilla extract pinch of sea salt Directions Warm the milk (not super hot, just above body temp.). Stir in the yeast and let it sit for a few minutes to dissolve. Into a stand mixer with knead attachment, add the milk mixture, eggs, incorporate them in well. Stir in the butter, potato flesh, salt and sugar to combine. Add 4 1/4 cups of the flour, 1 cup at a time, reserve the last 1/4 cup for rolling them out. Work everything together to combine for a minute, then dump the dough on a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough by pushing it with the heels of your hands and pulling it back to you on repeat for about 5 minutes. Roll it into a smooth little dough baby, cover it with a dish towel or plastic wrap and let it rise until it doubles in size. This time of year, since it’s a little chillier, this will take no less than an hour, likely two. Go do something else and just leave it alone. While you’re waiting, stir the brown sugar, cinnamon and butter together. It should look like a thick paste. Roll the dough out into a 1/4” thick rectangle, about 14” in length. No need to bust out a ruler, just guess. Spread the brown sugar butter mixture all across the top. Sprinkle pecan or walnut pieces in there if you like nuts. Starting with the long side, roll the dough down into a log. Cut the log into roughly 3” thick pieces (you can make them smaller or larger to your preference). Arrange them with an inch of space between in one or two greased baking dishes. I don’t need 14 rolls for just my family, so I bake half in a 10” cast iron skillet and put the rest in a second baking dish to gift). (This much can be done a day in advance and leave them covered in the fridge. Whomever wakes up first in the morning, should pull them from the fridge so they can rest and rise for at least one hour before baking. You can also freeze them, and pull them out to the counter when you go to bed the evening prior to wanting to bake them) Cover the rolls loosely with a dish towel and let them rise another hour. Preheat the oven to 350°. Bake the rolls on the middle rack for 20 minutes. While the rolls bake, whip up your frosting. In a stand mixer or with an electric mixer (or by hand with your strong muscles), mix the cream cheese and butter together until well combined and smooth (about 5 minutes in a stand mixer). Add the maple, powdered sugar, vanilla and pinch of salt and mix again. While the rolls are still warm but not piping hot, spread the frosting across the top and let it drip into the crannies. Enjoy warm!

    "description": "The internet is a hottttt place right now, so I’ll just pretend we’re catching up on the porch, sharing a glass of wine and updating you on the bits and bobs of our little life. Like a Christmas letter in October?Curran is back at school and albeit strange and distanced, he’s so happy. He loves wearing his face shield with the mask as well so he looks extra cautious and also like a stormtrooper and I just love how he marches to his own drum. He’s been in skateboard class, still obsessed with the ocean and his Dad and food in general. Cleo has been tough lately. Lots of big feelings and big reactions and if I don’t get some break from her drama before she is a teenager? Lord help us. She learned the word “shit” from The Chicks new album, which she requests every time we get in the car. I told her it was a really bad word for poop which unfortunately makes it more intriguing for that 4-6 age range. My bad. When she is happy, she has tons of personality, affectionate, a great sense of humor and pays attention to detail and is therefore quite thoughtful. She LOVES Curran, and that bond may be my favorite thing about being a parent. Work is steady-ish. A few speed bumps (actually a really big one) which I’ll tell you more about when I know more. I’m pretty creatively toasted, but I feel grateful to have a job and the schedule we do in the current state of things. We’re trying to turn over a holiday ebook in a few weeks so if we can pull it off, that will be exciting. I love love my new nephew! New babies are so clean and cuddly and seeing my sister and brother-in-law adjust into parenting is both nostalgic and beautiful. I do think it’s a stunning metamorphosis of a person, and tender to watch of people you care for so deeply. I’m reading Small Great Things by Jodi Piccoult. Looking for an easy, local-ish place to go for our 10-year wedding anniversary next month. That’s the short of it for now. Lots of things and feelings going on for so many right now. Always in pursuit of good company and real conversation. I hope you are finding slivers of that. This recipe has been popular over on SKCC, so I thought it should live here too. We use a mix of legumes, some bulgur for texture. Your favorite broth or stock, homemade if you’re fancy. I do stir kale in at the end because I like my veggie chili to indeed, be full of vegetables, and I’m sure some real chili conisseurs would consider that a disgrace. It’s 2020! Live your life. Our favorite way to serve this is over extra crispy roasted sweet potato tots. The brand Alexia makes our favorites, speaking from tot fans over here. Or over a baked and split potato in general, makes this meal so filling and easy to prep ahead. As it goes with chili and stews, the toppings are crucial. Don’t skip those!We’re on the tail end of outdoor dinner season in CA and I swear by stews and chilis being an excellent meal to feed to friends. This soup is a favorite. Because I will forever encourage feeding others, pandemic or not, maybe you can pull off a drive-way pumpkin carving next week? Chili for all? That’s on our calendar. Wishing you wellness and warm bowls of something delicious. VEGGIE CHILIServes 6I wrote this recipe for SKCC, and it’s been popular. Even the omnivorous folks say they don’t miss the meat because there is enough flavor and texture going on. I’ve been refilling my spice jars with dry spices from Thrive Market (if you use that link, you get a discount on your first order!). They are affordable and fresh. While you’re there and filling up your cart for free shipping, you can buy beans, grains, tomato products etc. and you’ll have pantry staples on hand for this chili at all times. Speaking of omnivores, there has been reported success in adding a pound of ground chicken/turkey/beef to this recipe. Add it to the pot to brown and cook through after the vegetables, and add 2 more cups broth to keep everything hydrated. This will increase the serving yield to 6-8, and if that’s too much, this gifts and freezes well.

Heat the avocado oil. Get chopping, my friend!To the pot, add the onions, jalapeño, mushrooms and a big pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté those down for about 10-15 minutes until water is released and the mushrooms begin to brown. We really want to cook the water off here. Add the bell peppers, sweet potato, garlic and sauté about 5 minutes until the just begin to soften.Add the chili powder, cumin, cocoa, smoked paprika, and chipotle to the pot and sauté them for another minute. Add the lentils, bulgur, tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, broth, beer or coffee and coconut aminos. Bring everything to a gentle simmer, uncovered, and let it all cook for about 35 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the lentils and bulgur are cooked through. Add the black beans, corn, and kale if using, taste for seasoning and adjust as needed. More salt? Maybe more coconut aminos. Spicier? Add more chipotle or chili powder. Let it all simmer another 10 minutes to warm through and wilt the greens.Serve your bowls with a generous amount of toppings. Chili will keep for a week in the fridge.

    "description": "We’re obsessed with this cauliflower. I’ve made it three times in the last week for different people and it reports back as the favorite dish. Every brand of tahini varies in texture. I find the 365 Whole Foods brand to work well here because it’s naturally quite runny. If you need a visual, albeit on super speed, I made a Reel over on Instagram so you can see how easy this is! TAHINI GLAZED ROASTED CAULIFLOWERServes 4I’ve served this as a side with some lamb meatballs and quinoa salad, but is is a great side for just about anything. Veg friends, it is filling and textured and honestly if you just want a bowl of this on top of some greens as a meal, that works too. It is best eaten fresh out of the oven, but can be reheated as needed, it will just absorb most of the tahini coat. Fresh herbs forever. Don’t skip the parsley and mint. Ingredients1 large head of cauliflower3 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil1 Tbsp. champagne or white wine vinegar1 tsp. coriander1 tsp. sea salt1/4 tsp. cayenne or aleppo, to tastefresh ground pepper2 shallots, peeled and cut in wedges4 dates, pitted and chopped smallTAHINI GLAZE1/4 cup tahini1 Tbsp. olive oil or sesame oil1 Tbsp. maple syrup2 Tbsp. lemon juice2 Tbsp. watersalt and pepper3 Tbsp. fresh chopped parsley2 Tbsp. toasted sesame seeds, for garnish1 bundle of mint, leaves removed and roughly chopped DirectionsPreheat the oven to 425’. Pull out a large rimmed baking sheet. Cut the florets away from the core, and break them into smallish, 2x2” florets. Drizzle the olive oil, vinegar, coriander, sea salt, cayenne/aleppo and toss everything with your hands to coat. Spread it in an even layer on the baking sheet and roast for 15 minutes. Pull it out, turn the heat down to 400’, add the shallots, toss everything around again so the shallots get some oil and seasoning on them, and pop the tray back in to roast for another 20 minutes. While you’re waiting, chop up your dates into small pieces. Stir together the tahini glaze ingredients. It should look pretty thin, like a thicker salad dressing. Adjust with water, oil or lemon to get that consistency. Thickness of tahini varies by brand. Pull the tray out of the oven, and while still hot, add the dates and toss them in. Add the tahini glaze and parsley to the warm pan and toss everything until all the tahini has coated the cauli. Transfer to your serving bowl and sprinkle with the sesame seeds and mint. Look at you go!

    "description": "For my sister (and maybe my 6-years-ago self, too…)I know you guys are so ready for this. You’ve been ready, the road to get here has been a little twisty and I CANNOT wait to be moms together. Just giddy about it. Let’s start there. We were a few days home from the hospital with Curran, and it had set in that maybe this was going to be harder than I thought. A big transition. My body torn up and my nipples chapped and the gut-wrenching worry that this teensy thing may just stop breathing or any number of tragic things that now feel like cold possibilities. A thoughtful friend mailed a note and I’ll never forget the perfect timing from an experienced mother. I still keep it in Curran’s keepsake journal. The note reminded me that I was capable - that I was made to be this child’s mother amidst the overwhelming exhaustion and newness of it all. Motherhood is such a wild cocktail of elation and… grief maybe? I don’t intend to be dramatic, but your life is never the same. You think about and prepare for this transition for months, sometimes years, and there is no accurate description that will touch on how you feel the second you look at that baby. You rebirth yourself in that moment as well. You’ve known great love, but nothing like this. It fills a corner of your heart you didn’t even know was there. That smell! His skin! Those itsy bitsy toes! Seeing your husband hold his tiny body to his chest. It’s out of body, really. So out of body, that sometimes you feel untethered. The emotions, the physical healing, being responsible for that small life, getting through the day… it’s a lot! You feel so many things in the course of a day. In the course of a moment. It is both the best, most tender job AND so effing hard. All day. Every day. You will second guess your own intuition and also find how to truly trust yourself outside of google and other opinions. There is a lot of chatter about diapers and organic sheets and the best baby wash but there is a quieter murmur about the metamorphosis that occurs as a woman becomes a mother. That metamorphosis seems to be life- long, far as I can tell, as the caring for these little people grows and changes. My experience may be nothing like yours. What worked for me or what I struggled with or when my babies slept or what bottle they liked may not matter at all come your turn. I find that all that unknowing and problem solving and figuring and filtering through noise, is what builds your own confidence as a parent. Pilfering through the shoulds and suggestions, to make choices that work for you and your family. You are his mom and the best person for the job. Believe that this very moment! You have support all around you.I want to pass on to you, just like that well timed note did for me, the affirmation that this role is yours, and you are absolutely capable. You are everything he needs. This mom business is immeasurably valuable work.Let people help. Drink lots of water. Find your pockets of relief. Your body will heal. It will pass. Tomorrow is a new day. Sleep does return. And it’s just like every old lady tells you at the market on your most frustrating of days… it goes so fast. xoLove you so dearly, my sister. Happy to be on this wild ride with you. xo—I heard from many of you looking for a list of recipes to stock up on, or gift, to those in the new baby season. Here are the condensed, top suggestions, in order of most repeated via my instagram question. I will start a series here “Food for New Parents,” per request, so these sorts of recipes are easy to find on the site.

I keep it stored in the fridge, and spoon it on top of lettuce with a little more vinaigrette when ready to eat. I’ve also packed it in a tortilla or stirred in some cooked brown rice to make it more filling. It will dry as it sits, so add a drizzle of oil and vinegar if it needs a refresh.

    "description": "We planned this trip pre-pandemic. It got rescheduled three times and by the time we were actually going, I didn’t think the four of us needed any more time with each other. The kids had been extra bickery and Cleo had been a bit of a loose cannon and Hugh and I, who run a tight web of work/love/family life all together, all the time, had been feeling like all the margin and space had been sucked out of that web since March. But I also needed out. I needed new. Turns out we all did, and we liked each other more, in a different space. That’s the take away - GET OUT!Here we all are in our first trip together to Yosemite National Park. We stayed at Autocamp - a charming airstream resort of trailers about 45 minutes from the parks entrance. Yes, I did get a trade discount, no, this is not sponsored but I wish it was because I want to go back already. The kids LOVED it. It was perfect for their age and I appreciated the detail that no cars were allowed inside the camp area so they could run free and I didn’t need to worry about that. They were convinced we’d see climbers working their way up the face of El Cap (thank you, Free Solo on Netflix) and I was ready for some scenery that was not within the 15 mile radius of our home. I’ve lived in California my whole life and this was my first visit to Yosemite.  Hitting the road and landing somewhere so magical was really something. Sure, there were still meltdowns and miscommunications but it felt like a real break from our day to day. It was obviously breathtaking (these photos!!) but also the shake up that we all needed.  View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize I shared some photos on instagram of Autocamp, the Airstream trailer glamping place we stayed and many of you asked for a review, so I’ll log a few thoughts here for reference. We have tent camped and car camped but found it immeasurably easier to drive up to an equipped trailer with a pool on the property and mini kitchen set-up. I know this convenience comes at an expense, and especially with young kids (mine 4.5 and 6 at the time), I would absolutely pay for this again so long as I am able. It cut the prep and clean up significantly. We stayed in one of the Accessible Suites which had a nice porch area and more space inside for all four of us. When we go back, would be fun to sync up with a few families and book trailers together. The airstream trailers looked great too, and by the looks of the layout, I would suggest to get one that is up the hill from the lobby, not down. There just seemed to be a little more space and a nicer view from some. It is located in Midpines, where there is not much going on. Do not go without a Yosemite park pass. I mean there is a bus/shuttle but especially with the kids and gear for the day, having the car was important. Food options and markets in Midpines are limited, so if you go planning to do take-out, know that there truly isn’t much and what is there, isn’t great. We didn’t have a pass into the park the first day, and thought we’d find hikes in the area and didn’t find much. We took a drive into Bass Lake, about an hour away, and spent some time at the pool. The drive into the park is beautiful and we didn’t mind it. Listened to this audio book and loved it. You all also asked for my food plan, so you could have easy ideas. I cook all the time, I did not feel obligated to woo my family with impressive camp cuisine. We kept things simple. I’ll link to some of these recipes, but know many come from SK Cooking Club, where recipes and bundles can be purchased a la carte if you are not a monthly subscriber. If anything, I just hope it gives you ideas.

No gluten? Use a gluten-free all-purpose flour like Bob’s Red Mill or Cup for Cup. No dairy? Use almond milk with a small squeeze of lemon juice and coconut oil as replacements. No eggs? They won’t have as much lift, but a small, mashed, overripe banana will help them hold. This makes a lot of pancakes. Leftovers pack well in lunchboxes with a swipe of nut or seed butter, or the dry and wet mixes can be easily halved, so this can cover you for two mornings.

Add the buttermilk or alternative, oil or butter, and continue to whisk to combine. Add all of the dry mix (if you're halving things, use half the wet ingredients as well) and fold them in just until just combined. Do not overmix! Want to stir in chocolate chips or blueberries?

    "description": "There is more to say on this subject, and this will be clunky and too much and not enough but I need to start somewhere, even just for me. I started this blog over 11 years ago as of writing this post, and if I look at my past writing, both the personal parts and how I wrote recipes, I can mark my own growth in both areas. I hope to always stay in motion of learning and listening, even when I disagree, if only so I may better understand my own thoughts and beliefs, and have compassion for all sorts of perspectives. These last few months have woken up so many of us - gosh, I mean that to be interpreted in all sorts of ways. I see how many of our existing systems are still oppressive, even quietly so. I am reading and listening and participating in an Actively Anti-Racist learning group, and understanding more completely that being “nice” has not been enough. I will never understand or have the experience, as a white woman, to speak as an authority on this subject. My privilege has been surrounded by a lot of other privilege, and I have work to do to shift from, as well as within that. I will be the first to admit that up to this point, my advocacy has been quiet and passive, which actually serves nobody. I believe in caring for people and community and inclusion, but the diversity and amplification of black chefs and allyship towards fair farming and food systems has been lacking here. I apologize for ways I have appropriated recipes from other cultures without researching and crediting appropriately first, or have used language that came off as exclusive, as much of the health and wellness themes can give off. What initially felt like drinking from a fire hose, has been met with starting somewhere. We have been going through Brit Barron’s Understanding Racism 101 and if you are looking for a place to start, I would highly recommend her work. My education up to this point has been through podcasts (I loved this recent one from Brene Brown), which is a good base, but gosh there are so many folks to learn from and books to read. I am also currently reading White Fragility, and have I’m Still Here and Between the World and Me in the queue- there are lists all over the interwebs. I bought more books for the kids, such as Sulwe, Little Leaders and Fearless Trailblazers, as we have more experience within the Latino community where we live and there is anti-racist work to be done there as well. I mean none of this to be performative, and gosh, it’s a small start, but I have found these resources because others have shared them with me, so I am putting them here to pass them on.I want complacency to be something I look back on as a point I grew forward from - like the Maya Angelou quote, “once you know better, do better.” I commit to being humble, brave and vulnerable; and in my own self-awareness, be moved towards action to change the conversation. I’m glad you are here and I appreciate educated and compassionate discourse on different subjects. Looking forward to learning and growing and saying the wrong thing sometimes, so that I may learn to do better the next time. To potatoes…because how does one transition well here?The green sauce is one of dozens of sauces we’ve featured over on SKCC. What used to be subscription based, is now open for a la carte purchases, and bundles of favorited recipes based on different themes. You can now purchase bundles for a shot of recipe inspiration without having to commit to a subscription. Make an account on sproutedkitchen.cc and it should be easy to navigate from there. One of the most versatile bundles is the Sauce \u0026 Condiment Bundle, where we’ve been storing favorites that really can be used for so many meals. Pictured here is the Green Herb Sauce, a sister favorite, the Green Harissa, made with lemon instead of lime juice, would also be great. The Green Goddess in that group is also excellent with potatoes, just serve it on the side instead of brushing it all over the top. SMASHED POTATOESServes 4-62 lbs. is generous for 4 people, but moderate for 6, so depends what else you’re serving and what kind of eaters you have. I use baby Yuokns, but fingerlings work as well. They’ll need a few minutes less of a preboil as they are typically smaller. If you are not interested in making a green sauce, brushing them with a little bit of oil and vinegar after baking gives them a little more of a glisten for serving. Potatoes like a post bake bath in a little dressing. Why are we mixing oils? Because the smoke point of olive oil is low, but I prefer it’s flavor to the high-heat oils. So we’re mixing them. Ingredients2 lbs. baby Yukons1 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil2 Tbsp. grapeseed or avocado oil1 1/2 tsp. coarse sea salt1 tsp. paprika1 tsp. garlic powder1 tsp. dried oregano2 oz. grated parmesan cheese1 small bundle Italian parsley, well chopped, for garnishGreen Herb SauceDirectionsPut the potatoes in a pot and cover them with water. Bring the water to a gentle boil and leave them on a gentle boil for about 10-15 minutes, or until you can pierce through a medium sized potato with a paring knife. Drain and cool to the touch - at least 15 minutes.Line a rimmed baking tray with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 425’. Spread the potatoes out and use the bottom of a heavy jar or glass to push down on the potatoes to smash them. Don’t push down all the way, or you’ll over smash them, you want to push about halfway. If you keep busting through them or this step sounds annoying, simply slice the potatoes in halves and quarters for a more tailored looking tot. Drizzle both oils over the tops, along with the salt, paprika, garlic powder, and oregano. Gently toss the potatoes around to get seasoning and oil on all sides. We want them oiled and seasoned liberally! Add more if needed. A bit of breakage is ok. Roast the potatoes for 25 minutes, flipping halfway through. Pull them out, heat up to 500’, sprinkle the parm, and pop them back into the oven for another two minutes just to melt the cheese. While the potatoes roast, make your green sauce. Just out of the oven, brush the green sauce all over the potatoes, and sprinkle fresh herbs. Serve warm.

    "description": "Phew. I used to use this space as a public journal, like old school blogger days plus a recipe, but I still don’t have words yet. That is ok. Most mornings I wake up in the morning, Hugh brings me coffee so I can check my emails and read the news, which as of late, isn’t a great way to start the day. I do it anyway, and sometimes I just cry. I cry for people who are loosing loved ones and not even getting to say goodbye, for medical professionals who do not have the gear they need - who are also getting sick and have to go to work scared of such risk. I cry about SO many who have lost jobs, who cannot work at home with their kids there full time better yet homeschool them, or those who are uncomfortable at home even on good days, who have had retirements wiped out or are in the midst of chemo or pregnant and scared to death of catching the virus. This is all BIG, and I feel so much in the span of a day, I can’t pin it down to paper. Day at a time. Hour by hour. Check in on your people. Send cards or a text or a funny meme. Drink in the good moments and get outside when things feel like too much a try to wait until 3pm for happy hour. That is how we take the days so far. Most of my work is focused on dinner plans. I always make more than we need, and since my husband and I work from home, we usually eat leftovers for lunches. Due to current circumstances, I’m getting lots of questions from you all about lunch ideas. Everyone is home and everyone is eating allllllll day long! I made this quinoa dish last week and thought I’d put notes here. I’ve written similar things before and it’s super easy, but it doesn’t sound like many of us have the bandwidth or grocery trips to get fussy right now. A week of lunchesEggs Gribiche On asparagus as written, on toast, plain with crackers, smashed between a tender bun etc. Fried Egg SandwichesToasted English muffin, fried egg, crispy bacon or not, arugula, avocado sauce Chicken Tender TacosHoping you have crispy chicken tenders or fish sticks in your freezer? We have some simple homemade ones in SK Little Sprouts! A swipe of refried beans, hot sauce, and another reason to make the aforementioned avocado sauce!Tortellini with Creamy Spinach SauceReheats easily. Add some cooked chicken sausage if you want more protein, or baby tomatoes if your people are into that. Roasted Vegetable OrzoThis includes more summery vegetables but I think you could riff with springy things - peas, leeks, asparagus.Heidi’s Quinoa PattiesThis recipe makes SO many. Halve it or freeze some. You can sub in half cauli rice for the quinoa yield and they still work, or add in some thawed, frozen spinach into the mixture to get in some extra greens. You can eat them plain with a sauce or put them on hawaiian rolls for the kiddos. Beach Day Tuna SaladPacked with herbs and golden raisins and lots of mustard from our first cookbook. Obv I think you should buy our cookbook (which feels vintage at this point) but riffed and revised because I love you:2 (5-ounce) cans water-packed tuna, drained + ¼ cup golden raisins + 2 celery stalks, tiny dice + 1/4 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley + 1 tablespoon whole grain mustard + 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard + 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice + 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or good-quality mayonnaise + generous season of salt and freshly ground pepperSturdy whole grain crackers, for dippingGoodness WrapsThis does sound like a few steps, but make batches of the insides then you can repeat them many times! Also great in bowl form. Snack Plates!Yes, that is an exclamation. Breathe life into what is chopped things on a plate. My kids love things arranged in color coordinated groups and I like to take a meal off. We love the Simple Mills Almond Crackers, (also at costco), hummus or guacamole, thin coins of cucumber and carrots, berries, nuts, raisins, cheese and salami for those who want it. It’s a meal! GREEK QUINOA SALAD WITH OLIVE DRESSINGServes 4-6*For perfect quinoa, rinse it in a mesh strainer. 1 cup quinoa to 1.5 cups broth or seasoned water. Bring it to a simmer. Cover, turn the heat to low and cook for 15 minutes until the liquid is mostly absorbed. Fluff it with a fork. Turn off the heat, leave the cover ajar and let it sit in there for another 10 minutes to finish fluffing, or uncover and cool down completely for the salad below. The dressing is thick from all the olives, but once it’s distributed in the quinoa, it works out. Add a splash more oil and vinegar if you prefer. The whole situation will absorb the dressing as it sits in the fridge. DirectionsCook and cool your quinoa. Chop all your vegetables and herbs. Put everything, besides the cheese, in a large mixing bowl. Stir the dressing ingredients together. Pour them over the salad and toss everything to mix. Season to taste. Add the cheese, give it all one more stir. Store the salad in the fridge for up to five days. Serve it over greens, alone, with chicken or fish etc. Ingredients2 cups cooked quinoa*2 Persian/1 english cucumbers, seeded, tiny dice3 Tbsp. minced shallot1 cup diced tomatoes1 red bell pepper, cored, tiny dice1 bundle of mint, chopped1/2 bundle of parsley, chopped3 ounces. crumbled feta cheesefor the Olive Dressing2/3 cup olive tapenade or well chopped olives1 garlic clove, grated3 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil2 Tbsp. red wine vinegar2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juicedried oreganosalt and pepper",

    "description": "Hi loves! I’m making this on insta live today (2 pm PST) if for some reason you read this prior, and I wanted to post the full recipe here as well. This was a member favorite from SK Cooking Club, and given the current circumstances, I figured it belonged here as well. I know everyone is trying to limit grocery runs, but I think we can make this work. Some members did half cauli, half chicken. Another mentioned she did sweet potatoes and broccoli into the sauce. If you don’t have tomato paste, you can use a can of crushed tomatoes or even tomato sauce and it’ll work. I know there are more details to true, authentic tikka masala but now does not feel like the time for details? Let me know if you have questions!I hope you are well. Feeding ourselves and our people is one of the most anchoring acts we have right now. I wish you wellness!CAULIFLOWER TIKKA MASALA // Serves 4Tikka is a takeout favorite but can often be so heavy. Since we have some dairy-free folks we swapped out the yogurt and cream with full fat coconut milk. We have tested this with both chicken and cauli, so you can adapt it to your family’s preference.To swap chicken for cauli, repeat the same method of seasoning the chicken as you would the cauliflower with a third of the spice blend. Cut 1 ½ lbs. of boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs into 1” cubes, toss in the spice blend, and brown in batches, over medium heat, until golden on all sides. Remove from the pan, set aside, and continue with your sauce. Once the sauce has thickened to your liking, add in the browned chicken and allow to simmer in the sauce for 10 minutes until cooked through.INGREDIENTS2 Tbsp. yellow curry powder1 ½ tsp. cumin1 tsp. paprika1 tsp. turmeric1 tsp. coriander¼ tsp. allspice or cinnamon½ tsp. red pepper flakes, or more to taste1 ½ tsp. kosher salt2 Tbsp. avocado oil, divided1 large head cauliflower, cut into florets 1 medium yellow onion, diced5 cloves garlic, grated1 Tbsp. freshly grated ginger 1 6 oz. can tomato paste¾ cup low-sodium vegetable stock1 14 oz. can full fat coconut milkzest and juice of 1 small lemonGenerous handful well chopped cilantro2 cup cooked basmati, brown, or cauli rice, for serving¼ cup salted, toasted cashewsnaan, optionalyogurt, optionalDIRECTIONSPreheat oven to 425.’In a small bowl, mix together curry, cumin, paprika, turmeric, coriander, cinnamon/allspice, red pepper flakes, and salt. On a rimmed baking sheet, arrange cauli florets so there is space between them, drizzle with a tablespoon of avocado oil and toss with about a third of the spice mix. Transfer to the oven and roast for 30 minutes until just browned and tender.Meanwhile, make your sauce. In a large Dutch oven, heat the remaining oil over medium. When the oil is shimmering, add in the onion and cook until golden, about 4 minutes. Add in garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant. Once the veg are golden and tender, add in the remaining spice blend, stir, and let the spices toast for an additional 2 minutes. Add in the tomato paste, stirring to combine. Slowly pour in coconut milk, broth, and bring the sauce to a low boil.Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium low, and allow to simmer and thicken for 5 minutes, until the sauce is creamy and coats the back of a spoon. Using an immersion blender or blender, puree the sauce until smooth. You can leave it chunky, but we all liked it smooth. Transfer the sauce back to the pot, add in the cauli, lemon juice, and zest, and stir gently to combine. To serve, fill bowls with a generous scoop of rice, the cauli mixture, cilantro, toasted cashews, and a squeeze of lemon.",

I need to buy dried cranberries. Full Moon this week! It was a doozy. Moved things around. Morning mediation next to the coffee machine. \u003c| O ] This version had more arugula. Where I do my daily check in. Added frozen berries to my yogurt. Waching an old lathe be restored. Sparkle pony. At my feet at my desk. I like writing your love notes when you buy something from my shop. Rescuing a trim job. The light is starting to shift in the afternoons. Smoosh. Bing! Headed to Santa Rosa. We saw Brian Regan! Late night in the driveway. Lunch with my friend Lisa! It’s been far too long! Walking around Pt. Richmond This shop was weird! Creeeeepy. More creepyness. Coffee chats. Hooray for catching up!! Pampas grass popped out of nowhere. Work snack. I have a new favorite pen! I love how it flows! The cat traps are working. Comparing my new hobonichi cousin to this year’s. An old list/color combo I enjoyed. Rainbow spotted. Another one… I am working on my Autumn bucket list today. I love alone time. I love looking at old due dates. I carry this print in my purse. It’s got an important mantra on the back for me to remember.

Fig season is my favorite. Catching up in my hobo. Cards this week. Spells. Hash brown buns on a salad. Thrift selfie. Thrifted jacket! Postal visit. Magic maker. Looking through old journals. This was a good dinner. Help yourself to my basket. Mom’s tacos. Morning meditation. House geometry. Kitchen real life. Adult lunchables from my prep. Trip with MC to visit Charlotte’s new shop. We left with mini bouquets. Garden harvest. Putting it to good use. Morning scramble. Hike with Lisa. The approach. Moon check. Making something with these. Prep station. The light has shifted and so have they. Adding details to old entries. Neiley completing her work! Art-decko! Working outside with candlelight. Night plant life. I love how our lights spotlight plants. Art in the shadows. A flower can change a whole week. Things of note. Going sticker crazy. My grandma made this. A pretty surprise. Hiking with my Uncle. The patina. Checking in with light sources. Magic lenses. Magic wedge.

    "description": "Here’s what this past week looked like- My Everyday Life Week 36 SF Photo adventure day (labor day) with Reese, Ronnie, Marco \u0026 Jasper! Our goal was to shoot film (which I need to develop!) and play with cameras. I brought my Fuji XT3 and gave myself a challenge to shoot only double exposure with it. It made me remember how much of my life was shot in horizontal before Pinterest came out. This is from my camera phone. We went on a long walk in the city. Bubbles were involved. Reflections of who we used to be. I was fascinated by the xxxxx I saw. Marco captured me capturing! Double exposure for the win. Hi Reese! I like what happens in your beard on the right. I’m also glad you wore that shirt. Double Jasper. Marco vs. plant. Pull it, Ronnie. Teachers teaching. I can’t wait to see the film on this one. Filtered. Impromptu STOP En route. At the De Young. Stopping for lunch. Stay away from geese. Pretending we are in a pool. Watching turtles and a heron. In the SF Botanical Garden. Thanks for the shot, Marco!! Autumn is soon! Huggles says no pics. The angle of this spider web though. This was diet food growing up. I love it as an adult and don’t think of it that way even when I make it in the same kitchen. I tried to make banana oat cookies with raisins instead of dates. Didn’t work out as well! Still ate them though. Made fish at my uncle’s house! Babybel cheese wax is the ultimate fidget tool. Yum. Monthly printable came in strong! I tracked all my workouts this month! I processed my August pages in my currently workbook on The Handwriting Club! Scribbles in my hobo. How to conjure my MOM. Let the light hit this part in my kitchen. Burn incense, light a candle, and put on Sting. I like Roxanne. She’s around. I conjure her when I’m cleaning. She tells me when I’ve missed spots. And then I realize… I am her and she is me. #keepgriefweird A nice surprise. My garden is full of them this year. I found Rosie at Trader Joe’s. This is Rosie at home. Lighting incense. I’m a sucker for nag champa. Nasturtium sprouts. Recording a new episode of Keep Grief Weird. This came at the right time. BEHOLD. TEA. I like how wild things get around here.

    "description": "I LOVE LISTS Organize with the “Chaos Method.” I want to participate in a cheddar taste test. People posing with their cars in the 1950s + 1960s. 80s \u0026 90s nostalgia. Fall flowering perennials to add to your garden. Japanese handicraft videos are so relaxing. I’m excited Chef’s Table is coming back. Is the white casing on the salami mold? I’m already looking at Halloween costumes… How to find valuable books in thrift stores. This makes me want to go to Japan. This makes me want to cut paper. I want a hidden desk. Martha’s no cook meals. Hotels are ditching mini toiletries. Why American cheese melts better. Why are airplane windows round? Giving myself a mani with this nail polish this weekend. I am excited to start making Autumn Reset Button Salads! Weekend reading: The Artist’s Way This week on Keep Grief Weird we talk about the idea of “Only the Good Die Young.” We discuss parasocial relationships and how public grief can help us talk about GRIEF. We uploaded a video version of the podcast for paid subscribers. Thanks for your support! More of my August pages on The Handwriting Club The post I LOVE LISTS appeared first on Shutterbean.",

    "description": "Here’s what this past week looked like- My Everyday Life Week 35 Neiley captured the loooooove. Mocktail at Lisa’s. Doing art under her oak tree. The Crispy Rice Salad from Sweetgreens is yummy. Leaving with loot. A beautiful bouquet from her garden. And produce! YAY. The light is changing and I’m noticing. This is who I am. Enjoying GF bagels from TJs this week. I had them with their chive cream cheese and tomatoes from my garden. Finding greenery. Tell me you’re a Californian without telling me you’re a Californian. I made my new obsession this week- Banana Oat Cookies. Coworked with MC at the Mill Valley Library. We set up camp in the young adult section. Wore this dress (one of my amazon favorites) to a design party! I am full of it. The LIGHT. And the angels SING. Learning about Quilt climate control at Mill Road Studio Moved over to Lauren’s Studio! Designer friends have good taste. Cute. Didn’t have any. Introvert connects with her light source. Protection spells. Thank you for supporting my small business! The Handwriting Club Found a few feathers this week. Thought about how many people have walked here before me. Ladies. The last push up the hill. Doing some shadow work while I was up there. Golden hour. Ate one on the way into the house. Had this every morning this week. The reflectors made me smile. Hidden messages while thrifting. Ooof. Ain’t that the truth. Another one! Bing! Sol Food Chicken! Date night at the Buckeye. I want more blue cheese in my life. Golden glow.
