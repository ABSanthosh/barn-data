Whether you’re hosting a backyard BBQ, heading to the beach, or just craving an easy long-weekend dinner, these easy Memorial Day recipes are made for warm weather and minimal prep. Think juicy grilled mains, refreshing no-cook sides, and make-ahead desserts that keep things breezy from start to finish. With 30 go-to dishes to choose from, you’ll be set for summer’s first (unofficial) party. Tomato \u0026 Melon Burrata Caprese This Tomato-Cantaloupe Caprese with Burrata is a no-cook summer stunner. Juicy heirloom tomatoes and sweet cantaloupe wedges surround creamy burrata, all drizzled with a lemony herb vinaigrette. It’s a vibrant, refreshing twist on the classic caprese—perfect for warm-weather gatherings. Crudités with Feta-Pistachio Dip Creamy feta and tangy Greek yogurt are enriched with the crunch of pistachios, the freshness of dill, and a hint of mint, creating a refreshing dip that's perfect for dipping seasonal vegetables Hasselback Prosciutto e Melone Hasselback Prosciutto e Melone combines sweet melon and salty prosciutto with a crisp, eye-catching twist. It’s a simple, yet elevated appetizer perfect for any summer spread. Shrimp Cocktail with different sauces This Shrimp Cocktail Trio makes entertaining effortless—just grab pre-cooked shrimp and whip up three simple, flavorful sauces. From classic cocktail to zesty mustard and tangy aioli, these dips bring a showstopping touch with minimal effort. 1. Grilled Corn with Basil Butter The flavors in this quick and easy grilled corn are magically summery: the herby basil butter complements the natural sweetness of the corn, while the char from the grilling adds a nice element of smokiness. 2. Garlicky Roasted Potato Salad This Garlicky Roasted Potato Salad is crispy, golden, and tossed in a punchy, herb-packed dressing. It’s a flavorful twist on the classic that holds up beautifully at outdoor gatherings. 3. Grilled Avocado \"Guacamole\" with Parmesan \u0026 Basil You'll never make guacamole the same way again after trying this version. Grill the avocados before mixing them into this zesty, cheesy spread, which is especially perfect for a backyard BBQ. 4. Our Best Coleslaw What could be more perfect for an outdoor meal than a bright, crunchy coleslaw? This take on the classic BBQ side dish has lots of za'atar, celery seeds, and tangy Greek yogurt. And if you're worried about it getting soggy, as some coleslaws notoriously do, worry not—this one's salted ahead of time, then squeezed before tossing in sauce, so it soaks up all the moisture from the dressing and stays perfectly crunchy for days. 5. Grilled Okra with Sriracha Lime Salt This classic Southern vegetable gets taken in a whole new direction when skewered over the grill and sprinkled with a spicy, tangy Sriracha and lime salt. 6. Grilled Marinated Tomatoes Juicy summer tomatoes really shine in this easy summer appetizer, which calls for a piquant marinade (lime, fish sauce, chili, and shallot) and a quick kiss from the grill. 7. No-Mayo Peperonata Pasta Salad This No-Mayo Peperonata Pasta Salad is bright, tangy, and totally picnic-ready. Roasted peppers and a zippy vinaigrette keep it light but full of flavor. 8. Torn Egg \u0026 Farro Salad Fluffy eggs, perfectly seasoned farro, and a bevy of crunchy, cooling vegetables—what more can you ask for from a salad? This one keeps for days, so make it ahead before you're ready to party, or keep leftovers to enjoy with all the extra burgers throughout the first week of June. 9. Our Best Sweet Potato Fries We like sweet potato fries that are crunchy but not leathery, tender but not oil-soaked, and sweet potato-ey without being too...well...sweet. With the help of Kenji J. López-Alt’s sage advice on frying, we've created a recipe that achieves all those qualities, and then some, while staying fuss-free to boot. These'll go excellently with any of those burgers or skewers below. 10. Halfsies Chicken This no-nonsense chicken recipe is perfect for a big crowd—all you need is five simple ingredients and a bit of planning (you just let the chicken marinate overnight before it hits the grill the next day). 11. J. Kenji López-Alt’s Grilled Shrimp Scampi-ish With Garlic \u0026 Lemon This seemingly simple dish is loaded up with tips for the crispiest, juiciest grilled shrimp out there: air-drying, dry-brining, adding baking soda, and snuggling on the skewers. 12. Flank Steak with Green Sauce As impressive as it is easy to pull together, this tender flank steak can come together in the oven or on the grill, while the chimichurri-esque green sauce needs just a whiz in the food processor. 13. Super-Crispy Chicken Smash Burgers These Super-Crispy Chicken Smash Burgers are golden, crunchy, and packed with flavor—thanks to a quick pan-fry and savory seasoning. Serve them with your favorite sauce and a pile of pickles for the ultimate backyard bite. 14. Alabama-Style Chicken Kebabs What makes something Alabama-style? A \"white\" barbecue sauce, which is tart and tangy with mayo and vinegar, that's famous to the state. 15. Speedy Romeo's Grilled Pizza with Marinated Tomatoes \u0026 Ricotta The key to pulling off this Genius-approved grilled pizza is simple: buy the ripest, freshest, best tomatoes you can find at the farmer's market. 16. Summer Hot Dog Bar Build-your-own hot dogs with all the fixings—this Summer Hot Dog Bar is fun, customizable, and perfect for a crowd. Just set out the buns, dogs, and toppings, and let everyone go wild. 17. Back-Pocket Marinade for Grilled Chicken Two ingredients. About ten seconds. The best chicken marinade you've ever concocted. (Try it on beef, or tofu, or any vegetables of your choosing, too.) 18. Baby Back Ribs with Thai Sweet Chili Sauce These Mekhong-Style Baby Back Ribs are sticky, tender, and full of bold Thai-inspired flavor. Finished with a sweet chili glaze, they’re a guaranteed hit at any cookout. You can make them ahead and transport them in foil. 19. Tangy Baked Salmon With Calabrian Chile If salmon's more your speed, try out this so-simple rendition. It can hang out in the oven while you set out the rest of your party spread (or sip on a michelada—your choice!). 20. Maialino's Olive Oil Cake Bake off this crackle-crusted, extra-moist olive cake the day before the big holiday. That way, all you have to do the day of is slice and serve with fresh fruit and dollops of whipped cream. 21. Banana Pudding Icebox Cake This Banana Pudding Icebox Cake layers cookies, whipped cream, and bananas for a no-bake dessert that’s creamy, nostalgic, and totally irresistible. Perfect for making ahead and chilling until party time. 22. Strawberry Shortcake Ice Cream Pops These nostalgic ice cream pops are just three ingredients—yellow cake crumbles, vanilla ice cream, and finely diced strawberries—and make the most refreshing dessert on a hot summer day. 23. Salty Almond Rhubarb Crisp This Salty Almond Rhubarb Crisp balances tart rhubarb with honey and citrus, topped with a buttery oat and salted almond crumble. It’s a sweet-tart spring dessert that’s easy to prep and even better chilled. 24. Berries-and-Cream Mini Layer Cakes These cute little layer cakes make the perfect personal-size dessert. Finish them off with fresh whipped cream, blueberries, and raspberries for an easy treat that still feels very festive. 26. Margarita A classic for a reason! It's got the perfect mix of bright lime, herbal tequila, sweet orange triple sec, and a slick of salt to cut through it all. Try these on the rocks or blended—with or without fruit, your choice!)—and share with everyone at the BBQ. 26. Michelada Looking for a drink that's savory, refreshing, and totally sessionable? The michelada is just your ticket. Packed with umami (worcestershire sauce! clamato! celery salt on the rim!) and a pleasant fizz (Mexican-style lager works best here), you can pair this drink with any of the snacks in the top section of this recipe guide, or finish out the afternoon quietly while sipping on one. 27. Tea Thyme Soda This non-alcoholic bubbly drink is a riff on your favorite iced black tea, plus an herby-sweet thyme syrup. If you do want to go the cocktail route, though, bourbon fits in here nicely. 28. Big-Batch Matador Cocktail Similar to a margarita, this cocktail for a crowd uses a simple combination of blanco tequila, fresh-squeezed (this is key) pineapple juice, lime juice, and plenty of lime and pineapple wedges for garnish. 29. Watermelonade This sweet, colorful refresher makes the perfect drink for any kids in attendance (although the adults might also like it with a splash of vodka). 30. Red Sangria This red sangria is an absolute must for any hot-weather get-together; mix up all the ingredients (plus any type of fruit you like), let those flavors meld overnight, and serve over ice the next day.
