Unless it’s a burger (she’s all in for burgers), meals between two slices of bread often fall flat. That’s why this week’s plan is all about flexible sandwiches: DIY-style builds, deconstructed options, and satisfying meatless takes that appeal to both kids and grown-ups. Also included: a nostalgic breakfast sandwich inspired by my early 20s, when I helped open a cafe on the North Shore of O‘ahu. It was hearty, rich, and packed with meat-free protein—just how I like to start the day. As always, while the groceries are listed based on what you need, they’re flexible enough to swap based on what you’ve got—especially for things like mayo, hot sauce, or bread.

As always, while the groceries are listed based on what you need, they’re flexible enough to swap based on what you’ve got—especially for things like mayo, hot sauce, or bread. Breakfast Beet Box Breakfast Sammie Dupe — Toasted sourdough or wheat bread with avocado oil veganaise (or regular if that’s your thing), pan-fried smoky tempeh, scrambled eggs, fresh sprouts, salad greens, red onion, and hot sauce. Inspired by my days at the veggie cafe in Hawaii. The closest thing on Food52’s site would be below, modified. Smoky Tempeh \u0026 Hummus Sandwich Add egg and pile it high; feel free to sub hummus for veganaise or mayo. Lunch Deconstructed Sandwich = Charcuterie Lunch Plate — When the toddler won’t commit to a sandwich, I turn the ingredients into a kid-friendly cheese-and-cracker situation: brie, turkey, fruit, nuts, and a little something crunchy. Dinner 1 BBQ Pulled Mushroom Sliders — Meaty mushrooms, saucy BBQ flavor, and soft buns. These are fun to eat, flexible to serve deconstructed, and fully meat-free without sacrificing any richness. Dinner 2 Lamb Meatball Sandwiches with Fennel Slaw \u0026 Feta — Bold, flavorful, and totally family-friendly. The meatballs can be served on their own for picky eaters, or tucked into crusty bread for grown-up satisfaction. Dessert Homemade Ice Cream Sandwiches — A classic, elevated. These soft, chewy cookies sandwich your favorite ice cream flavor—perfect for little hands and nostalgic adults. Make ahead and stash in the freezer for instant joy. Produce • 1 red onion • 1 bulb fennel • 2 cups salad greens • 1 cup fresh sprouts • 8 oz mushrooms (cremini or oyster) • Fruit (grapes, berries, or apple slices) • 2–3 cloves garlic Dairy \u0026 Eggs • 6 eggs • 4 oz feta cheese • 4 oz brie cheese • 1 stick unsalted butter (for baking), and additional salted butter for scrambled eggs. Meat \u0026 Fish / Plant-Based • 6 oz sliced turkey • 1 lb ground lamb • 1 package smoky tempeh Pantry • 1 loaf sourdough or whole wheat bread • 4–6 soft slider buns • 1 jar mayo or veganaise • 1 bottle hot sauce • 1 bottle BBQ sauce • 1 tub hummus (optional) • 1 small bag mixed nuts or crackers • 1½ cups all-purpose flour • ½ cup granulated sugar • 1 tbsp baking powder • 1 tsp vanilla extract Frozen • 1 pint ice cream (vanilla or your favorite flavor) 1. Low \u0026 Slow For the breakfast sammie, scramble the eggs low and slow for the creamiest texture—and don’t skimp on the hot sauce, a sweet and spicy one is ideal. 2. Quick Swaps The lunch plate works with whatever’s on hand—sub cheddar for brie, or add pickles and olives for a salty crunch. 3. Better Mushrooms For the sliders, shred the mushrooms with a fork for that “pulled” texture before tossing in BBQ sauce. 4. Freeze Extras Make the meatballs ahead and freeze extras for future dinners; they also work great with ground turkey. 5. Pre-scooped cookies Double the cookie dough for the ice cream sandwiches and freeze pre-scooped portions—future you will be so happy. What are you favorite sandwiches for summer?",
