But even on the days you barely have a minute to pop by your dorm room, it’s important that your space helps you feel ready for anything.Peyton Koch, a student at Central College, wanted to add a bit of decor that would also help keep her organized. She used Command™ Brand Products to create a cute floating wall calendar by the door, adorned with some of her favorite decor and mementos, so she could check her schedule every morning on her way out and get a mood boost at the same time.“This board is a place to put pieces of my college memories and experience,” Peyton says. “Along with this, I can organize my daily agenda and stay organized as I leave my dorm! I get to look at all my favorite college memories as I mark each day off.” First, Peyton used Command™ 15 lb Large Picture Hanging Strips to secure a chic corkboard to the wall. These strips stick to most smooth surfaces and remove cleanly, so Peyton can display her calendar plus her favorite cards, pennants, and mementos — and change them out to suit her mood — without marring her dorm wall.Using Command™ Clear Mini Hooks, Peyton adorned the wall around the corkboard with decorative touches like a pretty pink lace bow. Trés chic — and RA-approved.Next, Peyton mounted the Command™ Large Organizing Caddy right below her calendar, so her pens and other supplies stay in easy reach. This caddy can hold up to 10 pounds, so it’s perfect for an entryway catch-all moment.“Personalizing my room is important to me because it makes it feel like home. Being in a dorm room away from home, having personal touches and a warm and cozy atmosphere help so much.”Peyton KochTo complete the look, Peyton added boho wall art and a touch of greenery in a macramé plant holder with Command™ Medium Designer Hooks. They’re strong and versatile, holding up to three pounds each: a great tool-free solution for enhancing dorm room style.Now, Peyton’s dorm room feels more like her — and helps her feel ready for whatever the day will bring. “This has made it easier to track what I have every day and keep my schedule in line,” Peyton says. “It has made my room more organized, and it gives it such a stylish, trendy touch to my dorm room.”",
