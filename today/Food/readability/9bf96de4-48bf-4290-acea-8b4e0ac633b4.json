But not just any dessert—think unfussy sweets that you can whip up ahead of time, take on the go, or throw together in the middle of a backyard hang. These treats are simple, summer-ready, and a little nostalgic in the best way. From classic icebox cakes to homemade popsicles, these are the recipes you'll crave after good barbecue. We've also chosen a few festive options with red, white, and blue designs (really anything that incorporates berries will do the job). Here are 26 easy Memorial Day desserts that’ll carry you from the first beach trip to the last bite of pie. And if you're hunting for more menu inspiration, we've rounded up our best Memorial Day side dishes as well. From Our Shop 1. Maialino's Olive Oil Cake You know that old saying, \"When there's a will—plus a nine-inch cake pan, a whisk, and two rental house mixing bowls—there's a way?\" Yeah, that's about this olive oil cake. True story: I once made it in a particularly sparse rental kitchen without any cup measurers, and it was still gone in 15 minutes. 2. Berries With Rosé Just when you needed another excuse to open more rosé, this sophisticated—yet wildly simple—dessert blows into town, and steals the show. It's excellent topped with whipped cream, or you can swap in your favorite ice cream flavors. Oh, and save any leftover rosé syrup for cocktails. 3. One-Step, No-Churn Coffee Ice Cream This brilliant Nigella Lawson recipe is basically magic: It yields creamy, airy ice cream with zero cooking, zero churning, and zero fussing. Your wand to wave? A whisk. Serve the ice cream as-is, straight from the freezer, or make like a three-day weekender and crumble cookies over the top. 4. Berry Summer Pudding For a juicy, berry-filled bread pudding that tastes like it took all day to make, look no further than a loaf of sandwich bread. In this recipe from Food52's Merrill Stubbs, you'll use it to line a bowl, which you'll then layer with barely cooked fresh berries, and more bread. Weigh the whole thing down to chill overnight, and as Merrill writes, \"The result is the essence of summer: The bread absorbs the juices and melts into a sweet, fragrant sponge, and when you cut into the pudding, the berries tumble out like so many rubies and sapphires.\" 5. Chocolate Chip Cookies With Maple \u0026 Olive Oil These caramel-ly, rich cookies are studded with pools of chocolate, and just so happen to require little more than a whisk, bowls, and some baking sheets to whip up. Oh, and did we mention they're vegan? They're vegan. 6. Classic Icebox Cake Whipped cream and chocolate wafer cookies to the rescue! If you can stack, you can make this festive chocolate icebox cake. It's equal parts summery and simple. 7. Swedish Gooey Chocolate Cake This deeply decadent, fudgy chocolate cake takes just five ingredients and 20 minutes; no sifter, stand mixer, or double boiler in sight. 8. Homemade Vanilla Pudding If there's a more straightforward vanilla pudding recipe around, we haven't met it! This one—which asks only for a whisk, a saucepan, gentle heat, and something to stir—is the perfect blank canvas for toppings. 9. Totally Homemade, Ridiculously Easy Hot Fudge Sundae These stunning ice cream sundaes with hot fudge require merely a whisk, plus a pan and spoon for the fudge. Psst: Don't skip the cherry on top. 10. Blueberry Pecan Oat Thumbprint Cookies Slightly fruity, slightly nutty, all easy-as-heck. Sohla shows us how to make nut butter from scratch to fashion these cookies with, but no pressure—use your favorite store-bought brand (may we recommend the selections from Big Spoon Roasters?). 11. Salty-Tangy Preserved Lemon Bars Upgrade your classic lemon bars by using funky, pleasantly salty preserved lemons. Though the ingredient is typically used as a savory condiment, it plays very nicely with the buttery-sweet shortbread crust that acts as the base of this dessert. 12. Chocolate Cake With Peanut Butter Frosting \u0026 Salty Peanuts The definition of \"looks hard; actually isn't.\" Want a layer cake, but don't want to wait for baking and cooling and cutting of a thicker circular cake? Use two sheet pans to create them instead. 13. No-Churn Chocolate Soft-Serve And if you haven't gotten your chocolate fix yet (us either!), try your hand at this no-churn soft-serve. It's got enough of a boozy kick to wake up your taste buds, so choose a liqueur whose flavor you love (we're partial to Kahlua or amaretto). 14. Miso Peanut Butter Cookies With Sesame \u0026 Chocolate Stuffed with what feels like all things savory and sweet, these cookies have a ton going on, but that's why we love 'em. The recipe makes a big batch, so freeze half the dough for a rainy day and thank yourself later. 15. Sohla's Go-To Vanilla Pound Cake And for the epitome of simple, streamlined, and so-good, look no further than Sohla's A+ pound cake. Her recipe also happens to be chock-full of secrets for pound-cake success, so go on, take a peek, won't you? 16. Erin McDowell's Strawberry Not-So-Short Cake Instead of making a bunch of little strawberry shortcakes, make one giant one! An entire pound of butter and a pint of buttermilk are used to make the biscuit dough, so it’s flaky and moist (unlike the dried-out dough of your nightmares). It’s the ultimate crowd-friendly dessert for a Memorial Day picnic. 17. Valencia Orange \u0026 Aperol Ice Pops The zest and juice of California Valencia oranges, plus a little bit of orange flower honey, bring a bright, citrusy flavor to these refreshing ice pops. 18. Saltine Cracker Brownie Ice Cream Sandwich This icebox treat lands somewhere in between brownie a la mode and traditional ice cream sandwiches. The recipe serves 25, which should be more than enough to go around at your Memorial Day fête. 19. Strawberry Coconut Ice Pops These totally vegan ice pops require only four ingredients—fresh sliced strawberries, full-fat coconut milk, sugar, and vanilla extract. 20. Rose Levy Beranbaum's Fresh Open-Faced Blueberry Pie Hear us out—we know it’s a little controversial to serve a blueberry pie without a double crust, but this recipe allows you to appreciate the full bounty of juicy summer blueberries waiting for you on the inside...err, outside, I guess. 21. Chocolate Coffee Ice Cream Cake There’s no question that this caffeinated ice cream cake is destined to be served for dessert on Memorial Day. It will keep everyone awake (even after they’ve eaten a few too many burgers or sticky barbecue ribs) and cool off as the summer rays kick in. 22. Effortless Angel's Food Cake Bake this light-as-the-air angel’s food cake and dress it up any which way. Might I suggest a berry compote with freshly whipped cream and a teeny-tiny bit of lemon zest? 23. Strawberry Rhubarb Icebox Cake Even if the ice cream truck makes the rounds on Memorial Day, this icebox cake, with its Biscoff cookie crust and extra-creamy mascarpone filling swirled with a rhubarb-strawberry jam will bring even more retro fun. The sweet berries are a delicious contrast to the slight tang of the rhubarb—and the presentation is festive as can be for the holiday. 24. Lemon Raspberry Tart This lemon raspberry tart is the exactly kind of show-stopping dessert you'll want to bring to the table. The layer of fresh raspberries make this look a lot more complicated than it actually is. Plus, the red is perfectly on theme with Memorial Day. 25. Mini Coconut Carrot Cakes With Candied Ginger We can't get seem to get enough of these. Mini carrot cakes are the perfect potluck dessert because they're smaller, shareable, and a great post-BBQ bite. 26. Pavlova Wreath Another great Memorial Day option because the berries create a festive red, white, and blue look. The meringue also creates a light and airy bite which is great if you filled up on sides and steak. What's your go-to dessert for long weekends? Let us know in the comments!
