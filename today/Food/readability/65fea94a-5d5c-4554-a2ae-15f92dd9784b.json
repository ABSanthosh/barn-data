All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: refrina/ShutterstockFor Trader Joe’s fans, the latest must-have bags aren’t from designers like Louis Vuitton or Gucci. No, the it bag of the season is always straight from Trader Joe’s itself. The store that is best known for its unique and affordably-priced groceries is also known among Trader Joe’s shoppers for having the cutest — not to mention most versatile — tote bags. And if you happen to love cheese as much as you love Trader Joe’s, the store’s latest reusable tote bag is about to have you reaching for your car keys ASAP. Recently spotted at Trader Joe’s stores is a “Cheese Adventures” grocery tote bag. The red bag with yellow handles is decorated with adorable illustrations and hilariously cheesy cheese-inspired puns. A wheel of cheese exclaims, “I’m wheel excited to be here,” and a cheese grater says, “This is so grate.” Honestly, we’ve never seen a tote bag this entertaining!Made from 100 percent cotton, the cheesy tote bag — along with all of Trader Joe’s other tote bags — is surprisingly durable. It’s made to last, so you’ll be able to use it for your trips to the grocery store time and time again. Plus, it’s machine-washable so if you get a little bit of Brie stuck to the inside of the bag or the lid pops off your container of grated Parm, you don’t have to worry.“I purchased mine yesterday! I love the design” wrote one Trader Joe’s fan on Instagram. “I love this bag!” said another, “I carry my lunch box and water bottles in it.” It’s so functional, you might even want to pick up a second one while you’re at it.The best part? The tote is only $3.99, and “you cheddar believe it” that Trader Joe’s always keeps the tote bag prices as affordable as its groceries. Whether you’re an avid tote bag collector or you simply love cheese, you’re going to want to scoop one up as soon as you can, because once these cheese-themed totes are gone, there’s no telling if they’ll be restocked.Once you have your cheese tote you can kick back, relax, and think, “‘Life’s so gouda!”",
