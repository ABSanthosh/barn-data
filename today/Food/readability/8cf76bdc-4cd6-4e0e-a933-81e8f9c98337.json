I will always be a back-to-school lover, so August and September always feel like the start of the year for me. It’s the perfect time for nesting, reorganizing, and checking in with yourself. So, tell me, how are we doing? What are we feeling? I’m sure I know the answer: all of it. Election years are always exhausting, are they not? The last election year we were still in the midst of a pandemic, my grandmother just passed away from COVID, and not a thing made sense. This year feels equally as exhausting! I’m sure we were all watching the debate separately, but together – there’s nothing I want to say about it either, but hold your pets close, friends. Anyway, I finished my writing course with Story Studio, and it was life changing. Eventually, you’ll see me promote a book, and I’ll tell you ahead of time that I’ll be beside myself. Let’s get into this lovely Sunday! • If you haven’t checked out Amy’s back-to-school Sunday post, it is chock full of gems. Taurus to Taurus, Amy really just gets it, you know? (Joy the Baker) • I’ll tell you, Instagram ads have my number and call it often. I fell for the most beautiful nail polish called Moon Cat, and, really, can you blame me? It’s so pretty! (mooncat) • As we remember 9/11, here is a current day perspective you’d never think about – the memorial pools. (YouTube) • Today’s semi-long read is a weepy one. Two best friends, one seeing the other through the end of their life, talk through if they could have made it as a couple. Reheat the coffee, grab the Kleenex. (NYTimes gift link) • This is a perfect weekend to make Browned Butter Blueberry Muffins. The category of breakfast cake is definitely a favorite, mostly because you can slather it in cream cheese and no one yells at me. Well, that and I simply do not care. (Joy the Baker) • I just started How to Die Alone starring Natasha Rothwell (she played my favorite character on Insecure). She plays a JFK employee afraid to fly, and there have been so many laugh out loud moments. I want to watch the entire thing, but thankfully they’re only releasing a bit at a time. Highly recommend! (Hulu) • Not sure why fall makes me hungry for pancakes constantly, but these “throw-it-together” pancakes are right up my alley for a Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday morning (Substack) • Let me fill you in on the current TikTok drama on my side of the internet. Buckle up! This make up artist did a bride’s make up, made a decision on her own to stick around “to film content”, then burst into tears when the bridal party forced her to leave. This was after she snuck into the venue, had dinner, and bombarded into professional photos! Insane!! • Also, have you joined cucumber-tok yet? Well, I’m not giving you an option, you’re gonna join me. Logan has ruined/changed my life, but also I am healthier so I really should be thanking him. (TikTok) • This recommendation is from my heart to yours. This will elevate your life in such a way that you’ll need my address to send along a thank you card. The Hug Sleep Pod is basically an adult sleep swaddle, specifically marketed to people with sensory issues. It truly hugs you, but keeps a temperature control foot hole available. I gave one to my girlfriend last Christmas and I will never be able to give her a better present – I outdid myself too early. (Hug Sleep) • We all know Christian Girl Autumn is upon us, but over here I’m having Meemaw Fall. Moo-moo’s, crockpots, board games and baking y’all. Apartment Therapy has the best board games to pair with your floor length shapeless dress and house shoes. Meemaw fall! (Forbes, TikTok, Apartment Therapy) •  And, honestly, instead of welcoming fall we’re welcoming Soup Season. To me, they’re the real star of fall, alongside candy corn and peanuts. I’ll hear no slander about candy corn, especially if you willingly eat plain chocolate M\u0026M’s. Treat yourself with chili (star tip, I add 1/4 c coffee to it), or maybe this creamy tomato soup with grilled cheese made from this stellar no-knead bread . Side note: my chili has beans. Texas, you can keep your beef stew disguised as chili to your dang self. (Joy the Baker, Instagram)",
