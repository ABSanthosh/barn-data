If you’re looking for an easy spring cocktail that tastes like sunshine and garden parties, this is it!I’ve been craving a homemade lemon drop since the first bag of Meyer lemons hit the market, and while I debated saving this one for Mother’s Day, it’s just too good to wait. A fresh sip with a floral twist feels perfectly fancy for Easter—because nothing says spring like a Lavender Lemon Drop Martini in a chilled floral coupe.Join me in this perfect moment, and trust that we’ll use the rest of the bag of dried lavender for lemonade all summer long. Once your homemade lavender syrup is cooled we can officially declare it cocktail o’clock.Start by popping a coupe glass in the freezer (because a chilled glass is the kind of detail that makes makes all the difference). While that chills, fill a cocktail shaker with ice and add the vodka or gin—depending on whether you want botanical and breezy or clean and classic—plus a splash of orange liqueur, a good squeeze of lemon juice, and a pour of that floral syrup you just made.Shake it like you mean it until the shaker feels frosty in your hands. Before you pour, take one more joyful step and zhuzh the rim of your chilled glass with a mix of lemon zest and sugar—for a hint of sparkle. Strain the perfectly shaken martini into the glass, top with a delicate sprig of lavender and take an easy, slow sip. It’s spring in a glass, no notes.This Lavender Lemon Drop is the breezy, floral cocktail your Easter brunch deserves—pretty, punchy, and just the right amount of fancy. If you’re skipping the booze this year (or want something for the kids’ table), whip up a batch of Fresh Blueberry Mint Lemonade! The color along is incredible!",
