All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Rebecca WaldenA baking sheet (or sheet pan) is one of the most frequently used items in any home cook’s kitchen — and it almost always has the patina to prove it. You’ll rarely find a baking sheet in anyone’s kitchen that’s free of brown spots or stains. Seemingly overnight, the entire pan can take on a very weathered, blackened hue. I call it “well-seasoned” and consider these marks as a badge of honor — but at some point, a deep cleaning becomes absolutely necessary.The Best Way to Deep Clean Baking SheetsHow I Tested the Different MethodsBaking Soda and Aluminum FoilBaking Soda and VinegarCream of Tartar and VinegarEasy Off and Brillo PadsA sponge with warm, soapy water isn’t always enough to get the job done, especially when there are burnt or stuck-on bits of food and grease. That’s why I tested five popular cleaning methods in 2025 to find the best way to get those baking sheets looking (almost) as good as new. Turns out, there was one clear winner. Here’s everything you need to know about how to clean baking sheets (with minimal effort!).The Best Way to Deep Clean Baking Sheets The best way to deep clean a sheet pan is to soak it in a paste of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide overnight. This loosens everything so you can scrape most of the gunk off with a plastic scraper before washing with warm, soapy water and a scrubby sponge.How I Tested the Different MethodsIt’s important to note that for both the testing and the shoot, we used aluminum pans, which had a decent layer of baked-on food residue from roasting lots and lots of veggies. The pans had all been scrubbed after each use, and there was still a lot of baked-on gunk to chip away at.Credit: Photo: Joe Lingeman; Design: The KitchnThe ratings: Each method received a rating of one to five, with five being the best method overall, and one being the least favorite method. All the methods were effective — it’s just that some took more effort than others, or had some key step the testers didn’t love. Along with the ratings, you’ll find notes on how easy or difficult the method was, how much elbow grease it took to clean the pans, and how much time it took to remove all the gunk. Sheet Pan Cleaning Method: Baking Soda \u0026 Aluminum Foil Total time: 10 to 15 minutes Rating: 1/5 The method: Sprinkle your sheet pan with baking soda and enough water so that it makes a paste. Wad up a sheet of aluminum foil and use it like a scrubber sponge, working in circles all around the surface of the pan. Occasionally reposition the aluminum foil in your hand if it gets too flat, and continue rubbing it all over the pan until the pan comes clean. Rinse and wash with warm soapy water.How it went: I had high hopes for this method because it worked wonders when I tested it on cleaning burnt food off of pans, but it fell short. I did eventually get results, but it took time and lots of elbow grease. This method might be better used on baking sheets that have bigger chunks of food stuck on, rather than flat, baked-on stains.Although I didn’t love this method the most, if you have a piece of foil that would otherwise be used once and tossed, I do recommend balling it up and using it as a first pass. Just be sure to crumple it in a way that keeps any food stuck to the foil on the inside of the ball so you don’t end up spreading more gunk onto the pan you’re attempting to clean.Sheet Pan Cleaning Method: Baking Soda \u0026 Vinegar Total time: 45 minutes (15 active minutes) Rating: 2/5 The method: Make a paste with baking soda and vinegar and spread it on the surface of the pan. Let it sit for 30 minutes, then scrub away with a damp sponge. Wash with warm, soapy water.How it went: The baking soda method removed a good amount of grime but took a significant amount of time and a lot of scrubbing. I actually switched out my regular sponge for a scrubby one halfway through.I found that letting the stuff soak for longer didn’t make much of a difference either. In one test, I let the mixture sit for 30 minutes, and in another, I let it sit for eight hours. Each test area came out equally clean but required the same amount of scrubbing.Sheet Pan Cleaning Method: Cream of Tartar \u0026 Vinegar Total time: 8+ hours (10 to 15 active minutes) Rating: 3/5 The method: Sprinkle cream of tartar evenly across the baking sheet. Activate it by spritzing the cream of tartar with enough vinegar to soak through. Let the mixture dry for at least eight hours, then scrub away with a scrubby sponge and warm water. Rinse with soap and water.How it went: I found this method to be the most surprising because when you think of a powerful kitchen cleaning agent, you probably think of baking soda, not cream of tartar. But when this acidic byproduct from the wine-making process mixes with vinegar, it breaks down grime and makes scrubbing a lot easier.This process required quite a bit of downtime, but the longer I let the mixture sit and do its job, the less time I spent scrubbing my pans. With just a scrubby sponge and warm water (read: very little actual effort), I was able to get the pan looking good as new. If any stains persist, you can repeat the process.Sheet Pan Cleaning Method: Easy Off \u0026 Brillo Pads Total time: 30 minutes (10 active minutes) Rating: 4/5 The method: Spray the entire surface of the pan with Easy Off and place the pan in the oven or set it outside in a safe place for 20 minutes. Then, put the pan in the sink, run warm water, and use a Brillo pad to scrub away any remaining grime. Rinse and wash well with warm, soapy water. How it went: Because Easy Off is a bit fume-y (lemon-scented fumes), I sprayed the pan outside in the garage and left it there for 20 minutes. Once my timer went off, I brought it back inside and scrubbed it with a Brillo pad.I assumed it wouldn’t take much effort at all and that I would be able to wipe off the grime with a paper towel — just like when I used it to clean my oven — but 20 minutes wasn’t quite enough time to completely obliterate the gunk. A small amount of scrubbing effort was required on my part. Still, I was very pleased with how quickly the stains came off — all the stains, even the really tough old ones.Impressive as it was, I couldn’t shake the fact that I was using a bunch of chemicals on my baking sheet that I’d soon be using to roast my organic veggies. This process clearly passed the test (it quickly loosened grime and required minimal scrubbing!), but it wasn’t my favorite method.Note: While we used this method with an aluminum sheet pan and had no issues, you may want to try a different method if you’re worried about it damaging your pan. This method may work better for stainless steel pans because the surface is sturdier and more resistant, whereas aluminum is more delicate. You can always test a corner of your pan first to be sure before spraying the entire thing. And, as always, follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the bottle.Sheet Pan Cleaning Method: Baking Soda \u0026 Hydrogen Peroxide Total time: 8+ hours (10 active minutes) Rating: 5/5 The method: Sprinkle baking soda liberally all over the surface of the pan, then spray a generous amount of hydrogen peroxide over the baking soda until all the powder is wet. Let the whole thing sit overnight. Then, use a plastic scraper and scrape all the baking soda into a pile and dump it into the garbage. Wash the pan in warm, soapy water with a scrubby sponge. How it went: After scraping away the dried baking soda, I got down to business with the scrubber and was pleased to see that the stains were coming up quite easily. It took some effort, but not much. Most of the stains were lifted, and my baking sheets looked extra clean! The before and after was seriously impressive, and I loved that the hard work was done for me while I slept.Have you tried any of these methods? Let us know your favorite in the comments below!",
