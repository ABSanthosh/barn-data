  "text": "Hi, friends, and good Sunday to you. Can I be honest with y’all? Struggling is not the word I would use to describe life at the moment. I know everyone is feeling it but my goodness – it feels like I’m already on the ground, and can you please stop kicking me?? If you read poetry, Kate J. Baer describes the chaotic throes of life pretty well, in case you need a literary outlet. I currently have 5 jobs (1 full time, 4 part time) and none of them fully cover rent/bills. While I believe this will not be life forever, living in the midst of it is beyond stressful. There are some good things happening though! Lately, I have started walking home from work (about a 20 minute walk) to a) decompress and b) move my body with no expectation other than meandering home. It is not a hot girl walk by any means – it’s more of a slightly depressed girl shuffle – but it’s been helpful. Also, my girlfriend and I just booked a trip to Europe in February for our 3 year anniversary and I am beyond excited. Trust that closer to the date (let’s be real, next month) I will be asking for all your recommendations! What outlets do you turn to when life piles on? And what’s been good in your life? Today’s Sunday deserves coffee in the largest mug you own, and the coziest pajamas you stay in all day. For good measure, change the sheets on your bed, too. Future you will thank present you. Let’s get into it. • Amy, fellow Joy the Baker team member, fellow Taurus, and honestly my bestie (I promise she’s aware), is also going through the hard trudge of life right now. She wrote the most beautiful words about herself, her partner, and her mother-in-law, who is nearing the end of her life. It will squeeze every part of your heart. (Substack) • Kiese Laymon is a writer whose style I describe as beautifully written with the potential to wreck you emotionally. His work “Heavy” is one of those emotional gut punches you cannot put down. Kiese was recently diagnosed with cancer and this incredibly written letter is the result of learning that. The opening line, “I do not want to disappoint God, Mississippi, or home, but I have to…” made me sit all the way down. (Bookshop, Bitter Southerner) • I feel like I talk to you a lot about TikTok, but there’s such fun stuff there! Keith Lee is one of the best people borne of making TikTok’s about food he likes or dislikes. He has risen to fame for his controversial takes on food, making or breaking businesses, which is wild. He gave a local Chicago restaurant, Cleo’s Southern Cuisine, a 10 out of 10 and they’ve been booming ever since. (TikTok, NYT gift link) • It’s finally here! Pumpkin Texas Sheet Cake. Joy’s mind, you know? Her mind! This cake is beautiful, it’s southern, and it’s filled with brown butter and pecans. If Ina Garten was here she would say, “What could be bad about that?” (Instagram, Joy the Baker) • Whenever there are a bunch of birds chirping in a bush, my mom says, “They’re having a meeting!” but it turns out they’re actually having a meeting. I wonder who takes the meeting minutes? Scientists have started to decode birdsong and chatter. What a time! (New Yorker – subscriptions are $1/week right now!) • I’m unsure if it’s my social feed or just the time we’re in but the subject of religion and parenting have been popping up full force. My OG favorite blogger, DesignMom, just released a parenting book with her husband called “The Kids Are All Right”. Her Mormon-raised family of 8 genuinely gets along, which is a marvel to me. Her philosophy has always been, “Children do not owe their parents anything,” which feels like a hot take, but one I believe in. On the ex-evangelical side of things I am hearing more children going no-contact with their parents for various reasons. I do not have kids of my own, but I do have a complicated parent relationship. I’m curious to get your thoughts on this! (Hachette Book Group, New Yorker) • What are we wearing this fall/winter? I saw a girl wearing a sparkly prairie skirt and flats. I prayed for her forthcoming athlete’s foot and ran in the opposite direction. I’ve recently joined Amy in the barrel pants trend, and let me tell you. They’re comfy and stupid cute. My favorites are currently from Anthropologie and H\u0026M.  And hopefully, leopard print won’t ever go out of style either – it’s my favorite neutral. (NYT gift link) • Y’all, I have found my perfect fall food. Is it soup, is it pasta? The answer is yes – it’s pastina. A little broth, a metric ton of freshly grated parmesan, cracked black pepper, and olive oil. *kisses fingertips* (A Cozy Kitchen) • Let’s just all eat Caesar salads forever. Great, so glad that’s settled. And we’re sharing fries, duh. (Instagram) • If you could take your significant other on a Hometown Date, The Bachelor/Bachelorette style, would you? Maybe introducing them to your hometown takes away the mystery, who knows, but it begs the question: do you have to see where someone is from to know who they really are? (Nashville Scene) • As a person that suffers from seasonal depression, me and my girlfriend have been thinking of making a winter bucket list. A list we may or may not finish but we’re slowly building it. So far we have the Garfield Park Conservatory at the top of the list. Warm rooms full of desert plants? Absolutely. What else should be on that list? Maybe a bar that has a fireplace! (The Albion Manor) • Please tell me you know Taryn Delanie, Miss New York and famous for her hilarious videos, namely Heaven’s Receptionist. I want so badly to be her best friend. She’s so funny, so gorgeous how is it legal, and incredibly nice. She’s sharing how she spends her Sundays. She’s literally just a girl, just like us! (Instagram, NYT gift link) • It’s not too early for Christmas shopping. Have you picked up your copy of the Life-Changing Magic of Baking or Joy the Baker magazine yet? Fun fact, I’m in the magazine! Preaching the good gospel of Boursin cheese in your mashed potatoes. (Amazon, Magazine Shop)",
