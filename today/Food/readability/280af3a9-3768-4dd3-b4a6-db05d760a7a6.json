Food Stylist: Samantha Seneviratne. Prop Stylist: Paige Hicks.July 2, 2025Updated 3:32 p.m. ETI believe the first bite into a perfectly ripe mango has three parts: first, a humbling, then a flood of nostalgia and, finally, a restoration of spirit. This is the power of a great mango.They knock us off our pedestals. No matter how nimble an eater you may be, there’s a mango out there waiting to defy your hands and lips. Forego all politeness. A sticky mess awaits.When I bite into one, I compare that initial sweetness to the tart and acidic flavors that build as I get closer to the seed. But I am also judging the mango in my hand against some elusive one I remember. I have a lot of room in my imagination for mangoes.Great mangoes can elicit powerful memories. It takes a special fruit to ease the tension of a moment, connecting us both to a past season and to the promise of the next bounty. For me, the mango is that fruit. And the three recipes here (a salad, a dessert and a savory relish) give you something creative to do with your remaining mangoes — after you’ve devoured the first few you’ve brought back from the market.Writing these recipes, as it is for all dishes that center mangoes, was a sticky business. Some ingredients are predictable, easy to control — but how little control we have over mangoes. Each is a surprise, shaped by the characteristics of its original region. There’s no homogeneity.Some mangoes are sweeter than others, some are more fibrous. But the best ones are always ready to send juice dripping down your chin, buttery, tart, immediately transporting you to wherever you may have had your favorite: West Africa, Southeast Asia, Mexico and the Caribbean, the Pacific Islands, or some grove you know nearby.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
