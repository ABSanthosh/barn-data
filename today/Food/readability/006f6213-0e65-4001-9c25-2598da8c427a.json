I started my 19th year of teaching back in August, but judging by the number of first-day-of school photos filling my Internet feeds, it seems like many kids are starting back after Labor Day. I’m here this weekend to offer my best back-to-school tips for all ages (and some treats for parents, too). As an adult who has been living that school life for quite literally my entire life, I have some insight to help everyone survive the school year.  • Cancel that dinner and pull up some couch: I realize that it may be too late for some of you, but I think about this advice every year for my own adult self. Do not make plans for the weekend after school begins. No special dinners or weekend excursions or celebratory adventures. Pajamas, movies, naps, takeout. Everyone’s brains are adjusting. Educators, this goes for you, too. Personally, I follow this advice for the first month or so. Going from a summer of freedom to structure and early wake-ups and people requires a lot of recovery. (Scary Mommy) • I can barely pack my own lunch, so I salute those of you who are out here packing lunches for kids every day. If you’re looking to make it easier, I love this take on setting up a lunch system to make it easier for everyone. I am also a big fan of Bows and Bentos on Instagram — Rachel has great thoughts on feeding kids in general. Also, because I’m a public educator at a school that is historically under-resourced, I remind folks as frequently as I can that free school meals for kids benefit every kid at all economic levels and having your kids take part helps keep them free for all, which means fewer hungry kids.  (Mom’s Kitchen Handbook, Instagram, The General Consensus) • Personally, I love to organize all my little snacks and fridge items (I’m a Taurus married to a Cancer, we are homebodies) and I love these Brightroom plastic bins. I also think this pegboard set-up would be perfect for a desk area, a kid’s room, or pretty much anything that needs to be organized. Confession: I also may need this more adult version for my office. (Target) • If you’re taking kids to school and managing your own belongings and theirs and want to evolve beyond a tote bag, I cannot recommend this Madewell tote enough. It’s also my best recommendation for teachers. I’ve had mine for a few years now and I take it to work every day, stuffed to the gills with papers to grade and water bottles and books and whatever I need to cram in there and it looks brand new. I love that it looks decent enough to carry to dinner or into a store after work, too — it doesn’t scream “TEACHER.” (Madewell) • If you’re still backpack hunting for your kid, Teen Vogue swears that these are the trendiest ones around. Based on my anecdotal research (how many I pick up off the floor of my classroom so I don’t trip because these kids do not hang their bags up!!!), these Sprayground backpacks are also extremely popular. (Teen Vogue, Sprayground) • If you’re a new teacher or educator or even one who’s been around for awhile, I shared my best advice for teachers. I stand by it. (Substack)  • Highly suggest making one of my all-time favorite JTB recipes, Everybody’s After School Cookies, in bulk ASAP. They’re good for any time, not just after school. (Joy The Baker) • Parents of tweens, I cannot stress this enough: PLEASE MAKE YOUR CHILD A PERIOD KIT. I have spent many days scrubbing blood off of chairs in my classroom, and I keep a few extra sweatshirts in my room for those days when kiddos need to tie one around their waist. I would have given anything for period underwear as a teenager. If you’re not sure how to discuss this topic, here are some tips. I’ve also been pleasantly surprised at how many young boys are much more empathetic about periods now — it matters that you speak to your sons about periods, too. (LifeHacker, KnixTeen, HelloPeriod, Kin Fertility) • School can come with all kinds of big feelings and hurts, even for our littlest kids. Here are some great ways to deal with relational aggression, including book suggestions to read with your kids to help them cope. (A Mighty Girl) • How to set up a study area at home that your child will actually use. (Cool Mom Picks) • As an English teacher, many, many parents ask me how to raise kids who love to read. My answer is always the same: read Janssen’s blog. From book recommendations to tips on helping your kids learn to love reading, this blog has so many good tips to make reading part of your family life. (Everyday Reading) • Speaking of reading, when your brain stops being overwhelmed by back to school nonsense, let me recommend God of the Woods. If a whole novel feels overwhelming, Mary Oliver is always a good idea, and Ross Gay’s Book of Delights is, well, delightful. (Bookshop) • If you’re looking for ways to connect with your kids (especially at more difficult moments), this book is fantastic. (Bookshop) • If I could give one piece of parenting advice as someone who spends all day with teens, it would be please set boundaries around cell phones. Phones are making kids anxious, depressed, making it hard for kids to concentrate, and they’re making school more difficult. Here are some tips about how to come between a teen and a phone. (The Atlantic, NYT, ChildMind)  • Want a crowd-pleaser dinner that includes vegetables? This one-pot Homemade Hamburger Helper is incredible. (Joy The Baker) • The grand finale: my ultimate pen and notebook lineups. My favorite black pens, gel pens, highlighter/marker combo, and felt tip pens. My favorite fancy notebook, old standby, and cheaper notebooks (that can often be found at Target, but with a larger selection on their website!).  (Amazon, Appointed, Moleskine, Decomposition)",
