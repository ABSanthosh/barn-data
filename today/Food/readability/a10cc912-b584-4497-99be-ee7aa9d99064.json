I’ve been recovering from a lil’ surgery this past week and I can confirm, I’m the most impatient patient.  Firstly, when you call something”lil”, it seems very cutsey – not like you’ve shuffled laps around the recovery unit trying to will yourself to pee before you’re discharged.  Secondly, I’ll give myself two days, one box of popsicles, and one season of Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles worth of couch time before I’ve HAD IT and I’m back to projects at The Bakehouse. Here we are.  Back in the game with a few new scars, a hallway gallery wall hung, a new bird of paradise plant potted on the porch, and a book to launch! I’m so glad you’re here.  I pray you’re better at resting than I am.  If not, feign a few moments with this week’s post. •  I told you a few weeks ago that my dad and I wrote a children’s book!  That book is just days from meeting the world! Writing The Life-Changing Magic of Baking with my dad was such a blessing.  We went through old family photos, consulted with mom a lot, made cakes, and the book came out even better than we could have hoped.  The Life-Changing Magic of Baking is beautifully illustrated, filled with life lessons we’ve learned in the kitchen together, and has a stellar cake recipe at the end!  Every child in your life should have a copy, obviously.  You can purchase a personalized and signed copy of the book from my local Houston bookstore  Blue Willow Books, or a regularly signed copy from my favorite bookstore in Seattle Book Larder, and, of course, the book is also available on Amazon.  •  The way my knees would absolutely revolt in an Adult Gymnastics class.  Would you / could you? (TIME)  •  Let’s talk about the post-fight funk in relationships.  I often equate it to a vulnerability hangover.  Here’s some helpful ways to Bounce Back Emotionally After A Fight With Your Partner.  Touch grass and/or go for a motorcycle ride. (Self)  •  Our friend Toby makes a case for cruising solo with kids and, as always, she’s hilariously spot on. (Gloria) •  Forever near the top of my list of New Orleans must-dos is a drink at the Hotel Monteleone, specifically seated at the slowly rotating carousel bar.  Yes, it’s lovely and the longer you sit and drink, very disorienting.  Spin Through 75 Years of Carousel Bar History. (Garden and Gun)  •  If you were a teenage girl sitting on the living room floor too close to the television, you likely agree with the sentiment that Nothing on TV Felt Like “My So Called Life”.  This interview with the creator of the show Winnie Holtzman touches on so much! What a very singular moment in time that show was. (New York Magazine)  •  Please bookmark this Cake Puzzle for holiday and housewarming gifts. I think we all need a puzzle table, you know? (Piecework Puzzles)  •  A few mornings back I felt the slightest hint of a chill on my bare feet as I walked from my bedroom to the kitchen and thought – is it slipper season!? I treat myself to a new pair of slippers every fall.  I’m a pretty irresponsible house slipper wearer because I will, in fact, wear my house shoes into the backyard or out to get the mail.  Inside shoes are going outside. I can’t stop it.  For that reason, I’m thinking this pair of LL Bean Moccasins are my slipper of the year. (LL Bean) •  My friend Edd Kimber is one of my favorite bakers (it’s really no wonder he won the first season of the Great British Bake Off, has a fantastic newsletter filled with recipes, and has a new cookbook coming out!) But he’s also highly influenced my fall fashion because y’all:  butter sweatshirts!  (Substack, Amazon, NovelMart)  •  I’m tucking the idea of this Orange Ginger Garlic Chicken away for future dinner.  It looks so easy and so fresh! (Instagram) •  I’ve finally made my first kitchen altar for the sunroom just off my kitchen (where I have a large restaurant-style butcher block, do most of my baking, and let the dishes pile up). Home is starting to feel more like home.  If you’re not familiar with the idea of a kitchen altar, here’s how! (Instagram, Joy the Baker)  •  Our friend Timmy has 15 High Protein Vegan Meals and so many of them are perfectly cozy for fall! (Mississippi Vegan) •  I think I’ve entered my Plates On Wall As Decor Era.  Thoughts? (Pinterest) Have a sweet Sunday, friends! My love to you! xo Joy",
