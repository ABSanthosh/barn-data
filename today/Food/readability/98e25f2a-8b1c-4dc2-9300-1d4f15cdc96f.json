This week, I’ve taken large strides on The Bakehouse Texas, removing old old wallpaper and painting many of the rooms.  It’s very slowly starting to feel this might just be my house and the old owners won’t be strolling in at any moment.  In what feels rather symbolic, I’ve been sleeping downstairs in what was the guest room because the upstairs master bathroom feels very much like someone else’s bedroom.  People say “if those walls could talk” but I feel like these walls definitely are communicating and I’m slowly talking into them letting me make this space my own. I hope this finds you taking it easy this Labor Day.  I feel like, from here on out, we’re barreling towards the end of the year, but let’s just ride the brakes for as long as they’ll hold. •  If you need me, I’m outside sheet mulching the front garden because I can’t let the weeds of the summer win.  I’ve never been much of a gardener but this house is turning me into one, like it or not. The goal is to replace all of the finicky rose bushes with native ornamental grasses, hearty perennials like blue salvia, and fun easy cut flowers when spring rolls around. I’m a new member of the John Fairy Conservation Garden, where you can find me wandering around trying to make myself a native landscape artist.  (Fine Gardening) •  We’re proudly celebrating the beauty of broad shoulders and a strong back.  USA Rugby Olympian Ilona Maher is on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition and she’s literally unstoppable.  The muscle mass – can you EVEN!?  I’m excited that girls get to witness the celebration of this version of girlhood.  (Sports Illustrated) •  I love Bronwen’s very honest take on How To Start A Cake Business.  (Substack) •  I’m going to need your eyes on Yolanda Hadid’s modern Texas ranch. Never have I ever heard the words “industrial” and “relaxed” in the same sentence. Is this a Yellowstone villian era home? I’ve been taking in a lot of home inspiration as I bring The Bakehouse together and well… sometimes it helps to see what not to do.  Respectfully.  (YouTube) •  In related news, I’m color-drenching the sunroom in Palladian Blue (a very common color used as the underside of porches in New Orleans) and it could be brilliant or an absolute mess. I don’t think there’s an in between.  (House Beautiful, Benjamin Moore) •  September feels like a very “there’s food at home” month, right?  Well, as long as there’s a pot of Red Beans and Rice at home.  (Joy the Baker) •  Do we love pickles enough to make Pickle Galettes?  They are cute.   (Lily Morello) •  It’s probably just me being prematurely ready for cozy season but, I made these Small-Batch Salted Caramel Gingersnap Cookies and you should definitely bookmark this for the first chill in the air. (Instagram) •  I love an easy fall ritual and we’ve nearly reached open window weather here in Texas.  “Luften” is the German ritual you need to try ASAP!  (Apartment Therapy) •  In a world of political opinions stacked on top of each other it’s nice to just get facts and nothing else. Jordan is a lawyer who does just that and honestly, I can’t get enough. (Apple Podcasts) •   I’m looking forward to filing this summer away, turning on the oven and baking some bread everyday, but if you don’t – if you’re not ready to say goodbye to these days, here’s 7 Ways To Beat The End of Summer Blues. (Time) •  PSA that Boden has really cute sweaters this season and this pink and red sweater is very high up on my wishlist. (Boden) •  Absolutely no one asked but I went ahead and ate a Pineapple and Mayonnaise Sandwich anyway.  It was surprisingly decent and somehow even more delicious with the addition of grated sharp cheddar cheese.  I don’t know how to expain it but the sweet, salty, sharp combination of soft sliced white bread just – WORKS.  Many people in the comments called it – I’m not from the midwest and have never had a Pineapple Casserole. (Instagram, Southern Living) Take good care, friends! My love to you. xo Joy Reader Interactions RELATED POSTS IN Let It Be Sunday!",
