Food Stylist: Monica Pierini.Remember how I said that I didn’t want summer to end, that I wasn’t ready for fall? Wow, do I ever take it back. As I write this, the fluorescent yellow leaves on the honey locust tree outside my window are fluttering in the breeze, chuckling and shaking their heads at me. Fall is great, and I was a dummy for thinking I could resist its bountiful produce.That’s where I am, though. This fall has looked and felt very different for lots of people across the country. Wherever you are, I hope you’re OK, and maybe finding some comfort in eating and cooking.I plan to work my way through this collection of 10 excellent butternut squash recipes, starting with Ali Slagle’s pasta with butternut squash, kale and brown butter. Garam masala makes this all-star lineup of autumnal flavors even more warm and comforting, but, as Ali notes, you could swap in five spice, turmeric with chile powder or cinnamon with crushed fennel seeds. I love, too, that this dish calls for whole wheat pasta, durum wheat’s heartier, nuttier, spooky-season sibling.Then again, maybe I want to kick off squash season with Sohla El-Waylly’s roasted squash with spiced onion gravy. Or Zainab Shah’s kaddu with greens and shrimp. Or maybe I just need a giant batch of roasted butternut squash to add to salads or eat with fried eggs (or, the most likely scenario, to snack on straight from the fridge while I decide what to do with it).AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT",
