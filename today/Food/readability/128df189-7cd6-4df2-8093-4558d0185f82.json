  "text": "In lieu of a summer bucket list, I’ve made one singular seasonal goal. It’s related to my side quest as a self-proclaimed Pool Dad: I’d like to learn how to dive. Not belly-flop off a boat or tiptoe into the shallow end like I’ve done for the past 44 years. I’m talking about a proper, casual, arms-first, toes-pointed, clean-arc dive that says something like, “Oh this? I summer in Maine.”   As a kid, I took swim lessons in my neighbor’s freezing pool and simply refused to do what the instructor asked. I stood at the edge, arms in position, and simply said no. For an hour. Every time. Stubborn? Seems so; which may explain my current swimming mediocrity. Here we are, decades later, and I’m back at the edge of the pool, convincing myself to lean in. Isn’t that what diving really is? A decision. A metaphor for trying something even though I’m afraid. It’s giving: Do it scared. So each morning this summer, I’m going to try. First sitting. Then crouching. Maybe eventually standing. It’s bound to be awkward. I know that’s true because I took a video of my first – third seated dive this morning and immediately hurt my own feelings watching it back.  Nevermind the optics. I’m going to give it the old Pool Dad Try (followed by a glass of Pineapple Mint Agua Fresca, pictures above).  The offering this week is below. As always, take what you need: • There’s a feeling I haven’t quite been able to name — watching from the sidelines with surprise, dread, and a growing sense of heartbreak as the Jewish community faces escalating violence and an alarming silence from the rest of us. This piece by Robert Glazer gave shape to that feeling here: We Are Better Than This. It’s a necessary read, especially if you’re not Jewish. Especially if you haven’t known what to say, and especially if you believe we can and should do better. (Substack) •  I’ve lived in Bellville for over a year now, and it’s high time I get serious about building my friend group. The truth is, adult friendships take a lot of effort and a bit of a mindset shift. This essay by April and the Fool (love this Substack name!) on How to  Become Friends With Literally Anyone made me feel hopeful. It’s an encouraging guide on how to talk to new people, not from obligation but from real curiosity.  Walls down, babes. We’re more alike than we realize.  (Substack) •  Will introduced me to Noraly Schoenmaker’s YouTube channel, Itchy Boots, where she documents her solo motorcycle rides across the globe. Will would fall asleep halfway through an episode, but I’d stay up completely transfixed by her grit, her cheer, and how she can fix a bike in the middle of nowhere with a headlamp and a good attitude.  It’s incredible. I told Will I could do the same thing, I’d just cry a lot A LOT more.  Her new book, Free Ride, is just the kind of summer read I want: heartfelt, and full of reminders that we’re capable of so much adventure.(YouTube, Bookshop.org) •  Happy Hot Dog Summer to all who celebrate!  What’s your favorite hot dog brand?  I’ve been a Hebrew National girlie for ever but this video Pro Chefs Blind Taste Test Every Hot Dog maaaaay just be changing my mind.  Please sound off. (YouTube) •  And while we’re talking about sausages, my friend Cara, one of the esteemed the butchers in the above video, makes the most delicious chicken and veggie sausages that absolutely should be on your grill this summer.  My fave are the Chicken Parm Sausages. (Seemore) •  I haven’t stopped thinking about this piece from Time about a woman who became a professional bodybuilder at 50.  The size of the bikinis alone are… inspired. Women aren’t meant to shrink. We’re built to last.  And now I’m feeling like I could really lift heavier at the gym:  Becoming a Bodybuilder Taught Me Women Aren’t  Meant  To Be Thin (Time) •  Rice pudding is one of those things that, if in the house, I will consume exclusively until it’s entirely devoured.  Also on that list is Cool Ranch Doritos, any chip and guacamole combination, and Oreo cookies. I saw this divinely inspired Vanilla Rice Pudding with stewed plums and it feels like it’s high time for a vanilla pudding diet. (Instagram) •  You will never in this lifetime catch me in a pair of flip flop sandals. I’m allergic to them – it’s a hard no.  But rather strangely, I dug a forgotten pair of cute teva sandals  from the back of my closet and they’re the only shoes I want to wear right now.  (Teva) •  Deb has a new summer recipe for a very fresh Cucumber Crunch Salad with Tofu (which I bookmarked as Deb’s Cucumber Situation in my head after I saw the IG post). This has immediately found a spot at the top of the weeknight dinner menu.   (Smitten Kitchen) •  Speaking of our friend Deb, she has the best Ice Cream Sandwich recipe in her Keepers cookbook and I made them for the blog last summer and it’s totally ok if you forgot but… now’s a great time for a revisit. (Joy the Baker, Smitten Kitchen) •  I don’t make nearly enough corn fritters and I’m going to fix that this summer. (The Modern Proper) •  If you don’t live in the south you might not understand the importance of a pitcher of sweet tea in the fridge. It’s life-giving when you can literally gather the humidity up in your hands.  I learned these 3 Secrets For The Best Southern Sweet Tea from my friend Suzonne, but if you don’t have a big sister in Louisiana, the article will have to do.  (Southern Living) Friends, look forward to the next few Sunday posts from our friends Amy, Abby, and Karlee. We’re back in rotation, baby! And in the meantime, you can find me for frequently on Substack where I’ll offer some even more personal writing to paid subscribers. Have a wonderful day! My love to you. xo Joy 6 Responses Love you, friend. I’m still a Hebrew National girly for life, even if the blind taste test said different! Thank you for sharing the Robert Glazer piece ?? Happy Sunday Joy! I have a pair of Teva’s similar to the ones you have, but mine are over 10 years old. They have been with me to Disney, many different beaches including a few in Europe and Great Britain. They are so comfortable and have held up wonderfully. I have know how to swim forever but diving was never my strong suit. Don’t be to hard on yourself if your dives are not perfect. If I lived in Bellville, we would, for sure, become friends. I would come right to your front door or to your pool, where we could laugh at each other as we were learning to dive together. I already count you as a friend! Your posts are such an absolute joy to read, it’s hard to wait for your Sunday posts! You have a wonderful day too! P.S. My favorite hot dog; Natural all beef hot dogs from Trader Joe’s! I love a hot dog on the grill! Hi Joy! I can swim like a fish since before I could walk, but I’ve never been one to Dive! I’ve done it a few times, but it sure doesn’t come naturally and that’s okay! Good luck in your endeavors to become a Diver! You can do it! Thanks for all the wonderful summer recipes and things to do and read! Wishing you a very happy Summer!
