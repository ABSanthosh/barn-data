We’ve rounded up some of our favorite Thanksgiving pie recipes, from timeless classics to unexpected new favorites, that will have everyone asking for seconds. Whether you’re looking for an elevated pecan pie, a fresh take on apple, or a new spin on sweet potato, these recipes are sure to wow your guests and leave them wishing they had saved more room for dessert. Plus, the best part about pie is that you can prep it in advance—we recommend our fool-proof pie crust recipe, or for even fewer dishes, our stand-mixer pie dough. And, if you do run into any pie problems on the big day, check out our expert tips for all the quick fixes. 1. Maple \u0026 Milk Chocolate Chess Pie Made with an extra-buttery crust and topped with more flaky salt, this southern classic from Nea in our Test Kitchen strikes the perfect balance between sweet and salty. 2. Plant-based Bourbon Pecan Pie Pecan pie gets an upgrade from a smooth, bourbon-infused filling and perfectly toasted pecans—plus, it’s completely plant-based. 3. Buttermilk Sweet Potato If you’ve never quite loved pumpkin pie, this sweet potato version is for you. It uses similar warming spices but gets an added boost of richness from the buttermilk and a slightly caramelized flavor from the sweet potatoes. 4. Ginger Apple Crumble Pie Even if you’re not gluten- or dairy-free, you’ll love this twist on a classic. It’s filled with honeycrisp apples and a hint of fresh ginger. 5. Matcha Custard Pie Skip the after-dinner coffee and go straight for Four \u0026 Twenty Blackbirds’ matcha pie. It has a creamy, subtly earthy filling, and a crisp, buttery crust, making it the perfect, not-too-sweet dessert. 6. Classic Apple Pie It’s one of our most popular pie recipes for a reason. Sure, you could switch it up, but if you don’t want to overcomplicate things, or have other dishes to tackle, this recipe is a guaranteed winner. 7. Masala Spiced Pear Pie If you’re looking for something a little different but still comforting, this pie is your answer. The pears get tossed in a blend of aromatic spices and an optional kick of chili powder that will leave your kitchen smelling amazing. 8. Cider Cheesecake Pie This pie delivers the rich flavor of cheesecake, without the hassle of making one. Plus, spiced apple cider and nutmeg balance out the cream cheese to create the perfect filling.
