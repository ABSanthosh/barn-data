Sure, the weather gets cool, the air feels crisp, and the leaves changing colors is a sight to behold, but for a lot of people the best part of fall is celebrating Halloween. But thanks to a trend started by a Disney show called Gravity Falls, you can now start celebrating Halloween in the summer — it’s called Summerween!This year, Disney partnered up with Starbucks to celebrate Summerween by releasing a new kitchen collaboration that is so cute.Newly added to the shelves of retail stores throughout Disney Parks and the Disney Store online is the bewitching Haunted Mansion 24-ounce stainless steel Starbucks tumbler. Its design was inspired by the wallpaper of the beloved Disney attraction, and it comes with a reusable straw that has a bat-shaped straw cap, a subtle homage to the bat stanchions that adorn the queue at Walt Disney World. It also features the Starbucks logo on the side, giving fans the best of both iconic brands. The adorable cup sold out online shortly after it was released, but it’s still available in Disney Parks. It’s possible there will be a restock, though, so if you can’t make it to Disney this Summerween, there is hope yet. “I love, love, love this cup already! The gargoyle on the straw is the icing on the cake. Typical Starbucks cup that keeps ice cubes whole and drinks cold, easy to carry around, and it looks AWESOME!” wrote one happy Disney Store shopper. “I just received this yesterday, and it is more stunning in person than what you see in photos. An absolute must-have,” said another. A third reviewer who described it as “hauntingly beautiful” wrote, “It is so beautiful. I love that it is stainless steel because it will keep my ice water cooler longer.”",
