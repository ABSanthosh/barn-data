  "description": "May is a big month for us. It is busy and exciting and expensive because there are a bundle of birthdays (around 10 between our two families!) and Mother’s Day and our school year will be ending and while it has felt like Spring for a while here, May sets it straight. Strawberries and sunshine and bursting gardens and longer light. More so than a new calendar year, in May I feel a pull to write and remember and make goals and take stock of how I am spending my time - to both focus in and cast out a wider net for what could be. A New Years of sorts. I think it’s many of us, but for working moms in a different kind of way, this past year+ felt like so much surviving. That is a generalization, as circumstances vary widely I’m aware, but mothers shouldered a lot of the toughest parts. Quietly, keeping their game face on, but it was a lot. It felt like a day by day of keeping heads above water and constant pivoting. I feel a bit of exhale this season, even though this pandemic is not over over, it is better in our corner of the world, and I’m ready to reclaim some things of my own. I see the holes and my own excuses. The kids and I have this little diddy I do with them when Cur gets super wild with his buddies or I can see Cleo is on the verge of loosing it because she made a mistake on her picture: “Connect to your head (taps head), connect to your heart (taps heart) and slow down (slow hands).” My hope is that it brings them… us, into our own bodies when we can easily disconnect. It has hand motions of course because 5 and 7 years old, but it’s a simple mantra. Pay attention. You are already good. This past year was so wild! Connect to your head, connect to your heart, and slow down. And while you’re at it, springy bowls below because sauce makes everything better :) SPRING BOWLS WITH ALMOND ARUGULA PESTOServes 4This may make more pesto than you need, and is great to have on hand for eggs, sandwiches, dipping of any sorts. These bowls are satisfying as is, but can take a poached egg or whatever protein you have to throw on the grill or some rotiserrie chicken. No dairy? You can skip the parmesan in the pesto, no problem. Ingredients2 cloves garlic1/3 cup lightly toasted almonds, plus more for bowl garnish1 jalapeno or serrano, stemmed and seeded to taste3/4 tsp. sea saltjuice from one small lemon, about 4 Tbsp. 4 oz. arugula2 Tbsp. grated parmesan1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil12 oz. asparagus1 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil1/2 tsp. everyday/grilling seasoning blendsalt and pepper1 cup cooked lentils1 Tbsp. olive oil2 tsp. Dijon mustard2 Tbsp. champagne vinegar or apple cider vinegar1 Tbsp. minced shallothandful of minced chives2 cups cooked quinoa4 radishes, shaved2 avocados, quarteredDirectionsTo make the pesto, put the garlic, almonds, jalapeno and salt in a food processor and pulse to break them down. Add the lemon juice, arugula, parm and pulse a few more times. With the motor going, drizzle in the olive oil and run until you get the texture you want. I end up adding a small splash of water. Set aside. This can be made in advance and keep for a week or so in the fridge. Preheat the oven to 425’. Snap the ends off the asparagus and then use a peeler to clean up the bottom edges so they are smooth and tapered. It looks fancy, Ina does it, so we’re doing it too but you also don’t have to. Oil and season them and roast for 12 minutes until just tender but not mooshy.Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, combine the lentils with the olive oil, mustard, vinegar, shallot and a few pinches of salt and pepper and stir to combine. Add fresh chives, stir again. Assemble your bowls with some quinoa, dressed lentils, roasted asparagus and a few shaved radishes for garnish. Nestle in a wedge or two of avocado, puddle of pesto and some toasted almonds over top.
