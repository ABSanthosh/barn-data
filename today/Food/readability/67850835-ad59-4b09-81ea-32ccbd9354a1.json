Today I’m sharing my top 20 favorites – the things I think are really worth it in the sale. Most of these probably sound familiar because they are in my monthly favorites over and over again. Everything is something I have and love! You can find more of my picks here, as well as my amazon store front. My Top 20 Prime Day Favorites Tineco iFloor 3. I’ve mentioned this MANY times but it changed my life. I mean, not to be dramatic. It changed my cleaning life! This cleans my floors like NOTHING else. It is incredibly satisfying and cleans so well. There are some weeks when I use it daily! I also have another version for the larger floors in my house. It is equally as incredible and the battery and tank last a little longer. Kindle Paperwhite. I can’t live without my kindle these days. Max also has one and uses it constantly when we’re on the go. I take mine everywhere. I actually get anxious if I forget it at home! I also have the tiny kindle which I love to take in small bags or leave in my car so I always have it! Parchment Paper Sheets. I buy these over and over again. Can’t live in my kitchen without them! Breville Barista Touch. During prime day this past summer, I made an impulse purchase and oh my, was it wonderful. I love this and so does everyone who steps foot in my house! It’s like having a little coffee shop in your home. The coffee is incredible. Moccamaster Coffee Maker. If you’re more of a pot-of-coffee person, this is for you. We have one of these and I use it for all holidays, when I’m entertaining /have guests. Eddie doesn’t drink coffee and that’s the only reason I don’t use it daily. It makes excellent coffee! Breville the Smart Oven® Air Fryer Pro. This is one of my favorite kitchen appliances. I love having it in my kitchen to easily reheat items or make things like quick chicken fingers for the kids. Definitely my favorite air fryer too! Samsung Frame TV. If you’ve been considering a frame TV, this is the time to get one. Prime day is when we got ours before moving and we have two in our house – our kitchen and bedroom. I love it even more than I thought. Especially in the kitchen! It’s such a fun way to add a variety of art or holiday color to the room. Everyone always thinks it’s actual art too. This is the frame I have around it. wernies No Show Socks. Best socks ever! They do not slip at all. I have repurchased these many many times. Bose Quiet Comfort Headphones. I have tried every version of headphones imaginable. These are my current favorite and what I’ve been using the most. I love how they are not heavy on the head. They are very comfortable. Beckham Hotel Collection Bed Pillows. A few years ago I was googling the best pillows. I’ve done this many times and we’ve never been satisfied. But 3 or 4 years ago we got these (and have since replaced once or twice!) and they are INCREDIBLE. We both love them. We have the king version. Clean skin club facial towels. I’ve been using these for over a year every night and I swear they’ve changed my skin. I was going through so many towels to ensure I always had a clean one for my face, and with little kids and hand washing, it was hard to determine that. I LOVE these – they are so convenient and easy to use. Cordless Dust Buster. We have three of these! They live in all corners of the house and garage and are so easy to prop up on the charger. We also use them for our cars. Our Place Griddle Pan. I LOVE this. I use it as a baking dish mostly – it’s so much nicer than a sheet pan and is excellent quality. Nanit Pro Smart Baby Monitor. I got this in 2021 when I had Jordan and it was one of the best purchases. I love it. I travel with it and still use it every night. Little Tikes Bounce House. I don’t know how we survived 2020 without a mini bounce house – and we STILL use it constantly. The kids love this and it fits in our basement and also works outside. Magnatiles. Possibly the most versatile toy ever – my kids (ages 10 to 3) all still adore magnatiles. They keep them busy and are easy transportable. They have built some really cool things with them! Toniebox. Jordan absolutely loved his Toniebox. It is incredible and I wish these existed when Max was his age! Yoto Mini. This is what Emilia and Max have – it’s like the toniebox but for older kids. Emilia has used hers every single day for YEARS. She listens to it at night, we take it in the car, on vacation, everything. Osea Body Balm. I love all Osea products, but this balm feels incredible on the skin. Almost like a serum. I use it right after the shower, before the oil. Wall Charger, Surge Protector. I have a few of these and I like to travel with them. They are also great in the kitchen. We all have so many different devices these days that having this is necessary.
