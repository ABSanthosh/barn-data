This week’s lineup comes from home cook Christen Vidanovic, who’s all about making the most of summer produce. By the beginning of July, I’m usually pretty settled in my summer routines: barefoot in the grass, flipping something on the grill, and waving to friends pulling up with drinks and kids in tow. It’s the kind of month where the lines between weekday and weekend blur—camp days melt into sunset picnics, and dinner is usually on the deck. During the peak of summer, the farmers market isn’t an errand—it’s an adventure. I come home with armfuls of stone fruit and herbs, zucchini and tomatoes, often without a plan. That’s the spirit this week’s meal plan taps into: flexible, flavorful dishes that let the season shine, whether you’re cooking for one or feeding a crowd. There’s a mix of grill-friendly dinners, low-effort lunch ideas, and a couple sweet ways to make the most of all that summer fruit. Breakfast: Caramelized Peach Pancakes A satisfying way to start the day. Prep the peaches ahead so all you have to do is pour and flip. Lunch: Grilled Zucchini Orzo Perfect for a picnic or a sunny stoop lunch. Grill the veggies with dinner the night before and lunch basically makes itself. Dinner 1: Shrimp Tacos with Charred Corn \u0026 Peach Salsa Juicy grilled shrimp meets sweet corn and peach salsa in a taco that tastes like a summer party. Margaritas are optional. Dinner 2: Tomato Salad with Grilled Corn, Feta \u0026 Hazelnuts A no-cook stunner. Grill your corn ahead, then toss everything together for a light but satisfying dinner. Top with rotisserie chicken or a soft-boiled egg to make it a meal. Dessert: Summer Skillet Cobbler Bubbling summer fruit under a biscuit-y topping, baked in one pan. Use whatever fruit you’ve got on hand. Produce • 6–8 peaches (4 for pancakes + salsa, 2–4 for cobbler) • 4 medium zucchini (3 for orzo + 1 for hash or fritters) • 4 ears of corn (2 for tacos, 2 for salad) • 4 medium tomatoes (for salad) • 1 small eggplant (optional addition to grill) • 2 summer squash (optional, grill for lunch bowls) • 1 head garlic • 2 medium onions (1 for salsa, 1 for general use) • 3 limes (for salsa + dressing) • 2 jalapeños (for salsa) • 1 bunch fresh mint (for salad + optional hash) • 1 bunch fresh basil • 1 bunch fresh parsley • Optional: ½ lb tomatillos (for extra salsa prep) Dairy \u0026 Eggs • 1 dozen eggs • 8 oz feta cheese • 1 stick unsalted butter (for pancakes + cobbler) Meat \u0026 Fish • 1½ lbs shrimp, peeled and deveined (for tacos) • Optional: Rotisserie chicken or ½ lb steak (for topping salad) Pantry • 1 lb orzo or other small pasta • Olive oil (at least ½ cup) • Vinegar (white wine or apple cider, for dressing) • Pantry spices: cumin, chili flakes, cinnamon, sugar, baking powder • ½ cup hazelnuts (for salad) • All-purpose flour (for pancakes + cobbler) • Brown sugar or raw sugar (for cobbler topping) • 1 package small tortillas (8–10 count) 1. Grill once, eat twice: Grill extra zucchini, corn, and summer squash while you’re cooking dinner—those veggies become the base for salads, orzo, or even a breakfast hash later in the week. 2. Leftover love Extra grilled veggies can get tossed with pasta, stuffed into quesadillas, or blitzed into a vinaigrette. 3. Stretch your staples Use tortillas for tacos, then turn extras into lunch quesadillas or veggie chilaquiles. 4. Salsa smart Make one big batch of salsa (like the charred peach + corn version), and use it as a topping for tacos, eggs, or even grilled meat later in the week. 5. Need a side? Try these Zucchini-Corn Fritters with Spicy Yogurt Dipping Sauce alongside the Tomato Salad with Grilled Corn, Feta \u0026 Hazelnuts. Crisp, golden, and packed with summer flavor. What are you making with your farmer's market haul?",
