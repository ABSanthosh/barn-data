The bill faces changes before it reaches Mr. Trump’s desk, but the Senate has already voted unanimously for a No Tax on Tips measure. The new bill will make the change effective from 2026 to 2028. How will it affect food-industry workers and diners? Here’s what we’ve learned from interviews with tax lawyers, hospitality professors and industry groups:How are restaurant employees currently taxed on tips?The federal tax code requires that every tip be reported as income. Whether it’s a $20 bill handed to a host, a line filled in on a check or a button pressed on a keypad, employees and employers are required to track and report every cent. This applies whether each worker keeps the tips or the money is pooled and redistributed.What counts as a tip?In the tax code and in this legislation, the term “cash tip” applies to tips given in bills and coins, on a credit or debit card, or via the business’s electronic payment system. It has not yet been determined whether tips that go directly to a server via a service like Venmo or PayPal would qualify as cash. Service charges, which are legal in some places, are added by the business and do not count as tips.What will the new bill do?It will make tip income exempt from federal income taxes. That amount will be subtracted from reported income as an “above the line” deduction on a tax return. That will reduce how much income tax is owed. The tips will still have to be tracked and reported.Who will get the deduction?There is debate over who will benefit from the measure, which applies to all tipped workers in the restaurant business, including not only servers but also baristas, food delivery drivers and anyone holding out a payment screen after they have sold you food. According to government data, there are more than two million tipped restaurant workers in the United States.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
