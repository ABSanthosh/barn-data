Here’s a guide for finding treasures among the vast choices.Credit...Luke WohlgemuthApril 24, 2025Updated 3:22 p.m. ETHave I ever shared my strategy for touring big art museums?

But if I pick just a few small galleries to visit, I know I will leave fulfilled, enlightened and satisfied.Wine today is a lot like a big art museum.I’ve written often of the astounding diversity of wines available to wine lovers at this moment. The sheer number of widely available choices is unlike anything in the many centuries’ history of wine.But the opportunity to drink this vast variety comes with a downside: selection paralysis. It’s easy to be so crushed by the assortment that you either fall back on something familiar — pinot grigio, again? — or turn away from wine entirely.I have been so focused on the joys of discovery that I haven’t paid nearly enough attention to the dangers of too many choices. But they are real. It seems sad that the glorious opportunity to try wines in so many different styles from so many places should have this pernicious effect. I’d like to propose a solution.Let’s focus on a small subset of the choices available today. Rather than the hundreds of different kinds of wine that you can find in a good shop, let’s narrow the selection down to, say, those made with 10 grapes. As with the art museum, tightening the parameters comes with a big payoff. Concentrating on a smaller number eliminates the agony of selection and permits clear concentration.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
