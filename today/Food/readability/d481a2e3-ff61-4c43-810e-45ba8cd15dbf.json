  "text": "“I was looking for a simple roasted carrot recipe on your site and couldn’t find one,” a friend told me a month ago and I immediately put “simple roasted carrot recipe” on my sprawling, decades-long To Cook list because sometimes I forget myself, too. Spoiler: I was never going to write a simple recipe for roasted carrots. I mean, sure, there’s one within this recipe. My carrot-roasting philosophy [moment of pause for my gratitude that I have a little corner of the internet where I get to write about things like a carrot roasting “philosophy” and only a few of you will roll your eyes] is that they’re within the category of vegetables that need to be steam-roasted (see also: artichokes) because roasting them doesn’t necessarily soften the centers before they burn. So, we start cooking the carrots in a steamy environment until tender, then roast the rest of the way uncovered until browned and crisp. You could stop there. But I want dinner, not something limited to being a side dish. And for that, we add lentils and yogurt. A sharp vinaigrette with lemon, garlic, cumin, oregano, and olive oil is used to dress lentils and then roasted carrots are rolled in a splash of this. The lentils are spooned over on a puddle of plain Greek yogurt on a plate, the carrots go on top, more lentils and dressing and a big fistful of herbs go over that and you will try this and entirely forget about the concept of a serving size. It is 4? 2? If you decide it’s just one, I do not judge, only encourage, a kindness I ask you to pay forward when I tell you that the leftovers, should there be any, are shockingly good mixed un-aesthetically and eaten cold from the fridge. Something new! I’m so excited to announce the special audiobook edition of Smitten Kitchen Keepers, Smitten Kitchen Keepers: A Kitchen Counter Conversation! Available on November 12th and read by me, I hope it feels exactly like you’ve pulled up a chair and I’m hanging out in the kitchen with you, discussing techniques, substitutions, and chatting about what I think makes each recipe special. Bonus recipe: When you purchase the audiobook, you will receive a signed holiday card from me with a bonus recipe! To receive your card and recipe, complete the form with your purchase order number right here. [US Residents, 18+. Ends December 13, 2024.] Podcast! A new episode of my podcast with J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, The Recipe with Kenji and Deb, is out and it’s all about Baked Ziti. You can listen to it anywhere you get your podcasts and catch up on any episodes you’ve missed right here. New episodes drop every other Monday. I hope you enjoy listening as much as we’re enjoying the conversation. Roasted Carrots with Lentils and Yogurt Notes: If you’re buying carrots with the greens on top, buy extra as the greens on top carry a lot of weight. Carrots are going to vary in thickness, which will affect their cooking times; you might need more or less time to get them tender in the steam. Thin ones might brown faster. My favorite lentil product is Trader Joe’s vacuum-packed steamed lentils from the fridge case. They’re utterly perfectly cooked and even seasoned. I’ve also kept unopened packages in the fridge for, uh, months and lived to tell about it but please do not take my risk aversion as a food safety recommendation. My favorite dried lentils are Sabarot French Green Lentils. Carrots and assembly2 pounds (905 grams) carrots, peeled and trimmed1 cup (235 ml) waterOlive oilKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper1 1/2 cups cooked or 3/4 cup (135 grams) dried lentils de puy1/3 cup (or a big handful) finely chopped flat-leaf parsley1 cup (235 grams) plain Greek yogurt Dressing6 tablespoons (90 ml) olive oil3 tablespoons (45 ml) lemon juice1 garlic clove, minced1/2 teaspoon ground cumin3/4 teaspoon kosher salt1/2 teaspoon chili flakes, or to taste1/2 teaspoon dried oregano Roast the carrots: Heat your oven to 450°F (230°C). Place carrots and water on a sheet pan and cover tightly with foil. Steam in the oven for 30 minutes, or until carrots are tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. Carefully remove foil (steam burns! and I always forget), drain any water left in pan, and drizzle carrots with a few tablespoons of olive oil, kosher salt, and freshly ground black pepper and roll them around in it, making sure there are no stuck parts. Return to the oven uncovered and roast until carrots are browned, about another 20 to 25 minutes. [See note up top.] Meanwhile, cook your lentils: Cook dried lentils in salted water according to the package directions, then drain and set aside. Make the vinaigrette: Combine dressing ingredients in a jar and shake well to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. I’m aiming for a sharp, lemony vinaigrette here that will wake up the cooked lentils. Assemble right before eating: Pour all but last two tablespoons of vinaigrette over lentils and mix. Season to taste with additional salt and pepper, if needed. Stir in all but last two tablespoons of parsley. Spoon yogurt directly onto a serving plate and use the back of a spoon to swirl it to coat the bottom. Spoon 3/4 of lentil salad over yogurt. When carrots come out of the oven, pour remaining dressing over carrots in the pan, rolling them in it, and then lay the cooked carrots on top of the lentils. Spoon remaining lentils around the carrots and sprinkle platter with remaining parsley. Eat right away. Do ahead: I’d keep the elements separate until serving so each element tastes distinct. However, for unglamorous leftovers, everything mixed in a container is surprisingly delicious. Post navigation",
