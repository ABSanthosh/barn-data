If you’re looking for an easy and indulgent chocolate cookie recipe, these are perfect for Valentine’s Day or anytime you need a simple, sweet treat which is, in fact, everyday.There’s something about February that sinks in with a bit of dread for me… like here we are, lowkey trapped in the uncertainty and surprises of another year. Maybe it’s the fact that everyone stops saying “Happy New Year’ and we’re just here… with the sun setting early and fresh watermelon still months away. But, even if we enter February a little ravaged by January, we can still find some ease if we insist on it.We’re creeping—ever so slowly—toward spring. I know this because I just bought an unreasonable amount of zinnia seeds for the garden and have roped a few gentlemen into building a new fence for the pasture to keep the dogs from excitedly running around the town. It’s all in preparation for the kind of days where we (Will and I outnumbered by dogs) can linger outside a little longer, soaking up every precious second of our short Texas spring.But for now, we bake. These Double Chocolate Olive Oil Cookies are rich, deeply fudgy, and just the right amount of indulgent (which is to say, VERY). The olive oil keeps them impossibly moist, with a chew that lingers for days.  They somehow get better a few days after they’re baked. These feel like the perfect Valentine’s Day bake—uncomplicated but special, best shared over coffee, or straight from the baking sheet while they’re still warm.  Pro Tip: The baked cookies also freeze exceptionally well and I’ve been known to eat them from frozen.DescriptionIf you’re looking for an easy and indulgent chocolate cookie recipe, these are perfectly rich and chewy and stay irresistible for days after baking.2 cups (240 grams) all-purpose flour¾ cup (75 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder1 teaspoon baking soda¾ teaspoon kosher salt¾ cup extra virgin olive oil2 large eggs, at room temperature2 tablespoons strong coffee, cooled2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract2 cups (400 grams) granulated sugar1 heaping cup dark chocolate chips, chunks, or disks, plus more for toppingFlaky sea salt for topping Cook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark In a medium bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, and baking soda. Once sifted and fluffy, whisk in the kosher salt.In a large bowl whisk together olive oil, eggs, coffee, and vanilla extract. Whisk in sugar. Add the wet ingredients all at once to the dry ingredients and use a rubber spatula to mix into a smooth and shiny batter. Just before all of the flour is incorporated, fold in the chocolate pieces.Cover the bowl of batter with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight.Just before you’re ready to bake, place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove the dough from the fridge and scoop into small 2 teaspoon size cookies. Place on the prepared baking sheet about 2-inches apart. Sprinkle each cookie with sea salt and dot a few more chocolate pieces on top. Bake for 8-10 until dry across the edges.
