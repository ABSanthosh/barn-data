  "description": "We planned this trip pre-pandemic. It got rescheduled three times and by the time we were actually going, I didn’t think the four of us needed any more time with each other. The kids had been extra bickery and Cleo had been a bit of a loose cannon and Hugh and I, who run a tight web of work/love/family life all together, all the time, had been feeling like all the margin and space had been sucked out of that web since March. But I also needed out. I needed new. Turns out we all did, and we liked each other more, in a different space. That’s the take away - GET OUT!Here we all are in our first trip together to Yosemite National Park. We stayed at Autocamp - a charming airstream resort of trailers about 45 minutes from the parks entrance. Yes, I did get a trade discount, no, this is not sponsored but I wish it was because I want to go back already. The kids LOVED it. It was perfect for their age and I appreciated the detail that no cars were allowed inside the camp area so they could run free and I didn’t need to worry about that. They were convinced we’d see climbers working their way up the face of El Cap (thank you, Free Solo on Netflix) and I was ready for some scenery that was not within the 15 mile radius of our home. I’ve lived in California my whole life and this was my first visit to Yosemite.  Hitting the road and landing somewhere so magical was really something. Sure, there were still meltdowns and miscommunications but it felt like a real break from our day to day. It was obviously breathtaking (these photos!!) but also the shake up that we all needed.  View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize I shared some photos on instagram of Autocamp, the Airstream trailer glamping place we stayed and many of you asked for a review, so I’ll log a few thoughts here for reference. We have tent camped and car camped but found it immeasurably easier to drive up to an equipped trailer with a pool on the property and mini kitchen set-up. I know this convenience comes at an expense, and especially with young kids (mine 4.5 and 6 at the time), I would absolutely pay for this again so long as I am able. It cut the prep and clean up significantly. We stayed in one of the Accessible Suites which had a nice porch area and more space inside for all four of us. When we go back, would be fun to sync up with a few families and book trailers together. The airstream trailers looked great too, and by the looks of the layout, I would suggest to get one that is up the hill from the lobby, not down. There just seemed to be a little more space and a nicer view from some. It is located in Midpines, where there is not much going on. Do not go without a Yosemite park pass. I mean there is a bus/shuttle but especially with the kids and gear for the day, having the car was important. Food options and markets in Midpines are limited, so if you go planning to do take-out, know that there truly isn’t much and what is there, isn’t great. We didn’t have a pass into the park the first day, and thought we’d find hikes in the area and didn’t find much. We took a drive into Bass Lake, about an hour away, and spent some time at the pool. The drive into the park is beautiful and we didn’t mind it. Listened to this audio book and loved it. You all also asked for my food plan, so you could have easy ideas. I cook all the time, I did not feel obligated to woo my family with impressive camp cuisine. We kept things simple. I’ll link to some of these recipes, but know many come from SK Cooking Club, where recipes and bundles can be purchased a la carte if you are not a monthly subscriber. If anything, I just hope it gives you ideas.

No gluten? Use a gluten-free all-purpose flour like Bob’s Red Mill or Cup for Cup. No dairy? Use almond milk with a small squeeze of lemon juice and coconut oil as replacements. No eggs? They won’t have as much lift, but a small, mashed, overripe banana will help them hold. This makes a lot of pancakes. Leftovers pack well in lunchboxes with a swipe of nut or seed butter, or the dry and wet mixes can be easily halved, so this can cover you for two mornings. For the wet ingredients2 eggs1 1/2 cups of buttermilk or non-dairy milk of choice2 Tbsp. of melted butter or oil - plus more for cookingyogurt (for serving)maple syrup (for serving)mixed berry (for serving) For the dry mix1 1/2 cups of unbleached all purpose flour1/2 cup of quick-cooking oats3 Tbsp. of ground flaxmeal or bran1 Tbsp. of chia seeds (optional)4 Tbsp. of cane sugar1 tsp. of baking powder1/2 tsp. of baking soda1/2 tsp. of ground cinnamonpinch of grated nutmeg (optional)1/2 tsp. of sea saltDirectionsIn a large bowl, whisk together all of the dry ingredients until well combined. Store in a jar or an airtight container until ready to use.When ready to useIn a mixing bowl, really whip up your eggs. We want a lot of air up in there to get them fluffy. Add the buttermilk or alternative, oil or butter, and continue to whisk to combine. Add all of the dry mix (if you're halving things, use half the wet ingredients as well) and fold them in just until just combined. Do not overmix! Want to stir in chocolate chips or blueberries? Now is the time.Heat your oil or butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook your pancakes about 2 minutes per side. We serve ours with plain yogurt, berries and a sprinkle or granola for texture!
