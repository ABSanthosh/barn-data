My husband is ketchup’s biggest cheerleader, while my son will eat anything that is glazed in teriyaki sauce. My condiment of choice is mustard. The spicy zing of mustard is so appealing that I’ve yet to find a salad dressing, sandwich, or side dish that mustard doesn’t make better. I’ve tried dozens of mustards, from sweet honey mustard to whole grain Dijon varieties, and have a refrigerator door of mustards to show for it. Yet the one that I reach for no matter what is on the table comes from everyone’s favorite discount grocer: Aldi. Burman’s Spicy Brown Mustard earned the summer superlative for most delicious mustard in my house. If you haven’t tried it yet, there’s no better time than summer to pick up a bottle. What’s So Great About Burman’s Spicy Brown Mustard?Spicy brown mustard is made from ground brown mustard seeds, vinegar, and salt. Turmeric is often added for color. This style of mustard is usually mixed with less vinegar to let the spice from the brown mustard seeds stand out. Spicy brown mustard adds nuanced flavor to side dishes and spreads. Every brand has its own balance of flavor, and for my taste Burman’s Spicy Brown Mustard from Aldi is the best of the bunch. If you tried to add the same spice, tang, and savory flavor without this bottle of mustard, you’d have to reach for a handful of ingredients. At my other nearby grocery store in Tampa, Florida, a 12-ounce bottle of store-brand spicy brown mustard costs $2.65, while at Aldi, Burman’s Spicy Brown Mustard costs just $1.49 for the same size package. I’m grateful for any amount of grocery savings — especially because I add a dollop of this mustard to most of my favorite summer foods. What’s the Best Way to Enjoy Burman’s Spicy Brown Mustard?Spicy brown mustard is the ingredient I add to many of my favorite summer recipes (sweet summer desserts excluded, of course). This time of year I’m always preparing sandwiches for a crowd. Sometimes the sandwiches are taken to camp, other times to work, and on the best days they are served at the beach. The ingredient that sets my sandwiches apart is a swipe of Burman’s Spicy Brown Mustard. A summertime spread isn’t complete without a bowl of potato salad or pasta salad to share, and you know that your recipe is good when the bowl is empty at the end of the afternoon. This spicy brown mustard is my secret for the absolute best picnic-style sides. Of course, I can’t talk about summer foods and mustard without mentioning smoky sausages and hot dogs. Each deserves a drizzle of the spicy sauce. Find it in stores: Burman’s Spicy Brown Mustard, $1.49 for 12 ouncesWhat Aldi pantry staples are you stocking up on this summer?
