Today we’re taking comfort in small bits of joy like, how well a bird can hold a grudge, apples baked with butter, and how dogs are perfect people.I’ll tell you what-  I’m ready to pull down the Christmas tree. I’m ready for the twinkling lights of a Christmas tree on the front porch along with all the tacky tree decorations I blacked out and bought at Dollar Tree in July.  I’m ready to plant the spring bulbs in the garden beds I’ve sheet mulched (and the dogs have subsequently dug holes in thaaaanks).  I’m ready to plant sage and thyme in the window boxes.  I’m ready to stock my freezer with turkey and dinner rolls. I’m ready for the comfort and care portion of the holiday season and I think we’re allowed to start that now.Here’s the offering this week! Take good care, friends!•  If You think You Can Hold a Grudge, Consider the Crow Brilliant, but are they petty? (NYTimes Gift Link)•  Here’s one way out of where we’re stuck:  Students building bridges across the American divide with the American Exchange Program.  High school kids, not going overseas, but to American towns that are politically and s0cio-economically different from the one they’ve been raised in.  I’m nodding my head yes. (CBS, American Exchange Program)•  What It Means if You’re Wholly Numb Right Now – And How To Cope (Self)•  How do you feel about the Chaos Method of decluttering? It stresses me out but maybe that stress morphs into motivation to see the floor again? (Apartment Therapy)•  What to watch this weekend? Quincy, co-directed by his daughter Rashida Jones. (Netflix)•  This Modern Proper salad has inspired the majority of my lunches this week.  I love a warm roasted veggie with crisp apples and creamy goat cheese in salad.  The move these days is to chop a salad fine then stuff in fresh fluffy pita.  (Instagram, Joy the Baker)•  Can we talk about Thanksgiving gravy?  We’re weeks away, it’s not too soon.  My neighbor here in Bellville happens to be a chef (an elite neighbor) and has offered to fry turkeys (yes, plural!) for our big Thanksgiving bash.  As perfect as that is for freeing up precious oven space, it does beg the question, “what do we do about the gravy without turkey drippings?”.  My current options are this Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy (made with roasted turkey wings) OR this jar of gravy starter from Williams Sonoma that piques my interest.  (Taste of Home, Williams Sonoma)•  In J. Kenji we trust: The Food Lab’s Creamed Spinach Recipe (Serious Eats)•  This holiday season requires a puzzle table. It’s peaceful. (Piecework Puzzles)•  Did I hear you say you wanted to make Aunt Ina’s Apple Pie Bars? (Joy the Baker)•  In the tiny corner of my mind that’s concerned with health and wellness, I’m highly motivated to not get sick this flu season as, admittedly, I’m such a baby of a sick person.  To keep all systems go, I’ve mixed this rather intense Anima Mundi Green Powder with orange juice and water every morning. Also, a jar of whole fermented garlic cloves and honey seems like it can cure just about anything so that’s on the To Do List.  (Amazon, Simply Recipes)•  Our friend Timothy makes the best playlists and I’m currently enjoying his Wind Down playlist at night as I’m cleaning the kitchen before bed.  Additionally, we need to make a batch of Timmy’s Firecrackers (a seasoned and marinated Saltine cracker) for any and all holiday guests this season. (Instagram, Spotify, Mississippi Vegan)•  The Cure has a new album and I think I like it very much.  Simplistically, it sounds good in my house these days. Something about how a particular album bounces off the walls either feels right or wrong.  Songs of a Lost World (Spotify)•  I’ve been splurging on my skincare products lately with, namely, these Dr. Gross daily peels (that I use every other day), this Caudalie Beauty Elixir and Vinoperfect Serum.  I’m going into winter smooth and bright.  To my wallet’s dismay, these products workwork (and they’re honestly cheaper than monthly facials).•  The dogs were good again this week. (TikTok)Have a lovely Sunday friends. Let’s go outside.My love to you.xo Joy 16 ResponsesJust want to say I love, love, love the playlist!!I signed out of socials last week and so missed the good dogs. Thank you for providing an outlet for tears this morning. (A coping mechanism has been to watch/read something that makes me cry every day so I can release tears without dwelling on our terrible country.)Ina Apple Pie bars-yes warmed with vanilla bean ice cream.My daughter in law and her family do the fry the turkey for our Thanksgiving- new to me over past few years. Fried turkey is surprisingly moist on the inside, crispy on the outside. I make gravy head with roasted turkey wings.The numbness is serving me well right now.Thx for the heads up on the Cure’s new release. Music has been my salvation this week!? and I’m thoroughly enjoying the Cure this afternoon!For Aggressive Crows: use an empty soda can, put a strong rubber band around the can. When you pull back on the rubber band the loud “Pop” sound scares the Crows away immediately. We have a Murder of Crows in our neighborhood and they’ll Caw like crazy when we sit outside. So using the empty soda can makes them fly off. They may come back \u0026 sit on the parameter of our yard, but they’re quiet. This doesn’t work for Squirrels…haIf I could have a dog that dispensed back scratching on command, I might not care who was president. Edna Jean is everything.I seem to recall that Kenji had a good method for making turkey gravy without the whole bird, I think he used a separate batch of wings. Or maybe it was Michael Ruhlmann. I’ll have to see if I can find it and repost it here.The words you shared on coping were helpful as were the dog videos. What a week this has been. I am not ready for Christmas lights, but I am starting to think about gravy recipes. Hang on and keep looking for joy.Thanks for the Chaos method article. Going to try that in my storage locker, I mean spare bedroom. Also Ina’s apple pie bars are amazing“how well a bird can hold a grudge” I needed this laugh. My dog, Birdie, holds a grudge against anyone that ever barked at her when she was a puppy. Dogs are indeed perfect people.The Williams Sonoma gravy base is great! My cousin, who is the world’s greatest hostess, recommended it to me the first year that I hosted Thanksgiving, and it was a lifesaver. It’s gluten-free, too, though the website does say that it’s not made in a GF facility. Highly recommend!We don’t deserve dogs but I sure am glad we have them.Why not roast a turkey in advance, put the meat in your freezer for later, and save the drippings for your Thanksgiving gravy?P.S. another netflix, show “Martha” – it is right on point for the times.Kitchen Basics Turkey Broth is all I need for the gravy. We grill our whole turkey, weber grill, the drippings are just too strong, I’ve tried, and we are eating healthy, low on fat. Add a bit of thyme or your seasoning of choice. \u0026 yes I’m numb, and everthing else, \u0026 trying to not destroy all the good progress I’ve made this year. We are not going back?Leave a Reply This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.",

When you pull back on the rubber band the loud “Pop” sound scares the Crows away immediately. We have a Murder of Crows in our neighborhood and they’ll Caw like crazy when we sit outside. So using the empty soda can makes them fly off. They may come back \u0026amp; sit on the parameter of our yard, but they’re quiet.
