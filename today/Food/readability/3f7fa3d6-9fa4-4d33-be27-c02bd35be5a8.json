The warehouse store is constantly stocking unique treats, from its Girl Scouts thin mint pretzels to frozen chocolate-covered strawberries. The brand is always dropping grocery gems that keep its customers coming back, and recently people on Reddit found a new item that might be this season’s must-try.If you peruse the aisles of Costco, you might come across Cape Cod Infused Tuscan Herb chips, which Reddit users are calling “so good.”A few weeks ago, Cape Cod posted on Instagram to announce the launch of its new chip flavor: Tuscan Herb. The caption read, “Introducing new Cape Cod Infused Tuscan Herb flavored chips. Crafted with gourmet, Tuscan herb-infused sea salt — simply perfection. Now available exclusively at Costco.”The kettle-cooked potato chips are seasoned with a salt crafted with Tuscan herbs, including basil, rosemary, and garlic, and deliver the signature crunch Cape Cod is known for. Reddit users have pointed out that the flavor has a distinct “pizza” vibe.While Cape Cod Infused Tuscan Herb chips aren’t available for purchase online through Costco’s website, you can find a 25-ounce bag in stores for $7.99.Once you get your hands on a bag of these Tuscan-inspired chips, you can toss a handful onto your next charcuterie board, add them to an Italian sub for extra crunch, or crumble them into your breadcrumb mix the next time you make chicken or eggplant Parmesan.The hype around these chips is real. When Cape Cod announced the release of the new flavor, fans flooded the comments to express their excitement. One person wrote, “Thank you! I just picked some up at Costco. I’ve been dying for some ever since maybe 2015-2017. I think it was Cape Cod that had the basil garlic rosemary flavor kettle-cooked chips. I was obsessed. These taste just like them but maybe a tad more garlicky, which is good.”",
