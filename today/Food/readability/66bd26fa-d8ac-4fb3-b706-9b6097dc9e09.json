  "description": "The Hotline gets so many questions about great recipes to make with young folks. To us, the perfect kid-friendly cooking projects should contain few ingredients, require very little prep, avoid too much work with knives or the stove and, maybe most importantly, create something sweet. These 3 Ingredient Nutella Brownies fit that bill perfectly. All you need is flour, eggs and a jar of nutella. The nutella contains all the fat, flavor and chocolatey goodness necessary to create a killer brownie. The only “work” that this recipe needs is to heat the nutella in the microwave just slightly, so that it's easily combined with the eggs. From Our Shop Sale!

Set up a brownie bar for a sleep over where each child can make their own batch where they can add anything they want. Also I’m confident you could make incredible bars with any similar spreadable nut paste, such as peanut butter or almond butter. Or, you could try using cookie butter like I did in the video above. 1 (13 oz.) jar of Nutella 2 large eggs, whisked ½ cup all-purpose flour Preheat the oven to 350º F. Prepare an 8x8 baking dish with parchment, leaving an overhang. Transfer Nutella to a medium, microwave safe bowl. Microwave in 10 second increments until loose, about 30 seconds. Let cool slightly. Whisk in the eggs, a bit at a time, until fully incorporated. Fold in flour until no white streaks remain. Transfer batter to the prepared baking dish. Bake until the center is just set but still fudgey, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven, let cool slightly, before transferring brownies to a wire rack. Once fully cooled, slice and serve.
