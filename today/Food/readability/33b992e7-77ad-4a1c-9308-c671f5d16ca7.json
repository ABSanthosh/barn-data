  "text": "Hi! We are back after the summer with a vegan take on Caesar Salad. Or, the focus here is actually more on the mushrooms and the salad is just one way to serve them. I (David) posted this recipe as a little Lunch Therapy cookalong on my instagram last week but thought I'd put it here as well to make it easier to return to, print or just cook in your own tempo.We haven't been posting new recipes for a while since we have just gone through with our big move to Denmark. Everything is still very new and pretty chaotic to be honest as we are trying to find our way in our new house. But the kids are doing well and have adapted quickly to their new schools, Luise is doing her midwife internship at a Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen and I'm working on starting a Green Kitchen Studio here in Copenhagen (email me if you think you'd be a good fit in the team, currently looking for a junior recipe developer). We'll share more about us and the move in another post once we are further settled in. Today, it's all about this shroom salad!I kept seeing this cool way of searing mushrooms on several sources online. The technique is that you press them between two pans on medium high heat so they release liquids and get a really crunchy outer texture. And then add a marinade that they soak up and become packed with flavor. I think the technique is credited to Derek Sarno and the result is pretty remarkable and the texture reminded me almost of chicken (although don't take my word for it, I haven't eaten chicken in 25 years). Anyway, they get both crunchy and juicy flavorful at the same time. You can see how I do it in this reels video. We serve the mushrooms with an easy vegan caesar that we make by simply tossing romaine lettuce in a dead simple dressing with just vegan mayo, a splash of vinegar and capers instead of the traditional anchovies and warm chickpeas instead of croutons. It's a truly delicious meal. Promise. Let us know what you think if you try it!",
