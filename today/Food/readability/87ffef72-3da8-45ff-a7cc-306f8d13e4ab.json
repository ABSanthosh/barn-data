Granted, I was in college before I started writing for The Kitchn, so I bought pretty much everything with convenience in mind. I’ve spent the past year and a half learning what I was missing out on with that mindset, gradually upgrading my cookware collection to include other materials like stainless steel. Now, I have pieces that I know I can rely on and hold onto for years to come.Until recently, I considered cast iron a whole new ball game. Even though I’ve heard my coworkers sing its praises, I couldn’t help but think about all of the various maintenance rules that I’ve come across. However, I kept seeing more and more about how cast-iron pans really do last forever, and with the start of the new year, I’ve made it my mission to break out of my comfort zone. So far, Smithey’s No. 6 Skillet has been the perfect introduction into cast iron, thanks to its mini size, rapid heat-up time, and easy-to-clean surface.What Is the Smithey No. 6 Skillet?Those of you that are cast-iron connoisseurs have probably at least heard of the South Carolina-based brand — if you haven’t already tried one of its skillets for yourself, that is. Since its inception in 2015, the brand has expanded its offerings beyond heirloom quality cast-iron pans to include gorgeous carbon steel pieces as well as Dutch ovens and griddles. Rochelle, one of our contributors and a classically trained cook, called its No. 12 Skillet “one of the best cast-iron pans” she’s ever owned. (You can read more about it here.)So, I figured if I was going to start somewhere, Smithey’s mini pan would be ideal. It embodies the term “tiny but mighty,” measuring 6 inches across in total with a 4.8-inch cooking surface and 1.3-inch depth. Weighing 2.7 pounds, the size makes it suited for cooking and baking individual portions or serving dips and appetizers to a crowd. The interior is polished, smooth, and pre-seasoned with several coats of pure grape seed oil. The result is a chemical-free, nearly nonstick surface that cleans easily. The holes on either end for hanging, pour spouts, and logo-embossed handle round out its design features.Why I Love the Smithey No. 6 SkilletMy first fear going into using cast iron for the first time was that it would be too heavy to wield, which is why I’m so glad I went with the mini version. On top of being a great size for my cramped kitchen — it doesn’t take up much space on my hanging cookware rack and looks stunning — it’s not much trouble to adjust on the stove or hold while washing in the sink. One thing I do recommend is grabbing Smithey’s handle sleeve with your skillet. It gets hot to the touch quickly and retains it for a long while after cooking.I’ve put this mini pan to good use since it entered my kitchen. I hate cleaning a huge pan whenever I just want an easy, single-serve meal for myself, so I’ve been reaching for the No. 6 even more than all of my other pans. The tiny size, paired with the quality cast iron, means it cooks whatever you throw in it swiftly. Water comes to an even boil inside of it in only two to three minutes; my broccoli cooks through so much faster than I’m used to. Then I use the nifty pouring spouts to drain the excess water!Chicken cooks much quicker with the No. 6 than my other pans, too. It ends up golden and crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside in minutes. I’ve also used it for whipping up scrambled eggs a few times — it can accommodate three eggs, though I recommend working with two for a mess-free stirring experience. The remains wiped off with a little dish soap and my Scrub Daddy sponge, not unlike my pans made of other materials. My favorite use of the No. 6, however, is baking. I made the cutest little vanilla cake in this dish, filling the batter up about halfway and ending up with a fluffy single serving. It’s so much nicer than pulling out my 8-inch cake pan, which always ends up producing way too much dessert that I can’t ever finish on my own. The handle makes it painless to pull it out of the oven. The cake was the hardest to clean out of the interior, but even then, it wasn’t that difficult since I used cooking spray beforehand. I simply put my metal spatula, which also hails from Smithey, to use and the crusted on food came right off.I’m so in love with my mini Smithey that I’m tempted to grab the full-size version. For now, though, the No. 6 is all my kitchen needs. I’m looking forward to watching it get even better over time — and I’m already thinking about getting some engraved and giving them as holiday gifts!",
