You only want to soften the kale slightly, so after about a minute you can use a tong to pick it up, along with the garlic and some of the pasta water.5. Add the kale, garlic, half of the peas, olive oil, basil, mint, juice from half the lemon, a good grating of parmesan (or nutritional yeast) and a little bit of the pasta water (start with 4 tablespoons) to a blender. Mix smooth, taste and adjust the flavor, adding more salt, lemon juice, parmesan or pasta water if needed. You want it entirely smooth but not too runny, in that case you can add some more peas, herbs or cheese.6. Break the florets off the broccoli and toss into the pasta water along with the remaining peas during the last few minutes of the pasta's cooking time.7. Pour it all into a colander and then back into the pot. 8. Pour half of the green sauce into the pot and give it a stir until it's all creamy.9. Grab two plates and divide the remaining sauce in the middle of the plates. Use the backside of a spoon to create round puddles. Divide the pasta on top.10. Chop the toasted hazelnuts and sprinkle over the pasta, along with some fresh mint leaves, a grating of parmesan and lemon zest and freshly ground black pepper.",
