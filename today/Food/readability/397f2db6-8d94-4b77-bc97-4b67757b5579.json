Add in a few hurried mornings and some quick outfit changes between class and dinner with friends, and your closet can feel like an obstacle course of yoga leggings and going-out tops. Ava LeBlanc, a student at Auburn University, wanted a design solution for her stuffed closet that would tidy things up and make getting dressed fun again. “My dorm room closet was packed to the brim,” she says. “I’d been meaning to organize this space for a while.”She decided to add vertical storage, with wall-mounted hooks to keep her accessories in easy view (and off the floor). And because she used Command™ Brand Products, she could increase her closet’s storage space without damaging the walls or needing any tools.First, Ava adhered Command™ Large Utility Hooks to one wall of her closet. Each of these substantial plastic hooks can hold up to five pounds, so they’re perfect for her purse collection. (Don’t forget to wait an hour after adhering before you hang anything on them!)On another wall, Ava used Command™ Decorative Extra-Large Matte Black Triple Hooks to display her hats. These stylish hooks have a three-pronged design that holds up to 10 pounds, so there’s room for her storage needs to grow. And because all Command™ Brand Products remove easily without damaging walls, Ava can switch things up whenever she wants (without making her RA mad).“I’ve always been a believer in the saying, ‘Clean room, clean mind.’ Getting dressed has always been my favorite part of the day, and now I get to enjoy it even more with one less thing to worry about!”Ava LeBlancNow, getting dressed is once again Ava’s favorite part of the day. “This project solved my closet clutter problem and provided me a lot more space and organization,” she says. “It made walking in my closet and finding everything I need so much easier!”",
