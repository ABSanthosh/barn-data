It‚Äôs one of the few combinations that just about everybody, no matter their age, can agree on: Nothing tastes or feels quite as good as frosty, cold ice cream on a hot summer day.But, it‚Äôs the discussion around the best ice cream flavor where opinions tend to differ. Everyone has their favorite, the one go-to that they swear by. For a lot of people, that must-have ice cream flavor is Blue Bell‚Äôs Cookie Cake Ice Cream, which has finally returned to grocery stores, just in time to sweeten up your summer nights.A truly unique and one-of-a-kind creation, Blue Bell‚Äôs Cookie Cake Ice Cream takes everything we already know and love about cookie cakes and turns it into ice cream. The end result? Sweet cream ice cream with lots of chocolate chip cookie cake pieces mixed in with swirls of vanilla and chocolate icing.
