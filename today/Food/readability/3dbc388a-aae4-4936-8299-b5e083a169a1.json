Prior to working at ATM, I earned my degree in Culture Writing and Criticism from NYU, and I interned at publications like CNN Underscored, TV Insider, Texas Monthly (I'm a Dallas native), and more. When I'm not writing, I'm usually at the movies or browsing in a thrift store.published nowWe independently select these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.I’m no stranger to tiny kitchens, but the one in my current studio takes the title of being the smallest I’ve ever dealt with. Last year, in my old apartment that I shared with roommates, I was briefly spoiled with a ton of counter space. So, I decided to finally snag a kitchen essential that I’d been eyeing for years: a KitchenAid stand mixer. I love it as much as I thought I would, using it for cookies, brownies, and even ice cream. I want to get the shaved ice attachment next!But let me once again point out: I now have a kitchen that’s maybe a quarter of the size of my previous one. Even knowing that going in, I brought my trusty KitchenAid along with me. I’ve made it work because I can’t imagine baking without it. Admittedly, my kitchen does get pretty cluttered once I start using my stand mixer, since it takes up a ton of counter space and I have to remove the attachments from the bowl. However, I just found an organizer that solves the second problem, keeping all of your attachments within reach and out of the way. And it’s only $14!What Is the Impresa Stand Mixer Attachment Storage Organizer?Chances are you probably keep your attachments in your stand mixer’s bowl like I do — that is, if you haven’t started collecting more and keeping the overflow in your drawers or cabinets. Regardless, this $14 Amazon solution is a clever alternative. Instead of forcing you to remove the pieces when you want to use your stand mixer, you can keep them stored underneath your kitchen cabinet thanks to this hanging organizer. It takes up no extra space, keeping them accessible at all times and keeping your countertop clear.This find can hold four accessories at once, including the flex edge beater, flat beater, dough hooks, and wire whip. You can install it horizontally as pictured below, but you can also install it vertically on the wall or inside of a cabinet. You can attach it with the included screws, but if you rent, you can adhere it with the included double-sided tape and add a few Command strips for extra security.What Amazon Shoppers Are Saying “Thinner than I expected but gets the job done. I have them up with a sticky strip right now in case I move the mixer to another area. But it also included screws for permanent placement. Holds great and gets the job done without having to store attachments in a drawer.” —Haley Rein “I have fumbled with my KitchenAid attachments for years when I need to use the mixer since I would store them in the bowl. Now that I can leave them hanging up, it has saved wear and tear on them as well as the bowl. Recommend using the small screws that it comes with to hang as the stick strip loses grip if you take the attachments off and on a lot. But it is a game-changer for small kitchens!!” —Nikki Witt “Instead of a drawer full of components, I mounted it inside of a cabinet door. Easy to access and keeps them organized.” —Debbie Nicholls No matter the size of your kitchen, this nifty organizer is a game-changer. It’ll streamline your baking process for under $20 — and that bargain price is probably why over 1,000 shoppers clicked the “buy” button in the past month!
