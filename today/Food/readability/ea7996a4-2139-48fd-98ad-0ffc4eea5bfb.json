I then have the conversation that frozen dinners can be part of a well-rounded meal plan and a major cost-saver, too. The response is usually, “really, I never thought I’d hear you of all people suggest a frozen meal.” Credit: Photo: Wini Lao Photography; Design: The KitchnThen I have to gently clap back and say, having options and access to nourishing meals are equally important. If you skip a meal and then down a package of chips you’re actually not giving your body the vitamins and minerals it wants and needs. At this point, their response is usually, “oh, I never thought of that.” I’m a huge advocate for people being informed consumers. My clinical experience as a Registered Dietitian has taught me that people who can decipher the front as well as the back of a grocery package are more likely to make a choice that supports their current (and future) health. Here’s what I look for when shopping the freezer aisle.Credit: David J Turner/Getty ImagesWhat You Should Consider When Shopping for Freezer MealsI’m partial to ones that supply a good dose of fiber coming from non-starchy vegetables, mainly because current research suggests the average person living in the United States isn’t taking in enough fiber to support digestive health (as well as healthy blood sugar, blood pressure, and heart health). I often also recommend a variety of protein coming from both plant and animal sources, so things like beans and soy as well as seafood and lean meat. Plus, I suggest people pay attention to how much added sugars and added salts they consume. Then, of course, there is price. So many of us make our food choices based on taste and price. If it’s not accessible and affordable, it won’t be eaten. With rising food prices the last thing I want to suggest is something that is out of reach for the average person. There’s no reason to spend $15 on a single frozen meal. In fact, there are plenty of options that are relatively low-cost while being very nutritious. Here are three I recommend stashing in your freezer — they’re all under $7.Credit: Photo: Alex Lepe; Food Styling: Tom Hoerup1. Amy’s Mexican Casserole BowlFrozen casseroles can sometimes get a bad rap, but this one is truly great. If you are like me and like to reheat everything in an oven, Amy’s will take you 15 minutes. If you prefer the microwave, this will be on your plate and ready to enjoy in just six minutes. This is a plant-forward option that is moderate in sodium (16% of daily value) while being high in fiber (21%) and a good source of potassium (8%). Both fiber and potassium are helpful for people thinking about blood pressure balance. It’s flavorful and has a variety of ingredients. Earthy black beans and sweet corn paired with tomatoes, onion, and a generous amount of Monterey Jack cheese come together for a toothsome bite. Want to add even more vegetables to your plate? Pair with a bag of greens and dressing of your choice and you are good to go! Buy: Amy’s Light In Sodium Mexican Casserole Bowl, $5.69 for 9.5 ounces at Amazon Credit: Photo: Alex Lepe; Food Styling: Tom Hoerup2. Healthy Choice Simply Steamers Beef ChimichurriBefore you ask, “Wait, isn’t this diet food for people who are taking a GLP-1?” I’m going to stop you. Yes, it’s marketed that way, which I don’t love mainly because it is a great option for anyone looking for a meal with lean protein and high fiber. It contains simple ingredients — beef, potato, green beans, and bell peppers in a chimichurri — and goes from frozen to ready-to-eat in about five minutes in your microwave. If you want to take it to the stovetop, you’ll need to add extra time and maybe even a bit of water to keep everything moist. Buy: Healthy Choice Simply Steamers Beef Chimichurri, $5.69 for 9 ounces at InstacartCredit: Photo: Alex Lepe; Food Styling: Tom Hoerup3. Saffron Road Chicken Biryani with Basmati RiceI have always loved Indian food — perhaps it’s my Trinidadian grandparents who made a variety of foods with flavors reminiscent of India. Biryani has been a longtime favorite, and Saffron Road has finally made a frozen version that is delicious. Actually I love so many of Saffron Road’s products it was hard to choose just one. This particular biryani is packed with spices like turmeric, ginger, garlic, and onion. It’s gluten-free and certified halal as an added benefit. If you are using a conventional oven it will take you about 30 minutes to reheat the dish and about six minutes in the microwave. You choose. Buy: Saffron Road Chicken Biryani with Basmati Rice, $5.49 for 10 ounces at AmazonWhat frozen dinner do you always have in your freezer?
