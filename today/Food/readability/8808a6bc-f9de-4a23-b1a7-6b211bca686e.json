I do have a book of the month membership – I love it so much. That’s where I got a few books from this month. I get so many of my new releases and debut author books there. You can sign up for one here. Most of these books are linked through bookshop (if available!) and I highly suggest shopping through there because it will support your local indie bookstore. You can choose the local bookstore to support! I support Penguin Books when I buy which is my fave here in Pittsburgh. Okay, keep me posted on what you’re reading below! WHAT I READ IN FEBRUARY 2025 First Time Caller – 5 stars LOVED this one so much! Oh my gosh. This is inspired by sleepless in seattle – need I say more?! We follow Aiden who hosts a love hotline and receives a call from a young girl about her mom. She wants her mom to find love. It is SO cute. Loved the banter, how likeable the characters all were and how the story flowed. It is such a great one if you love a romance! We Could Be Rats – 4 stars This was a book of the month find for me. Oh my gosh – it is so multifaceted. Its quick and you can’t put it down, it’s heartbreaking but also funny at times. In this book we follow the relationship of two sisters – one who is basically the golden child and the other one who is fairly troubled and stuck in the past. Gah. The characters are so likable, I loved them both. This is a pretty short quick read too! The Rules of Fortune – 4 stars I have followed Danielle Prescod forever so I was super excited to read this! I got it as my amazon first reads. If you love books packed with family drama, you will eat this up. We follow a super rich family dealing with the death of their patriarch and tonnnnsss of family secrets are revealed. We jump back in time and learn all about what made the family as they are today. The characters are sooo good in this. Really liked it and it’s a must read. I Might Be In Trouble – 3.5 stars I got this in my book of the month box too! This was a good one – def quirky and funny at times but also quite dark. The story follows a writer who has a one night stand and wakes up to find the date dead. He calls his literary agent and that whole aspect just had me howling because I love my agent dearly and have been with her for a long time. So in that sense in was funny and relatable but it also digs deep into his past. Deep End – 4 stars ahh I have so many thoughts on this book! I love Ali’s books so much – she writes incredible characters who are so smart and realistic. This story follows two collegiate swimmers (one olympian!!) who enter into a BDSM relationship consensually. I don’t love the whole 50 shades of gray aspect and really had no desire to read that, but it ended up being different than I thought. I LOVED the story and the swimming storyline. I sort of thought the main male character was a bit detached. It’s very high spice level. But so good! I couldn’t put it down. Dream Girl Drama – 2.5 stars I was not the hugest fan of this one. I loved the hockey storyline of course, but the main female character drove me crazy at times. The story follows Chloe and Sig who have an intense meeting which is full of major first lust. Only to learn that their parents are engaged to be married. The whole Chloe moves storyline and he pays for everything was a little unrealistic to me. I did like the characters and there was definitely growth at the end, but it still was not my fave. I also saw the twist at the end coming, but it was a nice one.",
