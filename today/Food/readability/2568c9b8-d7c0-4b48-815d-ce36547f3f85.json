Food Stylist: Yossy Arefi.Let’s start with the humble nest cakes. Britain’s favorite Easter dessert, they’re a no-bake medley of chocolate, butter and crunchy cereal, filled with candy, preferably chocolate eggs (they are nests, after all). A mainstay of school bake sales and family get-togethers, they’re one of the first things young British cooks learn to make, and couldn’t be easier: just melt, stir, portion, and then chill until firm. It’s a wonder we even call them cakes at all.The origins of the Easter nest can be traced back to World War II. A recipe for “Chocolate Crisplets” appeared in the 1941 “Mixed Grill of War Time Recipes” booklet, calling for “some unrationed chocolate spread” to be melted and mixed with “enough cereal” until “stiff,” then left to set. The vague instructions — no measurements or specific cereal named — remain typical today.The exact makeup of an Easter nest varies from family to family, and debates continue over the “right” cereal to use — shredded wheat (for the most realistic-looking nest), Rice Krispies (undoubtedly delightful) or cornflakes (my pick) — as well as the addition of golden syrup and butter. But when it comes to decoration, there’s one universally respected rule: Keep it kitsch. The more miniature Easter paraphernalia, from chocolate eggs to tiny plastic chicks, you can pile on, the better.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
