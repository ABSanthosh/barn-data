As a result, I’m not the best at budgeting my time in the mornings. As much as I wish I was the type of person to wake up an extra hour early and get an elaborate breakfast on the table, I can’t find it in myself to wake up sooner than I have to. So, easy “breakfasts” are the name of the game. Mainly, when I do manage to eat something in the mornings, it’s a granola bar, banana, or maybe some toast if I’m not running out of the door.As you can imagine, I don’t even have time for plain old scrambled eggs, let alone something as fancy as quiche. You might be thinking: Can’t you just meal prep it ahead of time, Morgan? In an ideal world, yes. But if we’re being honest here, I still haven’t managed to commit to meal prepping on the regular. I’m a fan of frozen foods that taste like I put hours of effort into them instead, and QVC has a huge lineup of such items that our editors love. (Frozen fried chicken? Check. Philly cheesesteak? You bet.) We just tried the retailer’s delicious quiche in our office, and I’m planning on ordering more to keep at home for my last-minute breakfasts.What Is Oak Stove Kitchens’ Individual Crustless Quiche?Oak Stove Kitchens is a brand based in Georgia, producing handcrafted, gourmet meals that are especially ideal for caterers, cafés, and hotels — in other words, its products include foods that are easy to make and serve, but they still taste amazing. This quiche is no exception. First off, it’s crustless, so you don’t have to deal with the hassle of a pie crust (whether you usually bake it or have to run to the store to buy one). It also means that it’s less heavy than standard quiche. With 16 in a pack, each one is an individual portion with add-ins mixed throughout. The one we tried came with two variations: ham and potato and bell pepper (so if you have some vegetarians in the crowd you’re serving, you’re covered). The former includes smoked ham and Monterey Jack cheese, shredded potatoes, fresh eggs, and rich cream; the latter uses peppers, cheese, and eggs. You can pop them in the oven for about 15 minutes or in the microwave for just a couple, and they’ll be ready to eat!Why I Love Oak Stove Kitchens’ Individual Crustless QuicheLet’s kick things off with how these little quiches ship: They arrive within two days of shipment, packaged with dry ice to keep it fresh. Personally, every time I’ve ordered from QVC, I’ve had zero problems with the shipping and packaging, and the same can be said for the quiche when it arrived at our office. Our commerce executive director, Mark, cooked them from frozen with the Our Place Large Wonder Oven in our kitchen, and our mouths were watering by the time they were done. The custard turned out to be a gorgeous golden brown on the outside and was heated all the way through.  Instead of having to slice into a standard quiche in a dish — which can be a messy affair — we easily grabbed our portions and went to town. (The rest of the office cleared the baking sheets shortly after.) I went for the ham and potato, which I discovered had a stellar creaminess and ratio of add-ins. Echoing our shopping writer Nikol, who tried the one with bell pepper, I recommend eating it with a fork because it did fall apart a bit easily.“It fit in the palm of my hand, so it was a great snack size,” Nikol also says. “I probably could’ve eaten two or three at one time. Unlike a lot of other quiches I’ve had, this one was moist and didn’t taste too doughy. It also wasn’t super structured, but I wasn’t necessarily mad about this — it was still delicious.”Whether you want to keep these stocked for quick breakfasts or serve a crowd for brunch — we have some recommendations for sides to pair with quiche, if so — this find makes it so much easier. You’ll save prep time and cleanup time, and they only end up costing about $5 per portion when you do the math. That’s a deal!My Kitchn HelperGet our favorite editor-tested and -approved finds sent twice a week to your inbox.",
