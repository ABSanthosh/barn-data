I do have a book of the month membership – I love it so much. That’s where I got a few books from this month. I get so many of my new releases and debut author books there. You can sign up for one here. Most of these books are linked through bookshop (if available! some are only on amazon.) and I highly suggest shopping through there because it will support your local indie bookstore. You can choose the local bookstore to support! I support Penguin Books when I buy which is my fave here in Pittsburgh. Okay, keep me posted on what you’re reading below! WHAT I READ IN JANUARY 2025 The Favorites – 5 stars Oh my gosh. I wish I could give this 1o stars. I LOVED THIS. I can’t stop talking (or thinking) about it, and I’m sure it has to do with my figure skating obsession in the 90s. This story follows two very young ice dancers who start skating together at the age of 10 or so. They have a very intense volatile relationship. The writing of these characters is incredible – you love and hate them all. They are endearing but so incredibly flawed. The entire story that I expected to happen, had happened by 25% in. It’s a wild ride and I loved it. Beg Borrow or Steal – 4 stars I loooove this author’s books!! I’ve read the two before this – and while you don’t need to read them in order, it helps with the characters a bit. This story is an enemies-to-lovers trope and so good! We follow Jack and Emilia who are neighbors and enemies but then find themselves having to work together (for a semi-funny reason!). It’s super cute, funny and enjoyable to read! Beautiful Ugly – 4 stars I definitely needed a thriller last month with everything else I read. This was in my book of the month box and it was a good one! This story follows an author who hits the bestsellers list and at the same time, his wife goes missing. There are so many twists in here and lots of fun characters (the dog!). It’s a crazy psychological thriller and I couldn’t put it down! The Path To Loving Him – 3.5 stars This was a cute classic Meghan Quinn book that gets very heated right off the bat! I read this because I’ve read all the other books in the series that follow the family members. They don’t need to be read in order, but it does help if you read them in order just to understand some of the characters. This one follows the oldest brother of the family who is the guardian of his niece. He has a one night stand and then it ends up that this girl is supposed to be working with him. Of course it does! Hahaha. It’s cute and fun and quick. The Life Cycle of the Common Octopus – 3.75 stars I was so inspired to read this after Remarkably Bright Creatures! This one was a little slower and took me a big longer to get into, but ultimately was still good. We follow Penelope who has just gone to college and her parents have divorced. She digs deeper into her past and I loved the family drama \u0026 secrets aspect of it. The Heart of Winter – 4 stars Oh my gosh, this is heartbreaking and lovely and I could not stop reading. I don’t know what drew me in because this is normally something I wouldn’t read – fearing it would be too sad. This story follows a couple who have been together FOREVER and it starts with a diagnosis for one of them. Then it flips back and forth from past and present. It’s about so many little moments and everyday life but how it adds up to a big life/marriage. Definitely left me in tears. Still Standing – 2.75 stars This is where we get into the mind numbing spicy books I read this month. Ha! I blew through a few. This one was interesting… I read it because it followed the story of a motorcycle club (again! Like a few months ago!) and I can’t get over sons of anarchy, ever. While the story was okay, I had SUCH a hard time following the writing of the accents/speaking style of the club members. I would have to read sentences multiple times to understand what they were saying. I understand that is a part of it but this felt so much more intense. Champagne Venom – 3 stars Another one!! This and the below are a series and have to be read in order. Um, I loved these because they follow a russian mafia family… ha! I mean, I loved Sopranos so it reminds me of that. The main (male) character is pretty awful and while you can see some redeeming qualities that will eventually come out, there is SO MUCH back and forth in this book of “will they or won’t they.” I mean, it takes it to a new level. And it’s the same argument and reaction every single time! This ends on a cliffhanger. Champagne Wrath – 3 stars And goes into this book! Which is a continuation of the same family and story. I did like how the family came together in some of this story. There was still a lot of back and forth. I kind of saw what was coming at the end (these are pretty predictable) but it was still such a crazy story to read. Definitely a quick read that I couldn’t put down. The Let Them Theory I am a huuuuuge Mel Robbins fan!! I listened to this last week and love to do these books of audio since the author narrates. I’ve been following Mel for over five years and just adore her. I think she is so down to earth and real. And I also LOVE the premise of this book. Stop wasting your time on things you can’t control. I LOVE IT.",
