The story got us wondering. With inflation rising again in January and the Trump administration’s ongoing threat of tariffs, what might Food and Cooking readers be stocking up on?More than 250 readers responded to our query, many mentioning the same products and expressing at least some anxiety about their long-term availability or cost. Here are the items that came up again and again.CoffeeImageCredit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times“The day after Colombia was threatened with tariffs, I went to Costco and bought 16 pounds of coffee. I call it my strategic coffee reserve. I like looking at it. It makes me feel safe.” — Mary Corbett, San DiegoWhether you believe America runs on Dunkin or oat milk lattes, coffee was the most frequently mentioned item overall. (No surprise there: Consumption in the United States hit a 20-year high in 2024.)

Life has no meaning without maple syrup.” — Geoffrey Wren, Portland, Ore.Despite an 11th-hour deal to delay 25 percent tariffs on Canadian goods, more than 30 respondents said they were still stocking up on maple syrup from our neighbors to the north, which, according to the Maple Syrup Producers association of Quebec, can last for years if unopened, especially if bottled in glass containers. Freezing an opened container of maple syrup can also extend its shelf life.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
