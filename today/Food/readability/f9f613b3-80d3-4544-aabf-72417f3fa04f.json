  "description": "While more rich than our everyday fare, this year needs a Christmas breakfast to top all Christmas breakfasts. We will be making the cinnamon rolls from our Sprouted Kitchen Holidays ebook (gifting half because what better door drop is there). We have made cinnamon rolls the tradition, but everyone is ready for something more substantial after presents. So we’re trying this this year - a bread pudding meets frittata and can be tinkered with all sorts of ways to taste. I’ve now made a mediterranean version with artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes and feta, or a roasted squash and kale take that I made in smaller little ramekins so it felt like a special dinner. If you’re feeding kids? Try getting the vegetables smaller, so they are harder to pick out and the texture sort of blends in.Emmi Gruyere is a great option here because it has a nutty, assertive flavor and also a melty quality to it. Goes so well with mushrooms and the bread makes this a one-dish wonder. We’ve been adding the cheese to the kids grilled cheese sandwiches and into mashed potatoes. Check the store locator for where to find it near you. Thank you for supporting sponsored work on the blog! This post is in partnership with Emmi Roth Cheese, though all words and opinions are my own. Mushroom, Leek and Gruyere StrataServes 6This can take so many different combinations! I left it vegetarian, but some browned breakfast sausage or crispy bacon can be stirred in as well with no other changes should you like. Everything can be assembled the night before and left covered in the fridge overnight. Pull it out first thing in the morning while the oven is preheating and you can enjoy your family instead of working in the kitchen Christmas morning.Gluten Free? We have made this successfully with gluten-free sandwich bread! Ingredients8 oz. fresh bread, cubed (country loaf, French, ciabatta)1 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil1 Tbsp. butter8 oz. mixed mushrooms, stemmed and sliced2 small/1 large leek, white and light green parts, cleaned and sliced4 oz. baby spinach8 eggs1 ½ cup whole milk½ cup cream½ tsp. sea salt1/2 tsp. Fresh ground pepper½ tsp. Dried oregano1 Tbsp. hot sauce1 heaping cup/6 oz. grated Emmi Gruyere, shreddedFresh parsley, for garnishDirectionsPreheat the oven to 375’. Spread the cubed bread on a baking dish and toast for 10 minutes until golden on the edges and dried out. Heat the oil and butter in a large, oven-proof skillet or cast iron pan (about 12”). Add the mushrooms and leeks, a big pinch of salt and pepper and sauté to soften. About 8 minutes. Stir in the baby spinach, turn off the heat, and let it just wilt and cool down. Stir in the toasted bread.While the vegetables cool down, whisk up your egg mixture. In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs, milk, cream, salt, pepper, dried oregano, hot sauce and whisk really well to combine. We want to get some air in there. Stir in the gruyere. Pour the egg mixture over the vegetables, pressing the bread pieces down a bit so they get the custard on all parts. Leave it to soak at room temperature for an hour, or covered, overnight in the refrigerator. Turn the oven down to 350’. Bake on the middle rack for 30 minutes, or until you shake the pan and the center is no longer liquid. A little jiggle is ok, it will set as it cools down. Garnish the top with fresh parsley and serve warm.
