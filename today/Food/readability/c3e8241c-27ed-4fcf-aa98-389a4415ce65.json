This plan to increase the number of locations in the U.S. is part of the company’s five-year national growth strategy, which aims to open nearly 800 stores nationwide by 2028.In 2025, Aldi locations will open in new buildings and select converted Winn-Dixie and Harveys Supermarket locations the brand added to its portfolio when it acquired Southeastern Grocers, the parent company of Winn-Dixie and Harveys.
