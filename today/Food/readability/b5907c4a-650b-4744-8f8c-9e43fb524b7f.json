Hard to believe another year has come and gone, and yet here we are again looking at the yearly roundup of the best recipes published this year! TLDR: this year was the year of kittens and pistachios. We published only 28 recipes this year, even less than last year. Why so few? Well, as in previous years I’ve been focusing more on quality over quantity, testing recipes more times and spending more time writing in-depth, helpful posts with detailed process images (and also a few videos!) But let’s be honest… the real reason(s) there hasn’t been nearly as many new recipes this year? Kittens. Blame the kittens. It’s true, we started fostering kittens through our local animal shelter this summer and have since had 9 kittens (and 1 cat) come through on their way to their forever homes, including a litter of three 10-day old bottle babies (whew boy that’s a lot of work!) and a mama cat and her 5 adorably stripey babies who we named after mushrooms (ahem—Meowshrooms). Be sure to check out my dedicated kitten instagram account @loveandlittlecats for more cuteness, and while we don’t have any kittens at the moment there will definitely be more come spring. **** And with that, let’s bid 2024 adieu and ring in 2025 with delicious wishes for a happy, fulfilling (and just plain filling) New Year!
