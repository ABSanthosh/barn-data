But they won’t find children.In September, the brewery banned people under the age of 16 after what Jay Demagall, an owner, described as multiple incidents in which young children caused potential safety issues.“We had staff trying to serve tables and almost running over 2-year-olds,” he said. “We had kids climbing trees. There were many times I would walk out into the beer garden and see a kid in a tree, and instead of a parent telling them to come down, they’re taking a picture. It was extremely dangerous.”Mr. Demagall is among dozens of brewery owners across the country who have been reconsidering their business’s relationship with children and, in some cases, banning them outright or instituting adults-only hours. These owners cited instances of children throwing rocks or running around unsupervised, staff being forced to act as babysitters, and even one occasion when a parent pulled out a travel potty for a toddler to use in front of other guests.ImagePatrons at Forest City Brewery in Cleveland will find ample space and, often, live music.Credit...Angelo Merendino for The New York TimesImageBut as of September, they won’t find any children under 16 after a handful of safety incidents.Credit...Angelo Merendino for The New York TimesBreweries, often housed in large warehouses or alongside spacious outdoor areas, have earned a reputation as family-friendly destinations, places where parents can enjoy a beer while their children play.
