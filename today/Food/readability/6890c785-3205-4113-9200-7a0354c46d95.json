Prior to working at ATM, I earned my degree in Culture Writing and Criticism from NYU, and I interned at publications like CNN Underscored, TV Insider, Texas Monthly (I'm a Dallas native), and more. When I'm not writing, I'm usually at the movies or browsing in a thrift store.published nowWe independently select these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Given how often I eat them, I consider myself a bit of a cookie aficionado. They’re my go-to sweet treat whenever the dessert mood strikes me — which is often — and there are some truly stellar bakeries based here in New York City. So, whenever I’m out and about and I pass a Levain Bakery (which I can confirm is definitely worth waiting in line for) or a Chip City? There’s a good chance I’ll stop in. At this point, I think I’ve tasted some of the best cookies New York has to offer.So, a few years ago, when I stumbled across this TikTok video where the creator tries the “most expensive cookies money can buy,” I was intrigued. Not enough that I could convince myself to fork over over $100 for a set, but I found myself wondering, could they really be worth it? Last Crumb definitely acts the part of a luxury brand, dropping limited edition batches every so often online and sending its cookies in exclusive, ultra-fancy packaging. At long last, we finally got our hands on some of the splurgiest cookies around, and naturally, we had so many thoughts.What Is Last Crumb’s Core Cookie Collection?What exactly makes Last Crumb and its Core Collection so special? The Los Angeles-based company came about in 2021, and it started going viral fairly early on. There’s really no question as to why: Last Crumb’s hefty price raised a good amount of eyebrows (just check out the comments on TikTok). The whole Last Crumb experience is more high-end than you’d probably expect for a cookie.First, the brand bakes small batches of the Core Collection weekly. Twelve handmade and freshly baked cookies are included in each package, and the flavors are selected by the (unnamed and mysterious) Head Baker. Each one is designed to “evoke past memories or make the present sweet enough to remember.” They change every so often — since its inception, Last Crumb has put out 84 flavors — and each cookie bag notes the flavor number, collection number, total flavors, and year released. (A serial number, if you will.)Our package featured the brand’s number one cookie, “Better than Sex,” which is your classic chocolate chip. The rest had similarly fun names: “Everything but the Candles” (birthday cake), “The Madonna” (peanut butter), “When Life Gives You Lemons” (lemon bar), “The Floor Is Lava” (chocolate lava), “Macadamnia” (salted caramel macadamia), “The James Dean” (Oreo milkshake), “What the Velvet” (red velvet), “Not Today Mr. Muffin Man” (blueberry muffin), “Netflix and Crunch” (cinnamon toast crunch), “S’mores Sans Campfire” (s’mores), and “Donkey Kong” (Banana Cream Pie).What We Thought of Last Crumb’s Core Cookie CollectionFirst things first: I have to say, we were all wowed by the cookies’ packaging, as expected. This is a package that’s meant to be seen and showed off in an unboxing video. After dutifully following the instructions written on the outside — “open the damn box” — we discovered that each cookie gets its own slot and individual bag, which is useful if you don’t want to scarf them down all at once. (Which is pretty much impossible on your own, but more on that later.)Then, we popped them in the microwave. The included guidebook told us 15 seconds, but we gave them all about 30 seconds of heat-up time. Looking at them, we could tell that these weren’t your average cookies — which is reassuring considering the price tag attached to them. These are more like tiny cakes than cookies in terms of thickness. The brand advises cutting each cookie in fourths and sharing them — so if you’re keeping these to yourself, you’ll be stocked for a long, long while.In our attempt to try them all, there were still leftovers between our group of six. Our consensus is that these babies are as sugary and rich as they look, so don’t go into it expecting to eat a ton of them. (To me, that feature counted against them — I want to be able to finish my cookie, but I could barely eat the small pieces I took of each flavor!) As Mara, our senior groceries editor, put it: “In general, the cookies tasted too sweet to me (and I have a serious sweet tooth).” She especially enjoyed the bright lemon flavor and its slightly doughy, underbaked quality — but it “just needed a tad (or a few tablespoons) less sugar.”Along with lemon — which our commerce director Mark said “didn’t taste artificial” like most lemon cookies he’s tried — a few standouts for us were the chocolate lava, blueberry muffin (my top choice), and Funfetti-esque birthday cake flavors. In fact, after we heated up the lava cookie for a bit too long, our social media manager, Andrea, said that “the chocolate lava cookie was worth burning [her] tongue on.” The rest of us agreed, with Mara adding that “the chocolate molten interior isn’t something [she’s] seen in a store-bought (or shipped) cookie. It really does mimic the flavor in the iconic dessert.”We had a few differing opinions on our favorites (and least favorites), of course. Nikol, our commerce shopping writer, found that the more complex flavors she expected to enjoy the most — like s’mores and lava — missed the mark for her. “I’d rather just eat an actual lava cake or blueberry muffin than a cookie version of it,” she noted. “I was surprised to find that I enjoyed the more basic flavors the most. The chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies were my favorite. They were soft, thick, and sweet, and they weren’t trying to do too much. The classics reigned supreme for me.”Some certainly veered more into cake territory, which may or may not appeal to you. Without a doubt, these cookies are definitely unique, at least compared with all of the others I’ve tried. Like its special packaging and limited edition drops suggest, they’re an experience. Last Crumb gives you the option to order a six-, 12-, or 24- of the single flavor you think you’ll like the most, but I recommend grabbing a group of friends or family and doing a taste test of all 12 flavors. It makes for a great party activity, or even a splurgy gift for the foodie in your life.Buy: The Core Collection, $120My Kitchn HelperGet our favorite editor-tested and -approved finds sent twice a week to your inbox.",
