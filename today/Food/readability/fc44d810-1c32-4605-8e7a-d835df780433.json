Or maybe it’s because the U.K. actually leads the world in gin exports, sending some of their best work all around the globe for us to enjoy—and we like to think that there's no better time than during the holidays. Juniper berry (which, plot twist, isn’t a berry at all but a female seed cone) gives it a pine-y flavor. And while gin isn’t exactly new to the region (remember the Gin Craze of circa 1720?) the craft gin scene in Britain has exploded over the last decade, and as a result, London now has more distilleries now than the entirety of the U.K. did in 2010. Which for us, means even more delicious ways to drink it. From versions with wild marsh samphire and hand-picked gorse flowers (looking at you, Conker Distillery), and even rose petal and Earl Grey-infusions, there’s truly never been a better time to be a gin fan. And while you could mix gin with tonic or cranberry juice, we’ve found festive ways to mix it into cocktails—and even a dessert!—that feel celebratory and seasonal. We’ll cheers to that. 1. Figgin’ Delicious Figs? In a (Hayman’s) London-Dry gin cocktail? It’s festivities in a glass. By muddling the figs with some maple syrup and balancing it out with tart lime and spicy ginger beer, this combo is sure to be a hit. Don’t let the double-strain technique throw you off—this drink is pretty simple to pull together and massively worth it. 2. Lemon Lavender Gin Rickey Everyone could use a little more relaxation during the holidays, and this Lavender Gin Rickey is just the aromatic ticket. We like using a citrusy gin such as Cotswold Dry Gin to fully compliment this classic cocktail. Yes, it’s 100 years old, but it’s anything but tired—it’s tried, tested, and true. And you can keep the holiday spirit alive by switching up the citrus from the typical lime or adding some herbs like rosemary to keep it fresh. 3. Aviation Another New York wonder, this classic gin cocktail comes highly recommended by Erik Lombardo, the general manager of Bad Roman in New York City. The luxurious addition of crème de violette paired with gin (we love Caorunn Scottish Gin for this), lemon juice, and the liqueur maraschino give this straight-up libation an elegant air thanks to that lavender color. Serve it with a maraschino cherry, and you’re set. 4. Ramos Gin Fizz Taken from the pages of New Orleans Cocktails: Over 100 Drinks from the Sultry Streets and Balconies of the Big Easy by drink innovator Sarah Baird, this classy, creamy cocktail has it all: gin (a good choice for this tipple is Warner's Blossom), half and half, simple syrup, lemon and lime juice, orange blossom water, and egg white. Give it a good, hard shake to achieve that frothy consistency that these ingredients beg for. Bonus: Negroni Jello Shots We just had to include at least one gin-fueled dessert—and nothing says holiday party like a boozy jello mold. Infused with Campari, sweet vermouth, and of course, London Dry gin, this Negroni-inspired creation is sure to be a hit with your guests. And don’t be scared to try making from other classic cocktails, too—vesper martini jello, anyone? If you try it, let us know. We want to know: Do you think of gin when it comes to the holidays?",
