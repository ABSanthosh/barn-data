You can find more of my picks here, as well as my amazon store front. My kids’ birthdays are in the late fall too, so I’ve already started making some gift guides since I’ve bought some birthday and christmas gifts for them! What are you loving?! Top 15 Amazon Prime Day Favorites Tineco iFloor 3. I’ve mentioned this a few times but it changed my life. I mean, not to be dramatic. It changed my cleaning life! This cleans my floors like NOTHING else. It is incredibly satisfying and cleans so well. There are some weeks when I use it daily! Parchment Paper Sheets. I buy these over and over again. Can’t live in my kitchen without them! All Clad Immersion blender. It’s soup season! I have not always loved the immersion blender but this one changed my mind. It works SO fast and it’s easy to use. It doesn’t spray everywhere. It’s super smooth makes blending in a pot simple. Amazon Smart Plugs. I use these every holiday season and adore them. All of our christmas tree lights hook up to these, as well as any lit garland in the house. With one command, all the holiday lights come on! So easy. Breville Barista Touch. During prime day this past summer, I made an impulse purchase and oh my, was it wonderful. I love this and so does everyone who steps foot in my house! It’s like having a little coffee shop in your home. The coffee is incredible. LEVOIT Air Purifiers. I bought these last year when we moved into our house, mostly because there was still some work happening. I have a few around the house (our room, upstairs, basement, etc) and am so happy with them. KitchenAid cordless hand mixer. Going cordless on this changed my life. It is SO much easier to use in the kitchen and especially with kids. Le Creuset Dutch Oven. I use my dutch oven multiple times a week – for so many different dishes. Even for bread. It’s a must have and this quality is unmatched. Apple AirPods Max. I didn’t expect to like these, but I have ended up LOVING them. They are the most comfortable noise cancelling headphones I’ve ever used. They are wonderful!! Breville the Smart Oven® Air Fryer Pro. This is one of my favorite kitchen appliances. I love having it in my kitchen to easily reheat items or make things like quick chicken fingers for the kids. Definitely my favorite air fryer too! wernies No Show Socks. Best socks ever! They do not slip at all. I have repurchased these many many times. Nanit Pro Smart Baby Monitor. I got this in 2021 when I had Jordan and it was one of the best purchases. I love it. I travel with it and still use it every night. Wall Charger, Surge Protector. I have a few of these and I like to travel with them. They are also great in the kitchen. We all have so many different devices these days that having this is necessary. Beckham Hotel Collection Bed Pillows. A few years ago I was googling the best pillows. I’ve done this many times and we’ve never been satisfied. But 3 or 4 years ago we got these (and have since replaced once or twice!) and they are INCREDIBLE. We both love them. We have the king version. Clean skin club facial towels. I’ve been using these for over a year every night and I swear they’ve changed my skin. I was going through so many towels to ensure I always had a clean one for my face, and with little kids and hand washing, it was hard to determine that. I LOVE these – they are so convenient and easy to use. Kindle Paperwhite. I had to include this bonus because I can’t live without my kindle these days. Max also has one and uses it constantly when we’re on the go. I take mine everywhere. I actually get anxious if I forget it at home!
