Don’t get me wrong, I love a cozy fall or winter drink (and I’ll definitely make the case for them come September), but in the warmer months, it’s time to swap the apple, ginger, and whiskey for strawberry, rose, and Aperol. If you’ve read my previous deep dives into flips or tea-infused syrups, you already know I love writing (and thinking) about cocktails. I’m always on the lookout for ways to zhuzh up the classics—whether it’s a spritz or a gin and tonic. Is it in the syrup? The liqueur? A splash of something floral or fizzy? Yes to all of the above. In the Food52 test kitchen and office, we’re constantly asking each other: What’s the drink of the summer? Aperol spritzes and limoncello cocktails are always contenders. But this year, I’ve also seen a strong case for the Campari spritz and the Americano. (Basically, we’re all in our red bitter era.) As part of my job, I talk to a lot of cocktail people—bartenders, beverage directors, winemakers. I sit next to them at dinners and talk about the state of liquor sales, I go to tastings a few times a week, and I filter through thousands of recipes. So this summer, I rounded up some of the most creative and exciting cocktails I’ve tried lately—about 17 of them, from restaurants, bartenders, and yes, even brands. But hear me out on that last one—many of the branded recipes come straight from pros, and even if you don’t use the exact liquor they suggest, the ingredients and ideas are still worth exploring. What Makes a Great Summer Cocktail? It’s pretty simple: It should be refreshing, chilled, and ideally not as strong as a dirty martini. I’m loving anything with cucumber, mint, and berries—bonus points if there’s muddling involved and it ends with a fizzy topper like soda water or prosecco. The best summer cocktails feel a little loose and playful. If you’re improvising, start with: • Any fresh fruit or citrus • A light-colored spirit (vodka, gin, pisco, etc.) • An herbal or floral component • Something bubbly (sparkling wine, soda water, tonic) It doesn’t have to be complicated—it just has to be cold. Summer Bar Cart Essentials These recipes pull from all over, but if you want to be ready for anything, here’s what I’d recommend stocking: • Gin: Plymouth (for versatility), Hendrick’s (for floral vibes), Four Pillars (fun flavors, especially their Yuzu), Empress (for color), and Drumshanbo Gunpowder (if you want to go Irish). • Vodka: I’m no vodka expert, but American Harvest surprised me in a recent tasting—definitely reaching for that over Tito’s now. (I also included a fun martini recipe using it below.) • Aperol, Campari, and Limoncello: If it’s bitter and citrusy, I’m in. • Sparkling wine: Prosecco, Champagne, or even a good sparkling rosé. For a nonalcoholic option, Libby NA sparkling wine is testing-approved and found at Trader Joe’s. 1. Blackberry Basil Sour Rye, blackberries, and basil come together in a berry-forward cocktail with depth. 2. Live Laugh Lychee If you haven’t had a lychee cocktail yet, this bright, floral drink is your sign to start. 3. Sweet Cucumber Created by Andrei Cocom, Bar supervisor atCanopy by Hilton Cancun La Isla, this drink feel like spa water with a kick. 4. The Limoncello Spritz This limoncello-forward stunner comes from Lauren Kyle McDavid and her new bar, Bar Trove. It uses Lillet and pisco—bright, unexpected, and summer-ready. 5. Moonlight Margarita From Solento Organic tequila, this cocktail is a moody, nighttime take on the marg that’s still refreshing and citrus-packed. 6. Slow Sun Martini Smooth and stylish—like golden hour in a glass from the team at Solento Organic Tequila. 7. Espolon 'Pitaya Margarita' Dragon fruit juice adds vibrant color and subtle sweetness to this simple marg. 8. Tropical Coconut Margarita Coconut + lime = beachy perfection. Serve this one by a pool if you can. 9. Hibiscus Negroni A floral twist on a classic, courtesy of the Travelle at The Langham, Chicago. 10. Marcel’s Garden A green, herbal-forward cocktail that feels like sipping through a lush backyard. 11. Peach Blossom Spritz Peach, Casamigos, and pretty vibes only. This one’s begging for golden hour. 12. Spicy Cucumber Margarita Jalapeño + cucumber = the refreshing kick you didn’t know you needed. 12. The Frozen Hour One of my favorites from the mixologists at Travelle. Chill this one hard—it’s got pear liqueur, ice wine, and serious summer martini energy. 13. Lavender Lemon Drop Martini Only three ingredients, but packs a citrusy, floral punch—easy and elegant. I recently tried American Harvest in some different martinis and highly recommend grabbing a bottle. 14. Knob Creek Red All Over A bourbon drink that still feels light and sippable thanks to fresh strawberry, basil, and lemon. 15. Yuzu Spritz From Four Pillars and their fan-favorite yuzu gin—zingy and super summery. 16. Midsummer Solstice Chartreuse, St. Germain, and Italicus make this one a floral dream—straight from the Ritz-Carlton St. Louis. 17. Wilde ‘75 A rosy twist on one of my all-time favorite cocktails. Light, bubbly, and super customizable—try adding a splash of elderflower liqueur or garnish with any citrus or herb you have on hand. Want to build your own? What are you shaking up this summer?",
