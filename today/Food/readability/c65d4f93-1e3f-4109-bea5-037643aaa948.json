All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Pamela Brick/ShutterstockTo make my mornings quick and easy, I usually prepare a few jars of overnight oats at the beginning of the week. This creamy, satisfying breakfast is highly customizable, so sometimes I add fresh blueberries, toasted coconut, or a scoop of my favorite jam. If you’ve made overnight oats before, you know the importance of storing them in the right container — otherwise, they can dry out.Lately, I’ve been seeing tons of clips on social media of creators showcasing the cutest vintage-looking “overnight oat containers” from Target. Usually, I try to ignore these kinds of videos to avoid getting swayed by everything I see online, but these bowls were so gorgeous that a few days later, I found myself driving to my local store to pick up a few sets.Target’s viral overnight oat bowls feature ribbed glass, a popular trend from the early 20th century, during the Art Deco and mid-century modern design movements. They have a wooden lid and a gold spoon. They come in three colors: clear, red, and green. The best part? They’re available in the Dollar Spot section for only $5 each. One Instagram creator, @target_junkie, posted about this overnight oats container, and people on social media could not stop raving about it. One person commented, “So pretty. I’ll have to check my Target for these,” while another user called out, “Am I the only one who immediately thought this is the perfect fancy cereal bowl? I need one of each color immediately!”Target also sells an acai bowl made of ribbed glass, complete with a wooden lid and gold spoon, all for just $5. This find has generated a lot of hype on social media, with people unable to stop raving about it.Unfortunately, Target’s overnight oats and acai containers aren’t available online. However, you can find plenty of similar options on the store’s website. For example, you can grab a tinted green glass container with a wooden lid from the Magnolia brand for $5 each. These jars are perfect for storing overnight oats, thick smoothies, or acai bowls.",
