No, this isn’t just a summer fever dream. Bourbon’s sweet, warm, slightly smoky profile pairs beautifully with all kinds of cooking techniques—grilling included.

And while we’re all for a bourbon on the rocks while the coals heat up, there’s another reason to keep that bottle close: It might just be the secret ingredient your summer cooking’s been missing. No, this isn’t just a summer fever dream. Bourbon’s sweet, warm, slightly smoky profile pairs beautifully with all kinds of cooking techniques—grilling included. But it’s just as impactful in a stovetop glaze, a hot skillet, or even a rich dessert. From smoky grilled chicken to syrupy French toast with heat, these bourbon-spiked dishes come straight from the chefs who actually cook with it. Grilling With Bourbon Isn’t New—But It’s Worth Repeating Cooking with bourbon isn’t a trend; it’s a time-tested trick chefs and home cooks have been using to deepen flavor for decades. From a quick splash in a marinade to a rich glaze lacquered over charred meat, it adds warmth, sweetness, and complexity that’s hard to beat. We’ve seen it all over our archives—salmon slicked in bourbon teriyaki, double-char steaks, even a bacon-studded apple crisp. And this summer, a few top chefs confirmed we’re not alone. The Chef-Approved Secret to Big Flavor “Bourbon in the kitchen isn't just there to get you tipsy,” says Chef Dafne Mejia, runner-up from Hell’s Kitchen Season 21. “It’s the secret my family uses for that magic flavor. It unlocks a deep, complex sweetness and warmth that elevates the entire dish.” This summer, she’s reaching for Off Hours Bourbon for its rich caramel and vanilla notes, with just a bit of spice. Her Torrejas Hondureñas recipe uses it to bring a toasty richness to a savory French toast-like base, and it’s just one example of how versatile a pour of bourbon can be. “Bourbon adds sophisticated layers of flavor that are not easily achieved by other ingredients,” she adds. “It’s like giving your dish a warm hug from abuelita with a side of boujee.” Brine It, Brush It, Glaze It Chef Jamie Lynch of Church \u0026 Union (and Top Chef alum) is another bourbon believer. His Whiskey-Brined Duck calls for a four-hour soak in bourbon, thyme, and a handful of salt and peppercorns before searing. The result? Deep, juicy, and unforgettable. The brine helps tenderize the meat and infuse it with flavor that pairs beautifully with the duck’s richness. From Bourbon to Barbecue: Recipes Worth Firing Up the Grill For We also turned to the legendary grill master himself, Steven Raichlen, for expert guidance. Partnering with Bib \u0026 Tucker Whiskey this summer, Raichlen reminds us that bourbon and beef are an American classic for a reason. “Since the earliest days of our nation, beef and bourbon have been keeping one another fine company,” he says. “There’s something about the sweetness of sipping whiskey that enhances the rich, meaty flavor of beef. Whether you're going all out with a tomahawk or sticking to skirt steak, a bourbon-soy marinade takes it to a whole new level.” Check out some of his best recipes, including a killer Bacon Bourbon Apple Crisp. 1. Torrejas Hondureñas by Chef Dafne Mejia A richer take on French toast, soaked in bourbon-spiked syrup. The bread gets a double dip—first in a cinnamon-bourbon batter, then in a custard—before hitting the pan. 2. Bourbon Brine Duck by Chef Jamie Lynch Duck breast brined in thyme, bourbon, and peppercorns. Chef Jamie Lynch walks you through making the perfect brine, getting a good sear, and making the most of your meat. 3. Double Char Steak with Bourbon Marinade The kind of recipe that'll make you want to splurge on your next cut of steak (and bottle of whiskey). The marinade is simple and foolproof, but deepened with the addition of bourbon and sesame oil. 4. Smoked Grilled Chicken With Bourbon Peach Glaze You can never go wrong with grilled chicken, but especially not with this one. Bourbon and and peaches are a perfect match in this glaze that'll want to put on everything this summer. 5. Bourbon Teriyaki Salmon Is there anything better than teriyaki and salmon? The flavors blend so well with an added splash of bourbon to deepen the flavor. 6. Bacon Bourbon Apple Crisp Wow your BBQ guests with this bacon-bourbon take on apple crisp. A great excuse to get out the cast-iron and peel some apples. 7. Grilled mint peach juleps 8. Sugar Steak with Bourbon 9. Grilled Grits with Shrimp and Bourbon Coffee Glaze 10. Whole grilled chicken with bourbon BBQ sauce 11. Orange \u0026 Molasses Grilled Pork Chops How are you cooking with bourbon this summer? Any go-to recipes you're loving?",
