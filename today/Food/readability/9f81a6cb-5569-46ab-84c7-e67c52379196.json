All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Stefania Pelfini, La Waziya Photography / Getty ImagesPersonally, I’ve never been a fan of water filters. My dad gets onto me for drinking tap water and, up until about three months ago, he was dedicated to a leading brand, switching out the filters on the dot every couple of months. I know a lot of people, including my roommate, who swear by same filter; it’s one of the most popular for countertop pitchers. But once you look at all of the other options available, you realize it’s not necessarily the end-all, be-all.When my dad finally decided to retire his decade-old pitcher — mainly because he doesn’t like the concept of drinking out of plastic anymore and also because said plastic tends to inevitably grow pink mold — he switched to Aarke. The brand’s Purifier instantly caught my eye with its sleek design the last time I visited my parents. After trying it out myself, I think this is the one pitcher that can convince me to stop my lifelong tap water consumption habit.What is the Aarke Purifier?Unlike plastic water filter pitchers, Aarke’s purifier is made of glass and stainless steel. The only plastic it has is food-grade, BPA-free thermoplastic, which acts as a suction stopper around the lid to prevent leakage when pouring. The pitcher also features food-grade silicone at its base, which helps prevent it from sliding on your counter. The glass body naturally makes this product a little heavier than your average plastic pitcher, but it also adds durability and contributes to a modern, upscale look you don’t get from cheaper alternatives.On the inside, the purifier has a stainless steel compartment into which you pour your water. From there, the water trickles down through a smaller stainless steel cartridge, which is where it gets purified. Instead of using a traditional plastic filter, the Aarke purifier uses filter granules to remove impurities from the water. After it’s been filtered, the water fills up the glass body of the pitcher and is ready to drink.My parents own the 7-cup purifier, but it’s currently not in stock on Aarke’s website. You can still buy the 5-cup version, though, which comes with one bag of filter granules. There are also bundles available on the same product page with additional filter granule bags and with Enriched granule bags, which alkalinize the water. Why My Parents Love the Aarke PurifierAside from the fact that the Aarke Purifier looks so luxe sitting atop my parents’ counter, my dad loves how easy it is to change the filter granules. The interior stainless steel compartments come out easily, so once you’ve opened a granule bag, you can just pour it right into the cartridge and reinsert it. Additionally, each bag of granules lasts two months, and although you can buy replacements directly from Aarke’s website, my dad just buys them on Amazon. A set of three bags lasts six months, which is pretty good for $25. The pitcher’s lid conveniently has a calendar dial on its underside, so you can set it to the month when you inserted new granules. This way, you’ll know when two months have passed and that it’s time to pour in new granules. “I love small but useful details like this,” my dad said. “Every aspect of the pitcher is so well-designed.”As I already mentioned, my parents own the 7-cup pitcher, which is already pretty small at 10 inches tall and a little over 5 inches wide. The one downside to its compact size is that you have to refill it often, especially if more than one person uses it. The 5-cup pitcher will probably have to be refilled after every pour if you’re filling a large water bottle. But if you live on your own and have a tiny kitchen, I’m certain you’ll appreciate its small footprint, especially if you like to store your pitcher in the fridge. My parents’ old pitcher was so large and bulky, so the smaller one from Aarke is definitely an upgrade in that regard. In any case, it filters the water quickly, so you don’t have to wait a long time to use the pitcher between refills.Finally, I love that the water filtered through the Aarke pitcher tastes good. I’ve drank from some filters at friends’ houses that made the water taste weird; truth be told, it’s why I’d always preferred plain old tap water  — until I tried Aarke. Plus, there’s none of that icky pink mold! Although the purifier is relatively pricey at over $100, I think it’s well worth the cost for clean, great-tasting water and a design that won’t be an eyesore on your counter.Buy: Purifier, 5 Cups, $130My Kitchn HelperGet our favorite editor-tested and -approved finds sent twice a week to your inbox.",
