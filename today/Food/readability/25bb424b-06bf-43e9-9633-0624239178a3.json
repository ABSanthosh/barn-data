From Ina Garten’s lemon roasted chicken to Maialino’s olive oil cake, these are the dishes you bookmarked, remade, and raved about all year long. Time and again, these standouts have reigned supreme, and this year was no exception. Alongside the usual favorites, homemade sauces, hearty soups, and show-stopping desserts also made their mark. If you haven’t tried these recipes yet, consider this your sign. As we head into 2025, we’re excited to bring you even more Test Kitchen-approved recipes, and we can’t wait to have you cook along. 1. Ina Garten’s Cauliflower Toasts From Ina Garten’s Cook Like a Pro, this recipe proves she can make even cauliflower irresistible. Broil it until golden, toast some country-style bread, and top with Gruyère, prosciutto, and a hint of nutmeg. 2. One-Pot Butternut Squash Mac \u0026 Cheese Upgrade your classic mac \u0026 cheese with roasted butternut squash, lots of white cheddar, and a sprinkle of fresh herbs. It’s creamy, comforting, and ready in under 30 minutes—all in one pot. No wonder it’s a fan favorite. 3. Spinach Tortellini Soup by Joanna Gaines Joanna Gaines delivers cozy in a bowl with this hearty, one-pot dinner. Fire-roasted tomatoes, basil, and tender tortellini come together in just 30 minutes. Don’t forget the extra shaved Parmesan on top. 4. Maialino’s Olive Oil Cake This iconic cake might be one of our most popular dessert recipes ever. It’s rich, moist, and essentially a blank canvas for any toppings you want—whipped cream, berries, or a dusting of powdered sugar. 5. Double Chocolate Weed Brownies These brownies are next-level fudgy, loaded with semi-sweet chocolate chips, and, if you so choose, a little something extra. Even without the infusion, this is hands down one of the best brownie recipes out there. 6. Oven Roasted Corn on the Cob With Husks This is one of the easiest and best ways to make corn on the cob. Plus, there’s no cleaning or peeling involved. Simply toss it on the oven rack, roast, and enjoy. It’s no surprise this recipe is so popular. 7. Homemade A1 Steak Sauce We might go so far to say that this homemade sauce is better than the bottled stuff. It’s made with pantry staples you probably already have and comes together quickly. It’s great to keep in the fridge for whenever you want to elevate the protein on your plate. 8. Pasta with Garlic Butter Sauce It doesn’t get much easier than garlic butter noodles, which is why this recipe is so beloved. It’s simple, only requires four ingredients, and is better than your average buttered noodle. Top with cracked pepper, fresh herbs, and extra Parmesan for a no-fail weeknight dinner. 9. Olive Oil \u0026 Maple Granola Once you try this granola, you’ll never go back to store-bought. Swap in your favorite nuts, seeds, or dried fruit—and don’t skimp on the cinnamon and cardamom. 10. Classic Nigerian Jollof Rice Since 2016, this vibrant, tomato-based rice has continually topped our most-popular list. The combination of spicy peppers and curry powder also give it a wonderful smoky flavor. 11. Brown Sugar and Balsamic Glazed Pork Tenderloin This slow-cooker recipe is a no-stress dream—minimal dishes, no stove time, just melt-in-your-mouth pork. Even if you don’t have a slow cooker, the marinade (brown sugar, balsamic, and soy sauce) is good enough to use on everything. 12. Bill Smith’s Atlantic Beach Pie This genius pie is perfect for anyone who’s intimidated by traditional crusts. The salty-sweet base is simply made from saltine crackers, butter, and sugar, and the creamy filling is just as simple. 13. Marcella Hazan’s Tomato Sauce Marcella Hazan’s tomato butter sauce is legendary for a reason. Made with just a few high-quality ingredients (Italian tomatoes are a must), it’s silky, rich, and endlessly satisfying. 14. Momofuku’s Soy Sauce Eggs These are the kind of eggs that go beyond breakfast. Simmered in soy sauce and sherry vinegar, they’re savory, tangy, and umami-packed. 15. Cardamom Cake From Niloufer Ichaporia King The magic of this cake lies in its simplicity: cardamom, butter, sugar, and flour. The hardest part? Prepping the pan. From there, it’s smooth sailing to a buttery, fragrant dessert that will leave your kitchen smelling amazing. 16. Vegetable Beef Soup Every fall and winter, we’re reminded why this soup is the absolute best. It’s loaded with tender beef, potatoes, and lots of veggies—always welcome on a cold night. 17. Magical Coffee What makes this coffee so magical is that it’s only four ingredients (one of which is water). It’s a great low-effort cold brew. Simply combine the ingredients, let them steep overnight, and wake up to the perfect cup of coffee. 18. Ina Garten's Skillet-Roasted Lemon Chicken When in doubt, roast a chicken, specifically Ina Garten's lemon chicken. It does require chopping an onion and slicing some lemons, but other than that, the oven does most of the work. How easy is that? 19. Peach Tart This peach tart is just as stunning as it is simple. Like so many of the recipes on this list, the ingredient list is short and consists of things you probably already have on hand. It also makes the most of summer produce. 20. Cinnamon Scone Bread A staple since Mrs. Larkin first brought this to our test kitchen in 2014. It’s a delicious hybrid of monkey bread, pull-apart bread, and scones. The layering takes some time, but the fluffy, cinnamon-spiced result is worth it. 21. Torta Caprese This cake gives you the perfect opportunity to break out your kitchen scale, since everything is in grams. However, with equal parts of each ingredient, it’s practically foolproof. It’s also worthy of that special dark chocolate bar you’ve been saving. 22. Burmese Braised Chicken This bright, warming dish is inspired by Burmese coconut chicken curry. Lime, ginger, and sweet potatoes make it comforting, yet full of vibrant flavor. 23. Jiffy “Corn Casserole” It’s the original Jiffy Corn Casserole recipe that we know and love—creamy, comforting, and ridiculously easy to whip up. It’s a classic for the holidays, or anytime you want a no-fail side dish. 24. The Best Sausage Stuffing It doesn’t have to be Thanksgiving to make this stuffing. Packed with sausage, herbs, and plenty of bread (the best part), it’s the kind of dish you’ll want to eat straight from the pan. We want to know: What recipe did you make the most this year?",
