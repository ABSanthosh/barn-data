  "text": "A peek at everything I loved in May 2025! FOOD Go raw snacking granola. My favorite granola is still the cookie granola, but this comes in as a close second. It is SO good! Super crunchy, tastes amazing. The kids love it too. San pellegrino CIAO sparkling waters. I think I’ve mentioned different sparkling waters every month recently, but we are all loving these ones. They are san pellegrinos version of spindrift and so delish. Johnnypops rainbow popsicles. My kids adore these! They are so refreshing. We are fans of every flavor. HOME Dock and Bay beach towel. My favorite quick drying towel that I take EVERYWHERE. It folds up so small and can go in any bag for the kids. Wood serving bowl board. Got this a few weeks ago and used it all weekend for hosting. It’s so nice. Clipa bag hanger. Many times, I forget about my favorite bag hanger! But this is a must if you have a top-handle bag that doesn’t have a strap – it’s perfect for hanging the bag right next to you so you don’t have to put it on the floor. Hulken bag. End of the school year when I remind you just HOW MUCH I love this freaking bag. It does everything and is also great for travel. I got them for the end of year teacher gifts this year again. Huge hits!! Costco apparently has a dupe, but I haven’t tried it yet. BEAUTY Laniege lip glaze in strawberry sprinkle. Another month, another mention of this. It’s my go-to right now. I have one at home, my car, in my bag, etc. Byoma nourishing body oil. Basically I want to say Byoma everything! Prequel moisturizing milk. This lotion is SO smoothing. I wouldn’t suggest using it right after shaving (def burned my legs!) but otherwise it’s incredible. And so light but moisturizing at the same time. JVN Blowout styling milk. More milk… ha. This is for hair and it’s super lightweight – I use it on both my own hair and Emilia’s. I take a small amount and work it through when damp before blow drying. It doesn’t weigh hair down at all. FASHION Wide leg palazzo pants. Obsessed with these pants with a tank top or tee. They are so comfortable, flattering and not too long! Being only 5″1′ that is key. If you’re tall they might be too short, just FYI. Crochet tank tops. Super cute for the season – I got one in black and pink! Tie dye summer maxi dress. I’ve found a lot of easy casual dresses on amazon this month that I love, and this is my fave. I live in dresses in the summer and I’ve found a ton that are just simple, light and flowy and that I can throw on. They are polyester so it’s not the best material but it feels fairly silky and looks cute and flowy! Slim nude flip flops. These are SO comfortable – they are the slim flip flops but with memory foam! So much more comfortable than other versions I’ve tried over the years. MEDIA My Favorite Bad Decision. Best read of the month, hands down. And I read SO MANY GOOD ONES this month!! The Dating Detectives podcast. One of you recommended this to me last month and I LOVE it. KIDS Girl’s athletic shorts. Emilia needed new gym shorts for school and I ordered a pair of these – she ADORES them! They have tights under, a tennis ball pocket and are so super cute. Dinosaur autobrush. Jordan has loathed brushing his teeth from day one. This doesn’t replace his regular brush, but this has made him LOVE brushing his teeth in the morning and night! I wish I had found it two years ago. The Lord of the Rings box set. Max is currently reading this and this is the set we have. We have the paperback, but I kind of want to get him the hard copies! [none of this is sponsored, i just love to tell you what i love every month! there are a few general affiliate links above! xo]",
