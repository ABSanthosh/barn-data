This was a member favorite from SK Cooking Club, and given the current circumstances, I figured it belonged here as well. I know everyone is trying to limit grocery runs, but I think we can make this work. Some members did half cauli, half chicken. Another mentioned she did sweet potatoes and broccoli into the sauce. If you don’t have tomato paste, you can use a can of crushed tomatoes or even tomato sauce and it’ll work. I know there are more details to true, authentic tikka masala but now does not feel like the time for details? Let me know if you have questions!I hope you are well. Feeding ourselves and our people is one of the most anchoring acts we have right now. I wish you wellness!CAULIFLOWER TIKKA MASALA // Serves 4Tikka is a takeout favorite but can often be so heavy. Since we have some dairy-free folks we swapped out the yogurt and cream with full fat coconut milk. We have tested this with both chicken and cauli, so you can adapt it to your family’s preference.To swap chicken for cauli, repeat the same method of seasoning the chicken as you would the cauliflower with a third of the spice blend. Cut 1 ½ lbs. of boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs into 1” cubes, toss in the spice blend, and brown in batches, over medium heat, until golden on all sides. Remove from the pan, set aside, and continue with your sauce. Once the sauce has thickened to your liking, add in the browned chicken and allow to simmer in the sauce for 10 minutes until cooked through.INGREDIENTS2 Tbsp. yellow curry powder1 ½ tsp. cumin1 tsp. paprika1 tsp. turmeric1 tsp. coriander¼ tsp. allspice or cinnamon½ tsp. red pepper flakes, or more to taste1 ½ tsp. kosher salt2 Tbsp. avocado oil, divided1 large head cauliflower, cut into florets 1 medium yellow onion, diced5 cloves garlic, grated1 Tbsp. freshly grated ginger 1 6 oz. can tomato paste¾ cup low-sodium vegetable stock1 14 oz. can full fat coconut milkzest and juice of 1 small lemonGenerous handful well chopped cilantro2 cup cooked basmati, brown, or cauli rice, for serving¼ cup salted, toasted cashewsnaan, optionalyogurt, optionalDIRECTIONSPreheat oven to 425.’In a small bowl, mix together curry, cumin, paprika, turmeric, coriander, cinnamon/allspice, red pepper flakes, and salt. On a rimmed baking sheet, arrange cauli florets so there is space between them, drizzle with a tablespoon of avocado oil and toss with about a third of the spice mix. Transfer to the oven and roast for 30 minutes until just browned and tender.Meanwhile, make your sauce. In a large Dutch oven, heat the remaining oil over medium. When the oil is shimmering, add in the onion and cook until golden, about 4 minutes. Add in garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant.
