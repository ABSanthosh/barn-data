All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Photo: Vicky Wasik ; Food Stylist: Rachel PerlmutterWhen Ronzoni announced the discontinuation of its pastina in the winter of 2023, people took to social media to share how bummed they were to no longer have the option to buy boxes of the tiny star-shaped morsels from the company. Barilla and Target offer versions of the nostalgic pasta shape, but if you’re a Ronzoni fan, you’ll be glad to know you can finally buy the brand’s pastina during your next grocery store run.Recently, Ronzoni announced on Instagram that pastina is back and available on store shelves, and people are eagerly rushing to buy it. One person commented on the post saying, “It’s back? I’m thrilled!” while another user mentioned, “Yay!!!! I was heartbroken when you guys took it off the shelves!!”Pastina is known as the Italian pasta perfect for soups, and it’s a hit with young kids, sometimes being one of the first foods a child tries, especially in Italy. So many people feel nostalgic when they eat pastina, whether it’s a traditional preparation cooked in broth or something more adventurous. Of course, Ronzoni’s January 2023 announcement that the brand was discontinuing pastina was a bummer for fans of the pasta. “Unfortunately, our long-term supplier informed us that they would no longer be making Ronzoni Pastina as of January 2023,” the company said in an Instagram post at the time. The brand said that it wasn’t able to find a way to keep making pastina “in the same beloved small shape, size, and standards you have come to expect from Ronzoni.” Loyal fans weren’t shy about expressing their disappointment. One person said, “Nooooooo, pastina was all three of my boys’ first food; it’s a tradition.” While another user called out, “How can you do this? I loved pastina.”Cut to the end of 2024, and shoppers have already spotted Ronzoni Pastina on grocery shelves. In the Instagram announcement, the brand said that “Ronzoni Pastina’s availability can vary by region,” and you can check if your local store carries it using the store locator.",
