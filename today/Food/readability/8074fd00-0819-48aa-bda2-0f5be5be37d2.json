All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Nina ElderWhen a celebration comes up, one of the quickest ways to make an exciting dessert is to grab a box of cake mix and turn it into cute cupcakes. If you find yourself doing this often, you’ll want to pay attention. Gone are the days of frosting cupcakes with a simple, rustic topping. With this easy hack going viral on social media, you’ll be able to ice like a professional.A London-based bakery, Primrose, recently shared a video showing how they frost their cupcakes, and it quickly racked up nearly 1 million views. In the clip, one of their staff members gracefully decorates cupcakes using a simple yet brilliant technique.In the video, the professional baker starts by adding a generous amount of frosting to the center of the cupcake. She then uses an icing spatula, which has a flexible blade that makes it easy to spread and smooth the buttercream. Using the spatula, she smooths the frosting in a counterclockwise motion until it forms a nice, flat base. To finish, she makes one final swoop starting from the center to give the cupcake a fancy, professional look.Make sure to clean the icing spatula after each use to remove any leftover frosting. This will give you the best chance at achieving beautiful, professional-looking desserts. Plus, you’ll want to use room-temperature frosting. This hack won’t work if the frosting is too thick and unspreadable.People on Instagram couldn’t stop raving about how easy this technique is. One user commented, “That hand swirl is so cool,” while another noted that it might take some practice to perfect: “I’m a pro with a piping bag, but this signature swirl is harder than it looks! Yours are perfect.” Whether you find this trick effortless or a bit tricky to master, it’s still a great way to make your cupcakes really stand out.",
