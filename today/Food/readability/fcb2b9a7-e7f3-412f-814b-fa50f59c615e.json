It’s one part wedge salad, the fork and steak knife kind, something I am so into I talked my podcast co-host Kenji (okay, it wasn’t hard) into dedicating a whole episode to it. And it contains cabbage, and not just cabbage but Napa cabbage, which I think deserves more credit as a salad green. [This can be convenient to know as it often comes in heads large enough to feed a small family for a week.] Napa cabbage is a little leafy, a little crunchy, and yet kind of juicy too and I’ve used it, sliced thin, in everything from this Italian-style salad to a classic Caesar. Speaking of Caesar salads, this salad answers questions I don’t think anyone asked, such as … What if we replaced the anchovies or Worcestershire sauce in Caesar dressing with fish sauce? What if we replaced the Dijon with miso? What if we replaced the lemon juice with rice vinegar? What if we replaced the coddled egg with mayo? What if we got an umami boost not from parmesan cheese, but toasted sesame seeds and sesame oil? What if we topped it not with croutons but crispy shallots? What if we used Napa cabbage instead of romaine lettuce? “Well Deb, it would no longer be a Caesar salad,” the pedants will correctly say but these questions ran circles in my brain for the better part of a month before I caved and this turned out to be the wildly delicious answer — a refreshingly crunchy, busy, dynamic salad we can’t get enough of. I can’t wait for you to try it too. The Smitten Kitchen Classroom Wishlist Project 2024 is going strong! In the US, a tremendous number of teachers don’t get the funding they need to set their classrooms up for success. Most will end up paying out of their own pockets to buy educational materials, which is all wrong. I’ve asked teachers to send me their wishlists in hopes that we can help clear as many as possible, as we did the last two summers. Help out if you feel you’re able — you will unquestionably make a teacher’s (and their students) day! [Project information. Direct link to spreadsheet. A little article that came out about the project yesterday!] Video Napa Cabbage Wedge with Miso Dressing If you hate mayo, you can try plain yogurt instead. However, you might find that you like the dressing with neither; it just ends up thinner and more robust in flavor. You’ll probably have more shallots than you need but I cannot bring myself to make the effort to fry shallots and not have extras for next time. Assembly1 to 1 1/2 pounds napa cabbage (often half of a large one)2 large shallotsNeutral oil for frying6 to 8 radishes, diced small2 scallions, thinly slicedToasted sesame seeds Dressing2 tablespoons white miso1 medium garlic clove, minced2 teaspoons fish sauce2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar, plus extra to drizzle3 tablespoons toasted sesame oil2 tablespoons neutral oil1 teaspoon granulated sugar2 tablespoons mayonnaiseSalt and freshly ground black pepper To wash and crisp your cabbage: Cut the cabbage lengthwise into quarters, leaving the end intact. Lower into a large bowl of cold water. Let sit for 10 minutes, but longer is fine too. [I’ve neglected mine for 1 to 2 hours before while preparing other things.] Remove from water, shaking off excess and letting any sand or debris fall to the bottom of the bowl. Place on a thick kitchen towel and pat dry. To crisp shallots: Peel and thinly slice shallots. A mandoline is ideal for this as it ensures shallots cook evenly, but I sliced mine by hand. Place in a small-to-medium skillet and barely cover with oil. Turn heat to medium-high and cook shallots, watching carefully, until they’re just lightly golden brown, then turn the heat off and let the residual heat of the oil take them a shade darker, to a medium copper brown. [The color will change quickly at this point, and I’ve had to toss burnt shallots many, many times when I didn’t watch closely.] If you’ve sliced your shallots by hand, you’ll find that some pieces are done sooner; you can use thin tongs or a fork to fish them out sooner. Drain in a sieve, reserving the oil for the next time you want to fry shallots. Spread crispy shallots on two layers of paper towel and season immediately with salt, then transfer shallots to a bowl. If you keep them on the towel too long, the oil on the towel will soften them, which will be sad. Make the dressing: In a medium bowl, whisk miso, garlic, fish sauce, and 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar to combine and smooth out miso. Whisk in sesame oil, a tablespoon at a time, then neutral oil and sugar. Add mayo and whisk to smoothly combine. Add sriracha or chili oil (I used some from a jar of chili crisp) to taste. Add salt, if needed, but it is unlikely you will. You could also add a bit more miso, instead of salt. Assemble salad: Cut cabbage quarters into smaller wedges and arrange on a serving plate. It’s not mandatory, but I like to drizzle the cabbage wedges with 1 to 2 teaspoons rice vinegar before adding the dressing for extra brightness. Drizzle dressing over to taste, then scatter the wedges with radishes, scallions, toasted sesame seeds, and crispy shallots. Eat right away. Do ahead: Extra washed cabbage, dressing, and shallots keep in the fridge for 4 to 5 days. Store separately.
