  "description": "The internet is a hottttt place right now, so I’ll just pretend we’re catching up on the porch, sharing a glass of wine and updating you on the bits and bobs of our little life. Like a Christmas letter in October?Curran is back at school and albeit strange and distanced, he’s so happy. He loves wearing his face shield with the mask as well so he looks extra cautious and also like a stormtrooper and I just love how he marches to his own drum. He’s been in skateboard class, still obsessed with the ocean and his Dad and food in general. Cleo has been tough lately. Lots of big feelings and big reactions and if I don’t get some break from her drama before she is a teenager? Lord help us. She learned the word “shit” from The Chicks new album, which she requests every time we get in the car. I told her it was a really bad word for poop which unfortunately makes it more intriguing for that 4-6 age range. My bad. When she is happy, she has tons of personality, affectionate, a great sense of humor and pays attention to detail and is therefore quite thoughtful. She LOVES Curran, and that bond may be my favorite thing about being a parent. Work is steady-ish. A few speed bumps (actually a really big one) which I’ll tell you more about when I know more. I’m pretty creatively toasted, but I feel grateful to have a job and the schedule we do in the current state of things. We’re trying to turn over a holiday ebook in a few weeks so if we can pull it off, that will be exciting. I love love my new nephew! New babies are so clean and cuddly and seeing my sister and brother-in-law adjust into parenting is both nostalgic and beautiful. I do think it’s a stunning metamorphosis of a person, and tender to watch of people you care for so deeply. I’m reading Small Great Things by Jodi Piccoult. Looking for an easy, local-ish place to go for our 10-year wedding anniversary next month. That’s the short of it for now. Lots of things and feelings going on for so many right now. Always in pursuit of good company and real conversation. I hope you are finding slivers of that. This recipe has been popular over on SKCC, so I thought it should live here too. We use a mix of legumes, some bulgur for texture. Your favorite broth or stock, homemade if you’re fancy. I do stir kale in at the end because I like my veggie chili to indeed, be full of vegetables, and I’m sure some real chili conisseurs would consider that a disgrace. It’s 2020! Live your life. Our favorite way to serve this is over extra crispy roasted sweet potato tots. The brand Alexia makes our favorites, speaking from tot fans over here. Or over a baked and split potato in general, makes this meal so filling and easy to prep ahead. As it goes with chili and stews, the toppings are crucial. Don’t skip those!We’re on the tail end of outdoor dinner season in CA and I swear by stews and chilis being an excellent meal to feed to friends. This soup is a favorite. Because I will forever encourage feeding others, pandemic or not, maybe you can pull off a drive-way pumpkin carving next week? Chili for all? That’s on our calendar. Wishing you wellness and warm bowls of something delicious. VEGGIE CHILIServes 6I wrote this recipe for SKCC, and it’s been popular. Even the omnivorous folks say they don’t miss the meat because there is enough flavor and texture going on. I’ve been refilling my spice jars with dry spices from Thrive Market (if you use that link, you get a discount on your first order!). They are affordable and fresh. While you’re there and filling up your cart for free shipping, you can buy beans, grains, tomato products etc. and you’ll have pantry staples on hand for this chili at all times. Speaking of omnivores, there has been reported success in adding a pound of ground chicken/turkey/beef to this recipe. Add it to the pot to brown and cook through after the vegetables, and add 2 more cups broth to keep everything hydrated. This will increase the serving yield to 6-8, and if that’s too much, this gifts and freezes well. Ingredients2 Tbsp. of avocado oil or other neutral oil1 medium yellow onion - finely chopped1 jalapeño - seeded \u0026 minced2 large portobello mushrooms - wiped clean \u0026 chopped super smallsea salt to tastepepper to taste1 red bell pepper - finely diced1 yellow bell pepper - finely diced1 small sweet potato - peeled \u0026 diced small4 cloves of garlic - grated1 1/2 Tbsp. of chili powder1 Tbsp. of cumin2 tsp. of cocoa powder1 tsp. of smoked paprika1 Tbsp. of chipotle peppers in adobo - minced small or blended1/3 cup of brown or green lentils1/3 cup of bulgur14 oz. tomato sauce28 oz. crushed fire-roasted tomatoes3 cups of vegetable broth1 cup of beer or brewed coffee2 tsp. of coconut aminos or soy sauce1 can of black beans - drained1 cup of frozen corn kernels2 cups of chopped kale (optional)DirectionsHeat a large pot or Dutch-oven over medium heat. Heat the avocado oil. Get chopping, my friend!To the pot, add the onions, jalapeño, mushrooms and a big pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté those down for about 10-15 minutes until water is released and the mushrooms begin to brown. We really want to cook the water off here. Add the bell peppers, sweet potato, garlic and sauté about 5 minutes until the just begin to soften.Add the chili powder, cumin, cocoa, smoked paprika, and chipotle to the pot and sauté them for another minute. Add the lentils, bulgur, tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, broth, beer or coffee and coconut aminos. Bring everything to a gentle simmer, uncovered, and let it all cook for about 35 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the lentils and bulgur are cooked through. Add the black beans, corn, and kale if using, taste for seasoning and adjust as needed. More salt? Maybe more coconut aminos. Spicier? Add more chipotle or chili powder. Let it all simmer another 10 minutes to warm through and wilt the greens.Serve your bowls with a generous amount of toppings. Chili will keep for a week in the fridge.
