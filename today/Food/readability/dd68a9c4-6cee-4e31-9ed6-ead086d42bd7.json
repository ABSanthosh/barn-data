  "description": "We made another ebook! Sprouted Kitchen Holidays is a collection of a handful of my favorite recipes from SK Cooking Club, plus a few more, and we made a beautiful online resource for your seasonal table. There are 25 recipes that feel good for celebrating, regardless that this year will be different than any other. Check the link to the shop page for more details and reach out if there are any questions! I am including the recipe for our family tradition of Christmas morning cinnamon rolls here. They have a little bit of baked sweet potato in them to keep them tender, but are by all means decadent. You can start these the day before, and let them sit in the fridge overnight, and the early bird pulls them out while the oven preheats Christmas morning. I’ve also heard they freeze well! Once you cut and load them in your baking dish, cover them with a layer of parchment paper and freeze. The evening before, leave them on the counter at room temperature to thaw and proof, before baking the following morning. We have a post coming up next week for the savory crowd, albeit just as creamy and delicious, before we all take a sharp turn into kale and salads come January. The ebook is available in the shop, and should you need a virtual gift, or want to sync up your menu with someone you cannot be with the holiday, there is a gift option as well. Thank you for your support of all things Sprouted Kitchen, and wishing you wellness into the new year. Sweet Potato Cinnamon RollsServes 8-10I can often makes swaps for gluten-free baked goods, but not here. I don’t know the science of gluten and yeast. The dairy however, can be replaced with a vegan butter and non-dairy milk of choice. If the sweet potato step here sounds fussy, 1/4 cup canned pumpkin puree will do the trick.Heads up! Start these the day before you need to bake them! Ingredients For the dough 1 cup of warm milk (no warmer than 110°) 2 1/2 tsp. of active dry yeast 2 eggs 1/3 cup of unsalted butter - melted1/3 cup of cooked sweet potatoes flesh 1/2 tsp. of sea salt 1/3 cup of cane sugar 4 1/2 cups of all purpose flour, divided For the filling 1 cup of light brown sugar 2 Tbsp. of cinnamon1/3 cup of unsalted butter - room temp 1/2 cup of chopped pecans - optional For the frosting 4 oz. of cream cheese 3 Tbsp. of unsalted butter 1/4 cup of maple syrup 3/4 cup of powdered sugar 1 tsp. of vanilla extract pinch of sea salt Directions Warm the milk (not super hot, just above body temp.). Stir in the yeast and let it sit for a few minutes to dissolve. Into a stand mixer with knead attachment, add the milk mixture, eggs, incorporate them in well. Stir in the butter, potato flesh, salt and sugar to combine. Add 4 1/4 cups of the flour, 1 cup at a time, reserve the last 1/4 cup for rolling them out. Work everything together to combine for a minute, then dump the dough on a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough by pushing it with the heels of your hands and pulling it back to you on repeat for about 5 minutes. Roll it into a smooth little dough baby, cover it with a dish towel or plastic wrap and let it rise until it doubles in size. This time of year, since it’s a little chillier, this will take no less than an hour, likely two. Go do something else and just leave it alone. While you’re waiting, stir the brown sugar, cinnamon and butter together. It should look like a thick paste. Roll the dough out into a 1/4” thick rectangle, about 14” in length. No need to bust out a ruler, just guess. Spread the brown sugar butter mixture all across the top. Sprinkle pecan or walnut pieces in there if you like nuts. Starting with the long side, roll the dough down into a log. Cut the log into roughly 3” thick pieces (you can make them smaller or larger to your preference). Arrange them with an inch of space between in one or two greased baking dishes. I don’t need 14 rolls for just my family, so I bake half in a 10” cast iron skillet and put the rest in a second baking dish to gift). (This much can be done a day in advance and leave them covered in the fridge. Whomever wakes up first in the morning, should pull them from the fridge so they can rest and rise for at least one hour before baking. You can also freeze them, and pull them out to the counter when you go to bed the evening prior to wanting to bake them) Cover the rolls loosely with a dish towel and let them rise another hour. Preheat the oven to 350°. Bake the rolls on the middle rack for 20 minutes. While the rolls bake, whip up your frosting. In a stand mixer or with an electric mixer (or by hand with your strong muscles), mix the cream cheese and butter together until well combined and smooth (about 5 minutes in a stand mixer). Add the maple, powdered sugar, vanilla and pinch of salt and mix again. While the rolls are still warm but not piping hot, spread the frosting across the top and let it drip into the crannies. Enjoy warm!
