  "description": "Favorite Trader Joe’s Beauty Products! Over the years, I’ve tried quite a few Trader Joe’s beauty products because I love seeing how they compare as ‘dupes’ for higher-end brands. While I’ve had some misses in my experimentation, I’ve also had a lot of success. If you’re looking for some inexpensive products that work, here are my favorite Trader Joe’s Beauty Products and why I like them! Let’s talk hair first! I love this hair mask. I try to use it once a week- especially on the ends of my hair that get dry. Sometimes I will use it instead of conditioner. I am also enjoying this leave-in-conditioner. It’s all the rage and apparently an Ouai dupe. I spray a little bit into my hands and work it into wet hair and it helps my wavy hair wave up! Some people complain about the smell but I quite like it. There’s something about it that reminds me of a trip to Europe. It goes away after a bit. Pardon the dry shampoo bottle—it melted in my car… This dry shampoo is kind of weird to apply, but it works! I also really like the smell- it kinda reminds me of the cologne- Polo Sport. Definitely great if you get greasy bangs like I do. One container lasts A LONG TIME. I love this jojoba oil. I put it on my face after I shower and it soaks right in. It’s also great for the ends of my hair. I’ll apply it to the bottom half of my hair before bed and pull it up in a bun. Whatever I have left on my hands, I rub on my elbows and knees. Hooray for skin being moisturized! My favorite facial sunscreen ever! This one is supposed to be a Supergoop dupe (say that three times fast). If you’re also sensitive to lotions and don’t like the feel of them on your hand and face, this one is for you! It goes on easily and keeps you covered! Cooper doesn’t mind it either, which is important because he needs to sweat through it while playing baseball. I keep this microdermabrasion scrub in the shower. My skin has been pretty dry lately so the fine grit in this scrub helps slough off. It’s pretty inexpensive and I like it! I keep this in my baseball bag. Even though it’s for the face, I use it a lot for cuticles and sometimes I rub some between my palms and smooth flyaway hairs with it. It’s got a pleasant rose smell. I’m a fan! Obsessed! This one is supposed to be a Laneige lip mask dupe. I’ve never tried the original ($24!?) but I am quite pleased with how soft it makes my lips and the flavor brightens my mood. It’s kinda like vanilla frosting. I have one at my desk right now and I am going to apply as you read this. I absolutely love this almond exfoliant soap. Anything almondy is my favorite. I believe there are bits of oats in the soap that help you exfoliate dead skin. I’m a fan! How about you? What am I missing out on? What are your Favorite Trader Joe’s Beauty Products? Oh, and if you’re shopping at Trader Joe’s soon, here are my favorite pantry items. The post Favorite Trader Joe’s Beauty Products appeared first on Shutterbean.",
