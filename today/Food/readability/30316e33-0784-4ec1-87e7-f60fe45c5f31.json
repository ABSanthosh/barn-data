If you are looking for another salad option for Spring or for Easter dinner — check out my Warm Spring Salad. Vegan, gluten-free, grain-free, nut-free, refined sugar-free, soy-free ★★★★★5 from 27 reviews Yield4 servings Prep time25 minutes Cook time30 minutes Total time55 minutes Protein-packed and perfect for spring, this French green lentil salad makes a lovely side dish, main course, or spring potluck dish. Roasted potatoes and asparagus are folded into the salad along with a tangy mustard-lemon dressing. I also roasted the red onion, but I think next time I might leave the onion raw for a fresh crunch. I imagine this salad would also be fantastic with some cooked quinoa mixed in or using any seasonal vegetables you prefer. The dressing makes a lot - 2/3 cup - so I prefer to stir in half of the dressing into the salad and then serve the rest of the dressing on the side to drizzle on top. This dressing is inspired by one I came across in It's All Good. Ingredients FOR THE SALAD:1 cup uncooked French green lentils/du Puy lentils (about 2 1/2 cups cooked)3 medium yellow potatoes, diced (about 3 1/2 cups)1 bunch asparagus, ends broken off and chopped1/2 medium red onion, diced (about 1 1/2 cups)1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, dividedhandful minced fresh dill, for garnish (optional)FOR THE DRESSING (makes 2/3 cup):2 tablespoons coarse seeded/old fashioned mustard (see photo in post)2 tablespoons Dijon mustard4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil3-4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, to tastepinch or two fine grain sea salt or pink saltup to 1 teaspoon pure maple syrup, to taste (optional) Directions Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C) and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Rinse lentils in a fine mesh sieve. Place lentils in a medium pot along with 3 cups of water. Bring water to a boil and then reduce heat to medium and simmer the lentils for about 18-20 minutes, or until tender. Drain off water and season lentils with salt (such as Herbamare). Place chopped potatoes on one baking sheet and drizzle with 1/2 tablespoon oil. Toss to coat and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Roast the potatoes for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, place the asparagus on the other baking sheet (and the red onion if you prefer to roast it too - see headnote) and drizzle with 1/2 tbsp. oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. After the potatoes have roasted for 15 minutes, flip the potatoes and return them to the oven along with the asparagus (and red onion if you are roasting that) for another 12-15 minutes. The potatoes should be golden on the bottom when ready and the asparagus will be tender. Add roasted veggies into a large bowl along with the lentils and gently toss to combine. Meanwhile, prepare the dressing by whisking all of the dressing ingredients together. I love a tangy dressing with a bite so I used 4 tbsp. lemon juice. If you prefer a less acidic dressing you might want to add more olive oil or you can also experiment with adding a touch of maple syrup (the sweetness will offset a bit of the bite). It's definitely a dressing you can play around with! Pour half of the dressing onto the veggies and lentils in the bowl and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the salad warm with a garnish of fresh dill (optional), with the rest of the dressing served on the side. Nutrition Information (click to expand) If you aren’t a fan of mustard dressings, I recommend making the Creamy Avocado-Potato Salad recipe in my first cookbook The Oh She Glows Cookbook (p.107) It’s received great feedback and it’s perfect for spring as well. Have a fun weekend everyone!",
