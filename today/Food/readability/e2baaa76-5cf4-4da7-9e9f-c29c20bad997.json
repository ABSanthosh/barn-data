Food Stylist: Simon Andrews.May 15, 2025At long last, warm weather is ours. I declare picnic season open for business. But I use the term “picnic” to describe any of several dining variations. It could be a proper outdoor meal on the lawn, at the beach or in a boat. Or a feast on the front stoop. It can even be a picnic indoors if the weather isn’t cooperating. The picnic spirit is casual, convivial, the opposite of formal. The food is simple but mouthwatering.For this picnic menu, I craved kebabs like those I enjoyed in Istanbul. Kebabs made with ground meat proliferate throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and beyond. Ground lamb is most common, but chicken can be a good choice, too, as it is here. You make a well-seasoned savory mixture and form it into cylinders around a skewer, ready to grill.Recipe: Oven Chicken KebabsIf you have them, those traditional flat metal skewers are ideal. But I’ve used bamboo skewers and even wooden disposable chopsticks in a pinch — though you’ll want to soak any wooden skewers in water before using. For that matter, though, it’s also common to have kebabs without skewers, formed into small patties and pan-fried, an easy option.Made with ground chicken (the dark meat kind, not the breast meat), these kebabs are generously spiced with red pepper, paprika, cumin, sumac and onion. They can be formed well in advance of the meal and refrigerated for several days.These skewers can easily be roasted on a baking sheet in a hot oven, and I had the best result cooking these kebabs under the broiler. For grilling over coals, I find chicken kebabs need a fine meshed grate or perforated vegetable grill pan. Whatever way you cook them, or whatever their shape, they are fine picnic fare and a great alternative to burgers. You’ll want to serve them with lavash flatbread or pita.To round out the meal, offer a couple of fresh summery salads. These are visually impressive and beautiful served in big bowls or on platters.Recipes: Herbed Cucumber-Yogurt Salad | Tomato-Feta SaladA cucumber salad dressed with tart yogurt and lots of chopped dill and mint makes a cooling, pleasantly refreshing and saucy accompaniment. This is a handy, brightly flavored salad to make all summer long.Cherry tomatoes make a colorful zesty salad that’s good on its own or very welcome as a picnic side dish. They are halved and tossed with a garlicky vinaigrette, roughly chopped olives, cilantro and parsley and a shower of crumbled feta.Recipe: Sesame-Coconut ShortbreadsImageThese lightly sweet shortbread cookies are nutty with tahini and sesame seeds.Credit...David Malosh for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Simon Andrews.Dessert can be fruit or ice cream, but I suggest these delicious shortbread-like cookies made with tahini, sesame seeds and a touch of coconut. Easy to transport and not overly sweet, they make the most divine nibbling for your picnic pleasure.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT",
