Hosting doesn’t have to be a chore, and with a little bit of forethought, gathering your loved ones for a meal can be what it’s supposed to be: fun. We know that more than anyone, so we tapped the most brilliant hosts we know (us) for our best advice for surviving hosting season. From when to take the cheese out to how to make a housewarming extra special, here’s what we do when company’s coming over. “My learned-the-hard-way advice is to remember that your job as host is not putting on a show, it's making people feel welcome and at ease. Have drinks ready for guests. Encourage them to wander around—don't you, too, love checking out other peoples' houses? Do a seating chart in advance, so people don't have to fend for themselves. Keep an eye on people's glasses so they don't have to ask for more wine or water. And have fun—if you're having fun, they will too!” —Amanda Hesser, Founder and Executive Chair “My friend Katherine, who owns a whole store devoted to dinner parties, Big Night, shared this piece of advice that’ll never forget: always let your cheese rest. Take it out a half hour before guests arrive, and it’ll taste like actual cheese, and not the inside of your fridge. It also lets your softer cheese, like Brie, look all romantic on your cheeseboard.” —Julie Vadnal, Editorial Director “Make the bathroom experience special. At my housewarming party I had nice dimmed lighting, single-use hand towels in a tray (the hand towels always get so gross at a party) and a speaker playing a different playlist than the rest of the party (I went for female country classics from the 90s and 00s!). It makes it feel like a bit of a retreat from the larger party and lets guests catch their breath.” —Jackson Fust, Senior Director, Merchandising \u0026 Planning “Always be finishing up making food (either plating or last minute cooking) as guests arrive. It makes people feel less pressured to be ‘on’ right when they get to my house. I also try to have eucalyptus hanging from my shower to make my bathroom smell heavenly.” —Kelly Kenneally, Graphic Designer From Our Shop \"Any time I'm planning to serve a dessert (which is always), I try to make it either that morning or the day before. Most baked goods you'd be serving for dessert will last a night in the fridge, but if you're worried about freshness or want to serve something warm, like a pie, you could assemble ahead and pop it in the oven during dinner.” — Nea Arentzen, Content Creator “I used to break out my best plates and silverware, but now I have no shame setting out bamboo plates and pairing them with nice platters that I've collected throughout the years to serve everything family style. I feel like it balances the use of the bamboo dinnerware.” —Cesar Perez, Content Creator “If you're having a big group, keep any snacks or hors d'oeuvres in a few different places instead of just all on one table. Everyone wants to be near the food, so you’ll maximize the space and keep everyone from congregating in the same spot. Also, the big light is usually a vibe killer. Skip overhead lighting and opt for lamps, candles, an other warmer lights.” —Chelsea Burnside, Social Media Associate “When I'm hosting for friends, I think it's realistic to delegate. I'll do the main, I’ll ask someone to bring a side, then someone else to bring the drinks.” —Tam Morales, Social Producer \"Make a big pot of coffee. Whether it's a mid-day hang or late night dinner party, a good, hot cup of joe is the perfect way to either a) cap off the event or b) keep it rolling. Bonus points if you serve it in something cool—like this French press.\" - Paul Hagopian, Editor \"As simple as it sounds, having a pitcher of water prepared ahead of time, chilling in the fridge complete with lemon, and maybe a few additional flares like herbs or cucumbers is a nice touch to a dinner party. Especially when you use a pitcher as adorable as the Serax Fish Bottle, or the Dansk Købenstyle Wrapped Handle Water Pitcher.\" - Julia Nelson, Senior Manager, Social \u0026 Video What are your go-to hosting tricks?
