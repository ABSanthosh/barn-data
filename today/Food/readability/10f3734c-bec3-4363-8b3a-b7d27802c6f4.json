According to an internal document reviewed by The New York Times, Ms. Burrell, 55, was “discovered in the shower unconscious and unresponsive surrounded by approximately (100) assorted pills.”Ms. Burrell was a beloved chef with a larger-than-life personality. Her death prompted an outpouring of support from fellow Food Network stars and fans of her shows, which included “Secrets of a Restaurant Chef” and “Worst Cooks in America.”She rose to fame as the sous chef for Mario Batali on “Iron Chef America.” Her no-nonsense, outgoing persona caught the attention of the network, which offered Ms. Burrell her own show, “Secrets of a Restaurant Chef,” premiering in 2008. She remained a constant presence on the network, accumulating legions of fans for her culinary prowess, platinum swoop of hair and ebullient demeanor.Despite her success at the network, there were recent hints of tension. Namely, the Food Network announced in January that Ms. Burrell would not host the upcoming season of “Worst Cooks,” which premiered that month, with no explanation as to why the change was made. After her death, the network announced that it would air the chef’s already-filmed final season, titled “Worst Cooks in America: Talented and Terrible,” co-hosted by the chef Gabe Bertaccini.Ms. Burrell’s last public appearance was at an improv show at Second City New York in Brooklyn on June 16, the night before her death. It was her first performance since taking classes at the comedy club.
