All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Photos: (Demi Lovato) bella, Shutterstock, Laura Rege, Alex LepeDemi Lovato is in her self-proclaimed “Martha Stewart era.” “I’ve been cooking more than ever and have been starting to feel so much more joy in the kitchen,” she tells The Kitchn. Lovato even makes videos titled “Cooking with Demi” on her TikTok for fans to follow along and try out her favorite recipes. “I’ve even started to find the confidence to try out brand-new, and sometimes more difficult, recipes.”So, it only makes sense that the singer decided to partner with the kitchenware company bella. “I wanted to find a brand that could help me on this new journey that wasn’t too complicated, but rather made cooking easy and enjoyable,” says Lovato of the easy-to-use, space-saving products.For this edition of Cooking Diary, Demi Lovato walks us through her favorite dinner to make, the snack she always keeps backstage, the dish she’s most famous for with friends and family, and more.Credit: Photos: (Demi Lovato) bella, Molly Allen, Alex LepeWho taught you how to cook? Did you always like it?I taught myself how to cook from recipes. It was very overwhelming at first, but once I began to feel the accomplishments of completing those recipes I fell in love with cooking.Is there a shortcut you rely on?I love to have all of my ingredients premeasured before diving into a recipe. Once you get in the flow of cooking or baking, it helps the process run so much smoother.Do you have a go-to lazy dinner option you love?I have really been loving making myself a kale salad that’s inspired by the Erewhon Kale Salad. It’s easy to throw together. I put my own spin on it by adding grilled chicken.Congratulations on your engagement! What’s your favorite dish to cook for your fiancé?It is honestly always changing. I have been trying a lot of new recipes recently, and he is the best taste tester. His favorite dish though is definitely “Marry Me Chicken.”What snack do you like to have on set or backstage?Is there a dish you’re famous for with friends and family?I have a new brownie recipe that I have loved sharing with family and friends. I love having them ready for whoever stops by the house!Do you have a secret ingredient when it comes to cooking?",
