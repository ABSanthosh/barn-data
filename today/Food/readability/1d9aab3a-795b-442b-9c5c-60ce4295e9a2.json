All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Photo: Alex Lepe; Prop Styling: Tom HoerupSipping on a cup of coffee is an essential part of my morning routine, but as regularly as I drink it, I’ll admit that I keep my brews pretty basic. I’m usually half asleep when I’m making it, after all, so ease is the name of the game. That’s why I’ve been considering upgrading to a Nespresso machine for a while, having heard all of the rave reviews from my coworkers. It makes complex, café-quality beverages with only a pod and the press of a button — and that low-effort, high-reward factor is exactly what I’m looking for.Speaking of my coworkers, a number of them rely on the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Coffee and Espresso Maker whenever they go into our New York City office. “I was never a fan of single-serve coffee makers, “but honestly, the Nespresso won me over,” Deputy Commerce Editor Alicia says. “No matter which pod I pick, the flavor is so rich and full that it’s as nice as the expensive coffee shop next door to the office.” Right now, the machine is going for a seriously low price of $99, so I’m planning on buying one for my own kitchen so I can access it on the regular. Here’s why you should grab one for yourself (or a coffee-loving giftee), too.What Is the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Coffee and Espresso Maker by Breville?You’ll be immediately enamored with this machine at first sip. It produces five different cup sizes, ranging from 5 to 12 ounces, in addition to single and double espresso shots, which you’ll have the option of brewing hot or over ice. It does it all with a single capsule, which you can stock up on in a wide range of flavors. (Pro tip: When contributor Ever put dozens of them to the test, she determined that the versatile Volluto capsule is “the most crowd-pleasing of them all.” That would be a great place to start!)Just insert it into the machine, press the button, and watch it work its magic after it heats up for half a minute. The result is a drink that could’ve been brewed by a barista — the pods are designed to protect the coffee’s taste and freshness. (In fact, Nespresso claims its capsules make coffee last 50 times longer than it would inside of a bag.) Once your cup is ready in a couple of minutes, you can recycle the pod through the brand’s special program.I would be remiss not to mention the compact design, another huge benefit that this machine has going for it. Instead of taking up an enormous portion of your countertop, it’s only just under 9 inches wide, and you can remove the water tank for extra versatility.What Amazon Shoppers Are Saying “Nespresso Vertuo Pop is compact, stylish, and so easy to use! Just pop in a pod, press a button, and enjoy a rich, creamy coffee every time. The red color adds a nice touch to my kitchen, and the machine is super easy to clean. Perfect for anyone who wants quality coffee with minimal effort. Highly recommended!” — hossein “Easy to use and clean. Easy to load water and the pods. Wonderfully versatile with the ability to make a full cup or an espresso without me having to do literally anything. The pod tells the machine what to do. The price per pod is very worth the quality of the result you get.” — Brian H Mayo “I really wanted a Nespresso machine … Tried out a couple and ended with this one. So far, so good. The biggest deciding factor was, it needed to have a broad range of coffee sizes (only 2 models can go up to 12 oz), and the other model I tried had a ton of issues within the first two weeks. I’ve had the Pop + for about a month and no issue. Coffee is always consistent, and you can’t ask for an easier process. It’s one button. No leaking, coffee is always hot, and small enough that it can fit any size kitchen.” — Natalie Considering how expensive coffee shops have become — lattes can go for $7 or $8 a pop — the amount you’ll save with this machine is astronomical. Factor in the 24% off sale price, and it becomes a no-brainer.Buy: Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Coffee and Espresso Maker by Breville, $99 (normally $129.95)My Kitchn HelperGet our favorite editor-tested and -approved finds sent twice a week to your inbox.",
