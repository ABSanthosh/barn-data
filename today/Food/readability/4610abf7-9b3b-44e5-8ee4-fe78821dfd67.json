All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Amanda Alamsyah / ShutterstockIt’s (almost) the most wonderful time of the year, and shoppers are racing to their nearby grocery stores to get their hands on the season’s must-have soda (or pop, depending on where you live). In 2013, Sprite debuted its cranberry flavor, which was upgraded to winter-spiced cranberry in 2019. People load up on cans of it every year during the holiday season. The only problem? It’s seasonal, so it’s on shelves for only a few weeks before it’s gone. Last year, customers monitored grocery shelves, waiting for the flavor to be released, and stocked up.Now, the festive soda is back on shelves at retail stores nationwide. The pop supposedly tastes like Sprite’s classic lemon-lime beverage but with a hint of cranberry and warm spices. It comes in two varieties: Sprite Winter Spiced Cranberry and Sprite Winter Spiced Cranberry Zero Sugar. “Sprite fans have always had an affinity for cranberry — a comforting and familiar fruit flavor during the holidays — and the 2019 launch of Sprite Winter Spice Cranberry brought even bigger joy and excitement,” Terika Fasakin, brand director of Sprite North America, said in a press release back in 2022. One creator announced the drop of the Sprite Winter Spice Cranberry, and fans raced to the comments to express their excitement.“I stock up heavy on this every year, ” one shopper wrote. Another person called out, “I liked the OG [the version released in 2013] but this has really grown on me, I’ve started looking forward to it every year.”With the holiday season quickly approaching, you may want to start stocking up on cans and 2-liter bottles of this cranberry Sprite before it runs out, especially if you plan on hosting or showing up as a guest to a bunch of celebrations. It’ll only be available for a limited time, and many shoppers have been anticipating its festive arrival. Buy: 12-Pack Sprite Winter Spiced Cranberry Soda Pop, $12",
