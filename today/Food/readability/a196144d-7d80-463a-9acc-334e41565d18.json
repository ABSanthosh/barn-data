Twenty-nine more are various other whites. There’s only one red wine, a pinot noir from Shelter Winery in the Baden region of Germany.Some may criticize a list like that as self-indulgent, but I love it. I rarely see a wine list with such attitude or character. The wine director, Nikita Malhotra, has nothing against red wines.
