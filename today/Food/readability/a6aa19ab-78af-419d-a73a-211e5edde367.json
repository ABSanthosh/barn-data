And what if I told you’d I’d been making it for years and didn’t tell you about it because I thought, for some bizarre reason, that the site didn’t need another breakfast bun recipe? Yes, I’d throw a jar of cinnamon at my head too. Good news, though, you can stop yelling now because I’ve come to my senses. A few years ago I started veganizing Ree Drummond’s famous cinnamon rolls whenever family or friends were coming over who’d appreciate it. As they’re already egg-free, the remaining swaps were a cinch, but they work equally deliciously with melted butter and dairy milk. Doughs without eggs rise much faster, which came in handy last week when I decided at 10:30pm (when all kid birthday prep is executed) the night before a certain cinnamon swirl-headed kid’s 15th birthday that it would be really nice for him to wake up to freshly baked cinnamon buns, but didn’t want to stay up hours to make them. And that’s the magic here: What started as a special diet recipe has morphed into our house cinnamon rolls because they’re so quick and fuss-free, they seem to implicitly understand a life truth: when you want cinnamon rolls, you want them as soon as humanly possible. Staub x Smitten Kitchen Braiser It’s been six months since I announced that announced that I was partnering with Staub to get them to bring back one of my favorite pans, a squat 4-quart Dutch oven I first bought in 2014 and have since cooked so many things in, it barely leaves my stove. Unfortunately, it sold out in a few hours, and so did the next restock, but we’ve finally got them back in the warehouse and I hope you get a chance to snag one — or nudge a friend or family member about the perfect holiday gift for you. You can order yours here. I hope you love it as much as I love mine. Podcast! A new episode of my podcast with J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, The Recipe with Kenji and Deb, is out and I had so much fun getting ready for the Caesar salad episode. We’re going to learn so much! You can listen to it anywhere you get your podcasts and catch up on any episodes you’ve missed right here. New episodes drop every other Monday. I hope you enjoy listening as much as we’re enjoying the conversation. Video Easiest Cinnamon Rolls These aren’t quite a match for Drummond’s rolls — my measurements are a little different, there’s no baking powder or baking soda, they’re a little less sweet, and I’ve tested this with different yeasts and nondairy products. (I just wanted to warn in case you’re loyal to the world-famous recipe.) Dough2 cups (475 ml) milk, dairy or non-dairy (i.e. oat, almond, soy, etc.), warmed1/2 cup (115 grams) butter, dairy or non-dairy (i.e. margarine), melted and warm1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated sugar1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt1 packet or 2.25 teaspoons (7 grams) active dry or instant yeast5 cups (650 grams) all-purpose flour, divided Filling1/2 cup (115 grams) butter, dairy or non-dairy (i.e. margarine), softened3/4 cup (160 grams) dark brown sugar2 tablespoons (15 grams) ground cinnamon Glaze1 8-ounce (225-gram) block cream cheese or 1 8-ounce tub non-dairy cream cheese, at room temperature1 cup (120 grams) powdered sugar1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract or 1/4 teaspoon vanilla bean paste Make dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the milk, butter, sugar, and salt. Whisk in yeast and let it rest for one minute before continuing. Add 4 1/2 cups (585 grams) of the flour and mix with a spoon or dough whisk (I have this one) until all flour is moistened. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set in a warmish spot to rise for 1 hour, or until doubled. While dough rises, get everything else ready: Cut butter or margarine into cubes and place on a plate so it’s softened by the time the dough has risen. Combine dark brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl and set aside. Prepare your baking pan(s), either one 9×13-inch pan, 2 9-inch round cake pans, or 2 8-inch square cake pans by coating the sides and corners with butter or nonstick spray. Line the bottom of each pan with a piece of parchment. Assemble rolls: Once dough has doubled, stir in remaining 1/2 cup (65 grams) flour and turn dough out onto a well-floured counter. Flour the top of the dough and roll into a large rectangle, about 20 inches wide (the side in front of you) and as deep as you can comfortably stretch it, keeping it about 1/2-inch thick. Spread dough with softened butter. Sprinkle evenly with brown sugar mixture. Roll the dough away from you into a tight coil. I find that the dough always stretches longer as I roll it but if yours hasn’t, you can gently stretch it closer to a 24″ log. Cut log into 12 or 16 even segments. 12 will make classic, generously-sized buns, as shown here. 16 will make more of a muffin-sized bun, and for some reason, smaller pans always look better to me with 8 buns in each. If you’re baking the buns now: Let buns rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to finish proofing. Heat oven to 350°F. If you’re baking the buns tomorrow morning: Lightly coat a piece (or pieces) of plastic with nonstick spray, cover your pan(s), and transfer them to the fridge to chill overnight. You can bake them directly from the fridge in the morning. Bake the buns: For 25 minutes, or until golden at edges and a toothpick inserted into the center of a few buns will come out with cinnamon goo on it, but not stretchy, uncooked dough. While the buns bake, make your glaze: In a large bowl, whisk together the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla until smooth. Finish and eat: When buns come out of the oven, cool on a rack for 5 minutes, then spoon cream cheese glaze on each. Eat right away, which I hope nobody was waiting for my permission to do.
