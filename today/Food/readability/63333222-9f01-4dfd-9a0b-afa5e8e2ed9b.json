I go through the condiment at what some would consider to be an alarming rate, so I started to wonder if it would be more economical for me to make my own. Turns out, all you need to do is soak mustard seeds in a liquid (water, wine, or beer will do), add a little salt, vinegar, and blend! Once the mixture sits for a few days, it’s ready to go. Easy, right? I think part of the reason I’ve never thought to make my own before is that those whole mustard seeds in your pantry don’t seem to smell or taste much like the final product at all. It’s hard to imagine how these little unassuming seeds become the spicy, bracingly acidic condiment that we know and love. It feels like magic. But it’s not magic, of course, it’s science. All you need to make it is whole mustard seeds and water. Using a more flavorful liquid, like wine or beer, also works, but they’re not necessary. The fundamental chemical reaction that makes mustard taste spicy occurs between the seeds and a liquid. Mustard seeds contain glucosinolates. These are pungent, sulphurous compounds that serve as a defense mechanism for the plant to protect from pests. Humans, however, remain undeterred. In fact, as evidenced by the popularity of capsaicin-producing chili peppers, we love this kind of thing. These glucosinolates are relatively inert until you soak and grind them up. This process releases enzymes, creating that spicy flavor. Voila! Why am I getting so science-y? Because understanding the basic process can help you make some adjustments based on how you want your preferences. For instance, soaking the seeds in cold water will create more enzymatic activity, resulting in a spicier mustard. Using warm water, or choosing to let the mustard seeds soak for up to two days will result in less enzymatic activity and a more mellow mustard. The flavors produced by this reaction also develop and change over time, which is why it is often a good idea to let the blended mustard mature in flavor for days or even weeks. Luckily, if you like a pretty hot whole grain mustard that is delightfully bright and acidic, I’ve made some of these adjustments for you in my homemade Champagne Mustard recipe. You might find you like it better than your beloved electric yellow squeeze bottle. What’s your favorite condiment to make at home? Let me know in the comments!
