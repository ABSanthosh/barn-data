All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.The next time you take a trip to your pantry or snack cabinet, you might want to double check what you grab. A few months ago, Riverside Natural Foods Inc. voluntarily recalled “certain batches” of MadeGood Granola Bars over concerns that these products may contain metal shards. Now, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has upgraded this alert to a higher risk level. On February 11, 2025, the FDA heightened the recall for MadeGood Granola Bars to a class II level. This classification means that consuming these products could lead to “temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences,” as explained by the FDA. At the time of the Riverside Natural Foods’ voluntary recall on December 9, 2024, the announcement shared on the FDA website stated that no injuries were reported at that time and that the recall of 2,408,883 cases of MadeGood Granola Bars was a “precautionary measure.” It’s unclear why the FDA reclassified the recall last week, but it’s a good reminder to check your cupboards for any affected products.Which MadeGood granola bars were recalled?You’ll want to check your kitchen to make sure you aren’t harboring any potentially tainted granola bars. The MadeGood products to look out for were made between January 2024 and November 2024 and distributed throughout the U.S., Canada, and other countries. The labels listed below are the ones you’ll want to look for. Chocolate Banana Granola Bars Chocolate Chip Granola Bars Chocolate Drizzled Birthday Cake Granola Bars Chocolate Drizzled Cookie Crumble Granola Bars Chocolate Drizzled Granola Bars Variety Pack Chocolate Drizzled Vanilla Granola Bars Chocolate Mini Chip Granola Bars Cookies \u0026 Creme Granola Bars Halloween Chocolate Chip Granola Mini Bars Holiday Sprinkles Chocolate Drizzled Granola Mini Bars MadeGood Variety Pack Mixed Berry Granola Bars Strawberry Granola Bars For a complete list of products, UPC codes, sizes, and best by dates, visit this link for more information. According to Riverside Natural Foods’ December 9 statement, the company “conducted an extensive investigation where the recalled products were manufactured.” As a result, they “identified the source of an isolated issue in the manufacturing process that has been corrected.” Riverside Natural Foods also worked with retailers to get the affected products off store shelves, but if you need to double check your granola bar purchase, you can consult the products above and in the full recall link.What are the possible symptoms of ingesting metal fragments?Again, Riverside Natural Foods stated in December that the company had not received any reports of injury associated with this alert. Still, you’ll want to be well-versed in the symptoms that come along with accidentally ingesting metal. The most common side effects are dental damage, laceration of the mouth or throat, or perforation of the intestine, reports the FDA. If you think you may have accidentally eaten this product, contact your doctor immediately.What should you do if you have these recalled MadeGood granola bars?If you find these recalled MadeGood granola bars in your home, toss them in the trash or return them to the store for a full refund. Don’t try to dissect them to remove any metal and then eat them. The risks are not worth it. If you have further questions about this alert, you can reach the company at 855-215-5695 between 8 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. ET.",
