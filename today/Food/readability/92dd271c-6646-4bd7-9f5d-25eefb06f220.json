I do have a book of the month membership – I love it so much. That’s where I got a few books from this month. I get so many of my new releases and debut author books there. You can sign up for one here. Most of these books are linked through bookshop (if available!) and I highly suggest shopping through there because it will support your local indie bookstore. You can choose the local bookstore to support! I support Penguin Books when I buy which is my fave here in Pittsburgh. Let me know what you’re reading below! WHAT I READ IN SEPTEMBER 2024 The Housemaid’s Secret – 3.5 stars I started the Housemaid series last month so I had to continue. These books are such fast reads and very twisty – and I love that they don’t really involve kids when it comes to the thriller part. We follow the same character as the first book but it’s years later. She’s trying to stay away from her old life but gets roped back into her ways and wow – the way this one ends is crazy! It’s definitely my second favorite (after book #1). The Housemaid is Watching 3.5 stars This one was my least favorite, but still good. In this book, we jump ahead many years (it was a little jarring!) to when Millie moves into a suburban area from the city. Drama ensues with the neighbors. I didn’t care for these characters or this storyline so much, and the kid parts made me cringe a bit, but it was still really twisty and good. Another very quick read where you don’t know what is going to happen! The Wedding People – 5 stars Easily my best read of the month and possibly, year! This book was SO good and lived up to all the hype. It has a heavier start, when Phoebe checks into a hotel to end her own life. What transpire is crazy – she is the only one at the hotel who ISN’T there for the wedding. The characters in this are incredible. They are all so likeable and loveable even when they aren’t perfect. It is such a wonderful story. I cannot recommend it enough! The Pumpkin Spice Cafe – 3 stars This was very cute and gilmore girls-ish. In this book, we follow Jeanie who moves to a small town (very much like stars hollow) when she inherits her aunt’s coffee shop. The characters in the town were great. I loved the town feel and it’s definitely a good fall book. I didn’t get a ton of chemistry with her and the love interest and it felt a bit young adult/juvenile to me. Still cute though. Another fast easy read. Rock Bottom Girl – 3 stars This also came after The Wedding People. It was a quick and easy light read, but the story fell flat for me. I didn’t love the whole teacher storyline even though the ending does end up being fun/cute/slightly heartwarming. We follow Marley who ends up as a gym teacher and soccer coach after her life all but falls apart. She is reacquainted with a high school love interest (and some frenemies) and we go from there. I thought the best part of the whole book was Libby!! Fall Into Temptation – 3.5 stars Another one that came after The Wedding People and just couldn’t live up to the hype! I liked the one more than the above though. We follow Gianna and Beckett who shouldn’t end up together but have crazy chemistry. Another one with really cute characters and I did like the storyline more than I thought. End is cute too! One Star Romance – 4 stars Got this in my book of the month box! I really really liked it. We meet Natalie and Rob, the friends of a couple getting married. They have a very rocky start and hope to never see each other again, but continue to bump into each other because of these friends. It’s VERY cute and sort of harry met sally-ish. Love the ending, it’s super heartwarming and really wonderful. (This is not sponsored but there are a few bookshop and/or affiliate links above! Thank you for reading!)",
