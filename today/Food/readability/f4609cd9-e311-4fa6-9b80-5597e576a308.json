With that in mind, we've rounded up some of our favorite recipes for this year’s holiday spread, including our best garlic mashed potatoes and a variety of ways to roast sweet potatoes. So whether you're looking for a casserole to feed a crowd or something a bit more elaborate, like a hazelnut hasselback gratin, this list has something for everyone at the table. And yet another reason why potatoes are the best: Most of these recipes are make-ahead friendly, and all of them can be easily adjusted to fit your guest list. If you're looking for even more last minute Thanksgiving inspiration, check out our roundups of the best Thanksgiving side dishes and appetizers you can start cooking right now. 1. The Best Sweet Potato Casserole Edna Lewis \u0026 Scott Peacock's sweet potato casserole swaps marshmallows for sugar-crusted pecans, and it’s all the better for it. The base layer is equally delicious, featuring whipped, buttery sweet potatoes and a touch of cinnamon, nutmeg, and honey. 2. Baked Sweet Potatoes with Maple Crème Fraîche It couldn’t be easier: Roast sweet potatoes at a high heat until they’re almost caramelized, then toss them in a tangy maple crème fraîche dressing that perfectly balances the sweetness. For garnish, there are plenty of options between chile flakes, lime zest, roasted peanuts, and scallions. 3. Mashed Maple Chipotle Sweet Potatoes While you might not usually think to pair chile with potatoes for Thanksgiving, trust us: it works. These mashed sweet potatoes strike the perfect balance of smoky chipotle and sweet maple for a dish that’s both comforting and full of unexpected flavor. 4. Goguma Mattang (Candied Sweet Potatoes) Not as sweet as caramel apples, but just as amazing. These golden bites are crispy, candied perfection, coated in a glossy sugar syrup that adds just the right amount of sweetness. While they have a dessert-like flavor, they’re still a great side for dinner and a nice contrast to other savory dishes. 5. Sweet Potato Bake This sweet potato bake is simple but full of flavor, thanks to brown sugar and warm spices. Most of the prep time is spent waiting for the sweet potatoes to boil until tender, leaving you free time to tackle other dishes or set the table. 6. Orange Cardamom Roasted Sweet Potatoes If you’re looking for something a bit more elevated, but still traditional enough that everyone will eat , these sweet potatoes are a great choice. The addition of orange and cardamom gives them a sophisticated touch, making them a great match for the other fall flavors on your table. 7. Scalloped Potatoes with Caramelized Onions Layers of creamy potatoes and sweet caramelized onions make this the ultimate potato casserole—just look at the photo! It’s the kind of side that everyone will fight over, and you’ll be left wishing there were more of the next day. 8. Hazelnut Hasselback Potato Gratin This hazelnut hasselback gratin from cookbook author Hetty Lui McKinnon is worth all the slicing, arranging, and garnishing it requires—and trust us, you’ll want to do each part. And if you’re feeling like going the extra mile, she includes the recipe for her homemade hazelnut cream that infuses the potatoes with the richest, nuttiest flavor. 9. Pre-Seasoned Mashed Potatoes The secret to these mashed potatoes lies within seasoning the cooking water. Instead of simply salting your potatoes after, try adding a bundle of crushed garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns to the water as it boils. The herbs and seasonings infuse the potatoes with all the flavor, leaving just the mashing and the addition of butter and cream to bring it all together. 10. Scalloped Potato Stacks If every other baking dish is in use, don’t worry—these potatoes are made in a muffin tin. These scalloped potato stacks get coated in a rosemary parmesan batter that all comes together in a food processor, which also means less dishes. 11. Mashed Potatoes with Caramelized Onions \u0026 Goat Cheese These potatoes are fluffy, creamy, and threaded with caramelized onions, goat cheese, and sage. Another great recipe if you want to elevate your dish without putting in too much extra time. Get maximum flavor by infusing the half and half with sage and bay leaves beforehand, and using a potato ricer instead of a traditional masher. 12. Carrot and Potato Gratin Almost like a potato ratatouille, this dish looks far more time-intensive than it actually is—it’s all about the arrangement. Alternating carrots and white potatoes creates a festive color pattern that presents great on a Thanksgiving table, especially in a cast iron. 13. Potato Gateau The best part of this dish is that it can be fully made and cooked ahead of time, and then simply reheated before serving—without compromising on quality. Layer buttery mashed potatoes layered with a blend of your favorite cheeses, prosciutto, and bread crumbs. It’s a bit heartier than your average side, but still light enough to enjoy alongside everything else on the table. 14. Potatoes à la Lyonnaise Author Mimi Thorisson describes this dish as the ‘little black dress’ of side dishes, and we get why. It’s simple, crowd-pleasing, and chances are you already have all the ingredients— everything you could want in a Thanksgiving side. We want to know: What is your favorite way to cook potatoes?",
