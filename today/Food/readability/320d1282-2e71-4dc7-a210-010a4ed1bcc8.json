  "description": "I LOVE LISTS I bought delicata squash for this salad. We all need fart walks. Galaxies are gorgeous. There’s so much of the world I haven’t seen. This mushroom color atlas is wild. How to motivate to clean. I want a garden labratory. Visit where Stand By Me was filmed. I wonder what it’s like driving this thing. Why do we knock on wood? Some apple picking tips. This honey ice cream looks good! I forgot how much I love black \u0026 white photography. This hummingbird is living the life. How cute is this disco pumpkin? This sweater looks cozy. Old photo charm! These ladies are amazing. Autumn things coming to Trader Joe’s. If you need Autumn recipes, I got you! Why Costco never labels their aisles. I shared my favorite photo of my parents on Keep Grief Weird substack! The post I LOVE LISTS appeared first on Shutterbean.",

The cutest thing I’ve ever seen was a hummingbird sitting on top of our 8 foot fence, taking a bath in that sprinkler water. Okay, maybe not quite as cute as this hummingbird, but darn close! Reply",
