For example: When does it open? What can you eat there, and how much does it cost? These are just the sort of details that appear on a restaurant’s website, traditionally a digital repository of facts about your prospective meal.Unless they don’t. Lately, a number of establishments — not under-the-radar mom-and-pops, but chic or pedigreed restaurants, the kind of places that appear on must-try lists — are withholding the details in favor of an air of mystery.If you are willing to click past the warning that your connection is not private, the website for Warlord, a buzzy Chicago restaurant known for its long lines and defiant lack of P.R., offers only a black homepage promising “a relaxed dining experience in the Avondale neighborhood of Chicago focused on preservation and live fire; from the foundations of family and friendship.” There are hours and an address, but no indication of what might be cooking on the fire.The landing page for Frog Club, in New York City, which only recently allowed photographs to be taken in the dining room, offers no information other than a link to Resy, a “contact” button and a large image of an aggressively closed door. Saigon Babylon, in Cambridge, Mass., has no website at all, but does maintain an Instagram account. Currently it has nine posts, none of which feature food.ImageSince Frog Club opened in New York City in February, the owners have tried to maintain an air of secrecy, though the restaurant recently began allowing patrons to take photos inside.Credit...Colin Clark for The New York TimesIf you are trying to plan your evening and would like to know if there is a vegan option or how much the hamburger might cost, the low-information restaurant can be infuriating.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
