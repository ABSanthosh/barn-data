All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Deutschlandreform/ShutterstockLet’s be real: Getting ready for the holidays can be just as stressful as it is joyful. As you squeeze in holiday shopping between work and Netflix marathons, deck out your space with TikTok-approved decor, and channel your inner Martha Stewart before hosting, finding a festive little treat can help you get through the toughest moments. Luckily, advent calendars are one of the best holiday hacks for extending the holiday cheer for as long as possible — and Aldi is rolling out adorable mini iterations for everyone in your life, from the selective cheese connoisseur to the devoted pet parent. Starting at just $1.29, Aldi’s advent calendars are a steal for everyone on your list — and an excuse to stock up on a few for yourself. The Aldi Finds section has 22 options on deck this week — and to be totally honest, the wine advent calendars were the first to catch my eye.There’s a general one with 24 (187-milliliter) bottles featuring reds, whites, and rosés, as well as a 5 Days of Cabernet Sauvignon calendar and a 5 Days of Red Wines Calendar. Other boozy options include a Make It Sparkle variety pack of sparkling wines, a 12 Days of Wicked Grove Hard Cider, and Connellys 12 Days of Irish Cream. Prices on these alcohol advent calendars depend on the store and location, so you’ll need to head to your closest Aldi or call ahead to find out how much they are.Foodies will also want to get in on the advent calendar fun, as Aldi is also selling a Barissimo Coffee calendar for $13.99 with 24 cups of 100% Arabica grounds, as well as Burman’s 25 Days of Holiday Heat hot sauce for $14.99. Meanwhile, the 24-day Choceur Chocolate calendars promise to keep your sweet tooth at bay for just $1.29, or there’s a $14.99 luxury chocolate version from Moser Roth. There’s also a $7.99 chocolate truffle version from Choceur and a $16.99 cheese option from Emporium Selection that’s a “Cheese Village” with 24 mini samples. Aldi’s non-food advent calendars are also bringing great value, including a $29.99 Huntington Home Candle Advent Calendar that includes 25 candles — an even better deal than Trader Joe’s 12 Days of Scented Candles for the same price. Lastly, fur parents can give their pups 25 days of treats with the $7.99 Pure Being Dog Advent Calendar, which has no artificial ingredients, colors, or preservatives.These are just a few of Aldi’s most noteworthy advent calendars this year, but you’ll need to head to your closest location to see what’s in stock — and potentially scoop up some of these finds for yourself. After all, what better way to commit to the holiday countdown than by making a ritual out of opening one of these slots a day? Even if you don’t partake every single day (personally, I prefer saving all the chocolates from the week and then eating them in one sitting), it’s still a fun activity to look forward to. This post originally appeared on Apartment Therapy.
