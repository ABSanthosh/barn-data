You would think that it would be easy to do after the holidays and its seemingly endless parties have come to a close. However, most of the time, I find myself somehow attending more get-togethers in January. (I think it’s because I spent most of December holed up in my parents’ house.) I’ve already gone to a birthday party, concert, and a ballet in the last couple of weeks alone. And I just love sipping on a cute cocktail, okay?So, yeah, the drinks were definitely flowing this past month, and unsurprisingly, I wasn’t feeling all that great afterward. I’m determined to cut back in February — even though I have three Valentine’s Day parties coming up. My latest find is going to hold me to my goal: Little Saints’ mushroom-based, sugar-free mocktails. It satisfies that craving for a cocktail with none of the negative side effects, and everything from its bottled spirits to its canned drinks are totally delicious. What Is Little Saints?Megan Klein, the founder of Little Saints, set out to solve a problem she faced during the pandemic: She loved cocktails but hated hangovers. “My socializing always went hand in hand with drinking, and it wasn’t until the pandemic that I realized the damage that booze was doing to my mental and physical health,” she says on Little Saints website. She tried Dry January a few years ago, but wasn’t impressed by the non-alcoholic options out there that were filled with sugar and didn’t really provide the smell and feeling of a true cocktail.After noticing that gap in the market, Little Saints was born. Klein enlisted a food scientist to help develop its nonalcoholic beverages, which use no sugar and incorporate mushrooms as mentioned. Its offerings that I tested include a flask gift box set, which include two bottles of its St. Ember and St. Juniper spirits. The former is mezcal-like, made up of lion’s mane mushrooms and palo santo, and the latter is gin-like, made up of lion’s mane and damiana flower. You can buy both as full bottles, too.Those work as nonalcoholic bases in mixed drinks, while the canned versions are ready to drink right away. The variety pack that I love includes a faux ginger mule, paloma, spicy margarita, and negroni spritz. Each one consists of a blend of organic reishi mushroom and aromatic terpenes.Why I Love the Mini Bar Kit and Nonalcoholic Cocktail Variety PackWith overwhelmingly positive reviews calling Little Saints’ offerings “very light,” “so refreshing,” and “a delicious replacement,” I had high expectations going in, and I wasn’t disappointed as soon as I cracked open the mini bottles and cans. In the case of every single one, I would think I was drinking an actual cocktail if I wasn’t already aware beforehand. However, it does lack some of the unpleasant sharpness that comes with hard liquors. It’s noticeably brighter and more herbal, keeping you from the icky aftereffects of regular alcohol. Out of the two faux spirits, the gin-alternative Juniper was my favorite — though Ember will be a hit if you’re a fan of smoky drinks. My alcohol-free friend, who loves drinks with mezcal, was thoroughly impressed by Ember when I brought it to her party. The flask was so easy to toss in my purse, too, thanks to its size! But back to Juniper: I decided to follow a post on Little Saints’ Instagram, which explained how to mimic a gin and tonic with the nonalcoholic spirit with two ingredients (Juniper and tonic water). I made a real one and sipped them side by side to compare, and I could only detect a minimal difference.Out of all the fizzy canned drinks, which are decently sized, the ginger mule completely blew me away. Moscow mules are one of my go-to drinks at the bar, and if you poured it into a glass and handed it to me, I wouldn’t think twice and doubt it was a real one. That and all of the other flavors are something I can see myself stocking up in my fridge on the regular as an alternative to cocktails, seltzers, and soda. They’d also be great for mixing if you aren’t trying to cut back on booze completely. Speaking for myself, I’m definitely planning on ordering more Little Saints to bring to all my upcoming parties!Buy: Mini Bar Kit, $39.99Buy: Non-Alcoholic Cocktail Variety Pack (12-Pack), $59.99My Kitchn HelperGet our favorite editor-tested and -approved finds sent twice a week to your inbox.",
