  "text": "Hello friends! Whew, I never thought how grateful I would be to write the words “hello friends” again. It’s been a whirlwind few months for me, so much so that I’m going to bullet point the highlights/lowlights. First off, I moved to a cute little apartment in Lincoln Square!… because Bre and I are no longer together. Breakups and moving are in a category all their own, and I don’t recommend them together, but I’m still here, so that’s a win. I have a new kitty (and still have Wylie)! Her name is Junie B. Jones and I slightly regret naming her that, since she really has some Caillou-like tendencies. Some cruel person dropped her out of a car window onto the street and was rescued. She is truly a toddler, has shredded my monstera plant within an inch of its life, and bullies me for food to the point that I have to eat with a spray bottle nearby. And I am obsessed with her. My brother got married in Jalisco, Mexico at the beginning of May. There was a 30 person all-woman mariachi band at their wedding reception and that will forever live in my memory. While in Mexico, my aunt, my mother’s sister, unexpectedly fell ill and passed away. May her memory forever be a blessing. I saw Beyoncé in Houston at her show when her suspended-in-air car tipped wayyy to the side. Insane! And, AND! I got to see Joy! Really, it’s been too long, and next time I’m bringing a bigger suitcase and several swimsuits. Road tripped to Nashville with some friends over 4th of July weekend, and stopped at Buc-ee’s twice. Did I buy the Buc-ee’s swimsuit? Yes. Do I have any regrets? Only that I didn’t buy two. Also don’t sleep on the bean, potato, and cheese burritos!! Is that enough stuff? I think I’ve caught you up appropriately. Between my life and the state of everything, I am often overwhelmed to the point of panic. Financially, I get paid on Friday and am overdraft by Monday because of bills. I am learning to lean on my circle of support, and they continue to show up for me in ways I never thought possible. I am so grateful for the people in my life, including y’all. I missed you so much! I’m not crying, you are! One lesson I am continually learning is: forward is forward, movement is movement. Crying is fine, sadness is warranted, but it won’t be like this forever. This is from me to me; Abby, it won’t be like this forever. Internally, I am choosing to believe that because things have been so difficult, something incredible is on the other side of this. Let’s get into this Sunday! • I do not have words for the devastation, flooding, and disasters in Texas, but here are some ways you can help. The Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country has boots on the ground relief and a flood relief fund. Kerrville Folk Festival has opened their grounds for refuge to anyone that needs it. Joy also has donated to Global Empowerment Mission that is also active in relief and rebuilding. In these times, I’m extra grateful for community. • One of my favorite artists, Maggie Rogers, casually discovered by Pharrell at NYU gave the commencement address at NYU’s Arts graduation. “When you love something so much, it can be terrifying to give it your all… Art is not an industry or a game; it’s a practice.” The Truth About Dreams (Spotify, NYT Gift Link) • I’ve decided to live out my 90’s dream clothing scenarios this summer. It’s Docs sandals, skater dresses, and denim on denim on denim all day. All DAY, son. (Nordstrom Rack, ASOS, YouTube) • What is the Slave to the Fourth of July? – by Frederick Douglass, as read by his direct descendants, hits you differently. (Instagram) • Social media is a beast isn’t it? Having been around at the very beginning of every form of social media, from Facebook to TikTok, its transformation has been weird to experience and watch. So many of my friends are forsaking social media because of its inherent toxicity. The influence it has is long lasting, and tends to prey upon the vulnerable, leading you to believe what you see online is the truth and the only truth. I miss the days of sharing a blurry photo of food and it being so exciting, instead of finding Chicago’s newest hidden gem and it being the newest Barnes \u0026 Noble in Wicker Park. That feeling you have when you see something posted on socials? That blasé, passive, ugh/cringe-type feeling – it’s called “ennui.” In the era of the never-ending scroll, it’s seemingly seeped into everything.  (New Yorker Mag) • A bit of shared joy – you know I love Taryn Delanie Smith, former Miss New York, best friend in my head. She recently bought an old house in upstate New York, and is documenting her journey. It’s heartwarming, hilarious, and somehow makes your chest ache beautifully. (Instagram) • Tell me, when you go through really hard times, is feeding yourself super difficult? I am having a bit of trouble remembering to eat at night since my breakup, my appetite moving out when I moved out of my old apartment. Trust that I am working with my therapist and doctors to make sure I’m okay, but being a human that functions is rough! I stumbled upon an old recipe of Joy’s that has been helpful, the Spring Roll in a Bowl. It’s fresh and bright, there’s a nice mix of textures, and peanut sauce, which will never lead you wrong. (Joy the Baker) • I would never think to recommend this but having stayed there, the Margaritaville Hotel in Nashville was truly a vacation experience. Now the restaurant? Can burn down. But the hotel was a dream! Would you ever stay there? Nashville hosts the largest fireworks display in the country (though, that is according to Nashville). My friends and I watched the show from the top of a parking garage, Trolley Barns to be exact. It was perfect, away from the crowds, and felt quintessentially Nashville-esque. • Dawn, a coffee shop in Nashville, had coconut cold foam on hand, and now it’s all I think about. This recipe seems simple enough to make every morning, casually. What I really want to know is how to make the croissant like donuts from Five Daughters. Friends, if you need to talk about an immaculate pastry at length, please hit me up. (How Sweet Eats) • You know? Some days, my best is just some. And then we nap, amen? (Instagram) • In this episode of “Man, TikTok got me again!” here are these  I am absolutely obsessed with these pens. The writing is smoother than smooth, and it has a little roller ball on the pen clip and it makes for an incredible tiny fidget spinner. (Amazon) • Catch me outside with these Palomas in a glass bottle of Squirt all summer long or these Lavender Lemon Drop Martinis with my pinkie up. Just need to find a kiddie pool to fill with ice. (Instagram, Joy the Baker) • This just to say, I bought the Tomato Leaf candle that Amy recommended last week from Merz Apothecary down the street from my apartment. I’ve never felt closer to Ina Garten in my life. Amy is never wrong! (KOBO, Substack) 6 Responses First… you are right, it won’t be like this forever. It’s a great reminder. Also, last time I had my heart broken, it was 100% awful, but also 100% closed the door on something that definitely need to end, and cleared space for something SO MUCH better in my life. I am praying the same for you. Looking back, I am intensely grateful for that closed door– even as I remember hiding in a closet at work, crying and thinking “I don’t know how to get through this.” You can, and you will. Second- when I have trouble feeding myself, I lean on “snack plates”- whatever little things feel delicious and easy in the moment (a few raw veggies and hummus, a few pieces of fruit, some nuts, a hardboiled egg, maybe even a bread of toast and cheese). Sending you positive vibes. Woo-eee, Amy, that is A LOT you’re going through. Please schedule plenty of time for naps. Ohhhhh thinking of you, Abby! And glad to see you back. :) I’ve had my heart broken an impressive amount of times, and every time I think, “I can’t survive this another time. It’s just going to stay shattered this time.” And then I’m okay. Happy even! It’s incredible the way we can keep moving forward. :) Thinking good thoughts for you, Abby! So cliche, but this will pass and life will get back to a good normal – wishing you peace and comfort until it does. Love your posts, love Lincoln Square (I grew up there, my mom is still there), and I love Merz Apothecary so, so much. Wishing you all the best in this changed period of your life. I love your newsletters! I’m holding space for you and yes, it will not always be like this. You will look back on this time and think, “look at how I got through that!” And as my mom always says, “things will feel better in the morning”. I’m also dying laughing at the idea of sitting at the table with a spray bottle while you eat being bullied by your car Junie B Jones! Thanks for that laugh!
