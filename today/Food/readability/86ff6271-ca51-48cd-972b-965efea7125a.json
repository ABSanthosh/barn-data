  "text": "Last summer, when my younger child joined my older child at sleepaway camp for a month for the first time, leaving us unmoored and a little restless, we made a list of restaurants we’d been meaning to try and friends we don’t see enough and took this task on like it was our job. I barely cooked once. By the end of the third week, everything hurt and we realized our template for a child-free life (going out late, cocktails on weeknights, and generally behaving despicably) was based on our age and energy level when we were last child-free, which (I’m sorry as this fact seems to upset you guys as much as it does his actual parents) was almost 15 years ago. This year, I vowed to cook at home at least a little more for the sake of our general vitality. Plus, since it’s as hot as the surface of the sun and as humid as a swamp in NYC this July, eating decadent meals and fizzy drinks has lost, well, at least 10% of its usual luster. But what do you cook when you don’t have your little Statler and Waldorf heckling you at the table with cantankerous opinions on what you have had the audacity to present them for dinner? Chickpeas, it turns out, and lots of zucchini. And we can’t get enough of this one. Here, the chickpeas are braised in some broth and olive oil, with layers of onion, garlic, and thinly-sliced zucchini/summer squash, salt, and pepper flakes on top. For the first 15 minutes, we simmer it with the lid on, to soften the vegetables. For the next 30 minutes, we have the lid off but we only stir it 15 minutes before the end. At the 30 minute mark, the chickpeas are… nice! good, tasty. At 45 minutes, however, they’re heavenly, plump with all of the flavors in the pan and ready to collapse. To finish it, we stir in basil pesto, nestle torn chunks of burrata throughout, and scatter parmesan or pecorino over the top. Scoop this onto grilled hearty bread and revel, I mean, absolutely revel in the deliciousness before you. Staub x Smitten Kitchen Braiser This pan, this braiser, the object of my decade-long cookware obsession, is finally back in stock! This spring, I announced that I was partnering with Staub to get them to bring back one of my favorite pans, this squat 4-quart Dutch oven I first bought in 2014 and have since cooked so many things in, it barely leaves my stove (you can see it here too!). Unfortunately, it sold out quickly twice but it’s back in stock again and I hope this means if you missed it in the spring, you get a chance to snag one now. You can watch a forge/factory tour I took last fall in France here. And you can order your own braiser here. Video Braised Chickpeas with Zucchini and Pesto 2 15-ounce cans of chickpeas, drained and rinsed1 1/2 to 2 cups vegetable broth4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced1 large yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt1 pound summer squash or zucchini, quartered lengthwise, thinly sliced1/4 cup olive oil1/4 cup prepared or storebought basil pesto8 ounces of burrata or 1 cup fresh ricottaGrated parmesan cheese, to finishSliced sourdough or country bread, grilled or toasted Place chickpeas and 1 1/2 cups broth in a large braiser or saucepan. Scatter garlic, onion, pepper flakes, salt, and zucchini on top and drizzle olive oil over. No need to stir. Bring the ingredients to a simmer and cover with a lid to cook for 45 minutes total. However, at the 15-minute mark, remove the lid (but still, no need to stir yet). At the 30-minute mark, stir ingredients to evenly combine. If all of the liquid is gone from the pan or the chickpeas are sticking to the bottom, add remaining 1/2 cup broth. Remove pan from heat and stir in pesto in dollops. Make divots for the burrata, using your fingers to tear it into chunks before nudging them into the pan. Finish with some parmesan and extra pepper flakes. Ladle into low bowls and serve with grilled bread. Do ahead: Leftovers keep for 4-5 days in the fridge. If you’re planning ahead, I’d wait to add the finishes (burrata and parmesan) until the chickpeas have reheated. Notes: To keep this gluten-free, you’ll need to use a gluten-free bread for serving. If the layering of onion, garlic, and vegetables sounds a bit like my One-Pan Farro with Tomatoes, it is not accidental. This dish started as a zucchini riff on it, which came out absolutely deliciously but didn’t feel “new” enough to warrant a new recipe on the site. Plus, we loved the chickpea version even more. If you’d like to make it at home, however, simply add the zucchini here instead of the tomatoes in the original recipe and finish it with the pesto, burrata, and parmesan as written here.
