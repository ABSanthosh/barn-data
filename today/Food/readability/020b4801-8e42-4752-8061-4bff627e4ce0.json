After a steep decline (in 2015, NPR declared yogurt the reigning dairy champ), curds and whey has reclaimed its spot as a fridge staple, rising from its 1970s glory days, according to a new article in WSJ. So if it feels like suddenly everyone is spooning cottage cheese on their toasts, blending it with their eggs, or eating it straight, that’s because they are. Even Jennifer Garner is using it on her Pretend Cooking Show. Thanks to a slew of viral Tik Toks and brands like Good Culture, which has nearly doubled its revenue since 2023, the once-hated dairy product has seen an undeniable resurgence. Whether you've been riding the cottage cheese wave all year, or are newly vowing to embrace it, we’ve got plenty of recipes—sweet, savory, and actually delicious—to inspire you. Think beyond scrambled eggs: from strawberry cottage cheese pancakes to tikka masala naan pizzas, these 17 ideas are simple, satisfying, and, because of the cottage cheese, packed with a bit more protein than you might expect, if that’s your thing. If you can’t get past the tang or texture, ease in with some raspberry crescent cookies or chorizo cornbread where you’ll barely notice the taste. Cottage cheese also happens to make a great ricotta swap for those lasagna and stuffed pasta nights. 1. Cottage Cheese Pancakes Not a pancake person? This recipe might change your mind. The cottage cheese adds a creamy, custard-like texture that’s like having strawberry cheesecake for breakfast. 2. Avocado Toast Think of this as a dressed-up open-face sandwich rather than just an avocado toast. It’s especially great with summer-ripe tomatoes, but even off-season, the watercress and lemon zest give it a fresh and flavorful taste all year long. 3. Orange Vegetables with Homemade Cottage Cheese Cottage cheese isn’t just for breakfast—it’s a secret dinner weapon as well. This cozy side dish layers winter squash, sweet potatoes, or yams with dollops of a lemony cottage cheese, all topped with vinegar-honey drizzle. 4. Cottage Cheese \u0026 Chive Rolls Much like the pancakes, these dinner rolls get a boost in texture and cheesy richness from the cottage cheese. Soft, pillowy, and packed with chives, it’s essentially the perfect dinner roll. 5. Noodle Kugel with Caramelized Onions A casserole you will actually want to eat, plus it’s super easy to make and holds up great in the fridge. Most of the prep is spent letting the onions caramelize. After that, the base gets blended up and mixed right into the baking dish. From Our Shop 6. Lentil Salad with Roasted Tomatoes Another way to ease into cottage cheese? Top it on this warm lentil and tomato salad. It adds a nice creaminess and contrast to the garlic and thyme breadcrumb topping. 7. Ham \u0026 Cheese Egg Muffins These ham \u0026 cheese egg muffins are a meal prepper’s dream: easy to make for the week ahead and naturally packed with protein. Plus, they’re a lifesaver for non-morning people who don’t have time to whip up breakfast every day. 8. Spanakopita Spanakopita is way easier to make than you think, especially with store-bought phyllo dough and frozen spinach. A generous amount of eggs and dairy create the creamiest filling for a flaky, surprisingly high-protein appetizer. 9. Roasted Strawberry Cheesecake Smoothie If you’re skeptical about cottage cheese in a smoothie, we get it—but trust us. Once again, strawberry is the perfect flavor to incorporate cottage cheese without it being too overpowering. And when blended, it turns into a smooth, yogurt-like base that works with almost every smoothie. 10. Berry Cottage Cheese Skillet Cake Much like buttermilk or yogurt, the cottage cheese in this berry skillet cake adds a rich flavor and keeps it extra moist. It’s a great weeknight treat, but between the fruit, eggs, and cottage cheese, you could totally call it a breakfast cake, too. 11. Roasted Veggie Lasagna You can easily swap cottage cheese for ricotta in most lasagnas, but this veggie version does it for you. It’s lighter than your typical baked pasta, loaded with onions, mushrooms, zucchini, and plenty of freshly grated parm. 12. Tikka Masala Naan Pizza Shake up your pizza night with this tikka masala twist. The naan makes for an easy prep and avoids any potential yeast mishaps. Just layer on the sauce, red onion, chickpeas, squash, and of course, some dollops of cottage cheese. 13. Crescent Jam \u0026 Cheese Cookies Another baked good that gets a boost from cottage cheese. While the recipe requires whipping up a batch of homemade dough, the ingredient list is simple, and the filling works with any jam you’ve got on hand. 14. Cornbread with Chorizo While you can’t really go wrong with a box mix, this recipe is a great way to level up your cornbread game with spicy chorizo, fresh corn, and a full pint of cottage cheese—so no leftovers in the fridge. 15. Breakfast Casserole with Bacon \u0026 Veggies Another great make-ahead breakfast for busy weeks or a house full of guests. The cottage cheese isn’t super noticeable—it simply stretches the eggs. Plus, it’s an easy way to clean out the fridge and use up any leftover veggies. 16. Hot Clam Dip with a Toasted Almond Crust When you’re looking for a clever way to use up that half-empty pint of cottage cheese you have hanging around, this dip answers the call, and the almond panko breadcrumb topping in this recipe takes it up a notch. 17. Omelet with Whipped Ricotta This omelet calls for either whipped ricotta or cottage cheese, or you could blend both if you’re still not convinced. Top with any kind of tender green, a splash of vinegar, and a drizzle of olive oil for the perfect balance of flavors. What are your thoughts on the cottage cheese trend?
