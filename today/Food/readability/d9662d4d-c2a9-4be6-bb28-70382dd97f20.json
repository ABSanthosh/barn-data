  "description": "There is more to say on this subject, and this will be clunky and too much and not enough but I need to start somewhere, even just for me. I started this blog over 11 years ago as of writing this post, and if I look at my past writing, both the personal parts and how I wrote recipes, I can mark my own growth in both areas. I hope to always stay in motion of learning and listening, even when I disagree, if only so I may better understand my own thoughts and beliefs, and have compassion for all sorts of perspectives. These last few months have woken up so many of us - gosh, I mean that to be interpreted in all sorts of ways. I see how many of our existing systems are still oppressive, even quietly so. I am reading and listening and participating in an Actively Anti-Racist learning group, and understanding more completely that being “nice” has not been enough. I will never understand or have the experience, as a white woman, to speak as an authority on this subject. My privilege has been surrounded by a lot of other privilege, and I have work to do to shift from, as well as within that. I will be the first to admit that up to this point, my advocacy has been quiet and passive, which actually serves nobody. I believe in caring for people and community and inclusion, but the diversity and amplification of black chefs and allyship towards fair farming and food systems has been lacking here. I apologize for ways I have appropriated recipes from other cultures without researching and crediting appropriately first, or have used language that came off as exclusive, as much of the health and wellness themes can give off. What initially felt like drinking from a fire hose, has been met with starting somewhere. We have been going through Brit Barron’s Understanding Racism 101 and if you are looking for a place to start, I would highly recommend her work. My education up to this point has been through podcasts (I loved this recent one from Brene Brown), which is a good base, but gosh there are so many folks to learn from and books to read. I am also currently reading White Fragility, and have I’m Still Here and Between the World and Me in the queue- there are lists all over the interwebs. I bought more books for the kids, such as Sulwe, Little Leaders and Fearless Trailblazers, as we have more experience within the Latino community where we live and there is anti-racist work to be done there as well. I mean none of this to be performative, and gosh, it’s a small start, but I have found these resources because others have shared them with me, so I am putting them here to pass them on.I want complacency to be something I look back on as a point I grew forward from - like the Maya Angelou quote, “once you know better, do better.” I commit to being humble, brave and vulnerable; and in my own self-awareness, be moved towards action to change the conversation. I’m glad you are here and I appreciate educated and compassionate discourse on different subjects. Looking forward to learning and growing and saying the wrong thing sometimes, so that I may learn to do better the next time. To potatoes…because how does one transition well here?The green sauce is one of dozens of sauces we’ve featured over on SKCC. What used to be subscription based, is now open for a la carte purchases, and bundles of favorited recipes based on different themes. You can now purchase bundles for a shot of recipe inspiration without having to commit to a subscription. Make an account on sproutedkitchen.cc and it should be easy to navigate from there. One of the most versatile bundles is the Sauce \u0026 Condiment Bundle, where we’ve been storing favorites that really can be used for so many meals. Pictured here is the Green Herb Sauce, a sister favorite, the Green Harissa, made with lemon instead of lime juice, would also be great. The Green Goddess in that group is also excellent with potatoes, just serve it on the side instead of brushing it all over the top. SMASHED POTATOESServes 4-62 lbs. is generous for 4 people, but moderate for 6, so depends what else you’re serving and what kind of eaters you have. I use baby Yuokns, but fingerlings work as well. They’ll need a few minutes less of a preboil as they are typically smaller. If you are not interested in making a green sauce, brushing them with a little bit of oil and vinegar after baking gives them a little more of a glisten for serving. Potatoes like a post bake bath in a little dressing. Why are we mixing oils? Because the smoke point of olive oil is low, but I prefer it’s flavor to the high-heat oils. So we’re mixing them. Ingredients2 lbs. baby Yukons1 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil2 Tbsp. grapeseed or avocado oil1 1/2 tsp. coarse sea salt1 tsp. paprika1 tsp. garlic powder1 tsp. dried oregano2 oz. grated parmesan cheese1 small bundle Italian parsley, well chopped, for garnishGreen Herb SauceDirectionsPut the potatoes in a pot and cover them with water. Bring the water to a gentle boil and leave them on a gentle boil for about 10-15 minutes, or until you can pierce through a medium sized potato with a paring knife. Drain and cool to the touch - at least 15 minutes.Line a rimmed baking tray with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 425’. Spread the potatoes out and use the bottom of a heavy jar or glass to push down on the potatoes to smash them. Don’t push down all the way, or you’ll over smash them, you want to push about halfway. If you keep busting through them or this step sounds annoying, simply slice the potatoes in halves and quarters for a more tailored looking tot. Drizzle both oils over the tops, along with the salt, paprika, garlic powder, and oregano. Gently toss the potatoes around to get seasoning and oil on all sides. We want them oiled and seasoned liberally! Add more if needed. A bit of breakage is ok. Roast the potatoes for 25 minutes, flipping halfway through. Pull them out, heat up to 500’, sprinkle the parm, and pop them back into the oven for another two minutes just to melt the cheese. While the potatoes roast, make your green sauce. Just out of the oven, brush the green sauce all over the potatoes, and sprinkle fresh herbs. Serve warm.
