  "description": "It used to be easier to write here. I like imagining who I am writing to and I’ve lost some of that here. I thought Instagram was a more effective place to share, but that place changed for me, as well. So, I want to be back here like I used to be. Every week if I can, which may be lofty, but I’m going to try. Writing about life or nothing, and sharing something that I made with you all. Perhaps not always a meal, even just a dressing we liked or something from a cookbook I’m enjoying. Would love to engage with you all. I just feel like there are almost too many ways now, and I need to keep shifting to find what fits. Anyway. Hi. Speaking of you and me and connecting. I am doing a short-ish Zoom demo/class with my Cooking Club folks on Sunday morning at 9am PST. Admittance will be the recipe of a donation to Cajun Navy Relief, or any non-profit involved in the relief efforts in New Orleans. Please email or DM a receipt by Saturday. I would love to have any of you non-members along as well. We’re making some kid-friendly things - zucchini and bean taquitos with some avocado dressing to dip and maybe a nectarine crumble crisp if there is enough time. Quinoa \u0026 Sweet Potato Saladw/ Turmeric Tahini DressingServes 2The recipe is tinkered from the Many’s Gourmet Salads cookbook which has some truly excellent ideas for fellow salad lovers. It can take add ins, a swap of olives in for the feta to keep it dairy free, but by all means, double the dressing. It works as a dip and dressing for all sort of things. Have to laugh at home many meals on this site include sweet potatoes and quinoa BUT! Here we are, and it’s so good. You can cook quinoa and lentils together with 2:1 water to lentil and quinoa ratio. Bring to a simmer, turn down the heat and cook with the cover ajar for about 20 minutes. Fluff with a fork and set aside to cool. This does require a wee bit of prep, so if you are a salad person, I suggest doubling it and having the components on hand to make this salad a few times throughout the week. Everything saves well. I’ve added grilled chicken or salmon or toss extra firm squares of tofu in oil and coconut aminos and roasting it at a high heat until golden, about 20 minutes, for a veg friendly topping. However, it doesn’t need any of these add-ins, it is plenty satisfying as is!Recipe adapted from Mandy’s Salads Ingredients1 large sweet potato - peeled \u0026 diced1 Tbsp. of avocado oilsea saltfresh ground pepper4 cups of spring mix2 cups of baby kale1/2 cup of cooked quinoa1/2 cup of cooked \u0026 drained lentils2 cups of diced cucumbers1 cup of cherry tomatoes1/4 cup of red onion - sliced paper thin4 oz. of crumbled feta1/4 cup of torn mint leaves1/4 cup of chopped parsley1/2 cup of crispy chickpeas - store-bought or homemade2 Tbsp. of sesame seedshandful of dill For the turmeric tahini dressing1/4 cup of tahini1/4 cup of room temp water1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar1 lemon - juiced1 tsp. of turmericdash of cayenne1/2 tsp. of curry powder2 cloves of garlic - grated1 tsp. of toasted sesame oil1/3 cup of flat-leaf parsley1/2 cup of extra virgin olive oil1/2 tsp. of sea saltfresh ground pepper to tasteDirectionsPreheat the oven to 425’ and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
