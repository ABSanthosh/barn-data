All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.At some point in the last few years, drinkware became a fashion accessory — a trend we can totally get behind. From Stanley Quencher Tumblers to Owala water bottles, popular drinkware has also been known to sell out. One of the most recent drinkware pieces that was desperately in need of a restock is the Ello Ava Tumbler, and fortunately it has finally returned to Target shelves. The Ello Ava tumbler holds 18 ounces of your favorite iced drinks, from iced coffee to infused water to smoothies. It comes in two flirty, feminine colors: cream and light pink. If you’re one of the many who relies on cute drinkware to help you stay hydrated, this is the cup you’ve been waiting for.The Ava tumbler is totally BPA-free, and all of its parts are dishwasher safe, including its silicone grip band, which is not only helpful at making sure your cup doesn’t slip, but it also prevents condensation from collecting on your table or desk. Splash-resistant, the cup is travel-friendly and was designed to fit perfectly into your car cupholder, so it’s perfect for cutting down on plastic waste during your next road trip or even while you’re out running errands.“Hands down the most perfect iced coffee cup around. It holds the perfect amount of ice, coffee, and cream. I like the glass container and the lid is rubber and has a rubber area at the top so if you do drop it the rubber absorbs the blow,” wrote one Target reviewer. “So cute! Perfect for my morning iced coffee. The silicone ring easily slides off and on, so the cup can be cleaned everywhere,” commented another. Thinking about picking up a cup or two? You’ll want to head over to your nearest Target or place an order online ASAP, because it’s bound to sell out once again.
