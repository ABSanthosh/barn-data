Hotline and its super active users have been a thriving part of the Food52 family for years, answering and asking all sorts of culinary questions. And now, just in time for baking and roasting and stirring season, we're adding to our ever-lively community. Leading the charge is Justin Sullivan, a new addition to the Food52 team, whose entire job is to respond to all your cooking, entertaining, cleaning, and eating questions. (Fun gig, right?) So please, ask away! What makes Justin so great? He's a professional cook and, in his words, a lover of trashy food who has worked in all types of kitchens: from a cooking school in Madrid to some of Brooklyn’s best pizza shops. From there, Justin went on to work at Delish, doing essentially every job they'd let him do: dishwasher, recipe developer, and chicken finger theorist. Viral videos that feature Justin's recipes have garnered millions of views—and tons of praise from his mom. And now, Justin is going to be on call 24/7 to help you become the best home cook you can be. Want to know if you can use bread flour in your brownie recipe? He’s got you covered. Need a non-alcoholic cocktail to pair with your pulled pork nachos? Justin has at least four incredible ideas. All you have to do is ask. To submit a question, go to our Hotline page or leave a voicemail at 1 (877) 52-HOTLINE. (He really does listen to all of your messages!) And he might choose your question to answer in a future video. So don't be shy, ask away! What cooking question do you have for Justin? Ask in the comments below, or over at our Hotline. Food52 (we cook 52 weeks a year, get it?) is a food and home brand, here to help you eat thoughtfully and live joyfully. Popular on Food52",
