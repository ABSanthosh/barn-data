I have always bought the chocolate chip version but if you’re a PB fan, this is a must try. It’s so good. Good and Gather olive pouches. This is a perfect snack if you’re crazy for olives like me. These don’t have to be refrigerated and I live for an olive snacl! Good and Gather roasted poblano cremosa. Another Target find! Oh my gosh – this is SO good. Drizzled on nachos, tacos, used as dip, even on salads. I am loving it so much. The fire roasted flavor is incredible. HOME MOFT magnetic phone tripod. Obsessed with this little tripod. It’s SO easy to use. It’s great if you just need to have your phone propped up. And it’s magnetic! Easiest ever. Wood \u0026 marble lazy susan. I just got this for my olive oil/salt situation on my counter. I’ve had two others break, but this seems much sturdier than what I’ve had in the past. It’s also super pretty. Our Place titanium always pan. LOVE this pan so much right now. It’s all I’ve been using. I want to get (at least) one more! BEAUTY Lake \u0026 Sky 11:11 Vanilla. I love the OG 11:11. I’ve had a travel one in my car for a few years now – I’ve probably gone through 3 or 4 travel sprays. It’s SO fresh and clean. This smells exactly the same, with some vanilla! That’s my weakness, so I instantly loved it. Tower 28 confetti cake lip balm. I was super excited about this shade – I love a cool toned lavender. And this formula is incredible. YSL Make Me Blush Blush. As a blush freak, I’d like to say that this is my new favorite. Lasts forever and the formula is super silky and pigmented. Dyson air straight. I didn’t want to love this!! I have the airwrap and love it. But I wear my hair straight a lot… and after watching tiktok, I finally caved. OMG. This now saves me an entire step of using a straighter. Also, it’s at a lower temp and probably so much better for my hair. I am super impressed!! I also have used it on Emilia’s hair and it’s so easy. FASHION Spanx Air Essentials crewneck. Years later, still the best throw-on-and-go crewneck ever. It drapes so nicely. It looks brand new, years later. Super light and comfortable too. I always want every new shade they come out with. Nike Air Max 90 LV8. New fave alert. I LIVE for a platform. These are insanely high and I love them. They are borderline ridiculous and wonderful. I got the red/pink/iridescent version! All in Motion drawstring jacket. Speaking of air essentials, this jacket feels almost exactly like it!! I didn’t love the crewneck from this line, but this jacket is adorable and so lightweight and nice for spring. Striped t-shirt maxi dress. I grabbed this while at Target a few weeks ago, it’s the perfect spring uniform. This, a little jacket, slides or sneakers… done! MEDIA First Time Caller. While I’m still in a reading rut after The Favorites, I loved this book this month! Definitely my fave of the month. Call Her Daddy podcast with Monica Lewinsky. This episode is SO GOOD. I am very very excited about Monica’s new podcast. KIDS Lite Brite Touch. This has been saving us at activities. Jordan loves it! I always pack a bag with fun things to do and this has been a winner. Sundae body wash. My inner tween LOVES this – as does Emilia. Haha. I got it for her for Valentine’s day. It smells incredible. She loves using it! I would have flipped over this as a kid. Shashibo shape shifting cube. Max’s current obsession. He will sit and play with it forever.
