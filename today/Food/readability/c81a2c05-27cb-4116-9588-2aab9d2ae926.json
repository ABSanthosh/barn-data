  "description": "Phew. I used to use this space as a public journal, like old school blogger days plus a recipe, but I still don’t have words yet. That is ok. Most mornings I wake up in the morning, Hugh brings me coffee so I can check my emails and read the news, which as of late, isn’t a great way to start the day. I do it anyway, and sometimes I just cry. I cry for people who are loosing loved ones and not even getting to say goodbye, for medical professionals who do not have the gear they need - who are also getting sick and have to go to work scared of such risk. I cry about SO many who have lost jobs, who cannot work at home with their kids there full time better yet homeschool them, or those who are uncomfortable at home even on good days, who have had retirements wiped out or are in the midst of chemo or pregnant and scared to death of catching the virus. This is all BIG, and I feel so much in the span of a day, I can’t pin it down to paper. Day at a time. Hour by hour. Check in on your people. Send cards or a text or a funny meme. Drink in the good moments and get outside when things feel like too much a try to wait until 3pm for happy hour. That is how we take the days so far. Most of my work is focused on dinner plans. I always make more than we need, and since my husband and I work from home, we usually eat leftovers for lunches. Due to current circumstances, I’m getting lots of questions from you all about lunch ideas. Everyone is home and everyone is eating allllllll day long! I made this quinoa dish last week and thought I’d put notes here. I’ve written similar things before and it’s super easy, but it doesn’t sound like many of us have the bandwidth or grocery trips to get fussy right now. A week of lunchesEggs Gribiche On asparagus as written, on toast, plain with crackers, smashed between a tender bun etc. Fried Egg SandwichesToasted English muffin, fried egg, crispy bacon or not, arugula, avocado sauce Chicken Tender TacosHoping you have crispy chicken tenders or fish sticks in your freezer? We have some simple homemade ones in SK Little Sprouts! A swipe of refried beans, hot sauce, and another reason to make the aforementioned avocado sauce!Tortellini with Creamy Spinach SauceReheats easily. Add some cooked chicken sausage if you want more protein, or baby tomatoes if your people are into that. Roasted Vegetable OrzoThis includes more summery vegetables but I think you could riff with springy things - peas, leeks, asparagus.Heidi’s Quinoa PattiesThis recipe makes SO many. Halve it or freeze some. You can sub in half cauli rice for the quinoa yield and they still work, or add in some thawed, frozen spinach into the mixture to get in some extra greens. You can eat them plain with a sauce or put them on hawaiian rolls for the kiddos. Beach Day Tuna SaladPacked with herbs and golden raisins and lots of mustard from our first cookbook. Obv I think you should buy our cookbook (which feels vintage at this point) but riffed and revised because I love you:2 (5-ounce) cans water-packed tuna, drained + ¼ cup golden raisins + 2 celery stalks, tiny dice + 1/4 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley + 1 tablespoon whole grain mustard + 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard + 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice + 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or good-quality mayonnaise + generous season of salt and freshly ground pepperSturdy whole grain crackers, for dippingGoodness WrapsThis does sound like a few steps, but make batches of the insides then you can repeat them many times! Also great in bowl form. Snack Plates!Yes, that is an exclamation. Breathe life into what is chopped things on a plate. My kids love things arranged in color coordinated groups and I like to take a meal off. We love the Simple Mills Almond Crackers, (also at costco), hummus or guacamole, thin coins of cucumber and carrots, berries, nuts, raisins, cheese and salami for those who want it. It’s a meal! GREEK QUINOA SALAD WITH OLIVE DRESSINGServes 4-6*For perfect quinoa, rinse it in a mesh strainer. 1 cup quinoa to 1.5 cups broth or seasoned water. Bring it to a simmer. Cover, turn the heat to low and cook for 15 minutes until the liquid is mostly absorbed. Fluff it with a fork. Turn off the heat, leave the cover ajar and let it sit in there for another 10 minutes to finish fluffing, or uncover and cool down completely for the salad below. The dressing is thick from all the olives, but once it’s distributed in the quinoa, it works out. Add a splash more oil and vinegar if you prefer. The whole situation will absorb the dressing as it sits in the fridge. DirectionsCook and cool your quinoa. Chop all your vegetables and herbs. Put everything, besides the cheese, in a large mixing bowl. Stir the dressing ingredients together. Pour them over the salad and toss everything to mix. Season to taste. Add the cheese, give it all one more stir. Store the salad in the fridge for up to five days. Serve it over greens, alone, with chicken or fish etc. Ingredients2 cups cooked quinoa*2 Persian/1 english cucumbers, seeded, tiny dice3 Tbsp. minced shallot1 cup diced tomatoes1 red bell pepper, cored, tiny dice1 bundle of mint, chopped1/2 bundle of parsley, chopped3 ounces. crumbled feta cheesefor the Olive Dressing2/3 cup olive tapenade or well chopped olives1 garlic clove, grated3 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil2 Tbsp. red wine vinegar2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juicedried oreganosalt and pepper",
