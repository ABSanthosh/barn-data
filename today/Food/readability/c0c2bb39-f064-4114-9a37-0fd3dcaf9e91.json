Mostly, we’ve been too busy eating it for me to grab the camera and shoot it and then sit down and write the recipe, which is hilarious as that’s, like, my whole job. But my brain softens in the summer, especially when my kids are away at sleepaway camp, as they are now, and we quickly lose whatever tethers we had to things like to-do lists, responsibilities, and adulting. And while I do not expect a skirt steak with a cherry tomato and sweet corn salad to shake the cooking internet off its axis, there are a bunch of tips tucked into this recipe that make it a reliable favorite, and I hope become part of your repertoire too. The steak rub has some brown sugar in it. There’s enough salt that it is still savory, not sweet, but I absolutely love the way it improves caramelization at the edges. I don’t make or eat a ton of steak but when I do, I obsessively (yes, obsessively) need it to be both black (at the edges) and pink (inside) and the thinner the steak, the harder this is to pull off. But skirt steak is so delicious when done right and feels like it stretches further for a crowd, I can’t resist it here. Two other things help achieve this: a ripping hot grill or pan, one that can impart color on each side in two minutes, and keeping the steak in the fridge until you cook it. I find that if the center arrives on the heat cold, it builds in a better margin of error before it overcooks. My next favorite part of this recipe is that we give the corn a chance to marinate and even gently pickle, dropping it warm from the grill into the vinaigrette and letting it hang out. It contrasts deliciously with the sweet cherry tomatoes, and fistful of herbs. This is easily scaled up for more people, and the salad keeps well so you shouldn’t feel rushed. My perfect summer spread with this would include this Herbed Summer Squash and Potato Torte, the Obsessively Good Avocado and Cucumber Salad, and then definitely some Cheesecake Bars with All The Berries. But if it’s just you, I like the way the steak-salad combination always feels like a full meal. Video Summer Steak with Corn and Tomatoes Steak1 1/4- to 1 1/2-pound skirt steak2 tablespoons brown sugar1 tablespoon kosher salt1 teaspoon sweet or hot smoked paprikaFreshly ground black pepper Salad2 ears fresh corn2 tablespoons olive oil4 tablespoons apple cider vinegar1 teaspoon kosher saltFreshly ground black pepper1 clove garlic, minced4 scallions, thinly sliced (white and green)2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered1 jalapeño, seeds removed, finely chopped1 cup finely-chopped fresh herbs such as parsley, mint, basil, chives, or a mix thereof Prep the steak: Pat steak dry and place on a plate or tray. If your grill or pan for cooking is smaller than the length of it, cut the steak into segments that will fit. Combine sugar, salt, paprika, and many grinds of black pepper in a small bowl then sprinkle half of it over the top of the steak; flip steak over and repeat on the second side. Transfer to the fridge and let chill for 30 minutes or up to a few hours, until you’re ready to grill. I do this uncovered to encourage the edges to dry out, which is just my preference; loosely covered works too. Make corn and tomato salad: Cook the corn your favorite way; I use the grill. Heat your grill to a high heat. Shuck the cobs, removing any stringy bits, and lightly oil the cobs. Place directly on the grill and cook until charred spots form, rotating the cobs as needed. This can take about 5 to 10 minutes, depending on how robust your grill is. Set the cobs aside to cool slightly while you make the dressing. Pour olive oil, cider vinegar, kosher salt, many grinds of black pepper, and minced garlic in a medium-large bowl and whisk to combine. When corn is cool enough to handle (with a towel, if needed), cut the kernels from the cob and add to the dressing in the bowl. Scatter tomatoes, jalapeño, scallions, and herbs on top of the corn in layers, but I don’t bother mixing it at this point. I like the corn to marinate and gently pickle in the dressing while I cook the steak. Do ahead: Corn salad can be made 1 hour in advance. If you’d like to make it even earlier, I’d leave the herbs off until right before serving so they don’t discolor. Cook the steak: On a grill: Heat your grill to high for 10 minutes before using it. I like my (small, gas) grill as ripping hot as I can get it for a skirt steak, since it’s so thin and I want to get color on the outside before it overcooks in the center. Lightly oil the grill and the steak, cooking for 2 minutes on the first side, then flipping it and cooking it for 2 minutes on the second side for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board to rest for 5 to 7 minutes. On the stove: Heat your heaviest skillet, ideally cast-iron (this is my forever go-to) over high heat for several minutes, until the pan is smoking hot. Lightly coat it with a neutral oil and add the steak. If you had to cut yours into a few segments, you might only be able to cook two at a time. Cook for 2 minutes on the first side, then flip the steak and cook it for 2 minutes on the second side for a medium-rare steak. Transfer to a cutting board to rest for 5 to 7 minutes. Assemble and serve: Stir tomato-corn salad to mix the ingredients and taste, adjusting seasoning if needed. Once the steak has rested, cut it across the grain into 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick slices. Arrange steak fanned on a serving platter and drizzle any juices that have collected on the cutting board over it. Season lightly with additional salt and pepper. Spoon some tomato-corn salad over it, leaving the rest in a bowl on the side for adding more at the table. Eat right away. Post navigation",
