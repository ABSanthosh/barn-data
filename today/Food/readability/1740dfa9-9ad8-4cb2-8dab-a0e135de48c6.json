All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Courtesy of PublixIf you’ve shopped your grocery store’s deli section recently, you’ll want to check your fridge ASAP. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has just issued a recall on a specific lot of Boar’s Head deli products. The recall is due to a labeling error, and while it might not necessarily make you sick, it’s better to be safe than sorry.The recall pertains to 65 cases of products, which translates to 780 packages of Boar’s Head Smoked Gouda cheese. The cheese, produced by the Alpine Slicing and Cheese Conversion Company based out of Wisconsin, was reportedly sold only in stores in the state of Florida. Fortunately, if you don’t do any grocery shopping in the Sunshine State, you don’t have to worry about your cheese being part of the recalled lot.For those who may be in possession of recalled cheese, it’s easy to tell which products are included. The packages of cheese were each 8 ounces and sold in the refrigerated section, so the recall does not include any cheese purchased at the deli counter. The packages that are included in the recall have the UPC code 0 42421-50006 6 and labelling that says “Distributed by Brunckhorst Co., NY, NY 11206.”While the FDA tends to classify recalls depending on the level of risk, the organization has yet to classify this particular recall, likely because it does not pose any food safety or health risks. If you discover that you do have the recalled cheese in your fridge, don’t worry — it’s safe to eat. After all, the issue was just a labelling error. But, if you’re still wary, you can return it for a refund or exchange it for a new package at the original place of purchase.",
