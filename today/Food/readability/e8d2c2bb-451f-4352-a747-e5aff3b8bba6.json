I bought many boxes before the season started and we’ve had them out each time we’ve had guests. They go like crazy! They are so crisp, the texture is fabulous. And taste amazing too. American Spoon Hot Chocolate. A repeat, but we’re on jar number four. It’s the best. Perfect cut out cookies. I’ve been making this recipe FOR YEARS and it is the best. I make them for every holiday. They are perfect every time and everyone raves about them. I like to use cream cheese frosting for the top. HOME Round serving platters. These have been AMAZING this month for gifting cookies! They are so sturdy and look (and almost feel!) like glass. They are the perfect size – not too big – and are easy to wrap up. Best things ever. Charcuterie boxes. These might be my new favorite thing. Perfect for making charcuterie boxes to gift! Tree cheese board. I used this all month long and love it! BEAUTY Sephora Glossed lip gloss. I think this is new – and I LOVE the consistency. It’s also pigmented with fabulous color – much more than traditional gloss. Iconic London lip oil. I love the cherry shade in “one to watch.” It’s so moisturizing and gives a super pretty glow. It’s a nice neutral red if you don’t want the bold look. Gucci frosted lilac highlighter. This light lavender shade is perfect for a cool-toned highlight. Adore it. Aveeno moisturizing oil mist. This is a new-to-me find and I love it. Every day I use a cream + oil combo after showering. I love that this is in a spray bottle and the smell is SO wonderful. It’s a warmer scent, but not offensive. And it doesn’t linger. Drowsy sleep scrunchie. Might be the best sleep scrunchie I’ve found. I love the kitsch satin ones and have used them for years, but this one is HUGE. It’s so puffy, giant and silky. Best ever. FASHION Snowflake sweater. This was one of my favorite finds of the month! I love that it is more winter-themed than Christmas. Also, it has some neon green in there that is hard to see in the pictures. It’s super fun, cozy, comfy and great for the season. MZ Wallace shearling bag. I’ve mentioned that I’ve been looking for the perfect shearling bag for over a year and I just LOVE this one. It was a holiday collection special and I was so excited to see it. I’ve used it nonstop since buying it. Crossbody, big enough for a water bottle, but not giant… love. Fraser plaid blouse.  I love Tuckernuck during the holidays and find so many great things to wear. I don’t usually go for plaid items because I feel lumberjack-ish but this was the favorite that I bought. It’s just simple and easy and comfortable and goes nicely with black! MEDIA The Most Wonderful Crime of the Year. SUCH a great read! Funny, mysterious, romantic and more. I’ll talk more about it in my December reads. Landman. We are obsessed. It’s so different from Yellowstone in that it doesn’t really give off the aspirational lifestyle vibes. But it has crazy Taylor Sheridan storylines and characters. KIDS Kablast blocks. Jordan got these for Christmas and they are so fun. He has been loving them – so have the other kids! Melissa \u0026 Doug salad spinner. He also got this – and all the kids adore it. Max got a play kitchen when he turned 2 and 8 years later, he still plays with it. All of my kids love the play kitchen/food so much. It’s been the best toy! Guinness World Records 2025. Max LOVES books about facts, etc – and he was so excited about this. He has looked at it for days!!
