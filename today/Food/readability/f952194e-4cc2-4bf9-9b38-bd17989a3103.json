Sure, I’ve got preferences (dry, easy drinking, cheap enough where I could consider buying two bottles) but they’re not deep-seated. I’ll let the person behind the counter—or bar or dining table—take me wherever they think is best. And I’m always better for it. That said, this year, we’re turning our Thanksgiving wine advice over to the professionals. Here are seven great Thanksgiving wines, all under $40, all chosen by sommeliers and those in the business of great sips. Julien Moreno, Sommelier and Restaurant Manager at Benoit You always want a good bottle of bubbles to start—and I love the Cava Recaredo Terrers Brut Nature Gran Réserva. It’s fresh, bright, and has a lot of texture. It develops notes of citrus that linger while leaving room for decadent pecans and a more nutty sherry-like profile. A crowd pleaser without the Champagne price tag. Julien Moreno, Sommelier \u0026 Restaurant Manager at NYC’s Benoit My choice would be a white wine that’s slightly rich but that has enough acidity to lighten the rich dinner ahead. In this case I’d suggest a delicious bottle of Laurent Tribut Chablis in a fruity vintage such as 2018 or 2019. Carenn Mackinnon, Owner of Williamsburg’s Plus de Vin For white, I’m bringing Barbichette Poc a Poc. Louisiane and César are making really beautiful, exciting wines in the Finger Lakes. All of the fruit is responsibly grown, and the wines are made naturally, with no added yeasts, chemicals, or overt manipulation. Poc a Poc is lightly macerated Muscat—so it’s aromatic, super fresh, incredibly delicious and a perfect way to start Thanksgiving day while you nibble around the kitchen. David Bruno, Founder of Départ Wine Thanksgiving is a wine professional’s Super Bowl. We get to introduce semi-casual drinkers to new wines every holiday. This year I think Aunt Becky is ready for some skin contact wine, which she probably refers to as “orange” wine. Not only do skin contact wines often have great acidity—they also have light to medium tannins that hold up to the fat in your turkey and sauces. For an entry level skin contact, I like Gulp Hablo 2023 from Bodegas Parra Jimenez. It’s a fresh blend of Verdejo, Garnacha, and Sauvignon Blanc, and it comes in a liter bottle that’s usually under $20 at the store. Gulp it up pre-dinner, during dinner, and post-dinner—it works with everything. To level up, I like Les Vins Pirouettes “Orange Cubic Francois” 2023. Alsace is where the Gewurztraminer grape is most resplendent, while traditionally super aromatic and floral, François Bléger gives this wine 12 days of skin contact which mutes some of the more pungent characteristics of the grape. Perfect for your fruity sauces and even pies. Carenn Mackinnon, Owner of Williamsburg’s Plus de Vin For a lighter red, go with Maison en Belles Lies 'l'entrange' from Burgundy. You'd obviously think this is all Pinot Noir, however Pierre blends in Gamay \u0026 Chardonnay as well, making a juicy, bright red for an iconic Thanksgiving pairing (without subjecting yourself to your family's bottle of cheap Beaujolais Village). And for something weightier, Herve Souhaut's Syrah from Saint Joseph. His wines absolutely sing to me. They are wildly true to the varietal \u0026 have such a sense of place, yet the winemaking is light handed in a way that lifts the wine, rather than weighs it down. This should make the Cab drinkers happy and won't overpower the meal with tannin or alcohol. What's your go to Thanksgiving wine? Let us know in the comments below!",
