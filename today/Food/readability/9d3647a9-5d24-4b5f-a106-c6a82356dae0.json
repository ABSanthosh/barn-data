All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: All-CladBecause I’m both an avid home cook and someone who writes about products for a living, it should come as no surprise that my kitchen is filled with all sorts of cookware. Whether it’s nonstick pans, Dutch ovens, or saucepans, I’ve tested out lots of different types ranging from affordable to decently expensive. I, of course, have my go-to pieces that I adore and cook with daily, and recently, an unexpected pan has joined their ranks.The Universal Pan from All-Clad has quickly become one of the most-used items in my kitchen. While I’m not the least bit surprised that my new favorite pan is from All-Clad — a brand loved by so many chefs, home cooks, and my very own teammates at The Kitchn — I wasn’t totally sure I was going to find a lot of uses for it amongst my other cookware. I quickly realized that I was sorely mistaken because this pan can do everything my other daily-use pans can — and it can do it even better. Plus, it’s currently marked down for Presidents’ Day, so you can get one for yourself for less!What Is the All-Clad Universal Pan with Lid?All-Clad’s Universal Pan with Lid has become my go-to pan for cooking basically everything. The 3-quart pan has a nearly 13-inch cooking surface, which makes it larger than any of the pans I would typically cook with in my kitchen. The Universal Pan is also pretty shallow, with a 3.5-inch depth, which what originally threw me for a loop. I was concerned it would be too shallow, but I’m happy to report that it definitely isn’t. Balanced out by its wide surface area, its unique proportions actually make it amazing for cooking all sorts of different things — whether I want to make a toasted sandwich, sauté some ground beef for tacos, or fry off a couple of eggs for breakfast.And as you might expect from All-Clad, this pan is made from stainless steel using its famous tri-ply construction, so you can use it both on your stovetop and in your oven. It’s fully bonded to the rim, which results in even cooking, and the pro-grade 18/10 stainless steel surface sears expertly every time. All of this, of course, also contributes to the pan’s serious versatility.Why I Love the All-Clad Universal Pan with LidEven though I wasn’t sure what I was going to think of All-Clad’s Universal Pan at first, it has turned out to really live up to its name. The more I use it, the more I find I can do with it. I’ve made a number of dishes with it at this point, but my favorite was a white bean enchilada skillet. Not only was it so easy to cook all the veggies in the pan, but then I also was able to pop it right under my broiler to melt the top layer of cheese to gooey perfection.I also love making fried eggs in it because it’s so roomy. My normal egg pan is 8.5 inches, so I enjoy making two fried eggs at once in the Universal Pan and flipping each separately without accidentally bumping the other. And I have to mention that this will be my go-to pan moving forward for making toasted sandwiches. I usually use a nonstick pan for this, but the stainless steel gave my grilled cheese the most perfect crispy, golden exterior. I can’t believe I didn’t make the switch sooner.All-Clad’s Universal Pan could truly replace a number of my pans, and as much as I love my cookware collection, I would let it. I typically use a few different pans for eggs, ground beef, broccoli, shrimp, and one-pot meals — all things I eat regularly. This pan, however, can cook all of those extremely well all in one. Since I started using it a few weeks ago, it has found a permanent home on my stovetop, and I don’t see it going anywhere. Now that it’s on sale for $150, I would absolutely recommend picking one up for your own kitchen (especially if you’re looking to consolidate your cookware!). Buy: All-Clad Universal Pan with Lid, $149.99 (normally $195)Cook/ShopA weekly newsletter to keep you up to date on all the latest cooking gadgets, must-have kitchen tools, and can’t-miss sales to shop.",

I typically use a few different pans for eggs, ground beef, broccoli, shrimp, and one-pot meals — all things I eat regularly. This pan, however, can cook all of those extremely well all in one. Since I started using it a few weeks ago, it has found a permanent home on my stovetop, and I don’t see it going anywhere. Now that it’s on sale for $150, I would absolutely recommend picking one up for your own kitchen (especially if you’re looking to consolidate your cookware!). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuy: \u003ca rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored noreferrer\" data-link-type=\"product\" data-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:4828321192869888\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://atmedia.link/product?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.all-clad.com%2Fd3-stainless-3-ply-bonded-cookware-universal-pan-with-lid-3-quart.html\u0026amp;referralSource=%7BREFERRAL_SOURCE%7D\u0026amp;id=23710218\u0026amp;site=KT\u0026amp;refUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thekitchn.com%2Fall-clad-universal-pan-review-ll-23710218\" data-gtm-teaser-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:4828321192869888\" data-gtm-teaser-product-name=\"D3 Stainless 3-ply Bonded Cookware, Universal Pan with Lid, 3 quart\" data-gtm-teaser-product-price=\"195.00\" data-gtm-teaser-product-retailers=\"All-Clad\" data-gtm-teaser-product-tags=\"cookware-frying-pan\" data-gtm-teaser-product-url=\"https://www.all-clad.com/d3-stainless-3-ply-bonded-cookware-universal-pan-with-lid-3-quart.html\" data-gtm-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:4828321192869888\" data-gtm-product-name=\"D3 Stainless 3-ply Bonded Cookware, Universal Pan with Lid, 3 quart\" data-gtm-product-price=\"195.00\" data-gtm-product-retailers=\"All-Clad\" data-gtm-product-tags=\"cookware-frying-pan\" data-gtm-product-url=\"https://www.all-clad.com/d3-stainless-3-ply-bonded-cookware-universal-pan-with-lid-3-quart.html\" data-gtm-trigger=\"element-visible click\" data-gtm-event-category=\"ecommerce\" data-gtm-ui-component=\"post_product_text_link\"\u003eAll-Clad Universal Pan with Lid\u003c/a\u003e, $149.99 (normally $195)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003csection data-testid=\"Post__item\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCook/Shop\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA weekly newsletter to keep you up to date on all the latest cooking gadgets, must-have kitchen tools, and can’t-miss sales to shop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
