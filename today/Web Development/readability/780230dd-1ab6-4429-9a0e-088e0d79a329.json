Now, the teamâ€™s back with another announcement: Along with the version 3.13 release, GSAP, and all its awesome plugins, are now freely available to everyone. Thanks toÂ WebflowÂ GSAP is nowÂ 100% freeÂ including all of the bonus plugins likeÂ SplitText,Â MorphSVG, and all the others that were exclusively available to Club GSAP members. Thatâ€™s right, the entire GSAP toolset is free,Â even for commercial use!Â ðŸ¤¯ Webflow is celebrating over on their blog as well: With Webflowâ€™s support, the GSAP team can continue to lead the charge in product and industry innovation while allowing even more developers the opportunity to harness the full breadth of GSAP-powered motion.
