  "text": "If I were starting with CSS today for the very first time, I would first want to spend time understanding writing modes because that’s a great place to wrap your head around direction and document flow. But right after that, and even more excitedly so, I would jump right into display and get a firm grasp on layout strategies. And where would I learn that? There are lots of great resources out there. I mean, I have a full course called The Basics that gets into all that. I’d say you’d do yourself justice getting that from Andy Bell’s Complete CSS course as well. But, hey, here’s a brand new way to bone up on layout: Miriam Suzanne is running a workshop later this month. Cascading Layouts is all about building more resilient and maintainable web layouts using modern CSS, without relying on third-party tools. Remember, Miriam works on CSS specifications, is a core contributor to Sass, and is just plain an all-around great educator. There are few, if any, who are more qualified to cover the ins and outs of CSS layout, and I can tell you that her work really helped inspire and inform the content in my course. The workshop is online, runs April 28-30, and is a whopping $ 100 off if you register by April 12. Just a taste of what’s included: Direct Link →",
