  "text": "Layout. It‚Äôs one of those easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master things, like they say about playing bass. Not because it‚Äôs innately difficult to, say, place two elements next to each other, but because there are many, many ways to tackle it. And layout is one area of CSS that seems to evolve more than others, as we‚Äôve seen in the past 10-ish years with the Flexbox, CSS Grid, Subgrid, and now Masonry to name but a few. May as well toss in Container Queries while we‚Äôre at it. And reading flow. And‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs a good way to start talking about a new online course that Ahmad Shadeed is planning to release called The Layout Maestro. I love that name, by the way. It captures exactly how I think about working with layouts: orchestrating how and where things are arranged on a page. Layouts are rarely static these days. They are expected to adapt to the user‚Äôs context, not totally unlike a song changing keys. Ahmad is the perfect maestro to lead a course on layout, as he does more than most when it comes to experimenting with layout features and demonstrating practical use cases, as you may have already seen in his thorough and wildly popular interactive guides on Container Queries, grid areas, box alignment, and positioning (just to name a few). The course is still in development, but you can get a leg up and sign up to be notified by email when it‚Äôs ready. That‚Äôs literally all of the information I have at this point, but I still feel compelled to share it and encourage you to sign up for updates because I know few people more qualified to wax on about CSS layout than Ahmad and am nothing but confident that it will be great, worth the time, and worth the investment. I‚Äôm also learning that I have a really hard time typing ‚Äúmaestro‚Äù correctly. ü§ì Direct Link ‚Üí",
