I caved in, taught him the basic FPS key binds, and he was having a great time. While he was fragging out, he pressed a bunch of random keys and ended up changing movement buttons. Suddenly the traditional WASD movement keys were useless and the arrow keys triggered movement. Of course, this was a degradation of player experience. After struggling to figure out what my son did, I found the solution. To restore the WASD keys as movement keys, press the FN+W key combination. You'll switch back to WASD keys for movement and be back on top of your game!
