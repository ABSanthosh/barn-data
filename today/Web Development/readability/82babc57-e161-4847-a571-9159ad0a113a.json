I sat down with Heydon Pickering in the most recent episode of the Smashing Hour. Full transparency: I was nervous as heck. I’ve admired Heydon’s work for years, and even though we run in similar circles, this was our first time meeting. You know how you build some things up in your mind and sorta psyche yourself out? Yeah, that. Heydon is nothing short of a gentleman and, I’ll be darned, easy to talk to. As is the case with any Smashing Hour, there’s no script, no agenda, no nothing. We find ourselves getting into the weeds of accessibility testing and documentation — or the lack of it — before sliding into the stuff he’s really interested in and excited about today: styling sound. Dude pulled out a demo and walked me (and everyone else) through the basics of the Web Audio API and how he’s using it to visualize sounds in tons of groovy ways that I now want hooked up to my turntable somehow.
