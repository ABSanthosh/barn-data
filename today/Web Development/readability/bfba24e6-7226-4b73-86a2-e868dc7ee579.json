Many of you — perhaps most of you — have been sitting on the sidelines while WordPress and WP Engine trade legal attacks on one another. It’s been widely covered as we watch it unfold in the open; ironically, in a sense. These things can take twists and turns and it doesn’t help that this just so happens to be an emotionally charged topic in certain circles. WordPress is still the leading CMS after all these years and by a long shot. Many developers make their living in the WordPress ecosystem. All of those developers need hosting. WP Engine is still the leading WordPress-flavored host after many years. Many developers host their agencies there and use it to administrate their clients’ sites. And I haven’t even gotten to the drama. That’s not really the point. The point is that there’s a bunch of heated words flying around and it can be difficult to know where they’re coming from, who they are aimed at, and most importantly, why they’re being said in the first place. So, I’m going to round up a few key voices contributing to the discussion for the sake of context and to help catch up. Editor’s Note: Even though CSS-Tricks has no involvement with either company, I think it’s mentioning that Automattic was a looooooong time sponsor. This site was also once hosted by Flywheel, a company acquired by WP Engine before we moved to Cloudways following the DigitalOcean acquisition. Me? My personal site runs on WP Engine, but I’m not precious about it having only been there one year. Prelude to a tweet We had fair warning that something was coming up when WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg sent this out over X: I know private equity and investors can be brutal (read the book Barbarians at the Gate). Please let me know if any employee faces firing or retaliation for speaking up about their company's participation (or lack thereof) in WordPress. We'll make sure it's a big public deal and…— Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) September 19, 2024 There’s the ammo: Don’t let private equity bully you into speaking up against the company you work for when its contributions to WordPress are on the slim side of things. Private equity. Lack of participation in the WordPress community. Making a big public deal of it. Remember these things because this is one day before… WordCamp US 2024 Matt spoke at WordCamp US (WCUS) 2024 in Portland, OR, last week. September 20 to be exact. Making big, bold statements at WCUS isn’t a new thing for Matt, as many of us still have “Learn JavaScript deeply” tattooed on the brain from 2016. Matt’s statements this year were less inspirational (instructional?) as they took direct aim at WP Engine as part of a presentation on the merits of open-source collaboration. You can watch and listen to where the first jab was thrown roughly around the 10:05 marker of the recording. Let’s break down the deal. Matt begins by comparing the open-source contributions to WordPress from his company, Automattic, to those of WP Engine. These things are tracked on WordPress.org as part of a campaign called “Five for the Future” that’s designed to give organizations an influential seat at the table to form the future of WordPress in exchange for open-source contributions back to the WordPress project. Automattic has a page totaling its contributions. So does WP Engine. Before Matt reveals the numbers, he goes out of his way to call out the fact that both Automattic and WP Engine are large players in the neighborhood of $500 million dollars. That’s the setup for Matt to demonstrate how relatively little WP Engine contributes to WordPress against Matt’s own company. Granted, I have absolutely no clue what factors into contributions, nor how the pages are administrated or updated. But here’s what they show… Quite the discrepancy! I’d imagine Automattic dwarfs every other company that’s pledged to the campaign. Maybe it would be better to compare the contributions of another non-Automattic pledge that has a fairly strong reputation for participating in WordPress community. 10up is one of the companies that comes straight to my mind and they are showing up for 191 hours per week, or roughly five times WP Engine’s reported time. I get conflicting info on 10up’s revenue, valuation, and size, so maybe the comparison isn’t fair. Or maybe it is fair because 10up is certainly smaller than WP Engine, and no estimate I saw was even close to the $500 million mark. Whatever the case, bottom line: Matt calls out WP Engine for its lack of effort on a very public stage — maybe the largest — in WordPress Land. He doesn’t stop there, going on to namecheck Silver Lake, a ginormous private equity firm bankrolling the company. The insinuation is clear: there’s plenty of money and resources, so pony up. That’s bad enough for attendees to raise eyebrows, but it doesn’t end there. Matt encourages users and developers alike to vote with money by not purchasing hosting from WP Engine (11:31) and seems to suggest (23:05) that he’ll provide financial support to any WP Engine employees who lose their jobs from speaking up against their employer. I think I can get behind the general idea that some companies need a little prodding to pull their weight to something like the Five for the Future campaign. Encouraging developers to pull their projects from a company and employees to jeopardize their careers? Eek. “WP Engine is not WordPress” This is when I believe things got noisy. It’s one thing to strong-arm a company (or its investors) into doing more for the community. But in a post on his personal blog the day after WCUS, Matt ups the ante alleging that “WP Engine isn’t WordPress.” You’d think this is part of the tough-guy stance he had from the stage, but his argument is much different in this post. Notice it’s about how WP Engine uses WordPress in its business rather than how much the company invests in it: WordPress is a content management system, and the content is sacred. Every change you make to every page, every post, is tracked in a revision system, just like the Wikipedia. This means if you make a mistake, you can always undo it. It also means if you’re trying to figure out why something is on a page, you can see precisely the history and edits that led to it. These revisions are stored in our database. This is very important, it’s at the core of the user promise of protecting your data, and it’s why WordPress is architected and designed to never lose anything. WP Engine turns this off. They disable revisions because it costs them more money to store the history of the changes in the database, and they don’t want to spend that to protect your content. It strikes to the very heart of what WordPress does, and they shatter it, the integrity of your content. OK, gloves off. This is more personal. It’s no longer about community contributions but community trust and how WP Engine erodes trust by preventing WordPress users from accessing core WordPress features for their own profit. Required reading That’s where I’d like to end this, at least for now. Several days have elapsed since Matt’s blog post and there are many, many more words flying around from him, community members, other companies, and maybe even your Great Aunt. But if you’re looking for more signal than noise, I’ve rounded up a few choice selections that I feel contribute to the (heated) discussion. Reddit: Matt Mullenweg needs to step down from WordPress.org leadership ASAP Matt responds to the requisite calls for him to step down, starting with: To be very clear, I was 100% cordial and polite to everyone at the booth, my message was: * I know this isn’t about them, it’s happening several levels above, it’s even above their CEO, it’s coming from their owner, Silver Lake and particularly their board member Lee Wittlinger. * Several people inside WP Engine have been anonymously leaking information to me about their bad behavior, and I wanted to let them know if they were caught or faced retaliation that I would support them in every way possible, including covering their salaries until they found a new job. * That *if* we had to take down the WP Engine booth and ban WP Engine that evening, my colleague Chloé could print them all new personal badges if they still wanted to attend the conference personally, as they are community members, not just their company. This was delivered calmly, and they said thank you, and their head of comms, Lauren Cox, who was there asked that they have time to regroup and discuss. Automattic’s Actionable Misconduct Directed to WP Engine WP Engine issues a cease and desist letter designed to stop Matt from disparaging them publicly. But hold up, because there’s another juicy claim in there: In the days leading up to Mr. Mullenweg’s September 20th keynote address at the WordCamp US Convention, Automattic suddenly began demanding that WP Engine pay Automattic large sums of money, and if it didn’t, Automattic would wage a war against WP Engine. And yes, they did issue it from their own site’s /wp-content directory. That’s easy to lose, so I’ve downloaded it to link it for posterity. Open Source, Trademarks, and WP Engine Just today, Matt published a cease and desist letter to the Auttomatic blog where he alleges that WP Engine’s commercial modifications to WordPress Core violate the WordPress trademark. Again, this has become about licensing, not contributions: WP Engine’s business model is based on extensive and unauthorized use of these trademarks in ways that mislead consumers into believing that WP Engine is synonymous with WordPress. It’s not. This is trademark abuse, not fair competition. This is no longer WordPress vs. WP Engine. It’s more like Automattic vs. WP Engine. But with Matt’s name quite literally in the name Automattic, let’s be real and call this Matt Mullenweg vs. WP Engine. WP Tavern coverage WP Tavern is still the closest thing we have to an official WordPress news outlet. Nevermind that it’s funded and hired by Automattic (among others). I respect it, though I honestly have been less attentive to it since the team turned over earlier this year. It’s still a great spot to catch up on the post-event coverage: Highlights from Matt Mullenweg’s Spiciest Word Camp Presentation at WordCamp US 2024 (Sep. 24) Automattic Responds to WP Engine’s Cease and Desist with Legal Action (Sep. 24) There’s another more recent WP Tavern article I want to call out because it’s a huge development in this saga… WP Engine Banned from Using WordPress.org Resources Dang. This is the point of no return. It not only affects WP Engine proper, but the Flywheel hosting it also owns. WordPress.org has blocked WP Engine customers from updating and installing plugins and themes via WP Admin.  I was able to update plugins on my site as recently as yesterday, but let’s see as of this morning. Aww, biscuits. Maybe I can still see details about my installed plugins… Double biscuits! This is a bad, bad situation. I have thoughts about it and neither side looks good. Using real people with no dog in the fight to make a point is never gonna be a good look. Then again, both sides have valid points and I can see where they’re coming from. I just hate to see it come to a head like this. Update (Oct. 3, 2024) The story continues, of course — and it ain’t slowing down. WP Tavern is on the ball and publishing regular updates, although remember: it’s an Automattic publication at the end of the day. Matt’s been the most vocal player so far, so it stands to reason that WP Tavern might want to amplify things. In any case… WP Engine Banned Again, Reports Deploying a SolutionWP Tavern reported that WP Engine deployed a workaround for its banned status on WordPress.org, but it was short-lived because whatever loophole they found was plugged up. Notice the screenshots showing strides that WP Engine has taken to distinguish itself from WordPress (the brand) on its site in several places. Automattic Publishes WP Engine Term Sheet Amidst ControversyToday, I learned that (1) this fight has been going on for “years” (in Matt’s words), (2) the royalty rate offered to WP Engine appears to rise with each passing month (it was 7%, then 8%), but (3) but that’s now off the table. Mullenweg threatens corporate takeover of WP EngineOh, my dear! This would be a sad conclusion. That said, I have no bones to pick at Matt’s informal poll asking whether WP Engine’s Advanced Custom Fields Pro should be baked into WordPress Core. I’ve never understood why WordPress has never built a UI for custom fields, perhaps other than the spirit of open source and allowing plugin developers to thrive. Custom fields ought to be a core feature of any CMS as they are needed to, you know, manage content throughout a site by making it more pliable. Update (Oct. 4, 2024) This is all anyone is talking about in my circles. Well, that and Web Components. But the WordPress stuff has blown up way past the point where I’m even able to capture and wrap my mind around everything that’s come out in the past 48 hours alone. Yesterday’s update didn’t make mention of this two-hour interview between Matt and Theo. I won’t tell you to watch all of it because I’m not planning to watch all of it, but I certainly saw enough. And, besides, Theo published a follow-up to it yesterday after his interview was cited in a new WP Engine legal complaint filed against Automattic (PDF). The follow-up video is worth eatching in full — it’s a mere 13 minutes compared to the two-hour epic marathon and will catch you up. Plus, you’ll get new salacious details, including an allegation that Matt at one point threatened the WP Engine CEO with extortion if a deal to work for Automattic was declined. Not long after Theo’s follow-up video was published, Matt took to his personal blog to talk about a severance package being offered to Automattic employees who disagree with him to the extent that they would prefer to walk out and call it a day: So we decided to design the most generous buy-out package possible, we called it an Alignment Offer: if you resigned before 20:00 UTC on Thursday, October 3, 2024, you would receive $30,000 or six months of salary, whichever is higher. But you’d lose access to Automattic that evening, and you wouldn’t be eligible to boomerang (what we call re-hires). HR added some extra details to sweeten the deal; we wanted to make it as enticing as possible. If you’re wondering whether anyone took it… yep! 159 people took the offer, 8.4% of the company, the other 91.6% gave up $126M of potential severance to stay! 63.5% were male. 53% were in the US. By division it impacted our Ecosystem / WordPress areas the most: 79.2% of the people who took it were in our Ecosystem businesses, compared to 18.2% from Cosmos (our apps like Pocket Casts, Day One, Tumblr, Cloudup). 18 people made over 200k/yr! 1 person started two days before the deadline. 4 people took it then changed their minds. Like I said, this is a lot to follow. I’ll continue to look in and catch up, but if you’re looking for more of a firehose of information, my pal Courtney Roberston is keeping a treasure trove of artifacts that are open for reference.",
