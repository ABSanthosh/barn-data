  "text": "Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences. As announced earlier this year, the Chrome 131 release officially deprecates the experimental Performance Insights panel. It will be removed from DevTools completely in the next Chrome release, early in 2025. The Performance panel contains so much information, it could be difficult to know where to even begin. The Performance Insights panel was an experiment on ways to automatically isolate and focus on the relevant parts of that information for debugging of specific performance and user experience issues, especially Core Web Vitals. The best of those experiments are now being folded back into the Performance panel, combined with the Lighthouse audit engine, and appear as new insights within the Performance panel itself. A sidebar and additional data overlaying the timeline will provide insights into how a page loads and runs, and give advice on improving performance and the user experience. If you're looking to improve your site, the insights can give a great list of where to start. If you're diving deep into a specific performance or architectural issue, the insights can provide entry points, as well as context for when you're immersed in the minutiae of a trace, aiming to help you keep an eye on the bigger picture. Give us feedback Many of these insights may seem familiar from the Performance Insights panel and Lighthouse, but in a brand new context within the Performance panel. Try them out and let us know all the ways they could be improved or what other insights you'd love to see.
