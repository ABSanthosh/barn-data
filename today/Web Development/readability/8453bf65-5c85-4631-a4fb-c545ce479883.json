In this case, Jason’s viral WPGraphQL plugin has not only become a canonical WordPress plugin, but creator Jason Bahl is joining Automattic as well. I’m linking this up because it’s notable for a few reasons: WPGraphQL is a must-have plugin for creating headless WordPress sites and making it a canonical plugin is WordPress making a big step in that direction. Jason is leaving WP Engine to join Automattic and we all know what a dumpster fire that relationship has become. (WP Engine also has a big foot in headless WordPress.) You might be hearing about canonical plugins for the first time. Congrats, Jason! I didn’t know you were in Denver — maybe we’ll bump into each other and I can give you a well-deserved high-five. ✋ Direct Link →",
