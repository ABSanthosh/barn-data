These days sites use blob URLs and other means to prevent downloads. Luckily we have tools like yt-dlp to download individual YouTube videos or entire channels of content. To download an entire channel, you can use yt-dlp: yt-dlp https://www.youtube.com/@beetlejuicearchives3490 If you're like me and only care for the audio, you can use a few more arguments: yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 https://www.youtube.com/@beetlejuicearchives3490 youtube-dl used to be the standard for downloading YouTube videos but yt-dlp seems to have taken the throne. YouTube has such a wealth of information on just about anything, be sure to download content for travel, long walks, or any other reason!",
