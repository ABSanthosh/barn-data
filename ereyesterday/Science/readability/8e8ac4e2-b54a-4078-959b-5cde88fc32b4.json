  "description": "If you’ve ever wondered how you can give a TED Talk, you’re not alone. TED believes that ideas change everything — and that they can come from unexpected places. So, as part of our global Idea Search program, we issued an open call to anyone in the UK in search of the biggest, boldest and brightest ideas. Out of 500 applicants, 10 were selected to speak at a special in-person TED event in partnership with TEDxBrighton. In this film, you’ll meet all 10 speakers and follow the process of going from an idea in someone's head to an actual TED Talk on the stage. We’re always looking for the next big idea — maybe yours could be next. (This video is part of \"My Big Idea,\" a new series from TED that documents the process of imagining and then creating a TED Talk, featuring first-time speakers and ideas new to the TED stage.)",
