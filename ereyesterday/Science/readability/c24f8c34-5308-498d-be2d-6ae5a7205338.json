  "text": "While I have not read all of RFK’s statements closely, my general impression is that he focuses on topics that are potentially important/relevant, and then unfortunately often exaggerates or distorts the facts. In a previous article titled If You Sanewashed RFK Jr., Or If You Sanewashed Doctors Who Did, You Own the Next 4 Years, I discussed doctors who had either written pro-RFK Jr. propaganda articles or profited from Substacks that did.  Examples include: RFK Jr Will Disrupt the US Medical Establishment  by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and Kevin Bardosh Dr. Makary on RFK Jr’s Criticism of the ‘Medical Industrial Complex’: Saying Things ‘People Know Are True’   Dr. Marty Makary Why Doctors Should Learn to Stop Worrying and Love MAHA– by Dr. Joseph Marine Donald Trump Has a Plan to Make America’s Children Healthy Again. It’s a Good One by Dr. Robert Redfield Sabotaging RFK Jr’s Confirmation Will Increase Vaccine Hesitancy by Dr. Vinay Prasad The Cure for Vaccine Skepticism by Dr. Martin Kulldorff The Nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services: a New Beginning? by Dr. Frederik Schaltz-Buchholzer That last article, by Dr. Schaltz-Buchholzer from the monetized misinformation Substack Sensible Medicine, said: While I have not read all of RFK’s statements closely, my general impression is that he focuses on topics that are potentially important/relevant, and then unfortunately often exaggerates or distorts the facts. That’s a profoundly embarrassing thing to have written. According to Dr. Schaltz-Buchholzer, RFK Jr.’s belief that AIDS is not caused by HIV, but rather a “gay lifestyle” is “potentially important/relevant.” Saying that RFK Jr. “exaggerates or distorts the facts” is like saying the Titanic was an unpleasant boat ride. As people who actually bothered to read RFK Jr.’s statements closely know, he is a paranoid, angry crank, utterly disconnected from reality, who wants to take a wrecking ball to everything. Political actors with medical credentials sought to obscure this obvious reality with the pro-RFK Jr. propaganda. RFK Jr. says measles vaccine routinely causes deaths. That’s not true It’s no coincidence that the same doctors who spread absurdities about COVID- just watch their old videos– also claimed that the man behind Vaxxed 3: Authorized to Kill was the perfect guy to save vaccines and science in general. The same patterns are repeating. Although RFK Jr. has been in office for under two months, we can begin to take stock of what these doctors, some who are now part of this administration, now own. US Measles Cases Jump 35% In a Week: Now Found In 12 States A Texas child who was not vaccinated has died of measles, a first for the US in a decade  Remedy Supported by Kennedy Leaves Some Measles Patients More Ill RFK Jr.: It Would Be Better If ‘Everybody Got Measles  RFK Jr. says measles vaccine routinely causes deaths.

As Dr. David Gorksi wrote here on Monday, “Make America Healthy Again”: The New Lysenkoism.  Falling vaccine coverage over the years is a problem that likely increased due to the failed COVID-19 policies you championed. Despite all this, none of the doctors who authored pro-RFK Jr. propaganda pieces have cared enough to look back. As with their false declarations of herd immunity 4-years-ago, reality does not impede them a bit. Doctors who promised that RFK Jr. would restore confidence in vaccines haven’t reflected on whether or not that turned out to be the case. The author of Why Doctors Should Learn to Stop Worrying and Love MAHA hasn’t explained to me why I should “love” everything that’s happening now. In fact several of these doctors are responsible for recent headlines of mass purges and censorship. Their agencies are in complete disarray and their boss is an anti-vaccine crank. This is what they signed up for. These doctors have continued to lavish praise on their new boss. Dr. Bhattacharya recently said he “admires” RFK Jr. and that: He wakes up in the morning asking, “How can I make the lives of children better? How can we address the chronic health needs of the American people?” He has ideas about what causes autism. But from a scientific point of view, there’s been a tremendous increase in autism diagnoses… And we don’t know why. The answer in that situation is to do excellent science so that we can find out what causes it—and then we can address it in an informed way. That’s going to age as well as Dr. Bhattacharya’s prediction that COVID would kill 20,000-40,000 Americans. Other pro-RFK Jr. doctors now claim that RFK Jr. is not responsible for the actions of RFK Jr. In their telling, his 20-year history of anti-vaccine disinformation was magically erased the moment he was sworn into office, and the anti-vaccine disinformation he’s spread since then is also of no consequence.  Desperate to absolve themselves of any responsibility for elevating RFK Jr., they have displaced his assault on science onto those of us who warned about it. Like blaming meteorologists for hurricanes, they absurdly claim that myself and those who warned of disinformation, are the reason parents in Texas are refusing the MMR and poisoning their children with vitamin A. It’s all my fault. If only I’d gotten behind the plan to mass infect unvaccinated people under age 70 to reach herd immunity in 3-6 months, none of this would be happening now. RFK Jr. is blameless. It’s my fault that vaccine clinics are closing in Texas as federal funding is cut. Just where is that extensive 5000 word longform apology from Adam Cifu over at Sensible Medicine, begging forgiveness for legitimizing Robert F. Kennedy, Jr? These pathetic attempts to blame me and the always unnamed “failed COVID-19 policies” I supposedly championed aren’t going to work. My articles explaining why death is worse than vaccine side-effects aren’t the reason kids are being hospitalized with measles. In reality, doctors who fluffed RFK Jr. own RFK Jr. As Pandemic Accountability Index (PAI) wrote in their harsh but fair article RFK Jr. Fanboys Owe You An Apology: I am writing to RFK Jr.’s fan club directly now. You now own this moment. You can toss out the Substack draft, shut down the podcast recording equipment, and drop the tweeting device of your choice. Sure, you can say whatever you want going forward – but it will be forever tainted by the stain that you got your way, your boy wound up in charge – and faced with the basic responsibilities of the role you said he would excel at? RFK Jr. immediately failed. Now a child is dead as a result. There is absolutely zero pieces of media you can publish which could change this fact. You will never wipe away this stain for the rest of your pathetic lives. The general public should hound you at every attempt of a public appearance you make in the future and remind you of what you championed. Your colleagues should look upon you with scorn and embarrassment, that they’re forced to share a workplace with such a useless, incompetent piece of trash. Professional obligations with your name attached should be canceled with explicit condemnations. You all owe the critics of RFK Jr. that you insulted as “covidians” and other childish smears a massive, extensive apology. There is no “debate,” you are just wrong. You got your way with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and he rushed to start treating infectious disease outbreaks with fish oil supplements. With an innocent child paying the ultimate price to entertain your perverted ideals of how science and medicine should function. Just how do you plan to hold The Medical Establishment, which RFK Jr. is now a part of, accountable? Your ideals won out – and now a child is dead of measles because you wanted “revenge” on anyone who struggled to prevent pediatric COVID-19 deaths. RFK Jr’s critics were immediately validated, and you have absolutely nothing to show for it in response. PAI also asked: Just where is that extensive 5000 word longform apology from Adam Cifu over at Sensible Medicine, begging forgiveness for legitimizing Robert F. Kennedy, Jr? Do we have a clip from Real Time With Bill Maher featuring Bari Weiss from The Free Press condemning contributor Vinay Prasad from UCSF for misleading her audience about RFK Jr’s merits?… Those of us who possess at least an incredibly basic understanding of medicine, science, and public health told you precisely how Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services was going to play out. We were immediately proven correct. Don’t seem to see many apologies on social media, however – isn’t that strange?  Those are fair and important questions, but those apologies won’t be coming. No matter how widely measles spreads, Dr. Vinay Prasad won’t apologize for his pro-RFK Jr propaganda, and his business partners, Drs. John Mandrola and Adam Cifu, won’t apologize for profiting from it.  If a miracle occurs and we are healthier in 4 years, I will admit I was wrong about RFK Jr. However, as with COVID, none of the doctors who celebrated RFK Jr. will ever take responsibility for their words. They used the pandemic to build their brand and achieve political power. When RFK Jr. and his ilk threatened the foundations of American science and medicine, they again prioritized their paid subscribers and need to feel “heterodox”. Other people will suffer due to their actions, and it’s our job to constantly remind these doctors of what they enabled, no matter how much they protest that the truth hurts their feelings. We are just getting started, the repercussions will last for many decades, and many people will get hurt along with way.   They told us to love it, and so they own it all. Dr. Jonathan Howard is a neurologist and psychiatrist who has been interested in vaccines since long before COVID-19. He is the author of \"We Want Them Infected: How the failed quest for herd immunity led doctors to embrace the anti-vaccine movement and blinded Americans to the threat of COVID.\" View all posts",
