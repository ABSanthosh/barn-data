Assenova and Raphael Amit of The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, reveals that participation in startup accelerator programs significantly boosts post-acceleration performance for ventures. This research, published in the Strategic Management Journal, examines data from over 8,500 startups across 176 countries, providing critical insights into how accelerator program design shapes startup success. Startup accelerators have become pivotal in fostering entrepreneurial ecosystems globally, offering resources such as seed capital, mentorship, and structured educational programming. The study found that startups participating in accelerators were more likely to raise venture capital, scale their revenue, and expand their workforce compared to those that did not complete these programs. On average, accelerator participation increased startups' revenue and capital-raising capabilities while enhancing their ability to attract top talent through higher wages. \"Our findings underscore the importance of program design in maximizing the benefits of accelerator participation,\" said Assenova, lead author of the study. \"By tailoring their offerings to the unique needs of startups—whether by industry, stage of development, or founder experience—accelerators can unlock the full potential of these ventures.\" This research offers actionable insights for entrepreneurs seeking to leverage accelerators to refine their business models and scale effectively. Policymakers and investors can also use these findings to support programs that provide high-impact, customized resources for startups, particularly in emerging markets where entrepreneurial ecosystems are still developing. The research analyzed data from the Global Accelerator Learning Initiative, encompassing 23,364 accelerator applicants over six years (2013–2019). The study employed rigorous methodologies, including comparative assessments of accelerated and non-accelerated startups, to isolate the factors contributing to post-program success.
