  "text": "On November 22, the United States Department of Agriculture temporarily halted the import of cattle from Mexico after a flesh-eating parasite was detected in animals in southern Mexico. Before the discovery of cattle screwworm (Cochliomyia hominivorax) at an inspection point in the state of Chiapas, the species had previously been eliminated in North America since the end of the 19th century. The US–Mexico border remains closed to cattle and may not reopen until the new year.The worm is the larva of a metallic blue-green fly that spends the early part of its life cycle devouring the living flesh of mammals. Infestations can be fatal. Cows are the screwworm’s favorite feast, but the maggots can also feed on other livestock as well as wildlife and pets. Flies often lay their eggs near open wounds, and if the larvae can find a hole in the skin to deploy their sharp mouth hooks, they will then bury themselves in the animal’s flesh and gorge.The finding in Mexico follows the recent reappearance of the parasite in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala. In the face of the reemergence of the parasite, Mexico is intensifying sanitary measures—calling for the treatment of wounds in livestock, larvicide baths, and deworming of cattle—and has introduced inspection stations like the one that discovered the case in Chiapas. But conservationists from the Wildlife Conservation Society and Mexican ranchers warn that the illegal cattle trade will be the real gateway for the disease to enter North America.Prior to the closure of its border with the US, Mexico’s National Confederation of Livestock Organizations had called on the government to clamp down on cattle smuggling across Mexico’s southern border. The risk from the parasite is great, and if it becomes established again, the cost of eliminating it in Mexico would be high. Disruption of trade with the US was also be highly costly. In 2023 alone, Mexico’s exports of live cattle and beef to the US were worth $3 billion.Cochliomyia hominivorax, the cattle screwworm, is actually a fly. The name refers to the insect’s larvae. Ramdan Fatoni / Getty ImagesOn the Trail of the ScrewwormFor nearly two decades, Cochliomyia hominivorax had been eliminated from the United States down to the Darien Gap in Panama. That was until the summer of 2023, when Panama detected a spike in infestations in animals within 300 kilometers of its northern border with Costa Rica, marking the beginning of the parasite’s reappearance in Central America.Costa Rica, declared free of the aggressive parasite in 1999, then documented outbreaks in July 2023. Nicaragua and Honduras, free of the screwworm since 1996, confirmed cases in April and September of this year respectively. Then in October 2024, Guatemala reported the reemergence of the fly and its larvae, with a calf as its first fatality. The threat to countries further north is clear. According to the Panama–United States Commission for the Eradication and Prevention of Screwworm, as of November 2, these four countries had accumulated 15,638 screwworm cases in 2024, along with 20,890 documented in Panama.In reports submitted to the World Organization for Animal Health, three of those countries—Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras—pointed to the illegal transit of animals as the origin of infections in their territories. Honduras detected an outbreak after inspecting 68 horses that entered the country illegally, for example, just 8 kilometers from its border with Nicaragua.Kurt Duchez, environmental crime coordinator at the Wildlife Conservation Society, explains that the current spread of the disease doesn’t seem to be related to the maximum flight capacity of the fly, which can reach 10 kilometers per day in the absence of food. Rather seems to relate to the movement of livestock, which can travel up to 300 kilometers per day.This aligns with the observations of Alejandro Zaldívar, a doctoral candidate at the Laboratory of Ecology of Diseases and One Health at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Zaldívar has been following the spread of the parasite since April 2024. Together with other laboratory specialists, he uses data from the World Organization for Animal Health’s Global Health Information System to model the speed of the insect’s movement in Central America. His analysis detected patterns of the screwworm advancing up to 300 kilometers between outbreaks.Zaldívar and Duchez have also shown that the geography of the spread the disease maps onto illegal cattle routes that run from Central America to Mexico, which were exposed by the think tank Insight Crime in 2022. “Illegal trade in Central America has been around for a long time. In our analysis we are observing that it is accelerating the spread of the fly,” says Zaldívar. His preliminary results on the spread of the worm are in the process of being published.What seems likely to Duchez is that the parasite is spreading by road: “It’s the highway route, from Honduras to the Mexican border. We share the Mayan jungle in the north of Guatemala, the cows are not going to pass through the jungle, it doesn’t work this way. The illegal movement of cattle occurs with trucks, they arrive at the border, cross them in wooden boats across the Usumacinta River, and continue their way to the other side.” Smuggling by road through Central America often takes place at night, and the animals moved are often emaciated and in poor condition compared to those raised in Mexico, potentially making them more vulnerable to infection.“Illegal cattle coming from Honduras cross northeastern Guatemala, where the country reports 20 outbreaks of screwworm infection near Petén,” says Duchez. Just 5 or 10 kilometers beyond the border, he suggests, the authorities should stop any illegal cattle, as well as any that are unwormed or that have wounds.According to sources consulted by the Insight Crime journalists, two locations in southern Mexico—Benemérito de las Américas and Marqués de Comillas—are “the most important crossing points for cattle smuggling” once animals have completed their route through Central America. Between these locations and Catazajá in Chiapas, where the first case was detected on the Mexican border, Insight Crime has shown that illegal cattle go through a “laundering” process, which consists of putting labels on them and using falsified documents to cross customs without major complications.According to Duchez, the National Service for Health, Safety, and Food Quality in Mexico is waiting for the worm to arrive in Tehuantepec, deeper inside the country, and will mount efforts to stop it spreading further there—a plan he considers misguided. “Once the disease reaches Mexico, it will be uncontrollable. Millions of cows move from the south to the center.” To wait for it to enter the country as far as Tehuantepec, he believes, “would be to sacrifice the trade of the states of the peninsula and Chiapas. The only way to stop it … is to close the border and prevent the cattle from moving.”The movement of livestock seems to explain the rapid advance of the fly. Eddie GeraldThe Fly We Had Already BanishedAlthough it mainly affects cattle, C. hominivorax—Spanish for “maneater”—earned its scientific name from a terrible outbreak among prisoners in a 19th-century penal colony in South America.This insect is endemic to South America and several Caribbean countries. Its life cycle requires pain. Females take advantage of any hole in the skin, even a tick bite wound, to lay between 200 and 300 eggs at a time. From these, larvae hatch and eat live flesh for seven days, then drop to the ground and, in less than a day, take flight as flies. Although females mate only once in their lifetime, they can lay up to 3,000 eggs in the 20 days they live.In the 1950s, an ambitious international campaign was launched to eradicate the insect in the north and center of the continent. The plan cost billions of dollars and decades of work. In fact, the war against the worm never really ended, but was pushed down to Panama. There, one of the key control measures has been a center that produces sterile male C. hominivorax flies, which is run by the joint Panama–United States Commission for the Eradication and Prevention of Screwworm. Since females mate only once in their lifetime, sex with a sterile male leaves them with no offspring, suppressing insect numbers in the area and creating a biological barrier against the flies moving north.The sterile-insect technique is as complicated as it sounds: irradiate the males so that they cannot reproduce, but not so much that can’t copulate with females. Millions of flies have to be produced and released from airplanes. And all in Panama.For the United States, protecting hundreds of kilometers in the Darien is cheaper than controlling its 3,152-kilometer border with Mexico. Building a biological barrier across the Darien Gap costs $15 million a year, but collectively saves much more for the continent’s ranchers to the north—the USDA estimates the US cattle industry alone benefits by more than $900 million a year. Up until now it’s been a small cost: since 1966, the US has been free of the worm, with sterilized male flies helping keep things that way from 2006 onward.But the line of defense seems to be weakening. Since 2022, fertile flies have been flying over Central America, forcing countries to reactivate control measures. Faced with signs that the biological barrier in Panama is breaking, Honduras decided to also establish a sterile-fly dispersal center. To date it has released 6 million flies and plans to release up to 84 million more. The strategy is effective and necessary, says Duchez, but he warns that it will not be enough if Mexico doesn’t close its border to illegal trade.What’s driving these moves is economic concern. Although cows do not usually die from screwworm, they are so weakened by infections that they stop gaining weight and producing milk. Recovery takes weeks. For farmers, this means additional costs: paying specialized personnel to care for the sick animals, buying medicine, and keeping cattle for longer, until it is safe to sell them.This is partly why Mexico decided it needed inspection points, where trained dogs sniff out worms in cattle. Central American countries have also set up control sites and farm visits, and governments across Mexico and Central America have launched information campaigns on how to detect and report cases. Among the most important recommendations are to check animals daily for worms, treat any wounds or easily infected areas—such as calf navels or where animals have been dehorned—and to transport only healthy animals without lacerations.Decades ago all of this would have been second nature. But because control measures have been so effective over the last half a century, today’s ranchers are unfamiliar with how to identify and treat screwworm infestations. “More than 50 years ago, those who dealt with the worm knew how it hid—even recognized its smell,” says Duchez. “Today, we are all in the process of learning.”This story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",
