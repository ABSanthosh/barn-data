Credit: Dr. Atsuko Nishigaki Dr. Atsuko Nishigaki and their research team from Toho University, discovered that the marine worm Marphysa sp. E, an annelid living in the tidal flat sediments of Tokyo Bay, rapidly decreased the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are carcinogenic environmental pollutants, by ingesting and excreting organic-rich reduced mud containing high concentrations of PAHs. The PAH concentration was halved within two hours. The study is published in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin. Benthic organisms living in tidal flat sediments are believed to contribute to material circulation in sediment environments by burrowing and feeding. A previous study reported that the feces of the annelid Marphysa sp. E , which resides in the tidal flat sediments of Tokyo Bay, contained high concentrations of PAHs that were halved within two hours of excretion. The study findings also revealed that the PAHs in the worms' feces originated from reduced organic mud scattered in tidal flat sediments. Marphysa sp. E selectively ingested and excreted this reduced organic mud, which contained high concentrations of PAHs. The halving of the PAH concentration observed in worm feces within two hours was extremely rapid compared to the general half-life of PAHs in sediments, which ranges from several weeks to several months. However, whether this degradation activity could be attributed to the passage of the reduced organic mud through the digestive tract of Marphysa sp. E or if the reduced mud itself had degradation activity remained unclear.

DOI: 10.2108/zs230020 Changes in the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in fecal pellets of Marphysa sp. E and reduced mud. Credit: Atsuko Nishigaki In this study, they examined the time-course changes in PAH concentrations in feces and reduced organic mud using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), followed by a statistical analysis. The results showed that such a rapid decrease in the PAH concentration did not occur in the reduced mud itself; rather, it occurred when the mud passed through the digestive tract of Marphysa sp. E. Based on these findings, the team concluded that Marphysa sp. E contributes to the environmental purification of Tokyo Bay by ingesting and excreting reduced organic mud containing high concentrations of PAHs.
