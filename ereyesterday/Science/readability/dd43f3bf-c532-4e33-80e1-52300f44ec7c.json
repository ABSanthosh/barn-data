  "description": "A study by researchers at the Interuniversity Institute of Bioinformatics in Brussels, the Structural Biology research group at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, and IBiTech–BioMMedA Group of Ghent University reveals how a key blood protein involved in inflammation and cancer—alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP)—behaves in complex and surprising ways. The findings illustrate the limits of even the most powerful AI tools in understanding these dynamic biological processes.",
