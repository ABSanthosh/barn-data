  "text": "In February, farmers sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture for removing data related to climate change.

Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, wrote to Judge Margaret M. Garnett that he was representing the Agriculture Department in the lawsuit, and that the department had already begun restoring the pages and interactive tools described in the lawsuit. He said the department “expects to substantially complete the restoration process in approximately two weeks.” Every dataset and study taken down, because it referenced keywords someone didn’t like, should come back.",
