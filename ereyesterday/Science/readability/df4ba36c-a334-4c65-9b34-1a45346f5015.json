  "description": "As civilizations become more and more advanced, their power needs also increase. It's likely that an advanced civilization might need so much power that they enclose their host star in solar energy-collecting satellites. These Dyson swarms will trap heat so any planets within the sphere are likely to experience a temperature increase. A new paper explores this and concludes that a complete Dyson swarm outside the orbit of Earth would raise our temperature by 140 K.",
