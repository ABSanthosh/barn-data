  "text": "Credit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain An in-depth exploration of the psychology of sports fandom has revealed striking similarities between the neurological and psychological patterns of devoted sports fans and religious dedication. These similarities are explored in a new book, \"The Psychology of Sports Fans,\" which demonstrates how, for nearly 5 billion people globally, sport fulfills fundamental psychological needs for belonging, identity, and meaning. The comprehensive analysis shows that sports fandom stems from evolutionarily ingrained tendencies which enhance social unity and therefore survival. Professor Aaron C. T. Smith explains, \"Our minds possess an incredible ability to believe; an ability that has been crucial for survival throughout human history. Now, like a muscle that's been trained to the extreme, we can't resist flexing our beliefs. Investing in certain beliefs, particularly those associated sports and players, brings us significant personal and social rewards.\" From Japanese baseball to New Zealand rugby, the psychological phenomenon is not unique to any one culture or nation, Smith argues, but creates powerful emotional connections that bind communities together globally. Cognitive bias and emotions The psychological underpinnings of sports fandom and religious devotion involve specific cognitive biases that strengthen emotional connections and allow for an \"automatic\" response even during heightened emotional circumstances. These include the optimism bias, which allows a tendency to expect positive outcomes despite realistic odds, or confirmation bias—a tendency to prioritize information that confirms fans' pre-existing beliefs. Smith also draws parallels between the emotional intensity of sports fandom and religious faith. Both experiences rely on something psychologists call \"superordinate ideologies,\" where belief systems become part of a core identity. For sports fans, allegiance becomes more than a pastime, Smith suggests, it transforms into a commitment that defies rational analysis. \"Supporting a team feels like a personal victory or defeat.\" Neurological patterns and heuristics Neurological patterns also play a role in sustaining connections, or maintaining \"faith.\" Emotional moments in sports, whether triumphs or heartbreaks, are etched into memory with vivid intensity, creating lasting touchstones which shape future experiences. The book cites the example of French football fans who vividly recall the 1998 FIFA World Cup win as a national high point, even decades later. Such memories are selectively recalled to align with beliefs, preserving their emotional investment and reinforcing their faith in their teams—as Smith explains, \"Memory becomes part of the mental scaffolding that supports sports faith.\" Smith further explores the concept of \"partitioned reality,\" where fans create a mental space for sports that is separate from other areas of life. This cognitive mechanism allows fans to suspend disbelief and embrace narratives that provide meaning and excitement, even if they defy logic. Similar to religious devotion, Smith suggests, sports fandom offers a controlled setting for confronting intense emotions like hope, disappointment, building resilience and reinforcing loyalty. \"Fans learn to cope with the highs and lows of their team's performance, experiencing vicarious resilience that strengthens their bond,\" he explains. Psychological defenses Psychological defenses, such as heuristics, also help to maintain beliefs. These mental shortcuts simplify complex scenarios, allowing fans to rationalize setbacks without re-evaluating their core beliefs. For instance, fans of historically successful teams might attribute losses to external factors like bad refereeing or rebuilding periods, rather than questioning their team's abilities. \"Heuristics act as cognitive guardrails, stabilizing fans' beliefs and protecting their emotional investment,\" Smith explains. The communal nature of sports fandom amplifies its emotional impact, much like religious gatherings. Shared experiences, whether in stadiums, living rooms, or online forums, create bonds that deepen fans' connection to each other and to their chosen teams or athletes. The book presents the universal appeal of sports faith as a reflection of humanity's inherent, tribalistic need for belonging and emotional resilience. Smith concludes, \"Fans don't just support a team; they believe in it. They have faith in the athletes who represent them, in the colors they wear, and in the history they honor.\" More information: Aaron C.T. Smith, The Psychology of Sports Fans (2025).
