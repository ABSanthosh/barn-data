  "description": "The year-round sea ice in the Arctic is melting and has shrunk by nearly 40 percent over the past four decades. Geoengineering companies such as Real Ice are betting big on refreezing it. That may sound ridiculous, impractical or risky—but proponents say we have to try. The U.K. government seems to agree, investing millions into experimental approaches such as Real Ice’s. Pulitzer Center Ocean Reporting Fellow Alec Luhn is taking us with him to the Arctic to see what it takes to freeze sea ice in the already freezing cold. Recommended reading: Read Luhn’s feature in the June 2025 issue of SciAm, which will be released on May 20: https://www.scientificamerican.com/author/alec-luhn/ Follow Luhn on Instagram @alecluhn_ and BlueSky @alecluhn.bsky.social U.K. Funds Geoengineering Experiments as Global Controversy Grows https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/u-k-funds-geoengineering-experiments-as-global-controversy-grows/  Geoengineering Wins Reluctant Interest from Scientists as Earth’s Climate Unravels https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/geoengineering-wins-reluctant-interest-from-scientists-as-earths-climate/  Tell us what you think!
