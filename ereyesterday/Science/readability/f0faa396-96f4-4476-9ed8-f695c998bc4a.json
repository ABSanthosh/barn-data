Drone owners are supposed to register craft that weigh more than 0.55 pound with the FAA. For recreational flyers, however, the agency doesn’t require every individual craft to be registered, leading to inconsistencies and uncertainties in tallies of these vehicles in particular.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

People flying drones for other purposes—including commercial reasons—are required to become “certificated remote pilots” with the agency.Based on 2023 data, the agency forecast 2024 would see some 1.8 million recreational drones flying in the U.S. In the same report, the agency forecast that nearly one million commercial drones would be in operation this year.The drones reported over New Jersey appear to be relatively large, potentially belonging to the FAA’s larger class of such vehicles that weigh more than 55 pounds. (This is the agency’s only size-related division in its monitoring of drones.) These large drones are much less common than their smaller brethren, with perhaps 2,300 of them flying by the end of 2023. Regardless of size, drones are expected to become ever more common in the coming years. As numbers of these vehicles have increased in the past decade, the agency has worked to regulate them and their impacts on airports and commercial airplanes in particular.The U.S. is also home to military drones—about 11,000 of them, according to an undated Department of Defense webpage. That said, in a recent press briefing, a Pentagon official confirmed that the sighted activities had not involved U.S. military drones. She also said they are not currently believed to be the work of “a foreign entity.”",
