Five good SRBs.” “And liftoff of the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, carrying satellites for Amazon’s Project Kuiper internet constellation, marking the start of a new chapter in low Earth orbit satellite connectivity.” And we’ve completed our pitch program. Engine operating parameters continue to look good. And we’ve successfully completed our roll program. Hydraulics continue to operate nominally. And we have good indication of jettison of all five SRBs. Engine continues to burn normally.”A U.L.A. Atlas V carrying 27 Amazon internet satellites lifted off on Monday.CreditCredit...Joe Skipper/ReutersApril 28, 2025Updated 8:27 p.m. ETThe battle of billionaires in space between Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk is ready to enter a new arena: satellite internet.Amazon, the company that Mr. Bezos started as an online bookseller three decades ago, is now a merchandising behemoth, the owner of the James Bond franchise, a seller of electronic gadgets like Echo smart speakers and one of the most powerful providers of cloud computing.So perhaps it is not a surprise that Amazon is now launching the first few of thousands of satellites known as Project Kuiper to provide another option for remaining connected in the modern world. The market for beaming high-speed internet to the ground from orbit is currently dominated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX rocket company, which operates a similar service, Starlink. Starlink, with thousands of satellites in orbit and more launching nearly every week, already serves several million customers around the world.On Monday, the company first 27 satellites were shipped to space. Their journey to their final orbits continues.Amazon had no immediate comment after the launch. It will take many hours, if not days, for the company to commission and establish contact with all 27 satellites and know if they are operational.When the launch and how can I watch it?The satellite lifted off on Monday at 7:01 p.m. Eastern time from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. They were carried by an Atlas V, a rocket made by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
