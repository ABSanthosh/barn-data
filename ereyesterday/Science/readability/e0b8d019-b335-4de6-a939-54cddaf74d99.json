  "text": "For BBC, Zoe Kleinman reports: Not so long ago, 23andMe was in the public eye for all the right reasons. Its famous customers included Snoop Dogg, Oprah Winfrey, Eva Longoria and Warren Buffet – and millions of users were getting unexpected and life-changing results. Some people discovered that their parents were not who they thought they were, or that they had a genetic pre-disposition to serious health conditions. Its share price rocketed to $321. Fast forward three years and that price has slumped to just under $5 – and the company is worth 2% of what it once was. What went wrong? It’s mostly wishful thinking on my part, but maybe people started to feel strange about sending their DNA to a company they didn’t know that much about.",
