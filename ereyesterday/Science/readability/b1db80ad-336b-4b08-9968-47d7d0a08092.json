  "text": "Whooping Cough Kills Two Babies as Cases SoarThe bacterial infection pertussis has sparked an uptick in cases nationwide and has caused two deaths in Louisiana Lorena Garibo/Getty ImagesTwo infants have died of whooping cough in Louisiana in the past six months, according to the surgeon general of the state’s health department. The deaths from this vaccine-preventable illness are the first to occur in Louisiana since 2018.There have been 110 cases of whooping cough in the state so far this year, compared with 154 cases in all of last year, CNN reported. Cases have been rising throughout the U.S. after they dropped dramatically during the COVID pandemic. There were 35,000 cases in the country last year—higher than any year since 2012.The spike may have been driven by declining vaccination rates for childhood diseases. Two months ago Louisiana’s health department said it would no longer promote vaccination. Similar declines may be behind the growing measles outbreak in Texas and neighboring states.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

It is extremely contagious, and symptoms can last for months. The bacteria attach to tiny, hairlike structures in the lungs called cilia, which help sweep the lungs clear of mucus and irritants. There the bacteria secrete toxins that damage the cilia and cause the airways to swell.3D illustration of a group of aerobic, gram-negative, Bordetella pertussis bacteria.imageBROKER/Stocktrek Images/Getty ImagesWhat are the symptoms?Early symptoms of whooping cough can resemble those of a common cold. A week or two later, many people start having violent coughing fits that usually last one to six weeks but can linger up to 10 weeks. People with the illness often produce a characteristic “whooping” noise as they gasp for air between coughs. The coughing can sometimes be so violent that it causes people to vomit or fracture a rib, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The disease can be especially dangerous to babies and young children, who may not cough at all but may struggle to breathe. About one in three babies with whooping cough are hospitalized. Those younger than a year old can develop apnea (potentially deadly pauses in breathing), pneumonia, convulsions and encephalopathy (brain disease). One in 100 babies hospitalized with whooping cough will die from complications of the illness.Can the disease be prevented or treated?Vaccines are effective at preventing serious cases of whooping cough, though they may not entirely prevent people from getting the disease. In the U.S. there are currently two pertussis vaccines in use, both of which also protect against diphtheria and tetanus: the DTaP vaccine is given to infants older than two months and young children, and the Tdap vaccine is used for older children and adults, including pregnant people.The CDC recommends that children get vaccinated at two months, four months, six months, 15 through 18 months and four through six years of age. Adults should get vaccinated against diphtheria and tetanus at least every 10 years, and this includes protection against pertussis if the DTaP or Tdap vaccine is given. Though there’s no official recommendation to get revaccinated for whooping cough specifically, some evidence suggests pertussis immunity only lasts about six years. Pregnant people should get the Tdap vaccine in their third trimester to provide protection to their baby prior to birth.Whooping cough can be treated with antibiotics, but they are most effective if they are given early, before coughing fits have begun. After three weeks of infection, the drugs are unlikely to help because the body has cleared the bacteria, and the lingering cough is caused by airway damage. Cough medicines aren’t usually effective either.Most infections can be treated at home, but some may require hospitalization. Treatment consists of keeping airways clear and administering oxygen or fluids if needed.",
