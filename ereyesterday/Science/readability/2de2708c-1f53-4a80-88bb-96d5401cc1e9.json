  "description": "Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a diverse group of synthetic chemicals, are commonly used in numerous products such as semiconductors, fire-extinguishing foams, heat-resistant, and non-stick cookware. PFAS possess remarkable resistance to heat, oil, grease, and water that can be attributed to the strong chemical bonds between the atoms. However, the major drawback of the exceptional resistance is that PFAS are highly persistent in the environment, earning the nickname \"forever chemicals.\"",
