This is where multiple planets line up next to each other.On January 21, six planets—Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—will be visible simultaneously in the sky, and their alignment will be easily visible from almost all parts of the globe. But if you miss the chance to observe the night sky on January 21, don’t worry: There is plenty of time to see this planetary parade.The alignment will be visible for about a month, until mid to late February. The planets’ positions will, however, shift over this time, so their positions on January 21 will not be the same as their positions in late February.While conjunctions of two planets are somewhat common, alignments of five or more are quite rare. There will be two more planetary alignments featuring five or more planets this year, but after that, the next alignment of five or more planets won’t happen until 2040.Here’s everything you need to know to see this planetary alignment.How to WatchTo get the best view, allow 20 to 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark. You’ll want to see this planetary alignment after the sun has set and from a location far away from artificial light, which makes it hard to see objects in the night sky.Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, Saturn, and Venus will appear in an arc from east to west. You can spot four of these planets with your naked eyes; however, two of them—Uranus and Neptune—require a good pair of high-powered binoculars or a backyard telescope. Exactly where in the night sky to look for each planet on the 21st is outlined below, but if you’re not sure how to find them, don’t worry—apps like Stellarium can help you easily locate the planets and other celestial objects.When to WatchThe best time to view the planets is shortly after sunset, because three of them—Venus, Saturn, and Neptune—set between approximately 9 and 10:30 pm local time. Note that the exact time each planet rises and sets will vary slightly according to your location on Earth; you can use a website like Time and Date to find the exact timings for where you are.It’s best to start skywatching earlier in the evening if you can, because Venus, Saturn, and Neptune will move lower toward the horizon before setting, and so will become more and more difficult to see as the evening goes on.MarsOn January 21, Mars will be in the east, directly under the constellation Gemini. Mars has just reached opposition—meaning the Earth is directly between it and the sun—so the Red Planet will appear at its biggest and brightest and will be visible all night.Mars is easily visible to the naked eye. But if you use a backyard telescope, you’ll be able to see its north polar ice cap, which spans more than 600 miles, and the Vallis Marineris, the largest canyon in the solar system, which runs along Mars’ equator and is over 1,800 miles long.JupiterJupiter will be to the west of Mars, in the constellation Taurus. Jupiter is easily visible to the naked eye. However, a pair of high-powered binoculars will allow you to see Jupiter’s moons and possibly its cloud bands.A backyard telescope will allow you to see the giant planet in even greater detail. Look for Jupiter’s cloud bands and its stunning Red Spot, an anticyclone that is over 10,000 miles wide—1.3 times the width of Earth. The Red Spot isn’t always visible from Earth, because Jupiter’s days are about 10 hours long, meaning the storm spends a sizable portion of time facing away from Earth on a lot of nights. You can use this calculator from Sky \u0026 Telescope to see when it might be visible from your location.Jupiter will be visible for most of the night: It rises in the mid to late afternoon on January 21 and sets between about 3 and 5 am on January 22, depending on your exact location.UranusOn the 21st, Uranus will be about 50 degrees to the west of Jupiter and slightly below it. Uranus will appear to be near the Pleiades, a bright star cluster that is visible to the naked eye.You will need a pair of high-powered binoculars or a backyard telescope to see Uranus, as it’s too dim to easily see with the naked eye. Through such equipment, Uranus looks like a star with a pale blue tint. Although Uranus has rings, they are too faint to see, even with viewing equipment. However, if you have a powerful backyard telescope, you could potentially see its moons.",
