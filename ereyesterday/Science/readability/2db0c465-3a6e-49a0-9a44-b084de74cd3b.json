  "text": "A Simple Challenge A previous article of mine, A Simple Challenge For Drs. Vinay Prasad and Tracy Hoeg: Denounce Robert Kennedy Jr. For Promoting The Movie Vaxxed 3: Authorized to Kill, issued a very simple challenge to two doctors. RFK Jr. has spread rank anti-vaccine disinformation for decades, and he wants to do to the U.S. what he did in Samoa. Just because he encourages healthy eating and exercise does not mean RFK Jr. harmless. He is very dangerous and he should be treated that way. Doctors who sanewashed his disinformation aren’t just playing with fire, they are knowingly fanning the flames, and they are doing so at a dangerous moment. Anti-vaxxers are winning. According to the article Trump Selects Dave Weldon, Former Congressman With Ties to Vaccine Critics, to Lead CDC: Weldon has a history of backing controversial and, in the views of most scientists, discredited ideas that linked childhood vaccines with increasing rates of autism. Del Bigtree, a prominent anti-vaccine activist who worked on RFK Jr.’s campaign, applauded the selection of Weldon on X. Meanwhile, science and children’s health are losing. Vaccine rates are falling and diseases are spreading. This isn’t a game. It all has the potential to get much worse. It should not be hard for “pro-vaccine” doctors to denounce RFK Jr., and I would have a hard time respecting any doctor who couldn’t pass this simple challenge. Any doctor who is unable to condemn RFK Jr. should engage in some seriously reflection on the choices that led to their current situation. Drs. Prasad and Hoeg have not denounced RFK Jr. for promoting movies such as Vaxxed 3: Authorized to Kill and Plandemic. In fact, Drs. Prasad and Hoeg have repeatedly praised him. They told the world that RFK Jr. was wise and trustworthy and powerful people believed them. They own everything that he does for the next four years. Unabashedly Pro-Vaccine I am curious if their collaborator at Sensible Medicine, a monetized Substack, Dr. Adam Cifu can pass my simple challenge. Can Dr. Cifu denounce Vaxxed 3: Authorized to Kill? Dr. Cifu once described himself “unabashedly pro-vaccine.” If this is truly the case, he should have no problem condemning RFK Jr. not just for showing Vaxxed 3: Authorized to Kill, but also for what he’s already done in the real world. Why hasn’t he done so already? Doctors’ silence on the risk of RFK Jr. also sent a message that he’s he’s not that risky at after all. If Dr. Cifu passes my simple challenge and condemns RFK Jr. for all this, perhaps he can then explain why he continues to legitimize Sensible Medicine. Dr. Cifu warned us of “motivating biases” in his essay The Case for Being a Medical Conservative, and I think that’s a good idea. It seems to me that any doctor who is unabashedly pro-vaccine would recoil at profiting from a blog that told the world that RFK Jr. was nothing to worry about and someone to love. The man’s got a body count. I am unabashedly pro-vaccine and we don’t have paying customers to please here at Science Based Medicine. As such, I can say obvious things. Doctors who downplay RFK Jr.’s threat are spreading dangerous disinformation. Any doctor who enabled his rise in any way is anti-vaccine no matter how they describe themselves.
