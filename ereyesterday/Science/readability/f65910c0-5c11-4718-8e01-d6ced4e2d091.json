  "description": "Award-winning author and investigative journalist Alice Driver joins me to discuss her powerful new book, Life and Death of the American Worker. Her investigation exposes the deeply unethical practices within the meatpacking industry in the United States. For Alice, this story is personal. She grew up in Arkansas, one of the country’s poorest states and home to Tyson Foods, the largest meatpacking plant in America. We delve into the harsh realities faced by the industry’s workforce, many of whom are undocumented immigrants, with estimates suggesting that up to 30% of the labor force lacks legal status. Our conversation explores the severe health consequences these workers endure and the broader implications for workers’ rights in America today.
