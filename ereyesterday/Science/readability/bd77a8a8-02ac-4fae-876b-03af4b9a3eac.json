  "text": "Nov 12, 2024 Bluesky, maybe best pitched as a place for those who liked Twitter and Google Reader more than a decade ago, is having a moment right now. You can find me there. It’s always hard for these things to maintain momentum, but we’ll see. The shift feels real this time.

Sky Follower Bridge is a useful plugin for Chrome and Firefox to find the people you used to follow on X. Hope to see you there.",
