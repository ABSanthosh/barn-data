  "text": "One by one, Ukrainian villagers gathered round and held their smartphones out to catch the signal. A nearby Starlink terminal, a small, square-shaped panel facing the sky, was about to beam their voices to a satellite in low Earth orbit, which in turn would relay their calls to relatives hundreds or thousands of kilometers away.Here, close to the front line in Ukraine’s northeastern provinces, where mobile phone networks are down, you don’t get to make that connection very often, to send that picture that shows you are still OK. Phones rang, people on the other end picked up, conversations—and tears—flowed.“I don’t think it can be exaggerated how big a difference it makes to people’s lives. For them to be able to have that moment of normality,” says Ada Wordsworth, director of KHARPP, a charity predominantly working to rebuild homes in Ukraine, who brought the Starlink terminal to this village with her team in 2023.KHARPP has paid for and deployed six Starlink terminals in Ukraine during the past two years. They have connected people displaced by the war, helped a kindergarten offer online English lessons to children, and allowed doctors to access patients’ medical records. But Wordsworth has no plans to buy any more. “It’s not something that makes sense to invest in,” she explains. “They might be switched off.”KHARPPIn late February, reports suggested that US officials had threatened to cut Ukraine off from Starlink during negotiations over a deal regarding access to Ukraine’s mineral resources. Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX, the company that operates Starlink, has since denied those reports. Nevertheless, European countries are now considering what alternatives they might deploy in Ukraine. Alongside this, the European Union is closing in on an agreement to massively increase defense spending in the wake of the US withdrawing military aid to Ukraine.It was apparent early on in the war that Ukraine had become highly dependent on Starlink, and Ukrainians have long wondered whether they might get booted off the service, especially given the notorious whims of Musk. SpaceX’s chief executive is now positioned at the heart of the new Trump administration, which says it is trying to force an end to fighting between Russia and Ukraine.Starlink has supported Ukrainian military and civilian activities ever since Russia invaded in early 2022. With many fixed-line and mobile networks destroyed in the conflict, Starlink enables soldiers to relay footage from the battlefield and to coordinate maneuvers, artillery fire, or drone attacks. Military personnel also have access to the encrypted Starshield network, a special version of Starlink that is especially difficult to jam or intercept.“It’s been a critical technology, perhaps game-changing, in creating much more robust and survivable battlefield communications and the type of high-bandwidth connectivity that was typically lacking in the battlefield,” says Chris Quilty, co-chief executive and president at Quilty Analytics, a Florida-based space and communications research firm.Ukraine has come up with a range of telecommunications solutions during the war, including fiber-optic tethered drones, invulnerable to jamming, and mobile phones hoisted on 6 foot poles to detect incoming enemy drones and missiles. But Starlink is arguably at the heart of the country’s communications arsenal.“Starlink at the start of the war was transformative. Getting rid of it now would be absolutely tragic,” says Wordsworth. “I can’t imagine what these communities would do; they’d be completely cut off,” she says of those using the terminals provided by KHARPP. She adds that the areas where she and her colleagues work have become increasingly targeted by Russian drones and glide bombs in recent weeks, heightening the dangers faced by local people. Wordsworth says she is “pessimistic” about what will happen next.SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED.KHARPPFor years, Ukrainian officials have hinted that they are working on Starlink alternatives. But the truth is, there aren’t many options on the table.The one most discussed is OneWeb, a satellite communications network owned by Eutelsat, a satellite operator in France. Like Starlink, this network relies on small, ground-based terminals, and its total constellation includes around 630 low-Earth-orbit satellites, which offer very high-speed connectivity and lower latency than satellites that orbit at higher altitudes.Joanna Darlington, a spokeswoman for Eutelsat, says that OneWeb offers Europe-wide coverage and that the technology is already deployed in Ukraine to some extent, though she declined to share details. Still, there are more than 40,000 Starlink terminals in Ukraine, according to reports, so replacing that network with OneWeb alternatives cannot be done overnight. “It’s possible but it’s not instant coffee,” says Darlington. (The firm claims Eutelsat’s OneWeb coverage in Europe rivals Starlink already.)While Starlink terminals are made by SpaceX, OneWeb terminals are supplied by third-party companies. “We have stocks of terminals that we could deploy,” stresses Darlington, though she adds, “somebody has to pay for it.”Poland and USAID, among others, have helped to fund Ukraine’s use of the Starlink network to date. Eutelsat is currently in talks with the European Union over a possible scaling up of OneWeb in Ukraine.While OneWeb has promise, it’s difficult to see how Ukrainians, especially in battlefield conditions, might rely on it in the same way as Starlink, says Barry Evans, professor of information systems engineering at the University of Surrey.“We’ve got one [OneWeb terminal] at the university, and it’s quite a complicated process in terms of actually getting connected and on-boarded,” he says. The terminals tend to be bulkier than Starlink’s and potentially harder to move quickly in a conflict zone, he adds, suggesting that OneWeb terminals might be better deployed at fixed locations on buildings, for example.“The other challenge is the terminals for OneWeb cost thousands of dollars instead of hundreds of dollars [for Starlink],” says Quilty. And yet, OneWeb is currently the “only option” readily available to Ukraine as an alternative, he adds.That might change eventually. Amazon’s Project Kuiper, a rival to Starlink, could launch its first satellites later this year. Eventually, Project Kuiper will have more than 3,000 satellites. But, Evans notes, Amazon is also a US company. If the US government puts pressure on domestic firms to walk away from Ukraine, then Project Kuiper might not be of much use in the near term.The European Union is working on its own constellation of communications satellites, called IRIS2. But they might not become operational until 2030 and will only feature around 300 medium- and low-Earth-orbit satellites. The size of a satellite constellation affects the connection speeds and coverage that it offers. Starlink, for example, already has more than 7,000 satellites in orbit, though the network might need around 10,000 in total before its coverage becomes truly global. SpaceX has suggested it might launch more than 40,000 satellites, if granted authorization to do so by the UN’s International Telecommunication Union.Andrew Cavalier, space tech analyst at ABI Research, a tech intelligence firm, says he is skeptical that SpaceX would block Ukrainians from accessing Starlink, but current doubts over SpaceX’s reliability are a “wake-up call” for countries using the service, who may now increasingly invest in developing their own, sovereign, satellite communications networks. Evans agrees. “The Ukrainian situation has brought it a little bit to the fore,” he says. “People are very worried about the dominance that Starlink has got.”In Ukraine, Ada Wordsworth says she is not aware of any alternative that could easily take the place of Starlink.With Russia seemingly emboldened of late, she says a general feeling of hopelessness is setting in among locals who have returned home to villages near the front line. Many have nowhere else to go.When asked what she would say to Elon Musk, she replies: “This isn’t a game. This isn’t a decision to be taken out of bitterness or out of spite, or some warped sense of power. This is real people’s lives.”",

But they might not become operational until 2030 and will only feature around 300 medium- and low-Earth-orbit satellites.

Evans agrees. “The Ukrainian situation has brought it a little bit to the fore,” he says. “People are very worried about the dominance that Starlink has got.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Ukraine, Ada Wordsworth says she is not aware of any alternative that could easily take the place of Starlink.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Russia seemingly emboldened of late, she says a general feeling of hopelessness is setting in among locals who have returned home to villages near the front line.
