Please also consider subscribing to WIREDLet’s face it—2024 has felt at times like a relentless conveyor belt of doom. The climate crisis is still gaining momentum, COP underlined the lack of consensus on what to do about it, and attempts to create a plastics treaty failed. Political violence rose to the surface in the US, and there was an election result that foretells four years of chaos and persecution for many. And war, conflict, and violence continue to afflict millions worldwide, from the DRC to South Sudan, Haiti to Yemen, Ukraine to Gaza.But in the midst of the darkness, there were some bright rays of light. Scientists made big strides in countering some of the greatest health problems faced by humanity. Efforts to fight climate change have pressed on. And a cute baby hippo bit her zookeeper’s knee in a fit of childish rage, launching a thousand memes. Here’s our rundown of the best news to come out of 2024.Routine Childhood Vaccination Against Malaria BeganMalaria has proven a stubborn foe—the quest to produce a vaccine against it began more than a century ago. Now, two are available, and in early 2024, the world’s first routine childhood immunization campaign against malaria began in Cameroon. The disease kills more than half a million people worldwide every year, but this could be the starting point for bringing this number down significantly.

Researchers hope these rock samples will help reveal how the moon, and other planets, evolved.

That’s an ambitious goal, but SpaceX made great progress toward it this year. The Starship program completed a number of test flights, the most eye-catching being the fifth test, in October, which saw the giant craft launch successfully and its booster return to and land on its launch tower. It was an exhilarating spectacle—and potentially a historic milestone in the history of interplanetary travel.

When these reach Earth they create auroras, and bigger waves result in the northern and southern lights being visible at latitudes far from our planet’s poles. With the peak of solar maximum not arriving until the middle of next year, we can expect further vivid and widespread auroras for some more time yet.

Making one remains fiendishly difficult—the virus mutates rapidly, meaning it can quickly outmaneuver immune defenses. But, for the first time, researchers have successfully managed to use an experimental vaccine to stimulate broadly neutralizing antibodies against many forms of the virus, paving the way for a potential vaccine. The next step is to get the human body to produce these antibodies in greater quantities.

Named Valeriana, the city is believed to have been founded before 150 AD. The first person to notice the city’s existence was Luke Auld-Thomas, a PhD student at Tulane University in Louisiana, USA. Hear from Luke about making the discovery on WIRED.The UK Shut Off Its Last Coal Power StationFor the first time since 1882, the United Kingdom has no coal-fired power plants generating electricity, becoming the first country in the G7 to move fully away from coal power. A number of factors combined to bring about the end of coal power in Britain: the growth of natural gas-powered plants and renewables, pollution controls, carbon pricing, and the UK government’s goal to hit net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

However, these record-breaking cells are currently made in laboratories and are smaller than a postage stamp. Translating such high performance to meter-square areas remains a vast challenge.

In recent years LA has been preparing for more extreme rainfall by transforming into a “sponge city,” replacing impermeable surfaces, like concrete, with permeable ones, like dirt and plants. This avoids flash flooding while at the same time channeling water into the region’s aquifers, to help in times of drought. This is something more and more cities will need to do as the world warms.

After receiving the implant as part of a clinical trial, some participants could see well enough to read from a book, play cards, or fill in a crossword puzzle despite being legally blind.

In February, the Irvine, California–based biotech company announced results from a small, early-stage trial showing that 24 hours after taking the drug, it can kill ticks on people, with the effects lasting for up to 30 days.

Recent studies have also hinted at their potential to treat addiction and even slow the cognitive decline that comes with dementia. Scientists are still working out exactly why they seem to have these positive effects.

Only a handful of football players have used the caps in NFL games so far, but with the health impacts of concussion under the spotlight, expect to see them—or even more effective successors—become gradually more and more common.

EV sales have slowed in Europe but are surging in China, and globally, year-on-year growth of EVs in 2024 was about 25 percent, according to the consultancy firm Rho Motion.

Observers have been quick to point to the influence of Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound, and other GLP-1 drugs, but researchers caution that Covid-19 may also have played a role—as it disproportionately killed Americans with obesity.

It turns out the culprit is a genetic variant on cats’ X chromosome. The research also explains why tortoiseshell and calico cats tend to be females.

The sail ship traveled at an average speed of 10 knots (18.5 km/h)—slower than fossil-fuel-powered ships, which average 14 to 25 knots (25 to 46 km/h)—but it eliminated between 150 and 200 metric tons of CO2 emissions on its journey. It’s estimated that shipping produces 900 million tons of CO2 each year—roughly 3 percent of global emissions.

The cathedral boasts a new altar and a dazzling ivory-colored interior. Repair works are continuing on the exterior of the building.

They remained high for several years, before beginning to fall, and are now projected to return to pre-2020 levels for the first time. Data suggests that male unemployment and school closures, particularly in low-income neighborhoods, as a result of the pandemic were the key drivers of the rise in violence.

Warranties typically cover EV batteries for eight years, but they look like they might last for up to 20. But right now it is hard to be certain—there are very few EVs on the road that are even a decade old.

Most people would just admit defeat, but Jayasimha grabbed two friends, some foil, and a microwave, and set to work building a homemade device to get rid of the geolocation restrictions.

Since being revealed to the public on July 25 at Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand, Moo Deng (which translates as “Bouncy Pork”) has become one of the most recognizable faces of the internet. Sure, she’s cute. But what’s propelled her to stardom is her sassy personality: sitting in her mom’s food bowl, biting her zookeeper, charging around her enclosure, and screaming. In 2024, lots of people could relate. Read more at The New York Times.",
