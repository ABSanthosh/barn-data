For the Pudding, Fox Meyer with Jan Diehm analyzed wine price and quality to find out. Most animal categories followed a similar curve, but these guys tended to avoid the bottom right corner. This means very few bottles with frogs, snakes or lizards are good deals, and should be avoided if that’s your priority. I’m going to need some real-world tests to verify.",
