  "description": "A Rice University study sheds light on the extraordinary evolution of anglerfish, a group of deep-sea dwellers whose bizarre adaptations have captivated scientists and the public alike. The research, published in Nature Ecology \u0026 Evolution, uncovers how these enigmatic creatures defied the odds to diversify in the harsh, resource-poor environment of the bathypelagic zoneâ€”part of the open ocean that extends from 3,300 to 13,000 feet below the ocean's surface.",
