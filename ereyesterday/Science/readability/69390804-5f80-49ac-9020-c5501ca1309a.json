The auction house had last month projected an estimated value of $4 million to $6 million for the juvenile Ceratosaurus, a carnivorous reptile that prowled North America 150 million years ago.The company announced the sale on its X account. The sale price followed eye-watering sums paid for dinosaur skeletons in the public market in 2020 and 2024.The ceratosaur roamed the floodplains of what is now the American West about 90 million years before non-avian dinosaurs were driven to extinction. It is distinguished by its thin nasal horn and dagger-like teeth. The auctioned specimen was discovered by private fossil prospectors in 1996 near Bone Cabin Quarry, Wyo., and is only the fourth Ceratosaurus skeleton ever found. It is also the only juvenile, with the mounted skeleton standing just over six feet tall and nearly 11 feet long. A notable selling point was its complete, delicately preserved skull.The ceratosaur had a winding road to the auction block. First acquired by the Museum of Ancient Life in Utah, it remained as an unmounted public display until 2024. The nonprofit museum then removed it from its collection and sold it to Brock Sisson, a former employee who is now a commercial paleontologist. His company mounted it and brought it to Sotheby’s for auction.Mr. Sisson did not reply to a request for comment.The bidding for the ceratosaur lasted six minutes and involved six bidders competing in the room, online, and over the phone, said Cassandra Hatton, vice chairman and global head of science and natural history at Sotheby’s. The final price climbed over seven times its low estimate before selling to a client on the phone. Sotheby’s has yet to disclose the identity of the winning bidder.The dinosaur’s price made it the third-most-expensive fossil to sell at auction. The high-water mark was set last year by Sotheby’s sale of the stegosaur “Apex,” which sold to the hedge fund billionaire Kenneth Griffin for $44.6 million. Earlier in 2020, “Stan,” a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton, sold at Christie’s for $31.8 million.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
