It continues to garner bipartisan support and public approval.The Biden administration has largely sustained the directions set during the Trump administration. NASA is still working to send astronauts back to the moon. The Space Force has become an established branch of the military. SpaceX remains the domineering entity in governmental spaceflight, even as its owner, Elon Musk, has become a strident advocate of a second Trump presidency.One sign of continuity in space policy is that Mr. Biden even set up a space council. Over the past 50 years, only three presidents — George H.W. Bush, Donald J. Trump and Mr. Biden — thought that space issues were weighty enough to warrant setting up a White House-level body to handle them.While Ms. Harris has not made major shifts, she has added personal touches to U.S. space policy, including placing a greater emphasis on international diplomacy and highlighting how space technology can be employed to improve life on Earth.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
