Mandel Ngan - Pool/Getty ImagesCLIMATEWIRE | President Joe Biden used the first half of his 17-minute farewell address Wednesday night to tout his achievements over the past four years, highlighting infrastructure and climate legislation that created new jobs across the country.Then it got dark.Speaking from the Oval Office, Biden warned that a powerful “oligarchy” threatens U.S. democracy — and is working to diminish and destroy his climate policy. He said climate change was among the most dire threats facing the country and that he was concerned about the fate of his landmark climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The law included almost $400 billion in clean energy spending — which President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to claw back.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

But he blamed a fog of misinformation for misleading the American people. The free press was “crumbling,” he said. Social media fact-checkers have been eliminated, he said — referencing tech giant Meta's recent announcement that it would no longer use fact-checkers.“I'm equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech industrial complex that could pose real dangers for our country as well,” Biden said. “Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation, enabling the abuse of power.”Biden’s address made it clear that he is concerned his climate legacy is under threat. He oversaw the most aggressive climate plan in U.S. history — and some of its impacts, like boosting clean energy manufacturing and electric vehicles, will likely survive the Trump administration.But Biden’s climate efforts will also now face a four-year frontal assault. Trump wants to repeal or weaken as much of the Inflation Reduction Act as possible, and he’ll begin targeting regulations on fossil fuels with an expected flurry of executive orders as soon as he takes office.Gone will be the president who frequently called climate change “an existential threat.” Seated at the Resolute desk will be a president who promises to “drill, baby, drill.”Trump has promised that the government's support of EVs is now over. He will transform a White House now focused on getting all federal agencies to consider climate change into one determined to ramp up fossil fuel production as quickly as possible.And while Biden increased the number of federal employees focused on climate change, carbon emissions reductions and environmental justice, Trump’s incoming Cabinet officials have promised to purge them.In the final moments of his Oval Office speech, just days away from completing nearly a half-century in public office, Biden ended with a small note of hope.“After 50 years of public service, I give you my word, I still believe in the idea for which this nation stands, where the strengths of our institutions and the character of our people matter and must endure,” he said. “Now it's your turn to stand guard.”Reprinted from E\u0026E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC.
