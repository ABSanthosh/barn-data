The technique could help reveal the biochemistry of amber as it forms, a process that otherwise would remain hidden in the fog of prehistory.Published on Monday in the journal Scientific Reports, the results of the fast-fossilization experiment are akin to a meal made in a pressure cooker. “It’s similar to an Instapot,” said Evan Saitta, a research associate at the Field Museum in Chicago and co-author of the paper.The recipe for synthetic amber started with pine resin from the Chicago Botanic Garden. Dr. Saitta and his co-author, Thomas Kaye, an independent paleontologist, placed half-inch sediment disks in which the resin was embedded in a device Mr. Kaye built using a medical pill compressor, air canisters and other scavenged parts.By both heating and pressuring the samples, the researchers were trying to simulate diagenesis, the slow, wet physical and chemical transformation required before sediment consolidates into rock.“Diagenesis is the ultimate hurdle you need to pass to become a fossil,” Dr. Saitta said. “It’s sort of the final boss.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
