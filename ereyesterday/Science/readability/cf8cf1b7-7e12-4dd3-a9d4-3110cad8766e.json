  "text": "Experiment 1. Sample texts-Period and No Period versions. Credit: Frontiers in Psychology (2025). DOI: 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1410698 What would you think if you received this text message? \"Buy some milk\" Pretty straightforward. Nothing to bat an eye at. But what if the text read like this? \"Buy. Some. Milk.\" A little more intense, right? Does the texter need the milk immediately? Are they frustrated? According to new research from Binghamton University, State University of New York, textisms like these—such as adding a period after each word or putting each word in its own text bubble—can convey emotion and intensity. Celia Klin, a psychologist at Binghamton University, had previously published research in 2015 and 2017 on the inclusion of a period after single-word texts: okay. yup. nope. Instead of being used grammatically, to indicate that a sentence was complete, as would be the case with more formal writing, periods used after a single word in a text message were understood as being used rhetorically, to add meaning, said Klin. In a paper published in Frontiers in Psychology, Klin and former Binghamton University graduate students Rachel Poirier and Andrew Cook studied two new textisms. They asked groups of undergraduate students to examine a series of text exchanges and rate how disgusted or frustrated they believed the texter who sent them to be. The first type of textism was the inclusion of a period after each word: Yuck. get. an. exterminator. The second type of textism put each word into its own text bubble: No just go In both instances, these textisms were understood to add emotional intensity to the messages. \"Texters are much more limited than speakers in conveying important social and pragmatic information,\" said Klin. \"Textisms, such as irregular punctuation and deliberate misspellings, are sometimes used to replace the multimodal cues, such as tone of voice and gestures, that are available in spoken language. Critically, our findings indicate that the recipients of texts often interpret textisms as they were intended, as conveying emotion and intensity.\" In a spoken conversation, we expect our conversational partner's contributions to be meaningful rather than random, and Klin said that we also expect the same meaning in text messages. \"Readers assume that the decision to include a textism—such as including a period after each word or putting each word in its own text bubble—was deliberate and meaningful,\" said Klin. \"That is, they believe that the textisms were included to communicate meaning. This can be thought of with regard to the concept of 'emotion work.' Text recipients understand that the inclusion of textisms required work and assume this work was undertaken deliberately. In the case of the textisms we studied, the work was undertaken to add emotional intensity.\" Klin said that additional research is needed to investigate the range of factors that influence the comprehension of textisms. The findings might be different in more formal communicative settings, such as between an employee and a boss, for example. She also noted that this study only examined texts conveying negative emotions, and that a wider range of materials, as well as the individual characteristics of readers, should be examined. Although speculative, Klin and her colleagues conclude that both of the textisms they examined were understood by readers as a pause, perhaps mimicking the vocal prosody of a dramatic pause. \"One can imagine that the presence of a period after each word was 'heard' by readers as a staccato speech: No. Just. Stop,\" said Klin. \"The same can be argued for the second textism we examined, with words being read one at a time in individual text bubbles. Pauses in spoken language have been found to have important communicative functions. Thus, it would be unsurprising if texters have found a way to communicate pauses as well.\" More information: Rachel C. Poirier et al, Read. This.
