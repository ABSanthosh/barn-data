  "description": "In this episode, Prof. Boris Kuhlmey and Prof. Peter Tuthill join me to discuss the Toliman Mission, a space telescope project focused on detecting Earth-like exoplanets around Alpha Centauri, our nearest star system, using precise astrometric measurements. We discuss logistics, the costs involved and the success rate of such an astronomical project. Developed by a collaboration including the University of Sydney, NASA’s JPL, and Breakthrough Initiatives, it aims to launch by 2026.
