  "description": "There's a tradition around many Thanksgiving dinner tables that's as consistent as stuffing and pumpkin pie: the family stories that get told year after year. Sometimes these stories are funny; sometimes they make us roll our eyes. No matter how we feel about these tales, we rarely pause to consider how they shape who we are and how we view the world. This week, we talk to psychologist Robyn Fivush about the profound impact that family stories can have on our lives.  If you enjoyed today's conversation, here are more Hidden Brain episodes you might like:Healing 2.0: Change Your Story, Change Your Life The Story of Your LifeRewinding \u0026 RewritingThanks for listening!",
