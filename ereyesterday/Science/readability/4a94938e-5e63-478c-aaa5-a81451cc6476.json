  "text": "Maddie MolloyClimate and Science reporter, BBC NewsGetty ImagesEarly-rising UK stargazers are in for a celestial treat later this week as a partial lunar eclipse takes place just before dawn on Friday.Earth will cast its shadow over the Moon. Unlike in other parts of the world, the eclipse in the UK will only be partial but still a dramatic spectacle, weather permitting. As the Moon moves into Earth's shadow, it will gradually darken before turning a dusky red, resulting in a stunning \"blood moon\".The last total lunar eclipse in the UK occurred in 2022.When is the lunar eclipse?The penumbral phase (when the Moon first enters Earth's outer shadow) will begin at 03:57 on Friday.The partial eclipse - when the Moon starts moving into the darker part of Earth's shadow - will begin at 05:09.Lunar eclipses are visible from anywhere on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon at the time.At 06:58 the eclipse will reach its true maximum; however, in the UK, the Moon will have already set below the horizon, so we won't be able to see this.For those in North America, most of South America, and western Greenland, the eclipse will be total.\"Even if you have to get up super early to see it, I would definitely recommend that you try because seeing it in real life is really, really cool,\" says Imo Bell, astronomer at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.What is a lunar eclipse and a blood moon?A lunar eclipse happens when Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, blocking sunlight and casting a shadow on the Moon's surface.There are three main types:Total lunar eclipse – The entire Moon moves into Earth's shadow and turns red.Partial lunar eclipse – Only part of the Moon enters Earth's shadow, creating a visible dark section.Penumbral lunar eclipse – A subtle event where the Moon passes through Earth's outer shadow, causing a slight dimming.People sometimes refer to a lunar eclipse as a \"blood moon\" because of the way the Moon can turn a deep, coppery red during the eclipse.This is caused by a process known as \"Rayleigh scattering\" which also makes the sky blue and our sunsets red. It scatters more of the shorter blue wavelength light, allowing the longer red wavelength light to remain visible.During a lunar eclipse, all of the light shining onto the Moon has come through Earth's atmosphere. It's as if every sunrise and sunset in the world is projected onto the lunar surface.How to see it?To get the best view of the eclipse, head to a clear, dark location.\"My top tip would be to make sure you have a good view of the western horizon, because the Moon will be in the west and it will be setting towards the western horizon,\" advises Imo Bell of the Royal Observatory.Another top tip from Imo: it'll be dark so bring a light to help get around, but use a red torch if you can get hold of one. It helps keep your eyes adjusted to the dark. Also, of course, check the weather forecast.\"Even though some people might say it's not that unusual to get a lunar eclipse, as we can see one every few years, next time it comes around, it might be cloudy. So, if you can, definitely do get out and try and have a look,\" said Imo.The next lunar eclipse visible in the UK will be on 7 September 2025.",
