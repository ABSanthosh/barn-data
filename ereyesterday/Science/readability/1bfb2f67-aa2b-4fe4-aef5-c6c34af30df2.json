What an incredible view.SpaceX launched and returned a large rocket booster to its Texas site, catching it with mechanical arms in its first-ever “chopsticks” landing.CreditCredit...Eric Gay/Associated PressSpaceX pulled off a feat of technical wizardry on Sunday, not only flying a 233-foot rocket booster back to its launch site, but also catching it out of the air with two giant mechanical arms.It occurred during the fifth test flight of the Starship rocket and was a huge step forward for the ambitions of SpaceX and its founder, Elon Musk, which include one day transporting people to Mars.In the more immediate future, NASA is paying SpaceX $4 billion to use Starship to take astronauts to the surface of the moon during two upcoming missions in its Artemis program.Mr. Musk’s company, in addition to having built and flown the world’s largest and most powerful rocket, has also demonstrated a key technology needed to make the vehicle completely reusable and able to fly again and again quickly, more like a jetliner than a rocket.Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator, congratulated SpaceX on Sunday’s flight in a post on the social media platform X.“As we prepare to go back to the Moon under Artemis, continued testing will prepare us for the bold missions that lie ahead — including to the South Pole region of the moon and then on to Mars,” he said.At 8:25 a.m. Eastern time, the rocket, nearly 400 feet tall, lifted off from the SpaceX launch site near Brownsville, Texas. The upper-stage Starship vehicle, stacked on top of the first stage, known as the Super Heavy booster, will be capable of carrying more than 100 metric tons to orbit.ImagePeople watching the launch of the SpaceX Starship, which lifted off from Boca Chica, Texas, on Sunday.Credit...Sergio Flores/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAfter the booster successfully pushed Starship upward through the densest part of the atmosphere, it dropped away as Starship continued to head toward space.The booster then ignited a few of its 33 engines to propel itself back to the launch site. As it fell out of the sky at supersonic speeds, it set off sonic booms that astounded spectators but annoyed some residents.“My house shook on liftoff and re-entry, all the way in Harlingen, 40 miles away,” said Justin LeClaire, a wildlife biologist with the Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries Program, which monitors the SpaceX launches. “It genuinely felt like a minor earthquake, had I not known a rocket was launching.”ImageA Federal Aviation Administration chart comparing a projection of sonic booms from SpaceX launch activities in 2022 with more recent expectations.Credit...Federal Aviation AdministrationClose to the ground, the engines fired again to slow the booster, which looked like a giant falling cigarette with the glow of the engines at the bottom.As the booster descended near the launch tower, it swung back and forth, and flames rose along one side, but that did not seem to knock it off course. It nestled against the arms, which closed gently around the booster, catching it.When the engines switched off, the booster was still hanging in midair.“I don’t know what to say!” Gwynne Shotwell, the chief operating officer of SpaceX, said in a posting on X.A small fire continued to burn at the base of the booster, but the flames soon extinguished.The return of the booster to the launch site was similar to how the first stage of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket re-enters the atmosphere before landing on a floating platform or a landing pad. SpaceX now does that routinely, but the boosters still have to be brought back to the launch site.Mr. Musk envisions that Starships will be able to fly much more often, so SpaceX built a tower with mechanical arms nicknamed chopsticks. SpaceX also plans to use those arms to catch Starships when they return from orbit.While the launch tower caught the booster in Texas, the upper-stage Starship vehicle continued on an arc into space toward the Indian Ocean. For this flight, SpaceX improved the thermal protection on Starship so that it could better withstand the searing heat of re-entry.At least one of the flaps looked like it suffered some damage during re-entry, but Starship survived intact as it performed a soft landing on the water. It then exploded, which was not unexpected. SpaceX was not planning to recover the spacecraft.ImageSpaceX’s Starship during its flight test, in Boca Chica on Sunday.Credit...Kaylee Greenlee Beal/ReutersA camera that SpaceX had set up on a buoy in the ocean captured Starship’s final moments, and the footage suggested that it landed almost exactly where it was aiming for.While SpaceX’s commentators remained focused on the mission Sunday, the test flight occurred as Mr. Musk invested his time and money in supporting the campaign of former President Donald J. Trump. He appeared beside Mr. Trump at a rally this month in Butler, Pa., wearing a shirt that said “Occupy Mars,” and has asserted that Mr. Trump is the only candidate who will get humanity to Mars.To get to Mars — or even land on the moon — SpaceX has more technical challenges to master. They include speeding up the pace of launches and demonstrating the ability to refill Starship’s propellant tanks while in orbit.Mr. Musk is promising that the first Starships to Mars will depart in late 2026, the next time that Earth and Mars line up, and that if those initial landings go well, crewed flights will follow.The sonic booms, which the Federal Aviation Administration had predicted when granting SpaceX permission to launch, could add another issue of contention among the agency, SpaceX and environmentalists who say that not enough is being done to protect people, property and wildlife from the launches.Those complaints could grow as SpaceX is seeking permission to increase the number of Starship launches at its Texas site from five orbital launches a year to 25.But SpaceX says regulators were hindering its progress, with this fifth test flight of Starship delayed for months by bureaucratic sluggishness. The F.A.A. says it is working to protect public safety. At one point, the agency said it wouldn’t approve Sunday’s flight until late November, with a sign-off from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on environmental issues at the Texas launch site a factor in the delay.There has been widespread evidence of environmental consequences to the region, as detailed in a New York Times investigation published in July.After weeks of pressure by Mr. Musk, F.A.A. approval came Saturday for the flight on Sunday. But some environmental caveats were attached.The F.A.A. said SpaceX had agreed to conduct studies of pea-size gravel the rocket sends into the adjacent state park “to determine the distance of the gravel plume and methods for protecting nests during launch events.”SpaceX will also use drones with infrared cameras — which can detect animal nesting sites — during launches, and it will deploy environmental engineers before and after the launches to look for any harm to these birds and their nests.The company may also be asked, if the Fish and Wildlife Service approves, to install temporary shelters to protect the nests during launches.ImageThe sun sets behind SpaceX’s Starship in Boca Chica on Saturday.Credit...Eric Gay/Associated PressIn public filings, the F.A.A. had said that the air pressure, noise and sonic booms all would be more intense during Sunday’s test. During earlier flights, the booster descended over the Gulf of Mexico, much farther from homes.The air pressure, the F.A.A. said in a report made public Saturday, would be nearly strong enough to potentially cause minor damage to older plaster on homes not far from the launch site.Planned post-flight inspections will show if the event caused any damage, and if so, how widespread it was. SpaceX, the F.A.A. said, has insurance to cover the cost of any required structural repairs.Valerie Bates, a manager at the Port Isabel Lighthouse State Historic Site, which is about six miles from the launch site, said the Sunday flight was noticeably stronger, at least to her, than earlier launches once the landing was included.The sound during liftoff is always long and rumbling, she said, but the vibrations were more intense as the booster returned, although there was no apparent damage to the lighthouse. She said some neighbors reported items falling off walls.“This was clearly different,” she said, adding that she was at the lighthouse for the event. “There were two to three really strong booms at the landing that felt more impactful. It was stronger, it was louder.”Not all area residents reported more intense disruptions.Keith Reynolds, who lives four miles from the launch site, said the vibrations and noise were not that different to him than they were during previous launches, and he did not see any damage to his house.“It was an incredible feat,” he said. “I’m ready for the next one and 100 more.”Texas residents around the SpaceX launch site said they felt shaking during Sunday’s flight.ImagePeople watching the launch of the SpaceX Starship, which lifted off from Boca Chica, Texas, on Sunday.Credit...Sergio Flores/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesResidents who live near SpaceX’s launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, and even many miles away reported Sunday that the noise and vibration from the launch and landing of the Super Heavy booster were more intense than during earlier test fights.Their reports on the ground were consistent with warnings from the Federal Aviation Administration, whose regulators had said that would most likely be the case. And the experience of local residents will perhaps intensify questions about SpaceX’s plan to increase activity at the launch site from five orbital launches a year to 25.Valerie Bates, a manager at the Port Isabel Lighthouse State Historic Site, which is about six miles from the launch site, said the Sunday flight was noticeably stronger, at least to her, than earlier launches once the landing was included.The sound during liftoff is always long and rumbling, she said, but the vibrations were more intense as the booster returned.

But it remains in its prototype phase, and it’s not the only big rocket that is flying.NASA has its Space Launch System rocket, which successfully launched in November 2022, sending an uncrewed Orion capsule on a weeklong trip around the moon. The S.L.S. is much more expensive — about $4 billion per launch.The United Launch Alliance this month successfully launched its new Vulcan rocket to orbit for a second time even though it appeared that the nozzle fell off one of the side boosters.Two other heavy-lift rockets are preparing to take flight this month and in November.The first rocket is the Falcon Heavy, another launcher built and operated by SpaceX.The Falcon 9 is SpaceX’s workhorse reusable booster rocket that routinely flies payloads and people to low-Earth orbit. Falcon Heavy is basically three Falcon 9’s strapped together. The Falcon Heavy can generate five million pounds of thrust at liftoff — far below the 16 million pounds that Starship can produce. But it is more powerful than any other vehicle that regularly launches to space these days.Falcon Heavy first took flight in 2018, and has launched 10 times overall.As early as Monday, a Falcon Heavy is scheduled to send Europa Clipper, a large NASA scientific spacecraft, on a trajectory toward Jupiter. When the spacecraft reaches Jupiter, it will begin a series of flybys of Europa, an icy ocean moon that scientists think may be a candidate for habitability.The second heavy-lift vehicle flying soon is New Glenn, an orbital class rocket by Blue Origin. That company was started by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.While Blue Origin was created before SpaceX, the company has yet to send a rocket to orbit. So far, its only flights to space have involved New Shepard, a modest reusable suborbital rocket and capsule that briefly sends tourists and cargo to the edge of space before landing back on Earth.New Glenn, a 320-foot-tall rocket, aims to change that, adding Blue Origin as a player in spaceflight and a serious competitor against SpaceX. Its reusable booster stage’s seven engines will produce 3.85 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, and the company advertises an ability to carry about 100,000 pounds to low-Earth orbit.The rocket has never flown before, although the engine it relies on, the BE-4, has successfully been used in the boosters of the Vulcan rocket.The first flight of New Glenn was to send two small orbiters to Mars on a mission for NASA called ESCAPADE in October. But NASA did not think the rocket would be ready in time. The ESCAPADE mission was postponed until next year. But the first New Glenn rocket will instead launch a different payload, one for Blue Origin itself, in November.It will try to demonstrate partial reuse by landing the New Glenn booster stage on a floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean, essentially the same procedure that SpaceX uses to recover most Falcon 9 boosters.Blue Origin just announced that it is scrubbing this morning’s New Shepard suborbital rocket test flight, so that means SpaceX will be the only company launching anything from Texas today.Trump says SpaceX will reach Mars if he’s elected. Could that really happen?ImageFormer President Donald Trump was joined by Elon Musk during a rally in Butler, Pa.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesFor Starship to land on Mars in any form by Jan. 20, 2029, SpaceX would need to overcome major obstacles.Fomer President Donald J. Trump has touted that if he wins another term as president that the United States will be on the red planet within those four years.“We will lead the world in space and reach Mars before the end of my term,” he said most recently during a rally in Reading, Pa., on Thursday.Mr. Trump has not specified whether he means landing American astronauts, or only spacecraft.But Mr. Musk — who appeared with the former president wearing an “Occupy Mars” T-shirt at a rally in Butler, Pa., earlier this month — has separately promised to send Starships with astronauts to Mars “in 4 years.” He has also warned that humanity will only make it to Mars under a second Trump presidency.“We will never reach Mars if Kamala wins,” he said of Vice President Kamala Harris.Earth and Mars pass relatively close to each other once every 26 months. The next such window to head to Mars will be in late 2026, a time frame during which Mr. Musk said uncrewed Starships would test landing on the red planet.The next launch window after that is December 2028 through January 2029. Mr. Musk says the first astronauts will set off to Mars then.Mr. Musk’s timeline is thus possible, at least in terms of orbital dynamics.But Mr. Musk has a long history of offering unrealistic, overly optimistic schedules for his rocket developments. In 2016, when he first announced his Mars rocket, then called the Interplanetary Transport System, he predicted that the first uncrewed SpaceX missions on Mars would launch in 2022, and that the first astronauts to Mars would be taking off this year.That has not come to pass.So far, there have been four test flights of Starship. None has been fully successful, although SpaceX has made progress with each. Even with the achievements of the fifth launch, huge technological hurdles remain, including quick turnarounds between launches and refueling Starships while in orbit. Each Starship headed to Mars would most likely need at least a dozen or more additional Starship launches to fill up its tanks with methane and liquid oxygen.SpaceX will have to master many of the same technologies in order for Starship to serve as the lunar lander for NASA’s Artemis III mission, which aims to take astronauts to the surface of the moon near the South Pole.The task of sending people to Mars is more plausible if you don’t worry about bringing them back alive.On the International Space Station, toilets still break, but replacements can be sent up within a month or two.Imagine life in space on the way to Mars without a working toilet.The life-support system on the Starship would have to reliably work — scrubbing carbon dioxide from the air, recycling water and performing other tasks to keep it habitable — for more than a year. SpaceX would also need spacesuits usable for walking on Mars, and shelters from the radiation of a solar storm.If the astronauts successfully landed on Mars, the return trip would require more yet-to-be-proven technologies.For one, the Starship would have to be refueled with methane and oxygen. An experiment on NASA’s Perseverance rover on Mars showed that it was indeed possible to extract oxygen from the Martian air. In two years, it generated 4.3 ounces of oxygen. Starship would need several million pounds of oxygen for the return trip and at least a million pounds of methane, too.SpaceX could conceivably send additional Starships with the propellants for the return trip, but that adds complexity.Then there is the question of who would pay for this. These Mars flights would occur at a time when NASA would be busy with its Artemis moon missions. SpaceX already needs two Starship campaigns, an uncrewed test and then the Artemis II mission, to fulfill its contractual obligations to NASA.There is so far no apparent political groundswell for public financing of Mr. Musk’s Mars dreams, and no obvious business case that would attract the investment of venture capitalists.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStarship has set down in the Indian Ocean. And it exploded after it did. The explosion is not unexpected. SpaceX was not planning to recover any of the spacecraft. The landing was recorded by a camera on a buoy, which suggests it landed almost exactly where it was aiming for.Starship is now bellyflopping through at the atmosphere, using the friction of air to slow down. Three of the engines then reignited for the landing burn.ImageCredit...Sergio Flores/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesStarship has slowed below the speed of sound.It looks like some of the flaps are starting to burn up.But the damage is so far not as bad as what occurred during the fourth flight.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe improved thermal protection appears to be holding up. On the last flight, the flaps started burning up around this stage of the journey.A glow of plasma is building up on the belly of Starship as it begins reentering Earth's atmosphere.

With Elon Musk’s space company looking to launch its Falcon 9 and Starship rockets at an ever-quickening pace, the F.A.A. has been hard-pressed to keep up.SpaceX says this fifth test flight of Starship had been delayed for months by unnecessary paperwork and regulatory sluggishness. The F.A.A. says it is working to protect public safety. At one point, the agency said it wouldn’t approve the flight until late November, with a sign-off from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on environmental issues at the launch site in Texas being a factor in the delay.There has been widespread evidence of environmental consequences to the region, as detailed in a New York Times investigation in July.The primary role of the F.A.A. for launches and re-entries is to prevent property damage or injury to a member of the public.After weeks of pressure by Mr. Musk on the agency to speed up its latest review, approval came Saturday for the flight on Sunday. But some environmental caveats were attached.The report in The Times examined, in part, damage that a Starship launch in June caused to the fragile migratory bird habitat surrounding the launch site, including destroying eggs in nearby nests.After the story was published, Mr. Musk made fun of the findings. “To make up for this heinous crime, I will refrain from having omelette for a week,” he wrote in a social media post.In issuing the new launch license, the F.A.A. said SpaceX had agreed to conduct studies, beginning with this launch, of the plume of pea-sized gravel the rocket sends out into the adjacent state park “to determine the distance of the gravel plume and methods for protecting nests during launch events.”SpaceX will also use drones with infrared cameras — which can detect animal nesting sites — during launches, and it will deploy environmental engineers before and after the launches to look for any harm to these birds and their nests.The company may also be asked, if the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approves, to install temporary shelters to protect the nests during the launches, the F.A.A. environmental report released on Saturday said.There have also been other points of conflict between SpaceX and the F.A.A.In September, the F.A.A. proposed $633,000 in fines against SpaceX for violations during launches of the Falcon 9 rockets last year when SpaceX had submitted proposals for changes in its launch procedures without the agency’s approval.“Safety drives everything we do at the F.A.A., including a legal responsibility for the safety oversight of companies with commercial space transportation licenses,” Marc Nichols, the agency’s chief counsel, said in a statement that announced the fines. “Failure of a company to comply with the safety requirements will result in consequences.”Elon Musk called the fines “regulatory overreach.”“The F.A.A. space division is harassing SpaceX about nonsense that doesn’t affect safety while giving a free pass to Boeing even after NASA concluded that their spacecraft was not safe enough to bring back the astronauts,” Mr. Musk wrote on X. “There need to be resignations from the F.A.A. leadership.”In testimony at a congressional hearing, officials from other space companies also said the approval process for launching space missions needs streamlining, but they have not criticized the F.A.A. using language as harsh as Mr. Musk’s.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe X account of Blue Origin, the rocket company started by Jeff Bezos, sent a congratulatory note to SpaceX after the successful rocket catch. Blue Origin’s much smaller New Shepard suborbital rocket is scheduled for an uncrewed test flight from a West Texas launch site in about 45 minutes.Now for about 30 minutes of waiting until Starship re-enters over the Indian Ocean. SpaceX is continuing to beam footage of the vehicle coasting in space with a blue and white Earth below.Meanwhile, the engines on the upper stage Starship vehicle have shut off and it is coasting through space.There is a small fire at the bottom of the booster.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe rocket booster has been caught by the \"chopsticks\" at the launch pad! The upper-stage spacecraft is continuing its upward arc to space. It will not enter orbit but instead is on a trajectory to land in the Indian Ocean.The command has been sent to attempt a booster catch.The rocket's second stage has separated. The booster is descending. We’re waiting to see if SpaceX will attempt the catch of the booster.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTLiftoff Propellant tanks are full with about a minute until liftoff.For Sunday’s flight, SpaceX may try an audacious “chopsticks” landing.ImageStarship is prepared for a test flight from Starbase in June. This test will involve the “chopsticks” catching the returning booster.Credit...Eric Gay/Associated PressThe fifth flight of Starship will proceed like earlier flights in many ways. But there is an important new wrinkle: SpaceX will try to recover the booster stage.The company has been doing something similar with its Falcon 9 rocket for years, landing the first stage on the ground near the launch site or on a barge in the ocean.The Super Heavy booster for Starship, however, is much bigger. It is 232 feet tall and nearly 30 feet wide with 33 Raptor engines. The Falcon 9 booster is about 135 feet tall and 12 feet in diameter with nine of SpaceX’s smaller Merlin engines.And instead of just landing the booster, SpaceX will try to catch it out of the air using what looks like a giant pair of chopsticks that will close around the booster as it arrives at the tower. If that works, the booster will essentially be in position to be refueled for its next launch, saving the time of transporting it back to the launchpad.During the last flight, the booster made a successful simulated landing into the Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX said that if anything was not quite right, the booster would dunk into the Gulf of Mexico again. The catch attempt will require a manual command from the flight director, the company said.The second stage — the Starship spacecraft — will repeat the trajectory of the fourth flight, on a suborbital trajectory that will take it to the Indian Ocean. During the last flight, Starship was able to survive re-entry. But only barely: The steering flaps that guided it through the atmosphere were slowly burning up and disintegrating.SpaceX has added additional thermal protection to Starship to help keep it intact.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFour earlier Starship launches highlighted SpaceX’s “fail fast, learn faster” approach.ImageAn image posted by Elon Musk on the platform X showed a Starship Super Heavy booster fragment being pulled from the ocean last month.Credit...via Elon Musk, XElon Musk made his early fortune with software companies, and he has adopted that industry’s philosophy of not trying to make everything perfect on the first try.For SpaceX, it is OK to blow up a rocket, as long as the failure provides the data to fix the problems on the next try. That approach can often be faster and save the time and effort of coming up with unnecessary solutions to nonexistent problems.Each of Starship’s four flights has achieved steady progress since the first test launch in April 2023, but they have not been without hiccups.Flight 1: April 20, 2023This Starship prototype made it off the launchpad. But, early in the flight, a cascade of engine failures and fires in the booster caused the vehicle to tumble before officials on the ground sent a command to destroy it 24 miles above the Gulf of Mexico.But even that did not go according to plan — 40 seconds passed between the self-destruct command being issued and the rocket finally exploding. The launch also hurled debris across a wide area and generated clouds of dust, which reached a small town miles away from the launchpad at the southern tip of Texas.Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, said in an audio chat on the social media platform X after the flight that it was “Obviously not a complete success, but still nonetheless successful.”Flight 2: Nov. 18, 2023In November, the second Starship launch traveled much farther, with the upper stage traveling for seven minutes and reaching an altitude of about 90 miles and a speed of about 15,000 miles per hour.That was itself an achievement because the company completed a step called hot-staging, during which the upper-stage engines ignite before the stage detaches from the lower Super Heavy booster.According to SpaceX’s “fail fast, learn faster” approach toward rocket design, avoiding a repeat of past failures counts as major progress.Still, both stages of the rocket ended up exploding.Because the upper spacecraft was empty, extra liquid oxygen was loaded to simulate the weight of a future payload it could carry to orbit. But when the extra oxygen was dumped, a fire started, which set off the flight termination system, destroying the spacecraft.Earlier in the flight, after the lower and upper stages separated, several of the 33 engines in the Super Heavy booster shut down and then one blew up, causing the vehicle’s destruction over the Gulf of Mexico.Flight 3: March 4, 2024The third try turned out to be closer to the charm as the Starship upper stage traveled about halfway around the Earth.As it coasted in space, the upper Starship stage tested the spacecraft’s payload door, and the company demonstrated an ability to move propellant between two tanks inside the vehicle.But while coasting at the highest point of its trajectory, Starship began rolling out of control. Cameras on board captured the orange glow of hot plasma beneath the spacecraft. Some 49 minutes after launching, it disintegrated.Earlier in the flight, the Super Heavy booster was to simulate a landing over the Gulf of Mexico. But six of 13 engines used for that maneuver shut down early.Bill Nelson, the administrator of NASA, congratulated SpaceX on what he called a “successful test flight” of the system.Flight 4: June 6, 2024The fourth flight accomplished an ambitious set of goals for SpaceX.After the Super Heavy booster dropped away from the upper stage, the booster was able to gently set down in the Gulf of Mexico. The second-stage spacecraft then traveled halfway around the world, surviving the searing temperatures of re-entering the atmosphere while making a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean.The flight was not flawless, and challenging technical hurdles remain. For instance, heat-resistant tiles were lost from the surface of the spacecraft. And, during atmospheric re-entry of the upper stage, pieces began peeling away from one of the steering flaps near the top of the spacecraft, though the flap continued to function.The successes, surpassing what was accomplished during the previous test flight in March, offered optimism for the vision of a rocket that is the biggest and most powerful to date, yet entirely reusable.Loading of propellants to the rocket's lower and upper stages has started.SpaceX reports that it is “go” for loading the methane and oxygen propellants into Starship and that the weather looks good for liftoff.However, the launch time has been pushed back to 8:25 a.m. Eastern, or just five minutes before the end of the 30-minute launch window.ImageCredit...Sergio Flores/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhat Is SpaceX’s Starship? It’s really a Mars ship.ImageA Starship test flight in March.Credit...Chandan Khanna/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe main reason that SpaceX is building Starship is that Elon Musk really wants to send people to Mars. Otherwise, there is not a strong business case for a rocket that big and that powerful even as SpaceX plans to use it to launch its next generation of Starlink satellites and to carry NASA astronauts to the surface of the moon.With the Starship spacecraft on top of the Super Heavy booster, it is the tallest rocket ever built — 397 feet tall, or about 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty including the pedestal.It has the most engines ever in a rocket booster: The Super Heavy has 33 of SpaceX’s powerful Raptor engines sticking out of its bottom. As those engines lift Starship off the launchpad in South Texas, they will generate 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle.An even more transformative feature of Starship is that it is designed to be entirely reusable. The Super Heavy booster is to land much like those for SpaceX’s smaller Falcon 9 rockets, and Starship will be able to return from space belly-flopping through the atmosphere like a sky diver before pivoting to a vertical position for landing.If SpaceX has regularly pull that off, that means the really expensive pieces — like the 33 Raptor engines in the Super Heavy booster and six additional Raptors in Starship itself — will be used over and over instead of thrown away into the ocean after one flight.That has the potential to cut the cost of sending payloads into orbit — to less than $10 million to take 100 tons to space, Mr. Musk has predicted.Starship and Super Heavy are shiny because SpaceX made them out of stainless steel, which is cheaper than other materials like carbon composites. But one side of Starship is coated in black tiles to protect the spacecraft from the extreme heat that it will encounter if it gets far enough in its flight to re-enter the atmosphere.SpaceX was set to have a split-screen experience this morning as the four astronauts of Crew-8 undocked from the International Space Station in the company’s Crew Dragon vehicle to head home to Earth. But SpaceX announced about four hours ago that it was postponing that operation because of poor weather conditions off the Florida coast where the astronauts would have splashed down.Here’s what to know about the fifth Starship test flight.How hard is it to catch a rocket? SpaceX will try on Sunday during its fifth test flight of Starship, the giant next-generation rocket that is the most powerful ever built.NASA is counting on Starship to take astronauts to the moon, and Elon Musk, the company’s founder, sees it as a vehicle for his ambitions of humanity’s colonization of Mars. The massive, stainless steel vehicle is taller than the Statue of Liberty and its pedestal and is capable of carrying about 550,000 pounds to orbit. It is divided into two sections, the lower booster stage known as the Super Heavy that has 33 engines, and the upper Starship stage that is to travel to and from orbit with cargo or astronauts aboard.Before SpaceX started routinely landing and reflying the booster stages of its workhorse Falcon 9 rockets, most rockets used in spaceflight were discarded after a single use. The company is taking the next step with the much-larger Starship.The flight on Sunday will try to bring the rocket’s booster back to the launchpad, which would be a major step toward the company’s goal of a quick turnaround between launches. It is also a prerequisite in its goal of flying NASA astronauts to the moon, and eventually people to Mars.Here’s what to know about Sunday’s test launch:The rocket lifted off at 8:25 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, 25 minutes into a 30-minute launch window. SpaceX is streaming live video coverage of the flight, which you can watch in the video player embedded above.The rocket lifted off from SpaceX’s launchpad in southern Texas, just outside Brownsville. The Federal Aviation Administration granted regulatory approval for the flight on Saturday after earlier suggesting it would not do so until November.The main new wrinkle for this flight is that SpaceX will try to recover the booster stage, the Super Heavy, which has either splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico or exploded after earlier flights. Instead of just setting the booster down on a landing pad or a ship, the standard practice for the Falcon 9 booster, SpaceX will try to catch the Super Heavy booster out of the air using a pair of arms that look like a giant pair of chopsticks that are attached to the vehicle’s launch tower.The second stage — the Starship spacecraft — will repeat the trajectory of the fourth flight, on a suborbital trajectory that will take it to the Indian Ocean.The flight on Sunday takes place as Mr. Musk invests his time and money in supporting the presidential campaign of former President Donald J. Trump. He appeared beside Mr. Trump at a rally this month in Butler, Pa., wearing a shirt that said “Occupy Mars,” and has asserted that Mr. Trump is the only candidate who will get humanity to Mars.",

None has been fully successful, although SpaceX has made progress with each. Even with the achievements of the fifth launch, huge technological hurdles remain, including quick turnarounds between launches and refueling Starships while in orbit. Each Starship headed to Mars would most likely need at least a dozen or more additional Starship launches to fill up its tanks with methane and liquid oxygen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpaceX will have to master many of the same technologies in order for Starship to serve as the lunar lander for NASA’s Artemis III mission, which aims to take astronauts to the surface of the moon near the South Pole.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe task of sending people to Mars is more plausible if you don’t worry about bringing them back alive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the International Space Station, toilets still break, but replacements can be sent up within a month or two.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImagine life in space on the way to Mars without a working toilet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe life-support system on the Starship would have to reliably work — scrubbing carbon dioxide from the air, recycling water and performing other tasks to keep it habitable — for more than a year. SpaceX would also need spacesuits usable for walking on Mars, and shelters from the radiation of a solar storm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf the astronauts successfully landed on Mars, the return trip would require more yet-to-be-proven technologies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor one, the Starship would have to be refueled with methane and oxygen. An experiment on NASA’s Perseverance rover on Mars showed that it was indeed possible to extract oxygen from the Martian air. In two years, it generated 4.3 ounces of oxygen. Starship would need several million pounds of oxygen for the return trip and at least a million pounds of methane, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpaceX could conceivably send additional Starships with the propellants for the return trip, but that adds complexity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there is the question of who would pay for this. These Mars flights would occur at a time when NASA would be busy with its Artemis moon missions. SpaceX already needs two Starship campaigns, an uncrewed test and then the Artemis II mission, to fulfill its contractual obligations to NASA.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is so far no apparent political groundswell for public financing of Mr. Musk’s Mars dreams, and no obvious business case that would attract the investment of venture capitalists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"FeedItem\" id=\"ad-1\" role=\"article\" aria-posinset=\"31\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" aria-live=\"off\" aria-labelledby=\"post-title-ad1\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdvertisement\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"#after-dfp-ad-mid2\"\u003eSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv role=\"article\" aria-posinset=\"30\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" aria-live=\"off\" aria-labelledby=\"post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNmVkYmU2OWItOTIyYy01M2Y2LWEwOWItZjFkNGFkYzc0Y2Nm\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"6edbe69b-922c-53f6-a09b-f1d4adc74ccf\" data-testid=\"reporter-update\" data-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/13/science/spacex-starship-launch#6edbe69b-922c-53f6-a09b-f1d4adc74ccf\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"live-blog-byline\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Kenneth Chang\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-kenneth-chang/author-kenneth-chang-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-kenneth-chang/author-kenneth-chang-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-kenneth-chang/author-kenneth-chang-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp 150w\" sizes=\"40px\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eStarship has set down in the Indian Ocean.

But there is an important new wrinkle: SpaceX will try to recover the booster stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe company has been doing something similar with its Falcon 9 rocket for years, landing the first stage on the ground near the launch site or on a barge in the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Super Heavy booster for Starship, however, is much bigger. It is 232 feet tall and nearly 30 feet wide with 33 Raptor engines. The Falcon 9 booster is about 135 feet tall and 12 feet in diameter with nine of SpaceX’s smaller Merlin engines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd instead of just landing the booster, SpaceX will try to catch it out of the air using what looks like a giant pair of chopsticks that will close around the booster as it arrives at the tower. If that works, the booster will essentially be in position to be refueled for its next launch, saving the time of transporting it back to the launchpad.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the last flight, the booster made a successful simulated landing into the Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX said that if anything was not quite right, the booster would dunk into the Gulf of Mexico again.

Otherwise, there is not a strong business case for a rocket that big and that powerful even as SpaceX plans to use it to launch its next generation of Starlink satellites and to carry NASA astronauts to the surface of the moon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the Starship spacecraft on top of the Super Heavy booster, it is the tallest rocket ever built — 397 feet tall, or about 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty including the pedestal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt has the most engines ever in a rocket booster: The Super Heavy has 33 of SpaceX’s powerful Raptor engines sticking out of its bottom. As those engines lift Starship off the launchpad in South Texas, they will generate 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn even more transformative feature of Starship is that it is designed to be entirely reusable. The Super Heavy booster is to land much like those for SpaceX’s smaller Falcon 9 rockets, and Starship will be able to return from space belly-flopping through the atmosphere like a sky diver before pivoting to a vertical position for landing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf SpaceX has regularly pull that off, that means the really expensive pieces — like the 33 Raptor engines in the Super Heavy booster and six additional Raptors in Starship itself — will be used over and over instead of thrown away into the ocean after one flight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat has the potential to cut the cost of sending payloads into orbit — to less than $10 million to take 100 tons to space, Mr. Musk has predicted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStarship and Super Heavy are shiny because SpaceX made them out of stainless steel, which is cheaper than other materials like carbon composites. But one side of Starship is coated in black tiles to protect the spacecraft from the extreme heat that it will encounter if it gets far enough in its flight to re-enter the atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"24d57a94-782c-501c-b183-8f468bde9d9e\" data-testid=\"reporter-update\" data-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/13/science/spacex-starship-launch#24d57a94-782c-501c-b183-8f468bde9d9e\" role=\"article\" aria-posinset=\"2\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" aria-live=\"off\" aria-labelledby=\"post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMjRkNTdhOTQtNzgyYy01MDFjLWIxODMtOGY0NjhiZGU5ZDll\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"live-blog-byline\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-roston\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Michael Roston\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/25/multimedia/author-michael-roston/author-michael-roston-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/25/multimedia/author-michael-roston/author-michael-roston-thumbStandard-v5.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/25/multimedia/author-michael-roston/author-michael-roston-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp 150w\" sizes=\"40px\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpaceX was set to have a split-screen experience this morning as the four astronauts of Crew-8 undocked from the International Space Station in the company’s Crew Dragon vehicle to head home to Earth.

SpaceX will try on Sunday during its fifth test flight of Starship, the giant next-generation rocket that is the most powerful ever built.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNASA is counting on Starship to take astronauts to the moon, and Elon Musk, the company’s founder, sees it as a vehicle for his ambitions of humanity’s colonization of Mars. The massive, stainless steel vehicle is taller than the Statue of Liberty and its pedestal and is capable of carrying about 550,000 pounds to orbit. It is divided into two sections, the lower booster stage known as the Super Heavy that has 33 engines, and the upper Starship stage that is to travel to and from orbit with cargo or astronauts aboard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore SpaceX started routinely landing and reflying the booster stages of its workhorse Falcon 9 rockets, most rockets used in spaceflight were discarded after a single use. The company is taking the next step with the much-larger Starship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe flight on Sunday will try to bring the rocket’s booster back to the launchpad, which would be a major step toward the company’s goal of a quick turnaround between launches. It is also a prerequisite in its goal of flying NASA astronauts to the moon, and eventually people to Mars.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s what to know about Sunday’s test launch:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe rocket lifted off at 8:25 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, 25 minutes into a 30-minute launch window. SpaceX is \u003ca href=\"https://www.spacex.com/launches/mission/?missionId=starship-flight-5\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estreaming live video coverage\u003c/a\u003e of the flight, which you can watch in the video player embedded above.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe rocket lifted off from SpaceX’s launchpad in southern Texas, just outside Brownsville. The Federal Aviation Administration granted regulatory approval for the flight on Saturday after earlier suggesting it would not do so until November.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe main new wrinkle for this flight is that SpaceX will try to recover the booster stage, the Super Heavy, which has either splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico or exploded after earlier flights. Instead of just setting the booster down on a landing pad or a ship, the standard practice for the Falcon 9 booster, SpaceX will try to catch the Super Heavy booster out of the air using a pair of arms that look like a giant pair of chopsticks that are attached to the vehicle’s launch tower.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second stage — the Starship spacecraft — will repeat the trajectory of the fourth flight, on a suborbital trajectory that will take it to the Indian Ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe flight on Sunday takes place as Mr. Musk invests his time and money in supporting the presidential campaign of former President Donald J. Trump. He appeared beside Mr. Trump at a rally this month in Butler, Pa., wearing a shirt that said “Occupy Mars,” and has asserted that Mr. Trump is the only candidate who will get humanity to Mars.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
