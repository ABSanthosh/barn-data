  "text": "Understanding how the universe transitioned from darkness to light with the formation of the first stars and galaxies is a key turning point in the universe's development, known as the Cosmic Dawn. However, even with the most powerful telescopes, we can't directly observe these earliest stars, so determining their properties is one of the biggest challenges in astronomy. Now, an international group of astronomers led by the University of Cambridge have shown that we will be able to learn about the masses of the earliest stars by studying a specific radio signal - created by hydrogen atoms filling the gaps between star-forming regions - originating just a hundred million years after the Big Bang. By studying how the first stars and their remnants affected this signal, called the 21-centimeter signal, the researchers have shown that future radio telescopes will help us understand the very early universe, and how it transformed from a nearly homogeneous mass of mostly hydrogen to the incredible complexity we see today. Their results are reported in the journal Nature Astronomy. \"This is a unique opportunity to learn how the universe's first light emerged from the darkness,\" said co-author Professor Anastasia Fialkov from Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy. \"The transition from a cold, dark universe to one filled with stars is a story we're only beginning to understand.\" The study of the universe's most ancient stars hinges on the faint glow of the 21-centimetre signal, a subtle energy signal from over 13 billion years ago. This signal, influenced by the radiation from early stars and black holes, provides a rare window into the universe's infancy. Fialkov leads the theory group of REACH (the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen). REACH is a radio antenna and is one of two major projects that could help us learn about the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionisation, when the first stars reionised neutral hydrogen atoms in the universe. Although REACH, which captures radio signals, is still in its calibration stage, it promises to reveal data about the early universe. Meanwhile, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) -- a massive array of antennas under construction -- will map fluctuations in cosmic signals across vast regions of the sky. Both projects are vital in probing the masses, luminosities, and distribution of the universe's earliest stars. In the current study, Fialkov - who is also a member of the SKA - and her collaborators developed a model that makes predictions for the 21-centimeter signal for both REACH and SKA, and found that the signal is sensitive to the masses of first stars. \"We are the first group to consistently model the dependence of the 21-centimeter signal of the masses of the first stars, including the impact of ultraviolet starlight and X-ray emissions from X-ray binaries produced when the first stars die,\" said Fialkov, who is also a member of Cambridge's Kavli Institute for Cosmology. \"These insights are derived from simulations that integrate the primordial conditions of the universe, such as the hydrogen-helium composition produced by the Big Bang.\" In developing their theoretical model, the researchers studied how the 21-centimeter signal reacts to the mass distribution of the first stars, known as Population III stars. They found that previous studies have underestimated this connection as they did not account for the number and brightness of X-ray binaries - binary systems made of a normal star and a collapsed star - among Population III stars, and how they affect the 21-centimeter signal. Unlike optical telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope, which capture vivid images, radio astronomy relies on statistical analysis of faint signals. REACH and SKA will not be able to image individual stars, but will instead provide information about entire populations of stars, X-ray binary systems and galaxies. \"It takes a bit of imagination to connect radio data to the story of the first stars, but the implications are profound,\" said Fialkov. \"The predictions we are reporting have huge implications for our understanding of the nature of the very first stars in the Universe,\" said co-author Dr Eloy de Lera Acedo, Principal Investigator of the REACH telescope and PI at Cambridge of the SKA development activities. \"We show evidence that our radio telescopes can tell us details about the mass of those first stars and how these early lights may have been very different from today's stars. \"Radio telescopes like REACH are promising to unlock the mysteries of the infant Universe, and these predictions are essential to guide the radio observations we are doing from the Karoo, in South Africa.\" The research was supported in part by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Anastasia Fialkov is a Fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge. Eloy de Lera Acedo is an STFC Ernest Rutherford Fellow and a Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge.",
