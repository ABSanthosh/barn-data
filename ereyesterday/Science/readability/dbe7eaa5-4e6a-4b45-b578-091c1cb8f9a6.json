She sees herself as a part of the forest and fights to protect it.\"The film delves into the complex relationship between humans and nature, promoting a message of harmonious coexistence between the two: something we hope to echo through this naming.\"Deepwater tilefish are commonly found in seafood markets across east and southeast Asia.However their diversity remains relatively low, with only 31 described species in the Branchiostegidae family and 19 in the Branchiostegus genus.\"Finding a new species in this group is a rare and fortunate event, especially one as distinctive as Branchiostegus sanae,\" said Haochen Huang.Only three new species in the genus Branchiostegus have been identified in the last 34 years.Specimens have been preserved in marine biological collections to help scientists learn more about them.",
