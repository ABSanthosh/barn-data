  "text": "Ridgeline charts are nice to look at, and that is enough reason to make them. Use a gradient fill for extra sauce. Ridgeline charts, sometimes but less often called frequency trails, show time series data with overlapping line or area charts. Because of the overlapping, you can see more vertically in less space than if you were to squish each category to a single band. To access this full tutorial, you must be a member.
