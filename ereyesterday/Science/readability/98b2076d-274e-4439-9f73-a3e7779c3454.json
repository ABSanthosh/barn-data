Tariffs aren’t typical science fair but in the general interest of factsplaining… Let’s explain what they are. A tax. Essentially a sales tax, but they work slightly differently. A sales tax is applied to consumer goods when you buy a product. A tariff is a tax on imported goods. Typically applied to select goods in an effort to protect native manufacturing. A blanket tariff is then essentially a sale tax on all imported consumer goods. Blanket tariffs and sales taxes are specifically consumer burdens. And nobody has ever suggested adding tariffs as a way to combat inflation Blanket tariffs = more expensive goods = which is the definition of higher inflation. They also tend to affect financially disadvantaged people more than wealthy ones… As the wealthy tend to spend a much smaller percentage of their income on consumer goods, And therefore contribute a smaller portion of their income to sales tax or tariff increases. Tariffs are not necessarily a bad thing, they can make domestic products more competitive, protecting worker wages and industries… a common tactic of social democracies They could be used to support social services, universal healthcare, education and scientific research… like in a social democracy But to apply them after 40 years of outsourcing… in a post-manufacturing economy. While dismantling government services, education, and investment in science… The things those taxes could have contributed to? And following that up with tax cuts for the wealthy who are, again, not personally affected by the sales tax increase… as it represents a small change to the margin of the margins to them. Raising taxes on consumers while cutting spending on consumers, in order to cut taxes for the already wealthy… Is wealth redistribution from the poor, from the working class, from the middle class… to the wealthiest investor class… exacerbating wealth inequality But hey, maybe that’s the plan?
