Karolis Kavolelis/Alamy Stock PhotoCLIMATEWIRE | The Trump administration proposed eliminating a program that helps low-income families heat and cool their homes, saying “energy dominance” policies make subsidizing electricity costs unnecessary.The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program provides support to some 6 million Americans and has bipartisan support in Congress, particularly among Republicans such as Maine Sen. Susan Collins, whose constituents depend on the funds to heat their homes in the winter.As climate change has turbocharged heat waves across the country, LIHEAP has been increasingly relied on to fund air conditioning costs. Lawmakers from hotter states have pushed for increased funding to help low-income Americans remain safe in the summer.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

The program’s staff is set to be fired on June 2.Trump’s proposal to eliminate funding would start to hit families this fall — if Congress agrees. Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, has been a staunch supporter of LIHEAP for years.She and others on the committee sent a letter in early April to HHS urging the administration to \"reverse course on any staffing or funding cuts,” which it said “threaten to devastate a critical program dedicated to helping Americans afford their home energy bills.”“Access to affordable home energy is a matter of health and safety for many low-income households, children and seniors,” the letter said.Reprinted from E\u0026E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC.
