  "text": "Credit: CC0 Public Domain The race to build the first useful quantum computer is on and may revolutionize the world with brand new capabilities, from medicine to freight logistics. Tech companies all want to take the crown, with Microsoft announcing the first of its kind quantum chip in February, only days before Google's breakthrough on quantum error correction. As the race heats up, companies are turning to a new ultracold solution—neutral atoms—which Swinburne University of Technology has been exploring and making discoveries in for two decades. Swinburne quantum expert Associate Professor Tapio Simula explains what neutral atoms are and what makes them a key player in our quantum future. What are neutral atoms? Atoms underpin all of chemistry, as they form the basis of elements and their interactions. A neutral atom is an atom where the number of protons (positively charged particles) equals the number of electrons (negatively charged particles). This balance results in no overall electrical charge, making the atom electrically neutral. For our quantum future, neutral atoms hold great opportunities and are the most useful when cooled down to ultralow temperatures. \"A typical cold atom experiment takes a small cloud of neutral atoms—millions of times thinner than air—and levitates it inside a vacuum chamber using optics and magnetic fields,\" explains Associate Professor Simula. \"Then laser beams are fired at the atoms to, counterintuitively, cool the atoms incredibly close to absolute zero. At this point, they can no longer be described using classical Newtonian physics. \"From here, the laws of quantum mechanics open a world of new opportunities, with experimentalists using these ultracold neutral atom platforms to study the fundamental laws of physics.\" What can cold neutral atoms do? Ultracold neutral atoms are used for building game-changing technologies, including the world's most accurate atomic clocks, ultra-sensitive quantum sensors, and state-of-the-art quantum computers. Within the Optical Sciences Center at Swinburne University of Technology, there are three cold atoms research laboratories dedicated to experimental studies. There, Associate Professor Simula's research has shown promise in the physics of quantum vortices in superfluids—fluids that may realize lossless transport of energy. \"These tiny quantum cyclones have deep connections to a diversity of phenomena ranging from high-temperature superconductivity to the physics of rotating neutron stars. \"Some of them could even be used as quantum bits of information in a quantum computer, like the one Microsoft is working on.\" Why are neutral atoms important? Neutral atoms are the new player in town that could be the key to our quantum computing dreams, with big tech companies including Google, IBM and Microsoft now partnering with neutral atom quantum computer developers. The world's quantum future will be unlocked with a combination of quantum computing, sensing and communication, says Associate Professor Simula. \"All of these developers are spin-off companies spawning out of cold atoms research laboratories similar to those housed at Swinburne where groundbreaking ultracold atoms research has been conducted already for two decades.\" \"While quantum computers do exist, they're still in their infancy. But they promise huge potential to transform logistics, medtech and more.\" Citation: Q\u0026A: Companies are racing to develop the first useful quantum computer—ultracold neutral atoms could be the key (2025, June 30) retrieved 30 June 2025 from https://phys.org/news/2025-06-qa-companies-quantum-ultracold-neutral.html This document is subject to copyright.
