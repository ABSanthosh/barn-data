Etienne Laurent/AFP via Getty ImagesCLIMATEWIRE | The return of former President Donald Trump to the White House puts at risk new heat protections for workers that were proposed over the summer by the Biden administration, say workplace advocates.Trump on the campaign trail never directly addressed the proposal from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which would force employers to provide their workers with water and cool places to rest when temperatures are high.But many of Trump’s Republican allies in Congress panned the idea when it was announced, including House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.). Westerman called it “one of the most idiotic things they’ve ever done” and said the heat protection rules ignored the realities of outdoor work.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

And health advocates say the toll is likely to increase as temperatures rise with global warming.OSHA has been under pressure to protect workers from heat for decades, starting with a 1986 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommending heat standards.More recently, congressional Democrats put pressure on the agency at the end of the Trump administration with a bill — co-sponsored by now-Vice President Kamala Harris — that would have required the agency to issue a rule.But it was only this past summer that OSHA finally proposed the regulation which, if finalized, could protect some 35 million workers from extreme heat.Groups representing some of those workers now fear it won’t be enacted.“President Trump would have to actively work to undo that progress intentionally putting workers — including many who no doubt voted for him — in harm’s way,” said Antonio De Loera-Brust, a spokesperson for the United Farm Workers. “Whether these workers are killed by extreme heat on the job should not be a partisan issue.”In the absence of federal action, workers and their advocates would have to lobby the 29 states that enforce worker safety rules to enact their own heat protections, Barab said.He added that state action could create a situation similar to the history of the “right to know” rule, which requires employers to inform workers about the hazardous properties of the chemicals they work with. In 1981, the Reagan administration froze work on such regulations that began under President Jimmy Carter.After labor advocates successfully convinced some 15 states to adopt their own rules over two years, OSHA was forced to publish its own right to know rule to standardize requirements across jurisdictions in 1983.Six states currently have heat protections for workers, but others are resistant to the idea. Texas and Florida recently passed laws blocking municipalities from requiring water and rest breaks for workers.One state that has moved forward with greater protections is Maryland, which enacted its heat standards in September — spurred in part by the heat stroke death of a Baltimore sanitation worker.“If there’s any silver lining, it’s that there is no doubt that climate change is a problem, and that it is likely to be a record hot spring and summer again. These rising temperatures are not easy to hide, nor are the inevitable workplace deaths,” Barab said. “So it’s possible there will be some pressure to do something at the state and federal level.”Reprinted from E\u0026E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC.
