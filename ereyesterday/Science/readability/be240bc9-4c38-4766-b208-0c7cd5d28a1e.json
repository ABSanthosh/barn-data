  "description": "AI in warfare is no longer hypothetical; it's inevitable, says Palmer Luckey, an inventor and founder of the defense technology company Anduril Industries. He takes us inside the high-tech arms race to build AI-powered weapons, \"killer robots\" and autonomous fighter jets at scale â€” and makes the counterintuitive case for why this may be the surest path to deterrence and lasting peace. (Followed by Q\u0026A with technologist Bilawal Sidhu)",
