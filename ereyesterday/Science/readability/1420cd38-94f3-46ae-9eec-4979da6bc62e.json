  "text": "January 29, 20254 min readTrump seems intent on freezing out professional scientists, especially those with strong academic research backgrounds. Instead, he is stocking the leadership of federal agencies with technologists and loyalistsUS President Donald Trump holds an executive order announcing the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, he just signed during the inaugural parade inside Capital One Arena, in Washington, DC, on January 20, 2025. Jim Watson/AFP via Getty ImagesAlmost lost in the recent maelstrom of President Donald Trump’s frenetic norm-breaking conduct is an ominous forecast for science. Just days have passed since Trump returned to the Oval Office, but his executive orders and nominations provide early clues about how the second Trump administration could shatter the remarkable science and technology engine that has driven the American economy for more than three quarters of a century.On the campaign trail, Trump promised to slash federal spending, fire agency experts he deemed “rogue” and take a sledgehammer to fact-based policies that didn’t suit his whims. With the assistance of his Capitol Hill allies, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, and his mega financial campaign backer Elon Musk, head of the newly created advisory group known as DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency), he is beginning to deliver on his pledges.Trump’s nominees for many high-level administrative posts bear ample testimony to his disdain for science. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., whom he has tapped to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, is perhaps the most obvious case. A lawyer by training and an antivaccine peddler and conspiracy theorist by reputation, he would have authority over the direction of the National Institutes of Health, the nation’s biomedical research gem with a budget of almost $50 billion a year.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.But he’s not the only one. Chris Wright, a fracking executive and Trump’s choice for energy secretary, is not an outright climate change denier, but he’s skeptical of the scientific consensus that a hotter planet is causing more frequent extreme weather events. While he acknowledges the impact of carbon emissions on global warming, he continues to promote increased production and use of fossil fuels. You’d have to twist yourself into a pretzel to reconcile those two viewpoints scientifically. Of course, he’s echoing the centerpiece of Trump’s energy policy: “Drill, baby, drill.”These two appointments only serve to reinforce Trump’s own rejection of science. He’s falsely claimed that climate change is a hoax; he’s railed against windmills, calling them, without scientific evidence, whale killers; he’s blamed the recent Los Angeles wildfires on the closure of a valve on a water pipeline that doesn’t exist; and, in his first term, he promoted dangerous quack medicines to combat COVID. He’s said he wants clean air and clean water, but contrary to good science, he’s promoting a return to coal for producing electricity and is in the midst of hijacking California’s water management practices that carefully control salinity in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta.You need only look at two executive actions with international ramifications to begin to grasp the scope of Trump’s war on science. On day one of his new administration, he announced America’s exit from both the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization. Science, which is international in character, simply doesn’t have a seat at Trump’s “America First” table.These aren’t the only indicators of where science is likely to be heading in the next few years under Trump. Whereas presidents in the post–World War II era generally put a high value on scientific expertise, Trump seems intent on freezing out professional scientists, especially those with strong academic research backgrounds. Instead he is stocking the leadership of federal agencies with technologists. Admittedly some have an admiration and strong appreciation for science. For the most part, however, their credentials speak of transactional policymaking and a buy-in to the Silicon Valley culture of breaking things before fixing them.That tech bro culture, which has captured Trump’s imagination, has little appetite for patience—an essential and necessary facet of the kind of fundamental research that ultimately fuels America’s science and technology engine. Musk and other members of the “PayPal Mafia” who are advising Trump, might deliver impressive economic returns in the here and now, but such benefits would almost certainly come at the expense of a sputtering science and technology engine in the future.A few of Trump’s prospective appointments and their credentials illustrate where he places an emphasis.David Sacks who would lead the President’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, better known by its acronym PCAST, is a lawyer and venture capitalist, known for his involvement with AI and cryptocurrency, which he would oversee as the administration’s “czar.”Michael Kratsios, who would direct the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and serve as the president’s science adviser, received favorable reviews from the science community when he served as OSTP’s chief technology officer and interim director in Trump’s first term. But his educational background in politics and Hellenic studies is certainly out of the ordinary. He has been managing director at an AI company for the last three years, putting him in the technologists’ camp.Emil Michael, who would serve as undersecretary of defense for research and engineering is a former Uber executive. He is a businessman with a legal education, not the accomplished engineering one typically found in a technical Pentagon role.Dario Gil, whom Trump has tapped to be undersecretary of energy for science and innovation, is perhaps an exception, having served as chairman of the National Science Board and as IBM’s director of research. His professional profile speaks to his capabilities, but by training and experience he is more of a technologist than a scientist.Leadership and policies matter, but the quality of the federal science workforce and federal science budgets are just as important. During his first week in office, Trump established a government-wide hiring freeze and took steps that would allow him to replace a class of federal workers with Trump loyalists, both threatening the continuity and freedom from overt political interference that science requires. On the funding side, science support is caught in a vise between Republican plans to reduce taxes and increase defense spending, while constraining the size of the federal debt. That’s the future. The present? All federal grants have just been suspended until grantees show that they don’t run afoul of Trump’s unilateral executive orders. (The grant suspension was then temporarily paused by a federal judge.)Absent greater public awareness the ominous forecast will turn into inevitability.This is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.",
