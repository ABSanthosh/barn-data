It was like a surgical instrument or the bow of a violin.”In research published last month in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science, Dr. O’Corry-Crowe and colleagues make the case that narwhals aren’t only showing off with their tusks — the appendages have a variety of demonstrated uses that help the animals survive in the ocean.The narwhal’s tusk was an inspiration for unicorn myths. It’s known that only males have them, with rare exception, and that a big tusk is something female narwhals look for in a mate. But the animals have been difficult to study.“They’re extremely shy and elusive whales,” said Kristin Laidre, an applied animal ecology professor at the University of Washington who was not involved in the study. “They’re really hard to approach. They’re really skittish.” She added that narwhals tended to spend their time far from shore and diving deep into the water, and that doing research in the Arctic was logistically complex, making them a challenging species to observe in the wild.With the help of local Inuit communities, the team of researchers identified a spot in the Canadian High Arctic to set up camp and fly drones. The calm waters of Creswell Bay in Nunavut, where narwhals had previously been observed spending their summers, were shallow and clear and — combined with the 24-hour daylight in August — allowed the researchers to film some of the best footage of narwhals ever captured.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
