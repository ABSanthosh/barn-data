Lee shares the inspiring story behind her journey to starting a green roof company in Arkansas, rooted in her passion for landscape architecture and sustainability that began in college. After realizing there were no green roof companies in the area, Lee pivoted from her original career plans and took the entrepreneurial leap, launching Ozark Green Roofs in 2018 with support from Startup Junkie and her network.The conversation explores the challenges and milestones of building a unique niche business, from early residential projects to high-profile commercial jobs such as the Fayetteville Public Library, First National Bank, Uptown Apartments, and most notably, the ambitious green roof for the Alice L. Walton School of Medicine. Lee details the technical and environmental benefits of green roofs, sharing how these projects contribute to sustainability, stormwater management, and improving urban environments.Additionally, Lee discusses the importance of teamwork, mentorship, and her advisory board in growing the company. She highlights her recent steps into hiring and expanding her team, her commitment to offering employee benefits, and her ambitions to become the leading regional green roof provider.
