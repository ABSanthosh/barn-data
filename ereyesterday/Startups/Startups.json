Susan shares her remarkable journey—how a life-changing car accident led her from being a business owner to becoming a professional artist, teacher, and inventor, all centered around her love for creative expression. She emphasizes the importance of following your passions, seizing unexpected opportunities, and embracing the philosophy of “finding a need and filling it,” which shaped both her artistic and entrepreneurial endeavors.Additionally, Allen recounts his transition from a career in engineering to curating art exhibitions, inspired in part by his father’s experience as an under-recognized artist. His work bridges artists with the community and market, using innovative, community-focused approaches—including events, collaborations, and themed exhibitions—to promote inclusivity and connection. He and Susan discuss the challenges and rewards of creative entrepreneurship, underscoring the importance of experimentation, mentorship, and supporting one another.Both guests reflect on the power of community, the need to stay open to life’s twists, and the significance of giving back. Their advice for aspiring creative entrepreneurs: keep learning, be kind to yourself through setbacks, and pursue what you love!Show Notes(00:00) Introduction(04:24) Rediscovering Purpose Through Art Classes(08:46) Embarking on a Painting Journey(11:39) Unexpected Opportunities in Art Career(15:34) Finding Purpose Through Failure(22:10) Curating Underrecognized Artists' Stories(25:16) Turning Art into Business(31:01) Creative Entrepreneurship: Filling Market Gaps(33:55) Art for All: Inclusive Engagement(40:07) Closing ThoughtsLinksDaniel KoonceStartup JunkieStartup Junkie YouTubeAllen PauloseSusan EdgmonARt deCentrale",

The episode opens with Daniel’s refreshingly candid take on entering the startup and medtech world with little prior experience, powered mostly by curiosity and grit. Raised in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and later moving to Tulsa, Oklahoma, Daniel built bridges between both cultures and leveraged local gaps in care to inspire his entrepreneurial mission.Skin Check stands at the cutting edge of healthtech, offering an end-to-end digital dermatology platform that expedites access to expert skin care and enables early detection of skin cancer—a disease for which early diagnosis is life-saving. With an app already boasting over one hundred and sixty-five users, Skin Check harnesses AI and computer vision for accurate screenings across all skin tones, making equity a priority both in design and delivery.Daniel shares stories from his early ventures—including building vital medical devices during the COVID-19 ventilator shortage and founding university-based incubators—highlighting his passion for empowering underrepresented innovators. Throughout the episode, what stands out is Daniel’s commitment to democratizing healthcare access, particularly for rural and underserved communities. The discussion also covers the challenges of building a tech startup outside the typical Silicon Valley hubs and the power of community and perseverance.
