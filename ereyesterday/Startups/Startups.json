    "link": "https://github.com/nafey/minimalytics",
    "description": "Hi everyone! I wanted to share my analytics app with you.This project came from requirements to track certain very frequent events. I found that the cost to do it on a regular analytics product was much more than i was willing to pay. Secondly, I also wanted to use as few resources as possible. So I thought it may be a good idea to create something that may be useful for myself (and hopefully others).I have been able to track a great number of events with this using ~20 MB of storage and memory which is incredible. I have been really impressed by golang as a language and as an ecosystem and would love to work more in this language going forward.Some Highlights: 1. No dependencies 2. CLI based management 3. Web based UI (and the server to serve it) included in the program. 4. 20 MB install size. 5. 20 MB memory use while running. 6. Minimal storage requirements because it aggregates events.This can be a great fit for anyone who wants to have a lightweight minimal analytics for internal events.I am looking forward to your comments and feedback.
