But after she began listening more closely — especially to nurses — what she heard was an industry full of friction, delays, and burnout.

    "link": "https://share.transistor.fm/s/0c8b6d36",
    "description": "SummaryIn this engaging episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Daniel Koonce and Jeff Amerine welcome Catelyn Hooser, the dynamic founder and owner of Chug NWA—a Farmington-based soda shop that’s stirring up the beverage scene in Northwest Arkansas. From the get-go, Catelyn’s entrepreneurial spirit shines through as she shares the story of how she transformed a mobile soda trailer into a bustling brick-and-mortar storefront. With a background as a hairstylist and a drive to do something different, Catelyn jumped into small business ownership inspired by her father’s example and a desire to carve a unique path. Chug NWA’s menu, full of inventive soda recipes developed by Catelyn and her team, sets it apart from chain competitors like Sonic and Swig. The Cowboy (Dr. Pepper, vanilla, and homemade coconut cream) is a local favorite, alongside “guy-favorite” combos like the Float Trip (root beer, butterscotch, and vanilla).Listeners will love hearing about the challenges and rewards of running both a storefront and a mobile drink truck—from serving teacher appreciation events to handling equipment stress and expanding the menu with soft pretzels to boost revenue.Additionally, Catelyn opens up about balancing entrepreneurship and motherhood, the importance of instilling confidence and skills in her young team, and her long-term vision of expanding—perhaps with her daughter’s help someday. Her advice to herself and other entrepreneurs? “You only grow when you’re uncomfortable—keep grinding and never give up.” For anyone inspired by grassroots business and community, this episode is a must-listen!Show Notes(00:00) Introduction(01:08) About Chug NWA(05:35) Challenges vs Opportunities with a Mobile Truck(08:42) Promoting Efficiency and Speed in Production(11:50) Chug NWA Expansion Plans(15:20) Combating Uncertainty with Optimism(17:03) Embracing Discomfort to Grow(17:31) Closing ThoughtsLinksDaniel KoonceJeff AmerineStartup JunkieStartup Junkie YouTubeCatelyn HooserChug NWA",

    "description": "SummaryIn this engaging episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Caleb Talley and Daniel Koonce sit down with Eric Howerton, serial entrepreneur, co-founder of White Spider, and currently the co-founder of AdFury.ai. The conversation dives into Eric’s journey as an entrepreneur, his approach to solving niche problems in the retail media and advertising space, and the importance of relentless purpose over simple profit-seeking.Eric introduces AdFury.ai, a new SaaS platform that leverages artificial intelligence to automate the creation of highly relevant display and video ads for retailers and agencies. He explains how, while sponsored search advertising is well established, display and video ad creation remains painfully manual, limiting its reach and effectiveness. AdFury automates the process, allowing agencies and brands to quickly scale and personalize creative assets based on keywords, thus increasing efficiency and relevancy for both advertisers and end customers.The episode goes beyond technical discussion, with Eric sharing hard-earned wisdom about what it takes to succeed as a founder. He emphasizes emotional intelligence, resilience, and having a clear sense of purpose, warning that entrepreneurship isn’t for the faint of heart or those simply chasing a lifestyle or wealth. Instead, it’s about being deeply committed to solving real problems and being prepared to persevere through inevitable adversity. Eric’s candid reflections and practical advice make this episode a meaningful listen for anyone considering, or currently navigating the entrepreneurial path.
