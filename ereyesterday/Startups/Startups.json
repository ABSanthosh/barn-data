The episode opens with Daniel’s refreshingly candid take on entering the startup and medtech world with little prior experience, powered mostly by curiosity and grit. Raised in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and later moving to Tulsa, Oklahoma, Daniel built bridges between both cultures and leveraged local gaps in care to inspire his entrepreneurial mission.Skin Check stands at the cutting edge of healthtech, offering an end-to-end digital dermatology platform that expedites access to expert skin care and enables early detection of skin cancer—a disease for which early diagnosis is life-saving. With an app already boasting over one hundred and sixty-five users, Skin Check harnesses AI and computer vision for accurate screenings across all skin tones, making equity a priority both in design and delivery.Daniel shares stories from his early ventures—including building vital medical devices during the COVID-19 ventilator shortage and founding university-based incubators—highlighting his passion for empowering underrepresented innovators. Throughout the episode, what stands out is Daniel’s commitment to democratizing healthcare access, particularly for rural and underserved communities.
