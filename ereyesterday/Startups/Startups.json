    "description": "Summary In this episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Caleb Talley and Daniel Koonce are joined by Phill Shellhammer and Zoe Rose Maddox from the Greenhouse Outdoor Recreation Program (GORP) to discuss the newly launched Arkansas Global Cycling Accelerator and how it’s changing the entrepreneurial landscape in northwest Arkansas and beyond. Phil kicks off the conversation by highlighting the foundational role GORP has played since October 2021 in nurturing early-stage startups in the outdoor recreation space, emphasizing GORP's mission to turn innovative ideas into viable business models rapidly. Zoe then brings attention to the scale of GORP's impact, noting that forty-six companies have participated, with many still active and generating revenue. One of the standout projects discussed in this episode is the Arkansas Global Cycling Accelerator. This program differs from GORP, which focuses primarily on incubating new ideas, by aiming to push established companies to the next level. Zoe explains that the accelerator targets businesses ready to scale, particularly those innovating around cycling technologies, products, and community-building platforms. In a testament to the global reach of their endeavor, Zoe shares that applications have poured in from countries like the Czech Republic, the UK, France, New Zealand, and Korea, underscoring Bentonville’s growing reputation as a hub for cycling innovation. A key insight from the episode is the reflection on overcoming imposter syndrome and embracing curiosity. It's an inspiring reminder for all entrepreneurs to persist and stay passionate about their ventures.

    "description": "Summary En el reciente episodio de nuestro podcast, tuvimos el honor de conversar con Andy Choque, gerente general de Banacorp S.R.L. y miembro de la mesa directiva de la Unión de Bananeros (UNIBAN) en Bolivia.  Andy nos compartió detalles sobre la vida cotidiana de los productores de banano en la región del Chapare, Cochabamba. Desde las primeras horas del día, los agricultores se dedican al cuidado meticuloso de las plantaciones, asegurando que cada planta reciba la atención necesaria para producir frutos de alta calidad. Este arduo trabajo refleja la dedicación y compromiso de los bananeros bolivianos con su tierra y producto. La banana boliviana ha ganado reconocimiento en mercados internacionales por su sabor distintivo y calidad superior. Andy destacó que factores como el clima favorable del Chapare y las prácticas agrícolas sostenibles contribuyen a estas características. Además, la proximidad geográfica a mercados clave en Sudamérica permite una distribución más eficiente y rápida, garantizando que el producto llegue fresco a los consumidores. La industria bananera boliviana ha enfrentado desafíos significativos en los últimos tiempos. Andy mencionó que, debido a bloqueos y conflictos sociales, se han perdido cajas de banano destinadas a la exportación, lo que representa pérdidas económicas considerables para los productores.    Show Notes (00:05) Welcome \u0026 introduction.

    "description": "I’ve been researching how online time services sync over HTTPS, and the results are surprising.Due to network latency \u0026 asymmetry, even widely trusted time sources can drift by ±50ms or more. HTTPS-based synchronization has inherent protocol limitations that prevent true atomic accuracy. Engineers on NTP forums have confirmed that half of RTT (Round Trip Time) is the firm limit—meaning most public clocks are way less accurate than we assume. This raises some serious questions: 1⃣ How bad is the drift in real-world applications? 2⃣ Is there a way to make HTTPS time synchronization truly accurate? 3⃣ Are industries (finance, security, cryptography) unknowingly relying on bad time data?I’m curious if others have tested this or if this is an even bigger problem than we think.Some engineers are experimenting with ways to push accuracy below 10ms, but there’s no widespread solution yet.
