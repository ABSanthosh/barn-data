As avian flu continues to wipe out millions of birds, many egg producers are struggling — but Vital Farms has managed to keep growing. Canseco shares how the brand’s relationship with farmers, transparency with customers, and unique business model has allowed the company to turn crisis into opportunity. He also explores why Vital Farms became a B Corp before its IPO, the company’s high-profile lawsuit with PETA, and what makes Vital Farms’ yolks so orange. Visit the Rapid Response website here: https://www.rapidresponseshow.com/See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",

    "description": "Summary In this episode of Startup Junkies, we dive into the electrifying world of lithium, renewable energy innovations, and its impact on the economy. Hosts Caleb Talley and Jeff Amerine are joined by guests Florence Meaders, program manager of the Lithium Regional Innovation Cluster (LRIC) and Matt Newman and Aviram Hadash from Brightmerge, who explore the profound potential of the Smackover Formation in South Arkansas and the revolutionary technologies shaping the future. One key highlight of the episode was the transformative potential of the Smackover Formation, which has the capacity to supply ten times more lithium than the entire U.S. currently produces. Florence emphasized its unique extraction process—direct lithium extraction (DLE)—which minimizes environmental impact compared to traditional methods. Additionally, Brightmerge’s cutting-edge innovations were also in the spotlight, with CEO, Aviram, detailing how their technology solves key challenges in optimizing electric vehicle (EV) fleet charging and microgrid design. Focusing on tailored, data-driven solutions, their platform helps fleet owners determine optimal charging schedules, equipment, and total cost of ownership (TCO), while factoring in local energy resources and environmental variables. Partnering companies like Volo X amplify their mission to make EV transitions both practical and economical. Matt provided a broader perspective, stressing the importance of diversifying energy sources to accommodate future demands. From smarter lithium usage to energy storage evolution, the conversation stressed the need for strategic partnerships, resource recycling, and advancing battery technology. This episode encapsulates the profound transformation underway in energy and logistics—underscoring innovation, collaboration, and sustainability as key drivers of progress. Tune in to unlock the future of lithium and EV advancements!   Show Notes (00:00) Introduction (05:36) Fleet EV Charging Challenges (10:26) Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Algorithms (14:15) EV Fleet Transition Cost Comparison Tool (17:58) Renewable Energy and Grid Innovation (22:34) Advancements in Solar Energy and Storage (26:46) Future of Lithium vs. Alternatives (31:22) Recruiting Lithium Industry Experts (36:36) Closing Thoughts   Links Caleb Talley Jeff Amerine Startup Junkie Startup Junkie YouTube Aviram Hadash Matt Newman Brightmerge Florence Meaders Lithium Regional Innovation Cluster (LRIC)",

    "description": "Dr. Keith Baar is a Professor at the University of California, Davis in the Department of Physiology and Membrane Biology. During his Ph.D. studies, his research revealed that mechanical strain on muscle fibers activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, a crucial regulator of muscular hypertrophy. Subsequently, he studied the molecular dynamics of skeletal muscle adaptation to endurance training under the guidance of Dr. John Holloszy, a legend in the field of exercise physiology, considered the father of modern exercise biochemistry. Building on all of this experience, he conducted research into tendon health and the potential for engineering ligaments, which could have implications for treatment and recovery from injuries.Sponsors:Cresset prestigious family office for CEOs, founders, and entrepreneurs: https://cressetcapital.com/tim (book a call today)AG1 all-in-one nutritional supplement: https://DrinkAG1.com/Tim (1-year supply of Vitamin D (and 5 free AG1 travel packs) with your first subscription purchase.)Shopify global commerce platform, providing tools to start, grow, market, and manage a retail business: https://shopify.com/tim (one-dollar-per-month trial period)*Links to everything discussed: https://tim.blog/2025/02/26/dr-keith-baar/Timestamps:[00:00:00] Start [00:07:12] How I discovered Keith’s work through a tweet about tennis elbow and rock climbing.[00:07:54] Emil Abrahamsson’s hangboard training protocol.[00:09:20] The fundamental principles of strength training and connective tissue adaptation.[00:10:36] mTOR complex 1 and its role in muscle growth.[00:12:06] Engineered ligaments and the discovery of minimal effective doses for tendon adaptation.[00:13:50] The refractory period between optimal tendon loading sessions.[00:16:42] Rapamycin’s effects on muscle hypertrophy.[00:18:49] Protocols for tennis elbow rehabilitation.[00:20:28] Why isometrics work better than eccentrics for tendon healing.[00:22:14] Stress shielding and how load distribution affects tendon healing.[00:29:07] The misconception about eccentric loading for tendon injuries and why velocity matters.[00:29:58] Ideal duration for isometric holds (10-30 seconds) based on injury status.[00:33:50] My elbow issues and current rehab approach.[00:36:02] Overcoming vs. yielding isometrics and optimal loading strategies.[00:47:11] Dr. Barr’s movement prescription for my tennis elbow.[00:52:18] Loading timing post-surgery and RICE protocol criticism.[00:56:58] Achilles tendon rehabilitation after surgery.[01:00:18] Critique of orthopedic suturing techniques and recommendation for resorbable sutures.[01:04:02] Multiple position isometrics for tennis elbow rehabilitation.[01:07:26] Collagen synthesis, supplementation, and vitamin C timing.[01:12:59] Critique of BPC-157 and other injectable peptides for tendon healing.[01:18:19] Evaluation of orthobiologics’ (PRP, prolotherapy, stem cells) effectiveness.[01:21:37] JAK-STAT inhibitor drugs and their effects on tendon growth.[01:25:35] Drugs that increase risk of tendon ruptures (fluoroquinolones, AT-1 receptor drugs).[01:29:33] How estrogen affects tendon stiffness and injury risk in women.[01:32:48] Testosterone’s opposite effects on tendon compared to estrogen.[01:35:31] Protein intake recommendations and timing.[01:40:11] Ketogenic diet effects on mitochondrial biogenesis and longevity.[01:41:57] Comparison of ketogenic diet, low protein diet, and rapamycin for longevity.[01:47:19] Inflammation’s role in adaptation and when to reduce it.[01:51:17] Timing of ice baths relative to training for optimal recovery.[01:52:33] Parting thoughts.*For show notes and past guests on The Tim Ferriss Show, please visit tim.blog/podcast.For deals from sponsors of The Tim Ferriss Show, please visit tim.blog/podcast-sponsorsSign up for Tim’s email newsletter (5-Bullet Friday) at tim.blog/friday.For transcripts of episodes, go to tim.blog/transcripts.Discover Tim’s books: tim.blog/books.Follow Tim:Twitter: twitter.com/tferriss Instagram: instagram.com/timferrissYouTube: youtube.com/timferrissFacebook: facebook.com/timferriss LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/timferrissPast guests on The Tim Ferriss Show include Jerry Seinfeld, Hugh Jackman, Dr. Jane Goodall, LeBron James, Kevin Hart, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Jamie Foxx, Matthew McConaughey, Esther Perel, Elizabeth Gilbert, Terry Crews, Sia, Yuval Noah Harari, Malcolm Gladwell, Madeleine Albright, Cheryl Strayed, Jim Collins, Mary Karr, Maria Popova, Sam Harris, Michael Phelps, Bob Iger, Edward Norton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Neil Strauss, Ken Burns, Maria Sharapova, Marc Andreessen, Neil Gaiman, Neil de Grasse Tyson, Jocko Willink, Daniel Ek, Kelly Slater, Dr. Peter Attia, Seth Godin, Howard Marks, Dr. Brené Brown, Eric Schmidt, Michael Lewis, Joe Gebbia, Michael Pollan, Dr. Jordan Peterson, Vince Vaughn, Brian Koppelman, Ramit Sethi, Dax Shepard, Tony Robbins, Jim Dethmer, Dan Harris, Ray Dalio, Naval Ravikant, Vitalik Buterin, Elizabeth Lesser, Amanda Palmer, Katie Haun, Sir Richard Branson, Chuck Palahniuk, Arianna Huffington, Reid Hoffman, Bill Burr, Whitney Cummings, Rick Rubin, Dr. Vivek Murthy, Darren Aronofsky, Margaret Atwood, Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel, Dr. Gabor Maté, Anne Lamott, Sarah Silverman, Dr. Andrew Huberman, and many more.See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
