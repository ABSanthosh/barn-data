Photo: Michael O'Donnell Photography Join the event trusted by enterprise leaders for nearly two decades. VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy. Learn more Palo Alto-based Catio was awarded “Coolest Technology” at VentureBeat Transform 2025 in San Francisco on Wednesday. Founded in 2023, the company has raised $7 million to date, with a recent $3 million round announced in March. Catio was also a finalist and presented at VB Transform’s Innovation Showcase in 2024. Catio’s AI Copilot for Tech Architecture reframes architecture as a living system—one that can be codified, introspected and intelligently evolved. By combining a real-time architectural map with a multi-agent AI organization, the solution helps engineering teams shift from reactive decision-making to continuous, proactive architecture excellence. VentureBeat spoke with co-founder and CEO Boris Bogatin and product lead Adam Kirsh about their team and the company’s technology following the announcement of winners at Transform. “We’re a team of serial entrepreneurs and tech leaders who’ve all shared a deep personal problem,” Bogatin said. “While finance folks and developers all have tools, CTOs, architects, and developers all plan and optimize stacks on whiteboards and ad hoc spreadsheets. And we’re changing that with Catio.”  Catio is far more than a digital whiteboard for CTOs—it’s a reimagining of how architecture is understood, managed and evolved. The platform serves as a digital twin for your tech stack, offering continuous architecture visibility to inform more well-informed, data-driven architecture decisions. Designed to address the escalating complexity of modern tech stacks—including cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, monitoring and data pipelines—the platform replaces static diagrams and ad hoc snapshots with an interactive, high-fidelity system model. With Catio, architecture becomes a living, codified system—constantly updated, evaluated and advised by a network of intelligent AI agents. From static diagrams to living systems As an AI-driven tech stack copilot for technical leaders and engineering teams, Catio delivers real-time expert insights and actionable recommendations to help evaluate, plan and optimize infrastructure with clarity and confidence. The solution integrates with your existing technology stack—services like AWS, Kubernetes, Prometheus and more. Once connected, Stacks—its first core module—creates a comprehensive model of your entire environment. Unlike traditional architecture diagrams, this model is codified, versioned and continuously updated, living in code rather than PowerPoint slides. Source: catio.tech. This dynamic architecture model allows teams to interact with their stack as a navigable system. Each component is introspectable: What is this RDS instance doing? Is it optimized for cost or performance? Does it still meet business requirements? With Catio, these questions are no longer answered in meetings or siloed email threads; instead, they are built into the platform. A multi-agent AI system to close the loop on architecture The solution includes a multi-agent AI system designed to reflect the structure of a typical technical organization. It consists of 31 specialized agents, each modeled after common roles such as chief architect, data architect, messaging architect, product managers and beyond. These agents collaborate to assess the design and performance of the system architecture against the requirements and best practices. Together, they simulate the design review processes that typically require weeks of coordination or the involvement of external consultants. But instead of periodic reviews, Catios agents are always working, performing 24/7 analysis to help you evolve your architecture in real time. Also, Catio doesn’t just describe your architecture—it actively critiques it. The solution delivers gap analysis, pinpoints underperforming components and suggests targeted improvements aligned with your business goals. Whether it’s optimizing a data pipeline, overhauling your messaging infrastructure, or rethinking storage architecture, the platform provides actionable insights at every layer of the stack. The future At Transform, Catio also announced the upcoming launch of Archie, a conversational, multi-agent AI system. Archie will allow users to talk to their architecture and ask for advice—for example, a “how do I improve my security posture?” query will yield clear, actionable answers—such as guidance to pinpoint exactly where a specific security vulnerability exists within your architecture. Archie delivers both prescriptive guidance and reactive insights. If you’re aiming to optimize costs, for instance, its AI agents will surface opportunities and assess the business impact of each one. This makes it easier to connect every architectural decision to measurable ROI, helping you design and plan with greater precision—so your technical choices consistently support real business goals.To learn more about Catio’s team and technology, visit their website at catio.tech. You can also sign up for demo and get a first-hand look at the platform in action. Read about the other winners CTGT and Solo.io. The other finalists were Kumo, Superduper.io, Sutro and Qdrant. Editor’s note: As a thank-you to our readers, we’ve opened up early bird registration for VB Transform 2026 — just $200. This is where AI ambition meets operational reality, and you’re going to want to be in the room. Reserve your spot now.
