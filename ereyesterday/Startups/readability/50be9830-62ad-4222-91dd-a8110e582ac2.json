However, these initiatives are often far away from the day-to-day operations of a company, and a lack of transparency makes it hard for businesses to know if they’re really making a difference. Now, Carbon Less Future (CLF) is putting the power back in hands these companies. Instead of donating to a faraway environmental initiative, CLF offers businesses a transparent tree-growing container that allows them to grow seedlings on their premises. This way, companies and their employees can be directly engaged in reforestation efforts and witness the tree growth for themselves. As COO Aigars Jacuks explained to Springwise: “This not only provides a visually appealing environmental object but also serves as an educational tool and a powerful PR statement for sustainability.” CLF’s offering is an all-in-on-service, so it manages everything from manufacturing and installing the container to container maintenance and supporting tree growth in its vertical farming containers. Cultivating the trees in these controlled environments, with the right levels of light, fertiliser, water, and fresh air, means they grow much faster than on the outside, where extreme weather can compromise seed growth. Once the saplings have matured, they can be donated to outdoor reforestation projects. Next, the Latvia-based company plans on scaling up production and is looking to secure investment to help make its containers more widely available, as well as develop partnerships with corporations, government bodies, and environmental organisations. Jacuks told Springwise: “Ultimately, our goal is to be a player in large-scale reforestation and a transparent partner for companies committed to genuine sustainability.” Written By: Matilda Cox 13th November 2024 Website: clf.earth Contact: clf.earth/contact",
