  "text": "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on Thursday that Amazon sellers would probably respond to President Donald Trump's tariffs by raising prices for consumers.\"I think they [sellers] will try and pass the cost on,\" Jassy told CNBC in an interview.Trump levied a 10% tariff on all trading partners and an \"at least\" 145% tariff on China earlier this week that could impact consumer prices. The tariff news has thrown Amazon sellers into a panic because the majority of goods on the platform, up to 70% of products per Wedbush Securities estimates, come from China.
