While AI could take over jobs on Wall Street or software developer roles at Big Tech firms, a recent Pew Research survey found that AI experts deem three professions most at risk of vanishing in the next 20 years due to AI: cashiers, journalists, and factory workers.Pew Research surveyed over 5,400 U.S. adults and more than 1,000 AI experts who spoke or presented at 21 AI-related conferences in 2023 or 2024.\"It's really important that both of these sets of views are in the room,\" Jeff Gottfried, Pew's associate director of research, told CNBC.Related: Worried About AI Stealing Your Job?

More than half of the public said they were anxious about AI causing job loss, while only 25% of experts were concerned. Meanwhile, the majority of U.S. adults (64%) said that AI would lead to fewer jobs, but only 39% of experts shared the same outlook.
