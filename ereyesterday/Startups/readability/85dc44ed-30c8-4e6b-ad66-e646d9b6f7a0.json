  "text": "Readers were not amused recently when they discovered that two novelists had used artificial intelligence to help them write their books. It didn’t take an AI detector or a human hunch about AI’s favorite words and phrases to uncover the truth. Instead, the evidence was right there on the pages. AI prompts were inadvertently left in the published novels. It was a cringeworthy oversight and a lesson for others. AI can be useful, but allowing it to write a book for you isn’t a path you should want to follow.  This is especially true for thought leaders seeking to establish their authority through publishing. When thought leaders produce books, they don’t make things up, like fiction writers. They also don’t draw solely from the work and ideas of others. Instead, they tend to do the following:   Include personal lessons learned through their experiences and research  Forecast challenges ahead and explore new paradigms  Share industry advice with readers from a position of authority   They sometimes use (human) ghostwriters to help with the technical aspects of writing and organizing a book, but the ideas, vision, experiences, and lessons remain theirs. For such authors, using AI to write their books would not only be a questionable tactic, but would undermine the very thing they hope to accomplish. Thought leaders versus AI A thought leader, by definition, is someone with a unique perspective to share with the world. As they teach others how to overcome obstacles and succeed, thought leaders draw on challenges they personally have overcome and practical knowledge they have gained through their lived experiences.  In contrast, AI just remixes existing information, bringing nothing new, innovative, or surprising to the topic. In reality, AI doesn’t even write. It calculates. It recognizes patterns in language somewhat like a mathematician recognizes patterns in numbers. AI then writes by placing one word after the other in a logical order.  Yes, AI can mimic an expert, but thought leaders are not just experts on their topics, providing how-tos and best practices. They are visionaries. Thought leaders bring new ideas and insights to the discussion, challenging the status quo. Where AI can help However, AI does have a role to play for authors.  While you don’t want it to write your book, AI can add efficiencies to some of your processes. For example, AI can help you research what else is out there on your topic so you can determine what you need to do to add a new and interesting perspective to the existing literature. AI can help create an outline for a book plan, which you would flesh out before writing the book.  You might even ask AI to help you determine the audience for your book—that is, the types of readers most likely to be drawn to the topic, and therefore the ones you would want to target in your marketing. Even when you put AI to work, though, you can’t disregard the need to bring in the human element, which is you. That outline, for example, likely will be a helpful but imperfect guide to what you want to accomplish with a book plan. You will want to review it, tweak it, rework it, and mold it into an even better outline. AI can give you eight or nine types of readers when determining your book’s potential target audience, but is it correct in every case?  You may need to refine the list, using your experience and knowledge about your topic to disregard some of those groups and perhaps even add one that AI didn’t consider. Only you can see things from your unique perspective. The risk of hallucinations Most people know by now that you can’t trust everything AI gives you with research. Double-check AI’s facts and make sure any books, research papers, or surveys it cites actually exist.  You may have recently read about several newspapers publishing an AI-generated summer reading list that included books that were AI hallucinations. In other words, AI made them up.  Ultimately, you need to remain in the driver’s seat and use AI responsibly as a helpful tool, not something you allow to usurp your authority and accountability. To achieve that, the answer isn’t to feed a few general thoughts into an AI and prompt it to spit out 40,000 words on your topic that you can claim as your book. Sure, that would work in a technical sense for a person whose only goal is to claim to be an “author.” But it is not an acceptable route for someone seeking to build their credibility and authority.  If you are a thought leader or aspire to be one, your book’s content should be original, aligned with your brand, and add to the body of knowledge in your field. You want to become known as a source of new, valuable information to your audience. Don’t let yourself and your readers settle for something artificial. Use your human strengths—creative thinking, storytelling, and the ability to make a personal connection with readers—to bring into existence something special that only you can create. The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
