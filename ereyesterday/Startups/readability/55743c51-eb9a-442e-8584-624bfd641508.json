How can you distill your entire professional journey into just a few sentences?How do you highlight your professional skills and accomplishments in a way that quickly captures readers’ attention? One way to compose an outstanding professional bio is by referencing business bio examples from fellow professionals.Professional Bio ExamplesProfessional bios come in all shapes and forms. Some are brief and to the point, while others tell lengthy stories. What do you want to tell profile visitors or a potential employer, and what platform do you want to use? From an entrepreneur’s Instagram bio to a Twitter bio, you have more options than ever. The following professional bio examples will help you write a business bio that engages readers.Chima MmejeBio Platform: LinkedIn ProfileIn her LinkedIn bio, freelance writer and content strategist Chima Mmeje impresses readers with a lengthy list of accomplishments. While many users’ LinkedIn Page looks more like traditional resume with lists of positions held, Mmeje’s LinkedIn summary focuses more on what she can do for clients and less on her every career move.Van JonesBio Platform: Twitter ProfileBecause of its character limit, Twitter can be a difficult profile on which to build an effective business bio. When writing a Twitter bio, professionals should focus on the keywords they want other users to know about them. A catchy tagline can be used to grab ahold of readers’ attention. In his Twitter profile bio, CNN’s Van Jones clearly and succinctly tells users who he is, and what he’s done.Lena AxelssonBio Platform: Industry WebsiteMany industry professionals know their professional bios are how many clients are introduced to them and their services. In her business bio at Psychology Today, marriage and family therapist Lena Axelsson introduced her practice with a core belief rather than a personal statement. She then explains how that belief impacts her passion for healing sufferers of trauma.Rebecca BollwittBio Platform: InstagramLike on Twitter, Instagram bios can be a challenge to write because the platform limits the number of characters that can be used. How do you write a short business bio that adequately interests readers? Author Rebecca Bollwitt expanded the ideas she could communicate in her brief Instagram bio by infusing emojis into her statements, each expressing ideas in a single character.Chris BurkardBio Platform: LinkedInStories inherently attract people’s attention, making storytelling a powerful method for capturing readers’ interest in a business bio. Photographer Chris Burkard uses his LinkedIn bio to narrate the journey of his career and achievements instead of simply presenting them in a tedious block of text.Tim CookBio Platform: Company WebsiteApple CEO Tim Cook‘s professional bio on the company’s website serves as an excellent example of a conventional yet impactful business profile. The large profile photo allows audiences to connect a name with a face, while the concise bio effectively highlights the key milestones in Cook’s career.Lisa QuineBio Platform: Personal WebsiteA business bio is an important component of any online portfolio. Whether it’s showcasing visual arts, written work or another craft, website visitors want to know the creator. Artist and creative consultant Lisa Quine‘s personal website features a portfolio of her work and an effective business bio that introduces her to audiences.Professional Bio TemplateYou don’t need to be a skilled writer to create an effective professional bio. Most business bios, even most of the best examples, follow a certain formula. The following can serve as a template for writing your own professional bio:(NAME) is a (JOB TITLE) at (COMPANY NAME), where (NAME) (VERB – include an action verb that describes what you do) (NOUN – include a noun that describes what you produce) for the past (NUMBER) years, including (TASK1), (TASK2) and (TASK3).(NAME) has (ACCOMPLISHMENT1) and (ACCOMPLISHMENT2), among other industry distinctions. (NAME) can help you meet your target goals in the (INDUSTRY TYPE) industry. (NAME) currently resides in (PLACE), where (s)he enjoys (HOBBY) and (INTEREST).Short Bio ExamplesMany platforms require professionals to provide concise bios that adhere to a character limit. Some individuals choose to write shorter bios to effectively convey their message to readers. The following business bio examples will assist you in crafting your own brief professional summary.Audra SimpsonBio Platform: Company websiteProfessional bios are an important component of a company website. Who represents your organization? In her business bio for Columbia University, anthropology professor Audra Simpson clearly communicates her professional biography and research interests.Corey WainwrightBio Platform: Company WebsiteIt’s possible to capture readers’ attention and describe a professional career in just a couple of sentences. In her short business bio for Hubspot, blogger Corey Wainwright tells audiences the two most important things to know about her, covering personal interests and career accomplishments in just a few words.Megan GilmoreBio Platform: InstagramWhen you only have a few characters to compose your professional bio, it’s important to make every word count. Cookbook author Megan Gilmore effectively describes her career in just a few short words on her Instagram profile. She helps communicate ideas using emojis and strategically directs readers to her website, where they can learn more details.Ann HandleyBio Platform: Personal WebsiteAuthor and professional content marketer Ann Handley knows how to make a statement. Her professional bio, listed on her professional website, uses bold and colorful text to capture readers’ attention. Website visitors quickly can grasp her accomplishments and her personal interests.Sarah HaskinsBio Platform: TwitterSarah Haskins‘ Twitter profile boasts one of the shortest and sweetest business bios found on any platform. In just five words, the writer lets users know who she is and what she does. You can’t get much clearer than that.Longer Bio ExamplesThere are plenty of reasons to write short bios, but some situations call for greater detail. If a platform provides enough space, a longer business bio can include information about professional philosophy, personal life, and professional accomplishments.The following longer bio examples demonstrate how a business profile can tell a greater story than simply writing resumes.Mark LevyBio Platform: Company WebsiteConsultant Mark Levy features his bio twice on his company website, with each version emphasizing different facets of his business and personal journey. The first entry presents his credentials in a few concise paragraphs, while the second business bio offers a more in-depth and engaging narrative about the small business owner’s career, incorporating elements of humor.Wonbo WooBio Platform: Personal WebsiteYou might expect a unique personal brand and professional bio from a content producer, and WIRED’s Wonbo Woo doesn’t disappoint. He includes a longer bio on his personal website. In it, he tells the story of his impressive career, and he doesn’t fail to drop plenty of names of the celebrities with whom he’s worked.Creative Business Bio ExamplesAn effective business bio doesn’t have to come from a template. In fact, if you’re skilled at creative writing, you can grab a reader’s attention and impress potential clients with a creative business bio on your company page or various social media platforms. The following creative business bio examples can serve as a guide.DJ NexusBio Platform: Personal WebsiteAn effective bio can come in a variety of forms. On his website, DJ Nexus dedicates an entire page to the story of his career. The New England-based DJ doesn’t just list professional details, however, he also provides enough personal information to tell readers who he is.Pei Jung HoBio Platform: Personal WebsiteYou might expect a unique and creative professional bio from an artist, and Pei Jung Ho definitely meets that expectation. The professional designer doesn’t simply boast a website with some accomplishments and job descriptions. Ho’s personal website opens with an animated statement in colorful and bold lettering before transitioning to a more traditional short bio and an engaging photo of the artist.Nancy TwineBio Platform: Company WebsiteBriogeo Hair Care founder Nancy Twine’s professional bio immediately grabs readers’ attention with her signature and photo before telling Twine’s story. The entrepreneur’s business bio doesn’t end there. It also highlights a quote from Twine, which illustrates her professional philosophy, and it even features video content.Trinity MouzonBio Platform: Personal WebsiteEntrepreneur Trinity Mouzon‘s professional bio tells far more about her than her job title and primary responsibilities. Mouzon makes a strong personal statement in the first sentence of her bio, which she presents in first person, telling her own story. In just a couple of paragraphs, Mouzon captures her professional essence and offers unique insight into her success.Alex BishopBio Platform: Company WebsiteIn his professional bio, guitar maker Alex Bishop radiates his passion for his craft. Accompanied by an artistic and engaging video, Bishop presents a business bio that resonates with his target audience, offering more than just a summary of his professional experience. His story instills trust in potential clients, showcasing his genuine passion for guitars, his brand, and his small business.Author Bio ExamplesAuthors have been impressing their readers with professional bios centuries before anyone heard of the World Wide Web. Today, it’s not uncommon for authors to have websites and social media profiles promoting their works, complete with creative business bios that might or might not mirror the bios printed in their books.Chimamanda Ngozi AdichieBio Platform: Personal WebsiteAuthor Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie‘s personal website speaks to her target audience with a traditional business bio. In it, Adichie tells the story of her background, including her childhood in Nigeria and her educational journey.

In his professional author’s bio on Amazon, Michael Siemsen details his interests, accomplishments, and popular works in a few brief sentences.What are the essential components of professional bios?An effective professional bio is typically more creative than a conventional resume. However, you can craft a brief bio utilizing much of the same information, such as your work history, newly acquired skills, and professional achievements.The following are six essential elements of an effective business bio:Name and job titleEducational backgroundWork historyProfessional accomplishmentsInterests and hobbiesLocation or contact informationHow do you make your bio interesting?How do you make your professional bio more interesting? After all, no one is going to be impressed by yet another series of monotonous bullet points. You can add some extra pizzazz to your bio by including a more personal side, as well.Are you looking to enhance your bio with details that aren’t on your resume? Consider incorporating elements like your professional philosophy or a personal statement that reflects your career passions.

For more inspiration, check out various business bio examples.Should I write a bio in the third person?A professional bio can be written in first person or in third person. Professional and more formal bios are often written in third person, while personal and more casual bios typically use first person.It’s vital, however, that the chosen tense is consistent throughout the bio. For example, if the bio starts off in third person, referencing the subject by name and using pronouns such as “he,” “she” and “they,” then it’s important to continue using third person throughout the entire entry.If, however, you start your bio by referencing yourself as, “I,” or using first person, then that should remain consistent, as well.Image: Depositphotos",
