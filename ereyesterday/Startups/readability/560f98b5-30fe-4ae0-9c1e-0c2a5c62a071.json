  "text": "At some point, you probably wanted to be cool. Maybe it was in middle school gym class, or maybe it was just last week at the company offsite. Cool has a gravitational pull—the polished, confident, nonchalant allure of the person who never seems to try but always ends up ahead.  I wanted to be cool so badly. But in evidence of the universe having my back, new social science research reveals that being cool may not be all it’s cracked up to be, especially if you care about connection, trust, and long-term workplace success. Keep reading to learn more about the science behind cool—and why awkwardness, the thing you were taught to avoid, might be the skill your business actually needs. What the research really says about being coolA sweeping new global study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology analyzed perceptions of coolness across nearly 6,000 participants from 13 countries. The goal was to pin down the traits that make someone cool, and find out whether that perception shifts across cultures. Spoiler: The perceptions are wildly consistent. Cool people, the researchers found, are perceived to be extroverted, hedonistic, powerful, adventurous, open, and autonomous. These six traits held steady across geography, age, and culture—from Kiev to Carolina and Berlin down to Belize (I told you I wasn’t cool).But cool, it turns out, has gone global. Here’s where it gets interesting. Researchers asked participants not only to name someone they thought was cool, but also someone they thought was good. People admired the good ones too, but for different reasons. Goodness was associated with warmth, agreeableness, conscientiousness, calm, and universalism (in other words, caring about the welfare of others). In short: Cool gets attention. Good earns trust. What’s missing from cool? Emotional exposureCool, as defined in the study, leans heavily on self-possession: power, independence, and a touch of rebellion. What’s missing? In my field of work, it’s emotional exposure—the willingness to be visibly human. In the workplace, that’s not optional. It’s core to how you build trust, speak up, and collaborate, and it’s almost always awkward. You’ve probably felt it: the silence after you pitch an idea, the strained “got a sec?” before a tough conversation, the social static when you’re trying to connect across departments or power dynamics. Those are the moments when awkwardness makes its entrance. Not as a flaw but as a signal. It’s what shows up when something real happens. The trouble is, most people haven’t been taught how to handle it. The power of awkwardness at work In my own 2025 national study of working Americans, I found that one of the most overlooked barriers to performance wasn’t burnout or bandwidth. It was something I call social muscle atrophy—a slow erosion of the ability to engage meaningfully with others. It shows up in the reluctance to ask for help, the habit of defaulting to AI over analog, or skipping the hard conversations altogether. Over time, those small hesitations compound, and the ripple effects hit culture, morale, and even retention. In fact, turnover was the most frequently reported consequence tied to weakened social muscles in the data. However, there’s good news: Those muscles can be rebuilt, and the training ground is awkwardness. Embracing what I call the “good awkward”—I even wrote a book about it—is the cost of entry for connection. It’s what happens when you show up before you’ve perfected your pitch or speak up before you’ve figured out how to land the dismount. One stat from my study still makes me pause: 30 percent of people said they’d rather clean a toilet than ask a co-worker for help. Not because they don’t want support but because asking feels uncertain, vulnerable, and unavoidably awkward. Avoiding those moments doesn’t keep things clean. It keeps things disconnected. A cultural hangover that needs to be shaken The cool ideal, as the new study shows, is deeply embedded across cultures. It’s a cocktail of power, freedom, and pleasure. Think James Dean, Beyoncé, or the startup founder who wears that trendy new hoodie to a board meeting. But that image also comes with a side effect: emotional detachment. The original roots of cool emphasized restraint—calm under pressure, impassive face, no visible emotion. That legacy still lingers. A person who never gets flustered still earns admiration. In today’s workplace, that’s a missed opportunity. Emotional detachment might look slick but it rarely inspires trust. It keeps interactions polite but never personal. Safe but never meaningful. What teams need isn’t more poise. They desperately need more presence. So what’s the better bet? If you’re trying to build teams that perform under pressure and a workplace that thrives on trust and resilience, cool isn’t enough. What actually moves the needle is courage. Specifically, the courage to risk a little awkwardness in service of something better. It’s not the polished, breezy moments that build high-performing teams. It’s the ones where people show up unsure, ask anyway, and stay in the room when it gets uncomfortable. Those are the moments that spark creativity, strengthen relationships, and turn co-workers into collaborators. Cool turns heads, but awkward builds bridges. In a world that’s moving fast and breaking things, bridges matter more than swagger. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc.
