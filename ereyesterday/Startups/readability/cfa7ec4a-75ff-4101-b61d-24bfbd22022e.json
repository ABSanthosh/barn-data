  "text": "The U.S. has a long history of initiating and funding development banks around the world, such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and African Development Bank, all of which were designed to grow economies in their time. But those are institutions of the last century.  It’s time to create new institutions for a new era to advance economic growth, starting in America: entrepreneurial development banks.The 20th century required investments in last century’s hard infrastructure, like roads, dams, electricity, clean water, telecom, big industry, even stock markets. The 21st century requires nimble capital to invest in entrepreneurial capabilities. The world’s development institutions have not adapted overall to the needs of the new economy. It’s time we change how the U.S. thinks about development.Today, economic growth comes largely from new and young businesses, which create virtually all net job growth in America. Yet most U.S. development institutions still operate as they did last century. The U.S. has not begun to maximize the economic potential of unleashing the entrepreneurial energy of its people. In other words, people are the new power plants. It’s people, after all, who invent, create, innovate, and build better goods and services. Focusing on entrepreneurship would have multiple wide-ranging benefits for all Americans, not just entrepreneurs.Why entrepreneurial development banksResearch in the U.S. shows that for every 1 percent increase in the entrepreneurship rate, the poverty rate decreases by 2 percent. New businesses are also leading indicators of GDP growth, and every new business per 100 people adds nearly $500 to average household income in a county, according to data from GoDaddy Venture Forward, a partner of my nonprofit Right to Start.In addition, Americans want the opportunity. A recent survey conducted by a bipartisan team of pollsters for Right to Start found that 43 percent of voters have thought about starting a new business, but only 21 percent have tried. What’s more, 54 percent of Black voters have thought about starting a business, as have 50 percent of Hispanic voters and 40 percent of White voters. Perhaps most telling, 76 percent of people who considered starting a business but never followed through said lack of access to capital was a factor.  Financial infrastructureWhat’s needed now is a more robust financial infrastructure for entrepreneurs across America. But there is a challenge. More than 4 in 5 entrepreneurs don’t access traditional capital markets through venture capital or banking when starting a business. Venture capital focuses on fast-growing tech companies. Banking focuses on older, larger companies with physical assets.  Who’s left behind? The vast majority of new businesses today. They are served by neither banking nor venture capital. Entrepreneurs need a range of new financial options. Entrepreneurial development banks—across national, state, and even local levels—could help provide those options by spurring innovative private-sector capital formation. Some options, which are discussed further in Right to Start’s “Field Guides for Policymakers,” include the following:Revenue-based investing or profit sharingFunds can be created with innovative investment models, such as revenue-based investing or profit sharing. Local-level examples include Collab Capital in Atlanta, Novel Growth Partners in Kansas City, Kansas, and Founders First in San Diego. While these types of funds are becoming more popular, they are still an emerging sector. When I served at the nonprofit Kauffman Foundation, we created an investment vehicle to support funds like these with a combination of private and philanthropic dollars. Government already supports breakthrough innovations through institutions like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, better known as Darpa, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, known as Barda. It could play a similar role in sparking innovative capital models. Selling loan portfoliosSmall-business microlenders can sell loan portfolios to commercial banks, freeing up money to invest in more entrepreneurs. Examples include Scale Link, which has purchased 3,500 loans and resold $36.7 million of those loans to bank partners. Building a secondary market like this requires validation and momentum. Government can play a significant role as a large institutional actor. Think about how the federal government created the secondary mortgage market through Fannie Mae and how that made home buying possible for millions of Americans. The U.S. could make a similar impact in the entrepreneurial capital markets.NonprofitsNonprofit evergreen funding models could invest in new enterprises and recycle funds continuously. Statewide examples include MassVentures in Massachusetts, the JumpStart Evergreen Fund in Ohio, and New Hampshire’s Community Loan Fund. Private capital by its nature is volatile due to macroeconomic forces—like inflation, tariffs, bubbles, and politics—that don’t necessarily correlate to the real potential of a new business. It’s good for America that entrepreneurs keep starting and growing businesses through thick and thin, but there is a need for small-scale capital that is steady, patient, and dependable. Nonprofit, evergreen funds are one way to provide a steady hand on the financial rudder for little startups in stormy seas.New fund formationFunds that invest in catalyzing new fund formation could amplify impact. Examples include Renaissance Venture Capital in Michigan, the Yozma Fund in Israel, and the Multilateral Investment Fund in Latin America. Many people don’t realize that the venture capital industry in Israel, arguably the most successful in the world on a per capita basis, was initially sparked by government funds. Public capital can indeed spark private capital successfully. But it has to be executed well, with financial professionalism, no political interference, and no bureaucratic red tape. With about 70 percent of venture capital in the U.S. concentrated in only three states, most of America could benefit from similar efforts to spark capital formation that is more evenly distributed.One of the great advantages of entrepreneurship is that new businesses can be started and grown in every community in the nation. That geographic breadth can never be reached through traditional economic development tools to attract and subsidize large companies. To achieve the full entrepreneurial potential of the nation, we need a broad range of financial vehicles, so that every community has access to the needed capital.One useful model is the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation. An entrepreneurial development bank could be, in effect, a domestic version of it. The DFC develops financial infrastructure to build capital markets abroad. It spurs private-sector activity in places where it’s not happening on its own. A similar strategy domestically could help spread entrepreneurial opportunity to every community in the nation.Entrepreneurial energyNext year marks the 250th anniversary of the country’s founding, America’s startup. What better moment to ensure that every American has the means to start their own business some day and access the needed financial resources?This shared aspiration is deep in the American DNA and provides a rare example of national unity. The bipartisan survey reveals that U.S. voters nearly unanimously agree that “it is important to America’s future that citizens have a fair opportunity to start and grow their own business.” Consider: 94 percent agree, just 2 percent disagree, and only 4 percent are not sure.In marking America’s semiquincentennial, policymakers should respond to voters’ desire for that “fair opportunity” by creating entrepreneurial development banks across the U.S. All Americans would benefit.",
