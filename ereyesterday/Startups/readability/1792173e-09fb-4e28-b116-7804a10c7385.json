  "text": "Guy Kawasaki has spent years observing the leadership styles and business tactics of top CEOs and Silicon Valley “assholes.” But these experiences actually taught him exactly what it takes to be someone who can make a difference, he says — and be truly “remarkable.”   Now, it’s his mission is to share those learnings with others, says Kawasaki, who currently serves as chief evangelist at Canva, the Australian graphic design software company. Speaking with Inc. editor-at-large Christine Haughney Dare-Bryan on the main stage at the 2024 Inc. 5000 Conference, Kawasaki said he’s especially focused on helping entrepreneurs, who he believes have “a special place in the world… you’re making the world a better place.”   Kawasaki was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. Thanks to the urging of his sixth-grade teacher, his parents sacrificed to send him to private school, which put him on the path toward college, he says. He earned admission at Stanford University, where he made valuable connections that ultimately led him to a job at Apple. Today, Kawasaki is the author of 16 books: in addition to his role at Canva, he is the host of the Remarkable People podcast, through which he’s interviewed the likes of Jane Goodall and Steve Wozniak. Here’s what he’s learned from those conversations, and from his career, about how leaders can make a remarkable impact:   Jump curves   At Apple, Kawasaki worked under co-founder Steve Jobs, who taught him that impact isn’t made by small, incremental improvements: “If you want to make a difference in the world, you don’t do things 10 or 15 percent better.” Instead, Kawasaki says, Jobs advocated for “jump[ing] to the next curve.” Kawasaki points to the history of ice making as an example: that industry has evolved from ice harvesting in frozen lakes, to the construction of large ice factories, to the development of the “personal ice factory,” aka the refrigerator.   Each of those revolutionary changes was critical, Kawasaki says: “I learned from Steve Jobs [that] the big changes, the big money, the big everything, is made by jumping curves, not making a slightly better ice factory.”     Stay mission-driven   While Kawasaki shared with attendees that he would not be where he is without Jobs’ influence, he conceded: “Steve Jobs was an asshole.”   He’s seen that same trait time and time again in Silicon Valley, he says — but notes there is an important distinction: “I figured out the two kinds of assholes. One asshole is all about himself or herself… Another kind of asshole is the mission-driven asshole.”   The latter, Kawasaki says, characterized Jobs. And while he believes you don’t need to be an asshole to be successful, he says being “mission-driven” is still key. It can even impact the talent you bring on board to help your company grow, Kawasaki says. “If you’re mission driven, you ignore the superficialities about sexual orientation and religion and skin color and gender and all that,” he says. “All you care about [is]: can you contribute to the mission? Or can you not?”   Embrace growth and grit   One of Kawasaki’s podcast guests, Carol Dweck, has spearheaded research on the “growth mindset,” which he says describes people who “believe they can do new things, they can get new skills, they can start companies.”   This, he says, likely describes most entrepreneurs. But impactful leaders also need the “grit mindset,” he adds, which requires embracing vulnerability and failure.   Kawasaki strives to embrace that mindset himself, picking up ice hockey at 44 years old and surfing at 60. “My goal is that at any given surfing break, I will be the best surfer of the worst surfers,” he says.   Get to grace  Growth and grit are key, but Kawasaki believes the third, essential aspect of an impactful career is grace: “If you truly want to be remarkable, you need to make the transition to grace. And in grace, you realize you need to pay back to society.” This means adjusting how you “keep score,” he says — looking past your paycheck or what kind of car is in your driveway to your impact on the world. For Kawasaki, his impact — he hopes — will be inspiring people to be remarkable.   “When I die,” he says, “I want people to say, ‘Guy Kawasaki empowered me to make a difference.’”",
