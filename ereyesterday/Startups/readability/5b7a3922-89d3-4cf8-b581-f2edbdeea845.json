Power Partner 2024 honoree. “We’re going to give them the full toolkit for success, whether that’s business planning, employee management, cash flow management, marketing and resiliency planning or future proofing their business.”Watkins, alongside Mark Cuban, Shark Tank investor and co-founder of Cost Plus Drugs, Tabitha Brown, actress, entrepreneur and Chief Empowerment Officer at Clover, and Justin Fenchel, “Shark Tank” entrepreneur, announced the Clover x Shark Tank Summit, set to take place in Las Vegas from Sept. 28-30, at SXSW Monday. Cuban’s last season on Shark Tank is currently airing on ABC. He said the summit provided a chance for him to extend his involvement.“I was really impressed with Clover and what they can do for small businesses, particularly people who typically don’t have all the opportunities that might be available to others,” Cuban says. “Some of the greatest opportunities often occur with the people who have been disrespected the most, and when you find those people, they’re willing to work the hardest.”The event will allow entrepreneurs the chance to pitch to the “Sharks,” network with other business leaders, hear from industry experts and learn how to help grow their businesses. The program is designed to help combat the small business failure rate—about half of small businesses do not make it past five years, according to 2024 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Clover currently serves more than 785,000 merchants globally, Watkins says, and she is excited for more small business owners to learn about its technology package and services. “The reason we are in business is to bring the dreams of entrepreneurs to life and be really their support system, the Robin to their Batman, as they bring their dreams to the forefront and share their love of their craft with the world,” Watkins says. Registration opens today on Clover’s website, and small business owners can also apply to participate through the Access Pass grant program, designed for entrepreneurs who may not have the resources to attend. The entry period begins today and ends Aug. 11. Brown, Cuban and others at Shark Tank will judge the entries, Watkins says. Brown and Cuban say they will look for passion, originality and sales when evaluating applications. Brown also announced an upcoming docuseries titled “That’s Your Business,” which will spotlight the challenges small businesses owners face. She says the most impactful part of the experience was being able to serve the community of entrepreneurs. “Everybody just wants to know that somebody is willing to help them,’” Brown says. “Being able to get the message across that you’re not alone in your journey was the thing that has lasted and we continue to last for me.”The extended application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is this Friday, March 14, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
