  "text": "You know the saying—there’s no place like the Sphere. The Las Vegas venue will soon host screenings of The Wizard of Oz, but this isn’t your grandmother’s version of the classic film. In collaboration with Google, Magnopus and Warners Brothers, Sphere has created a remade, AI-enhanced Wizard of Oz, expanded to fill the Sphere’s massive screen. At Google’s Cloud Next event on April 8, held within the Sphere, CEO Sundar Pichai announced the collaboration, and showed off a few clips from the new version of the movie. The original movie was, of course, shot on film, and would only fill a fraction of the Sphere’s screen if presented without changes. The Wizard of Oz won’t be the first movie ever shown at the Sphere, but it will be the first true Hollywood film to screen in the venue. Darren Aronofsky’s Postcard from Earth, a film specifically meant to show off the venue’s capabilities, plays at the Sphere almost every day, but is more of a visual experience than a theatrical narrative. To expand the movie’s aspect ratio so that it would fill the Sphere’s 160,000 square foot LED screen while keeping the image clear, Google used AI to generate entirely new pixels. Google calls this process of using AI to boost an image or video’s resolution as “super resolution.” Google attempted to keep the imagery consistent by training customized versions of its Veo 2 and Imagen 3 AI models on every piece of Wizard of Oz data they could find, from the original film to concept art, and even information regarding the lenses used on the cameras.  Because of the expanded aspect ratio, images that would’ve been off-camera before would now need to be seen, like part of a person’s body. To create these expanded scenes, Google used a method called “outpainting,” in which the AI model uses its knowledge of the movie to create additional imagery beyond what was originally shot. Essentially, this means that almost every frame of the new version of the movie has been at least partially generated by AI. In some cases, this meant generating whole new performances by actors who have been dead for decades. In an example from early on in the movie, Dorthy is talking with Auntie Em and Miss Gulch, but walks past Uncle Henry. We know he’s right offscreen, so an expanded, wider shot naturally would need to include him, but no footage exists. The team working on the project used AI models to create digital recreations of actors, and used data related to their performances to ensure their new actions were in line with how the actors originally played the roles. This isn’t the first time AI has been used to enhance an older movie. Last year, several of James Cameron’s films, such as Aliens and True Lies, were released on 4K disc with AI-powered enhancements. Not everyone was pleased with the results, but the images were undeniably crisp. The Wizard of Oz at Sphere will premiere on August 28.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
