  "text": "Run Games revealed its new game, Football Heroes League, at Gamescom Latam this week as part of the Future Games Show. The title is a tactical multiplayer soccer game. After revealing the game, Run Games surprise-launched Football Heroes League into early access on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. Version 1.0 will also launch on mobile and console. Football Heroes League is a follow-up on Run’s previous mobile game, Football Heroes Online. It’s a multiplayer title with onlin 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 and ranked matches. Players can choose from several characters, each with their own superpowers and abilities. These can include not only fancy kicks and midfield defense, but also robots to defend goals. The game also features tactical gameplay, with easy-to-use controls that mimic the real sport. The early access launch includes five heroes, with more to come as the early access period continues. The game is free-to-play, with a paid All Character Bundle featuring skins, emotes and recolors. Michael Marzola, Run Games’ creative director, said in a statement, “I’ve played soccer my whole life, and many of us here at Run Games play it competitively, and we wanted to find a way to fuse the rush of being on the pitch, and the tactics of soccer, with the fantastical action and approachability of arcade sports games. We want Football Heroes League to give you an appreciation for the depth of soccer, but with all the wild action you expect from video games.” GB Daily Stay in the know!
