Photo: Getty ImagesListen to this ArticleMore info0:00 / 0:00Amazon Web Services is reportedly gearing up to launch a new online marketplace for AI agents, with Anthropic as a marquee vendor. According to TechCrunch, AWS will announce this AI agent marketplace at its AWS Summit event in New York City on July 15. The marketplace will enable startups to sell AI agents directly on the platform, and for businesses to demo and deploy agents directly to their AWS-powered software. “We look forward to sharing our latest innovations with customers at AWS Summit New York next week,” an AWS spokesperson told Inc. AI agents are essentially the next evolution of AI chatbots like ChatGPT. Instead of just serving as a source of knowledge, AI agents are able to take actions and digitally effect change, like using a web browser to search for a specific product, running code, sending emails, scheduling meetings, and connecting to proprietary data sources. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic see AI agents as the future of the industry because of their ability to both automate business processes and better serve consumers as a fully functioning AI assistant. However, developing and deploying an AI agent within a piece of software can be a highly technical process. The AWS marketplace could make it easier for companies to integrate AI agents into their behind-the-scenes workflows and consumer-facing products. TechCrunch reports that startups will be able to charge customers for agents in a similar way to cloud-based software shops like Microsoft’s Azure Marketplace, which allow businesses to sell individual software solutions, “rather than bundling them into broader services” like Salesforce. For Anthropic, the marketplace move could make a lot of sense. This month, The Information reported that Anthropic had reached a monthly revenue of $333 million per month, or $4 billion annually. Unlike OpenAI, which makes most of its revenue through individual subscriptions to its ChatGPT platform, Anthropic makes the majority of its money through its API, which enables software developers to integrate the company’s Claude AI into their creations. As Anthropic continues pursuing a primarily B2B strategy, the company needs to make its solutions easily accessible for business customers. Amazon is also one of Anthropic’s largest backers, having invested $8 billion in the company.  The final deadline for the 2025 Inc.
