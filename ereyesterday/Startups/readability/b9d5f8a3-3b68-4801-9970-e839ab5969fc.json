  "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, but they’re limited by fixed context windows and outdated knowledge. What if your AI could access live search, structured data extraction, OCR, and more—all through a standardized interface?We built the JigsawStack MCP Server, an open-source implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that lets any AI model call external tools effortlessly.Here’s what it unlocks:- Web Search \u0026 Scraping: Fetch live information and extract structured data from web pages.- OCR \u0026 Structured Data Extraction: Process images, receipts, invoices, and handwritten text with high accuracy.- AI Translation: Translate text and documents while maintaining context. Image Generation: Generate images from text prompts in real-time.Instead of stuffing prompts with static data or building custom integrations, AI models can now query MCP servers on demand—extending memory, reducing token costs, and improving efficiency.Read the full breakdown here: https://jigsawstack.com/blog/jigsawstack-mcp-serversIf you’re working on AI-powered applications, try it out and let us know how it works for you.
