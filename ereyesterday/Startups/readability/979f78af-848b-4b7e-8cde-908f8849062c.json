  "text": "During Super Bowl LIX, while the Chiefs and Eagles go head-to-head on the field and Kendrick Lamar takes the stage at halftime, another competition will unfold on-screen—one for the most memorable, talked-about commercials. Beyond celebrity cameos and big-budget productions, what can small businesses learn from these high-stakes, high-cost ads? The key isn’t just spectacle—it’s engagement and endearment. Award-winning advertising professionals know that if you don’t capture attention and connect with your audience meaningfully, even the flashiest ad falls flat. Every Super Bowl, brands pull out all the stops, tapping into nostalgia, humor, and star power to capture audience’s attention. Case in point: Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan reuniting in Hellmann’s Super Bowl spot with a clever nod to When Harry Met Sally. Nostalgia doesn’t have to be expensive. If you’ve been waiting to follow Billy Crystal on Instagram, now’s your chance. Just don’t expect much beyond two posts tied to his and Meg Ryan’s Super Bowl spot, “When Sally Met Hellmann’s,” at @itsbillycrystal. When you see Ryan, alongside Crystal, fall head over heels for Hellmann’s mayo, you might find yourself thinking, “I’ll have what she’s having.” Nostalgia, when timed right, is powerful—especially when it taps into iconic moments that resonate with the audience’s memories and emotions. This ad garnered widespread media coverage, including Good Morning America, The Washington Post, the New York Times, and nearly every major network. Hellmann’s campaign extended beyond the ad itself, featuring collaborations with food creators demonstrating Game Day recipes using the brand. Fox has reportedly secured more than $8 million for some 30-second spots, setting a new Super Bowl record. According to Kantar, an international market research company, this staggering cost is justified by the immense impact of Super Bowl advertising. Research shows that Super Bowl ads are 25 times more effective than standard TV commercials in shaping brand perceptions, making them a powerful investment for advertisers seeking to maximize their influence. What makes Hellmann’s particularly effective—and applicable to businesses of any size—is its tiered approach: teaser content on Instagram, the main ad, product placement in the iconic Katz’s Deli sandwich Sally enjoys, Game Day recipes on its website, and partnerships with food creators like Ashley Breann (@imashleybreannn). With this strategy, the campaign has strong long-term potential, keeping momentum well beyond the Super Bowl. Tap into emotion, especially humor. During the Super Bowl, Anheuser-Busch, America’s leading brewer, seeks to sustain its beer category’s momentum through two key brands: Michelob ULTRA and Bud Light. Two Super Bowls ago, Bud Light’s partnership with a transgender influencer sparked a cultural firestorm, drawing backlash from some of the beer’s fans as well as from conservative commentators. Its comeback strategy now hinges on aligning with popular subjects—NFL, cookouts, colonoscopies (well, not that popular), leaf blowers, and country music—while bringing humor back to the brand. Shane Gillis brings major dad energy as he lounges in a driveway with Post Malone in Bud Light’s spot, “Big Men on Cul-de-Sac: Easy to Drink, Easy to Enjoy,” where they come close—but not quite—to enjoying a beer. A recent survey by market research firm Numerator found that nearly half of Super Bowl viewers are eager to see what Budweiser will bring this year, with 44 percent of respondents excited for Budweiser or Bud Light commercials—far more than any other brand. For a brand to be truly memorable, its humor must be seamlessly woven into its story, making it an integral part of the message. Furthermore, it should ideally be original to the brand and authentically reflect its identity. Viewers consider the most memorable Super Bowl commercials to be those that made them laugh. The survey also found that consumers rated the best ads as those featuring humor (71 percent), nostalgic references (38 percent), celebrity appearances (32 percent), and emotional connections (25 percent). As Dan Wieden, co-founder of award-winning ad agency Wieden+Kennedy, said, “It’s been the same since people gathered around the campfire to hear a story. Are you a good storyteller or a bad storyteller? Make me laugh, make me cry, make me do something. Whether you do it on the Internet or on a balloon floating above me, I don’t care. Just move me, dude.” Emotional advertising elevates the brand beyond mere transactions, resonating in an emotional realm that transcends the product’s or service’s basic utility. The more staying power the better. For more laughs, Dunkin’ Donuts returns with DunKings, a fictional boy band led by actor Ben Affleck. This time, fresh off his Broadway success and starring role in HBO’s Succession, fellow Bostonian Jeremy Strong joins Affleck and his brother, Casey, for “The Bean Method.” In the spot, which Dunkin’ teased during the Grammys, Strong takes method acting to the extreme, fully submerged in a bin of coffee beans, where he says, “I’m just trying to find the character.” Michelob Ultra’s “The ULTRA Hustle,“ featuring Catherine O’Hara and Willem Dafoe as pickleball hustlers, has already become a fan favorite, generating buzz even before it airs during Super Bowl LIX. As an advertising creative, I can’t help but think that many of my colleagues are shaking their heads, thinking, “I wish I had come up with that.” It’s not just because it’s strong enough to be the premise of a film or TV comedy, but because it has staying power—it’s the kind of content that could evolve into binge-worthy material for the brand. That’s where small businesses should take notice. Binge-worthy content keeps people coming back and spending time with your brand—priceless. GoDaddy’s Super Bowl spot cleverly blends celebrity endorsement with a real-life entrepreneurial story to highlight its AI-powered business tool, Airo. The ad features actor Walton Goggins (Fallout, The Righteous Gemstones, The White Lotus, Justified), who not only plays a role in the commercial but also promotes his actual eyewear brand. Titled “Act Like You Know,” the spot humorously draws a connection between acting and entrepreneurship. Goggins begins by joking that actors often have no clue what they’re doing, much like new business owners. He then explains how GoDaddy Airo helped him build his eyewear brand by generating essential business elements such as a logo, website, and social media content. This approach makes the ad more relatable and engaging by showcasing how artificial intelligence can simplify starting a business while leveraging Goggins’ personality and real-life venture for authenticity. Don’t be a downer. We know humor works, but what doesn’t is being a Debbie Downer and killing the game-day vibe. (A quick shout out to SNL’s 50th anniversary—Debbie Downer, the fictional character created and portrayed by Rachel Dratch.) Viewers gravitate toward positive vibes but are less receptive to solemn messaging. People want an escape. Many socialize during the game, both in person and online. A new Ad Age-Harris Poll survey found that 69 percent of respondents prefer funny ads, while only 14 percent favor serious ones. This tracks, as the Super Bowl remains one of the rare televised events that unites a vast, diverse audience in a lively and uplifting way. And don’t forget about Monday morning. Coors Light’s Super Bowl campaign isn’t just a one-time ad—it’s a multi-week marketing effort that cleverly tapped into a universal experience: the struggle of getting through Mondays, especially the Monday after the Super Bowl, often called the least productive day of the year. The campaign kicked off three weeks before the big game with a seemingly simple billboard in Times Square. The outdoor board read “Mountain Cold Refershment”—with a noticeable typo. The internet quickly latched onto the mistake, debating whether it was a bit of marketing mischief or just an embarrassing oversight. Coors Light played along, thanking fans for pointing out the mistake, posting, “Coors Light wants to thank everyone for letting us know about the errors. Very chill of you. Mondays, am I right?” As engagement grew, Coors Light doubled down by launching “Case of the Mondays,” a limited-edition six-pack designed specifically for the Monday after the Super Bowl. The brand cited research showing that Super Bowl Monday is one of the hardest workdays of the year, reinforcing the idea that people might need a little extra refreshment to get through it. From there, the campaign unfolded in weekly Monday activations leading up to the Super Bowl. The following week, Coors Light introduced a branded face roller, marketed as the perfect way to “chill” after a rough Monday. The week after that, they dropped a comedic ad featuring actor Timothy Simons struggling to get through his lines, humorously embodying a “Case of the Mondays” in action. Finally, on Super Bowl Monday, Coors Light released its full game-day ad—featuring sloths. The spot leaned into the idea that the Monday after the Super Bowl is the slowest-moving day of the year, with sloths symbolizing how sluggish everyone feels trying to get back into the swing of things. What makes this campaign so effective? First, it wasn’t just about a single ad—it built momentum over time, keeping people engaged for weeks. Second, it tapped into a widely shared cultural insight: the struggle of post-Super Bowl burnout. Third, it leveraged humor and relatability, with each activation reinforcing the central theme in a fun and engaging way. By turning a simple insight into a sustained, multi-touchpoint campaign, Coors Light didn’t just drop a Super Bowl ad—it owned Super Bowl Monday. Super Bowl commercials often serve as a barometer not only for the economy but also for shifting cultural micro-trends, reflecting the nation’s mood and interests. For example, the limited number of car ads can signal the financial health of the automotive industry, while Anheuser-Busch’s emphasis on Michelob Ultra highlights the growing consumer demand for healthier, lower-calorie options. Ads that tap into nostalgia have proven effective in forging emotional connections, and this year’s commercials continue to emphasize humor, storytelling, and relatable themes. For small businesses aiming to make their mark, these trends offer valuable insights. Whether you’re crafting your own content or studying the strategies of larger brands, it’s essential to keep your audience at the heart of your messaging. After all, it’s about making a lasting impression and ensuring your brand stays top of mind.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
