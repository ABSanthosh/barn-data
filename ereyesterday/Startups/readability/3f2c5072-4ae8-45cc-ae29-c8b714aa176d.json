To boot, plastic production is resource-intensive, using up around six per cent of the global oil supply and accounting for five per cent of global CO2 emissions. Enter MacroCycle and its proprietary SolvoGenesis process, an innovative chemical recycling method that transforms lower-value plastic waste into virgin-grade PET (mPET) resin. Unlike traditional processes that break down plastics completely, MacroCycle’s approach uses cyclic macromolecule synthesis to upcycle waste at an 80 per cent lower energy cost. When powered by renewable energy, this process enables plastics manufacturing with zero carbon emissions, bypassing petrochemical inputs entirely. What makes MacroCycle’s innovation stand out is its cyclical approach to recycling and upcycling. By eliminating the need for new fossil-fuel-derived materials, the process reduces Scope 3 emissions and prevents ocean-bound plastics from entering ecosystems. Additionally, the ability to achieve virgin-grade quality material ensures that recycled plastics meet stringent regulatory and performance standards, making this solution practical for industries aiming to achieve sustainability goals. As Co-founder and CEO Stwart Peña Feliz explains, the process provides a “pathway for electrification and full decarbonisation of plastics manufacturing.” Currently, MacroCycle is scaling production to deliver its mPET resin to customers and eventually aims to reach thousands of tonnes per year. The company is also seeking partnerships to accelerate mass adoption and enable the company to have a global impact. Feliz hopes that MacroCycle will become the “de facto method” for producing PET plastics, helping to decouple the industry from carbon-intensive production forever.
