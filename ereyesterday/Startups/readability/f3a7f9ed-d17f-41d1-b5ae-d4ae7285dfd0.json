Photo: Getty ImagesListen to this ArticleMore info0:00 / 0:00Starbucks’ new dress code is cramping employees’ style. Hundreds of employees at 50 of the Seattle coffee chain’s stores walked out on the job on Wednesday after the company announced employees are required to wear black shirts. During the walkouts, the employees’ union filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board alleging the dress code changes are illegal, Bloomberg reported. The new dress code went into effect on Monday; it requires employees to wear solid long or short sleeve shirts with either khaki, black, or denim pants. Employees also have the option to wear company branded shirts; Starbucks said it will provide each employee with two they can wear to shifts. Previously, employees could wear any color during a shift. But after five quarters of declining sales, Starbucks is hoping that polishing its branding—by having its “iconic green apron shine”—will help drive sales, the company says in a release. However, the union feels that the new dress code “materially differed from both the status quo and what the parties had tentatively agreed to at the bargaining table, thus undermining the Union’s representational status,” the unfair labor practice charge reads. Starbucks tells Bloomberg that the strike has not affected service at its coffeehouses. But the union warns that more strikes are likely in the near future. That warning tracks with a recent report on workplace trends from Red Thread Research, a consulting firm, which forecasts a rise in work stoppages this year, “driven by frustrations over wages, working conditions, and organizational priorities.” The report’s summary noted “the pendulum of power between senior leaders and employees continues to swing, creating a climate where fostering collaboration and addressing systemic issues can be an uphill battle.” If the Starbucks dispute winds up at the negotiating table, at least there’ll be plenty of coffee to fuel the contentious discussion.
