In 2025, the job market is going to look even more different than what leaders are used to, with new trends and changing expectations reshaping what makes someone a great hire. It’s not enough for candidates to simply meet the job’s technical requirements. Companies today need people who can thrive in fast-paced, ever-changing environments and bring more than just hard skills to the table. Recruiters have to start looking at the human qualities that really help someone succeed and contribute to a strong, people-focused culture.That means leaders need to approach interviews differently. It’s no longer just about verifying qualifications or asking the same old questions. It’s about digging deeper to understand the traits that will make someone a great long-term fit. Emotional intelligence, creativity, and adaptability are just a few of the key qualities that can set a candidate apart. What should leaders and recruiters be on the lookout for? Here are 10 green flags to help you spot candidates who won’t just be good hires. They’ll be great ones.1. Emotional intelligence matters more than everLeaders have all seen how crucial emotional intelligence is in today’s fast-paced, people-centric workplaces. When a candidate responds thoughtfully to constructive feedback during an interview, it’s a major green flag. It shows they have the self-awareness and adaptability that are essential for navigating team dynamics and handling challenges.These are the types of people who can manage stress, understand their own emotions, and respond effectively to others, making them key players in any team.2. The ability to ask insightful questionsA candidate’s questions can reveal just as much about them as their answers. If they’re asking about things like team dynamics, long-term goals, or the company’s values, it shows they’re not just here for the paycheck. They want to understand the bigger picture. When someone digs deep and shows genuine curiosity, it’s a strong indicator that they’re looking for a role that aligns with their personal and professional growth. These candidates often end up being great long-term fits.3. Excitement about continuous learningI always get excited when a candidate talks about ongoing experience, whether it’s through side projects, certifications, or even personal interests they’ve pursued on their own. In today’s rapidly changing industries, you need people who are curious and willing to learn new things. This willingness to keep growing shows they’re driven by more than necessity. They have a passion for improvement. In a world where new tools and technologies can emerge overnight, continuous learners are always an asset.4. Transparency and self-awarenessOf course, no one is perfect. However, candidates who are upfront about their weaknesses and can articulate the steps they’ve taken to improve them show a level of self-awareness that’s invaluable in the workplace. This kind of transparency is a green flag because it demonstrates humility and a willingness to evolve. When someone knows where they need to grow and aren’t afraid to admit it, they’re far more likely to succeed in a role.5. Innovation and creativityIndustries are shifting faster than ever, and staying competitive means thinking outside the box. A green flag to watch for is when a candidate demonstrates creative problem-solving or the ability to innovate. Whether they’ve developed a new process, adapted to a major change, or found a unique solution to a challenge, these are the candidates who will help your company stay ahead of the curve. Creativity is no longer just a “nice to have.” It’s essential for survival.6. They show resilience and gritIn unpredictable times, resilience has become a key trait for success. When candidates talk about overcoming challenges or how they bounced back from failures, it’s a strong indicator that they can handle whatever comes their way.Resilience and grit aren’t just buzzwords. They’re crucial qualities for anyone who’s going to be in it for the long haul. If someone can keep pushing forward despite setbacks, that’s someone you want on your team.7. They believe in your missionAll leaders know how important it is for new hires to fit into the company culture. A major green flag here is when a candidate has clearly done their research and can speak to your company’s values, mission, or vision. This shows they’re not just interested in the role. They’re interested in becoming part of something bigger. When a candidate takes the time to understand your organization’s culture and goals, it’s a clear sign they’re in it for the right reasons.8. CollaborationTeamwork is the backbone of today’s workplaces. In interviews, candidates who can demonstrate their ability to work well with diverse groups, share ideas, and contribute to a common goal are displaying a key green flag. Collaboration isn’t just about getting along with others. It’s about actively engaging in group problem-solving, being open to different perspectives, and helping to create an inclusive and productive team environment. Candidates who speak to past experiences working in cross-functional teams or successfully navigating team dynamics will likely be strong contributors to a cohesive, innovative work culture.9. Autonomy and accountabilityIn fast-paced, dynamic environments, the ability to work independently while staying accountable is more important than ever. Self-starters who can take ownership of their tasks, manage their time effectively, and deliver results without constant supervision are invaluable. During the interview, if a candidate talks about how they’ve led projects or managed their workload autonomously, it signals that they’ll thrive in environments that demand flexibility. Candidates who can balance autonomy with accountability—taking responsibility for both successes and mistakes—are the ones who can be trusted to deliver consistently, no matter the circumstances.10. A passion for the role and industryFinally, passion is one of the biggest green flags I look for. When a candidate is genuinely excited about the role, the company, or the industry as a whole, it shows in how they speak. That enthusiasm is contagious and can have a ripple effect across the team. Passionate employees are often more engaged, more motivated, and more likely to stick around for the long term. When someone’s heart is in it, they’re going to do their best work—and that’s a win for everyone.In your next round of interviews, try asking open-ended questions that explore a candidate’s growth mindset or observe how they handle constructive feedback—these subtle cues can reveal whether they’re the right fit for your team’s long-term success. As business owners and leaders move into 2025, emotional intelligence, adaptability, and a passion for growth are non-negotiables in hiring. By staying attuned to these green flags, you’ll build a team that’s not just capable of doing the job, but one that can drive lasting success for your organization.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
