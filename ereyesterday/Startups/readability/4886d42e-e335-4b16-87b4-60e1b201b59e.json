  "text": "In January President Trump signed an executive order that tried to clamp down on what he calls “illegal” policies on diversity, equity, and inclusion in the corporate world. The order steered federal agencies to “combat” private companies’ use of “DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities,” according to legal industry news site JDSupra. But while the words from the White House included some aggressive language, the order was light on detail, specifically what actually constitutes “illegal” DEI under that order. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, EEOC, and the Department of Justice have now stepped up to fill this information void, issuing guidance to private sector employers about policies they may previously have embraced that they should now avoid. It could be important if your company wants to stay off Trump and Elon Musk’s anti-DEI radar.One of the key documents, JDSupra notes, is from the EEOC and it’s called “What To Do If You Experience Discrimination Related to DEI at Work.” Once you’ve got past the puzzling syntax of the title, there’s useful data in the text, though there’s no specific definition of what constitutes DEI. Instead, it includes guidelines for what habits might violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964—i.e. discrimination—under the new Trump administration. This includes using “quotas” or similar “balancing” tactics to diversify your workforce on the grounds of race, sex, or other “protected” characteristics. Your company also cannot use protected characteristics to make decisions for firing, hiring, promotion or other typical business practices like deciding on pay. Among a list of other prohibited tactics, the document makes it clear that if you retaliate against a worker who states a “fact specific” complaint that your company is violating Title VII via a DEI policy, that’s a very bad thing.The second important new document is called “What You Should Know About DEI-Related Discrimination at Work,” and it’s more of a “frequently asked questions” piece. Several of its statements are likely to spawn controversy.Those include defining the position of the EEOC to say there are no separate standards for “reverse discrimination,” meaning there’s no difference between discrimination experienced by an employee belonging to a majority group versus one belonging to a minority one. Additionally, there is only now a need for a worker to demonstrate “some injury” or “some harm” to trigger a discrimination claim, versus the former, more strict, need to show “significant” harm.Whether this will cause an avalanche of discrimination lawsuits from aggrieved workers with discrimination complaints remains to be seen.Nevertheless, the EEOC and DOJ documentation may be an important resource for businesses large and small, arriving amid a barrage of reports that corporate America isn’t completely abandoning DEI. Rather, some companies are “rebranding” their DEI policies, bending toward the new norm versus embracing it, and news that smaller businesses in particular are sticking by their guns.Steering between the new policy rules, the new EEOC and DOJ guidance (which JDSupra points out isn’t binding in court), and long-held corporate principles of equality and inclusiveness is likely to be tricky. As at least one critic has pointed out, it may, or may not, be okay to merely change the language of existing corporate-level DEI rules.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
