  "text": "During their latest quarterly meetings with investors, thousands of business leaders talked primarily about three topics: tariffs, uncertainty, and agentic artificial intelligence.  That’s according to a 69-page report on the trends that emerged in Q1/2025 earnings calls based on “data from more than 8,000 corporate earnings calls of U.S.-listed companies from Q1 2025 and Q4 2024,” according to IOT Analytics. For example, 43 percent of those earnings calls mentioned the word tariff—a 190 percent leap from the previous quarter. Uncertainty—over the economic outlook, interest rates, military alliances, and tariffs—occurred in 38 percent of the earnings calls—up 49 percent from the previous quarter, reported IOT Analytics. Read on for what CEOs are saying about these topics. Tariffs CEOs say they are passing along their higher costs—driven up by tariffs—to customers in the form of higher prices and are rejiggering their supply chains to minimize how much tariffs raise their cost. “Whatever tariff we cannot mitigate, we view that as an input cost. And as our input costs go up, it may require us to adjust prices,” Dell Technologies COO Jeff Clarke said in a February 28, 2025, investor call, noted IOT Analytics. Rockwell, meanwhile, plans to shift the company’s supply chain to minimize the impact of tariffs. We “have some products that are produced in Mexico and destined for the U.S., but similar production that occurs in the U.S. where the destination is outside the United States,” Rockwell CFO Christian Rothe said in a February 10, 2025, conference call.  “We are swapping those out, moving the production for non-U.S. customers outside the U.S. in order to create capacity to manufacture production for U.S. customers inside the U.S. It’s a small portion of our overall tariff-impacted operations, but a good example of quick moves we can make,” he added. Tariffs are distracting CEOs from their growth initiatives. For example, GE Vernova expects costs to rise $300 million to $400 million more because of tariffs—though CEO Scott Strazik and CFO Kenneth Parks said they would try to minimize how much of those costs they passed on to customers, reported The Boston Globe. Lab equipment supplier Thermo Fisher Scientific warned of a “$400 million headwind” in 2025 from the China tariff, “because of the effects on China-sourced parts and China’s retaliatory tariffs on products that Thermo Fisher makes in America and ships to that country,” the Globe reported. Medical technology supplier Boston Scientific is cutting back on meetings and travel to offset $200 million in additional costs caused by tariffs, the company’s CFO, Daniel Brennan, said, according to the Globe.  Meanwhile, game maker Hasbro—which makes hundreds of items in China—expects a drop in demand akin to the 2008-2009 recession prompting the company to accelerate a $1 billion cost-cutting plan, CEO Chris Cocks told investors, the Globe wrote. Citi analyst James Hardiman asked Cocks, “How do you even make decisions in this current environment?” Hasbro is operating under the assumption the United States will get to a “reasonable and logical trade policy ultimately, once all the negotiations are done,” Cocks responded. Uncertainty Meanwhile, all the different kinds of uncertainty is making business leaders more cautious. “And maybe there are some pockets in some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they’re executing in the near term,” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in a January 15, 2024, investor call, noted IOT Analytics. This caution extends globally for some companies. “We are in 182 countries, so what we are seeing is some reticence for certain cross-border transactions,” Boost Payment Solutions CEO Dean Leavitt told Pymnts. “Especially when it’s U.S. companies paying suppliers around the world, we’ve definitely seen a bit of a ‘wait-and-see’ approach just to see what’s going to shake out with the tariffs.” Agentic AI Last year, in my latest book, Brain Rush, I predicted agentic AI would be a wave of the future if it could operate without errors. Agentic AI—systems aiming to act autonomously in making decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals—accounted for 2.2 percent of earnings calls mentioned in the first quarter. While that is small, it represented 275 percent growth over the previous quarter, according to IOT Analytics. CEOs view agentic AI as a possible way to increase productivity, which in theory could help offset some of the cost increases resulting from tariffs. “As we free up our customers from manual low-value tasks, we plan to bring additional advisory capabilities, starting with tax planning later this year through our agentic AI assistant that allows our customers to provide incremental value to their clients while generating additional revenue for their practices,” Thomson Reuters Corporation CEO Steve Hasker said in a February 6, 2025, investor call. Nvidia—which will benefit from the adoption of agentic AI—sees the technology as the wave of the future. “That whole part of using agentic AI to revolutionize the way we work inside companies, that’s just starting,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a February 25, 2025, investor call. Action Items Employees are at risk of losing their jobs unless they become part of the solution for helping companies lower their costs and find new growth opportunities in the wake of rising tariffs and uncertainty that may slash the wages companies place on new growth curves.  If you can learn how to use generative and agentic AI to boost your productivity, you may be one of the survivors.
