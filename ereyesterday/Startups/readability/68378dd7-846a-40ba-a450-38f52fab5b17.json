  "text": "It’s OK to say “Merry Christmas” at work. It’s OK to put up a Christmas tree. It’s OK to have a secret Santa, a Christmas sugar cookie decorating day, a gingerbread house building contest, or an ugly Christmas sweater day. It’s probably not OK to do each and every one of these things unless everyone in your office celebrates Christmas. Approximately 85 percent of Americans celebrate Christmas in one way or another. And there are many people who don’t personally celebrate Christmas who are perfectly fine with these types of Christmas activities. But, there’s also a really good chance there are people in your office who do not celebrate Christmas. They are probably fine with you celebrating, but when you have Christmas after Christmas after Christmas activity, they can start to feel left out, ignored, and excluded. As one of my Jewish friends told me, “Hanukkah isn’t a Jewish equivalence of Xmas, and asking to conform to Xmas traditions is the opposition of what the story of Hanukkah is about.” Know your employees If you have a small business, it’s probably pretty easy to know which holidays people celebrate. You don’t have to pry, but you should pay attention. If your business is larger, assume that people celebrate different holidays. One way to better understand your employee base is to ask which holidays they celebrate as part of your employee engagement surveys. You may well find out about holidays you didn’t know existed. And you’ll likely find multiple holidays that people celebrate throughout the year. Employees who do not celebrate Christmas are far more likely to enjoy celebrations that include a Christmas tree if you’ve previously celebrated holidays that are important to them. This could be Lunar New Year, Eid al-Fitr, Rosh Hashanah, Diwali, Vesak, or any other holiday your employees wish to celebrate. How to celebrate holidays at work The most important rule is that all holiday celebrations should be 100 percent voluntary, with zero repercussions for non-attendance. Remember, some people don’t celebrate any holidays, including birthdays! Forcing someone to participate in a holiday may well be religious discrimination. Also, no single holiday should be overwhelming. Whether you’re having 25 days of Christmas activities of 30 days of Ramadan, it’s going to be overwhelming and off-putting to people who don’t celebrate. (And, honestly, probably to people who do celebrate! Remember, your primary focus at work should be work.) Lastly, your company should either sponsor all major holidays that employees celebrate or none. A big December party should be a holiday party and not a Christmas party unless you are sure that every member of your staff celebrates. And since December tends to be a busy time, having a New Year’s party in January may just be better for everyone. One more thought — while it’s OK to say Merry Christmas at work, it’s definitely not OK to insist that others say it back to you. You can’t force someone to participate in your holiday. And if someone wishes you a “happy [holiday-that-you don’t-celebrate],” the proper response is, “Thank you!” or “And a happy [insert appropriate holiday] to you, too!”The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
