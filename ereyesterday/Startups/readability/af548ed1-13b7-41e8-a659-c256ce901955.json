  "text": "A young disruptor has swerved into the ride-hailing industry–and it’s challenging both regulators and the ride-hailing establishment. Founded in 2019, ride-hailing startup Empower launched operations in Washington D.C. in 2020 and now accounts for about 10 percent of the local market. Empower boasts lower fares for riders and higher pay for drivers, but regulators say the company is operating illegally. It has not registered with the city’s Department of For-Hire Vehicles (DFHV), and has racked up some $100 million in fines, a lawsuit, and an investigation over its lack of registration.Empower has drawn the ire of regulators and lawmakers including District of Columbia Councilmember Brianne Nadeau, who called the company out for “gaslighting,” among other criticisms. “The lack of self-awareness that they are fundamentally the same as Uber was when it came in is astounding to me,” she told The New York Times.Empower, which is run by founder and CEO Joshua Sear, considers its drivers neither employees nor independent contractors. And unlike Uber or Lyft, Empower charges drivers a flat monthly fee of $350 instead of taking commission from rides.“With Empower, you are a customer, not our employee or independent contractor, so you do not receive a W-2 or 1099 from Empower,” an FAQ on Empower’s website reads. “You are your own boss. You set your own rates and get 100% of the fare.”It’s this perspective–and that drivers take home about 30 percent more and riders pay about 20 percent less than competitors, according to The New York Times, that has prompted Sear to frame Empower’s fight as a civil rights battle and officials as defending the interests of Uber lobbyists. Regulators, however, see it as a tactic for Empower to avoid registering with D.C.’s DFHV, which The Washington Post notes was born out of an agreement with D.C. Council, the central and chief policy-making body for the District of Columbia, when Uber and Lyft were acting out against taxi regulations. DFHV registration requires paying fees and ensuring drivers have commercial insurance, or providing it for them. Empower has racked up substantial fines for ignoring the department’s calls for it to stop operating until it registers.Although some riders have reported unsafe driving, theft and inappropriate behavior from Empower drivers, a D.C. Court of Appeals determined that the company did not pose a risk to public safety when it overturned a 2020 cease and desist order, filed by DFHV. It did, however, rule that the company should register with the Department of For-Hire Vehicles. A D.C. Superior Court judge issued another cease and desist in November, The Post reported.Sear, who plans to expand into new markets (and already started with Baltimore in November), is attempting to force regulators’ hands. He proposed a bill that would require drivers, rather than the ride hailing companies, to register with the city. So far, it hasn’t gained traction.“That we should change our law to accommodate them is incredibly ridiculous,” Nadeau told The Times, warning of possible criminal penalties to come.Uber did not respond to Inc.’s requests for comment. Empower did not provide a statement in time for publication.",
