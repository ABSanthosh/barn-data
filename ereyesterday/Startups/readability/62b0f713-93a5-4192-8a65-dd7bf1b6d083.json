  "text": "David Nilssen, an Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO) member in Seattle, is the CEO of Doxa Talent, which helps businesses build and scale high-performing, borderless teams leveraging talent from across the world. He has more than 800 team members and zero office space. He is also the co-founder of Guidant Financial, which has helped 30,000 entrepreneurs secure $7 billion to start or buy a business in each of the 50 U.S. states. Nilssen shared his strategy for keeping remote teams connected and engaged.Every time I talk to business leaders about remote work, the conversation immediately jumps to tools—which video platform, what project management software, and which chat app. As someone who runs a company with more than 800 team members across five countries—the Philippines, Vietnam, Colombia, Kenya, and the United States—what actually works is connection.  Here’s what we’ve discovered: You can invest in every premium remote-work tool on the market and still struggle to build an effective team. The reason is because you’re missing the human element that turns a group of distributed workers into a high-performing team. We’ve found that when you prioritize connection over tools, everything else falls into place, including how effectively those tools are actually used.  Here’s how we make it work:  Look beyond the technology stack Most companies start their remote journey by building an impressive suite of digital tools, but my team has taken a different path. Every meeting starts not with screen sharing or status updates, but with a simple question that has nothing to do with work. It might be about childhood memories or future dreams—something that makes people pause, think, and share.  These moments create the foundation for everything else. When team members share personal stories, they’re not just making small talk. They’re building the trust that makes all our fancy collaboration tools work.  The human operating system  Tools can bridge time zones, but they can’t bridge cultural gaps. Here’s something my team learned the hard way: Understanding how different cultures approach work and ensuring that every voice is heard matters more than any project management dashboard. Take something as basic as feedback. Some of our team members expect direct communication, while others look for more nuanced approaches. No tool can navigate that for you.  By focusing first on human understanding, we’ve built an environment where tools enhance rather than replace personal connections. It’s not about which task management system you use. It’s about understanding how your people prefer to work together.  Build connections, not just channelsThe business process outsourcing industry is notorious for high turnover. I often hear, “We need better tools to track productivity.” But that misses the point entirely. When we bring together global teams—from Manila to Miami and everywhere in between—we don’t just set up a Slack channel; we create opportunities for real relationships to form.  This philosophy led us to write 2000 Questions to Spark Connection: The Ultimate Guide for Remote Teams. It’s not another digital tool. It’s our way of building the kind of meaningful dialogue that makes digital tools actually useful.  Create moments that matterWe use digital tools for our daily operations, but what actually moves the needle is shared experiences that go beyond the screen. Make every team member feel like they truly belong. We’ve developed simple but powerful activities that get people to talk. Try a quick round of “This or That” at the start of a meeting. Watch how your video call transforms from just another virtual meeting into a space where real connection happens.  Start your meetings this way, and here’s what you’ll see: Teams don’t just participate; they engage. They don’t just communicate; they connect. Yes, those same tools you’ve always used suddenly become more effective because people want to use them.  Measure the intangibleOf course we track all the usual metrics—productivity, retention, and tool adoption rates. But what really matters are the things no software can measure. How connected do our people feel? How freely do they share ideas? How much do they trust their teammates? We’ve found that our retention rates blow past industry standards because we’ve built something tools alone can’t create: true belonging.  When teams feel genuinely connected, even if they’re collaborating across continents and time zones, they don’t just use tools better, they take incredible care of our clients. Those clients see the difference between a team that’s merely well-equipped and one that’s truly well-connected.  The future is humanAs remote work continues to evolve, there will be more tools, platforms, and digital solutions. Success, however, won’t come from having the latest technology. It’ll come from creating inclusive cultures where people feel valued, understood, and connected, regardless of where they work.  Our company is living proof that the future of remote work isn’t about finding the perfect tools. It’s about building the perfect environment for people to use the tools they have. By prioritizing connection, it’s not just changing how work gets done. It shows the most powerful tool in remote work isn’t digital at all. It’s humans. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, July 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
