  "text": "There is a music trivia game my daughter and I play where we guess the artist and song title based on audio clues. It makes zero sense to me that anyone, including my daughter, can’t instantly recognize a John Mellencamp, Prince, or U2 song. How is it that too many icons of my generation haven’t made the leap to also be identifiable by today’s generation?That’s a question that transcends the music category. Many brands that consumers believed would be around forever have faced a generational crisis: they grew up and grew old with one audience without making a connection to the next one. There are outliers—like Louis Vuitton, a luxury brand founded in the 1800s that thrives by intersecting tradition with innovation. So, it was interesting to me to explore how Louis Vuitton’s parent company, LVMH, was starting to apply its unique way of thinking to another centuries-old brand in its portfolio: Moët Hennessy.We had an opportunity to interview Moët Hennessy’s recently appointed North American President and CEO, Chris Gabaldon, about his charge to bridge the generational divide.Chris, what lessons did you learn about Moët Hennessy’s origins that most impacted your next chapter?My journey at Moët Hennessy started with traveling to some significant places in the world of wines and spirits—including the Champagne and Cognac regions in France, and Scotland and Poland. I walked the land, touched the stills, explored cellars and caves. I was in places where icons—like Madame Clicquot—revolutionized the industry. I was in places where history continues to be made by today’s guardians and changemakers.I came to understand that rather than looking at the past and future as opposing ideas, Moët Hennessy considers these to be complimentary concepts. That respecting the past and regarding the future, at the same time, is the best way to remain vital at each moment.Think about it in these terms. In the beginning, in the 1700s, there was Moët \u0026 Chandon, a champagne producer, and Hennessy, a cognac producer. In 1971, the brands merged to protect what they built, and to reach global audiences. In 1987, Moët Hennessy merged with Louis Vuitton. Moët Hennessy and Louis Vuitton were famous brands with centuries-old traditions, and they also shared the ambition to translate their history into something that would remain modern and relevant for the times.Today, Moët Hennessy operates 27 global Maisons—from Dom Pérignon, inspired by a French monk, to SirDavis, inspired by Beyoncé Knowles-Carter’s great-grandfather. The brand remains part of LVMH, and persists as one of the most recognized luxury names in the world.What is the biggest barrier to building a strong Moët Hennessy brand for the next 100 years?Change is inevitable. Culture shifts. Consumers evolve. In the alcohol category, health and wellness are now considered when making brand choices. People are screening for additives, sugar levels, and purity of ingredients. Beyond taste, people are also evaluating aesthetics and texture, sensorial experiences, in their buying decisions. While image still matters, it now matters to people who exist in the era of TikTok and Instagram: a time where stories are instantly visible, shareable and viral.Rapid change is something many brands struggle to adapt to. Given the choice to keep up with change or fall behind, most elect to keep up by mirroring consumers. With little regard for their brand’s past and future, they glom onto the latest trends. At Moët Hennessy, we learned to last you have to look over a longer horizon, achieving cultural relevance while remaining true to yourself or risk being a passing fad.For example, we recently introduced Hennessy X.O La Carafe—featuring the original XO blend encased in a stunning re-imagination of the iconic silhouette. Designed to elevate experiences from day to night, it was introduced in places where contemporary drinkers gather. To the more than 250 years of Hennessy tradition, we added this new brand expression which is a testament to our long-standing craftsmanship and innovative spirit; adapting to change without losing our identity.The Hennessy X.O La Carafe. Photo: Courtesy companyIf keeping up with rapid change and chasing short-term trends is a problem, is there a better solution for achieving brand longevity?Leading change beats keeping up with it. In 2023, Pharrell Williams—a well-known culture maker—was hired by Louis Vuitton as their men’s creative director. It is his responsibility to help shape the future of fashion; creating trends, not following them. One of the beautiful realities of LVMH is we have an ability to experiment across the portfolio. So, we partnered an iconic champagne—Moët \u0026 Chandon—with an iconic artist, Pharrell, to co-create a cultural moment.Roughly 22 million birthdays are celebrated around the world each day. Pharrell was inspired to create something with Moët \u0026 Chandon that elevated the birthday moment—where the bottle and its contents are all part of the ceremony.Pharrell considered the moment of giving, receiving and storytelling afterward. Launched in 2025, there is a colorful range of signed bottles. There are bottles with a keepsake bow. There are rarer versions with a bow made to be worn as a high fashion accessory—a brooch taking 300 hours and 7,310 pearled beads to create. The bottle is beautiful, the liquid is great, the design and aesthetic cues are fantastic. But more importantly, Pharrell’s work added cultural meaning. We created an idea, bigger than an execution, that elevated the birthday moment.Moët Hennessy operates in a competitive industry. How do you stand out to stand the test of time?Technically, we are making some of the world’s finest luxury wines and spirits. But actually, what we’re creating is larger than that: it is culture in a bottle. It includes the liquid. It also involves the stories that went into making it, the people who had a hand in crafting it, the environments that supported it, plus the social context surrounding it.Moët Hennessy has been served at lots of significant tables—by kings and presidents, during wars and pandemics, in moments of triumph and defeat. Moët Hennessy continues to be served at tables and in spaces with influential leaders, entertainers, creators and more. We participate in vibrant communities where new ideas are emerging.For generations, we made it our responsibility to preserve culture and to expand culture by passing it on through our work.Photo: Courtesy companyWhat advice do you have for other leaders working to keep their iconic brands vital?One of the most important lessons you’ll learn when working on iconic brands is that you are a steward. It is your responsibility to take care for the next generation.In the case of Moët Hennessy, this requires reinvesting in those places where our wines and spirits come from, and the people—including craftspeople working in the vineyard, distillers, and blenders—who elevate the portfolio. If we don’t protect the land that provides for us, and preserve the accumulated knowledge and skill required for crafting, success will be fleeting.If you want your iconic brand to last for the next 100 years, or even the next 10, leaders have to look at legacy as a forward-looking concept; as something to be passed on not left behind.The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
