Fine-tuning means revising the models with examples so they perform better with fewer hallucinations.\"You have to show [an AI model] tens of thousands of examples of good behavior, and you have to fine-tune those into the model,\" Suleyman said. \"The good news is that tens of thousands of examples are very accessible to many niche domains or specific verticals.
