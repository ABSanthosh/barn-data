When rooms aren’t properly ventilated, CO2 builds up, which can cause dizziness, headaches, and poor concentration for inhabitants staying in these spaces for long periods. Now, researchers from Binghamton University believe they may have a way to easily boost indoor air quality. Inspired by their work on bacteria-powered biobatteries, Professor Seokheun “Sean” Choi and PhD student Maryam Rezaie developed air-purifying cyanobacterial artificial plants. Relying on biological solar cells, the plants can carry out photosynthesis by using indoor light and their cyanobacteria to convert CO2 and water into oxygen. Interestingly, the selected cyanobacteria also have exoelectrogenic properties, meaning these plants can generate up to 140 microwatts of power as well. This innovative and affordable solution was shown to reduce indoor CO2 levels by up to 90 per cent, a ninefold improvement over natural plants. And unlike living plants, they require minimal care and will last a great deal longer, simultaneously generating sufficient electricity to power various devices. Speaking to Springwise, Dr Choi highlighted that further testing is necessary before the technology could be used at scale. According to Dr Choi, “The oxygen generation capacity and bioelectrical output need further enhancement for these plants to become viable for everyday household use. Additionally, long-term studies on toxicity and sustainability are essential to ensure safe and lasting application.” Written By: Joshua Solomon 26th November 2024 Email: info@binghamton.edu Website: binghamton.edu/contact Contact: binghamton.edu/people/sechoi",
