A new trend report released by the reservation platform predicts that next year Americans will be hungrier for reservations and more adventurous in their dining habits. For some, the report says, Wednesday might even supplant Friday as the most popular day of the week to dine out.Over half of U.S. consumers plan to dine out more frequently in 2025, per the report, and 61 percent want to try new restaurants. Young people are especially zealous—71 percent of Gen Zers and 68 percent of millennials want to eat out more in the new year.These diners will be increasingly interested in unique dining experiences like tasting menus, dinner-and-a show experiences, bottomless brunches, and cooking classes, according to OpenTable. The platform says its bookings for these experiences are up 27 percent since 2023 and that 42 percent of surveyed diners want to book one in next year.The report, which incorporates data from OpenTable reservations spanning from January to September along with an online survey of about 1,500 U.S. diners, also identifies midweek dining as a new trend.Of all days, Wednesday saw the biggest booking boost this year—11 percent more reservations in 2024 than 2023—and OpenTable expects this will continue trending upward in 2025. More than four in 10 midweek diners said they choose to go out on Wednesdays, which could be “due to hybrid or remote working schedules,” per the report. Reservation sizes are also changing: solo dining is up 10 percent year over year, and reservations for parties over six are up 8 percent. Next year, 43 percent of those surveyed said they are planning to have more group meals.Groups might be getting together outside of special occasions more frequently, too. Kevin Boehm, co-CEO and co-founder of Boka Restaurant Group, said in the report’s press release that he’s seeing more “‘just because’ group dining” at his restaurants.“We love this because we know magic happens when people come together over a meal,” he said, “and hope to see this build momentum into 2025.”",
