  "text": "In fintech, every customer interaction counts. When it comes to dealing with people’s savings, credit, and investments, trust is of paramount importance. The quality of your customer service either builds and reinforces crucial trust, or severely undermines it if issues are not resolved satisfactorily. Meeting those customer expectations at scale, while also adhering to strict regulatory requirements, demands the very best technology. Relying on traditional customer service solutions and chatbots can lead to slow, frustrating experiences that will compromise that all-important trust. “Less than three months after launching Fin, it now handles more than 50% of our total support cases” But those limitations are increasingly a thing of the past – next-generation LLM-powered AI agents such as Intercom’s Fin can use your pre-existing knowledge content to automatically resolve more than half of customer queries, on average. That was certainly the experience at direct-to-investor platform Fundrise, which has transformed its customer service with Fin. The team was facing a challenge responding to all cases in a timely manner while leaving space to provide thoughtful answers to complex questions. “The results have been extraordinary and exceeded our expectations by a considerable margin,” according to Luke Ruth, Chief Product Officer at Fundrise. “Less than three months after launching Fin, it now handles more than 50% of our total support cases.” Those results have freed the Fundrise team to focus on those high-value questions relating to issues like their investment strategy or property underwriting. And Fundrise is just one of the thousands of companies using Fin to deliver industry-leading customer service. Here, we dive into the key areas that make Fin the standout AI agent for fintech companies. The AI agent designed for fintech’s unique demands Fin AI Agent delivers instant, accurate support across all your channels, effortlessly resolving not just frequently asked questions, but also handling more complex interactions such as KYC checks and troubleshooting transactions. A significant portion of fintech’s support queries relate to topics such as account management, transactions, and product guidance. Fin AI Agent can deliver value straight away by resolving the bulk of these issues, and freeing up more bandwidth for the human support team to focus on more complex topics. Here are just some of the ways Fin can help: Account management Open a new account: Enable seamless account creation, simplify onboarding workflows, and validate customer details. Update personal information: Quickly and securely make updates to personal information, like addresses or employment updates. Verify identity: Confirm identities and ensure compliance for sensitive requests like PIN resets or account access restoration. Transaction management Card management: Activate cards, update limits, and enable secure PIN updates. Track refunds: Provide real-time updates on refund statuses and deposit timelines. Resolve payment issues: Identify failed transactions and suggest alternative methods. Personalized product support Compare products: Provide customers with relevant information to help customers choose between offerings like debit cards with ATM rebates or rewards-focused credit cards. Clarify complex features: Explain details of complex products like fractional share investing or loan agreements based on your knowledge base. Proactive suggestions: Surface new product features or underutilized account features. Localized support: Deliver region-specific guidance, such as tax documentation or local regulations, ensuring users feel informed and secure wherever they are. Provide fast, accurate, personal responses for every user When people seek support on issues relating to their money, it’s often an urgent problem requiring immediate and accurate attention. Fin delivers precise, personalized answers for account and portfolio queries – powered by up-to-date knowledge and real-time data. Real-time personalization By connecting to external systems, Fin pulls live transaction data, account details, and other context to provide highly relevant answers. It ensures that even complex questions are handled with precision and clarity. Dynamic content targeting Every customer is unique, so why should their support experience be generic? Fin delivers content tailored to customer segments based on location, plan type, or audience groups, ensuring that every interaction feels relevant and personalized. Scale your support 24/7 across channels Scaling customer service alongside business growth has traditionally been a tricky balance for fintech businesses to strike. To meet rising demand, the only real option was to add more and more headcount to your support team, which was costly, time-consuming, and unsustainable. “In the last 12 weeks, we’ve had an almost 70% resolution rate, which is epic” Fin solves this problem, reducing the need for additional headcount to keep up with customer growth – while increasing efficiency and improving the customer experience. One fintech company that took advantage of Fin’s multichannel capabilities was Sharesies, a retail investment app. “We started using Fin AI Agent over email as soon as it was available and we love it,” says Ruby Picton, their Investor Care Lead. “In the last 12 weeks, we’ve had an almost 70% resolution rate, which is epic.” And because Fin operates 24/7, it also enables global support without the need to hire teams in multiple different timezones. Provide multilingual support at scale Speaking of global support, Fin resolves queries in over 45 languages, with real-time translation ensuring seamless support across multiple countries. It’s like having a native speaker on your team, wherever your customers are. Seamlessly manage high-demand periods Tax season? Market fluctuations? End-of-quarter reporting? Traditional systems can falter during peak periods, forcing support teams to either hire additional staff, make customers endure longer wait times, or risk overworking and burning out their team. Not Fin. It scales effortlessly to handle surging volumes without sacrificing accuracy or care. And because it works across all your channels – email, SMS, WhatsApp, and social – your customers can reach you however they prefer. Keep your customers’ data safe, secure, and compliant In fintech, maintaining compliance isn’t optional – it’s essential for protecting customers and preserving trust. Fin keeps your customer data protected and audit-ready with built-in safeguards for security, privacy, and risk management. “Stay current with changing regulations through your knowledge base, ensuring all responses reflect the latest compliance requirements” Intercom is certified for ISO 27001, ISO 27701, ISO 27018, SOC 2, and much more. Fin helps your fintech business provide a great customer experience, while keeping your customers’ data safe and secure. For example, with Fin you can: Automatically escalate issues: Automatically route customer identified regulated activities to licensed human agents and track resolution of compliance-sensitive issues. Protect risk: Integrate with your existing systems to support KYC processes, AML screening, and transaction monitoring while maintaining a smooth customer experience. Keep pace with regulatory updates: Stay current with changing regulations through your knowledge base, ensuring all responses reflect the latest compliance requirements. Targeting and scheduling: Fin can show up for your customers how and when you decide based on audience, region, channel, and more – helping you control and maintain your support availability even when you’re out of office. See our Trust Center for more details on how Intercom upholds the highest standards for safety and security. Onboard, educate, and retain customers Fostering strong customer loyalty is important in most industries, but is particularly crucial in fintech, where intense competition and high customer acquisition costs make strong retention vital for long-term success. Retention depends on many factors, but chief among them are excellent onboarding experiences and effective product education. This is where Fin can help, acting as an onboarding guide helping new customers with inevitable questions and minimizing confusion. Furthermore, as it’s always equipped with updated help content, Fin can consistently deliver accurate product information whenever required. Continuously improve your customer experience with Insights Fin doesn’t stop at solving problems – it helps your team continuously improve your customer experience. By analyzing every customer interaction, Fin provides real-time insights to uncover patterns, optimize workflows, and enhance your overall support strategy. Invest in your customer relationships with Fin Your customers deserve better than outdated systems and long queues. With Fin, you can deliver personalized, secure, and context-rich support that increases customer trust, satisfaction, and retention. Whether scaling during peak demand, tailoring support for individual customers, or providing actionable insights, Fin helps you turn customer support into a competitive advantage.
