While fiction is often structured as Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3, … Chapter N, some of the best fiction writers are creative with their TOC. Any non-fiction author who doesn’t provide a detailed table of contents TOC is missing an opportunity to help the reader understand the book’s flow before they begin reading it.Below is the Give First: The Power of Mentorship TOC. While pre-orders are available now (the official release is June 24, 2025), the book is physically available at only one bookstore in the world: Composition Shop in Longmont.I’ll be there tomorrow (Tuesday, May 28, 2025) from 10 am to 5 pm except for a break for lunch from 1 pm to 2:30 pm, when I’ll be with a friend who is in town. Join me and buy a copy of the physical book now, rather than waiting for the release date in a month.Additionally, if you’d like to see where I’ll be out and about in public (until I go back into hibernation), take a look at the new Events page on this website. Registration links for any events that require them are in the event details.And now, the TOC for Give First: The Power of Mentorship.",
