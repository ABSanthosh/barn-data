  "text": "February 13, 2025 1:48 PM Developers beware of the haunting downsides of changes to a game’s in-app purchase models. It turns out they can be so catastrophic that they can take the entire game down with them. Such is the case with the iOS version of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, itself a remaster of a 2003 GameCube game then ported to mobile platforms. On all versions of the game including Switch, PlayStation 4, and Android, the player could buy costumes for their character to mimic other Final Fantasy references throughout the series. In the mobile versions specifically, in-app purchases also allowed the player to upgrade from the demo to the full version of the game. Recent changes to this in-app purchase model have glitched out, not giving purchasers their entitlements after buying, and Square-Enix says they cannot fix it. “The issue is due to changes made to the in-app purchases model,” the post on the Final Fantasy series’ official website reads. “Further investigation revealed that we are unable to completely fix the bug and implement the new changes, making it unlikely to resume service for the game. Thus, we must regretfully announce that we will end support for the iOS version of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.” Square Enix states that this bug has only been reported since the final week of January. Refunds for players who did get past the bug to complete purchases are available within a certain timeframe of purchase. It is a rough lesson for Square Enix, considering it is likely Crystal Chronicles on iOS cost some money to port. It can also be an important lesson to impart to the rest of the industry: the small things can still bring the sky crashing down if not handled with the utmost care. GB Daily Stay in the know!
