  "text": "After spending $280 million to help elect Donald Trump, working to dismantle much of the federal bureaucracy through DOGE, and then publicly falling out with the president over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) of 2025, Elon Musk says he wants to form a new political party in the United States. Musk used the July 4th weekend to post about his reasoning for the project, called the America Party. On Saturday, he wrote on X: “When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste \u0026 graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy. Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.” Another tech billionaire appears to see some promise in Musk’s idea. Mark Cuban, former Shark Tank judge and early web entrepreneur, reposted Musk’s declaration with flame and firework emojis. In the ensuing days, Cuban has been more active on Bluesky, a competing social platform. The former Dallas Mavericks owner has been admonished by Bluesky users over his endorsement, largely because Musk has engaged in overtly conspiratorial, racist, and antisemitic behavior in recent months. Yesterday, Cuban wrote on Bluesky: “Like everyone else, I’ve seen what [Musk] has done. And I’ve seen person after person think they could change Trump, only to get burned. In this case, a vengeful Elon could be the opposing force that has a positive impact…It’s not like he didn’t vote dem in previous elections.”Cuban didn’t respond to an Inc. request for comment. Musk also has interest from the political operator and banker Anthony Scaramucci. A former Trump White House staffer who later defected from the GOP and endorsed Kamala Harris in 2024, Scaramucci on Saturday wrote on X that he is “open to discuss” the idea of forming a new political party. The idea of a third political party that shakes up the Democrat and Republican binary isn’t new, but Musk, the richest man in the world, conceivably has the treasure chest to give it a shot. The Tesla CEO had a public split with Trump as his landmark policy bill was being discussed in Congress. Musk decried the bill for adding to the federal deficit, which could balloon by $3.3 trillion over the next decade as public assistance programs are slashed, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Trump’s bill, passed last week, also guts Medicaid benefits and programs such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), otherwise known as food stamps. But Musk could potentially have allies among Silicon Valley’s ultra-rich. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was also posting over the weekend; on X, Altman wrote a reflective post on the 4th of July, saying he felt “politically homeless” due to Democrats’ no longer prioritizing innovation. (Altman didn’t say anything about joining the America Party.) Musk’s stunt is conceivably born of his frustration with the OBBBA. But at this point, nothing seems to have materialized beyond social media bluster. The Federal Election Commission’s website saw various similarly-named groups (like the Real America Party) register on Sunday, but none of them appear to be connected to Musk’s America Party. The final deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, July 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
