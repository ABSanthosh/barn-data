The AI agent can click, type, and submit forms on its own based on a natural language prompt, and users can interrupt it at any time. It's part of OpenAI's effort to make ChatGPT more of a tool capable of handling autonomous tasks instead of just a chatbot that answers questions. As of March, ChatGPT had over 500 million global weekly users.Related: AI Could Replace 200,000 Jobs on Wall Street, According to a New Report. These Are the Jobs Most at Risk. ChatGPT agent can also act as a virtual assistant, connecting to apps like Gmail and Google Calendar to carry out tasks like drafting emails and making appointments. It completes tasks using its own virtual computer and shifts on its own between reasoning and action to carry out instructions.OpenAI says the new tool can \"analyze three competitors and make a slide deck\" — the agent will chart out a course of action, go through websites, and create an editable slideshow. It can also create editable Excel spreadsheets by taking in a prompt like \"make a spreadsheet based on the San Francisco annual comprehensive financial reports (ACFR).\"The agent can also shop online for users, though it will always ask for approval before carrying out a sensitive action, like entering personal information or making a purchase.OpenAI is embedding the agent within ChatGPT and allowing paying users to access it immediately by selecting \"agent mode\" in ChatGPT's dropdown tool menu. The agent starts rolling out today for Pro, Plus, and Team users, with plans to become available to Enterprise and Education customers over the summer.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesOpenAI says the agent could help workers, like financial analysts, complete tasks more quickly.\"We think that this model is actually going to be quite good at low-level, first-, second-year, financial analysis type work that might have taken someone a night to do if they're getting pinged by their boss late at night,\" ChatGPT agent product manager Neel Ajjarapu told The Wall Street Journal.Related: ChatGPT Can Now Complete a Major Task That Would Take a Human Up to 30 Days. Here's How it Works.ChatGPT isn't the first AI tool to be able to make PowerPoint presentations, but it is the most mainstream AI product to offer the agentic capability. Other AI presentation tools include Microsoft Copilot, which is integrated into PowerPoint and can generate presentations from prompts, and Google Workspace add-on SlidesAI.io, which converts any text into a Google Slides presentation. Meanwhile, other companies are leveraging internal AI tools to create slide decks. For example, McKinsey consultants are using an internal AI tool to create PowerPoint presentations, taking over junior employee tasks.OpenAI was valued at $300 billion in March following a $40 billion funding round.ChatGPT agent is a combination of two other agents OpenAI released earlier this year: Operator, which can browse the web to fill out forms and take action like a virtual assistant, and Deep Research, which searches the web for answers to research questions and presents the findings in a paper with citations — though it far exceeds the capabilities of both.Related: The CEO of $61 Billion Anthropic Says AI Will Take Over a Crucial Part of Software Engineers' Jobs Within a Year Join top CEOs, founders and operators at the Level Up conference to unlock strategies for scaling your business, boosting revenue and building sustainable success.",
