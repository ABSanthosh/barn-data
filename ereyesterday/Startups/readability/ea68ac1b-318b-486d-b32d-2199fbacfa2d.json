  "text": "Mobile gaming publisher Sandsoft Games announced today that it is adding three new games to its portfolio of hybrid-casual games: Wizario, Potions \u0026 Spells and Iza’s Supermarket. These three are the first wave of Sandsoft’s global publishing efforts, with several more titles in development and testing — the company plans to offer support for more third-party mobile developers in order to meet increasing demand. The three games are developed by Latvian Kolka Games, Canadian Rogue Harbour Game Studio and Brazilian Izyplay Game Studio, respectively. Wizario is an action-adventure game about fighting monsters; Potions \u0026 Spells is a cozy game about living as a witch; and Iza’s Supermarket is a retail simulator about managing the titular store. All three fit Sandsoft’s professed interest in promising, market-tested hybrid-casual mobile games. David Fernandez, Sandsoft CEO, said in a statement, “Launching Wizario, Potions \u0026 Spells, and Iza’s Supermarket marks an exciting step in expanding our portfolio with fresh and engaging experiences for players worldwide. We’re proud to keep expanding our network of partner studios that share our vision for high-quality, mobile-first gaming.” According to Sandsoft, its last year has been expanding its presence by growing team by 35% and opening a new office in Barcelona. It’s also partnered with NetEase and NEOM and launched the mobile RPG Pocket Necromancer. Its publishing model is focused on support for various publishing tasks, including funding, data and growth marketing. It’s still seeking partnerships with more mobile developers around the world.
