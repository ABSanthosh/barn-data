  "text": "The artificial intelligence industry was flung into chaos recently following the release of DeepSeek’s cheap but powerful new models, named V3 and R1. DeepSeek’s models have been found to match, or even outperform, the performance of OpenAI’s flagship models, but were built for a fraction of the resources used by its larger competitors. The release has already had an effect on the tech industry—and some big names in AI are questioning its legitimacy. DeepSeek, which was founded and funded by Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, wrote in research papers that its V3 model was trained with just 2,048 Nvidia H800 GPUs, a less-advanced series of chips designed specifically for sale in China. The training took 2.78 million GPU hours (the amount of time a GPU cluster spends processing tasks) and cost just under $5.6 million. For comparison, Meta trained its Llama 3 series of models with two clusters, each containing 24,000 GPUs, over a period of 39.3 million GPU hours. In short, DeepSeek says it’s producing big results with a small amount of resources.DeepSeek’s arrival has upended a largely agreed-upon notion that in order to build advanced AI models, more and more GPUs are needed. This assumption is the driving engine behind Nvidia’s success as the undisputed top provider of GPUs. If high-level models can be built with just a few thousand GPUs and a few million dollars, the need for GPUs could decrease drastically. This has already impacted Nvidia’s stock, which fell from $142 to $124 when the stock market opened on Monday. By end of trading on Tuesday, the stock had slightly recovered, and was trading just under $129. Now, AI providers are scrambling to adjust to a post-DeepSeek world. The Information reported that Meta is rushing to readjust its strategy, but other AI companies, and the entrepreneurs behind them, have taken to social media to give their take on the situation and what it means for the AI industry at large.OpenAI cofounder and CEO Sam Altman called DeepSeek’s R1 reasoning system “an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price.” Altman said that OpenAI would “pull up” some of its future releases, but still believes that “more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission.” That’s to be expected, as the need for more compute—or processing power—is the main factor behind Project Stargate, the government-backed joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank that Altman announced with President Trump last week. The project’s financial backers have already committed $100 billion to the construction of AI data centers across the United States. Not everyone is convinced that DeepSeek has been totally truthful about their methods. Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang told CNBC that his understanding is that “DeepSeek has about 50,000 H100 GPUs,” a more advanced chip that Chinese companies are prohibited from using. Meanwhile, Anthropic cofounder and CEO Dario Amodei said that he’s been aware of DeepSeek for some time and had identified it as “more likely to succeed” compared to other Chinese AI startups, and praised their “particularly talented team.” But, he raised his own concerns that DeepSeek has access to more resources than they’re letting on, suggesting that smuggling tens of thousands of advanced GPUs into China “is very possible.” Another DeepSeek skeptic? Elon Musk, who responded to a video on X featuring Wang’s allegations that DeepSeek is lying about its resources with one word: “Obviously.”",
