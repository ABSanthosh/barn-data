  "text": "The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) is widely considered to be a dry and unemotional document. Published by the Department of Transportation, it outlines the basic specifications of all the street signs you could expect to see out on roads and highways across the United States. Most are familiar, but if you dive deeper into its pages, you can find some unsettling relics from darker times. Back in the mid-20th century, America was tangling with the realities of nuclear war. Top generals contemplated targeting strategies, while engineers mused over whether there was anything to be done top stop a torrent of enemy missiles falling across the nation. These superweapons seemed to promise destruction on an overbearing scale, threatening the very existence of human civilization itself. Against this bleak backdrop, government administrators turned to the concept of Civil Defense. The idea was to do whatever could be done to protect the citizens of the nation from the horrors of nuclear war and its immediate aftermath. In turn, the Department of Transport worked up some rather depressing road signs to help people get where they needed to be in these bleak and trying times. In this case, “emergency” means “nuclear apocalypse.” Flip open the 1961 edition of the MUTCD, and you’ll find an important section on Civil Defense. It featured a handful of designs for traffic management in a post-nuclear world. Perhaps most interesting was the “MAINTAIN TOP SAFE SPEED” sign, designated CD-4. It’s purpose was highly unique: The “MAINTAIN TOP SAFE SPEED” sign may be used on highways where radiological contamination is such as to limit the permissable exposure time for occupants of vehicles passing through the area. Since any speed zoning would be impractical under such emergency conditions, no minimum speed limit can be prescribed by the sign in numerical terms. Where traffic is supervised by a traffic regulation post, official instructions will usually be given verbally, and the sign will serve as an occasional reminder of the urgent need for all reasonable speed. Our modern mockup of what this sign would look like in the wild. You really wouldn’t want to be the person sent out to stand there long enough to bolt it up. Base image credit: depositphotos.com Basically, if you saw this sign, you’re supposed to be gunning it as fast as you can while still staying on the road. The intention is to limit your exposure to radiation as much as possible while traveling through contaminated areas. The 1971 edition of the MUTCD expanded further on the Civil Defense section. The DOT had by this time developed a standardized sign for marking directions to fallout shelters, where citizens could wait out radioactive contamination falling from the sky after a nuclear attack. The document also specified a sign for decontamination centers, where those suffering radiation exposure might be treated by experienced personnel. The Fallout Shelter sign, as shown in MUTCD, 1971 edition. A modern version of the sign. Further signs in this series include the “AREA CLOSED” sign used to designate areas of high radiological or biological contamination that are too unsafe for travel. The DOT also specified a blue “Evacuation Route” sign marked with the Civil Defense logo. It was intended to guide citizens to safety along pre-planned routes. Ultimately, the Department of Transport prepared these signs for when things really hit the fan. Thankfully, the worst fears of the Cold War never came to pass, and these signs weren’t needed in any major emergency situation. The “AREA CLOSED” sign is impressively tame. You’d think it would be covered in nuclear warning symbols or something. And yet! Some of these signs persist in the MUTCD standard to the day. The most recent edition still includes some of these signs—like EM4-1b ‘FALLOUT SHELTER’—but now places them under the category of Emergency Management signs. The bleak term of “Civil Defense” is no longer very relevant in government administrative circles. Us car enthusiasts do like driving fast. Still, when the government has put out a sign telling you to floor it, you know the situation has to be dire. In the end, most of these signs have never been put to use, and that’s something we can all be thankful for. Regardless, the Department of Transport stands ready with signage prepared to deal with whatever might happen down the line.
