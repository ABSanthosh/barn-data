  "text": "Call them Generation T—a rising class of Gen Z entrepreneurs who have used TikTok to launch and build brands, and have scaled them with cheap overseas manufacturing. These founders are innovative and resilient—shaped by a global pandemic, rapid technological advances, and political upheaval. But their businesses? They might not be so resilient.As part of the Trump administration’s ongoing trade war, Tariffs on imports from China—where many of these founders manufacture—are now as high as 145 percent. A key import loophole is set to close in May. And by June, TikTok, a massive lifeline for customer acquisition and e-commerce sales, could be banned in the United States. But that’s not all that’s troubling Gen T. Tariff WoesIn 2021, small and midsize companies comprised 41.2 percent of imports from China, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. As the world awaits Trump’s response to China’s newest retaliatory tariffs of 125 percent, founders like Haley Pavone, founder of convertible footwear brand Pashion are already feeling the pressure mount.“How am I even supposed to be trying to run a financial analysis here when the inputs keep changing?” she asks. “I spent four hours building a model around 34 percent tariffs,” she says, explaining the complex math that goes into calculating import fees and duty rates. With tariffs on imports from China now at 145 percent, she says, “its not even clear to us or our brokers what our import rate is right now.”Haley Pavone, founder of Pashion, with one of Pashion’s convertible shoes. Photo: Courtesy companyHer patented heels rely on custom injection molds made in China. When she explored moving her production to Brazil, which for now has lower tariffs, she learned that her molds, which cost roughly $400,000, may not be compatible with Brazilian machinery, which isn’t universal across the world. To switch, she says she’d likely need to scrap them and reinvest the same amount. Vietnam was no better. “[Suppliers] won’t even look at me unless I can commit to 3000 pairs per shoe,” she says. In China, she explained that she can place a minimum order per shoe of 200 pairs — a much more manageable entry point for small businesses.For resource-constrained small businesses, minimum order quantities (MOQ) is a crucial factor in choosing a manufacturer. Several of the founders Inc. spoke to say that it’s not just MOQs that make China the go-to country for small businesses. It’s got the infrastructure, from sourcing material, to prototyping, to packaging, that make this country a one-stop shop for companies trying to build products fast. In Vietnam, for instance, footwear manufacturers still rely on China, importing raw materials that drive up MOQs, cost, complexity, and valuable production time. That puts Gen Z-led startups—many of which are still nascent and in the early stages of testing product-market fit—at a distinct disadvantage.“The only way to describe this situation is an overnight gutting of the profit profile of small businesses,” she says. At one point, she calculated her compounded tariffs could hit 204 percent. That estimate came before Trump’s latest directive, which could push those numbers even higher. Katie Diasti, founder and CEO of period care brand Viv for Your V, shares that anxiety. “There aren’t manufacturers in the U.S. that create the kind of pad that we want to manufacture,” she says. In addition, their organic cotton tampons and menstrual cups, also low-grade medical devices, require specific FDA certifications—certifications she claims are difficult to find from domestic producers.“Some of these manufacturers that make their products here [in America] are still importing their packaging from China or another country,” Diasti says. In fact, just 52 percent of the value of manufactured goods Americans purchased in 2023 was made domestically using U.S.-sourced inputs, according to a Department of Commerce report. The remaining 48 percent relied on foreign materials: 37 percent from imported finished products and 11 percent from imported parts and materials embedded in U.S.-made goods.Tick-Tock for TikTokWhile tariffs are inflating costs, a potential TikTok ban threatens Gen Z brands at the very top of their marketing funnel.TikTok, which has over 1.5 billion monthly active users, has become an invaluable platform for young founders with limited advertising budgets. Notably, a 2025 Adobe study reveals that 34 percent of Gen Z users have searched for brands on the platform. Pavone, who began posting in 2022, now has over 850,000 followers. “I literally just posted a video of how my product works, and that many people were interested,” she says, adding that TikTok generates over 70 percent of her web traffic. “It is a significant marketing tool for us.”  Viv has leaned into TikTok to build a community and break taboos around period care through short-form educational content. According to a 2022 Digiday article, the brand saw a 140 percent spike in sales after its first TikTok series.“So, the TikTok [ban] threat also feels like an existential threat to the marketing of my small business, and to lots of other small businesses,” Pavone says.When asked about other platforms, Pavone describes TikTok as “democratizing the virality process.” “If you have a good idea, you can go viral.” She claims this is because Meta is pay-to-play, and that unlike other platforms, TikTok’s algorithm doesn’t prioritize ad dollars.A ban could begin to unravel all of that. The looming deadline, which is currently extended to June 19, adds even more unpredictability to a moment already defined by volatility.Treading WaterMany of these Gen-Z led brands don’t have deep pockets, making them particularly vulnerable to economic shocks like tariff hikes. According to a 2025 report by PYMNTS, 70 percent of small and medium-sized businesses hold less than four months’ worth of cash reserves, and 45 percent of U.S. small business owners forgo their own paychecks due to cash flow shortages.Pavone says that while her company is growing and profitable, that it relies heavily on cash flow to cover accounts payable, payroll and reinvestment. She describes that these tariffs “will impact the cash readily available on hand—impacting our ability to meet these needs.”So when tariffs increased, then increased again, there wasn’t much wiggle room.Isaac Hetzroni, the 27-year-old founder of sourcing agency Imprint Genius, works with hundreds of brands ranging in size. He’s seen firsthand how fragile their operations are.Isaac Hetzroni founder of Imprint Genius.

It’s just a whole other ball game when you’re manufacturing outside of China.”“China is kind of the easiest place to manufacture products, especially when you are getting started,” he says. But he thinks “the 125 percent tariff is decimating the young aspiring entrepreneur in this capacity.” Viv hasn’t yet raised prices, but Diasti suggests it might be unavoidable. She described how people tend to be more “price sensitive” when it comes to purchasing period care products. “One of our core values is accessibility,” says Diasti, a factor that makes raising prices a balancing act.Her COO, Anna Sise, says Viv is relying on flexibility to navigate a period of major growth during tariff uncertainty. “Part of what we’ve been working on for the past years with our suppliers is really strengthening our supply chain to be able to adapt and be flexible for when things like this do come up… We’re taking it day by day and leaning on the strength of our supplier relationships.” Viv has suppliers in China and Europe.Pass the Tequila Just Call Me Shirley, a Gen Z-led ready-to-drink cocktail brand, is also trying to stay flexible despite feeling the squeeze. They sell Shirley Temple beverages made with vodka and tequila. They also have a non-alcoholic version. Their tequila, sourced by a U.S. based manufacturer from Mexico, already costs more than other spirits.A hand pours the Just Call Me Shirley ready-to-drink Shirley Temple into a glass. Photo: Courtesy company“In general, tequila is more expensive than vodka,” says cofounder Sydney Attis. She provided that her vodka is around $7 a gallon, while tequila is around $35. But, she says, “if we get to a point where the tequila becomes extremely expensive… we have the option to really hone in on the MVP product being vodka and really just ramp up that production.”GENERATION TAll this uncertainty has turned these young CEOs into policy pundits, strategists and spokespeople. Pavone’s TikTok video on the tariff crisis has since gone viral: featured on The Today Show, NewsNation, and even reposted by Mark Cuban, the Shark Tank investor who said “I’m out” to Pavone’s business on the show in 2022. “I was mostly trying to find a creative outlet to air my own frustrations,” she says. “I didn’t anticipate how widely it would be picked up.” But for now, this class of founders continues to adapt. “If it means having to become experts on trade wars, we’ll figure it out,” says Diasti. “We wear so many hats already. The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
