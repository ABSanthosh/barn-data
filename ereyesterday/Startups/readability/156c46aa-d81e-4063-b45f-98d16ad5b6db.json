  "text": "SpeakersChieh Huang Co-founder, BoxedChieh (“Chay”) Huang is the president of the World Economic Forum’s Global Collaboration Village. Prior to his term at the World Economic Forum, Chieh founded and led several private and public technology companies. He was the CEO of an early pioneer in mobile social gaming and was also the co-founder of an artificial intelligence/machine learning company. On the public side, Chieh co-founded and was the CEO of an NYSE-listed technology company. Before his days as an entrepreneur, he was a corporate attorney at a leading international law firm after attending the Johns Hopkins University and Fordham Law School. Chieh has been included in Bloomberg’s 50 People to Watch, Crain’s 40 Under 40, Goldman Sachs’s list of the 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs, and Entrepreneur magazine’s list of the 50 Most Daring Entrepreneurs. People magazine profiled Chieh for its American Dream series, tracking his growth from humble beginnings to leading industry-changing initiatives like the Pink Tax and college tuition reimbursement for front-line employees. Brandon Ivan PeñaFounder, 787 CoffeeBrandon Ivan Peña is a visionary entrepreneur, business coach, and motivational speaker who has redefined the coffee industry through his innovative leadership, customer-focused mindset, and passion for inspiring others. As the driving force behind 787 Coffee, he has gone from purchasing a farm to launching a small coffee business—scaling it into a recognized brand that blends locally grown specialty coffee from Puerto Rico with an unforgettable customer experience. With over a decade of experience in entrepreneurship, branding, and leadership, Peña has cultivated a strong, human-centered work environment. His approach to business goes beyond profitability—he prioritizes community, culture, and purpose, ensuring that both employees and customers feel valued and receive genuine value. Peña’s leadership philosophy is simple: believe in your vision, build with intention, and always serve with heart. His hiring approach has evolved over the years, shifting from “hire fast and let go slow” to “hire slow and let go fast.” When hiring, Peña ensures candidates go through multiple interview rounds with different team leads. In his own interviews, he evaluates a few key factors: Do they maintain eye contact? How do they treat others? Are their responses thoughtful and productive? What types of questions do they ask? How do they react when put on the spot with an interactive request? Born in Mexico and raised in El Paso, Texas, Peña grew up with his sister, Zitlaly. Both helped their single mother, who worked multiple jobs to provide for them. Peña contributed by doing household chores and working his first job at McDonald’s—as the Hamburglar. As a personal challenge to test his commitment and consistency, Peña applied for an MBA program at the University of Miami. While studying, he simultaneously opened 787 Coffee’s flagship shop in New York. A core mission of both Brandon Peña and 787 Coffee is sustainability. From growing coffee in Puerto Rico under shade and without pesticides to reducing plastic waste in coffee shops by using more sustainable drink pouches, Peña remains committed to environmental responsibility.  Mike HofmanEditor-in-chief, Inc.Mike Hofman is the editor-in-chief of Inc. His vision for Inc.—where he was an editor and writer for 15 years earlier in his career—is to convene critical conversations about economic opportunity and fairness, the future of work, innovation and superior execution as drivers of business growth, and the way new technologies such as AI will shape the world for decades to come. Hofman most recently served as executive editor at Fast Company, where he assigned award-winning journalism, helped launch the brand’s premium subscription product, and founded its employee resource group program.
