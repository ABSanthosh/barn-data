  "text": "Worries about the potential pitfalls of artificial intelligence (AI) taking over entire job categories — and putting the humans occupying them out of work — are a standard concern of the technology’s critics. But a new AI app may wind up leading employees in hospitals, clinics, and doctor offices to jump for joy if it can free them from many laborious, time-consuming tasks that now limit the time healthcare professionals can spend with patients.On Monday, Microsoft released its new Dragon Copilot AI product, which is designed to efficiently and painlessly take over the notetaking, summarizing, and other clerical tasks that clinicians now assume during and after patient consultations. The voice-activated app can be used on mobile phones, browsers, or as a desktop feature to capture comments, questions, and observations a doctor or other healthcare professionals air during examinations. It then transforms those into summaries integrating information from patients’ health and treatment histories.As such, Dragon Copilot combines the work of human stenographers, record keepers, and administrative assistants by automatically transcribing notes to create accurate chronicles of patient consultations. Better still, the app also connects to medical databases from which it can pull a variety of relevant data, and offer to physicians for potential use in diagnoses or treatments.The latter function may enhance the information and insights in physicians’ post-visit summaries, providing added value and potentially better care for patients. But in primarily assuming notetaking, composition of referral letters, and other textual and administrative tasks, the AI app may also become a remedy for rising burnout rates among overworked doctors.That exhaustion and lassitude continues plaguing the medical profession, after surging during the pandemic — driving many skilled professionals from the field. The resulting rise in dropout numbers is generated in part by the increase in the volume of patients healthcare workers treat any given week, but also on the even bigger deluge of administrative chores those inflows create.Research indicates clinicians now spend a staggering 28 hours per week on administrative chores, much of which is made up of exactly the kind of note transcription, consultation summarizing, and patient history updating that Dragon Copilot was designed to perform. In doing so, the app combines an earlier Microsoft AI tool automating dictation and scribing, and another providing ambient listening functions. It does that while connected to electronic health records and medical databases stored on the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare.The upshot during a trial period, the company said, was the app saving physicians and other healthcare professionals an average of five minutes per consultation that would have otherwise been used on administrative tasks. That allowed doctors to spend the extra time with existing patients, or use it to schedule an additional 13 new appointments every month.Microsoft said the reduced time spent on record keeping drudge work produced a 70 percent reduction in clinician burnout during testing, and a reported 70 percent improvement in users’ work-life balance. Reflective of that, 93 percent of patients described less harried and frustrated clinicians being “more personable and conversational” during consultations. Before long, doctors may even feel like giving out lollipops again.“Through this technology, clinicians will have the ability to focus on the patient rather than the computer, and this is going to lead to better outcomes and ultimately better health care for all,” Dr. David Rhew, Microsoft’s global chief medical officer, said during a rollout briefing reported by CNBC.Microsoft said Dragon Copilot will be available to North American healthcare professionals in May, then released in other markets afterward. As a result, patients who have grown used to entering often tense and exhausted medical practices on their tiptoes may soon be able to waltz into more relaxed offices to the greetings of drudgery-spared staff. Even so, the return of lollipops is probably too much to hope for.The application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is this Friday, March 7, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
