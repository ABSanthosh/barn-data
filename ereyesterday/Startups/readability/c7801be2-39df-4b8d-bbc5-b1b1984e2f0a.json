An hour later, Musk responded, \"I agree.\"I agree— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 11, 2025Dorsey immediately received pushback from lawyer and former 2024 vice-presidential candidate Nicole Shanahan.Shanahan, who was married to Google co-founder Sergey Brin until 2023, told Dorsey that IP law was the \"only\" barrier between work created by human beings and work by AI.\"IP law is the only thing separating human creations from AI creations,\" Shanahan wrote in a reply to Dorsey's post. \"If you want to reform it, let's talk!\"Dorsey objected, replying that \"creativity\" is what separates humans from AI and that the legal system is currently inhibiting creativity.Jack Dorsey. Photographer: Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesWhile Dorsey may want to end intellectual property law, copyright holders are still holding on to their work. Dozens of cases have been filed over the past few years in U.S. federal court against AI companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta, as authors, artists, and news organizations accuse these companies of using their copyrighted work to train AI models without credit or compensation.AI needs ample training material to keep it sharp. It took about 300 billion words to train ChatGPT, an AI chatbot now used by over 500 million people weekly. AI image generator DALL·E 2 needed \"hundreds of millions of captioned images from the internet\" to become operational. Related: Jack Dorsey Announces His Departure from Bluesky on X, Calls Elon Musk's Platform 'Freedom Technology'The first U.S. ruling on AI copyright law arrived in February when a Delaware federal court ruled that legal research firm Ross Intelligence was not allowed to copy content from Thomson Reuters.Ross Intelligence asserted it was allowed to utilize copyrighted material to train its AI under the fair use doctrine, which permits the use of a copyrighted work in specific circumstances. However, the court dismissed the fair use defense because the AI training data was employed in a commercial context.Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman commented on fair use in AI copyright law at the Aspen Ideas Festival in June. Suleyman stated then that almost all web content was fair use for \"anyone\" to copy or recreate, with the possible exception of some news sites and publishers that have asked not to be scraped. \"That's the gray area, and I think that's going to work its way through the courts,\" Suleyman said, at the time.Related: A Microsoft-Partnered AI Startup Is Being Sued By the Biggest Record Labels in the World",
