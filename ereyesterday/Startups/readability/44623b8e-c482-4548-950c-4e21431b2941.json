It's also a lesson in not accepting the first offer — the company turned down Google's offer of $23 billion last summer.Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport wrote in a blog post that joining Google Cloud will \"enable us to execute and innovate even faster\" as both businesses \"are fueled by the belief that cloud security needs to be easier, more accessible, more intelligent, and democratized, so more organizations can adopt and use cloud and AI securely.\"Rappaport noted that \"attackers aren't slowing down\" and are now \"using the most innovative technologies.\"Related: Andy Cohen Lost 'A Lot of Money' to a Highly Sophisticated Scam — Here's How to Avoid Becoming a Victim YourselfScammers are certainly getting more sophisticated, from toll text schemes to AI impersonations.

It's used by about 50% of Fortune 100 companies, according to the company.
