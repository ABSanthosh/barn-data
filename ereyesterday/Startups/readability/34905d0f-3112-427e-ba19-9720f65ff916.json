Spotted: Correct storage is essential for food companies to maintain the safety and quality of their produce, but it comes at a carbon cost, with cold chains generating around one per cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Enter Sunswap. As the demand for sustainable transport solutions grows, the UK-based clean tech startup is leading the charge to decarbonise cold chain logistics. Focused on reducing the environmental impact of refrigerated transport, Sunswap has developed an innovative solar and battery-powered refrigeration technology that offers a low-carbon alternative to diesel units. Sunswap’s fully electric transport refrigeration unit (TRU), the Sunswap Endurance, is designed to match or exceed the performance of diesel-powered systems. It does so by combining advanced battery technology with solar panels installed on the trailer roof. This setup not only eliminates emissions but also enables rapid charging, ensuring uninterrupted performance for fleet operators while reducing overall energy consumption. On top of its cutting-edge hardware, the Sunswap Endurance is equipped with a cloud-based telematics system. This allows operators to monitor and control the refrigeration units remotely, improving efficiency and delivering significant operational savings. With the integration of renewable energy and smart technology, the startup offers a practical, scalable solution for zero-emission cold chain logistics. Earlier this year, Sunswap secured £17.3 million in funding in a round led by BGF. The company has already worked with the likes of Tesco and Müller, but the new investment will help Sunswap expand customer trials, as well as support increased production. Sunswap aims to expand its reach across the UK and Europe, driving the transition to greener cold chain transport and helping businesses achieve their sustainability goals.
