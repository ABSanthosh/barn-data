You may need a little bit of upfront capital to get the right equipment and reliable transportation to get to and from job sites. However, many people already have these items covered. And there are minimal ongoing costs to consider. Landscaping is great if you’re looking for ideas that are not home-based and where there are minimal costs to get started.Consulting BusinessDepending on your industry and your skills, having your own consulting business could be your next business idea.
