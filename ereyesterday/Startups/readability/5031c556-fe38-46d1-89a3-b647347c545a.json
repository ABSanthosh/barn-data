  "text": "Grocery giant Kroger has found itself on the defensive for its adoption of electronic shelf labels (ESLs) in some locations. Critics, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Robert P. Casey Jr., worry the technology, which lets companies remotely change prices at a moment’s notice, could lead to dynamic “surge” pricing that could make it even harder for lower-income Americans to afford food. And shoppers took to social media to express their outrage. They’re not alone. Representative Rashida Tlaib, of Michigan’s 12th district, in a letter to Kroger’s CEO expressing concerns about the ESLs, wrote, “We’ve found big retailers with little regional competition can extract large profits simply by adjusting prices of essential goods like food items. My concern is that these tools will be abused in the pursuit of profit, surging prices on essential goods in areas with fewer and fewer grocery stores.” She also expressed concerns that facial recognition technology in Kroger stores could be used to discriminate when it comes to pricing.Kroger, to be clear, says it does not engage in surge pricing and has no plans to. In a statement to Inc., a company spokesperson said the electronic shelf labels would, in fact, lower prices.“Kroger’s business model is built on a foundation of lowering prices to attract more customers,” the spokesperson said. “Everything we do is designed to support this strategy, and customers are shopping more with Kroger now than ever because we are fighting inflation and providing great value. To be clear, Kroger does not and has never engaged in ‘surge pricing.’ Any test of electronic shelf tags is designed to lower prices for more customers where it matters most. To suggest otherwise is not true.”Making an accusation of dynamic pricing is an easy way to provoke outrage these days. Ridesharing services have been chastised for their use of the model. And when Wendy’s mentioned it would roll out digital menu displays at its restaurants and test dynamic pricing on some menu items, it came under heavy criticism from people who thought it would increase prices during its busiest periods, something the company denied.There are, however, industries where dynamic pricing is widely used. Airlines change ticket prices frequently, while the cost of flying from point A to point B remains steady. Hotels, also, adjust their prices without warning, going up or down by hundreds of dollars on the basis of demand. Even a trip to Disney World can fluctuate by several hundred dollars, depending on when you go.Those are for luxury purchases, though. When the threat of dynamic pricing is introduced to core necessities, that tends to get more attention.The anger that accompanies talk of dynamic pricing appears to stem from shoppers fearing they might be taken advantage of by companies—and charged more unfairly. Others are concerned that certain segments of the population might be charged more based on their race, gender, or geographic location. For industries that have found a successful way to incorporate dynamic pricing into their business model, though, it not only can boost the bottom line, but also gives them more flexibility to adjust to a changing business environment, incorporating things like rising fuel prices and actions by competitors. “There’s a legal aspect to this and an ethical aspect,” says Saloni Firasta Vastani, an associate professor in the practice of marketing at Emory University’s Goizueta Business School and author of Purpose-Driven Pricing. “From a legal standpoint, stores are allowed to change prices. You can charge at the high end for whatever you want. We see that in the pharmaceutical industry as well. From an ethical standpoint, you can really misuse technology to underserve the most vulnerable in our society.”Part of the backlash Kroger is facing stems from the fact that few grocery stores currently use ESLs. As a result, there is no industry norm for this sort of thing, which raises consumer fears, especially in an election year where accusations of grocery store price gouging have been front page news for months.Vastani, however, said she suspects grocery shoppers would actually be OK with dynamic or surge pricing if there was some rhyme and reason to it.“If, on the weekend, grocery stores across the board were going to be, say, 20 percent more expensive because they have more traffic, people might be OK with it because that’s an industry standard,” she said. “Or they might be willing to pay more for milk that expires in a month rather than a gallon that expires in a few days.”ESLs do have some practical applications. Stores can change prices or launch sales without workers having to manually update shelf pricing, which can be cumbersome and lead to confusion if price tags aren’t updated quickly enough. They’re also a quick way to lower prices and clear shelves of slow-moving merchandise.Kroger declined to address whether it plans to roll the technology out in more stores or its other brands, which include Fred Meyer, Ralphs and Harris Teeter. Vastani, though, said it wouldn’t surprise her—once the current tempest cools down.“Kroger is one of the largest players in the market,” she said. “I have a sense that the digital boards are going to become more common.”",
