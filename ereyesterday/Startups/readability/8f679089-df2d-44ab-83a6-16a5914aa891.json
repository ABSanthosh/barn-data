  "text": "Small business owners aren’t thrilled about President Trump’s ever-changing slate of foreign import tariffs—and many of them are taking to social media to say so.“We are a bootstrapped business that has been around for eight years and are a true example of living the American dream,” wrote Steven Borrelli, CEO and founder of the clothing company Cuts, in an X post on Tuesday. “I voted for you in 2016, 2020, and 2024 because I believed in your vision for the country—and I still do. However, the recent tariff changes are happening too quickly.”In concert with the recent repeal of the de minimis exemption (which excludes packages worth less than $800 from import duties), the rising tariffs on Chinese imports “will be the death of thousands of e-commerce companies” just like his, Borrelli added.He’s one of the many American entrepreneurs who’ve been left flummoxed by not just the wide slate of new tariffs but also the attendant uncertainty about which ones will actually stick long-term. And business owners aren’t the only ones unsure of how to plan for the future: on the capital side, some investors are pulling back until ground truths become clearer.Trump is currently touting duties of up to 245 percent on Chinese imports, 25 percent duties on select goods and materials from both Canada and Mexico, and 10 percent duties on imports from almost all other countries. Although the global tariffs are set to increase in three months, other product-specific tariffs remain in flux, and nearly all of the president’s tariff-related pronouncements have been subject to change.“The way these changes have been handled creates tremendous uncertainty for brands like ours,” said Borrelli, the clothing company founder. “By placing tariffs on Vietnam and other countries, and then changing them so quickly, we are left unsure of what to do. More importantly, we need time to adjust to new legislation.”Chitra Agrawal, founder of the Indian packaged foods brand Brooklyn Delhi, is in a slightly different boat but is facing parallel issues. Her company’s jarred products—such as date tamarind chutney and golden coconut curry—are made in America, Agrawal says in an Instagram post she made Monday. But, almost by definition, she relies on Indian ingredients and spices that aren’t grown at scale in the U.S.“The tariffs that are being put in place ultimately will be paid by you, the consumers,” Agrawal tells her followers in the video. “These tariffs are not just going to affect Indian products like ours, but probably most every product in the grocery store, [from] chocolate and coffee to olive oil and wine.”A small business like hers, she adds, doesn’t have as large of a margin as a bigger company might—and being forced to raise prices could decrease customer demand and make her entire company no longer viable.Jing Gao, the founder and CEO of Chinese food brand Fly By Jing—known for their viral Sichuan chili crisp condiment—faces a similar dilemma. Gao said in a LinkedIn video posted last Friday that her products have gone from facing 15 percent tariffs to 160 percent tariffs since Trump’s protectionist campaign began. (Again, Chinese tariffs now reportedly stand at a maximum of 245 percent.)“We are in a new reality where higher tariffs are probably here to stay,” the founder says. “We continue to prioritize the sourcing and manufacturing of our core sauce products in my home town in Sichuan. The integrity of our ingredients, their specific provenance and the craftsmanship of our products are highly local to Sichuan, and will continue to be.”Some of those ingredients—including fermented black beans, tribute peppers, er jing tiao chilis and cold-pressed caiziyou rapeseed oil—can’t be grown anywhere else, she adds, and are integral to the product.“We are prioritizing finding solutions that will allow us to maintain our current prices,” Gao continues. “This is temporary, and the only thing that we can do is continue to stay true to our core and make the best possible product.”International ingredients—not just Indian spices and Chinese peppers but also French wines and Japanese matcha teas—are clear-cut casualties of the new tariff landscape, since their appeal is so explicitly linked to their country of origin. But more standard manufactured goods will face blowback from the new tariffs, too, such as the Busy Baby children’s products that entrepreneur Beth Benike manufactures in China but sells in America.“I would 100 percent manufacture in the U.S. if it was possible,” Benike says in an Instagram video posted on April 7. But past efforts to onshore her production were stymied by the lack of available food-grade silicone in America, she adds, and importing the (again, Chinese) manufacturing equipment needed to start up a factory simply isn’t realistic.Instead, she’s left relying on Chinese manufacturing—and thus now faces massive new taxes to import her own products.“I currently have two containers worth of Busy Baby products ready to ship,” she says, but amid rising tariffs on Chinese imports—which were 104 percent at the time she recorded her video but have since risen even higher—it’s become cheaper to just bail on the $160,000 worth of merch. “I am leaving them there, because I simply cannot afford to ship them here.”The entrepreneur continues: “I don’t know what to do—and I’m terrified for my business.”The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
