Illustration: Getty Images.Want to attract workers without breaking the bank? More companies seem to be leaning on one offering: schedule flexibility. In ZipRecruiter’s Q3 Survey of New Hires, 45 percent of respondents said they have “greater schedule flexibility in their new job,” compared to 42 percent in the third quarter of 2023. This comes as the percentage of new hires receiving pay gains, signing bonuses, and even work-from-home flexibility has declined since last year.  This finding might seem unexpected, says Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, especially years after the start of the pandemic and its proliferation of more flexible working arrangements. But she believes it reflects continued competition for talent as well as an emphasis on cost-containing measures for companies.  “Employers are looking for a way to compete and stand out that doesn’t hurt their bottom line as much,” Pollak says.  Indeed, while compensation, people and culture, and other factors carry more weight for workers choosing their new jobs, according to ZipRecruiter’s findings, 16 percent of new hires in this quarter’s survey said they accepted their job offer because of the opportunity for a flexible schedule.  It’s a perk that’s not just popular with remote-capable employees, either. According to a 2023 survey from Gallup, “time” flexibility — which could entail choosing which days or hours to work — was more desired by onsite employees than location flexibility.  It can also especially appeal to certain groups of employees, according to the ZipRecruiter data: Women were more likely than men to gain this offering when switching jobs (49 percent compared to 41 percent) as were “parents with young children” compared to workers without (51 percent compared to 43 percent).  When it comes to flexible offerings, small businesses can have an advantage, Gleb Tsipursky, a behavioral scientist and the CEO of the future-of-work consultancy Disaster Avoidance Experts, previously told Inc., as they can be “more nimble and flexible” than larger companies in making changes to meet employee desires.  But allowing for this schedule flexibility can also be challenging for employers, Pollak says, “to try to make sure they have right coverage at all times and the right mix of employees.”  Even so, she says, the low cost and popularity with employees can make it an appealing option: “It is increasingly demanded by younger workers, and it’s become an expectation.”Refreshed leadership advice from CEO Stephanie Mehta",
