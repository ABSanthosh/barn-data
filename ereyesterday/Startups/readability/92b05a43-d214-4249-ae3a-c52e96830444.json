  "text": "Building an executive team for the first time can be daunting. There are so many options and many voices to take into account. Not having the experience can easily lead you to the wrong people and greatly affect the growth and wellness of your company.  The following tips will help guide you to the best people for your business.  1. Friends don’t make the best coworkers. Look outside your circle. It may be tempting to bring on people you’ve known for years and have built personal relationships with. You want your friends to be a part of your success, you know you can trust them, and maybe they’re even slightly interested in your vision. However, it’s the number one mistake I see executives make.  Here’s why: Professional relationships require different dynamics than personal ones. Combining the two can lead to conflicts or blurred boundaries when you’re caught between being a good friend and being an effective CEO.  Imagine bringing on a friend from college. You know they’ve been successful in marketing positions at other organizations, so while on the search for a chief marketing officer, it seemed natural to approach him.  Fast forward eight months into working with him and you find yourself needing to guide him and reexplain your vision and how to accomplish it. He handles the tasks okay, but when it comes to leading or taking initiative, he falls short. Now you’re in a position where you know there are better options out there, but you don’t want to let down a friend.  That said, friendships can still exist in the workplace, but they’ve likely formed from working relationships. Ideally, you want people who can challenge you, have necessary skills, and don’t have the baggage of being your friend previously.   2. Consider diversity. Diversity is an unpopular word in certain circles these days, but it is not a dirty word or just a buzzword. It’s a proven driver of innovation, creativity, and problem-solving—all factors you want in an executive team. This is perhaps another reason to rethink hiring friends to lead beside you: You want people who have different experiences from you.  Diversity doesn’t just refer to race, as many people think, but also gender, age, background, and perspectives. Creating a team with unique thinkers will inspire innovation and problem-solving at an accelerated rate. A varied team will also better understand and relate to a broader customer base.  3. Make up for your weaknesses.  When working with clients, I conduct an in-depth assessment about each team member’s learning styles and tendencies. After reviewing individual forms, I often discover companies led by team members who all excel in the same areas. Whether it be preferring quantitative information or admitting to a lack of creativity—too much of the same isn’t ideal.  Start by acknowledging your weaknesses as a CEO and then seek people with those strengths. Each member should complement the others. By recognizing areas where you lack expertise or experience, you can partner with people who fill those gaps. A self-aware founder also creates a dynamic of vulnerability and trust that will be crucial for a healthy culture.  4. Write out your culture.  Company culture is the foundation of your organization. It’s easy to think of it as something that just “happens” organically, but it’s better to define and document it early on.  A culture starts from a group of common values, beliefs, and preferences. You must decide these before finding your team members. So, ask yourself, “What values do you prioritize in business?”  Once you know these guidelines, you can find people who align with those preferences. This will ensure consistency in decision-making, collaboration, and culture. Make sure when interviewing candidates, you ask them instead of telling them. You want the most authentic answers provided.  Ultimately, building a great team is an evolving process. The earlier you take these lessons to heart and put them into play, the better positioned you’ll be for long-term success. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
