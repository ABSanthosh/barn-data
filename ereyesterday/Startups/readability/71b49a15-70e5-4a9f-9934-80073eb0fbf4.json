  "text": "May 17, 2025 2:30 PM The crowd at GamesBeat Summit 2024.Image Credit: Mike Pyatt/GamesBeat I’ve posted the updated and final agenda for our GamesBeat Summit 2025 event (25% off discount code: gbs25dean25) and thought it would be good to post a guide on what to expect on May 19-20 in LA. This post is organized by subject matter. On our first day, May 19, we’ll start out with a couple of hours of networking starting around 11:30 a.m. in the lobby of the Marriott Marina del Rey (4100 Admiralty Way, Marina del Rey). Then we’ll get started at 1:30 p.m. with four small group sessions at a time, all downstairs from the lobby. These are hour-long sessions and they answer our attendees’ desire for more engagement with speakers. These small rooms have about 65-seats each (for three of the recorded sessions) and 35 seats for the roundtable room (Catalina). Audience Q\u0026A will be encouraged in these sessions, though some will opt for written questions. Our roundtables are not recorded, with Chatham House rules, where you can say what was said but not who said it. We’ll close out day one with a reception at 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. (Kicked off by Dean Takahashi and Gina Joseph of GamesBeat and Peter Levin of Griffin Gaming Partners). Gina Joseph and I will come out on stage at around 9:30 am and then I’ll kick things off with a short opening speech around 9:35 a.m. Then, throughout the day, we’ll have more traditional 30-minute talks on two stages (California and Promenade rooms) as well as two roundtable rooms (Malibu/Santa Monica and Venice/Peninsula). I’ll give closing thanks at 5:30 p.m. on May 20. The big topics: AI in games and growth opportunities Tynan Sylvester created RimWorld while Owen Mahoney spent a decade each at EA and Nexon. As noted in one one of our social posts, we’ve got a number of sessions on AI and gaming. The hype around AI reminds me of some years ago of how we had lots of sessions on blockchain games or the metaverse, but AI is showing early results and we’ve heard that this is what people want to talk about. I don’t see these as repetitive sessions. Rather, they present attendees with choice, with exposure to many different bright minds on their own perspectives of the AI revolution. The sessions include high-level strategic views of AI in entertainment and games with Owen Mahoney formerly of Nexon, Bing Gordon of Kleiner Perkins, Mitch Lasky of Benchmark and Tynan Sylvester of Ludeon. (2:30 pm -3:30 pm in Palisades downstairs room on May 19). We’ll also have a talk on surprising uses of AI in game creation with Kayla Comalli, Neil Young, and Irena Pereira (3:30 pm-4:30 pm in Malibu/Santa Monica on May 19). AI in Gaming presented by Amazon Web Services (AWS) will include Ashwin Raghuraman, Hilary Mason, J. Aaron Farr, and moderator Chris Melissinos.

Diversity sessions Rachel Kaser is a GamesBeat writer. More than 54% of our speakers come from diverse backgrounds, and 35% women. And we continue to focus on diversity in the gaming industry for many of our topics. On day two, we get started with our tenth Women in Gaming Breakfast (meant for women, at 8:30 a.m. Pacific – 9:25 a.m.) Presented by Xsolla, that session (starting at 9 a.m.) will be moderated by GamesBeat’s Rachel Kaser and include speakers Carla Bedrosian of Xsolla, Angela Dalton of Signum Growth Dot Play and Nancy MacIntyre of World Winner.

(3:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. at California ballroom on May 20). And our lone debate of the conference is entitled, “Is there still growth ahead for gaming?” The years of double-digit games market growth are over. COVID accelerated things, but the writing’s been on the wall for a while. Even live-service games have shown themselves to be mostly zero-sum, while esports, the blockchain, and the metaverse have done very little to move the needle. So what’s next for the games market? This debate features game economist Catalin Alexandru, Michael Pachter of Wedbush and moderator Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics (1:30 p.m. – 2:30 p.m. in Malibu/Santa Monica room). Politics and gaming Karla Reyes founder and studio director at Anima Interactive. Politics has divided us across the country, and so it’s no surprise that some political topics have risen to the fore at our event. “Gaming the government” is about the experiences that gaming industry professionals have had in the U.S. federal government. Mark Deloura of Level Up Games (formerly Obama’s White House lead on games) and Paul Fischer of Accenture (formerly of the U.S. State Department).

This session is a must for anyone seeking to refine their approach to monetization in a player-first era. (roundtable at 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. on May 19 at Catalina room). One of the most interesting new models for helping brands connect with players comes from Twin Galaxies in a session entitled, “The competitive layer you’re missing: How game brands are building loyalty without adding extra code.” In a world where attention is fleeting and communities are fractured, competition might just be the secret glue. This session explores how game publishers and brands are using no-code, community-driven competitions to generate positive player sentiment, drive repeat engagement, and foster long-term loyalty. Learn how a novel approach has turned casual players into invested communities and why competitive formats are emerging as a must-have in the modern live ops toolkit. A talk by Zack Rozga and Jace Hall of Twin Galaxies (1:30 pm – 2:30 pm on May 19 in the Venice/Peninsula room).
