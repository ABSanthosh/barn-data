  "text": "Organizations have traditionally conducted exit interviews as their standard practice. Before leaving the organization, employees undergo interviews that are meant to determine why they made the decision to leave. Was it a better salary elsewhere? A lack of growth opportunities?A strained relationship with their manager? A LinkedIn survey shows that 70 percent of employees would leave a job if they had a bad manager.Exit interviews provide important feedback but they cannot repair damaged relationships or keep skilled employees who have already left. After losing the staff member the organization must review the resulting damage and do something about it.‘Stay’ interviews mitigate problems.However, there’s actually a better and more effective approach—one that is proactive instead of after the fact, when it’s too late to do anything about the employee who’s leaving. Forward-thinking companies are implementing what’s known as stay interviews. What’s a stay interview? A conversation designed to elicit information that would help a top performer want to stay at your company instead of leave. They enable organizations to address employee issues before frustration and disillusionment result in resignations.The core principle behind stay interviews is simple: Identify the elements that drive motivation and contentment among your top employees and then consistently support those elements. You can identify potential problems that might lead to employee resignations by having regular conversations with current employees that establish an open dialogue.Says Erin Pappo, a human-resources manager with Massachusetts digital design studio RLMG, “Instead of waiting for an employee to become so unhappy or disengaged that they resign, it is critical for companies to get in front of potential problems and correct employee satisfaction and engagement issues before they arise.”Ask these questions to retain talent.To keep a finger on the pulse of your people, regularly conduct stay interviews with them. This will help you better understand problems in your organization before they become so bad that you lose your best and your brightest. To get the most out of a stay interview, Pappo suggests that you ask these 10 specific questions:1. The last time you went home and said, “I had a great day, I love my job,” what happened that day?2. The last time you went home and said, “That’s it, I can’t take it anymore,” what happened that day?3. What is really different here that makes you proud to be an employee?4. Is your manager effective? If so, what do they do that you value the most? If not, what do you wish they would do more of?5. What do you like most or least about working here?6. What might tempt you to leave?7. What talents are not being used in your current role?8. What would you like to learn here?9. What motivates (or demotivates) you?10. What can your manager do to best support you?Stay interviews will enable your organizations to transition from simply reacting to issues to proactively engaging with your employees. You’ll be able to intervene sooner to create a better workplace environment and culture that will boost productivity and substantially lower employee turnover rates.Why not give stay interviews a try and see how they work for you?The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is Friday, March 7, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
