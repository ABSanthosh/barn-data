  "text": "Actress, author, and entrepreneur Lili Reinhart is a natural on camera, but that doesn’t mean she was a born social media influencer. The star, made famous from her breakout role in the young adult television series Riverdale, is candid with her more than 30 million followers on TikTok and Instagram combined. On those platforms, she shares about her career and newest entrepreneurial enterprise, but also gets personal about her life, mental health struggles, and—notably—her journey with acne. Reinhart has dealt with acne since she was 12 years old—all while performing under the scrutiny of millions of fans. That struggle prompted her to launch her skin care company, Personal Day, last October to create acne-safe products for herself and others.  Today, social media is a critical tool for entrepreneurs looking to boost their reach. Recognizing that potential, Reinhart has adopted some unconventional means. “I thought, I’m seeing all these Crumbl Cookies reviews that are ASMR—people are eating into a microphone. That seems fun,” she reflected during a conversation at Inc. Founders House at tech and business festival SXSW. “I literally grew my TikTok by multiple millions from doing ASMR.” Personal Day makes skin care products with acne-safe ingredients, which Reinhart says she couldn’t easily find when she was dealing with her own acne. Products include Doing the Work Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment, Full Clarity Cleansing Powder, Dive Deep Mevalonic Moisturizer, and Even Keel Resurfacing Peel. Products feature active ingredients such as salicylic and azelaic acids, niacinamide, zinc hyaluronate, and squalane oil.  The advisory board of the company is also packed with experts, such as triple board-certified dermatologist Mamina Turegano, Reinhart’s personal aesthetician Sarah Ford, and psychologist and social worker Courtney Tracy. Reinhart says their expertise has been crucial to ensuring the brand checks the boxes in terms of safety and efficacy. “I tried building this skin care line a few years ago with a completely different team, and it didn’t work because it just didn’t have meaning. I was not just going to create a brand to create a brand—that doesn’t make sense. And I started working with an aesthetician whose name is Sarah Ford, and she does Megan Fox and Ariana Grande and these beautiful big people,” she says. “I started working with her and it was a light-bulb moment.” The company also offers an ingredient checker that Reinhart says people can use to screen skin care products from other companies to identify acne-triggering ingredients.   “You can copy and paste your ingredients of your makeup primers—that’s a big one—or foundations, and put it in the website and make sure it tells you if there’s a pore-clogging ingredient in there, because I find that a lot of makeup, a lot of primers, a lot of moisturizers have really bad stuff in them, and it’s causing breakouts,” she adds. Reinhart invited Tracy, who holds a doctorate in psychology, to join her board to ensure there’s a mental health component to Personal Day. When she was dealing with acne, particularly when filming Riverdale, Reinhart says she often felt “miserable” and “left out.” She says Personal Day is tying in that influence, mostly through social media at the moment, but may expand once the brand gets more established.“We really just want to acknowledge and feel like a big sister as a brand that sees you and sees the acne experience and knows that you can feel left out when you have that experience,” Reinhart says. “Let’s try to make it maybe a little bit more joyful or have an aesthetically pleasing calm, ASMR, cozy TikTok that you can watch for 20 seconds that might lift your spirits a little bit or just make you feel seen.” As for her own relationship with social media, Reinhart says it changed following filming of her mystery thriller American Sweatshop, which premiered March 8 at SXSW. The film follows Daisy Moriarty, who works as a content moderator for a tech company and routinely sees the worst parts of the internet. Although Reinhart admits she is no “genius beating the algorithm,” she says she has taken steps to cultivate a healthier social media experience for herself. “I’m just trying to go with the app and engage and save things that are happier and lighter so that when I do end my day scrolling on TikTok, which I do, I am seeing things that are making me laugh and that are making me happy and not giving me existential dread at the end of the day,” she says.
