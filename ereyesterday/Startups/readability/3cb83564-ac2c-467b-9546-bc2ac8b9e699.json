  "text": "The Trump Administration may have paused federal renewable energy and EV-related funding—but some companies are still charging ahead with plans to build out EV charging infrastructure.Ridesharing platform Revel landed a $60 million loan from New York state to build out 267 new charging stalls across nine sites in New York City. Meanwhile, IONNA, a joint venture from eight leading automakers, came out of beta earlier this month and announced the national release of its network of rest stop-style charging stations called “Rechargeries.”“In support of the transition to a clean energy economy, it is critical that we continue to build electric vehicle infrastructure to ease the shift to EV ownership for more New Yorkers, especially those in urban areas,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a Feb. 10 statement about the Revel funding.The loan demonstrates commitment at the state level to continue funding EVs and charging infrastructure even as the federal government pulls back. In November, for example, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced an intention to reinstate state-level EV rebates should Trump discontinue federal tax incentives. The Revel loan was made available by the NY Green Bank (NYGB), New York’s clean energy investment fund, and a division of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). The NYGB has committed about $2.4 billion to the state’s renewable energy economy including $383 million in clean transportation, according to the announcement.  Meanwhile IONNA, a project of BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, and Toyota, is pushing ahead with plans to bring over 1,000 charging bays online in 2025 all across the country following a “rigorous testing phase in late 2024.” The broader goal of the project is to install 30,000 fast charging points by 2030. “This effort is more than just deploying infrastructure; it is a substantial investment in American jobs and manufacturing,” a February announcement reads. “Each of the 30,000 Charging Bays built over the next 5 years representing [sic] new jobs across the nation, cutting-edge technological innovation, and a vision to open America’s roads to driver choice.”Just days after IONNA’s announcement, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration wrote a memo to state-level Department of Transportation directors directing them to suspend deployment plans related to the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. Billions of dollars have already been allocated under the program, which was meant to create a network of EV chargers nationwide. The memo indicates Trump’s DOT plans to rewrite program guidelines. Some experts say the order is illegal, according to Wired, which first reported the memo.",
