That’s how many franchises include oil changes in their list of vehicle care services.And with many customers hanging on to older vehicles, franchises that have branched out to include basic repair and maintenance services are busier than ever. The average customer drives about 15,000 miles a year and changes oil every 5,000 miles. This is responsible for generating revenue of $7 billion for the oil change industry annually.Few franchises operate by only making oil changes. The add-on services provided by the franchises, such as tire changes, are the money makers. If you’re a skilled business person but know nothing about vehicles, don’t write off oil change franchises. All of them include intensive training and support.Mobile oil change franchises are poised to boom, especially as more people work from home. People are finding it very convenient to have the auto service come to their location, whether it is to their home or to their place of employment.Why You Should Start an Oil Change FranchiseRecurring Demand: Vehicles constantly need oil changes at regular intervals, ensuring a steady stream of customers.

This turnkey approach can simplify the startup process and increase the likelihood of success.Potential for Growth: Once you set up your first location, the franchise model provides opportunities for expansion.

Owners should expect to invest between $100,000 and $300,000 to acquire the necessary inventory, as well as the tools and equipment required by the industry.Some of the equipment can include tire-changing tools, air wrenches, and air compressors, as well as costly computer diagnostic equipment. Mechanics need an arsenal of hand tools, and the business requires a steady stream of inventory, including belts, filters, hoses, spark plugs, and all the various fluids that vehicles need.The additional costs for the franchises can vary. The cost may be lower for franchises that already own real estate and tools/equipment. You may be able to convert an existing building that you already own. Not all franchises allow such a conversion.Are oil change franchises profitable?Revenue for franchises is about $7 billion annually, shared by 4,000 franchises. An individual franchise typically takes in about $600,000 in annual gross revenue. Of that, the franchise owner should take home six figures or more, earning $100,000 minimum net.Those figures are based on a robust and challenging work schedule. The numbers reflect a typical month at an auto service franchise, including 1,200 oil changes a month. Yep, that’s a lot. With simple math, that’s 40 per day.In other words, you won’t be popping a lawn chair out of a bag and checking out the sound system in a customer’s vehicle. The industry is based on hard work, timely service, and repairs. You’re responsible for keeping those vehicles rolling, on the road, and in and out of your business.How do you start an oil change business?Starting the business begins with your research into the market for these franchises, including new technology, equipment, industry trends, and more.That’s why many aspiring owners consider franchises because the numbers can be proven by the franchisor. The key to a successful oil change franchise is marketing and location. If you have no automotive experience, no worries; training is provided for the franchises.Image: Depositphotos.comMore in: Franchise Opportunities",

Owners should expect to invest between $100,000 and $300,000 to acquire the necessary inventory, as well as the tools and equipment required by the industry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome of the equipment can include tire-changing tools, air wrenches, and air compressors, as well as costly computer diagnostic equipment. Mechanics need an arsenal of hand tools, and the business requires a steady stream of inventory, including belts, filters, hoses, spark plugs, and all the various fluids that vehicles need.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe additional costs for the franchises can vary. The cost may be lower for franchises that already own real estate and tools/equipment. You may be able to convert an existing building that you already own. Not all franchises allow such a conversion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAre oil change franchises profitable?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eRevenue for franchises is about $7 billion annually, shared by 4,000 franchises. An individual franchise typically takes in about $600,000 in annual gross revenue. Of that, the franchise owner should take home six figures or more, earning $100,000 minimum net.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose figures are based on a robust and challenging work schedule. The numbers reflect a typical month at an auto service franchise, including 1,200 oil changes a month. Yep, that’s a lot. With simple math, that’s 40 per day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn other words, you won’t be popping a lawn chair out of a bag and checking out the sound system in a customer’s vehicle. The industry is based on hard work, timely service, and repairs. You’re responsible for keeping those vehicles rolling, on the road, and in and out of your business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow do you start an oil change business?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eStarting the business begins with your research into the market for these franchises, including new technology, equipment, industry trends, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s why many aspiring owners consider franchises because the numbers can be proven by the franchisor.
