  "text": "February 20, 2025 3:47 PM Carter Lipscomb, a game industry veteran, has passed away.Image Credit: Carter Lipscomb Carter Lipscomb, a game industry veteran with a big personality, has passed away. Lipscomb’s family made a post on his behalf, and it was written in Lipscomb’s own cheerful voice. “My family knows that if this ever happened, then to write this note on my behalf and keep it light and keep it real but keep it real light. I hope they did right by me,” Lipscomb said. On LinkedIn, Lipscomb’s profile shows he was Doctor Business and business development specialist at Iron Galaxy Studios since 2019. Before that, he was director of publisher relations for Sony Interactive Entertainment for 11 years. Lipscomb always had a way of making people feel comfortable. Lipscomb was also the cofounder of the Video Game Supper Club in San Francisco alongside Christian Svensson. They invited scores of people to the club’s dinners at the House of Prime Rib, and I spent many an evening congregating there with the friends of Carter Lipscomb. On Lipscomb’s Facebook page, former Iron Galaxies co-CEO Adam Boyes wrote of the post, “This is the greatest Carter post he never wrote. I loved him so much, and we were all so lucky to have met him and for him to have blessed our lives. R.I.P. BROTHER!” The cause of death wasn’t disclosed, but Lipscomb had a history of heart disease. He collapsed during a run some years ago and was resuscitated by a good Samaritan who knew CPR. There was an outpouring of game community support at the time. Simon Jeffery, former head of Sega of America, wrote, “There can be very few, if any, who in this business have befriended and been loved back by more people, than Carter. Whether it be humorous Carter or serious Carter, he, across decades, has been a positive force of nature for the games industry. When you heard his big Carter voice when you walked into a party or gathering, that’s where you would head. Rest in Peace you incredible man. The industry will never know your like again, and is a sadder, emptier place because of it.” Game veteran Michael Chang wrote, “Carter – The gentleman, the myth, the legend. Such tremendous warmth, enthusiasm and passion. You will be missed.” Shawn Layden, former chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios, said in a message, “The one person in gaming everyone loved.” Tammy McDonald, another game industry veteran, said in a message,”Carter was the glue for our weekly Covid cocktail gatherings. He went out of his way to be there for me when Matt passed away…. He was always heart and was the very definition of a ‘work family.'” There were scores of similar posts within an hour of the posting. After Lipscomb passed away, his family made a post on his Facebook page. Here’s the post: HEY FABULOUS PEOPLE!!!Well, it looks like I’ve leveled up to the ultimate gaming arena into the beyond. Let’s celebrate the incredible journey we’ve had together! For the past 30 years, I’ve been part of an epic video games fam, which has been nothing short of a wild, exhilarating and fun ride. From amazing game launches to unforgettable, trend setting industry experiences, we’ve made every moment count. Whether you knew me as “Doctor Business,” “The Boss of the Special Sauce,” or just a “brother from another mother”, I truly cherished every experience we’ve shared and every laugh we’ve had. Because of each of you, I’ve been blessed to be on this journey with you! Y’all know my catchphrases, and they still hold true: “Teamwork makin’ the dream work”, “What’s Tony spelled backwards? Why Not?” Life’s too short to hesitate, so keep embracing every opportunity. And remember, “You don’t have to get ready if you stay ready.” Always be prepared for the next adventure.A lot of you know I’ve been on an extraordinary fitness journey, and I had just finished an evening jog with Mrs. Jones when we arrived at home. Fitbit had me in the zone hitting all my metrics. Unfortunately, I “fell out” for the last time even though I was healthy and everything was goin’ great. I guess it was my time to go. Luckily, I was blessed to have my family nearby. My family knows that if this ever happened, then to write this note on my behalf and keep it light and keep it real but keep it real light. I hope they did right by me. Bye for now,¡Carter!P.S. Stay tuned for a Celebration of Life F-I-E-S-T-A! Only party clothes allowed!
