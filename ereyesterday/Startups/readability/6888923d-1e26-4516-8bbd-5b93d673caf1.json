  "text": "What is the tie that binds a business preparing for a corporate anniversary, navigating a merger, or responding to a fast-moving wildfire? It’s organized, accessible records. Sadly, though, the value of these files is often only revealed in high-pressure moments when instant access is essential for a successful outcome.These moments are rarely the time to get your house in order. However, consider the possibility when organizations invest properly in their future.The Getty: A case studyConsider the J. Paul Getty Trust which owns and operates the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. When ferocious wildfires threatened the region earlier this year, Getty didn’t scramble—it followed a well-rehearsed plan. The campus was designed with fire resistance in mind, and emergency protocols were firmly in place. But preparedness didn’t stop with the physical collection.Since 2001, the Getty Trust has operated an integrated archives and records management program, recognizing that preserving institutional knowledge is as vital as preserving art. From conservation research to acquisitions and construction records, Getty’s information assets are centralized, digitized, and accessible across departments. This approach powers daily operations, informs strategy, and enables clear storytelling.It also supports rapid response in a crisis. Part of the reason the Getty staff was able to ward off the physical threat to their property was that they knew that other critical intellectual property was already safely stored in digital channels.Moments of urgency (whether celebratory or stressful) demand quick decisions and confident communication. Strengths that are only possible when strong processes and deep organization underpin the organization. Yet many businesses find themselves unprepared, with essential knowledge scattered across filing cabinets, hard drives, outdated systems, or lost tacit knowledge due to employee turnover.That’s where records-readiness comes in. Organizations must recognize that records aren’t just for safekeeping or storage. They must make a point to assess what they have regularly, identify what matters, and transform static files into searchable, strategic tools. Because when records are organized and digitized, they become more than a compliance checkbox—they become an engine for resilience and growth.Don’t believe me? Here are three examples of how this can play out in the real world: Compliance under pressure Imagine your multinational company just received a surprise audit request from a federal agency regarding its environmental practices in five different jurisdictions. Thanks to a centralized digital records system, however, you’re able to respond to the inquiry within 48 hours—avoiding penalties and demonstrating a clear culture of transparency in the process. Would you say this was a result of luck or the outcome of a clear classification plan and a compliance-ready infrastructure? Mergers without mayhem Assume a regional health network is preparing to merge with a larger hospital system. It’s a story that commonly plays out in the pages of our local newspapers but often fails to mention the many thousands of pages of HR, vendor, and patient documentation spread across departments and outdated systems. By assessing records in advance—determining what is vital, what can be digitized, and what can be securely discarded—teams can streamline due diligence and minimize integration friction. All leading to cleaner, faster mergers with no unnecessary surprises and a more straightforward path to bottom-line results. Operational efficiency and emergency response Consider a local metropolitan transit authority. It oversees thousands of miles of underground infrastructure critical to the surrounding metro region. However, many of its engineering drawings and system maps—essential for maintenance, planning, and crisis response—are stored on aging microfilm and paper. The example I share here is not hypothetical. It was real, and our team, along with its partners, digitized and indexed more than 20 million legacy documents. Now, teams can retrieve essential information in seconds, not days, strengthening both daily operations and long-term planning.Invest in records-readinessThe lesson? Whether you’re facing an audit, a flood, or a facility move—or even celebrating a hundredth anniversary —having the correct information at your fingertips means you’re never starting from scratch. The investment yields a significant and tangible return, not just in these unique events but every single day.When you know what you have, where to find it, and how to use it, you’re doing more than just protecting your organization. You’re powering its future.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, July 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
