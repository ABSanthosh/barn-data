According to Indeed estimates, obtaining a commercial pilot's license takes anywhere from $55,000 to $100,000.The second best-paid job on Final Round AI's list is a dental hygienist. Even though only 12.63% of dental hygienist jobs ask for a degree in their job postings, New York State requires a high school diploma in addition to the completion of a dental hygiene licensure program accredited by the American Dental Association. State requirements can vary depending on the profession. So though the high-paying jobs on this list don't explicitly require a college degree in many of their job postings, they may still have unwritten time and money-intensive requirements to meet.Related: Looking for a Remote Job?
