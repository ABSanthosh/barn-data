The AI adapts to different art styles and scenes.The output is fully interactive, so viewers can view the 3D scenes as if they were inside them with a movable camera. They can zoom in and out and move around the space.

This will change how we make movies, games, simulators, and other digital manifestations of our physical world.\" — World Labs (@theworldlabs) December 2, 2024While World Labs isn't the first to explore this area, it is the first to make its 3D worlds explorable, per TechCrunch. Viewers can interact with the AI-created scenes on the World Labs website from within a web browser. In one demonstration, World Labs brings viewers into the 1942 painting Nighthawks by Edward Hopper. With a few clicks, viewers can freely move within the world created by the painting.We also had some fun peeking into the worlds behind a few creative masterpieces, like the neighborhood surrounding the diner in Edward Hopper's iconic painting Nighthawks.6/n pic.twitter.com/QSTDnZfkwb— World Labs (@theworldlabs) December 2, 2024The painting Nighthawks by Edward Hopper.

The company hopes to have its first product ready sometime next year.Related: I Tried 3 AI Headshot Generators and There Was a Clear Winner",
