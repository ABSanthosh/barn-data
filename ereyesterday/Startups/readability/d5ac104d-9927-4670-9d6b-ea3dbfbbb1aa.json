Since then, the stock has climbed back up, growing over 188% year-to-date at the time of writing.Related: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Says Nuclear Energy 'Is a Wonderful Way Forward' to Keep AI Data Centers RunningHuang has previously said that intense demand was the one thing that kept him up at night and that everyone wanted to be the first to use the Blackwell chip.\"We have a lot of people on our shoulders, and everybody is counting on us,\" he said last month.Snags in Blackwell production affect some of the world's biggest tech companies, which are Nvidia's biggest customers. Over 40% of Nvidia's revenue comes from just four clients: Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.Related: Here's How the CEOs of Salesforce and Nvidia Use ChatGPT in Their Daily Lives",
