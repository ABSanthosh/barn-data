  "text": "Bill Winters, the CEO of 160-year-old bank Standard Chartered, says that the MBA he earned from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business was a \"waste of time\" — but the humanities undergraduate degree he received from Colgate University was more worth it.In an interview that aired earlier this week, Bloomberg's Francine Lacqua asked Winters, 63, what he would recommend for young people to study. Winters responded by saying that he studied international relations and history as an undergraduate, graduating in 1983. He recommended those fields, stating that majoring in those areas taught him \"how to think.\"But his MBA from Wharton in 1988 was unnecessary, he said. \"I got an MBA later, but that was a waste of time,\" Winters told Bloomberg. \"I learned how to think at university. For the 40 years since I left university, those skills have been degraded, degraded, degraded.\"Related: Goldman Sachs CIO Says Coders Should Take Philosophy Classes — Here's Why Winters explained that critical thinking skills are \"coming back\" and becoming more important in the workforce now because AI is taking over tasks on the technical side.\"I really think in the age of AI that it's critical that you know how to think and communicate,\" Winters said.He clarified that communication doesn't mean to act like ChatGPT and churn out answers, but to know an audience and anticipate their needs with curiosity and empathy. Technical skills are being needed \"less and less,\" Winters said.Bill Winters.
