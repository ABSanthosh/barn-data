  "text": "October 12, 2024 10:00 AM Crystal Dynamics and Aspyr announced today that they’re launching another Tomb Raider collection: Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered, which launches on PC and consoles on February 14, 2025. This means we’re going to get another edition of the Tomb Raider series’ red-headed stepchild of a game, Angel of Darkness, which one would hope is in a marginally better state than it was when it originally launched. This marks the third Lara Croft-based collection in as many years, starting with the Switch’s Lara Croft Collection in 2023. Previously, the franchise had gone quiet since 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider, but this is an opportune moment to remind audiences about the history: Not only has Netflix just launched its new series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft, but Amazon is also working on a new film as well as a new game. While 5 years might not seem to be a long time, any chance to remind youthful audiences — those too young to have played the Tomb Raider games when they originally launched — of exactly who Lara Croft is and why she’s been an icon for as long as she has is one Amazon (and Netflix) should seize. To that end, it’s perhaps no surprise that the revival of her flagship franchise begins with a history lesson. In the same breath as it announced the new remastered collection, Crystal Dynamics also revealed that the Tomb Raider franchise has sold over 100 million units in the 25 years it has existed. They also highlighted several Lara Croft crossovers, such as her appearances in Brawlhalla, Dead by Daylight and Rainbow Six Siege. In personal news, I’m sating my need for RPGs by playing Metaphor: ReFantazio this weekend, the new Atlus title making waves and (so the little birds tell me) putting itself forward as a late Game of the Year contender. During my breaks, I’ll likely continue playing the new Silent Hill 2 Remake — and speaking of franchise revivals, there’s another one that deserves another shot at a comeback.
