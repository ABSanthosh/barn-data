Reddit struck a $60 million licensing deal with Google in February 2024, which allowed Google to train its Gemini AI on Reddit data. Reddit inked a similar contract with OpenAI in May 2024, so the ChatGPT-maker can refine its AI models from Reddit posts. In the lawsuit against Anthropic, Reddit wrote that OpenAI and Google \"are permitted to use public Reddit content but only after agreeing to Reddit's licensing terms,\" which include provisions to protect user privacy. Anthropic has not agreed to any terms and is using the site's data without permission, Reddit claims.Related: The Reddit Co-Founders Faced a Transformative Rejection in College — Here's How They Bounced Back to Start a $6.5 Billion BusinessReddit has over 100 million daily active users across hundreds of thousands of subreddit communities, per the complaint.
