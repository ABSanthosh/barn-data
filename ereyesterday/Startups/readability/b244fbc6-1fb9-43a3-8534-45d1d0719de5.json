  "text": "The “one more thing” revealed at this year’s Summer Game Fest was a teaser trailer for the latest game in the Resident Evil series — Resident Evil 9, or Resident Evil: Requiem. The trailer drops a few details about the game’s characters and setting, including that the series will apparently return to the ill-fated Raccoon City, as the gutted remains of its police station make an appearance in the trailer. The game is set to launch on February 27, 2026. Capcom and series producer Jun Takeuchi initially said that the next game in the series would need more time to be revealed — but “more time” apparently meant only 20 more minutes, as the reveal trailer dropped at the end of the show. The cinematic trailer follows an FBI agent named Grace, who’s investigating a series of mysterious deaths, including her mother’s — her mother being Resident Evil Outbreak’s red-suited reporter, Alyssa Ashcroft. The trailer doesn’t reveal much else, except the game’s release date and that it launches on PC and consoles, and that it is a single-player game. It also includes more visuals showing what’s left of Raccoon City after it was nuked at the end of Resident Evil 3. The series has thus far not returned to the zombified town outside of remakes and remixes of games Resident Evils 1-3.",
