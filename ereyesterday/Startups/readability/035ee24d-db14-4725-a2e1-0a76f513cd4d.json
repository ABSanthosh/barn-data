  "text": "Starting your own company is a giant leap and comes down to two things: your risk tolerance and your passion.  Risk tolerance is a mindset. And there is a wide range of perspectives on this topic. Similar to Mark Zuckerberg, I believe the “biggest risk is not taking one.” Most entrepreneurs try to mitigate risk as much as possible before taking the big leap. The lesser risk-tolerant the founder is, the more they will syndicate their risk, meaning they share the burden with cofounders or raise funds from friends and family to mitigate a significant, personal financial burden. The role of risk tolerance When we started Palmetto, my cofounder and I thought we had it all figured out. We did everything that any inaugural founder does: We wrote multiple business plans (a waste of time), built our financial and operating models, and built our client value offering. We had high risk tolerance but wanted to know all the blind spots before leaping. Despite our best-laid plans, nothing went as intended the first few months. We had a false start with our original investor (long story) and as a result, funded the company with whatever cash we had in our bank accounts. We found a hot desk at an architectural studio in the basement of a pub; it wasn’t exactly the type of place we wanted to showcase to our clients. Nonetheless, we had the ambition and motivation to continue. Clients didn’t come that quickly for us. Our “product-market fit” stage took much longer than we expected; we started doing non-core things to pay the bills, which was distracting. Time was a ticking bomb; we had no money to make it without income. This created undue stress on us and, importantly, our spouses. What we didn’t know then was the impact it would have on our families—specifically our respective partners. After a couple of years, my cofounder resigned for these reasons: the 100+ hour work weeks, travel, and relocation to another country. Ultimately, we had different interpretations of risk tolerance —I was willing to take risks for a lot longer while he sought a shorter horizon for a successful outcome. It’s more likely than not that your endeavor won’t be the success you think it will be. Are you the type of person who can sustain headwinds for a long time? Can you sign up for that type of risk?  The role of passion One of my favorite entrepreneurs, Mark Cuban, once said, “don’t follow your passion,” instead, focus on making money. It hurt my soul to hear that advice shared with founders. It’s important to remember that the horizon for success can be very long. You’ll likely need your “why” and deep conviction to keep going when times get hard. That’s especially true if the hard times last for long periods.  Building Palmetto has been one of the greatest joys of my life, but it came with many hardships and stress; as time evolved, the level and intensity of conflict rose to levels that I could have never fathomed. Survive the bumps in the road with passion While there are a lot of examples to share, one illustration does come to mind from the early days. My cofounder and I started the business on the basis that we would be able to secure funding (as previously referenced, we had a failed financing). We had secured a term sheet with an investor who operated a family office in London. He wrote us a term sheet for 1,000,000 GBP (in those days, that was equivalent to $2,000,000); it was enough money to kickstart our company and fund initial projects/initiatives.  After signing the term sheet, we made some business decisions that created liabilities for our organization, such as signing rental contracts and hiring the wrong vendors for long-term contracts. In retrospect, these were novice mistakes.  After signing the term sheet, the investor went AWOL. At first we assumed the best intent — perhaps he was ill? Or worse? He refused to reply to emails, answer our calls, or answer his office door. It was wild. Why would he operate like that? He had nothing to gain. Nonetheless, to this day, we still don’t know. I can say that the next several years were brutal; we didn’t have a salary (hard to do in an expensive place like London), we couldn’t travel (or if we did, we crashed at friends-of-friends’ homes), and market opportunity was passing us by, which created a lot of angst.  I lost my cofounder to another opportunity during that period, but I stayed the course. It was challenging, but my “why” and conviction around our mission kept me going. Had we started something I wasn’t passionate about, I would’ve quit long ago. If you aren’t passionate about what you’re doing as a founder, you’ll join the 90 percent of startups that don’t make it.  Final thoughts My advice is first to assess your “why” to truly understand your passion for your new venture and make sure it genuinely excites you; if it doesn’t, are there conditions that make it more exciting? What else needs to be included as part of the opportunity to make it inspirational to you, personally? Second, list a range of scenarios (e.g., how long will you invest your time, money, and opportunity costs) and then stack rank them from the most probable outcome to the least, and sit with it for a while. Think about whether will that work for you, your family, and your business partners before taking the leap.",
