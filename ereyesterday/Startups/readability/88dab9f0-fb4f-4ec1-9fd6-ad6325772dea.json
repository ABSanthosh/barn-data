Great speakers make it look easy because they put in the effort.Sahil Bloom, an entrepreneur and content creator, is one such speaker. In his new book, The 5 Types of Wealth (Ballantine Books, 2025), Bloom acknowledges that going from investment manager to content creator required strengthening his writing and public speaking skills.Bloom’s efforts paid off. Several million followers consume Bloom’s content across platforms, from LinkedIn to Instagram. Bloom’s newsletter, “The Curiosity Chronicle,” reaches hundreds of thousands of readers.Bloom is known for simplifying complex ideas. His speaking style is confident, concise, and charismatic. But make no mistake—he put in the work.“I used to be a nervous public speaker,” Bloom told me in a recent conversation. “I grew in confidence by putting in the reps, by putting myself in uncomfortable positions that forced me to grow.”Put in the reps. Like muscles, public speaking skills can grow stronger through repetition. The more you do it—the more you put yourself in situations that call for speaking in front of an audience—the better you’ll get. According to Bloom, the effort is worth it.  “Confident public speaking is a critical skill for many careers,” he says. “It expands potential relationship circles and builds authority and expertise. You can’t just hide from it—you need a set of strategies to increase your confidence and perform as the best version of yourself.”Bloom offers several strategies public speaking strategies in his book, covering everything from building the presentation to building your confidence when you’re on stage. As a storytelling coach, I find Bloom’s “pre-event preparation” tips to be especially valuable.1. Create clear structure“The best public speakers don’t deliver a speech—they tell a story. They take the audience on a journey,” says Bloom.He’s absolutely right. Too many speakers start their presentations by opening PowerPoint. There’s nothing wrong with using slides. There’s something wrong with designing slides before you have an outline or a structure.A clear structure is more than a beginning, middle, and end. As Bloom suggested, it is a journey. I recommend following the classic three-act structure for its simplicity.Imagine you’re pitching or selling a product/service to a potential customer. A three-act structure would look like this: Act 1: Status quo. Describe the customer’s current world. Act 2: Conflict. Unveil the problem the customer faces if they continue to do things the same way and become comfortable with the status quo. Act 3: Resolution. Introduce your product and clearly explain its benefits and how it will resolve the customer’s problem. Once the structure is in place, you can design slides to complement the story.2. Build your Lego blocksOnce you’ve built your presentation, it’s time to deliver it. Bloom offers a great tip for building your confidence before taking the stage: Don’t try to memorize everything.“When you’re nervous about a speech, toast, presentation, or talk, your natural bias is to memorize the content word for word…Unfortunately, I have found (and observed) that memorization often has the opposite effect. When you memorize material, one tiny slip-up can throw you off.”Bloom recommends a tactic he calls “build your Lego blocks.” Instead of memorizing every line—and risking that it all falls apart when you forget something—break your presentation into blocks or sections. Each block represents key moments like the opening, transitions, and conclusion.Put more effort (practice time) into these blocks and remain flexible for the rest of the presentation.3. Study the bestBloom has a growth mindset, so he recommends that building any skill requires constant and never-ending curiosity.“If you want to improve at anything, study the best practitioners of it. We live in an incredible era with access to the best speaking coaches in the world at the click of a button,” says Bloom. Bloom and I both agree that this is the golden age of learning, especially skills like public speaking. You can identify and follow great speakers on platforms such as TED.com or YouTube.Bloom recommends that, as you watch speakers, you pay attention to structure, delivery, pacing, gestures, and body movement.  Pay attention to the best, and you’ll adopt their best traits.“Lean into public speaking,” says Bloom. “It’s a valuable skill for building authority.”The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
