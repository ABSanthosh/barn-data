  "description": "SummaryIn this week’s episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Daniel Koonce, Caleb Talley, and Jeff Amerine dive deep into the topics of screen time, digital distraction, and addictive technologies with Ian McCready, founder of selfctrl. Ian’s journey is as relatable as it is eye-opening—once addicted to video games himself, he now leads a nonprofit aimed at helping kids and parents reclaim their time and mental wellbeing in the age of endless scrolling and instant dopamine hits.Through candid stories, Ian shares how recognizing the negative impact of his gaming habit (sometimes up to 14 hours a day in college) prompted a complete lifestyle shift. He ultimately launched selfctrl, dedicated to equipping both youth and adults with the skills and frameworks to develop healthier relationships with screens. From school assemblies to workshops for parents, Ian and his team offer practical, actionable steps for families feeling overwhelmed by technology.What’s striking is the universality of the challenge. Ian highlights stories ranging from elementary-age children struggling to put down YouTube to adults admitting addiction to mobile games and social media. Listeners will find both comfort and motivation in Ian’s advice: set limits, seek real-life community, and be transparent about struggles. The conversation concludes with a powerful reminder about the value of relationships and human connection, something screens can't replace.
