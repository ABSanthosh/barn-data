  "text": "Riot Games announced today that it has hired Hoby Darling to fill the spot of its President, following current CEO A. Dylan Jadeja shifting positions in 2023. Darling previously worked at companies such as Nike, Skullcandy and Volcom, and was a member of Logitech’s senior executive team. He joins the company and begins his role effective immediately. As Riot’s president, Darling’s role will be to communicate with various teams within Riot to assist in their ongoing projects. His previous credentials include building out Astro Gaming as CEO of Skullcandy, and creating a division within Logitech serving esports athletes and creators while part of that company’s global executive team. Hoby Darling joins Riot Games as its new President. Darling said in a statement, “The first time I walked into Riot, I felt a scrappy, soulful, and courageous energy I knew I needed to be a part of. I’ve worked with a lot of companies, and there’s something special about a place that takes risks, challenges convention, and stays fiercely committed to its mission. Riot has a long history of creating experiences that truly matter to players, and I couldn’t be more excited to work alongside passionate Rioters who push each other to do their best work every day.” Jadeja added in a separate statement, “Hoby has spent his career at companies that serve the most passionate communities there are, from sports to gaming and beyond. He knows how to bring out the best in teams, and he’ll help Rioters tap into their creativity, sharpen their focus, and channel their competitive fire. Most importantly, he understands the importance of nurturing our creative heart and will challenge us to keep raising the bar for each other and for players.” Jadeja took over the CEO role at Riot Games in 2023.",
