It is estimated that tourism accounts for eight per cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, while transportation is responsible for around a quarter of global CO2 emissions. Grounded, a Detroit-based startup, is tackling this challenge with an innovative modular design for electric vehicles. Grounded’s system offers a Lego-like, modular approach to vehicle customisation. Originally designed for the RV market, the technology allows businesses in diverse industries – such as logistics, mobile healthcare, and food transport – to quickly adapt EVs to meet specific needs. The vehicles are assembled at Grounded’s 13,000-square-foot facility in Detroit and are already in trials, including a delivery van for a logistics startup in Brooklyn and a medical support van for the Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition in Honolulu. What sets Grounded apart is its focus on scalability through modularity. Unlike traditional aftermarket upfitting, which can be costly and fragmented, Grounded’s system simplifies the process by offering interchangeable components, including kitchen, bed, storage, and dedicated logistics modules. CEO and Founder Sam Shapiro, an ex-SpaceX engineer, explains, “We are electrifying the $70 billion global RV industry as well as commercial vehicle markets through our manufacturing technology and modular design system, which also allows us to offer customisation at scale.” This flexibility allows the company to serve a broad range of sectors while maintaining sustainability and cost-efficiency. Grounded is also backed by strong venture capital support, with investors citing the team’s exceptional engineering culture as a key strength. “We believe the world would be a better place if people had the freedom and self-reliance to live, work and explore anywhere, sustainably integrated within nature,” Shapiro told Springwise. The startup’s ability to pivot from recreational vehicles to commercial fleets highlights its adaptability and innovative edge. Currently, the company is expanding its product line and recently announced a new mobile home trike model, called the Grounded T1 micro-camper. With its modular approach, Grounded could play a pivotal role in enabling small businesses and solo adventurers to adopt sustainable practices while reducing their environmental impact.
