  "text": "Signals were mixed for electric vehicles as major U.S. automakers reported earnings under pressure from Trump Administration threats to revoke EV tax incentives.Ford Motor Company reported a $5.1 billion loss in 2024 for its EV segment, Ford Model e, when it reported earnings Wednesday. The company also forecasted as much as a $5.5 billion loss in 2025, despite anticipating profitability for the company as a whole in the coming year. Executives at rival GM, meanwhile, which does not break out numbers for its EV segment, suggested that revenue from EVs in 2024 outpaced labor and materials costs, according to Reuters.“The transition to electric vehicles is really expensive. We’ve seen Ford and GM and others invest quite a bit of money in the designs and manufacturing supply chain to be able to produce EVs,” says K.C. Boyce, a vice president in the automotive and mobility industry and energy industry practices at Escalent. “Given that expense, it’s really important to get to volume as quickly as possible.”Crucially, GM, which claims the Cadillac, Chevrolet, Buick, and GMC brands, eclipsed Ford EV sales throughout the year, selling more than 114,000 EVs compared to Ford’s 97,865, according to Kelley Blue Book and Electrek. That achievement puts GM second in line to Tesla, which sold a whopping 633,762 EVs in 2024, but has seen its market share gradually slip as its product line ages and rivals release a wider variety of competitive vehicles. The EV-maker, helmed by Elon Musk, reported earnings late last month that confirmed its first annual sales drop in company history, as well as quarterly revenue that came in below expectations, CNN reported.On the whole in the U.S., EV sales set a new record of 1.3 million in 2024, up by about 7.3 percent from the roughly 1.2 million sold in 2023, Kelley Blue Book reported. Last year’s sales were boosted by a 15.2 percent year-over-year spike in the fourth quarter, a trend Boyce says likely continued into January in spite of threats by President Donald Trump that he would roll back EV tax incentives.“I think in part, it is a reflection of the roughly 40 percent of consumers who say that they’d be likely to hold off on buying an EV until the right one is available to them,” Boyce says. “They’re looking at the landscape and saying, ‘If the $7,500 tax credit goes away, that’s going to be a big deal for me. I might as well go ahead and pull the trigger now.’”The new administration has injected considerable uncertainty into the EV industry. Certain scenarios, like one in which the price of gas significantly rises, could push consumers toward EVs, although policies or macroeconomic conditions that precipitate tumbling gas prices could have the opposite effect, according to Boyce. “When we look at the market, overall, price has become a much more important factor to buyers,” he says, adding that rolling back tax credits, levying tariffs, and decreasing spending on charging infrastructure would also likely influence consumer sentiment toward EVs.But like other experts in the space, Boyce anticipates the current administration’s actions likely won’t derail—but could considerably impact—the speed of EV adoption.“We are definitely on a trajectory to electrify a substantial portion of our light duty fleet, at least, and the real question is the pace at which that’s going to happen,” Boyce says. “It’s a combination of things that’s really driving that.”",
