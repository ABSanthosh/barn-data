Here’s a limited-time offer for buy one, get one free (BOGO) tickets for the event. We’re returning to Los Angeles, the No. 1 city in the world for game jobs, at a time when the industry has had a tough time, as chronicled by observers like Matthew Ball. The industry went through 30 months of layoffs and studio closures, with daylight finally arriving in January when hiring started catching up with firing at game companies (per Amir Satvat‘s data). And just as things were looking up, we’ve got a self-inflicted tariff war and stock market crash — just in time to throw doubt into Nintendo’s Switch 2 launch. Amir Satvat receives Game Changers Award at The Game Awards 2024. Our hope is that the game industry will find its way back to growth, and we’ve collected some great minds to speak about the issues before us. How do we navigate our way back to balanced growth with better revenues, more jobs and continuous innovation? We will cover topics including monetizing retention, AI tools, evolving live services, mental health in games, motion gaming’s evolution, listening to players, ad-supported cloud gaming, ageism in gaming, maintaining thriving game communities, raising money, investing in games, mobile gaming strategy, political/issue games and of course the state of games in various sessions. And we will have our latest Women in Gaming Breakfast (moderated by Rachel Kaser of GamesBeat) and our first Accessibility in Gaming lunch. Here’s a whole bunch of our speakers for our 2025 flagship event, and there’s more on the way.
