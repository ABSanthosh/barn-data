Meanwhile, two out of three executives surveyed said generative AI adoption has led to division between teams, while almost half (42%) reported that adopting AI \"is tearing their company apart.\"\"Generative AI holds transformative potential for the enterprise, but it can also create deep rifts within organizations that rely on a patchwork of point solutions or IT-built applications developed in a silo,\" said May Habib, CEO and co-founder at Writer, in a statement.Still, the survey also found that a majority of employees (at least 9 out of 10) were optimistic about their company's approach to generative AI — and they're even paying for it on their own. More than one-third of employees (35%) said they pay out-of-pocket for AI tools.Related: No Meetings, Up to $30 Per Hour, Fully Remote: A College Student Training AI Says the Work Is 'Perfect' for Introverts The majority of employees surveyed (81%) and almost all of the C-suite (97%) said if they were looking for a new position, finding a company that uses generative AI is important.\"The companies who will lead in the next era of AI adoption are the ones putting the right processes and systems in place today,\" said Dan Schawbel, managing partner, at Workplace Intelligence. \"They're prioritizing their change management efforts, cultivating support for AI among their people, and ensuring they're making the right investment in AI tools.\"To combat the divisions, Habib suggests adopting a clear, organization-wide approach to AI in the workplace and also choosing a vendor that can provide training to show the best use cases (and embolden employees to use it).View the full report, here.Related: The CEO of $61 Billion Anthropic Says AI Will Take Over a Crucial Part of Software Engineers' Jobs Within a Year",
