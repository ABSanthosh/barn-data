  "text": "The Macy’s C-Suite may not have a lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving. The week leading up to Black Friday was always going to be a stressful one for the department store chain—but on top of everything else, company leadership is now dealing with more than $100 million in misreported expenses, delaying the planned release of their third quarter earnings report.While preparing its unaudited third quarter financial statements, the company “identified an issue related to delivery expenses in one of its accrual accounts,” Macy’s disclosed on Monday. An independent investigation helped reveal that, between late 2021 through to this month, “a single employee with responsibility for small package delivery expense accounting intentionally made erroneous accounting accrual entries to hide approximately $132 to $154 million of cumulative delivery expenses.”The missing money reportedly had no impact on the company’s cash management or vendor payments, and it’s not clear what the perpetrator–who is no longer employed by Macy’s–stood to gain. Still, it’s the last problem a business owner wants to be staring down, especially at the start of a busy holiday season. How can you avoid the same pitfalls?Jay Jung, founder and managing partner at San Francisco-based corporate finance advisory firm Embarc Advisors (No. 477 on this year’s Inc. 5000 list) has some advice for founders.Account for everythingThe “tactical takeaway” from the Macy’s snafu, Jung says, “is to make sure you reconcile your balance sheet accounts.”It may sound obvious, but the Embarc Advisors founder tells Inc. that many entrepreneurs focus on their profits and losses (P\u0026L) but under-scrutinize their balance sheet accounts.“Conducting timely and thorough cash reconciliations with the bank account is a must,” he adds. “This prevents fraud.”Always ask questionsSiloization and delegation are important tools for managing a business, but Jung emphasizes that it’s important for management teams to understand trends “in other balance sheet accounts.”“It took three years for someone at Macy’s to ask, ‘What is going on with this accrual account?’” he says. $150 million missing over three years might not have stood out at such a big company, but “this is probably an accrual that just kept growing, which is how someone finally asked what it was, only to figure out it wasn’t real.”If someone had started asking those questions earlier on, the company might never have found itself in this mess.“Even if it was intentional from that employee,” Jung says, “it’s just an error that nobody else dug deeper.”Don’t rely on an auditGet audited—but, Jung says, don’t stop there.“Just because you have an audit done, does not mean all is well,” he explains. “We often see business owners rely on an audit as a validation that their business is fine. … It’s important that owners take ultimate ownership of their financials and understand ‘what is going on’ with their balance sheet and cash flow, not just the P\u0026L.”That’s especially true given that there is an ongoing shortage of accountants (the number of people taking the test to become a CPA was cut nearly in half between 1990 and 2021, per an industry professional organization). “If public companies like Macy’s [are] facing issues like this, we can only imagine the shortage of talent that SMBs are facing,” Jung says.Macy’s did release preliminary third quarter financial results today, which showed the overall company’s net sales declining by 2.4 percent despite growth at Macy’s “First 50 locations”—a subset of stores in diverse markets meant to pilot new strategies—as well as premium brands Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury.",
