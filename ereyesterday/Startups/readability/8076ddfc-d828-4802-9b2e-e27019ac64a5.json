  "text": "As recession concerns rise, consumers are cutting back but not necessarily cutting ties with the brands they love. In times of economic uncertainty, emotional connection becomes a key differentiator. Brands that understand what truly drives their audience—their values, aspirations, and identity—don’t just survive; they thrive. It’s no longer just about selling; it’s about resonating.Status: The Identity SignalWe often choose brands not for what they do but for what they say about us. These “look-at-me” brands—the car, the watch, the phone—that signal who we are or aspire to be. It’s not only about utility but about visibility.Take Apple. When someone pulls out the latest iPhone or MacBook, they’re not just accessing tech. They’re making a statement. Apple stands for cultural currency and innovation. That glowing logo? It’s shorthand for “I think differently.”Apple’s new AirPods 4 short film Someday, directed by Spike Jonze (Her, Where the Wild Things Are) and starring actor Pedro Pascal (The Last of Us, Gladiator II), reinforces the brand’s status. Way beyond a product demo, it’s a cinematic experience that positions AirPods as tools for emotional escape and self-expression. The metaphor of noise cancellation becomes a stand-in for reclaiming inner calm. The message? Apple doesn’t just make earbuds; it makes you feel cool, creative, and in control.Self-Confidence: Empowerment Through ExperienceBut Apple doesn’t stop at status. The brand also delivers emotional reassurance, especially in moments of vulnerability.Consider “Rick’s Rescue,” their new spot that recounts a real-life emergency: an Australian man swept out to sea uses his Apple Watch to call for help. More than a showcase of innovative features, it’s a story of survival. The product is functional as well as empowering. And in uncertain times, that kind of reassurance is priceless. Apple’s message is clear: We’ve got your back whether you’re creating something beautiful or facing a crisis.If a consumer seeks validation, reassurance, or a sense of control, Apple claims that space, too. In moments of crisis or everyday uncertainty, which we’re all feeling now, the brand presents itself as helpful, reliable, empowering, and even life-saving.Passions: Connecting to What People LoveApple is not the only brand riding the emotional wave, tapping into a community’s desire or motivational behavior.Robotic lawn mower company Husqvarna launched a wildly creative recruitment campaign to attract top tech talent to a small town in Sweden. Instead of touting specs, it tapped into a shared passion: gaming.Partnering with agency Weber Shandwick, Husqvarna reimagined its lawnmowers as programmable consoles for the classic video game Doom. Suddenly, a mower is more than a product—it is a playground for elite software engineers. The message? If you love to solve complex problems and build something meaningful, this is your kind of place.Husqvarna became more than a tool manufacturer by speaking to passion, not just practicality. It became a destination for driven tech talent.The Customer is the Hero“In recessionary times, the need for brand-level advertising is even greater,” Kerry McKibbin, president of ad agency Mischief USA, told media publication Ad Age.The same principle applies whether you’re Apple with a blockbuster budget or a small business: people stick with brands that make them feel something.Emotional advertising works best when the product isn’t the hero—the customer is. This means that the message’s focus should be on how the product or service helps the customer rather than on the features of the product itself. Apple doesn’t show off features; it shows how the product helps you stay strong, creative, or safe. The brand plays the role of a trusted companion, not a savior.That’s a lesson any business can apply to their customers’ lives, especially those with a front-row seat. Whether you’re a tech giant like Apple or a small business, you can use the principles of emotional advertising to connect with your customers. You may not have Spike Jonze on speed dial, but you have something as powerful: proximity. You hear your customers’ stories, see their preferences, and have the agility to respond with empathy and speed, no matter the scale.Use that.Action ItemsAsk yourself: Do your products or services make customers feel more confident, connected, or seen? Are you selling a product or service or offering a feeling of belonging, capability, or joy? Is your brand one people want to wear, share, or be part of, not just buy from?  Emotional relevance is your competitive edge. Brands that endure win hearts so they can win wallets. We buy them because we believe in them. We even love some of them. So before your next campaign or launch, don’t just ask what you’re selling. Ask what you’re saying—and how it makes people feel.Because in a shaky economy, the most potent currency is how you make people feel.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, May 2, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
