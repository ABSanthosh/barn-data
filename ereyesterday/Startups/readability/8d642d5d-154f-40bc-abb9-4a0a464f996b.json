  "text": "Searching for an energy boost recently, I found myself going down an inspiring, if slightly obsessive, rabbit hole on Inc.’s Female Founders 500. Page after page, story after story, I saw powerhouse women building million-dollar businesses in every industry imaginable. The key takeaway wasn’t that any one of them had some secret strategy I could swipe and use in my coaching and consulting business. Instead, it was as if they were all whispering through the screen: keep going. The state of women-owned businesses todayThat whisper echoed again as I read Wells Fargo’s The 2025 Impact of Women-Owned Businesses report. This isn’t just a collection of stats. It’s a blueprint of what’s possible when women step into their power as entrepreneurs and leaders. Right now, there are 272,567 women-owned businesses in the U.S. generating over $1 million in annual revenue. Together, they contribute $2.2 trillion to the economy and provide 9.4 million jobs. That’s not a niche. That’s a national growth engine. The number I had to read and reread was this one. They make up just 1.9 percent of all women-owned businesses. The climb to that milestone is steep. For many, it’s not a lack of talent or grit that holds them back. It’s a constraining mix of limited capital, systemic bias, and plain old self-doubt.  Still, these founders persist, and their stories reveal something crucial that every business leader should hear. Action unlocks everything These million-dollar businesses didn’t wait for perfect timing or a 10-point plan. They moved forward. During the pandemic, they pivoted to e-commerce or telehealth. When inflation rose, they tightened cash flow and stayed focused on customer needs. When access to capital was denied, they found another way that often meant tapping alternative financing or peer networks. They built momentum, not by scaling recklessly, but by making bold choices again and again. How female founders often lead  What really stands out isn’t just their resilience. It’s how they lead:  They adapt fast. These founders don’t romanticize old models—they test, pivot, and adjust.  They lead leanly. They build efficient, customer-obsessed teams, not bloated org charts.  They get creative with capital. Limited access didn’t stop them. It sharpened their focus.  They invest in relationships. Peer groups, mentors, and advisors aren’t optional—they’re essential.  They lead with purpose. These businesses aren’t just about profits. They’re building something that matters.  The numbers back this up. From 2019 to 2024, million-dollar women-owned firms grew seven times faster than men’s in number and three times faster in employment. They outperform expectations in spite of structural disadvantages. So, what’s the takeaway? For me, it’s this: You don’t need to know the whole path. You just need to take the next step. Too many leaders, like the midcareer professionals or founders I coach, stay stuck in overthinking. They wait for confidence, clarity, or perfect conditions. But what this report (and these incredible women) shows is that clarity comes from action. Not the other way around. It’s through movement, decisions, and real-world feedback that you figure it out. Your move. Here’s my challenge to you: What’s one bold action you’ve been waiting to take? What would happen if you just did it this week? Whether you’re leading a team, building a business, or deciding what’s next in your career, don’t wait for the fear to disappear. Don’t wait for the system to change. Don’t wait for someone to tell you that you’re ready. Keep going. Because momentum isn’t just nice-to-have. It’s your greatest competitive advantage. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc.
