  "text": "Nyakio Grieco, the co-founder and CEO of beauty retailer Thirteen Lune, has been accused of fraud and embezzlement, according to a civil lawsuit filed in a California superior court. Grieco founded the Los Angeles-based retailer in 2020 alongside Patrick Herning to spotlight and uplift inclusive beauty brands founded by Black and Brown entrepreneurs. Herning is reportedly no longer involved in the company. Grieco was named an Inc. Female Founders honoree in 2023 and 2024. In the lawsuit, venture capital firm Relevance Ventures—which invested about $3 million in Thirteen Lune last May—outlines 17 complaints against the retailer, including misappropriating company funds, aiding and abetting securities fraud, and breaching fiduciary duty. Grieco told journalist Kirbie Johnson, who first reported this story in her newsletter Ahead of the Kirb on Tuesday, that this lawsuit is “baseless.” The plaintiffs allege that Grieco embezzled at least $165,535.25 in company funds for personal and family expenses, spending more than $7,500 on Taylor Swift concert tickets, $20,000 on flights, $15,600 on a family vacation to Mexico, $13,000 on cellulite removal treatments, $8,700 on Amazon purchases, and $6,000 on a trip to Providence, Rhode Island, to “celebrate her daughter’s acceptance to Brown University.” When asked about this spending, Grieco told Johnson that she didn’t oversee “finances, financial expenses, or spending,” before Thirteen Lune’s recent acquisition by SNR Capital. All charges, she said, were approved by previous management. Plaintiffs also claim that Thirteen Lune completed this acquisition “for the purpose of wiping out [shareholder] equity.” They allege that Thirteen Lune’s net revenue “collapsed,” dropping from roughly $24 million in 2023 to $7 million in 2024. By December 2024, the company also had $5 million in debt, according to the complaint. Because of this, Grieco and other defendants sold Thirteen Lune through an assignment for the benefit of creditors (ABC), which is an alternative to bankruptcy. During this process, plaintiffs allege that Grieco misrepresented a post-ABC investment opportunity in order “to create a false $10 million valuation,” and concealed financial information from shareholders about the ABC in an effort to erase equity while defendants “acquired Thirteen Lune’s assets without any investment.” Grieco told Johnson her company’s recent restructuring “was properly handled from a statutory manner, with a third party fiduciary with the assets then purchased, voted on by with a majority vote to be able to take the company in the process by the former board and VCs.” Relevance Ventures, she said, did not participate when it was given the opportunity to vote. She added: “For an investor I did not know well to have access to bank documents [and to] obtain certain documents that no other LP or VC of our company has ever seen, to show up in a lawsuit by someone I barely know, I find shocking. It seems to me that for any management or VC not moving forward and a part of the new company comes off as sour grapes.” Thirteen Lune did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Inc. The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
