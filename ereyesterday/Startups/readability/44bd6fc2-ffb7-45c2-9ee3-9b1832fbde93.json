  "text": "Where do, not just big ideas, but million-dollar ideas come from? Some think that the million-dollar business idea is born in a lab after extensive testing, or from some late-night “eureka” moment. The truth? The truth is, million dollar ideas are often hiding in plain sight.  My own million-dollar business idea was one of those. About a decade ago, right when the “gig economy” was coming into its own, I noticed that while there were plenty of websites catering to small businesses. But none were focusing on the largest segment of the small business world, namely, the 80 percent of all small businesses that were one-person business: The solopreneur, the freelancer, the micro-business. Sensing opportunity, I teamed up with a company focused on that market and we built what would become an incredibly successful website for that market. TheSelfEmployed.com was a hit from the start, was around for about a decade, and had tons of big-name sponsors like Microsoft, Visa, Rocket Lawyer, and SCORE. A few years later, I sold it to Mark Cuban. And while I didn’t sell it for $1 million, it netted me $1 million in the time that I owned it. Lesson? The best big ideas are often the simplest, most obvious solutions to problems right under your nose. The real question is: Are you paying attention? Take Squatty Potty, for example. The Squatty Potty Phenomenon In 2011, Judy Edwards faced a serious digestive issue. After trying seemingly everything, a therapist suggested squatting while going to the bathroom might be the solution. Game to try anything, Judy tried it, but had a difficult time positioning herself correctly. That is, until her designer son Bobby built her a little stepstool on which to rest her feet in the proper position.  Voilà! Problem solved. Now here’s where it gets interesting. The stool worked so well that Bobby built several more and gave them away to friends and family. Everyone loved it. Seeing the obvious business potential, they went into production, built a website, and started selling their product online. Online sales were more than $1 million in year one. Squatty Potty was born.  Buzz built, and soon Howard Stern was extolling the virtues of the Squatty Potty on his show. But then the (and please pardon the expression, but it fits too perfectly not to use it) s*** hit the fan when Squatty Potty was picked to be on Shark Tank in Season 6.  Lori Grenier made a deal with the Edwards family, offering $350,000 for a 10 percent stake in the company. According to the company’s website, “sales after the show aired where the highest of any product in Shark Tank history, with $1 million in sales the first night and $3 million in the three weeks after the show aired.” Squatty Potty went on to become one of the most successful businesses in Shark Tank history, being acquired for $31 million in 2021. Lessons from Squatty Potty The success of the Squatty Potty is not just its design, it was in recognizing a universal problem and offering a solution that was simple and affordable.  That is the real secret to finding a million-dollar business idea: Solve the simple problems that no one else is tackling. How to find your big idea The good news is that you do not have to be a genius inventor to come up with a winning idea. You just need to be observant. Here are three steps to guide you: Start with problems: Reflect on your daily life. What annoys you? What could work better? Each inconvenience holds potential. For example, Jamie Siminoff invented the Ring video doorbell to see who was at his door while working in his garage. That simple fix became a billion-dollar business and, ironically, one that Shark Tank famously turned down. Listen to others: Ask friends, family, or customers about their frustrations. What are they struggling with? Often, the best ideas come from listening. Squatty Potty was invented because a son paid attention to his mom’s health struggles. Follow trends: Trends tell you where the zeitgeist is. Canva, for instance, came about because of the pain point of using complex design tools like Photoshop. Canva solved that problem. Think small, go big. Again, the best ideas are often deceptively simple: A sponge that changes texture based on water temperature (Scrub Daddy). Affordable razors delivered to your door (Dollar Shave Club). These are not groundbreaking innovations. They succeed because they solve practical, real-world problems. Your Squatty Potty, Scrub Daddy million-dollar idea need not be a far-off dream. It is likely sitting right in front of you, hiding in plain sight… disguised as a problem. So the next time something annoys you, do not just brush it off or ignore it. Instead, ask yourself:  Is this my million-dollar idea?
