  "text": "In a lengthy post on X today, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke said that all of the company’s employees must integrate AI into their jobs, and that using it will become a part of their performance reviews. That’s the overwhelming message from a memo that also mandates that AI be considered before any new requests for resources.  In the memo, Lütke revealed that he uses AI “all the time,” and has encouraged employees to develop their AI skills by also using the tech heavily. All Shopify employees have access to a suite of AI tools, including Microsoft’s Copilot, Anthropic’s Claude, and Cursor, but according to Lutke, not enough employees have taken advantage of the tech. To ensure Shopify doesn’t fall behind, Lütke is turning those suggestions to use AI into directives. Going forward, Lütke said, “Using AI effectively is now a fundamental expectation of everyone at Shopify.” He wrote that while employees are “welcome to try” opting out of AI, “I cannot see this working out today, and definitely not tomorrow. Stagnation is almost certain, and stagnation is slow-motion failure. If you’re not climbing, you’re sliding.”Lütke also said that AI will transform GSD, the company’s internal tool for tracking projects. GSD, which stands for “get shit done,” is used by Shopify’s internal teams to log the progress and status of every project. From now on, says Lütke, the prototype phase of all GSD projects “should be dominated by AI exploration.” Lütke said that GSD prototypes are “meant for learning and creating information,” and that “AI dramatically accelerates this process. You can learn to produce something that other team mates can look at, use, and reason about in a fraction of the time it used to take.” AI will also play a big role in determining headcount for teams. Before asking for more employees and resources, Lütke wrote, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Lütke suggested that Shopify managers ask themselves, “what would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?” Lütke said the question “can lead to really fun discussions and projects.” To further ensure that all employees are using AI as much as possible, Lütke said that Shopify “will add AI usage questions to our performance and peer review questionnaire.” Lütke didn’t give specifics regarding how impactful AI usage rates will be to employees’ performance review. Lütke, who cofounded Shopify in 2006, said he decided to post the memo, titled “Reflexive AI usage is now a baseline expectation at Shopify,” because it was “in the process of being leaked and (presumably) shown in bad faith.”The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
