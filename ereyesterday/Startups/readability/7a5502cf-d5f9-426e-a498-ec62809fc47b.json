  "text": "After months of speculation, President Donald Trump on Wednesday revealed his long awaited tariff strategy to restore manufacturing– but also one that threatens to stoke inflation at home and retaliation abroad. Trump doesn’t see it that way. “Taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years,” he said in his remarks. “But it is not going to happen anymore.” Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs against all the nations that levy duties against the U.S. But at half their rate, he announced during a so-called “Liberation Day” event at the White House Rose Garden. “April 2nd will forever be remembered as the day that American industry was reborn,” Trump said. Stock market futures nosedived on the news. While the president didn’t disclose the full calculus of the plan, he invited Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to hand off a chart during the announcement that compared foreign tariff rates to what the U.S. will begin charging.  China sits at the top of the list, with a 67 percent tariff. In return, the U.S. will now charge a reciprocal duty of 34 percent. Vietnam, which is listed as charging a 90 percent tariff, will now face one of 46 percent. The European Union, a leading U.S. trading partner, will face a 20 percent duty. Allies including South Korea and Japan will face rates of 25 percent and 24 percent respectively, while the United Kingdom–which doesn’t even have a trade deficit with the U.S.–will face a 10 percent rate.  “If you want your tariff rate to be zero, then you build your product in America,” Trump said during the event.  Trump revealed a 10 percent blanket tariff as well, which appears to be stacked atop the reciprocal tariff rates. That means Vietnam, a major exporter of footwear, could face a tariff rate of up to 56 percent. Your next pair of running shoes likely just went up in price. So how bad could this be for the economy? Maybe even worse than originally feared.  “The high costs of new tariffs threaten investment, jobs, supply chains and, in turn, America’s ability to outcompete other nations and lead as the preeminent manufacturing superpower, ” said Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, in a statement. The worst-case scenario outlined by the credit rating agency Moody’s– a 20 percent blanket tariff on all imports– estimated up to 5.5 million job losses. That could send the unemployment rate up to 7 percent, and cause the country’s GDP sink by 1.7 percent. But Wednesday’s rate announcement appears to be in excess of that. Small Business Majority in a statement said that the new tariffs “could spell doom for many small firms.” While Republican lawmakers–along with Cabinet members–appeared jovial during Wednesday’s event, Democratic lawmakers immediately started criticizing the measure. “The President is risking a recession with this national sales tax he calls tariffs—while needlessly alienating our closest allies,” Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said in a statement. “When American families see what this does to the price of goods, such as cars, groceries, and gas, it is going to create a negative economic force across this country and cost a lot of American jobs.” The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
