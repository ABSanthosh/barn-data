Spotted: Although the digital boom has encouraged a shift towards paperless, online platforms and publications, the paper industry continues to grow – largely helped by increasing demand for paper packaging. Although these products have environmental benefits compared to their plastic counterparts, forestry and paper production still play a big part in mass deforestation and land degradation. Now, one female-founded Ethiopian startup has an alternative. Zafree Papers was set up back in 2017 by Bethelhem (Betty) Dejene with a goal of producing tree-free paper made from agricultural waste that’s better for the planet. Millions of tonnes of banana ‘pseudo-stems’ – the trunk-like structure of overlapping leaf sheaths at the centre of the plants – go to waste after every harvest, either left to rot or be burnt. Instead, Zafree Papers cuts, soaks, and mixes these banana fibres to create a pulp. The pulp then undergoes a multi-step process involving washing, refining, drying, and pressing, before it can then be used to create a variety of eco-friendly paper products. Because the company does not bleach its pulp, the final materials are non-toxic and 100 per cent recyclable. The natural by-products Zafree’s process creates are turned into fertilisers that help small-scale farmers grow their crops more sustainably. Zafree Papers was selected to join the 100+ Accelerator for a pilot programme with AB InBev Brewing Group’s Hansa Beer. As part of the pilot, Zafree transformed organic waste into new, corrugated boxes to package Hansa Beer products. Earlier this year, Dejene was also named the regional winner of Founder of the Year at the Eastern Africa Startup Awards.
