  "text": "Many people and businesses today approach artificial intelligence as an autonomous magical solution for creating marketing campaigns or new products. AI is incredible and useful, yet it isn’t magic.  It is a tool, and in some cases today, a tool that sometimes lies or hallucinates. Think of your teenage years when you thought you knew it all, told some fibs, and allegedly may have experimented with substances for “research purposes.”  If you aren’t careful, using AI could cause irreparable damage to your reputation as well as legal challenges. Fortunately, this risk can be mitigated if you are prepared. One important area of law your business should be concerned with is the creation of IP, or intellectual property—either from entirely original prompts or modifying existing IP. As generative AI systems become increasingly autonomous in crafting creative works, inventing new technologies, and solving complex problems, one question stands out: Who owns what AI creates? As a talent agency executive charged with marketing and business affairs, a media/IP attorney, and a professor of law at USC Gould School of Law, I grapple every day with the use of AI in business, plus the creation, modification, and monitoring of intellectual property. Copyright and intellectual property Traditional IP law is premised on the concept of human authorship or inventorship.  So, who is the author when a genAI computer is involved? Is it the company that created the AI, the user who inputs the prompts, the owners of the content the computer was trained on, or the AI itself? Or maybe all of them? In 2022, the U.S. Copyright Office denied copyright protection for an artwork created solely by AI, citing a human authorship requirement. Similarly, in patent law, most jurisdictions require that inventors be natural persons, leaving inventions created autonomously by AI in a legal gray area. While the ruling hasn’t settled the issue, there are things you can do to prepare and protect yourself in these uncharted waters. Here’s how you can prepare for genAI compliance. 1. Read the fine print for large language models and other genAI. Read the license and purchase agreement for using the genAI software. Are there any restrictions on ownership, disclaimers, or limitations of liability that could come back to haunt your company? 2. Research the training data. What data was used to train the AI? Find out if the AI was trained on copyrighted data, images, video, etc. Avoid intellectual property issues before they start. 3. Build your own LLM. Many businesses are creating their own LLMs that are trained on their own company data. Using this step will help your business avoid many of the issues surrounding authorship or being trained on copyrighted content. 4. Train your employees. Make sure your leaders and employees are up to date on the most recent legal issues surrounding the use of AI in your industry. 5. Consult your legal team. If there is ever an issue surrounding the use of generative AI or intellectual property, consult your legal team. Head off legal issues before they become legal headaches. Ultimately, as AI continues to evolve, so must the laws governing intellectual property and the business strategies of companies using them.  As long as you and your business are prepared, you can weather these new changes and even prosper. How is your company handling genAI? I would love to hear from you. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
