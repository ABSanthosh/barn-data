  "text": "It’s time to show off your best-in-class company culture. Applications are still open for Inc.’s 2025 Best Workplaces list—an esteemed echelon of companies that place extraordinary value on employee experiences, advancement, and benefits. They’re continually iterating and innovating to improve their workplace to create even better experiences for their teams.  And at a time when many small businesses are struggling to find the talent they need, the companies honored on this list can stand apart from the crowd to prospective and current team members as well as clients, customers, investors, and more.  Last year, 543 companies achieved this recognition. This year, you could join them, provided you meet the eligibility requirements and apply by the March 7 deadline. But if you have more questions, we have answers. Here are five of the most common, answered below:  1. What are you looking for in applications?Tell us how your company achieves excellence in workplace culture. Full stop.  At every company, though, that could look a little different. Take some of last year’s standout honorees: Garrett Companies, the full-service real estate company based in Greenwood, Indiana, offers employees who have worked for the company for at least six years up to $100,000 in tuition assistance for their children’s education. Meanwhile, the Plano, Texas-based consulting firm Vested Group offers an in-house life coach.  In other words, while approaches might vary, we are looking for the best of the best in culture. So, share with us why that should include you.  2. How are honorees selected? Honorees are selected based on a company audit as well as an employee survey, facilitated through our partnership with Quantum Workplace. The combination of these two scores is used to determine which companies will make the list (but the list is not publicly ranked). Note: You must reach the required number of employee surveys submitted to be eligible, and that number will depend on your company’s size.  3. What’s in this for my company?  Being named to the Best Workplaces is, to put it plainly, a big deal. You’ll receive national recognition with this achievement, with a unique profile on Inc.com (a site that draws millions of monthly viewers). Select honorees will also be featured in the Summer 2025 issue of Inc. Magazine.  But more than that, a spot on the Best Workplaces list is an endorsement of your commitment to the employee experience—something that carries weight for both retention and recruitment.  4. What happens if we’re not selected? Even if you don’t make the list this time around, you’ll still receive a huge perk: a snapshot report, generated by Quantum Workplace, that gives valuable insight into your employee survey data. With that, you can plot a course to build an even stronger workplace culture.  5. How do I apply? You can get started on your application today. The deadline is coming up on Friday, March 7, and if you have any questions that weren’t answered here, you can reach out to: bestworkplaces@inc.com.",
