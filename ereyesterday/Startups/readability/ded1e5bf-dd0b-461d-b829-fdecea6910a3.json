Bhd., the creators of the internationally acclaimed Upin \u0026 Ipin franchise, has commissioned Streamline Studios to develop the Upin \u0026 Ipin console game. And Les’ Copaque Sdn. Bhd and Streamline Media Group, previously focused on external game development, have agreed to establish a partnership to jointly publish Upin \u0026 Ipin Universe. Upin \u0026 Ipin Universe is the first open-world console and PC game featuring the beloved twins. Built in Unreal Engine 5, it offers a stunning next-generation adventure. Launching in 2025, Upin \u0026 Ipin Universe is an ambitious open-world game that will bring the charm and vibrancy of the iconic series to a global gaming audience. This is probably one of the biggest franchises that many Westerners haven’t heard about, said Alexander Fernandez, CEO of Streamline Studios and Streamline Media Group, in an interview with GamesBeat. With Upin \u0026 Ipin captivating audiences in over 100 countries and boasting immense popularity in Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia, the franchise has garnered billions of views on YouTube and is featured on major platforms like Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime. Upin \u0026 Ipin Universe will be an open world. “This will be coming out in the summer, and it’s a universe based on the IP for the biggest cartoon franchise in Southeast Asia,” Fernandez said. “It’s been running for 20 plus years in 100 countries, 12 hours a day, three days a week. It’s been around since The Simpsons.” The game world will have eight mini games, including missions in the fully open world. It’s based on Unreal Engine 5 and the demo looked pretty cool to me. “This is basically showcasing the realization of all the investments in the region and the fact that we can make high end triple-A games out there,” he said. “We’re very happy about the work and what’s been done. We realize this local content will appeal in the local neighborhood. But like Black Myth: Wukong, we think this content will be interesting to the whole world.” This partnership marks a groundbreaking step, expanding the franchise’s reach beyond conventional media entertainment and licensing into the elite interactive entertainment space. It’s also a big deal for Streamline Media Group, which has been around for 24 years but has previously focused on making games for other companies. “For years, Upin \u0026 Ipin has been about celebrating family, friendship, and community,” said Haji Burhanuddin Md Radzi, managing director of Les’ Copaque Production, in a statement. “This partnership with Streamline Media Group allows us to extend our storytelling into an entirely new medium, givingfans the chance to engage with Upin and Ipin’s world like never before.” “We are thrilled to collaborate with Les’ Copaque Production to bring Upin \u0026 Ipin into the global gaming spotlight,” said Fernandez. “We recognized this as an opportunity to expand the franchise into a fully realized openworld experience, delivering the depth and immersion fans expect from a premium console and PC game. By merging Les’ Copaque’s rich storytelling with our expertise in world-class game development, Upin \u0026 Ipin Universe will become a transformative project for the franchise and for Southeast Asian content as a whole.” Discover the Magic of Kampung Life – A Village Adventure with Upin \u0026 Ipin The maker of Upin \u0026 Ipin In Malaysia, ‘kampung’ refers to a village—a way of life steeped in tradition, community, and warmth.
