By analyzing search trends and business application data, the study provides insights into the most sought-after side gigs and the regions driving new business creation.Dropshipping leads the pack as the most searched side hustle, with 5,000 monthly searches. Other popular ventures include landscaping (2,100 searches), photography (2,000), lawn care (1,800), and pet sitting (450). Notably, three of the top five—landscaping, lawn care, and pet sitting—fall under the category of home services, highlighting the continued demand for businesses that enhance home aesthetics and maintenance.Entrepreneurial enthusiasm varies widely across states, with Wyoming demonstrating the highest number of new business applications per capita in September—720.46 per 100,000 residents. Delaware follows with 449.2 applications per 100,000 residents.
