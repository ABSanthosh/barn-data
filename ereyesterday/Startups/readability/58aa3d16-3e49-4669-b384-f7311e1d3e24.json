  "text": "In March, some Trump voters felt deceived after their government jobs were eliminated. Now billionaires—one of whom endorsed Trump last year, according to The Hill—feel they are a victim of a bait and switch because of Trump’s tariffs and the trade war they’re inciting. Last December, Bill Ackman—who runs Pershing Square, a New York-based hedge fund, and is worth an estimated $8.9 billion—was practically beside himself with glee over Trump’s election victory. “We’re stepping into the most pro-growth, pro-business, pro-American administration I’ve perhaps seen in my adult lifetime,” he gushed according to the New York Times.This week? He signs a different tune. “This is not what we voted for,” wrote Ackman in a Sunday post on X. Other billionaires share Ackman’s disagreement with Trump’s tariffs—which as of April 2 had risen from 8.6 percent to 22.3 percent, according to The Budget Lab At Yale. Howard Marks (worth $2.2 billion), is co-chairman of investment firm Oaktree Capital,. In an interview on Bloomberg Television, he called Trump’s trade war, “A step toward isolation for the United States.” Marks preceded this remark by saying, “We’ve gone from free trade and world trade and globalization to this system, which implies significant restrictions on trade in every direction.”  I agree with these billionaires and see three ways Trump’s tariffs will kill innovation—particularly in the U.S.Business Is a Confidence Game “Business is a confidence game,” wrote Ackman in his post. “The president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe. The consequences for our country and the millions of our citizens who have supported the president—in particular low-income consumers who are already under a huge amount of economic stress—are going to be severely negative,” he added.How so? Ackman argued his policy of “massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies” wages “economic war against the whole world at once.” In so doing, Trump is destroying confidence in America “as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital,” he concluded.Talented workers are also losing confidence in America. Prior to imposing high tariffs on April 2, Trump was already chilling the flow of talent to the U.S. by abruptly revoking the visas of students—and in the case of a Tufts student, shipping them to a prison in Louisiana. As of April 7, the Trump administration had revoked the visas of “more than two dozen students or former students at colleges and universities across Massachusetts” including Harvard, Northeastern, and many others, according to the Boston Globe. As I wrote about in a March Inc. post, innovation flourishes in places where talent flows. Such regions operate the most vital Startup Commons—a collection of shared resources including universities, pillar companies, investment capital providers, mentor networks—and startup-friendly values that attract ever-more of the world’s top entrepreneurs.Innovation Needs Investment Trump’s haphazard tariff policy creates high uncertainty among executives and venture capitalists. The uncertainty is killing long-term investments that need “three to five years of predictability” to unlock, according to my April 7 interview with Ritesh Idnani, CEO of Firstsource Solutions, a 32,000 employee provider of systems for health care and financial services firms.And investments—or at the very least, growth—will likely slow down. JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, another billionaire (worth a reported $2.2 billion), is also concerned. Inc.’s Melissa Angell wrote on April 7 that Dimon has “emphasized the potential for stagflation, calling it “an economic boogeyman that transpires during times of stalled economic growth, coupled with inflation. The company revised its growth forecasts amid last week’s tariffs; JPMorgan previously saw U.S. GDP expanding by 1.3 percent for the year, but now believes GDP will shrink by 0.3 percent.”Innovation Requires Competition Trump’s tariffs aim to encourage countries to build and sell products within their geographic boundaries—which inhibits competition and lowers the incentive to innovate. “We’re going to keep your foreign competitors out. What’s the incentive to innovate in that kind of environment?” said Colin Grabow, associate director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. “If you look around the world, countries that are more closed and more protectionist don’t tend to be cradles of innovation.” What Wall Street Wants Next Ackman called for Trump to call a “90-day time out” to give him time to negotiate and solve “asymmetric tariff deals, and induce trillions of dollars of new investment in our country.”Otherwise, he fears “economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate,” notes Inc. Two other analysts offer other prescriptions. “With nations seeking to cut deals with the Administration…the President is well positioned to start claiming some victories—he just needs to want to seize them,” Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, told the Journal.I agree with a different analyst’s view. “We believe that Wall Street and Main Street prosper and suffer together,” Ed Yardeni, founder of Yardeni Research, told clients in an April 6 note featured by the Journal. “The Trump administration disagrees.”The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
