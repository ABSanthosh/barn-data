  "text": "March 24, 2025 1:15 PM The Game BusinessImage Credit: The Game Business Journalist Christopher Dring announced the launch of The Game Business, a new media brand dedicated to covering the game industry, with backing from Geoff Keighley. Game journalism has been a tough place to be, with lots of layoffs that have come with similar troubles in the game industry. Dring and other journalists recently departed from GamesIndustry.biz, a similar publication owned by Gamer Network Limited, an IGN Entertainment company and subsidiary of Ziff Davis. But in a press release, the company argued that its presence is needed now “at a moment when the global video game industry is reshaping the landscape of entertainment and surpassing every other medium in cultural influence.” The games industry could certainly benefit from more transparency and good intelligence, and that’s what GamesBeat tries to do as well. I’m glad to see this happen, as there has been far too much news around game news publications shutting down. The Game business will be a global media brand dedicated to empowering industry professionals and gaming enthusiasts alike with essential insights, trends, and strategic opportunities shaping the future of interactive entertainment. Christopher Dring is founder and editor-in-chief of The Game Business. TGB is a next-generation, platform-agnostic trade publication designed to illuminate the evolving gaming landscape. The company will deliver insightful B2B podcasts, engaging newsletters, and industry-defining events, equipping audiences with critical market intelligence, actionable business analysis, and diverse perspectives from leading publishers, indie developers, and change makers. TGB will offer exclusive industry insights through a free, must-read Substack newsletter, along with The Game Business Show, a twice-weekly video podcast hosted by Christopher Dring. Meanwhile, The Game Business Live event will debut as part of the Summer Game Fest, which is owned by Keighley, in Los Angeles on June 9. The event is billed as a thought-leadership summit uniting visionary creators and top business leaders from across gaming and entertainment. Keighley is best known for running The Game Awards. Attendees will gain firsthand insights into emerging opportunities, upcoming challenges, and transformative industry trends directly from the minds shaping the future of interactive entertainment. Subscribers to The Game Business will receive priority ticket access, with an exciting lineup of influential speakers to be unveiled in the coming weeks. “The mission of The Game Business is to support the health of the gaming industry and to clarify its complexities for consumers,” said Dring, editor-in-chief and founder of The Game Business, in a statement. “My goal is to connect industry members to engage in open and constructive discussions about how we can make this business stronger, better, and more sustainable for everyone who cares about this medium and its future.” “Christopher Dring is a singular talent in the video game industry and deeply invested in the health and growth of our sector,” said Keighley, in a statement. “When Christopher presented me with his idea of starting this venture, I was eager to help him create a new type of trade publication that aligns perfectly with how our industry consumes critical business intelligence today—fast, focused, and forward-thinking.” Christopher is an 18-year games media veteran specializing in the business of video games. He spent nine years at UK business weekly MCV, including five years as editor, working across the magazine, website and its various awards and conferences. He joined GamesIndustry.biz in 2016 and oversaw editorial, commercial, strategy and events. He led the brand’s global event expansion, was the architect behind the Best Places To Work Awards, and he’s a tiny bit obsessed with market data.
