The state has about 4,996 private jet flights per 100,000 people and recorded 36,650 private jet departures in 2023.However, it is important to note that Alaska has many areas that are inaccessible by road, which makes airplane travel necessary throughout many parts of the state, according to Travel Alaska.

Shockingly, New York (No. 48) and Connecticut (No. 49) were low on the list. New York flies 472 private jets per 100,000 residents, according to the data, while Connecticut only saw 414 departures per 100,000.Related: Starbucks' New CEO Will Have the Use of a Private Jet from California to Seattle Every Week to Meet Its RTO RulesHere are the top 10 states with the most private jet usage based on population, according to Rustic Pathways:1.
