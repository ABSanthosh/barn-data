Now, Robinsun has developed solar kits that can be easily installed by anyone. By self-installing, users can bring down the price of solar system adoption and speed up deployment. In fact, installation takes just minutes, and the kits start producing energy immediately. In addition, Robinson’s kits use the latest generation of top-quality components, such as those used by installation companies. This includes bifacial solar panels, which produce energy from both sides and boost production by up to 30 per cent. Using higher-quality equipment means the panels will retain their efficiency for a lot longer, allowing Robinsun to extend its production guarantee to 30 years. More efficient technology also means more electricity generation, so customers will enjoy a shorter payback period and start saving on their energy quickly. The kits can also be installed in a variety of locations, such as balconies, terraces, or sunny walls, making them suitable for those without roof access. Robinson founder Boris Hageney told Springwise that Robinsun was born because he was inspired to help in the fight against climate change. “It feels wonderful to know that every solar kit that leaves our warehouse will have such a positive impact on a family somewhere, for a long time, and at the same time help us to lower our carbon footprint significantly every day,” Hageney explained. Robinsun is currently raising a financing round. Hageney explained that this will help the company open up a range of growth opportunities, both in terms of market as well as in its product offering. According to Hegeney, it will help Robinsun go beyond solar kits e-commerce and “execute on our vision to become the one-stop-shop for families’ residential energy solutions”.
