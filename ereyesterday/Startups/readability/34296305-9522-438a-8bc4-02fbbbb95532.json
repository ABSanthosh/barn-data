  "text": "In 2024, we saw a huge shift in how companies approached diversity, with many throwing out or radically changing diversity, equity, inclusion programs. Companies like John Deere, Walmart, and Tractor Supply Co. all made massive changes to their DEI programs in response to pressure from conservative groups led by Robby Starbuck. Today, McDonald’s announced that they, too, will cease some DEI practices, such as “requiring its suppliers to commit to certain DEI targets.” A different conservative group, the National Center for Public Policy Research, has pushed Costco to abandon its DEI principles, arguing that the legal risk of such programs is too high (in 2023, Starbucks lost a wrongful termination lawsuit filed by a White manager) and citing the number of major corporations who are rolling back DEI initiatives. But at the start of this year, Costco’s board of directors said no and urged shareholders to vote against the rollback of its DEI programs. In materials released for a shareholder vote scheduled for January 23, 2025, Costco’s board wrote, in part: For our employees, these efforts are built around inclusion – having all of our employees feel valued and respected. Our efforts at diversity, equity and inclusion remind and reinforce with everyone at our Company the importance of creating opportunities for all. We believe that these efforts enhance our capacity to attract and retain employees who will help our business succeed. This capacity is critical because we owe our success to our now over 300,000 employees around the globe. Robby Starbuck’s campaign to end corporate DEI programs is bolstered by his strong presence on X — his post taking credit for ending McDonald’s DEI program, already has 1.4 million views. As a result, X and other social media platforms can exert real feelings of pressure on business leaders. This isn’t new. Companies live and die by social media. Remember when Chipotle fired a manager for a viral video (and then reinstated her after conducting an investigation)? Or Bud Light’s disastrous social media partnership with Dylan Mulvaney? Sometimes companies make the right decision about social, but sometimes companies make the mistake of believing that because something is popular on social media, it will be popular with their customers. Your customers are not necessarily equally represented on social media. In 2019, when Twitter leaned strongly left, 80 percent of tweets made by just 10 percent of its users. When Twitter became X, the new name wasn’t the only big change — the platform started leaning more toward the right. In 2024, Republicans were more likely than Democrats to get news and information from X (29 percent versus 21 percent). And some research has showed that X’s algorithm favors Elon Musk’s posts as well as some Republican voices. So, when businesses make decisions based on what is popular on social media platforms like Twitter/X, they may be making biased decisions. In 2019, those decisions would have had a liberal bias; now, it’s more likely they have a conservative bias. Not confusing your customer or employee base for a social media base isn’t just important — it’s vital. Why DEI Works for Costco But Costco has a different customer base than other companies. While their statement opposing DEI changes focuses on how it benefits employees, it’s important to remember that without customers, it doesn’t matter how happy your employees are. Investopedia describes Costco customers as older than the general population, and very female heavy, with 72 percent of shoppers being women. These customers are also very loyal: Costco has a 90 percent membership renewal rate. Research shows that women value DEI at work more than men, were more likely to vote for Harris over Trump (54 percent versus 44 percent), and overall are more likely to identify as liberal. If Costco’s board of directors even glanced at their customer demographics, it’s no wonder they decided to say no to calls to change or end the company’s DEI programs. If employees and customers are happy with things as they are, why change? Of course, this isn’t true of every company. Walmart customers also tend to be female, but the average income is lower than Costco’s. Costco shoppers also tend to live in urban centers, which tend to lean left, compared to Walmart’s dominance in rural areas. Will Costco’s DEI programs survive the shareholder vote? That is still to be seen. But it’s definitely a push back against a changing landscape, and it may be enough to stave off the collapse of DEI that began in 2024.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
