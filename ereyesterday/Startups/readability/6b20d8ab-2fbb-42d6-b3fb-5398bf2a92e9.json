  "text": "The Biden administration has approved more than $1.8 billion for hurricane recovery efforts following storms Helene and Milton, the White House said.  This comes as states across the southeastern U.S. work to recover from the back-to-back hurricanes which caused widespread devastation. Hurricane recovery is expected to take a long time. The storms hit within two weeks of each other. It put strain on federal resources in addition to the tens of billions of insured losses. Biden approved federal aid to help residents and local governments cover expenses, including temporary shelter and water, removing debris and restoring power. Some 8,000 federal personnel are currently on the ground to assist the recovery. The Democratic president has called for U.S. lawmakers — on recess until after the Nov. 5 presidential election — to return to Washington to approve more disaster relief money.
