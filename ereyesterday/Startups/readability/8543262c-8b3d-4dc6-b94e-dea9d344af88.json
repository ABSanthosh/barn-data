  "text": "Inc.’s annual Best Workplaces list, compiled in partnership with Quantum Workspace, highlights companies that cultivate strong company cultures and offer extraordinary employee benefits. This year, one company from Hawaii earned a spot on the list: Indevtech Incorporated, based in Honolulu. At Indevtech, nurturing a strong company culture is all about incorporating “the aloha spirit,” says CEO Scott Cooley. “We make sure that people have the time to take care of family, and Hawaii is all about family.”The IT services company provides 100-percent employer‑paid health care and 401(k) plans that include profit sharing. Indevtech offers a flexible PTO framework to give employees time to tend to family needs. Full-time employees also enjoy perks like free Costco memberships.Further aligning with the “aloha spirit,” the company introduced a digital badge system to recognize employee milestones and achievements. Badges are awarded for positive customer reviews, birthdays, work anniversaries, and peer nominations. The badges can be redeemed for Amazon gift cards, travel vouchers, or other rewards.“One of our staff saved all of his points and what he really wanted was a bunk bed for his girls,” says Cooley.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, July 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
