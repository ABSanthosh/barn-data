  "text": "Delta Air Lines is making a big deal out of celebrating its 100th birthday this year. I guess that makes sense—100 years is a big deal for any business, especially for an airline. A lot has changed since Delta started in 1925 as a crop-dusting fleet. To celebrate, Delta started the year with a splashy keynote at Sphere during CES, and continues this week with the reopening of the Delta Flight Museum. The museum, located next to Delta’s headquarters in Atlanta, is a collection of stories that highlight Delta’s people. I spoke with Allison Ausband, the company’s chief people officer, about the re-opening of the museum and what it reflects about where the company is at as it celebrates 100 years. “The museum is a whole new, reimagined experience,” says Ausband. “It showcases the Delta people everywhere you turn. It is about people and reflection of our culture. It keeps us grounded in how we started, yet shows us and is a reflection of just how far we’ve come.” It tells the history of an airline by telling the stories of its people. That’s intentional on Delta’s part, because of what the airline believes has contributed to its success over the past 100 years. “It’s the people,” Ausband tells me. “They are what makes this place happen. They deliver every day for our customers and for each other, and that’s what makes us so special, in my opinion.” There’s a lot in those few sentences, but it’s the first three words Ausband said that I think are worth considering. “It’s the people,” she told me, and I think it’s one of the things that makes for a truly successful business. It’s true that you can build a business without much regard for your people. You might even be successful by a lot of the ways people measure success—at least, in the short term. On the other hand, building a successful business that lasts for 100 years, with all of the challenges and low points that come from existing for that long, is almost impossible without focusing on your people. “I say it all the time, our value is resilience, but I like to call it grit,” Ausband told Inc. “It is the grit of Delta people that it doesn’t matter how deep the valley—and we’re going to go through them, right, we’re in the airline industry. Every company goes through them, but it doesn’t matter how deep it is, it’s the Delta people who rally around it.” Ausband told the famous story of how, around the time she joined Delta, the airline was in a tough place. It was the 1980s, only a few years after the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, and the company had reported a $17 million loss. Three flight attendants had the idea of buying an airplane as a way to help the company: “We had three of our flight attendants who said, ‘Gosh, you know, Delta’s going through a tough time. We need to do something.’ And so they came up with a bright idea of, ‘let’s buy an airplane.’ They called up the CFO at the time and said, ‘We want to buy an airplane.’ And he responded, ‘Do you know how much an airplane costs?’ And they said, ‘We don’t know, but tell us.’ And he told them, and they said, ‘Fine, we’ll make it happen.’ And you know, when I joined in as a flight attendant shortly thereafter, everybody was payroll deducting to buy Delta an airplane.” In fact, more than 7,000 employees contributed payroll deductions to buy Delta its first 767, which flew for 23 years and now sits in the Delta Flight Museum. “Any company can lose their way if they don’t stay grounded,” Ausband told Inc. “As I was gearing up for the 100 years this year, I look back at all eight of our CEOs, and every single one of them—it was about people first.” I interviewed Delta’s current CEO last year, and he told me the story of an interview he did where he asked to describe his job in five words or less. “Take care of our people,” he said. “It isn’t easy, because you do go through tough times,” said Ausband. “But I think for us, we’ve been a firm believer that if you put our people first and we invest in our people, it’s the virtuous cycle, right? You invest in your people; they will, in turn, pour into our customers. Then, you get the shareholder return. And you know, how we’ve been able to keep that and maintain it is our culture.” That isn’t to say that the company always makes the right choices or that its people always feel like they’re taken care of. That’s hard to do with more than 100,000 employees spread around the world. But, it definitely won’t happen if it doesn’t start at the top.
