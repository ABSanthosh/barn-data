She would also provide babysitters for employees who wanted to bring their kids to work and offered plenty of office perks, like yoga classes, free lunches, and massages.Corcoran recognized top performers by giving gold ribbons to anyone who closed a million-dollar sale, and gave one of her top brokers a Bentley with the license plate \"SOLD1\" to highlight her stellar performance in front of the whole company. She additionally claims to have thrown \"the wildest parties in town\" for her employees, complete with their own \"wacky\" themes — and dressing up was mandatory.The end result of these initiatives?

Corcoran also noted in an Instagram video in March that she is \"the best boss\" she has ever met because she follows a simple principle: She works for whoever works for her. In other words, she works for her employees, and her perspective is always tied to what she can do for them.\"I shower my people with anything they need selflessly,\" Corcoran said in the video, adding later that, \"I don't think anyone could be a better boss than me.\"Corcoran is now an original cast member of \"Shark Tank.\" She has appeared on the show for 16 seasons and made more than 650 deals.
