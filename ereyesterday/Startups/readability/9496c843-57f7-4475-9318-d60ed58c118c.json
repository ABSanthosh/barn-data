  "text": "A Boston-area hospital is investigating after five nurses who have worked on the same floor have developed brain tumors. Mass General Brigham Newton-Wellesley Hospital said that in total, 11 employees from the fifth-floor maternity unit identified health concerns. Five had brain tumors, all of which are benign. Two of those have the most common, benign type — meningioma, according to the hospital in Newton, Massachusetts, which is about 10 miles west of Boston.“The investigation found no environmental risks which could be linked to the development of a brain tumor,” the hospital’s Jonathan Sonis, associate chief medical officer, and Sandy Muse, chief nursing officer, said in a statement.The hospital said its investigation was completed in collaboration with government health and safety officials and it considered multiple possible sources. It ruled out disposable masks, the water supply, nearby x-rays, and chemotherapy treatment on the floor below, the hospital said.“Based on these results, we can confidently reassure our dedicated team ... and all our patients that there is no environmental risk at our facility,\" the administrators said.
