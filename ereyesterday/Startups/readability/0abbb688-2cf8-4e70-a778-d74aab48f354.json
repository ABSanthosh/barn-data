  "link": "",
  "description": "This is a special inbetweenisode, which serves as a recap of the episodes from last month. It features a short clip from each conversation in one place so you can easily jump around to get a feel for the episode and guest.Based on your feedback, this format has been tweaked and improved since the first recap episode. For instance, listeners suggested that the bios for each guest can slow the momentum, so we moved all the bios to the end. See it as a teaser. Something to whet your appetite. If you like what you hear, you can of course find the full episodes at tim.blog/podcast. Please enjoy! This episode is brought to you by 5-Bullet Friday, my very own email newsletter.Timestamps:Brandon Sanderson: 03:24Seth Godin: 12:08L.A.
