  "text": "When you think of how creators and influencers make money, you probably picture sponsored posts and brand deals. You might think about ads, views, and platform monetization. While brand deals can be very lucrative—creators also get paid directly by TikTok, YouTube, and other platforms when their content performs well—many top creators have additional revenue streams. Over the past decade plus, I’ve put together brand deals with thousands of creators. But I really didn’t understand the variety of other ways creators are earning income until I started CREATOR: The Podcast this year. Here are four of the businesses, side hustles, and projects successful creators use to bolster their incomes.  Publish a book  Books may seem like an old-school, pre-internet way of publishing and making money. But they can be a strong line of business for creators, especially those with a particularly compelling story or point of view, or those who have a strong visual aesthetic, such as photographers. If you use Instagram, odds are you’ve seen at least one of Chris Burkard’s stunning outdoors and adventure photos. You may also have seen them on your friend’s coffee table. Starting with his debut, The California Surf Project in 2009, Chris has published eight books, and he continues to put one out every couple of years. Surprisingly, the one that has sold the most copies is The Boy Who Spoke To The Earth, an award-winning children’s book available in national park book stores. Chris says that early on in his career he realized, “I need my work to constantly be getting in front of new audiences because right now I’m just serving the same group over and over.” Book publishing creates a flywheel approach to finding new audiences. His books attract followers to his social media accounts, which he can also use to promote his books.  Sell consumer goods  Filmmaker, director, host, creator, coffee entrepreneur. Which one of these things is not like the other? Cole Walliser has a massive following of more than 20 million across platforms. His most well-known endeavor is GlamBOT videos from red carpets featuring many of the biggest stars in Hollywood. His latest is a coffee company, CREO, “to fuel your creative mind.” Cole plans to expand the direct-to-consumer brand to farmers markets and popups in Los Angeles. In addition to building a business, CREO provides a new creative and community outlet for him. “I’ve just been obsessed with coffee for a long time,” he says, “and I started sourcing a roast and we made mugs, and we’ve done a bunch of other cool fun things. Like during the month of May, which is Asian American and Pacific Islander (API) Heritage Month, we released Asian-based coffee roasted by an Asian roaster, and all the proceeds went to help API communities.” For someone like Cole, who is deeply immersed in the entertainment industry, having a coffee brand creates valuable diversification. It also switches up the way he spends his time and energy, which can help lead to fresh perspectives and new ways of thinking.  Create a digital product  Creators are used to thinking of their content, or even themselves, as a product. But why not take that mindset a step further and create an actual digital product? Travel creator Elona Karafin announced on CREATOR: The Podcast that she’s building an app called Japan Like a Local that draws on her detailed knowledge of the country. “It’s surprising that there aren’t many Japan apps available, and the ones that are available are super-outdated, mostly Tokyo focused,” she says. Elona and her partner, who is half Japanese and speaks the language, are creating “a very comprehensive Japan app” that includes a booking platform with discounts for hotels, restaurants, and activities. One advantage to a digital product is a potential exit. It would be hard to imagine Elona selling her brand as a creator, but easy to imagine a travel or media brand buying Japan Like a Local once it scales up.  Lead trips  I always ask guests on my podcast, “If your passport only worked in three countries, which would you choose?” Elona chose Japan, of course, but also Afghanistan. She loves visiting the Middle East, particularly countries that are often perceived as dangerous, but which she feels are merely misunderstood. Elona and her partner lead group trips to Iraq and Syria. “Iraq has been quiet for over a decade,” she says. “And we came there, fell in love with the country and said, ‘We have to bring people here. We have to show people that everything that they know about this country is not necessarily incorrect, but it’s not the full picture.’” Her first group trip to Iraq sold out in 24 hours, which led to subsequent trips to Syria. Elona wisely recognized that inspirational travel content—or even an app—isn’t enough to give travelers confidence to visit these countries. They needed first-hand guidance, which created an ideal business opportunity for her. The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, June 27, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
