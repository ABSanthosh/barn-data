  "text": "I’m currently at the Global Entrepreneurship Congress 2025 in Indianapolis. Yesterday, at the end of the day, I spent several hours at High Alpha hanging out with my friends and then doing a Give First: The Power of Mentorship book event with them and about 150 people.One of the questions during the book talk was around mental health and entrepreneurship. I talked about my own experiences with anxiety and depression and explained that my core diagnosis, which I was diagnosed with in my 20s, was obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). I said that one of my goals for being open was to destigmatize mental health issues, especially in the context of entrepreneurship and mentioned that I periodically hear something like “I’m OCD and it’s my superpower” and dismissed that idea as nonsense, since OCD is an insidious thing that gets in the way of so many things in life.While I was in hibernation, I conducted a long-form (60-minute) video interview with NOCD, an outstanding company in Chicago that is now the world’s leading provider of OCD treatment. I mentioned it during the talk yesterday, but woke up this morning realizing I’d never blogged about it.(If you are receiving this via email, a YouTube embed should be included below.
