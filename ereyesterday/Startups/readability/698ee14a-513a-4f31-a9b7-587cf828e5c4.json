Learn More ServiceNow believes that more areas within an enterprise can benefit from agents, and as it upgrades its agent platform and makes acquisitions, the company plans on doubling down on agents even more.  ServiceNow announced the acquisition of Moveworks on Tuesday along with new agent capabilities. It also made its orchestration platform generally available and announced plans to integrate agentic enterprise search.  Amit Zavery, ServiceNow CPO, told VentureBeat that the company sees a lot of potential in the infrastructure around AI.  “There are a lot of things to do in this space and [this new] release has a lot of capabilities around AI agents,” said Zavery. “It’s core elements of a platform, and that’s something we’re going to continue doubling down [on] and investing in.”  ServiceNow has added new agents to its library of pre-built AI agents, including a new security operations (SecOps) agent, a set of autonomous change management agents, and a network test and repair agent. The company also updated its AI Agent Orchestrator and AI Agent Studio, adding new features and making them generally available. Wider agent reach ServiceNow offers pre-built agents for specific teams and also helps customers build their own. The company first announced its library of AI agents in September and has continually added to that library.  The SecOps agent ideally would “help eliminate repetitive tasks and empower SecOps teams to focus on quickly stopping real threats,” said Zavery. The autonomous change management agents will generate custom implementation and tests, while the proactive network test and repair AI agent troubleshoots, detects and diagnoses network issues before performance is impacted. These new agents automate more areas of an organization, and Zavery said ServiceNow is “seeing a lot of new use cases emerge as we see that value for customers.” The company hopes that agents will help employees interact with them differently.  Zavery said that its acquisition of Moveworks and its updated agentic platform allows ServiceNow to expand agentic capabilities to enterprise search, using agents to find any information an employee needs about their organization.  “This is where Moveworks helps us get into and double down on our AI investment going forward,” said Zavery. “We are the workflow leader and have a lot of data capabilities. We’ve been doing a lot of AI-related and very capable use cases delivery there. So that all remains intact and it just accelerates some of those things, especially around AI.” Enhanced orchestration  ServiceNow has also opened up its AI Agent Orchestrator and AI Agent Studio to general availability. The platforms help organizations build agents, onboard and coordinate them. Users can now refer to an analytics dashboard to visualize AI agent usage, quality and value. In a demo to reporters, ServiceNow VP of AI and innovation Dorit Zilbershot said that administrators will be able to clearly see how many tasks the agent is closing and determine if it is working according to plan.  The AI Agent Studio now has guided instructions, which the company says make it “easier than ever to design and configure new AI agents using natural language descriptions.” ServiceNow has long advocated for agents to be part of an organization’s workflow. It also supports “invisible agents” — where employees interact with agents but don’t necessarily know what those agents are doing to fulfill their tasks.  Daily insights on business use cases with VB Daily If you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.
