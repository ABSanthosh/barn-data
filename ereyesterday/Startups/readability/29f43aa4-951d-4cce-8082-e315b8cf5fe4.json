  "text": "“Reorg” is a scary word for me, and I suspect I’m not alone. Early in my career, a large company I worked for announced a major reorganization, cutting over a dozen jobs—including mine. Looking back, the way leaders communicated the upheaval made things worse and only heightened the impact of the bad news.Among their missteps: They sat on the news, fueling rumors. They weren’t specific about why it happened, making layoffs seem arbitrary or targeted. They spent as much time discussing their “painful decisions” as the pain we were about to face. They rationalized that the reorg would ultimately help the brand, which felt irrelevant to those of us potentially facing our last days at work. Delivering good news is relatively easy. But delivering bad news—such as layoffs, team restructuring, budget cuts, and aborted initiatives—is trickier because what you say can severely impact morale, productivity, and your own reputation.The good news is you can avoid making a bad situation worse by steering clear of seven common communication mistakes. We’ll also examine layoff announcements from Block CEO Jack Dorsey, Indeed CEO Chris Hyams, Dragos CEO Robert M. Lee, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, Twitter/X chairman Elon Musk, and Better.com CEO Vishal Garg between 2021 and 2025 that reveal both wise and unwise approaches to communicating the worst news an employee could get.Mistake 1: Sitting on the newsBecause employees often sense bad news before it’s announced, delayed announcements can fuel rumors and misinformation. Share details as soon as possible, even if some questions remain unanswered or you can’t overcome scheduling conflicts.“It’s far better to acknowledge uncertainties and address them later than leave your team waiting, wondering, and potentially jumping to their own conclusions,” says Julie Bolcer, a public affairs executive for New York City agencies. Avoiding delay also means not burying the lead. In Daniel Ek’s 2023 “An Update on December 2023 Organizational Changes” memo announcing a 17-percent reduction in Spotify headcount, he didn’t address the layoffs until he was more than 100 words into the note. Ek didn’t just bury the lead; he buried his empathy, consideration, and transparency as a leader.In his Inc. article, “6 Ways Good Guys Can Deliver Bad News,” Steve Cody, co-founder and managing partner of the marketing firm Peppercom, writes: “Don’t hem and haw…. Get directly to the point and, as one of my former clients used to say, rip off the Band-Aid.”Mistake 2: Overpromising a rosy futureTo soften the blow, some leaders make hopeful but unrealistic promises, such as a permanent end to layoffs or a revenue rebound. But delivering a false sense of security can backfire.“Trying to soften the sting of bad news with unrealistic promises can severely damage a leader’s credibility if they don’t deliver on those pledges,” Bolcer says.Some leaders take that risk. Toward the end of his 2023 memo to staff announcing the layoff of 9 percent of his cybersecurity employees, Dragos CEO Robert M. Lee wrote, “So long as we stay focused on [a new annual plan] and achieve it, there will be no further layoffs.” Fortunately for Lee, he has so far been able to keep that conditional promise.Instead of making risky promises, consider safer, positive expressions, such as setting realistic goals, making commitments, and stating hopeful beliefs, as Ek did when he wrote, “My commitment to our mission and belief in our ability to achieve it has never been stronger.”Mistake 3: Delivering only general informationBeing purposely vague may feel safe, but it can also lead to misinterpretation, heightened anxiety, and false rumors when employees fill in the blanks themselves.“It’s essential for leaders to be specific and not choose what seems like safer general language,” explains James Pearson, a public relations executive with over 20 years of experience at companies including Zeta Global, Audible, and Razorfish. “Clear and detailed communication ensures the message is not misinterpreted or dismissed.”One way leaders unintentionally soften language is by using “not” language, such as “not great news,” “not our finest moment,” and “not what we were hoping for.”In an infamous 2021 Zoom call announcing layoffs for 15 percent of his workforce, Better.com’s Vishal Garg led with, “I come to you with not great news.” Ya think?While speaking in “nots” may sound right, it sidesteps a true description and conveys little meaningful value. After all, no competent job interviewee says, “You should hire me because I’m not the other candidate.” No expert salesperson says, “Our product is not bad.” And no wise CEO should think saying “Here’s the situation we’re not in” will move anyone.Mistake 4: Focusing on silver liningsIn a 2024 memo to staff about reducing company headcount by 8 percent, Indeed’s Chris Hyams wrote, “As difficult as these changes are, our new structure will help us to simplify and work more effectively as one team, reignite growth in revenue, and drive toward our 2030 goal to help 100 million people get jobs.”Hyams was trying to be inspirational, but silver lining sentiments like this seemed tone-deaf to employees who didn’t yet know if they would remain Indeed employees or transition to Indeed users.When workers experience grief over a lost project, colleague, or department—and make no mistake, feeling loss at work is a form of grief—they’re probably uninterested in coincidental upsides, at least during the period of greatest grief and unease.“Spinning bad news to seem positive can come across as insincere,” Pearson says. “Instead, leaders should acknowledge the situation honestly, which enhances impressions of transparency and authenticity.”Mistake 5: Not showing enough empathySome leaders spend too much time soliciting sympathy for themselves instead of empathizing with staff members affected by the decision.Block’s Jack Dorsey wrote, “This is the toughest part of my job,” while Garg wrote, “This is the second time in my career I’m doing this, and I do not want to do this. The last time I did it, I cried; this time, I hope to be stronger.”Whether manipulative or well-meant, this sentiment redirects compassion away from impacted staff and toward the executive.“The best leaders are acutely aware of how their announcements impact staff and avoid making their own feelings part of the message,” Bolcer says. “They understand that their first and foremost responsibility is to empathize with employees whose lives and livelihoods are affected by the bad news.”Positive examples of empathy include Hyams writing, “We know these decisions will have a significant impact on people’s lives…. I know you will need time to absorb this news…. We are committed to bringing as much support to you as possible in the days and weeks ahead.”Both Lee and Ek wisely detailed avenues of help for departing employees, including severance pay, health care coverage extensions, investment plan flexibility, and career support.Even Elon Musk’s terse note to Twitter employees included, “We acknowledge this is an incredibly challenging experience to go through, whether or not you are impacted,” though that warm sentiment was probably undercut by the very next line: “Thank you for continuing to adhere to Twitter policies that prohibit you from discussing confidential company information on social media, with the press or elsewhere.”“Focusing on staff improves a leader’s impression of empathy and understanding, even during difficult times,” Pearson explains. “Staff-focused messages are also relatable to employees, regardless of their role, tenure, or seniority.”Mistake 6: Being defensiveWhile you owe your team an explanation, you don’t need to preempt criticisms or justify every detail. “Over-defending the decision can create confusion, distract attention from key messages, and even undermine those messages,” Pearson notes.Dorsey’s message denied the layoffs were about “trying to hit a specific financial target, replacing folks with AI, or changing our headcount cap.” He also countered potential criticism that he should have made the changes over time instead of all at once. These assertions and arguments may be solid, but they seem more about what Dorsey wanted to get off his chest than what his team needed to hear.Mistake 7: Not taking responsibility“I take full responsibility” is tough to say when a decision has negative consequences, but that accountability enhances leadership qualities of truthfulness and integrity that can outlast the dark clouds.“In the end, employees appreciate leaders who level with them because this shows respect and reinforces trust,” Bolcer said.Good examples of accountability include Hyams writing, “I am responsible for how we got here,” and Lee writing, “As CEO, I bear full responsibility for the actions we take as a company.”Lead with humanityIn moments of organizational crisis, disappointment, or the dreaded reorg, your team doesn’t need to hear from a fact-spinning publicist, detailed analyst, or HR mouthpiece—they need a caring, honest leader. Deliver the news quickly and clearly. Empathize with your team’s feelings. And avoid the urge to soften the message at the cost of their trust and your reputation. Above all, be human.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
