  "text": "Giant streaming platform Spotify has bucked the trend of tech companies mandating a return to the office, maintaining its flexible remote work policy. The company believes that treating employees like adults is essential for fostering a productive and innovative work environment. Spotify’s decision comes in contrast to other tech giants like Amazon and Dell, which have implemented stricter return-to-office policies. Spotify’s Chief Human Resources Officer, Katarina Berg, argues that remote work has not negatively impacted productivity or efficiency. “You can’t spend a lot of time hiring grown-ups and then treat them like children“, she argues.Spotify has offices in major cities worldwide and encourages employees to come together for in-person collaboration during designated “core weeks.” This approach allows the company to maintain a strong team culture while minimizing the environmental impact of commuting. “It is harder and we all struggle to collaborate in a virtual environment”, Berg says. “But does that mean that we will start forcing people to come into the office as soon as there is a trend for it? No.“ [H/T] Digital Music News",
