  "text": "As companies like Amazon, JPMorgan, and Walmart implement return-to-office (RTO) mandates, one business is sweetening the deal by giving its employees a $10,000 annual raise for showing up to the office more often.Cameo, a startup that allows users to purchase and receive personalized video messages from celebrities, began a new RTO policy this week requiring the 26 employees who work at the company's headquarters in Chicago to be in the office Monday through Thursday, per CNBC Make It. The policy, which the company first announced to staff last month, enables employees to receive a $10,000 yearly raise in addition to free parking, a free daily catered lunch, and free access to an onsite gym.\"We really felt like we wanted to make HQ a perk, not a punishment,\" Cameo CEO Steven Galanis told CNBC Make It. \"We know we're asking more out of you to give up the flexibility, and we wanted to compensate you for it.\" Related: AT\u0026T and Sweetgreen Are Following Amazon's Lead With Stricter Return-to-Office Mandates — Though Amazon's Plan Has Hit a SnagCameo has two dozen additional employees based elsewhere in the U.S. and abroad, mainly in New York and Los Angeles. They were allowed to keep working remotely but weren't given a pay raise. Galanis, 37, chose to set the annual raise at $10,000 because the figure would make a \"meaningful\" difference in employees' lives and hoped it would help junior employees find housing nearby instead of taking on long commutes.The Chicago headquarters opened in the summer of 2024, but Cameo leadership never mandated a strict set of days employees had to report to the office. Workers based in Chicago previously came to the office whenever they needed to, showing up an average of two to three times per week, according to Galanis.Cameo CEO Steven Galanis. Jose M. Osorio/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty ImagesWhen Cameo informed its Chicago employees of the four-days-a-week in-office policy last month, it also gave them the option to move out of Chicago to not have to come into the office at all. Cameo found that none of its employees quit or moved away after the announcement. Instead, the opposite happened. Some of Cameo's remote workers based in other locations expressed interest in moving to Chicago and taking advantage of the perks offered to in-office employees.A HealthEquity study released earlier this month surveyed more than 600 full-time employees who shifted from fully remote to hybrid or fully in-person work. Three out of four employees said their RTO experiences were positive, with 74% saying they experienced enhanced collaboration.The top motivators for office attendance weren't free lunches or a raise, it was professional development opportunities (50%) and team-building events (47%). The biggest obstacle to in-person work identified by the survey was commuting costs (54%).Related: Read the Letter Sent to AWS CEO Matt Garman, Signed By 500 Employees, Protesting His RTO Comments Cameo has experienced a tumultuous few years. The pandemic catapulted the startup to unicorn status, with a valuation of $1 billion by 2021. Sales declined by March 2024, erasing 90% of Cameo's value.Galanis told Time in December that he thinks the momentum has shifted in Cameo's favor.\"I'm really grateful for our investors and our team, that they've believed in me and allowed us the second shot to build a company that we don't think has reached near its potential yet,\" he stated.",
