  "text": "Hong Kong-based Signalens is preparing to launch a crowdfunding campaign for the SignalSDR Pro, a high-performance software-defined radio (SDR) unit in a Raspberry Pi-like footprint.\"SignalSDR Pro combines portability with performance. Roughly the size of a credit card or a Raspberry Pi, SignalSDR Pro is the perfect companion for anyone who needs powerful tools without the bulk,\" claims Signalens' KaiJern Lau of the company's creation. \"From signal processing and spectrum analysis to communication systems and beyond, SignalSDR Pro empowers you to quickly tackle complex SDR projects.\"The SignalSDR Pro aims to deliver high-performance flexible software-defined radio in a Raspberry Pi-inspired form factor. (ðŸ“¹: Signalens)The SignalSDR Pro, which does indeed look like a mutated Raspberry Pi, is based on the Analog Devices AD9361 radio transceiver with an AMD Zynq 7020 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) on-board â€” delivering, by the company's claims, a usable 70MHz to 6GHz frequency range. There are gigabit Ethernet and USB 3.0 connections to a host device, with two full-duplex transmit-receive channels operating at a 61.44MHz sampling rate and 12-bit resolution up to a maximum bandwidth of 85kHz.The comparison to a Raspberry Pi isn't limited to appearance, either. To increase the device's flexibility, Signalens has given the SignalSDR Pro a Raspberry Pi-like 40-pin general-purpose input/output (GPIO) header for connection to external hardware. The company also claims it can be switched into modes compatible with rival radio platforms like the ADALM-PLUTO and USRP B210 \"with a simple change in jumper settings and swap of the microSD Card.\"The board comes with a metal enclosure, designed to double as a passive cooling system. (ðŸ“·: Signalens)Each SignalSDR Pro comes with a blank microSD Card, four antennas tuned for 700-3,800MHz plus a GPS antenna, a selection of cables, and two writeable SIM cards for those looking to investigate private cellular network operation. There's also a metal enclosure as standard, designed to provide passive cooling for the electronics inside.Signalens is to start crowdfunding for the device soon, Lau confirms, with interested parties invited to sign up on Crowd Supply to be notified when the campaign goes live.",
