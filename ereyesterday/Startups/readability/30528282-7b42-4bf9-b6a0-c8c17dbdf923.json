  "text": "Most venture capital firms talk about funding, exits, and scale. But Navin Goyal, the anesthesiologist-turned-investor behind LOUD Collective, is more interested in fear.“I look for a little bit of fear in the client,” Goyal says. “Not panic, but that honest moment where a founder admits, ‘Things are going well, but I’m a little stressed. I need help.’ That’s when we know we can do something meaningful together.” LOUD Collective is a “hands-on” venture capital and administrative firm that also provides fractional executive expertise based in Dublin, Ohio.It’s a disarming sentiment in a space usually dominated by polished pitch decks and bravado. But Goyal isn’t interested in perfection. He’s interested in progress and the kind of founder who’s aware enough to admit what they don’t know.“Smart isn’t enough,” he says. “Capital isn’t enough. Those things can be squandered. What we’re building is a founder-first platform that meets people where they are, and helps them get where they’re going.”Building value before the exitLOUD Collective’s recent acquisition of Max Value Advisors, a business succession and certified exit planning advisory, formalizes that approach. The deal launched LOUD Acceleration, an AI-integrated platform designed to help founders boost valuation, improve operations and be ready at all times for a due-diligence evaluation.Goyal says that any company they consider working with must undergo a thorough 30-day custom assessment that goes beyond templated reports. It blends structured financial analysis with interviews across a company’s leadership to create a real-time picture of the business’ health. From there, LOUD builds a centralized, AI-enhanced data room—think of it as a live operating dashboard that lets both internal teams and external investors track KPIs, identify risks and spot growth levers. The system is designed to evolve with the business, offering ongoing support via a fractional On-Demand Executives (CXO) and leadership workshops. It’s not just diagnostic—it’s operational guidance, investor prep and strategic coaching all in one.“Every business should know their value, even if they’re not thinking about selling,” Goyal said. “In the end, you have tools to help you make decisions. And in doing that, you’ve created a structure where if someone wants to buy your company, or if you want to pass it on, it’s a much more transparent way to approach that.”AI as partner, not saviorDespite LOUD’s heavy emphasis on tech, Goyal is cautious about the AI hype. “The goal isn’t to be ‘AI-first,’” he says. “The goal is to solve the right problem.”LOUD’s platform uses AI to sift through data, benchmark against industry standards and deliver live performance dashboards. But that’s just the starting point. The real differentiator, Goyal says, is the human interpretation.“Data on its own is dumb,” he says. “AI can give you information. But insight comes from people. That’s why every assessment we do is paired with real human support – fractional CFOs, operational advisors, leadership coaches – whatever the founder needs.”He adds that the firm’s new training platform, LOUD Academy, is designed to help founders and fractional executives alike stay sharp. “We’re building a community that’s committed to learning because staying still is falling behind,” he says.Unorthodox practices, outsized resultsGoyal’s model might be unconventional, but it delivers results. With nearly 100 portfolio companies, a growing network of fractional CXOs, and a flexible platform that blends AI with hands-on expertise, LOUD Collective is quietly rewriting the rules of modern venture support. And for founders wrestling with uncertainty in an increasingly loud, rapidly evolving world, that kind of steady partnership might be exactly what they need.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
