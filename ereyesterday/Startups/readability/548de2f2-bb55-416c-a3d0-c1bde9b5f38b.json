  "description": "Dr. Iman Abuzeid didn’t set out to disrupt the healthcare hiring system. But after she began listening more closely — especially to nurses — what she heard was an industry full of friction, delays, and burnout. Fixing that friction became the foundation for Incredible Health, a hiring marketplace now used by more than a million healthcare workers. In this episode, Dr. Abuzeid talks with host Jeff Berman about her strategic approach to expansion and how scaling allows her to have more impact — and stay true to her calling.Subscribe to the Masters of Scale weekly newsletter: https://mastersofscale.com/subscribeSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
