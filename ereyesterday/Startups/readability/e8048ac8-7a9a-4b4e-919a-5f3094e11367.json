  "text": "On Wednesday night, about 1,000 journalists, tech workers, and assorted luminaries gathered in an event space near the Golden Gate Bridge. California Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie were both in the crowd when, amid much whooping and whistling, Tools for Humanity founders Sam Altman and Alex Blania announced that on May 1, World which they call a “human-first identity and financial network,” would launch in the United States. Anderson Paak DJ’ed the afterparty, where guests could pick up custom hoodies or make their own smores. But what, exactly, were we all celebrating? “On the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog,” goes a much-memed New Yorker cartoon. When the cartoon was published in 1993, the conceit was that the then-new Internet offered the freedom to present yourself as anything, or anyone, you want. Today, the twist is that the “person” you’re interacting with online may not even be a person at all. Bots have long flooded social networks, inflaming tensions, promoting products, and pushing polarized political discourse. Now, with the advent of generative artificial intelligence tools, it’s getting harder to detect fake photos—and real-time synthetic video could be next. How do you know the person challenging your assertions on Reddit, chatting you up on Tinder, or nabbing a slot ahead of you online for Beyoncé tickets is real? Altman believes the answer lies in offering a sort of digital proof of humanhood. In his telling, about five years ago he began conceptualizing the idea with Alex Blaina on a long walk through San Francisco.  “The initial ideas were very crazy,” Altman said at this week’s launch event, dubbed At Last. “Then we came down to one that was just a little bit crazy.” That would be World parent company Tools for Humanity, the company he launched with Blania, a theoretical physicist by training, as its CEO. The concept, Altman said, was to ensure “humans stayed special and central” in a world where AI is everywhere. This may seem like a contradiction: Another of Altman’s companies, OpenAI, created ChatGPT and other generative AI tools that could cause the kind of mayhem Tools for Humanity is meant to guard against. Or at worst, it’s a cynical play. Make the tools that break how we interact on the internet and then sell us something else to fix it. But Altman seems to genuinely mean what he’s saying—he made a similar pitch last week at the IAPP Global Privacy Summit an annual confab of about 5,000 lawyers and compliance experts, appearing via livestream while Blania, the moderator, and two Orbs (more on those later) sat on stage in Washington, DC.  At its heart, World is a system for verifying someone is human—with a financial network attached that’s also tied to a cryptocurrency called Worldcoin (WLD). Oh, and within the World app there’s a constellation of mini apps the company hopes could one day make World app a sort of “everything app” like China’s WeChat or the expansive vision Elon Musk reportedly laid out for Twitter, after he took it over and rebranded it X. Americans can now line up at shops opening in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, and San Francisco to have a very detailed photograph of their irises taken by an Orb, a spherical device with an extremely high-resolution camera and an Nvidia Jetson chip inside. The plan is to distribute 7,500 Orbs across the U.S. in the next 12 months—and those Orbs will be made at a plant in Richardson, Texas. Tools also just leased an 87,000-square-foot building in San Francisco’s Showplace Square neighborhood, which may explain the mayor’s presence at the event. “I think America should lead innovation, not fight it off,” Altman said, a not-so-subtle nod to the more crypto-friendly mood in Washington since President Donald Trump took office again. Altman visited the White House the day after Trump’s inauguration to announce Stargate, an AI infrastructure initiative launched by OpenAI, Softbank, Oracle, and other partners. Tools for Humanity’s chief business officer, entrepreneur and San Francisco grandee Trevor Traina, is a longtime Trump supporter and ambassador to Austria during his first term. In a press conference after the launch event, Blania said the political environment “certainly” played into the decision to launch in the U.S. now, and he praised the current administration for having “transparent conversations” about crypto regulation. Part of the squeamishness on the part of regulators—not to mention the general public—is the value proposition for the World network: Provide your biometric data (that iris scan) in exchange for Worldcoin. In the U.S., new users who verify their identities get 16 WLD (currently about $25). Hong Kong regulators banned the service in 2024. Later that year, South Korean regulators fined the company for failing to comply with local privacy regulations, and operations are currently on pause in Brazil. Much of the early field testing was done in poor countries where participants might find the prospect of a small cash or cryptocurrency payment for an iris scan tempting. Consumers certainly have reason to be suspicious. After convincing 15 million users to sign up for its DNA testing service, 23andMe is in bankruptcy and users’ DNA information could be sold to the highest bidder. During the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan, military personnel collected iris scans and other biometric data from Afghans serving in the security forces. When the U.S. evacuated in 2021, some of the data-collection devices—and possibly databases of biometric data—fell into the hands of the Taliban. Blania said privacy concerns are “to be expected,” and that the company is working closely with regulators in each country where it operates. And Altman and Blania appear to be adjusting the narrative around Tools for Humanity. No longer do they talk about Worldcoin as a potential source of universal basic income or a means of wealth redistribution. Today, they talk about online safety and establishing proof of humanity. This reset may explain Blania and Altman’s appearance at the privacy conference in April and why the company made executives available to journalists to patiently, repeatedly explain the privacy protections built into the technology. The first thing the company would like everyone to know is that the biometric data collected by the Orb is not stored on the Orb, but transferred to the World app on a user’s phone and then deleted. (This is similar to how Apple’s face recognition works: The face print used to open an iPhone is stored on the device, not Apple’s servers.)  Why irises? If you scan both of them, the company says, you’ll get a pattern so distinct that no two people on Earth are the same. With fingerprints or faceprints, once you move to a global scale, you run into “collisions,” or matches that are close enough that you can’t tell them apart. When a person places their irises before the Orb for the first time, the AI models on the machine affirm that those eyes belong to a human, and the image is compared to a database maintained by Tools for Humanity to ensure they’ve never been scanned before. That data, the company says, is anonymized, with the information split across multiple databases. In theory, even if one or more of those databases were compromised, the data would be useless. There’s nothing to steal or sell. Assuming you’re convinced, when you try to use your World ID to prove you’re a human, say on a dating app, the system uses what’s known as zero-knowledge proof. That means that the app receives confirmation that proof of humanity exists but doesn’t see the underlying data. More than one Tools for Humanity employee compared it to showing your ID to a bouncer at a bar in exchange for a wristband. The bartender knows you’re legal to drink but doesn’t get to see your personal information. (Tools for Humanity is the bouncer in this metaphor.) It’s for when you “want to assert you’re a real person,” Altman said at the IAPP conference, “but keep private which specific person you are.” Altman and Blania imagine a world in which World IDs can be used for everything from online banking to voter verification, but so far, many of the partnerships have been more modest. In March, the online gaming network Razer introduced World ID verification, so players can ensure they’re not competing against bots.  That may change with the new partnerships announced in San Francisco. Among them is a pilot project with Match Group (owner of several dating sites including Tinder and Match) in Japan to verify daters’ personhood. New partnerships with Visa and Stripe will soon let people fund a debit or credit card with Worldcoin or make Stripe payments through the World app. But how can a company that doesn’t charge users—in fact, pays them to join—and doesn’t collect their data make money? Blania said that at the moment the company is focused on building the network. Those crypto payments are like the payments PayPal made in its early days to every user who opened an account—burning through cash to build its user base.  Tools for Humanity is reportedly sitting on about $200 million in funding from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, so it can afford to push the profitability question down the line. At the press conference, Blania laid out several ways that World might eventually make money. First, it’s rolling out a system to charge apps and services that use World IDs to verify users. Transaction fees on the financial services offered within the World app could be another source of revenue. There also may be ways to monetize mini apps inside of World, such as the one just announced with betting market Kalshi. And of course, all those transactions would be done in Worldcoin, helping to boost its value.  There’s still a fundamental question of how many people actually want this. Bots may be annoying, but are you willing to put your eyeball on the blockchain to prove you’re a human? To date, there are about 12 million people verified in the World network, and about 26 million people have accounts, meaning they’ve set up an account in the app, but haven’t verified their identities with a scan. Social media companies have generally been slow to crack down on inauthentic behavior, including fake accounts and automated comments, because it would eat into the overall user base and post volume. I examined the Orb in close proximity on several occasions over the past week, photographing it and even taking a selfie using its lens as a mirror. It’s a compelling object, an off-white spherical objet d’art with a gleaming golden lens. The just announced mini version, which is scheduled to ship in 2026, has its charms as well. Like an iPhone turned on its side, it has two large lenses like eyes ringed with light and a horizontal lighted bar beneath. It appeared to blink at me when I walked up.  At the World store in San Francisco’s Union Square, an employee again patiently explained to me the privacy protections built into the system. Getting $25 in crypto for doing essentially nothing—open your eyes wide, stay still, stare into a lens for several seconds—was hard to pass up. But in the end, I couldn’t bring myself to scan my eyeball.  So, who knows? Maybe this article was written by a Pomeranian.  The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, May 2, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
