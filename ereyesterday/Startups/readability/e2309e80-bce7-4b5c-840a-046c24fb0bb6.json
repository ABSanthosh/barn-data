  "text": "It was a rough week for two high-profile startups. EV-manufacturer Nikola, which raised billions of dollars from companies including General Motors and Bosch, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and plans to sell most or all of its assets. Meanwhile, Humane, makers of a once highly-anticipated AI Pin, sold for pennies on the dollar to HP and announced plans to discontinue support for its flagship product. The company had raised over $230 million in funding and once been valued at $1 billion.Of course, failures aren’t uncommon in the startup world, and there are many reasons a company could go under. In Nikola’s case, bankruptcy followed the 2024 conviction of founder Trevor Milton on fraud charges for exaggerating how much progress the company made on producing its zero-emission 18-wheel trucks. Humane’s product, an AI-powered wearable computer that was positioned as a smartphone replacement, capable of making calls, sending texts and answering questions, underwhelmed customers and was met with scathing reviews when it went on sale. The one-two punch demise of such prominent companies serves as a reminder that sometimes, being a first mover can be a disadvantage. “When you’re doing something new, the margin for error is very small,” says Lindsey Simon, a bankruptcy expert and associate professor at Emory University School of Law. In the early 20th century, between 1900 and 1919, there were roughly 2,000 companies across America that were involved in the manufacturing of motor vehicles, the revolutionary technology of the day. Fast forward to today and there are three dominant automakers in the U.S.Both the EV and AI spaces are in roughly the same place today that the auto industry was then. And both are seeing a glut of startups fighting for customers and funding. Many of those will ultimately be acquired—and many will likely fail.That failure can happen even when the concept is strong. Nikola was founded on the idea of bringing electric trucks to the long-haul shipping industry, using hydrogen and electricity to fuel its vehicles, but it ultimately failed to deliver that product before running out of cash. Humane, created by two ex-Apple engineers, made a big splash at CES 2024, promising to free people from staring at their phone all day and offer more convenience on everyday tasks like looking for directions or making a note of something. But Humane failed to execute on the concept and reviews blasted the product. The company aimed to sell 100,000 devices in its first year, but only sold a tenth of that, according to reports.It’s a tale that’s told time and again. Adam Osborne, who invented the first laptop computer in 1981, initially saw wild success, with a 25-month backlog of orders at one point. His company, Osborne Computer Corp., went bankrupt in just three years. Netscape was the browser of choice in the early days of the web, boasting a market share of over 90 percent and seeing a valuation of nearly $3 billion. Less than 10 years later, that market share has fallen to less than 1 percent.MySpace gave way to Facebook. And more recently, investors have wondered if DeepSeek could unseat OpenAI.Being a trailblazer comes with unique challenges. Companies that are first to market have considerably higher costs. They have to finance the learning curve on how to make a product or service that appeals to customers—and then they have to pay for marketing to educate those customers on why the product is worth paying for. Once that’s done, the cycle begins again, with refinements.“Generally, first movers win when there are high regulatory barriers or if there’s high capital intensity,” says Daniel Kang, former SoftBank investor, co-founder of Y-Combinator backed startup Flowbo and author of The Super Upside Factor. “Everything else is fair game, assuming there’s similar founder-market fit. The first [startup] makes more mistakes generally and needs more resources to do it. The second one has a late start, but needs less resources to go do it.”Oftentimes, the success or failure of a startup comes down to making a good product and launching at the right time.Figuring out that perfect moment is getting more challenging, though. The mobile phone was first patented in 1917 and made real in 1973, but didn’t become a common item until the early 2000s. Adoption rates for new technologies are speeding up, however. The internet took just seven years to reach 25 percent market penetration. Facebook reached that level in two years. And Pokemon Go hit that level of popularity in just 19 days.“The first-mover advantage is increasingly rare,” said Amit Garg, managing partner and cofounder of Tau Ventures in a 2023 LinkedIn post. “Don’t worry if you are not the first right now. What you need to make sure is the track is long enough for you to run a splendid race.”The application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is Friday, March 7, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
