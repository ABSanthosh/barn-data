  "text": "After fundamentally transforming how people find information on the internet with ChatGPT, OpenAI is launching ChatGPT agent, a new feature that will use the internet for you to do things like ordering products and scheduling meetings.ChatGPT agent enables ChatGPT to essentially use its own virtual computer. It’s now available for ChatGPT Pro, Plus, and Team members.In a livestreamed video, OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman revealed ChatGPT agent as a “unified agentic model.” (An AI agent, sometimes referred to as agentic AI, is an AI model that has been given tools that enable it to take actions.) ChatGPT agent combines elements of ChatGPT, the company’s Operator agent, which can interact with websites, and deep research, OpenAI’s feature that enables ChatGPT to conduct high-level research based on web search.ChatGPT agent exists as a tool in the ChatGPT app that users can access in the same way as selecting the web search or deep research features. “We gave the agent access to its own virtual computer,” explained Isa Fulford, a member of OpenAI’s technical staff. With this virtual computer, ChatGPT agent can operate a web browser, write code in a terminal, and connect to external data sources like Google Drive. In a demonstration, OpenAI employees asked ChatGPT agent to help them plan a trip for an upcoming destination wedding. The agent opened up its own browser and started searching for hotel options, suit options, ideas for wedding gifts, and more. When ChatGPT agent comes to an important step in its task, like placing an order or sending an email, it will ask users to confirm that it has successfully completed the task.In other words, if regular ChatGPT is about communicating with a chatbot to get answers, ChatGPT agent is about asking a chatbot to take out its own computer and get things done for you. Other examples of what ChatGPT agent can do include looking at your calendar and suggesting ideal meeting times, buying groceries to cook a specific recipe, and creating spreadsheets based on public or proprietary data. In addition, ChatGPT agent can be interrupted while it’s in the middle of completing a task, so if you notice that it seems to be going down an unnecessary rabbit hole, you can set it on the right path without waiting for it to finish. According to Altman, ChatGPT Pro users, who pay $200 per month, will get 400 queries per month with ChatGPT agent, while Plus users, who pay $20 per month, and those on ChatGPT Team (OpenAI’s product for startups), will get 40 queries per month. ChatGPT Enterprise and Education members can expect to get access to ChatGPT agent before the end of July. OpenAI’s CEO cautions that the feature may not be totally baked just yet. On X, Altman wrote that he would explain ChatGPT agent to his family as “cutting edge and experimental; a chance to try the future, but not something I’d yet use for high-stakes uses or with a lot of personal information until we have a chance to study and improve it in the wild.” OpenAI’s announcement reveals a very different strategy for agentic AI compared to fellow AI company Perplexity, which recently launched Comet, an agentic browser that can read and interact with websites. It’s unclear if OpenAI still plans to release its own browser. Watch a quick video about agent, below: The final deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, July 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
