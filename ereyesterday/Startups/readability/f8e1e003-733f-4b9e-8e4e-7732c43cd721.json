Photo: Getty ImagesListen to this ArticleMore info0:00 / 0:00Fyre Festival, the forever tarnished brand founded by convicted fraudster Billy McFarland, sold on eBay for the cool price tag of $245,300. The transaction took place on the platform Tuesday. An unknown buyer is now the owner of the only brand synonymous with sad cheese sandwiches. Fyre Festival was billed as the ultimate luxury music festival and attracted droves of hot young influencers to an island in the Bahamas in 2017. When attendees arrived, there was nothing but ramshackle tents and the previously mentioned cheese sandwiches—defying the marketing that billed the festival as a party in paradise. Two major documentaries about the festival on both Netflix and Hulu were widely watched in the festival’s aftermath. McFarland was sentenced on various fraud charges in 2018 and served three years in prison. He still owes defrauded investors around $26 million. It’s unclear what the buyer’s incentive is for acquiring Fyre Festival, which became an internet sensation as trapped influencers struggled to escape squalid conditions at the festival site. Even so, one other zombie brand that remains known for the wrong reasons is making a comeback. Enron announced it was back from oblivion late last year, albeit under the leadership of Conor Gaydos, an internet prankster who went viral in 2017 for starting a fake conspiracy that birds aren’t real. The real Enron was an energy conglomerate that collapsed in 2001 after its leadership misled regulators about its stock price (and various other misdeeds). McFarland tried to resurrect the party. He announced Fyre Festival 2 would take place in Mexico in 2024, but those plans were canceled in April following pushback from Mexican authorities, who said the festival had never been given a permit. It’s safe to assume the festival’s new owner will face a similarly uphill battle in finding a venue. The final deadline for the 2025 Inc.
