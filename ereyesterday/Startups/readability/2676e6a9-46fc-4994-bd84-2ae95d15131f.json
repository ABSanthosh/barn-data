  "text": "The cost of war can be measured in myriad ways. Dollars—and years—spent fighting, and, of course, lives lost. That human cost makes the use of artificial intelligence and unmanned battle technology—like drones—a reasonable strategy to explore.A new book, The Hand Behind Unmanned: Origins of the U.S. Autonomous Military Arsenal (Bridging the Gap), argues that the U.S. military’s innovation strategy for AI and unmanned technology is twofold: the goal is to win, and to prevent loss of life where possible.“The American public is generally casualty averse,” says author Jacquelyn Schneider in an event at the Center for a New American Security. Because of this, she says, “we need to invest in technology that allows for missions that prioritize force protection.”She and co-author Julia MacDonald explain in their book how the U.S. military’s unmanned programs developed through recent conflicts, and where those programs are headed, given advancements in AI. “It’s about the distance between the human and the battlefield,” MacDonald explains.  The book provides a comprehensive historical overview, tracing unmanned technologies from early innovations like land mines to contemporary drones and looks at how they will be equipped with AI as it continues to improve.These ideas, according to the pair, are rooted in recent conflict. The conflicts that filled the two decades after 9/11 for example, saw the U.S. military generate extremely advanced, expensive systems that could deliver decisive victories. “In the case of the United States, that meant, ‘let’s invest in technologies that are long range, that give precision and that allow for a much quicker and overwhelming victory,’” she says. “It’s kind of a war of unmanned maneuver.”The lessons the military learned in Afghanistan and Iraq have informed so much of how the U.S. military has built its unmanned programs, but that may not be the way of future wars, as we’ve seen in Ukraine, and what we could see in a conflict with China.“I think Ukraine has sort of fundamentally shifted the way we view unmanned technologies,” MacDonald says.  “You turn to Ukraine, and all of a sudden it’s kamikaze drones. Mines are back. You have off-the-shoulder one-shot drones.”But the U.S. military isn’t currently prepared for a protracted war of attrition like the one in Ukraine, MacDonald explains. The U.S. tends to choose to invest in advanced, expert, expensive, and limited—tech versus cheap tech that can be mass-produced. “I think if we’re going to bias in one direction, we should bias towards buying more stuff much, much cheaper, and that means you’re probably trading off some level of intelligence, and you’re probably trading off some level of precision,” Schneider says.She essentially explains that two narratives emerged from recent U.S. military conflicts that informed the unmanned arsenal we have today. First, we needed to use technology to eliminate the loss of human operators or deploy troops to engage in ground campaigns if we can. But the other line is that the tech must guarantee victory.“Military technology creates these revolutionary advances in military effectiveness, and it is a military’s job to identify that technology, adopt that technology in order to make sure that you can win,” she says. “Somewhere along the way, these two narratives—technology as a revolution in military affairs and casualty aversion—merged, shaping how we think about war today.”But as unmanned tech advances, it needs to get smarter, the authors note. Enter AI. They describe the future of autonomous tech not as “unmanned” per se, but “un-humanned.”“It’s almost impossible to talk about unmanned without talking about artificial intelligence and autonomy, because as you move towards an un-humanned that is closer to autonomous, it is all enabled by AI systems,” Schneider says.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
