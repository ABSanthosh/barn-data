Current version: v2, 1/22/2025. v1, 01/03/2025. DIY Web Archiving shows you why everyone should participate in preserving the things on the web they care about, and how anyone can do so (no special expertise required!). Based on the 11/25/2024 virtual workshop co-sponsored by WebRecorder, SUCHO, and ACH; taught by Walsh, Kremer, Dombrowski, \u0026 Kijas; with additional text/resources from \u0026 zineified by Amanda Wyatt Visconti. Available now: Full-color PDF of zine: suitable for reading on your computer, or printing in full color Poster version of front cover with added arrows/text encouraging folks to take copies of the zine; useful if you want to print a pile to leave in public (place poster above or next to pile) Coming soon: Zine Bakery catalogue entry for this zine containing blurb, descriptive metadata, etc. (entry exists, but not complete yet/not public) Black-and-white version of zine: misses out on some photo details and fun color design, but printable if you don’t have a color printer; and/or if you need a higher-contrast zine for reading accessibility. Printing \u0026 assembly instructions. Read the zine online I’ll eventually post images of each page here, so you can read directly on this webpage.",
