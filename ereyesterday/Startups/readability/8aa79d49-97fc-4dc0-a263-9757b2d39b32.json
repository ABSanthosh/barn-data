  "text": "May 16, 2025 2:35 PM Epic Games is still tangling with Google and Apple on antitrust.Image Credit: Epic Games Epic Games Apple has blocked Epic’s submission of Fortnite to the U.S. Apple App Store and the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union. “Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it,” Epic Games said in a tweet. Epic Games had hoped that it would be able to return its game, which has been off iOS since Epic sued Apple for antitrust violations in 2021. A new law in the EU is expected to force Apple to comply at some point, and a recent ruling in the U.S. federal antitrust lawsuit by Epic was expected to force Apple’s hand. We await further explanation for why Apple is still blocking Fortnite’s return. And we have asked Apple for comment. GB Daily Stay in the know!
