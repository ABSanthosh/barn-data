  "text": "Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. Every day, we're bombarded with noise — emails, ads, pop-ups, sponsored posts and DMs from strangers who want to \"hop on a quick call.\" It's relentless. And people are tired.Marketers often call this \"audience fatigue,\" blaming content overload. But after working with hundreds of leaders to build authentic authority, I've come to see it differently: it's not just content overload — it's trust fatigue.Trust fatigue is what happens when people stop believing. When every message feels like a sales pitch in disguise, people disengage — not just from brands, but from leaders who once earned their respect. So, in a world where trust is slipping and skepticism is rising, how do you become someone worth listening to?Trust moves from institutions to individualsOne study found that 79% of people trust their employer more than the media, the government, or nonprofits. That's huge. It means trust is no longer institutional — it's personal. People don't want another faceless brand talking at them. They want a real person who shows up with clarity, consistency and value.That's your opportunity. If you want to lead, you need to earn trust. And the good news? It starts with three moves.Related: Trust Is a Business Metric Now. Here's How Leaders Can Earn It.1. Be discoverableLet's get practical. Google yourself — what comes up? If it's outdated bios, scattered links, or worse — nothing — you've got work to do. Your digital presence is your first impression. When someone wants to vet you, they're not asking for your resume. They're looking you up.A strong LinkedIn profile is the first step. Make it sound like a leader, not a job seeker. Then, create a personal website that reflects who you are, what you stand for, and the people you serve. This is your platform.Next, give people a reason to trust you: thought leadership content — articles, interviews, podcasts — that showcase your ideas. If I can't find you, I can't follow you.2. Be credibleThe internet is full of opinions. What cuts through is proof. Credibility comes from evidence: media features, speaking gigs, client testimonials, books and bylines. These aren't vanity metrics — they're trust signals. They tell your audience: this person has earned a platform.You don't need to headline a TEDx talk tomorrow. Start small. Write a piece for your industry publication. Share a client win. Build momentum with real, earned signals of authority.And the data backs this up. A Gallup/Knight Foundation study found that nearly 90% of Americans follow at least one public figure for news or insight, more than brands, and sometimes more than the media itself.3. Be humanHere's where many leaders go wrong: they forget that trust isn't just about what you say — it's how you make people feel. You can have the slickest website and the most polished profile, but if your tone feels robotic or your content sounds like corporate filler, people will scroll right past.You don't need to spill your life story, but you do need to sound like a real person. Share lessons you've learned, not just what you're selling. Tell stories. Speak plainly. Be generous with your insights.I once shared a story about a career setback on stage, unsure of how it would land. It ended up being the thing people remembered — and the reason they reached out. Vulnerability built more trust than any polished pitch ever could.Related: How Talking Less and Listening More Builds Your Business Trust is the strategy — authority is the rewardMany leaders think, \"If I'm good at what I do, people will notice.\"They won't.In a world overflowing with content and short on attention, visibility matters. Credibility matters. And most of all, connection matters. You build trust gradually — through how you show up, what you say and how well it resonates with what your audience actually needs.So here's where to start: Audit your online presence as if you're a stranger seeing yourself for the first time.Share stories in your writing and speaking that make people feel something real.Post something this week that reflects what you believe, not what you're trying to sell.Lead with service. Speak with clarity. Build trust by showing up as yourself.Authority doesn't come from shouting the loudest. It comes from being the one people believe.",
