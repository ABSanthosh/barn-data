  "text": "Getting rid of taxes on your Social Security benefits might sound fabulous on paper, given that you’d have more money coming your way. But in practice, it could also throttle the system by speeding up the day that Social Security becomes insolvent. That doesn’t bode well for business owners and their workers who help fund the benefit.President Trump touted a tax-cutting treatise on the campaign trail that ranged from eliminating taxes on tips to taxes on Social Security benefits and even the federal income tax altogether. But research from Penn’s Wharton Budget Model finds that eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would mean the U.S. misses out on $1.5 trillion worth of federal revenue in the next decade. Plus, it would hike the federal deficit about seven percent by 2054. Currently, some 40% of Social Security recipients pay taxes on their benefits.“Simply no longer taxing Social Security benefits doesn’t really help the system at all,” says Mary Beth Franklin, a certified financial planner who has written about Social Security for decades. “In fact, it accelerates the depletion of the trust funds.”At the current rate, the Social Security trust funds — which hold money not needed in the current year to pay benefits and costs—are expected to run out of funds by 2035, but Penn argues that timeline could drop to the start of 2033 should Trump be successful in eliminating the tax this year. While Social Security is already in danger, it won’t ever go bust so long as Americans are working, according to Franklin. That’s because FICA taxes (which stands for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, or payroll tax) are earmarked to fund Social Security. Here’s how the accounting works: “Right now, the bulk of money that finances today’s Social Security benefits comes from FICA payroll taxes, but since about 2010 when we had another financial crisis that threw a lot of people into unemployment, and therefore they and their employers were not paying FICA taxes,” Franklin explains. “You had fewer people paying into the system and more people taking benefits out, so 2010 was the first year where FICA tax revenues alone were not sufficient to pay ongoing Social Security benefits.”In 2010, to help pay out benefits the nation started dipping into interest that was earned on Social Security trust funds. That happened until 2021, when FICA tax revenue, along with interest, still wasn’t sufficient to pay out benefits. So the government then started drawing down the principal of the Social Security trust fund, or dipping into the actual reserves itself, to help pay the benefit. Which might explain, in part, why you might be paying more in payroll taxes. This year, wages of up to $176,000 are subject to the FICA tax, up $10,000 from last year. And that’s the issue that bothers businesses the most, Franklin points out, since it dents their bottom line.This year, employers and their workers split the 15.3 percent FICA tax rate, though many solopreneurs and new businesses may foot the entire tax bill themselves. Those that do, however, qualify for a tax credit, at least, for the employer portion, according to Franklin. In the event that Social Security becomes insolvent, and Congress fails to act, the government would likely decrease Social Security benefits. Which is considered a third-rail issue, especially for seniors who have paid into the benefit for decades. And if businesses and workers still make their payroll contributions, there’s the chance that they could be contributing the same amount, if not more, and receive less of a benefit down the line.
