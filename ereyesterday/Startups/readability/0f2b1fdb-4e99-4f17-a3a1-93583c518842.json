  "text": "In 1953, my grandfather Jerry left Detroit on a three-day Greyhound bus trip to Seattle, where he started work at Boeing as an aircraft technician. A few years later, my mom followed. But Detroit stayed in my blood. Every summer, my mom sent me back to spend time with family, attend camp, and ride bikes in the street with my cousins.Diamond Spratling recalls similar stories growing up in Detroit: She spent her summers jumping rope and playing tag amid the smog that covered the Motor City before her father moved her family out of the city and to the crisp, clean air and green lawns of the suburbs. Her early exposure to environmental issues sparked a commitment to climate activism. She realized the climate narrative was often inaccessible to communities that were most affected, and in 2019, she created Girl + Environment (GPE) to change this reality. Through GPE, Diamond creates culturally relevant platforms that educate, engage, and empower women of color to lead in climate solutions, ensuring their voices are heard and valued in a space that has historically excluded them. She envisions a future where intersectional approaches to climate justice are the norm, with diverse leadership driving systemic change.Here’s more on how Diamond is bringing everyone into the conversation:What types of programs does GPE offer, exactly?The overarching nature of our work is to address the pressing need for diversity in the climate sector. Our Energy Ambassador Program empowers community members to advocate for clean energy solutions and influence decisions that directly affect their neighborhoods, leading to more equitable energy systems.The Healing Circles for Black and Brown Women Post-Climate Disaster focuses on supporting mental health and well-being in the aftermath of climate disasters. These sessions offer sound bath experiences, therapy access, and post-disaster care packages, addressing the emotional and psychological impacts of climate change.GPE’s Community Hub serves as a digital platform connecting Black and Brown women to climate justice resources, job opportunities, and educational materials.  What emerging climate trends or innovations are you most excited about, and why?I’m excited about the increased use of data-driven approaches, specifically GIS (geographic information systems). GIS allows us to visually map environmental injustices, such as areas disproportionately affected by pollution or climate disasters, helping communities and policymakers make informed decisions. This data makes inequities visible, providing powerful tools for advocacy and more targeted solutions.I’m also inspired by the growing recognition of intersectionality in climate conversations. It’s becoming more common to see climate action through a lens that considers race, gender, and socioeconomic status. This shift is critical, as marginalized communities are often the most affected by climate change but the least represented in decision-making processes. Normalizing intersectionality ensures that climate solutions are equitable and inclusive, addressing the needs of those who are most vulnerable.How do you measure success in your efforts to tackle climate change, especially given your community-centered work?We measure success through both qualitative and quantitative metrics that reflect our impact in empowering communities and tackling climate change.For business growth, we track the expansion of our programs, funding, the increase in community engagement, and the number of partnerships we build. Key indicators include growth in our membership base, successful grant applications, and participation in our programs. We also look at how many Black and Brown women are gaining leadership roles and career opportunities in the climate sector through our initiatives.For climate action, we assess how effectively our programs impact energy policy, drive community advocacy, and address climate justice issues. Success is measured by tangible outcomes, such as community feedback shaping energy policies, increased participation in clean energy solutions, and how well we support marginalized communities recovering from climate disasters. Ultimately, success means creating lasting, equitable change in climate justice while building a sustainable future for underrepresented communities.What is your advice for young leaders who want to become climate justice advocates? One of my favorite pieces of advice to share with young leaders is a quote that has guided me: “Do something today that your future self will thank you for tomorrow.” This has kept me going, not only in the environmental justice movement but in other aspects of life. It’s easy to get caught up in the challenges and lose sight of the impact you’re making, so I encourage them to remember that their efforts today will create lasting change, even if it’s not immediately visible.Another key piece of advice is to prioritize mental health. You cannot pour into your community, the climate movement, or anywhere else if you’re mentally exhausted. It’s essential to take care of yourself first to continue making an impact. Self-care and well-being are just as important as the work we do, and mental health should be a top priority in the environmental justice movement.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
