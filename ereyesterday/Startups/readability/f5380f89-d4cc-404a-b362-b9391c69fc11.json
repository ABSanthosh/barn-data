  "text": "Jensen Huang’s keynote speech at Nvidia’s GTC developers conference on Tuesday finished off with a bang—or a beep boop, rather—when he invited a tiny droid to join him on stage. The BDX, which may look familiar to Star Wars fans, was there to showcase a new partnership among Nvidia, Google DeepMind, and Disney Research. Together, the three powerhouses are working on a physics engine that aims to power realistic robots—and help Disney bring Star Wars-inspired droids to parks worldwide.The Nvidia CEO and co-founder announced the partnership yesterday during his keynote speech at the conference, together with the walking, beeping droid that Huang called “Blue.”“Can you imagine just now what you are looking at is complete real-time simulation? This is how we are going to train robots in the future,” he said.The adorable robot that Huang showcased contained two Nvidia computers, and was powered by the engine that Nvidia, Disney Research, and Google DeepMind are calling Newton. Newton is an open-source physics engine, designed to simulate movement and advance robotic learning.  Developers can use the engine to design robots for a variety of real-world applications, including managing more complex tasks with precision.For BDX, that could mean an increased ability to perceive and interact with the world, as well as more expressive reactions and better fine motor skills. For robot developers, it means more precise simulations of the way robots interact with the world, TechCrunch reported. And for Disney fans, that means more opportunities to interact with the quirky BDX droids, which the entertainment giant announced during tech conference SXSW will be coming to Disney parks and experiences worldwide, according to Axios.“The BDX droids are just the beginning. We’re committed to bringing more characters to life in ways the world hasn’t seen before, and this collaboration with Disney Research, NVIDIA, and Google DeepMind is a key part of that vision,” Walt Disney Imagineering Research and Development SVP Kyle Laughlin said in a statement.The preferred-rate application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is this Friday, March 21, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
