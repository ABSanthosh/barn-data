  "text": "Traditional pollsters have rated next week’s presidential election as a dead heat, but digital betting platforms are surging distinctly in Donald Trump’s favor. Online prediction markets have steamrolled into political forecasting, welcoming an influx of crypto and cash. Kalshi is among the many platforms benefitting from the craze. On Tuesday, Kalshi co-founder Luana Lopes Lara boasted that $100 million has been wagered on the contest between Kamala Harris and Trump. Kalshi’s other co-founder, CEO Tarek Mansour, also hyped a company milestone on LinkedIn: The platform surpassed Instagram on Apple’s App Store’s most popular downloads. Betting on political races hasn’t shown to have predictive validity and, for bettors, the platforms are lightly regulated. As November 5 nears, the money flooding into election markets will be closely watched by regulators. There is a definite risk of fallout, says Alan Jagolinzer, professor of financial accounting at Cambridge University. He references Polymarket, the biggest platform in the space, which is headquartered in Panama and deals exclusively in the cryptocurrency US Dollar Stablecoin (USDC). “There is also little transparency into whether the trading platforms carry enough cash reserves to pay account holders. We’ve seen several liquidity crashes on crypto exchanges,” he says, invoking FTX’s implosion two years ago. Analysts have shared similar liquidity concerns regarding Polymarket. Both Kalshi and Polymarket have Trump leading by roughly 66 percent to Harris’ 33 percent, which is not reflective of any scientific polling: it reflects the weight of money. A number of national polls on Wednesday had Harris leading the race. “Even averages that contain the heaviest-weighted Republican lean polls seem to indicate the probabilities of a Trump victory are within margin of error—suggesting roughly 50 percent probability,” Jagolinzer says. While betting on electoral outcomes isn’t new, the format popularized by Polymarket and Kalshi is still murky to regulators. The presidential election and its outcome will become a real-time test for regulators to gauge how or whether to intervene in the future.  “After the elections, the regulators will have a lot more data about how this market works,” says Hermine Wong, a former lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commision and a lecturer at UC Berkeley. “We may see a bunch of people who are newly minted millionaires based on their big bets in this election.” Or, we may see the opposite: “This may become the worst case scenario for the regulators in terms of harm to the public,” Wong argues.Appetites for election betting have increased partly due to the crypto industry’s new political lobbying agenda. Though it often exists in a legal gray area. Polymarket, which claims it processed $2.7 billion in election bets this year, has operated offshore since the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued the company in 2022. A Fortune report recently cited two independent studies that found Polymarket flooded with wash trades—which occur when an investor simultaneously buys and sells the same stock to manipulate the market. There is a suspicion that traders have been artificially inflating Trump’s prospects to enhance their likelihood of financial gain. OneWhale, the handle of an investor based in France, has placed $45 million USDC on a Trump victory.  Kalshi, which is headquartered in New York City, was earlier this month allowed by a Federal Appeals court to offer election betting using dollars. Klashi didn’t respond to an Inc. request or comment. Jagolinzer worries that the crypto community’s tendency to place risky bets might be what’s driving the excitement. Trump’s ascendancy on these platforms doesn’t reflect reality, he says. ​​”There are probably investors who wish this outcome to happen—betting on feelings—and who might not weigh other data in their investment decision.” After November 5, those investors may be suffering a crushing loss in more ways than one.",
