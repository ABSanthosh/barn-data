Agriculture \u0026 Energy The cutting-edge platform detects faults and maximises solar panel efficiency Spotted: The global push towards renewable energy is essential to combat climate change, yet many systems still underperform. Nearly 70 per cent of energy systems worldwide fall short of their operational potential due to inefficiencies, an area so important the IEA labels energy efficiency the “first fuel” in clean energy transitions. Addressing this challenge, a new AI-driven platform by Raicoon offers a way to maximise the efficiency of existing solar farms while cutting operational costs. This innovation, an autonomous operations centre (AOC) for solar photovoltaic (PV) plants, uses advanced AI to identify and address faults with near 100 per cent accuracy. By eliminating false alarms, the platform ensures only actionable data is flagged, significantly reducing maintenance costs while improving energy output by around six per cent. With operational expenses cut by 30 to 50 per cent, the solution offers both environmental and economic benefits. What sets this platform apart is its use of machine learning to continuously adapt and improve. The system sifts through the complex datasets generated by PV systems, delivering precise, automated decisions that minimise waste and maximise uptime. Unlike traditional solutions requiring manual intervention, the AOC operates independently, saving time and resources. Backed by €4 million in seed funding from leading climate and tech investors such as PUSH VC and Voltares, the innovation is set for global expansion, and the company was selected to join the Amazon Sustainability Accelerator earlier this year. New software upgrades and a self-service portal are on the horizon, while the company deepens its presence in the US and Asia-Pacific markets. According to the co-founders, this funding milestone underscores their vision of a future where renewable energy systems are smarter, more efficient, and fully autonomous.
