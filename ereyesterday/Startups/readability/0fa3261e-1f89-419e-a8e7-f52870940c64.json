Think donuts, cake, biscuits, brownies, and other sweet delights. Freakshakes have become huge in the food service industry.Small restaurateurs should consider capitalizing on the freakshake trend. Put this deliciously popular type of milkshake or dessert on your menu?What is a Freakshake?Want to create a Freakshake for your small restaurant? Fill a large glass jug with a luxury milkshake. Make this with ice cream and chocolate, strawberry or another flavored sauce. Then pile up goodies that look as delicious, striking and ‘sinful’ as possible.These goodies include cake, donuts, waffles, marshmallows, fruit, chocolate, and more, piled high to create an extravagant treat. Then, throw a handful of sweets on top for good measure.Want to know how far the freakshake phenomenon has gone? Well, some restaurants even offer savory freakshakes. They include ingredients like cheese and pulled pork, replacing donuts and waffles.Where Did the Freakshake Trend Originate?This high calorific dessert supposedly originated in Australia in 2015. A café in Canberra seems the likely creator of the drink.The savvy café owners in Canberra designed the freakshake for a very specific purpose. They were created to be “so ridiculous and over-the-top that people just had to take a photo of it before they ate it.”Cafes often decorate the edge of the glass with chocolate ganache to enhance the visual appeal of freakshakes.Thanks to the sharing power of social media, these oversized, ultra-sweet milkshakes quickly became a global sensation, with cafes, restaurants, and customers delighting in sharing their freakshakes with followers, and the more flamboyant, striking, and gastronomically sinful, the better.Creating the Perfect FreakshakeCreating the perfect freakshake requires a combination of high-quality ingredients, creativity, and attention to detail. Here are some tips to help you create a show-stopping freakshake:Start with a Rich Base: Begin with a rich and creamy ice cream base, such as chocolate or vanilla. This will form the foundation of your freakshake and ensure it’s delicious from the first sip to the last.Whipped Cream and Drizzles: Add a generous helping of whipped cream on top, and drizzle with chocolate sauce or salted caramel. These elements not only add flavor but also make the freakshake look irresistible.Pile High with Goodies: Pile high with edible creations, such as cookies, brownies, or marshmallow fluff. The more extravagant, the better! These toppings make your freakshake visually appealing and add a variety of textures.Variety of Textures and Flavors: Use a variety of textures and flavors to create a visually appealing and delicious freakshake. Consider adding crunchy elements like pretzels or nuts for an extra layer of excitement.Balance the Sweetness: Consider adding a sprinkle of sea salt or a pinch of cinnamon to balance out the sweetness. This can enhance the overall flavor profile and make your freakshake stand out.Get Creative: Don’t be afraid to get creative and experiment with different toppings and flavor combinations. The more unique and eye-catching, the more likely customers will want to share their experience on social media.By following these tips, you can create a freakshake that is sure to impress your customers and keep them coming back for more.Freakshakes and Social MediaThese brightly-colored edible creations are made to be photographed and shared around the world on social media, with the photo-sharing portal Instagram being a favorite channel for restaurants and freakshake-happy customers to share their freakshake images.A mere search of #freakshake on Instagram brings up more than 50,000 posts, each trying to outdo the other on the flamboyant stakes.Rather than being pictured toasting with a glass of bubbly or a pint of beer, social media users are posting pictures of themselves raising their freakshake glasses, accompanied with their location in the world and often the name of the establishment that has served them the delicious freakshake.The Opportunities of Freakshake Marketing to Attract More CustomersIt’s not uncommon for the biggest, boldest and most daring of freakshake posts to go viral.
