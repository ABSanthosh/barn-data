  "text": "Excellent experiences are what separate thriving companies from those that fade into irrelevance. At the end of the year, your bottom line doesn’t mean much if the experiences are sub-par. In today’s interconnected world, three elements can either elevate a company or destroy it: customer experience or CX, user experience or UX, and employee experience or EX. Get these right, and you’re on a strong path. Get them wrong, and you risk becoming just another cautionary tale. Over the years, I’ve seen countless companies fail despite strong financials simply because they mishandled the experience. The best brands understand that how customers experience the product and how employees feel about the workplace experience, can make or break a company’s future. Experiential Excellence Have you heard the famous Nordstrom tire story? A customer walked into a Nordstrom wanting to return a set of tires—yes, tires. The twist? If you’ve ever shopped at Nordstrom, you know they don’t even sell tires. And guess what? The employee accepted the return without a second thought, clearly showing how committed Nordstrom is to top-notch customer service. I first heard this story when I was in business school and this story has been shared countless times because it perfectly captures what a great customer experience looks like. But what makes this story so powerful is not just the customer service aspect—it’s the seamless integration of CX, UX, and EX. The trilogy of experiences The customer experience: At its core, CX is all about how customers feel about their interactions with your brand. It covers everything from marketing to post-purchase support to customer support. In the Nordstrom story, the CX was fantastic—the customer left feeling valued, even in a super unique situation. The user experience: While most folks may think of UX as just digital, it actually includes all user interactions with a product or service. It’s about the fullness of the experience, whether it’s in a brick-and-mortar setting or virtually. When customers feel understood and valued across all these touchpoints, they don’t just return—they practically become brand ambassadors. When you consider how competitive the business landscape is, a holistic approach to user experience isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s what separates the brilliant from the basic. The employee experience: EX is often overlooked, yet it’s vital for how employees feel about the journey within the company. EX acts as the throughline that connects employees to the company’s values and mission while also serving as a throughput that guides them through the entire employee lifecycle—from attraction and hiring to onboarding, development, engagement, progression, and retention. And when employee engagement is strong, it empowers team members to go above and beyond in prioritizing customer satisfaction. This positive EX directly boosts CX, creating a cycle of success that benefits everyone. The convergence of experiences When these three dimensions align, they create a powerful flywheel effect. Happy, well-engaged employees are more likely to go the extra mile for customers. Well-designed user interfaces and processes make it easier for everyone to interact with the company. Satisfied customers give positive feedback, which lifts employee morale and helps improve user experience. This convergence builds a stronger business model. Companies that excel in all three areas are better equipped to handle market ups and downs, economic challenges, and changing consumer preferences. They create a reservoir of goodwill that helps them through tough times. Designing for experience To get the experiential trifecta right, companies should: Prioritize empathy in all interactions, whether with customers, users, or employees. Invest in training and tools that empower employees to deliver amazing experiences. Continuously gather and act on feedback from everyone involved, from NPS to employee engagement surveys. Foster a culture that values experimentation and learning from both wins and losses. Ensure consistency across all touchpoints to create ‘one voice’ from digital platforms to physical spaces. In the experience-driven economy, the businesses that truly succeed will be those that understand the interconnectedness of CX, UX, and EX. They will be the Nordstroms of their industries—companies whose stories of exceptional experiences are told and retold, earning loyalty, driving engagement, and sustaining success. In the business world, products are easily replicated, and prices can be quickly undercut, experiences become the key differentiator. Maya Angelou put it best when she said, “I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” This perfectly captures the essence of CX, UX, and EX—they are all about creating a series of experiences that leave a lasting impression. When businesses can master this trilogy of experiences, they don’t just survive; they win.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
