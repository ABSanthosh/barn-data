So, you might be surprised to learn that while American workers receive approximately 12 days off each year, fewer than half of those workers—47 percent—plan to take all 12 days off. That’s, unfortunately, a lot of vacation time not being taken. “Taking time off is one of the best ways to become more creative, make better decisions and increase your focus,” says psychologist Susan Albers.
