  "text": "Connected devices are attracting serious funding. Oura, the company behind the health monitoring Oura Ring just raised $200 million at a more than $5 billion valuation. Executives say Oura plans to use the funding to expand its product offering and global footprint, explore possible acquisitions and invest in innovations including artificial intelligence and new form factors. “Our ambition is to be the transformative technology for preventative health care,” says Oura CEO Tom Hale.Oura’s series D round of funding included participation from Fidelity Management \u0026 Research company and glucose monitoring company Dexcom. The $200 million in funding brings Oura’s total valuation to $5.2 billion.Founded in 2013, Oura is known for its connected rings that use sensors and LEDs to monitor everything from skin temperature and breathing to heart rate variability, blood oxygen level and movement. Depending on the model and materials used, its rings cost anywhere from about $250 to $500 and require a $70 per year software subscription for optimal performance.Oura’s recent funding comes on the heels of significant growth for the company, which Hale says has been profitable for roughly 14 months and is on track to double its annual revenue to roughly $500 million for 2024. The company also reports it has sold more than 2.5 million rings. In the past year, Oura expanded both public and private partnerships, inking retail agreements with Amazon and Target, and partnering with the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), Air Force, and the Defense Innovation Unit.Artificial intelligence is nothing new for Oura, which Hale says has been relying on the machine learning underpinning its algorithms to process data since the company’s start. With the new funding, Hale says Oura is researching how to operate its large language model, Oura Advisor, on edge devices.“It would be really interesting to see if they could run the LLM at the edge for all the reasons we cited: performance, lack of latency, privacy, data security,” says Hale.Hale also mentioned that the company is looking into other preventative health wearable form factors beyond its signature ring. He cited Excom’s continuous glucose monitor as a “good example” of alternative sensors or devices that offer fresh health data, and teased one device that Oura would likely not touch.“We’re probably not going to develop a smart watch,” he says.Oura’s success is indicative of broader trends in the wearables and connected devices space. A report from SNS Insider cites growth drivers such as demand for personalized insights from health conscious consumers. A separate report on wearable categories through 2028 from IDC Research predicts that connected rings, which made up the one of the smallest categories in terms of units shipped in 2024, will experience the most rapid growth.Sensors like the kind embedded in wearables and other connected devices are one of the technological advancements that futurist and NYU Stern School of Business professor Amy Webb sees driving the “supercycle” of growth and disruption. Not only do they provide their users with interesting insight, they can provide large language models with the type of data needed to continue gathering insight into the world. Her predictions about the creation of personalized AI, informed by wearable sensor-generated data, echoes Hale’s vision of the future of preventative health, starting at a personalized level and growing to a societal one.“If we are successful at–and I don’t mean we Oura, I mean we the industry at large–trying to help people with technology around health, I think we can have a huge impact on population level health and society at large,” he says.",
