According to a press release, this “powerhouse alliance” is “built on both brands’ shared focus on disruption and product innovation.”“From day one, my vision for Rhode has been to make essential skin care and hybrid makeup you can use every day,” said Bieber, who made Inc.’s 2024 Female Founders list, in the press release. “Just three years into this journey, our partnership with E.l.f. Beauty marks an incredible opportunity to elevate and accelerate our ability to reach more of our community with even more innovative products and widen our distribution globally.”The deal includes $600 million in cash, $200 million in “newly issued shares of E.l.f. Beauty common stock issued to existing equity holders of Rhode,” and the potential to earn an additional $200 million based on Rhode’s growth over the next three years after closing, per the press release. The companies expect to close in Q2 of 2026.Bieber founded Rhode in 2022 along with married couple Michael D. Ratner, who serves as the brand’s co-executive chairman, and Lauren Ratner, who serves as its president and chief brand officer.
