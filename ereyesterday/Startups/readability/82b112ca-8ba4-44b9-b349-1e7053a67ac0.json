Here's how it works:Seamless transactions: Clients easily buy, finance, and resell shares of luxury homes through Pacaso's intuitive platform.Turnkey ownership: Pacaso handles maintenance, scheduling, and furnishing; owners simply enjoy their vacation homes.Maximized value: Homes that once sat empty 90% of the year now stay occupied nearly year-round, benefiting owners and local economies.And the demand for their services and expertise is real.
