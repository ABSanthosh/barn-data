  "text": "It’s been a week since Andy Byron, then the CEO of Astronomer, and the company’s chief people officer were caught canoodling on a kiss cam at a Coldplay concert near Boston, and the gossip, memes, and jokes about the incident are showing no signs of slowing down.For Cincinnati-based Astronomer, the incident has made the startup in the data and AI space a familiar name, albeit not in the way it would hope. (Co-founder Pete DeJoy, who took over as interim CEO, said on LinkedIn “The spotlight has been unusual and surreal for our team and, while I would never have wished for it to happen like this, Astronomer is now a household name.”) Coldplay is topping streaming charts again. But the oddest winner of this entire fiasco could be a brand that was abandoned in 2001: JumboTron.The JumboTron name is everywhere: in headlines, in social-media posts, in comments. Even the name of the song being played during that now-viral moment was “The Jumbotron Song.” But Sony, which came up with and trademarked the term JumboTron, isn’t seeing any of the benefits. The company, which introduced the world’s first giant display in 1985, stopped manufacturing devices under the name in 2021 and the trademark became genericized.Today, there are plenty of companies with the word Jumbotron in their name, such as Jumbotron Screen and the Mini Jumbotron Company. Others, like Nevco, use it in their advertising and marketing. And there are a host of other display companies whose products (technically called LED video displays) are referred to colloquially as jumbotrons (though not by the companies themselves).The generic graveyardJumbotron (now minus the capital T) is one of a large number of former trademarked words that have since become generic parts of the national vocabulary. Aspirin, for instance, was originally a trademark of Bayer, but it became a generic term in 1921. Trampoline was once exclusive to the Griswold-Nissen Trampoline \u0026 Tumbling Company. And videotape was, at one time, a trademark of Ampex Corp., which introduced the video tape recorder in 1955.Other examples of genericized or abandoned trademarks include dumpster, super glue, linoleum, dry ice, and, until two years ago, Taco Tuesday.While Sony might be out of the jumbotron market, several big-name companies have stepped into the space. Samsung is a prominent manufacturer for stadiums and public spaces. Mitsubishi’s Diamond Vision has been making large-scale video walls for venues since the 1980s. And display systems from Brookings, South Dakota-based Daktronics are found in venues around the country, including Gillette Stadium, where the infamous kiss-cam controversy took place.None of these companies have attempted to capitalize on the virality of the moment on social media. (Daktronics told Inc.: “The display used for the concert wasn’t a Daktronics display. While we have permanent displays installed at Gillette Stadium, this circle display was brought in for the concert and is not our technology.”) That makes sense, in a way. While the internet at large has been having fun with the situation, possible adultery and scandal are hardly things most companies would want to be tied to (with some exceptions).“While it’s certainly a viral moment, there’s a level of discomfort associated with it,” says David Schweidel, a professor at Emory University’s Goizueta Business School. “No manufacturer wants to associate itself with a moment that essentially shows us how much the world has become a panopticon society. These large screens create shared experiences for everyone at massive event venues. This particular incident isn’t necessarily the type of experience the brands want to endorse.”Ironically, the JumboTron wasn’t initially meant to be a screen that displayed kiss cams or on-field action. The first JumboTrons were used solely to display game scores. When stadiums began using them to replay big on-field moments, though, the path was set. Improvements in display technology over the course of the past few years have made the displays nearly as crisp as home TVs, which is how the world was so easily able to identify the individuals embracing when Coldplay’s Chris Martin launched into “The Jumbotron Song.”Update, July 23, 2025: This article has been updated with a quote from Daktronics.
