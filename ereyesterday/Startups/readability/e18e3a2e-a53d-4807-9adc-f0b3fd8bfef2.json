Manufacturing materials such as cement, steel, and aluminium, as well as the construction and demolition of buildings all contribute to the industry’s enormous carbon footprint. Now, engineers at MIT may have a greener alternative.Using 3D printing technology developed by MIT spin-out Evenline, the research team printed multi-layer bricks made from recycled glass bottles, which could serve as an effective replacement to existing high-carbon construction materials. During mechanical testing, the bricks – which are made in the shape of a figure of eight –were shown to withstand pressures similar to that of a concrete block. The prototype glass bricks have two round pegs, similar to those on a LEGO brick, which allow the bricks to interlock and be assembled into larger structures. Kaitlyn Becker, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at MIT explains the advantages: “We’re taking glass and turning it into masonry that, at the end of a structure’s life, can be disassembled and reassembled into a new structure, or can be stuck back into the printer and turned into a completely different shape. All this builds into our idea of a sustainable, circular building material.” The team have been looking for ways to further strengthen the blocks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the technology, the researchers aim to build larger temporary structures like pavilions.
