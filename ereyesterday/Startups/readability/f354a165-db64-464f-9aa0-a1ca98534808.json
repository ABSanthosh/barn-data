  "text": "You satisfy your customers, but can you satisfy our curiosity? With Emily Bach, Customer Support Team Lead at Mangomint. Please tell us a little bit about your company and what you do there. I‚Äôm a Customer Support Team Lead at Mangomint ‚Äì a SaaS company that supports businesses in the health and wellness industry. What word or phrase in customer service jargon should be retired? ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a great question!‚Äù Which celebrity would be really great at your job, and why? Keanu Reeves. He has proven time and time again ‚Äì even if not being watched ‚Äì that he has empathy for others and is a kind person. What‚Äôs the most valuable thing that working in customer service has taught you? When to move fast and slow, while maintaining responsiveness. Speed can be imperative in urgent situations, and problem solving can require more communication and patience. Describe the essence of great customer service using only three words. Trustworthy. Accurate. Empathetic. Which movie robot would you choose as your AI sidekick, and why? WALL-E. He had first principles thinking, and selflessly did what was best for all. What can you do that a bot will never be able to replicate? Meet our customers at a very specific level by understanding their full background with industry and product expertise. I‚Äôm sure one day bots will also be able to jump on a quick call, but that human connection is extremely important in our industry. It builds the trust our customers look for in a software. What‚Äôs the most embarrassing thing you‚Äôve ever said/done to a customer? Well, one time my cat jumped on my keyboard and typed a bunch of random nonsense. We were both quick to laugh about it though! Do you identify more with the title ‚Äúcustomer support,‚Äù ‚Äúcustomer service,‚Äù ‚Äúcustomer success,‚Äù or ‚Äúcustomer experience,‚Äù and why? That is hard to answer. Our team offers support and we‚Äôre invested in our customers‚Äô success. We strive to make their experience the best we can, whether that involves hopping on a quick call to help them with their hardware (support), helping them find value in features they are not using (success), or making sure their feedback is directly sent to the product team (experience). What‚Äôs the one piece of advice you would give to your peers in the customer service industry? Stay focused on taking care of those who reach out for help. If you remain passionate about helping those who come to you, you will feel fulfilled. What‚Äôs the worst customer service you‚Äôve ever experienced? For me, it‚Äôs any time I have to call into a bot and repeat myself 100 times to get to where I need to go. I know that‚Äôs pretty common. Weirdly enough, you‚Äôd think we‚Äôd have resolved that pain point by now but we have not. What‚Äôs your greatest productivity hack? Put your head down and drink some tea for 15 minutes. Once you feel that buzzing in your head from being busy, it‚Äôs just time for a little break. You‚Äôll come back in full force. What book are you reading at the moment? Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. It may not be industry-related, but it sure can get you thinking about what humanity means. If customer service was an Olympic sport, what would be the main event? Sprint hurdles ‚Äì getting through things quickly, thoughtfully, and, most importantly, with limited faults. What‚Äôs the best thing a customer has ever said to you? Our customers are so kind, but my favorite is always, ‚ÄúIf you are ever in town, let us treat you to a service.‚Äù What gif best describes your mental state right now? Where do you get your support leadership news? Support leaders at Intercom have been great with insights! I also follow certain folks on other platforms. Any type of leader can provide insight, so I like to keep my mind open! What do you wish people knew about working in customer service? You tend to wear many hats, regardless of whether you are just starting out or you‚Äôre a lead/manager. Every day comes with many problems to solve and they are not always the same. It is certainly not a boring job! If you wrote a book about your experiences in customer service, what would the title be? ‚ÄúCommand K: Shortcuts to a Happy Customer.‚Äù What‚Äôs the strangest thing a customer has asked you? Honestly, nothing super strange. But I did get a very sincere invitation for some cosmetic surgery from a client I helped out during a crisis they had. It wasn‚Äôt the software, it was very internal, but we were able to make sure everything was good. What‚Äôs your most used emoji in customer chats? ‚ú® Conversation closed‚Ä¶ for now üòè",
