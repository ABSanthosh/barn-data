Learn More San Francisco AI startup Anthropic has more up its sleeve than the new Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 large language models (LLMs) announced last week — today it has unveiled two major updates for its similarly named Claude AI chatbot: a new conversational voice mode available on its mobile apps in the Apple App Store (iOS devices, iPhones) and Google Play Store (Android devices). In addition, the AI startup that rivals OpenAI (and was formed by some of its defectors) is also extending web search to all users on free plans. These updates aim to make Claude more versatile and accessible to a wider audience. “Early implementation of voice but something that I’ve already found very fun and useful,” wrote Alex Albert, Anthropic’s Head of Claude Relations, on the social network X. “Let us know how you like it (the good and the bad) so we can make it much better in the future!” However, Claude’s conversational voice interface is limited to English for now, and there has not yet been mention of API support for the feature, nor web support — meaning it is restricted to individual mobile app users for now. Hitting OpenAI where it hurts The new Claude voice mode is said to be rolling out over the next few weeks to all mobile app users, according to Anthropic. While rival OpenAI has offered a conversational voice mode on ChatGPT since late 2023 and upgraded it significantly several times, Claude’s new conversational mode brings it up to parity and then some, offering features OpenAI does not. As shown in a promotional video posted on X, users of Claude’s mobile apps can now ask via the conversational voice interface for Claude to check their Google Calendars, Gmail, and Google Docs for specific information that the chatbot will summarize and read back to them audibly, including upcoming appointments and presentation materials. While the conversational interface and web search are available to users of Claude’s free tier, the integration with outside apps and tools is available only to paying subscribers to Claude Pro ($20 per month or $214.99 per year up-front) and Claude Max ($100 monthly per user). As with OpenAI, users can choose from differing voice options — in Claude’s case, they’re known as “Buttery, Airy, Mellow, Glassy and Rounded” — each with distinct tones, accents and conversational quirks. Voice conversations generate full transcripts and voice mode summaries. Additionally, Claude provides visual notes that capture key insights from each discussion, giving users an easy way to review and revisit important points. Seamless transitions between text and voice, plus rich media support One notable feature of voice mode is the ability to switch seamlessly between text and voice interactions without losing conversation context. This flexibility supports different user preferences and use cases. Beyond spoken dialogue, voice mode also handles rich media interactions. Users can discuss documents, images and complex information using voice commands while Claude maintains the conversational flow. This allows for deeper engagement with content and easier access to insights. For Pro Plan users and above, voice mode also integrates personal information sources—such as emails, calendar events and documents—alongside real-time web search results. This combination of data sources offers a more comprehensive and actionable conversational experience. Web search for all In parallel with the voice mode rollout, Anthropic has expanded access to web search by making it available to all users on free plans. This new capability enables Claude to draw on real-time internet data, offering fresher and more accurate responses to questions about breaking news, market trends and other dynamic topics. Web search for free plans adds to Claude’s growing toolkit of integrations and knowledge resources, making it easier for users to get relevant answers and stay current. Anthropic’s broader vision Anthropic notes that voice technology isn’t new territory for the company. Beyond the speech-to-text features in Claude’s mobile apps, Anthropic also powers Amazon’s Alexa+ and Otter AI’s transcription services. These experiences inform the development of the new voice mode and its potential to integrate with other parts of the user’s digital life. These updates join a broader suite of enhancements to Claude, including the launch of Claude 4, integrations with Google Workspace, and expanded research capabilities. A push toward more versatile user interactivity Anthropic highlighted the ease with which users can start a voice conversation and ask Claude to summarize calendar entries or search for documents—demonstrating the platform’s expanded capabilities. Anthropic has also shared media assets to provide additional resources for users interested in learning more about the updates. With the rollout of voice mode in beta and web search now included for free plans, Anthropic continues to broaden the functionality and accessibility of Claude’s AI services. These updates represent another step forward in making conversational AI more adaptable and relevant to users’ daily tasks.
