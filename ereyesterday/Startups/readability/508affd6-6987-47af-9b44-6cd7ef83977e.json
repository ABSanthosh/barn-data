From needing last-minute gifts to home-cooked meals gone awry, it's important to know where you can turn in times of a kitchen mishap or broken present.This year, the holidays fall midweek, and many businesses appear to be staying open on Christmas Eve (Tuesday, December 24) and closing on Christmas Day (Wednesday, December 25) — though check with your local stores before heading out.Here's what's open and closed this Christmas holiday. ShoppingBoth Target and Walmart are open on Christmas Eve (until 8 p.m. and 6 p.m., respectively) and closed on Christmas Day.Macy's and Kohl's are open on Christmas Eve until 7 p.m. and closed on Christmas Day.
