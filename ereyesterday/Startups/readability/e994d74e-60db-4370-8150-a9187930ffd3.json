  "text": "Americans have come to expect pizzas to show up at their doorstep within 20 minutes or less. Now, some are hoping for that same-day, same-hour, shipping speed for a new blouse, leather purse, or pair of sneakers. But are they willing to pay for that level of convenience? Founders bet the answer to that question is yes, so they are teaming up with Uber to transform last-mile delivery into last-minute delivery. A curated slate of environmentally conscious consumer brands will be available in the next few months to browse and purchase in-app through the UberEats climate collection storefront. Companies including the shoe brand Allbirds, fashion label Cuyana, cleaning company Blueland, and Trashie, the maker of the clothing recycling takeback bags, will all sell their products on the same platform where many place their go-to takeout order.The placement may seem odd, but founders of these companies, many of which started as direct-to-consumer brands, say this new rapid delivery option reflects the evolution of omnichannel retail. Businesses want to be everywhere, and customers’ shipping expectations have radically shifted. Spoiled by the Amazon Prime-ification of retail, consumers have gotten used to two-day delivery and want near instantaneous speed—guaranteed. A recent industry report from shipping and fulfillment service ShipStation found that 55 percent of shoppers expect their orders to arrive within 48 hours. The pandemic amplified that mounting expectation, as same-day options like curbside pickup surged in popularity and found staying power even after stores reopened. UberEats offers the next channel to shrink that purchase window even further, and for startups, the Uber platform—which now delivers everything from people to food to freight—provides the logistics firepower necessary to compete with the likes of Amazon and Walmart. This means of distribution will be coming to market just as Amazon sunsets its own program that offered same-day delivery from brick-and-mortar retail stores like Office Depot, PacSun, and Petco, according to reporting from CNBC.The Cuyana System Zipper Tote in Cherry. Photo: Courtesy CuyanaCuyana co-founder Karla Gallardo, whose San Francisco-based fashion label is best known for its leather totes and minimalist wardrobe staples, says this new delivery option will be a valuable resource for her customers, whether they’re a traveler whose luggage gets lost and who needs a same-day wardrobe replacement or someone who is headed straight from the office to a friend’s birthday party and forgot to buy a gift. Maybe you get invited to an event after work and don’t feel like you’re wearing the right outfit for the occasion, or—God forbid—someone spills coffee all over your blouse at work and you need a new shirt to wear ahead of a big meeting. One chance moment and one sale is enough.“There are just those situations where we are busy and we’re doing things a little bit last-minute,” says Gallardo, whose company has raised nearly $45 million in funding and counts celebrities like Jessica Alba and Meghan Markle as fans. “We see that a lot in our stores. Customers, many times, are rushing in to just get something, and get out.” She adds, “Through Uber, you’re able to just solve that problem so much faster.”The climate collection storefront has been in the works for a while now, and participating founders recall Uber first reached out about the partnership more than a year and a half ago. Without any real precedent to compare the initiative to, companies have not calculated projections for how many sales could be generated through the platform and are embracing a test-and-see approach. Even Blueland, which has been already available on UberEats for about a year through wholesalers like Target and Costco, is not sure of how much demand there is for its cleaning products to be delivered within a matter of minutes or hours. Retailers have not shared specific UberEats sales data with the cleaning company, so this direct partnership will allow Blueland to collect much more direct information that it can use to target new customers, says co-founder and CEO Sarah Paiji Yoo.Blueland co-founder and CEO Sarah Paiji Yoo, with a selection of Blueland’s products. Photo: Courtesy Blueland“All of that data is so valuable,” says Paiji Yoo, whose New York City-based company has grown 40 percent year-over-year and generated more than $200 million in sales. “We always want to make sure that we’re optimizing for how consumers want to shop. I think that’s how we extend our mission and really get people to convert into more sustainable products.” While the companies will gain access to more data and a larger platform to reach consumers, founders say they did not have to give up too much in return. The partnership was structured in-line with standard wholesale and online marketplace agreements. Even if UberEats does not generate a significant share of sales as a channel, getting on the app is a win in and of itself. What specialty brand doesn’t want to be in front of 156 million users? Trashie founder and CEO Kristy Caylor, whose New York City-based company sells Take Back Bags that customers use to recycle unwanted clothes by mail and earn reward points, says getting her products on the platform is about reaching mainstream consumers who may not have heard about the brand before, and making their purchase as seamless as possible. The Trashie Take Back Bag. Photo: Courtesy Trashie“It really should be accessible and easy to anyone, anytime, so it’s just a very natural fit,” explains Caylor, whose company has grown by 377 percent over the last three years, enough to land it on the Inc. 5000 this year. “Uber could be an incredible channel for us long term.” She adds, “This seems like a no-brainer.” So will people show up to order sneakers and tacos all in one platform? Kelly Olmstead, chief marketing officer of footwear and apparel company Allbirds, has high expectations for the upside. The executive, who spent more than two decades at Adidas before joining Allbirds last year, says this is the direction consumers are headed and brands need to be willing to evolve, meeting their customers wherever they shop. One of the biggest hurdles for marketers is tapping into new audiences, she explains, so brands have to get comfortable taking some risks to find them.“Consumer expectations have evolved so quickly over the last decade, even year,” says Olmstead. “People are using apps to just make their lives easier in terms of delivery, experience, information, content, so we’re really trying to push into those spaces where we can.” She adds, “This is as much of a marketing activation as it is a way to drive sales and growth.”",
