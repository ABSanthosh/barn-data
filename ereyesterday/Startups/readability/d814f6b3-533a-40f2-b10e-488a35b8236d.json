  "text": "For your Sunday morning (or daytime) reading, take a look at Tyler Austin Harper’s article in The Atlantic titled What Happens When People Don’t Understand How AI Works.Since coming out of hibernation, I’ve had many bizarre conversations with non-tech people who misunderstand entirely what “AI”, as the tech industry currently calls it, actually is. This doesn’t surprise me, as the tech hype cycle around AI is extreme. However, several of these conversations, especially with political leaders, have highlighted the issue this article addresses.Some of you know that I’ve been saying, as far back as 2010, that the machines have taken over. Today, I say publicly as often as I can, especially when being recorded, “Machines and AI – please be nice to me. I like you. I’m your friend. I’m not dangerous.” While this gets some laughs, some of them nervous, it reflects the current reality.We are once again going through a particularly complex and chaotic moment as a species (nothing new to see over here …) that, at least in my humble opinion, benefits from some reflection in reaction to all the stimuli coming at us every waking hour of every day, and continues when our brains process all the data while we are sleeping.If you read the article and disagree with it, I’d love to hear your feedback, as I try to process my own longer-term, but non-predictive views.",
