  "text": "The renaissance of workplace attire is underway, and L’eggs wants in. The 55-year-old hosiery brand soared during the ’70s and ’80s, when pantyhose were a staple for office outfits. But eventually, bare legs took over, athleisure became business casual, and remote work made anything other than sweatpants feel like a sin.So why would tights make a comeback now? Because they’re timeless, according to newly appointed creative director Cami Téllez, who knows a few things about challenging assumptions.The entrepreneur co-founded underwear brand Parade in her Columbia dorm room in 2018, and it garnered a cult following of Gen-Z shoppers on social media as she quickly ascended the ranks of young-founder success stories. Roughly five years later, she sold it to Miami Beach-based Ariela \u0026 Associates International.Since then, she’s spent her time quietly crafting another intimate story.Westport, Connecticut-based private equity firm Windsong Global began talks for acquiring L’eggs from HanesBrands in 2023. Founder and chairman William “Bill” Sweedler, who Téllez refers to as a business mentor, close friend, and “iconic private equity investor,” approached her shortly after her exit from Parade. Their partnership neatly unfolded from there.“Everybody has a L’eggs story, whether it’s their mom wearing [them], or they have memories of the iconic egg,” Téllez says, in reference to the tights’ signature egg-shaped packaging. “I really felt that this brand had this timeless legacy that coincides with this growing interest in the category across all generations, which was really exciting. So when Bill asked me to be the executive creative director and board adviser, I was like, ‘Hell yes.’ “Archival L’eggs advertisements, featuring the signature egg-shaped packaging.

She says that L’eggs has an 80-percent recognition rate among women over 40, but her goal is to capture younger consumers with nostalgia. Social media is where she’s starting.The L’eggs Instagram account recently deleted everything from its profile and cleared its following. It began teasing its relaunch a day early with collages of print ads from the ’80s. On October 30, it posted a new campaign, which integrates some of its vintage inspiration.An image from L’eggs’s current campaign. Photo: Courtesy L’eggsAside from increasing consumer awareness among Gen-Z consumers, L’eggs president Charlie Nichols says product innovation and distribution are the main areas of focus for its rebrand. “We’re starting with tights because it’s our DNA, but throughout 2025 we’ll bring our solutions innovation into shapewear, leggings, socks, and beyond,” he says. The brand plans to relaunch online at Target, Kohl’s, Lulu’s, and Amazon this fall before rolling out in 1,800 Target stores in spring 2025. “We envision a world where every store you walk into—drug, food, mass—you’re able to find stylish, sustainable, fashion basics at a price you love,” he adds.L’eggs is indeed still kicking, according to Téllez: “The brand that was designed 55 years ago still has legs.”",
