  "text": "Apple has had a rough go of its attempt to build large language model capabilities into Siri, the company’s long-beleaguered voice assistant.Back at WWDC, Apple’s developer conference, the company “showed off” a number of features, including the ability for Siri to be contextually aware of your personal information, as well as what is on your screen. This would be a game-changer, and it’s an example of the type of thing only Apple could do.Except, Apple now says that it will take “longer than we thought” to deliver those features. On Friday, Apple released a statement to a small number of outlets that the most Siri features it touted at last year’s WWDC are delayed indefinitely. Here’s the statement in its entirety:“Siri helps our users find what they need and get things done quickly, and in just the past six months, we’ve made Siri more conversational, introduced new features like type to Siri and product knowledge, and added an integration with ChatGPT,” Apple’s spokesperson Jacqueline Roy. “We’ve also been working on a more personalized Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps. It’s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.”John Gruber, who was one of those who received the statement, published a scathing piece on Wednesday chronicling how Apple got to this point, and I think he makes an important point: “Less noticed, but to my mind the more impressive achievement, is that over the last three decades, the company also accumulated an abundant reserve of credibility. When Apple showed a feature, you could bank on that feature being real. When they said something was set to ship in the coming year, it would ship in the coming year. In the worst case, maybe that “year” would have to be stretched to 13 or 14 months. You can stretch the truth and maintain credibility, but you can’t maintain credibility with bullshit. And the “more personalized Siri” features, it turns out, were bullshit.” The real problem isn’t that Apple is so far behind in AI, though that’s not great. It’s also not that Apple talked about products or features that weren’t ready to ship. It’s that it talked about them as if they were a lot more real than they obviously were—or are. The problem is that Apple put one of its most-liked and most-trusted executives, Craig Federighi, on camera to make promises that the company can’t deliver.The Apple Intelligence promiseApple showed a number of examples of how Siri with Apple Intelligence will take advantage of personal context. For example, it said you’ll be able to ask Siri to update a contact’s address based on it appearing in an iMessage. Or, you’ll be able to tell Siri to add a photo that you’re looking at to a Note.Then, it showed ads touting Apple Intelligence, including features that didn’t exist. Apple just pulled an ad from YouTube that featured Bella Ramsey asking Siri to help her remember the name of someone she met at a cafe. The ad shows Siri pulling that information from her calendar. None of those were actually possible at the time—and still aren’t possible today. But, when Apple talked about them at WWDC and in briefings, developers and members of the media took them at their word. Apple got the benefit of the doubt, despite the fact the company didn’t demonstrate any of those features (which, as Gruber points out, should have been a huge red flag). The only improvement to Siri so far is that when it doesn’t know how to answer a query, it’ll just send it to ChatGPT.Back in December, I wrote that the single most important thing Apple needed to do this year was deliver on its big promises about Siri with Apple Intelligence. “Apple has to get this right this coming year because it’s so far behind,” I wrote. “But, more importantly, because it made a promise. As a company, you have to keep your promises.”Apple is held to a higher standard.Look, there is no question that people hold Apple to a different standard. When Amazon held its Alexa Plus event a few weeks ago, there were plenty of things it demoed that I’m not sure anyone thinks will be real any time soon, but that’s Amazon. It’s the company that—back in 2020—showed off a surveillance drone that flies through your home. At some point, I think that product was on the Ring website, but was made available by “invitation only.” Now, it’s nowhere to be found at all.My point is that no one thought Amazon was really going to sell you this drone camera thing. And, when Amazon doesn’t ship some strange idea about a product, no one really cares, because that’s just what Amazon does.Apple, on the other hand, has historically been incredibly reluctant to talk about anything it wasn’t ready to deliver. That isn’t to say it hasn’t made mistakes, but the company just doesn’t say much about its future plans.Somewhere along the way, it changed that stance when it came to Siri, either because it felt the pressure of being behind, or because some people were overly confident it would be able to deliver. The problem is, it didn’t deliver, and it’s still behind.Why trust mattersAs a general rule, you only get to that once before you burn the benefit of the doubt. Back in January, I wrote that if Apple doesn’t ship the “smarter Siri” that it showed off at WWDC, it would be more detrimental to the company than if it didn’t ship an iPhone this year. I’m sure from a purely financial perspective, that isn’t true. The iPhone is the most popular consumer product in the history of mankind. It’s the reason Apple is the largest company in the world.Of course, since Friday, Apple’s stock price has dropped by 11 percent, and its market cap has lost $400 billion of value. Part of that is because Apple just admitted that it’s going to take longer than it thought to deliver on what is surely its most important initiative at this point. I think it’s also because everyone believed Apple when it said it could deliver, and that trust—it turns out—was misplaced.When Apple said it was going to deliver a series of incredibly compelling artificial intelligence features, people took the company at its word. It had earned that trust over years of keeping its promises. If you can’t trust a company’s executives when they talk about the features they are building, and if you can’t trust the company’s spokespeople when they give you demos, that’s a real problem.It also serves as a cautionary tale for every leader. Trust, I’ve written many times, is your most valuable asset.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The extended application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is this Friday, March 14, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
