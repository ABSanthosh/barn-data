This brings a pressing problem of excessive battery waste, with 242,000 tonnes of portable batteries sold in 2021 in the EU alone. Swiss cleantech Perovskia Solar has developed a pioneering solution to this challenge: high-efficiency, portable perovskite solar cells designed to power our devices both indoors and outdoors.  As IoT devices continue to proliferate in industrial and consumer settings, their energy needs are increasing. Perovskia’s innovation offers a complete alternative to traditional batteries, harvesting ambient light with lightweight cells that are manufactured using an inkjet printing method. The technology is based on six years of research at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa), and is now primed for release to the global market. The aim is that Perovskia’s cells will reduce the reliance on single-use batteries, cut waste, and enable self-sustaining IoT devices. “Perovskia technology is based on a unique blend of perovskite chemistry and strong expertise in inkjet production processes” CEO and Founder Anand Verma explained to Springwise. This provides a solution that is scalable at the same time as being aesthetically versatile. The startup has already attracted the attention of major players in the IoT industry who are looking for custom-designed solar cells for devices. Perovskia has secured over 10 early adopters and recently closed on $2.4 million in seed funding from a global coalition of angel investors and early-stage funds. The company’s immediate focus is scaling up production, with an ambitious target of reaching one million printed cells by the end of 2024, and up to 0.5 million finished devices by 2025 year end. To meet the growing demand, Perovskia is also working on automating its backend processes and quality control. Verma told Springwise: “our initial focus is on Industrial IoT (…) Our grand vision is to enable solar on every device.” Written By: Oscar Williams 14th October 2024 Email: info@perovskia.solar Website: perovskia.solar Contact: perovskia.solar/contact-us",
