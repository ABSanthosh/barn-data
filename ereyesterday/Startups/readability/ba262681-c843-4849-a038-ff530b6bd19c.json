  "text": "We’re slowly getting more information about Thinking Machines Lab, the secretive new startup from former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati. According to a new report from The Information, the company will reportedly specialize in creating customized AI models designed with a company’s specific KPIs, or key performance indicators, in mind. Murati joined OpenAI in 2016 and served as one of the company’s senior leaders, and was briefly named the company’s CEO in 2023, when OpenAI’s board fired and then rehired Sam Altman. She left OpenAI in September 2024, and has spent the ensuing months recruiting talent from top AI firms to work at her mysterious startup and raising $2 billion at a $10 billion valuation. Now, the report from The Information is shedding some light on the business model for Murati’s new company. According to the report, Thinking Machines Lab will develop AI solutions for businesses that are customized around an organization’s KPIs. Citing people who have spoken to Murati, the Information reported that Thinking Machines Lab will use reinforcement learning (RL), a process of AI training in which a model attempts to complete a task over and over again and is rewarded or penalized based on the outcome. Essentially, it’s a method that enables AI models to learn from direct experience. But creating advanced AI models is an incredibly expensive and time-consuming prospect. To quickly get a product to market, Murati is reportedly hoping to leverage existing open-source models, which do not require an API to use. According to The Information, Murati has told investors that her plan is to selectively “pluck” specific layers from these open-source models and combine them. To understand what that means, it helps to know about the structure of an AI system like ChatGPT. When you send a message to an AI app like ChatGPT, your message travels through a neural network’s many layers of virtual neurons. Each layer has a purpose, from detecting specific patterns to deepening the AI model’s understanding of your text, and producing the response. Murati reportedly believes that by combining specific layers, her company can create capable AI models much more efficiently than larger rivals. It’s still unknown what tasks Thinking Machines Lab’s “RL for businesses,” as investors are reportedly calling it (the “RL” is in reference to “reinforcement learning”), will be best suited to, or how much it will cost to develop a customized model. The company is also reportedly working on a consumer-level product, which could be comparable to ChatGPT. The Information’s report also revealed that Murati was one of the many AI startup founders who has recently met with Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, who is currently on a spending spree to bolster Meta’s AI ambitions through investments, talent poaching, and acquisitions. Murati and Zuckerberg’s talks reportedly “didn’t get far.”The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is this Friday, June 27, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
