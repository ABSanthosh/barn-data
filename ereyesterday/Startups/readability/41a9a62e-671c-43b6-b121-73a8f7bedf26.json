  "text": "Venus Aerospace just took one giant leap toward hypersonic travel. The Houston-based startup successfully completed the first U.S. flight test of an exotic new type of engine, capable of enabling aircraft to travel four to six times the speed of sound—and possibly up to nine times the speed of sound. Hypersonic travel indicates travel at five times or greater than the speed of sound, while supersonic speeds indicate anything that exceeds the speed of sound, or Mach 1.  “We’ve spent the last four years testing here in Houston, but it’s one thing for an engine to fire on a test stand. It’s very different to put it into a flight-ready state,” says Sassie Duggleby, CEO and co-founder of Venus Aerospace. “This was the moment we proved that this wasn’t just an academic concept, that this was real, and it has incredible applications in both space, defense and, ultimately, aviation.” Wednesday’s demonstration test was conducted at Spaceport America in New Mexico. Venus’ engine was mounted on a 12-foot rocket built, designed, and integrated in-house. The engine was successful on its first attempt in spite of windy conditions.  A view of Venus Aerospace’s Rotating Detonation Rocket Engine (RDRE) as it launched its test flight.

It also has the potential to be about ten times cheaper, as well as scalable for both defense and commercial uses, according to Duggleby. The technology could revolutionize commercial travel, enabling flights from Los Angeles to Tokyo in under two hours—a trip that currently takes about 11 hours. “Anytime we have had an increase in connectivity in the world, whether we went from trains to automobiles to planes to jet engines, every single increase in that transportation capability has brought about both peace and prosperity,” says Duggleby. “How does the world change if you can fly across the globe and still be home for dinner? What meetings happen if you can hop on the plane and go meet with someone face-to-face?” Venus is also planning to test its RDRE engine together with a ramjet engine. Together, the two could enable aircraft to take off from conventional runways, transition to speeds higher than six times the speed of sound, and maintain hypersonic cruising speeds without the need for rocket boosters. Depending on funding and partnerships, Venus is targeting the 2030s to fly an initial high-speed plane. That timeline still places the company well at the forefront of hypersonic innovation, Duggleby says. On the back of its recent success, Venus is gearing up to raise a series B round of funding. There is tremendous demand for hypersonic travel, with a market projected to surpass $12 billion by 2030 across aerospace, defense, and commercial aviation. The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, May 30, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
