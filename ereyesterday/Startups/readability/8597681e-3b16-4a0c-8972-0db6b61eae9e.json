  "link": "",
  "description": "Amy Errett had a hunch that hair color was a huge potential market – especially among women who wanted an option free from harsh chemicals. She started a company focused on clean ingredients, innovative technology, and a revamped salon experience. Since founding Madison Reed in 2013, more than 5 million people have tried her products.
