Her ideal job was one where she wouldn’t have to think, just follow the script, hit the metrics, go home.I understood and I hired her anyway. Maybe because I recognized my complicity. As an operations-focused entrepreneur and investor, I have spent years optimizing processes, standardizing procedures, measuring everything.And she was the logical endpoint: a human being who aspired to be a machine. This wasn’t laziness; it is a perfectly rational response to impossible workplace conditions.The numbers tell the same story. While Medallia research shows that 61 percent of consumers in hospitality and retail will pay more for personalized experiences, only 25 percent report actually receiving them. Just one-third of customers are satisfied with the state of service.We’ve optimized the humanity out of human service. In our quest for efficiency, we’ve made genuine connection a premium product.1. The uncanny valley of serviceYou know that unsettling feeling when ChatGPT tries too hard to sound human? That same repulsion happens when your staff delivers perfectly scripted, technically correct service that somehow feels wrong.We’ve trained workers to be so standardized that their friendliness triggers the same alarm bells as AI-generated text. Every interaction follows the flowchart. Every smile hits the metric. Every word comes from the script.The cost? In luxury categories, warmth is now worth more than accuracy. The uncanny valley isn’t just creepy it’s a revenue crater.Try this instead: Replace scripts with scenarios. Train staff on what good service looks like, then let them figure out how to deliver it. Give them permission to be inconsistent if it means being genuine. 2. You’ve turned humanity into a luxury productWe pay more for a receptionist who remembers our name than for the room she’s welcoming us into. Personalization was once standard. Now it’s an upgrade. Soon it will be behind a paywallAirlines operate on 3 percent margins in a business where everyone claims price is all that matters. Yet researchers in South Korea found that authenticity, not price or routes, drives loyalty. When the most commoditized industry on earth can compete on being human, you might want to pay attentionTry this instead: Identify three moments in your customer journey where authentic interaction matters most. Lean on being human there. Make these your “judgment zones,” places where efficiency takes a back seat to effectiveness. 3. Your robot workers aren’t broken—they’re obeyingThat woman who wanted to be a robot? She wasn’t damaged. She was responding rationally to systems that punish deviation and treat authentic interaction as inefficiency.When every smile is measured and every deviation punished, becoming robotic is a matter of survival. Your best people don’t leave because the job is hard. They leave because you won’t let them do it well.Last week, I checked in to a hotel in Tokyo with my daughter. The staff gave her a crayon set in the lobby corner Kids’ Club. A few minutes later, another little girl showed up. They were out of crayons.The clerk checked the system, saw the delay, and offered her a juice instead. Probably what the protocol said to do.The girl didn’t want juice. SHE. WANTED. TO. COLOR. And she let the entire lobby hear it. My daughter noticed and offered to share her crayons, asking the clerk for a balloon instead. A balloon probably would have worked for the other kid too but that wasn’t in the manual.A four-year-old saw what the moment needed. The adult followed the manual. That’s not a training failure. That’s what happens when we optimize the judgment out of service.Try this instead: This week, give your customer service reps a $50-200 problem-solving budget. No approval needed. Track what they do with it. You’ll be surprised. Teach them to ask: “What would make this feel right for you?” Then give floor staff 10 minutes to make it happen no questions asked. Then, celebrate the decisions they make, even when they’re different from yours. 4. Robots can’t beat you at being humanBut they’re already better at being robotic.People want connection. They want someone to notice the rainy forecast and offer an umbrella.While you race to the bottom on efficiency, premium competitors win by offering what you’ve eliminated: the unexpected gesture, the remembered preference, the moment of genuine care. They’re not better at operations. They’re in a different business entirely.As AI becomes ubiquitous, authentic human service becomes more valuable, not less. The companies that will thrive aren’t those that turn people into robots, they’re the ones that let robots be robots and humans be human.Try this instead: Replace your service manual with one question: “What would you do if this was your grandmother?” Watch how fast problems get solved. The real cost of efficiencyYou wanted efficiency. Your employees wanted predictability. Your customers got human robots delivering mechanical experiences.The woman I hired stayed for 18 months. We gave her permission to think, to solve problems her way, to be human.The future belongs to businesses that can be strategically human in an increasingly robotic world.Monday morning, pick your most scripted customer interaction. Give three employees permission to handle it their way. Report back on what happens. Even if it’s inefficient.Your customers will notice the difference. And they’ll come back.The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is this Friday, June 27, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
