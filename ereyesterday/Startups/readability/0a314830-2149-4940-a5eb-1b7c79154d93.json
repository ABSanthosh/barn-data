  "text": "The Trump administration is planning even more cuts to the Environmental Protect Agency. This time, the agency’s Energy Star program is reportedly next.Energy Star is a EPA-run program that has promoted energy-efficient practices since the early ‘90s. The Energy Star label signals to consumers that their appliance purchases meet certain standards and specifications for energy efficiency, much like what USDA Organic certification means for food production standards. Furthermore, the program boasts that Energy Star appliances have helped consumers avoid some $500 billion in energy costs, saved 5 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity, and reduced 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions since it started in 1992.“They say for every dollar that’s spent on Energy Star, consumers are saving $350, so it’s a significant impact,” says Paula Glover, president of bipartisan energy efficiency coalition the Alliance to Save Energy. Plus, the Alliance to Save Energy estimates that Energy Star supports close to 750,000 jobs, when considering all the jobs it takes to design, manufacture, and sell efficient appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines. Eliminating the decades-old program, Glover says, would fly in the face of several of President Donald Trump’s goals for domestic energy policy, reaffirmed in early executive orders, which include making energy more affordable and promoting consumer choice.“This particular policy is counterintuitive to the President’s desire to reduce household energy bills,” she says. “I would also suggest that Energy Star actually offers consumers more choice, not less.”The Alliance to Save Energy is a bipartisan, nonprofit coalition that aims to advance energy efficiency policies. It was founded in 1977 following the oil embargo in the 1970s, which exposed weaknesses in American energy policy, or as Glover says, “an over-reliance on foreign sources.” Today’s energy situation represents a different sort of crisis in which the rising power needs of AI and a growing population intersect with the worsening effects of climate change.“The more that we rely on AI, the more electricity that we’re going to be using. We’re also seeing extreme weather in places where we hadn’t seen it before. All of this drives demand,” Glover says. “While we are talking about ways that we are going to produce more energy because we need it, we should also be talking about how we’re going to use less. It’s a two-sided coin.”She adds: “Having that Energy Star label is the way that consumers can be assured that this thing that [they’re] buying is going to do the things that it says that it is going to do.”In the past, the program has faced criticism for lax standards and self reporting. In 2010, a Government Accountability Office report found it was “vulnerable to fraud and abuse,” and recommended certain corrective actions such as using third parties to test products prior to certification. Energy Star began requiring third-party testing in 2011.Reports of possible cuts to the Energy Star program followed a reorganization plan the EPA announced on Friday. The changes, according to an EPA spokesperson, affect the Office of the Administrator, Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP), and Office of Water. During a Friday town hall, E\u0026E News reported that EPA appointees called to eliminate the Office of Atmospheric Protection, of which Energy Star is part. It was subsequently discussed in a Monday meeting of office staffers, and was targeted for elimination in Trump’s partial budget proposal, The Washington Post reported.“With this action, EPA is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency’s core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback,” an EPA spokesperson shared in response to Inc’s questions about Energy Star.The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
