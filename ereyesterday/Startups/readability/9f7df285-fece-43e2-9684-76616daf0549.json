  "text": "Warren Buffett has never been one to chase headlines. For most of his career, the 93-year-old billionaire investor has preferred to let his actions—and his annual shareholder letters—do the talking. But even Warren Buffett can’t give away $6 billion in a single day without people noticing.This week, Buffett made his largest-ever annual donation, giving away 13.7 million Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock to five charitable organizations. It’s part of a long-standing plan he announced in 2006 to gradually give away the vast majority of his fortune. With this latest gift, Buffett’s total philanthropic giving now exceeds $60 billion.It would be easy to get caught up in the big numbers: a $6 billion donation, more than $60 billion given in total, and still tens of billions left to distribute. But, believe it or not, the money isn’t the real story. There is, in fact, a far more important story here, and it’s a lesson for everyone who cares about leaving a legacy.The importance of legacyLook, if you’re a billionaire, at some point it just starts to look impolite to hold on to all that money. That’s why so many wealthy people start foundations. Sure, some of them are genuinely concerned with putting their money to good use. Some of them, on the other hand, are very much concerned with conjuring up the right kind of PR message, and giving away money tends to do that.Buffett’s approach, on the other hand, has always been deliberate and deeply personal. Each year, he converts a portion of his Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares into Class B shares, which are then distributed to several charitable foundations.For now, the biggest beneficiary continues to be the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation, which received approximately $4.6 billion this year. Buffett has said that the Gates Foundation “has no money coming after my death.”Buffett’s future approachInstead, Buffett plans to entrust his children to give away the rest of his fortune. Part of the $6 billion in shares went to The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation—named after his late wife. The remaining shares went to the Sherwood, Howard G. Buffett, and NoVo Foundations, each of which is run by one of Buffett’s three children.When Buffett first announced his giving plan in 2006, he was clear: “I want to give my kids enough so that they can do anything, but not so much that they can do nothing.” Recently, he has come to trust his children as the best people to carry on his legacy—entrusting them to make decisions once he has passed away.I don’t think Buffett’s legacy is just about money or even the good it can do—it’s also about how he’s used his platform. In an era when many business leaders are eager to build personal brands or insert themselves into every cultural debate, Buffett has remained remarkably consistent. He read, invests, and explains things clearly. Not only that but he seems to have an understanding of the responsibility that comes with his measure of wealth. More importantly, he seems to understand what matters most.What matters mostThat’s perhaps the most underrated part of his legacy. Here is a man who has more wealth than almost anyone in history, and yet still lives in the same Omaha house he bought in 1958. He eats McDonald’s for breakfast, drinks Coca-Cola, and plays bridge. He’s famously frugal but incredibly generous, and his giving reflects his values.Buffett is reported to have once said that, “Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.” It’s a metaphor for investing, of course, but it’s also a perfect summary of his philanthropic vision. He’s planting trees he’ll never sit under—but someone else will. That’s the point.Buffett has said that when he dies, 99.5% of his remaining wealth will go to charitable causes, and that those funds must be distributed within ten years. “I want the money spent,” he explained, not preserved in perpetuity. It’s an important distinction. Buffett isn’t trying to build an eternal institution—he’s trying to ensure his money makes a real difference.That focus on impact is unusual in philanthropy. Most large foundations are built to last forever. Buffett is building to finish well. He’s betting that the real measure of success isn’t how long a foundation exists, but how effectively it changes lives while it does.Obviously, not everyone can give away billions of dollars. However, everyone can learn from how Buffett approaches it. His legacy isn’t measured in good public relations or headlines. It’s measured in the careful, intentional way he’s chosen to give and make room for the next generation to lead.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc.
