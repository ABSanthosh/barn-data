  "text": "Join the event trusted by enterprise leaders for nearly two decades. VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy. Learn more Editor’s note: Carl will lead an editorial roundtable on this topic at VB Transform next week. Register today. OpenAI has released a new open-source demo that gives developers a hands-on look at how to build intelligent, workflow-aware AI agents using the Agents SDK. As first noticed by AI influencer and engineer Tibor Blaho (of the third-party ChatGPT browser extension AIPRM), OpenAI’s new Customer Service Agent was published earlier today on the AI code sharing community Hugging Face under a permissive MIT License, meaning any third-party developer or user can take the code, modify it, and deploy it for free for their own commercial or experimental purporses. This agent example demonstrates how to route airline-related requests between specialized agents — like Seat Booking, Flight Status, Cancellation, and FAQ — while enforcing safety and relevance guardrails. The release is designed to help teams go beyond theoretical use and start operationalizing agents with confidence. This practical demonstration arrives just ahead of OpenAI’s upcoming presentation at VentureBeat Transform 2025 next week in San Francisco, June 24-25, where OpenAI’s Head of Platform Olivier Godement will go deeper into the enterprise-grade agent architecture powering use cases at companies like Stripe and Box. Meet Olivier Godement, OpenAI Head of Product, Platform at VB Transform 2025 A blueprint for routing, guardrails, and specialized agents Today’s release includes both a Python backend and a Next.js frontend. The backend leverages the OpenAI Agents SDK to orchestrate interactions between specialized agents, while the frontend visualizes these interactions in a chat interface, showing how decisions and handoffs unfold in real time. In one flow, a customer asks to change a seat. The Triage Agent determines the request and routes it to the Seat Booking Agent, which confirms the booking change interactively. In another scenario, a flight cancellation request is processed through the Cancellation Agent, which validates the customer’s confirmation number before completing the task. Importantly, the demo also shows how guardrails function in production: a Relevance Guardrail blocks out-of-scope queries like asking for poetry, while a Jailbreak Guardrail prevents prompt injection attempts, such as requests to expose system instructions. The architecture mirrors real-world airline support flows, showing how organizations can build domain-focused assistants that are responsive, compliant, and aligned with user expectations. OpenAI released the code under the MIT license and encouraged teams to customize and adapt it for their own needs. From open source to real world enterprise use cases: read OpenAI’s foundations for building practical AI agents This open-source release builds on OpenAI’s broader initiative to help teams design and deploy agent-based systems at scale. Earlier this year, the company published “A Practical Guide to Building Agents,” a 32-page manual for product and engineering teams looking to implement intelligent automation. The guide lays out foundational components—LLM model, external tools, and behavioral instructions—and covers strategies for building both single-agent systems and complex multi-agent architectures. It offers design patterns for orchestration, guardrail implementation, and observability, drawing from OpenAI’s experience supporting large-scale deployments. Key takeaways from the guide include: Model Selection: Use top-tier models to establish performance baselines, then experiment with smaller models for cost-efficiency. Tool Integration: Equip agents with external APIs or functions to retrieve data or perform actions. Instruction Crafting: Use clear, action-oriented prompts and conditionals to guide agent decisions. Guardrails: Layer safety, relevance, and compliance constraints to ensure safe and predictable behavior. Human Intervention: Set up thresholds and escalation paths for cases that require human oversight. The guide emphasizes starting small and evolving agent complexity over time—an approach echoed in the newly released demo, which shows how modular, tool-using sub-agents can be orchestrated cleanly. Learn more from OpenAI at VB Transform 2025 Teams looking to move from prototype to production will get a deeper look at OpenAI’s enterprise-ready approach during Transform 2025, hosted by VentureBeat. Presently scheduled for Wednesday, June 25th at 3:10 PM PT, the session—titled The Year of Agents: How OpenAI is Powering the Next Wave of Intelligent Automation—will feature Olivier Godement, Head of Product for OpenAI’s API platform, in conversation with me, Carl Franzen, Executive Editor at VentureBeat. The 20-minute talk will cover: Agent architecture patterns: when to use single loops, sub-agents, or orchestrated handoffs. Built-in guardrails for regulated environments, including policy refusals, SOC-2 logging, and data residency support. Cost/ROI levers and benchmarks from Stripe and Box, including 35% faster invoice resolution and zero-touch support triage. Roadmap insights: What’s coming next for multimodal actions, agent memory, and cross-cloud orchestration. Whether you’re experimenting with open-source tools like the Customer Service Agent demo or scaling agents into critical workflows, this session promises a grounded look at what’s working, what to avoid, and what’s next. Why it matters for enterprises and developers Between the newly released demo and the principles outlined in A Practical Guide to Building Agents, OpenAI is doubling down on its strategy: enabling developers to move past single-turn LLM applications and toward autonomous systems that can understand context, route tasks intelligently, and operate safely. By offering transparent tooling and clear implementation examples, OpenAI is pushing agentic systems out of the lab and into everyday use—whether in customer service, operations, or internal governance. For organizations exploring intelligent automation, these resources provide not just inspiration, but a working playbook.
