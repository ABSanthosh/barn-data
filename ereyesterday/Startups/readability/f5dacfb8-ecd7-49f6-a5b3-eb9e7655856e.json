If they’d had the slightest idea of what the average 9 to 5 really entailed, offering themselves up as tiger food might have seemed attractive by comparison.  One of my first jobs out of college gave the idea of being devoured alive a run for its money. I won’t bore you with the details; suffice it to say that it involved a lot of brainless but backbreaking labor.  One day, when my boss asked if any of us were qualified to drive a massive load of excavated cement to his private dump, I ecstatically raised my hand. Growing up on a farm meant I’d learned how to handle dangerous machines when most kids were watching Saturday morning cartoons; volunteering meant a nice little break from work shoveling wet concrete. It didn’t exactly work out that way. A dumb decision at the dump led me to tipping the truck on its side, after which I was forced to walk around begging strangers to let me use their telephone. My boss was peeved, to say the least. After we got the truck back on the road, he instructed me to pull into a gas station to fill it up. Happy for a second chance, I promptly sideswiped a car at the next pump, completely crushing one of its doors in the process. I was fired on the spot.  The comparative joys of paperwork I began with this horror story because this article is about the paperwork necessary for starting a small business, and paperwork stinks. You know what stinks worse, though? Not starting a small business and devoting your life to working for someone else instead.   It’ll take a significant amount of paperwork and form-filling to ensure that your business is legally recognized and compliant with all relevant regulations, but it beats a day job. The specific forms and documents required can vary depending on the type of business structure you choose, such as a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company (LLC), or corporation. Here’s a comprehensive overview of the key paperwork and forms new small business owners typically need to complete: Business structure and registration  Business name registration: If your business name is different from your personal name, you’ll need to register it with your state’s secretary of state. This is usually done by filing a “doing business as” (DBA) name, also known as a fictitious business name. For LLCs and corporations, registering the business name is part of the formation process. It can usually be accomplished online.   Articles of incorporation (corporations): These documents are required for corporations and include details such as the company name, purpose, stock information, and the names of incorporators and directors. They must be filed with the state’s secretary of state office.  Articles of organization (LLCs): Similar to articles of incorporation, these documents are necessary for LLCs and provide information about the company name, purpose, management structure, and registered agent.  Partnership agreements: While not legally required, a written partnership agreement is highly recommended for partnerships. It outlines partners’ roles, responsibilities, and profit-sharing arrangements.  Tax and identification forms  Employer identification number (EIN): An EIN, also known as a federal tax ID number, is essential for most businesses. It is used to identify your business for tax purposes and is required if you have employees or if your business is structured as a corporation or partnership.  Tax forms: Depending on your business structure, you’ll need to file different tax forms. For example, sole proprietors use Schedule C (Form 1040), partnerships file Form 1065, and corporations use Form 1120.  State tax ID number: Some states require a separate state tax ID number in addition to the federal EIN.  Licenses and permits  Business licenses: Depending on the type of business and its location, you may need various licenses and permits. These can include professional licenses, zoning permits, or health department permits.  Local business registration: While not always required, some cities or counties may require you to register your business locally.  Employee and contract forms  Employee agreements: If you plan to hire employees, you’ll need employment contracts that outline terms of employment, compensation, and responsibilities.  Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs): These are useful for protecting confidential business information when dealing with employees, contractors, or partners.  Independent contractor agreements: If you hire freelancers or independent contractors, these agreements define the scope of work and payment terms.  Other essential documents  Operating agreement (LLCs and partnerships): While not always required by law, an operating agreement is crucial for outlining ownership, management responsibilities, and decision-making processes within an LLC or partnership.  Bylaws (corporations): These documents govern the internal operations of a corporation, including the roles of officers and shareholders.  Beneficial ownership information (BOI) reporting: Under the Corporate Transparency Act, certain businesses must report beneficial ownership information to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  Trademark registration: If you want to protect your business name or logo, consider registering for a trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  Starting a small business requires careful planning and compliance with various legal and regulatory requirements. Ensuring that all necessary paperwork and forms are completed accurately and on time—consulting with legal financial professionals if necessary—is crucial for establishing a solid foundation for your business. It’ll help you breathe at night, too; the last thing you want is to attract the attention of fine-loving bureaucrats. My schooldays are well behind me, but I do recall that Zeus seemed to relish hurling thunderbolts at non-compliant underlings (along with turning them into animals, chaining them to rocks, forcing them to hold up the sky—that sort of thing). If we entrepreneurs can’t buy our way back into Eden, let’s least avoid all the self-inflicted punishment that we can.  The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
