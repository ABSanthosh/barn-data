  "text": "When Cate Luzio founded Luminary, a women-focused professional networking platform, many people discouraged her from funding it herself. “Everyone told me, ‘Go raise money, don’t take this huge risk and build your business on your own dollars,’” she says on Inc.’s From the Ground Up podcast. Luzio didn’t listen. She decided to bootstrap her business—which she calls “stiletto-strapping” for female founders, “because it’s harder”—for three reasons.  “As a woman who was building a community for women and allies, I wanted to put my money where my mouth was,” she says. “That’s number one. Two, I didn’t want to wait around until I proved my model. I knew my model was going to work. And three, I really wanted to be able to take in feedback from the customer at all times.” This move paid off. According to Luzio, Luminary hasn’t needed “a dollar of additional capital” since her first round of fundraising in 2018.  “The business funds itself—we’re a sustainable and profitable business,” she says. “And so if you have metrics that can get you to that point, not only can you generate return for yourself as the shareholder, you can generate revenue to put back into the business, to hire more, if that’s your goal, to launch more products, to do more businesses.” Plus, if she had an investor telling her what to do, the entrepreneur adds, she wouldn’t have been able to survive the pandemic or acquire three companies. Luzio says she has never forgotten a piece of advice fashion designer and founder Diane von Furstenberg gave her in early 2020: “She said to me, ‘My one piece of advice to you is to keep your business yours for as long as you possibly can. Call the shots and make sure … you’re building the business for the right reasons.’” To hear Luzio’s take on the state of female fundraising in general, use the player below or listen to From the Ground Up on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and other podcast platforms. The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
