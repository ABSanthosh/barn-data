  "text": "The deadline for TikTok to find a buyer is fast approaching: if ByteDance, the Chinese parent company behind the wildly popular video platform, doesn’t spin off its U.S. operations to a non-Chinese owner by Saturday, April 5, the app faces a total ban from the country.Among the potential suitors are some of the most recognizable entrepreneurs in the country, including Elon Musk, Kevin “Mr. Wonderful” O’Leary and YouTube powerhouse MrBeast.If a deal emerges by April 5, it will likely be one of the biggest M\u0026A plays of the year, despite an otherwise unsteady mergers and acquisitions climate. The end result will almost certainly shake up America’s social media landscape, too: TikTok has reshaped internet culture over the last five years, and whoever controls its U.S. operations will have a direct handle on one of the biggest media and marketing channels in the country.The price tag on the app is, of course, subject to negotiation—but estimates put the value of its American business alone in the tens of billions.So who are the top contenders? President Trump told reporters over the weekend that there are “a lot of potential buyers”–and while TikTok itself has been tight-lipped, a few big names seem to be leading the pack.A consortium of non-Chinese ByteDance investors, led by the quantitative trading firm Susquehanna International Group and the investment firm General Atlantic, has been identified by Reuters as one of the front-runners for the deal. One private equity firm, KKR, is reportedly also involved, while another, Blackstone, is said to be considering taking on its own minority stake.Earlier in the year, the White House was in talks with Oracle about assembling a team of outside investors to take control of the app, NPR reported at the time. Microsoft was supposedly involved in the talks, too. Many onlookers still expect that Oracle, which already provides cloud services for the app, will play a substantial operational role in TikTok’s next iteration. The AI search engine startup Perplexity has also said it’s put forward a bid to absorb TikTok.Several well-known individuals have also thrown their name into the ring. Working with Jimmy Donaldson, the YouTuber better known as MrBeast, is Jesse Tinsley, founder of the HR platform Employer.com; There’s also a group calling itself “The People’s Bid for TikTok” which counts Mr. Wonderful as well as Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt among its members; wealth management entrepreneur Reid Rasner; and potentially, per some reports, Musk, the billionaire mogul behind Tesla, SpaceX and, most recently, X.There also seems to be a good chance that ByteDance itself will retain some stake in the TikTok spin-off, albeit a minority one.One dark horse in all this? The U.S. government. Trump at one point suggested that a national sovereign wealth fund could take on the app.Of course, it’s always hard to know what to expect with the president: he’s already said that he might just extend the sale deadline again if a deal doesn’t materialize in time.National security concerns about TikTok’s Chinese owners led to the bipartisan passage of a law in 2024 that required ByteDance to divest its American operations by January of this year, or else get kicked out of the country altogether. The app did briefly go offline in the States, but soon returned after then-president elect Trump said he would extend the window for a sale.Critics have pushed back on the deal on both free speech and free market grounds. Polling puts TikTok’s American user base at approximately one-third of all adults and two-thirds of all teens; TikTok itself has claimed that about half the U.S. population uses the app.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
