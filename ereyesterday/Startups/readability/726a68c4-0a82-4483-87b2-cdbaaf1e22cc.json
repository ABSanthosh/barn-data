  "title": "#809: The 4-Hour Workweek Tools That Still Work — The Art of Refusal and The Low-Information Diet",
  "link": "",
  "description": "This time around, we have a bit of a different format, featuring the book that started it all for me, The 4-Hour Workweek. Readers and listeners often ask me what I would change or update, but an equally interesting question is: what wouldn’t I change? What stands the test of time and hasn’t lost any potency? This episode features two of the most important chapters from the audiobook of The 4-Hour Workweek. The chapters push you to defend your scarce attention—one by saying no to people, the other by saying no to excess information.Sponsors:David Protein Bars 28g of protein, 150 calories, and 0g of sugar: https://davidprotein.com/tim (Buy 4 cartons, get the 5th free.)Our Place's Titanium Always Pan® Pro using nonstick technology that’s coating-free and made without PFAS, otherwise known as “Forever Chemicals”: https://fromourplace.com/tim (Shop their Spring Sale today!)AG1 all-in-one nutritional supplement: https://DrinkAG1.com/Tim (1-year supply of Vitamin D (and 5 free AG1 travel packs) with your first subscription purchase.)Timestamps:[00:00:00] Start.[00:07:24] The low-information diet.[00:09:45] Cultivating selective ignorance.[00:14:32] How to read 200% faster in 10 minutes.[00:17:09] Questions and actions: Go on an immediate one-week media fast.[00:21:05] Develop the habit of asking yourself, “Will I definitely use this information for something immediate and important?”[00:22:03] Practice the art of nonfinishing.[00:22:49] Comfort challenge: Get phone numbers.[00:25:14] Interrupting interruption and the art of refusal.[00:28:16] Not all evils are created equal.[00:29:36] Time wasters: Become an ignoramus.[00:30:09] Limit email consumption and production.[00:33:05] Screen incoming and limit outgoing phone calls.[00:36:10] Master the art of refusal and avoiding meetings.[00:38:33] In order of preference, steer people toward email, phone, and in-person meetings.[00:38:59] Respond to voicemail via email whenever possible.[00:40:50] Meetings should only be held to make decisions about a predefined situation, not to define the problem.[00:41:53] If you absolutely cannot stop a meeting or call from happening, define the end time.[00:43:00] The cubicle is your temple — don’t permit casual visitors.[00:44:24] Use the Puppy Dog Close to help your superiors and others develop the no-meeting habit.[00:46:48] Time consumers: Batch and do not falter.[00:50:05] How much is your time worth?[00:50:45] Estimate the amount of time you will save by grouping similar tasks and batching them.[00:51:14] Determine how much problems cost to fix in each period.[00:53:02] Empowerment failure: Rules and readjustment.[00:59:44] Questions and actions: Create systems to limit your availability.[01:01:55] Batch activities to limit setup cost and provide more time for dreamline milestones.[01:02:25] Set or request autonomous rules and guidelines with occasional review of results.[01:03:18] Tools for eliminating paper distractions, capturing everything.[01:05:28] Tools for screening and avoiding unwanted calls.[01:07:12] Tools for scheduling without back-and-forth.[01:08:23] Tools for choosing the best email batching times.[01:09:13] Tools for emailing without entering the inbox black hole.[01:10:20] Tools for preventing web browsing/internet use.[01:11:10] Comfort challenge: revisit the terrible twos.[01:12:07] Lifestyle design in action.*For show notes and past guests on The Tim Ferriss Show, please visit tim.blog/podcast.For deals from sponsors of The Tim Ferriss Show, please visit tim.blog/podcast-sponsorsSign up for Tim’s email newsletter (5-Bullet Friday) at tim.blog/friday.For transcripts of episodes, go to tim.blog/transcripts.Discover Tim’s books: tim.blog/books.Follow Tim:Twitter: twitter.com/tferriss Instagram: instagram.com/timferrissYouTube: youtube.com/timferrissFacebook: facebook.com/timferriss LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/timferrissPast guests on The Tim Ferriss Show include Jerry Seinfeld, Hugh Jackman, Dr. Jane Goodall, LeBron James, Kevin Hart, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Jamie Foxx, Matthew McConaughey, Esther Perel, Elizabeth Gilbert, Terry Crews, Sia, Yuval Noah Harari, Malcolm Gladwell, Madeleine Albright, Cheryl Strayed, Jim Collins, Mary Karr, Maria Popova, Sam Harris, Michael Phelps, Bob Iger, Edward Norton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Neil Strauss, Ken Burns, Maria Sharapova, Marc Andreessen, Neil Gaiman, Neil de Grasse Tyson, Jocko Willink, Daniel Ek, Kelly Slater, Dr. Peter Attia, Seth Godin, Howard Marks, Dr. Brené Brown, Eric Schmidt, Michael Lewis, Joe Gebbia, Michael Pollan, Dr. Jordan Peterson, Vince Vaughn, Brian Koppelman, Ramit Sethi, Dax Shepard, Tony Robbins, Jim Dethmer, Dan Harris, Ray Dalio, Naval Ravikant, Vitalik Buterin, Elizabeth Lesser, Amanda Palmer, Katie Haun, Sir Richard Branson, Chuck Palahniuk, Arianna Huffington, Reid Hoffman, Bill Burr, Whitney Cummings, Rick Rubin, Dr. Vivek Murthy, Darren Aronofsky, Margaret Atwood, Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel, Dr. Gabor Maté, Anne Lamott, Sarah Silverman, Dr. Andrew Huberman, and many more.See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
