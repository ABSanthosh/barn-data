As CEO of Investopedia and later Meetup, for nearly a decade I was in constant motion—managing crises, solving problems, rallying teams, meeting investors, making calls that affect people’s lives and livelihoods. It was intense, all-consuming, and deeply rewarding. Then, one day, it was over. I sold the company. The meetings disappeared. The urgency vanished. The inbox went quiet. After years of operating at full tilt, I had nothing but time. Friends told me I’d lose my mind. That I should jump into another CEO role to maximize my earnings. At only 49, I was too young to walk away. While I had a significant exit, I would need to reduce some expenses if I fully stopped working. I didn’t take another job, and I’m glad I didn’t. A year later, I’ve been surprised by how different and meaningful this next chapter has become. It hasn’t always been easy. I’ve had moments of excitement and moments of doubt. I’ve explored, tested, failed, and adjusted, but I haven’t looked back. As a 19-year-old college student, I vividly remember reading The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck. That book shaped how I think about choice, about doing the harder thing, the less obvious thing. Take your road, not the one others expect. What follows are 10 principles that helped me navigate life after full-time work and build something fulfilling without a title, a company, or a corner office in a phase I’ve come to call “Life After the Title.” 1. Be prepared Don’t wait until you stop your full-time role to figure out what’s next. The groundwork starts years before your last day. In my late 30s, I already had a vision for life after full-time work. I told my wife that I wanted to be a professor when I retired. Her response, “What are you waiting for?” Now I’ve been teaching for 10 years, first at Pace University then Columbia University. By taking on a side-gig, I was able to maintain that meaningful role in my next life stage. I had always imagined I would enjoy mentoring and coaching CEOs but had no professional experience doing so. An opportunity to lay the groundwork for that came unexpectedly from Jewel, the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter. When I was the CEO of Meetup, I had Jewel as a guest on my Keep Connected podcast. She asked if, as part of a fundraising effort for her charity, I could donate some coaching and mentoring. That experience led to my first client. It is important to expect your new work life will take multiple years and not just a few months. You’ll want to actively test, build, learn, and pivot in the years prior. Get a head start. Be prepared to understand what savings you need at a conservative investment return rate (I use 5 percent). This allows you to prepare financially as well. 2. Begin with yes, and learn to say no There is a time to say yes and a time to say no. Mistakes abound in both directions. A tech CEO friend of mine decided to take Jim Carrey’s approach in the 2008 movie Yes Man and agreed to every meeting requested. Hundreds. While he enjoyed meeting a ton of new people and ultimately found his calling through one such randomly accepted meeting, unless you are an extreme extrovert and have unlimited time, saying yes to everything will both exhaust you and be incredibly inefficient. Another friend knew exactly what she wanted to do and was focused on working for a nonprofit aligned with her mission—only to learn she hated the work. How do you find balance? You don’t. In life after full-time work, you start with an opportunistic mindset and a willingness to solicit and accept conversations that may be useless.  You then need to learn from those conversations, start pivoting, and focus on the areas that your gut is telling you. Go from yes as your default to no. You’ll be surprised how comfortable people are to receive a polite and respectful message that you can’t meet, as you “are trying to stay highly focused on having fewer conversations.”  3. Find your ikigai Ikigai is a Japanese term that is a conjunction of iki (to live) and gai (reason) — the reason to live. It represents the intersection of four of life’s priorities: what you love (passion), what you are good at (skills), what the world needs (impact), and what you can be paid for (profession). Because your work is likely less focused on optimizing your salary, it is critical that you consider each of the other three. Finding the intersection of your passion, skills, and impact must be a top priority. Israel was always an important part of my life but after the brutal invasion of Hamas on October 7, 2023, I decided that my personal impact would be to focus on my ikigai and leverage my leadership skills to help Israel—a country and people whom I have always loved. The simple ikigai framework made it easy to decide to build a nonprofit called the Israel Tech Mission. It has driven millions in venture capital to Israel by getting tech leaders to visit and invest in the country. Leveraging your deep skills is one of the most effective ways to find your ikigai and to maximize both your impact and personal satisfaction. 4. Test and fail: You are your MVP When launching a business, entrepreneurs are told to build their MVP—the minimal viable product required to gain feedback, learn, and pivot. But now the focus is on you. Think of yourself as an MVP. Try several different experiences to see how they feel. A founder I know had always dreamed of sailing around the world. His MVP was to do a two-week test in the Mediterranean. He was sick, lonely, and learned that his dream needed to change. His failed dream was an incredible learning from which he pivoted. Figure out how to test what you most want to do. In my life after full-time work, I tested investing. Hated it. Board seats. Nope. Advising and coaching CEOs. Loved it. 5. Delegate like a CEO As a CEO, I understood the importance of delegation. It was essential to focus on what mattered most—and that principle doesn’t stop being true just because you no longer have a team reporting to you. I am a little embarrassed to share this, but in 22 years in the suburbs, I have never cut my lawn. I’ve done zero planting or gardening. I’ve always delegated it to a gardener. Many people are comfortable delegating their lawn to others. However, they feel uncomfortable delegating personal or professional tasks to an assistant when they are no longer working full-time. That’s a mistake. When I left my CEO role, I hired my previous assistant on an hourly basis and that saved up to 10 hours of unenjoyable scheduling and admin tasks. I’ve just hired my first personal assistant to help with other bureaucratic tasks. Your time is valuable both personally and financially. Working with an assistant (and virtual assistants can cost under $10,000 a year) should save more money than it costs. And it will certainly save you many headaches. 6. Serve, not burn If you focus on your passions, skills, and interests, it is likely that you will choose to at least partially serve and mentor others. I’ve always both believed and experienced that the mentor often gains more than the mentee. This is a perfect opportunity to ramp up your servant leadership. Sitting on nonprofit boards, mentoring, teaching, coaching, and advising present incredible opportunities for your own growth. If the New York Times best-selling book From Strength to Strength by Arthur Brooks is to be believed, then while our analytical skills, muscle mass, libido, and virtually all else declines as we age, our ability to connect with and teach others improves meaningfully in the second half of life. It has always amazed me that often the most selfish action—focusing on what is great for yourself—is to be as unselfish and give as much as possible. But you can overdo it, and I did. Upon retiring I decided that helping others is good and the more you help the better. Boy was I wrong. For a couple of months my days were filled with Zoom meetings with anyone who wanted help (whether I knew them or not). It felt very transactional, and it took its toll. Now, I’m more intentional. I respond to everyone, but I say no about half the time.  7. Manage the ego Letting go of full-time work isn’t just about adjusting your calendar—it’s about adjusting your identity. If you’ve spent years as a CEO, founder, or leader, it’s easy to get used to being needed, listened to, and respected. And it’s even easier to let that status quietly define your sense of self. For 10 years I was the CEO of a well-known tech company. First Investopedia and then Meetup. I was wined and dined, flew business class, stayed at top hotels and had a line of people interested—or at least pretending to be—in my company and opinion. And then I stopped being CEO. I became a “former” as my greatest description. One can argue that any time you need to describe yourself with the word “former” as your top achievement, it’s time to do something different. The invitations stopped quickly. I remember the first time I wanted to be invited to a VIP conference and was rejected. I was fortunate to get direct feedback from the organizer: “You don’t run a company anymore and we needed to give that spot to someone else.” It hurt, but it also made complete sense. However, here’s what I learned: If your self-worth depends on your title, then you haven’t really earned it. Managing your ego is something that should start long before you leave. If you haven’t done that work during your career, the transition out of it will hit a lot harder. It took me over a year to stop calling myself a former CEO. I’m embarrassed by how difficult that shift was, but I’m proud I made it. Stepping out of the spotlight doesn’t have to mean stepping away from purpose. It just means your validation has to come from within now. 8. Schedule everything Happiness research has proven that individuals who schedule their happiness are—and get ready for a shocking conclusion—happier. While spontaneity is important and we shouldn’t become slaves to our calendars, it is important to be as maniacal about scheduling your fun and meaningful activities as it used to be in scheduling your one-on-ones with your direct reports. Because you will have more time on your hands, it will be easy to fill that time with less meaningful activities, like watching Netflix at 2 p.m. on a weekday. I take the same approach to my calendar today as I did when I was a CEO. At the beginning of the week, I review my schedule for that week and the following week with my assistant and ensure that it is optimized for the right balance of activities. I have a placeholder every day for “Gym/Fun.”  9. In-person matters When I first retired as a CEO, I took hundreds of 30-minute Zoom meetings. I burned out. Fast. Having 10-12 consecutive meetings may be efficient, but it isn’t effective at furthering your meaningful relationships. I’ve made it a point to ensure that for at least three weekdays, and ideally more, I have in-person connection. In-person, as we say at Meetup, is where the magic happens. I have colleagues who still go into their offices four or five days a week due to their strong need for in-person connecting—or is it to make sure their spouses don’t kill them? Either way, be sure to meet in person. My favorite in-person meetings are walks. I have had hundreds since retiring. Think broadly about whether meeting over coffee or other forms of in-person will drive your goals. Also, try to have as many of your conversations one-on-one. Nothing against group meetings, but if you want real connection, one-on-one is where it happens. 10. Positive loop When you’re no longer working full time, you have more freedom, but also less built-in structure, feedback, and external motivation. That’s why it’s crucial to create a positive loop—a cycle where your effort leads to impact and that impact gives you the energy to keep going. In your life without a title, you have many choices. Perhaps too many. It will be easy to jettison an opportunity when you aren’t seeing momentum. Having positive feedback and seeing results is important because you have less responsibility and more choice. When I founded the Israel Tech Mission, I didn’t plan to create an organization. I planned to take a small group of tech executives to Israel—though it ended up being the largest mission to Israel since the start of the war. My goals changed largely because of the impact and positive feedback from participants, who urged me to plan others. With dozens of articles about our work and hundreds of posts by attendees, the positive loop became incredibly motivating. Whatever you choose to pursue after full-time work, make sure you can see the direct results of your efforts. Seek opportunities where you interact with the people who benefit. That loop will keep the momentum going. Life without a title The deeper truth that runs through the above principles is that the work of becoming yourself never really ends. One of the gifts of stepping away from a title or a role is the freedom to return to who you were before the expectations, before the noise, and to choose again.

I was fortunate to get direct feedback from the organizer: “You don’t run a company anymore and we needed to give that spot to someone else.” It hurt, but it also made complete sense. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"content-chunk\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, here’s what I learned: If your self-worth depends on your title, then you haven’t really earned it. Managing your ego is something that should start long before you leave. If you haven’t done that work during your career, the transition out of it will hit a lot harder. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt took me over a year to stop calling myself a former CEO. I’m embarrassed by how difficult that shift was, but I’m proud I made it. Stepping out of the spotlight doesn’t have to mean stepping away from purpose. It just means your validation has to come from within now. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"h-8-schedule-everything-nbsp\"\u003e8. Schedule everything \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHappiness research has proven that individuals who schedule their happiness are—and get ready for a shocking conclusion—happier. While spontaneity is important and we shouldn’t become slaves to our calendars, it is important to be as maniacal about scheduling your fun and meaningful activities as it used to be in scheduling your one-on-ones with your direct reports. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"content-chunk\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause you will have more time on your hands, it will be easy to fill that time with less meaningful activities, like watching Netflix at 2 p.m. on a weekday. I take the same approach to my calendar today as I did when I was a CEO. At the beginning of the week, I review my schedule for that week and the following week with my assistant and ensure that it is optimized for the right balance of activities. I have a placeholder every day for “Gym/Fun.”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"h-9-in-person-matters-nbsp\"\u003e9. In-person matters \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I first retired as a CEO, I took hundreds of 30-minute Zoom meetings. I burned out. Fast. Having 10-12 consecutive meetings may be efficient, but it isn’t effective at furthering your meaningful relationships. I’ve made it a point to ensure that for at least three weekdays, and ideally more, I have in-person connection. In-person, as we say at Meetup, is where the magic happens. I have colleagues who still go into their offices four or five days a week due to their strong need for in-person connecting—or is it to make sure their spouses don’t kill them? Either way, be sure to meet in person. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy favorite in-person meetings are walks. I have had hundreds since retiring. Think broadly about whether meeting over coffee or other forms of in-person will drive your goals. Also, try to have as many of your conversations one-on-one. Nothing against group meetings, but if you want real connection, one-on-one is where it happens. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"content-chunk\"\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"h-10-positive-loop-nbsp\"\u003e10. Positive loop \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you’re no longer working full time, you have more freedom, but also less built-in structure, feedback, and external motivation. That’s why it’s crucial to create a positive loop—a cycle where your effort leads to impact and that impact gives you the energy to keep going. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn your life without a title, you have many choices. Perhaps too many. It will be easy to jettison an opportunity when you aren’t seeing momentum. Having positive feedback and seeing results is important because you have less responsibility and more choice. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I founded the Israel Tech Mission, I didn’t plan to create an organization. I planned to take a small group of tech executives to Israel—though it ended up being the largest mission to Israel since the start of the war. My goals changed largely because of the impact and positive feedback from participants, who urged me to plan others. With dozens of articles about our work and hundreds of posts by attendees, the positive loop became incredibly motivating. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"content-chunk\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhatever you choose to pursue after full-time work, make sure you can see the direct results of your efforts. Seek opportunities where you interact with the people who benefit. That loop will keep the momentum going. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"h-life-without-a-title-nbsp\"\u003eLife without a title \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe deeper truth that runs through the above principles is that the work of becoming yourself never really ends. One of the gifts of stepping away from a title or a role is the freedom to return to who you were before the expectations, before the noise, and to choose again. This time, on your terms. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe early-rate deadline for the 2025 \u003ca href=\"https://incpowerpartners.secure-platform.com/a\"\u003eInc.
