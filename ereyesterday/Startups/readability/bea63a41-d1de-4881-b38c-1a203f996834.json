  "text": "There’s no shortage of personality types in the workplace, and over my own career, I have encountered many different performers, colleagues, and leaders. At work, there are always problems to be solved, but in my time working on people and culture issues at various tech companies, I particularly noticed the presence of two distinct workplace types—the troubleshooters and the trouble spotters. There’s a broad spectrum between these two extremes, of course, and folks can run the gamut, depending on the situation and their skills. Someone might be great at identifying issues (and solutions) in their field, but really struggle when confronted with unfamiliar issues. Others might be good at spotting problems but need more hands-on coaching to become better at productively solving them.  What do I mean by troubleshooters? Troubleshooters will see the problem, practically try to get ahead of it, articulate it, and bring the right people to find solutions. They will create alternative plans A, B, and C to try to figure out a way to troubleshoot towards a meaningful resolution. Then there are the trouble starters. They will identify a problem, which can actually be valuable. But then they ruminate on the problem, dwell on the problem, complain about the problem, bellyache about the problem, and offer no solutions. Trouble starters can raise an issue, create a swirl, and then sit back and contribute little or nothing as chaos and dissension occur. Their goal is stirring stuff up, and they seem to find satisfaction in the chaos itself rather than in resolution. It’s like they get energized by the disruption rather than by progress. So, how do you turn someone from a trouble starter into a troubleshooter?Troubleshooter or Trouble Spotter? First, it’s important to acknowledge that this is a mindset that can be changed–maybe they’re doing it to avoid accountability, to get noticed without taking on real responsibility, to avoid criticism if their ideas don’t work, or to seem smart without taking any real risks.  Sometimes, it’s not just the person but the organizational culture that enables this behavior. Some places actually reward finding faults but not solving them. Departments that don’t collaborate or performance metrics that reward identifying problems but not fixing them can make starting trouble seem like a smart move, further ingraining the behavior.  As a leader, take a wholesale look at whether your company’s structures, reporting lines, meeting formats, and reward systems are pushing people to focus on problems instead of solving them. Identifying what’s blocking that person and encouraging them to take the crucial step of offering solutions to the problems they’ve found. As they say, the first step is admitting you have a problem—that will help them develop greater self-awareness and let them start unlearing their hesitancy. Then, they can start to find troubleshooting energizing. The best teams (and leaders) use people they identify as troubleshooters to their advantage, recognizing when someone’s knack for finding problems is useful for spotting risks, and helping them grow into solution-oriented thinkers. This approach lets leaders help each of their employees develop using their greatest strengths, rather than using a one-size-fits-all mold that would make for a more homogenous approach and ultimately hold a team back from its fullest potential. Set the tone As an organizational leader, you can set the tone as to team values and norms. Demonstrating what the departmental approaches to problem-solving are or can be sends a helpful message. By letting teammates know that if you are concerned about a problem, you are also encouraging them to offer possible solutions, you’re enabling personal growth within your team and making it more cohesive.  Not everything someone suggests will be the solution, but at least the leader and the team can see how their teammate is thinking. Perhaps that idea can bridge to another solution. There are many roads that lead to Rome, and teams need different alternatives to think about how they might get there. That’s how you can shift to a solutions-oriented mindset and help them see more value in solving the problem than just identifying it. Troubleshooters vs. trouble finders  What separates effective professionals from the rest is their ability to move beyond identification into implementation. The most valuable team members aren’t those who merely spot issues—they’re the ones who roll up their sleeves and develop pathways forward. This requires intellectual curiosity coupled with pragmatism— not just asking, “What’s wrong?” but “How might we make this right?” Organizations that foster a troubleshooting culture tend to be more resilient and innovative. When facing obstacles, these teams don’t waste energy and lose momentum by focusing on blame or despair, but they instead channel it into creative problem-solving. They understand that every challenge presents an opportunity to strengthen processes, relationships, and outcomes for the better. To cultivate and create more troubleshooters in their companies, leaders need to model and mirror this behavior themselves and create a space where proposing solutions—even imperfect ones—is rewarded. Encourage team members to suggest at least one potential solution for each problem they identify. Over time, this practice becomes habit, transforming chronic complainers into valuable contributors.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
