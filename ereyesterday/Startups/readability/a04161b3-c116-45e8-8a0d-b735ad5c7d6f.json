  "text": "China and the U.S. are engaged in a battle over supremacy in the field of artificial intelligence. It’s a story that will be playing out for the foreseeable future, as the Biden administration issued export controls on AI chips to foreign markets, only to see that decision reversed by Donald Trump last month. And Jake Sullivan, former U.S. national security advisor under the Biden administration, warns that could be a big problem.  “I think the current administration’s attitude is ‘just let her rip.'” he told the TechStuff podcast this week. “That concerns me, and I think it puts more impetus, frankly, on the private sector to begin thinking through how it deals with the guardrails question. It cannot just punt the question to the White House since the White House has kind of said, ‘We’re not gonna deal with that.'” Sullivan expressed several concerns about the current administration’s approach to AI. He was unsure if talks would continue about AI risks, for example. And Trump’s decision to rescind limits on the number of chips that can be exported to China without federal approval worries him. (Not directly mentioned, but also likely among his concerns, was a stipulation in Trump’s budget bill that prohibits states from enforcing any laws regulating AI for 10 years.) Unfortunately, he added, leadership in that area can’t wait—and the responsibility may ultimately fall on the shoulders of CEOs of private businesses. “I think that if this administration isn’t gonna step up to take leadership in this, it’s gonna require others, many outside of government, to take leadership in this because it is a project that we cannot dally on,” Sullivan said. His comments were part of a wide-ranging discussion, which covered, among other things, the AI race with China and the rapid pace of AI advancement in general. While OpenAI, Perplexity, and other big domestic companies have long seemed to have the edge, China showed it was not to be overlooked in January with the introduction of DeepSeek, which claimed to outperform AI rivals at a fraction of the cost. Sullivan noted America still has the technological upper hand when it comes to AI, if only because of Nvidia. China, he said, cannot produce in a year anything remotely resembling what that tech giant can. China, however, is motivated to improve its production, in part because of the limits it faces. And the revelation of DeepSeek was a flex to show it planned to remain competitive. “DeepSeek showed me the power of a concerted PR campaign by China, to effectively say, ‘Resistance is futile. These export controls have failed. Give up, America,'” said Sullivan. “I would just point out that the [biggest] issue they raised with me in every meeting … [was] ‘Why did you impose these semiconductor export controls on us?'” While the two countries are far from allies and are racing separately for AI leadership, Sullivan said another area regularly discussed was the risks AI brings to humanity in general. Biden and Chinese president Xi Jinping agreed to launch a dialogue about the AI threat when they met at a summit in 2023. The first session was held the following year, and while it was guarded, given the tensions between the two countries, Sullivan said it “did begin to expose a common understanding of some of the big risks, including the risk at the convergence of biology or biotech and artificial intelligence.” The concerns about AI safety went much deeper than just talking with China when Sullivan was national security advisor, however. The U.S. was preparing for potential artificial general intelligence (AGI, or AI that surpasses human intelligence) loss-of-control scenarios during the Biden administration. Those preparations, however, never resulted in a firm plan of action, he says. “I would say we were in early stages in that, and that was really going to be the work of either a second Biden term or a Harris term,” he said. “We were kind of teeing up and now there’s very good work being done on the outside on some of these questions, including loss-of-control scenarios.” When AGI will happen is one of those things that even the experts can’t agree on, but they all say it’s inevitable. Elon Musk has forecast AI will reach the point of AGI by the end of this year or next. Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis says it could be another 10 years. Whatever the timeline, Sullivan said, protective measures need to be in place long before the technological advance happens—and they need to be agreed upon and followed by all of the companies chasing that goal. “I think we need to race as fast as we can, but we also do need guardrails to ensure safety and alignment,” he said. “At the same time, we have to pay attention to the fact that if we are pursuing a bunch of guardrails, maybe alongside other like-minded states, and China’s choosing the ‘no’ approach, you know, that could give them an advantage in the competition as we go forward.” The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
