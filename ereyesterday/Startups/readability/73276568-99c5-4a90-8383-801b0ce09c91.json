Spotted: As countries around the world struggle to reduce their emissions at the speed needed to avoid catastrophic global warming, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies will likely need to step in to compensate. This is especially the case for high-polluting industries like building and construction, which is responsible for around 40 per cent of the world’s carbon emissions and needs to make serious changes to meet net-zero targets. Startup ecoLocked may have a solution. The Berlin-based company produces carbon-capturing biochar additives and admixes for concrete that can help construction teams slash the carbon footprint of their building materials without compromising on performance. According to the company, the volume of concrete used around the world already has the potential to store four gigatonnes of CO2 every year – and as concrete demand is expected to double by 2060, the carbon-capturing potential of our built environment will grow too. Instead of allowing organic matter to decompose and release CO2, it gets burnt in a low-oxygen environment to produce biochar, effectively locking the CO2 inside. By incorporating biochar into concrete mixes, ecoLocked can turn large concrete buildings, pavements, and stairs into powerful carbon sinks, where CO2 is safely sequestered for millennia. The company can use a variety of biochars in its solutions, and according to Marketing Manager Sepanta Golchin, this allows it to “leverage the inherent differences of biochars to our advantage and deliver targeted product functions such as improved thermal insulation, durability and weight reduction The startup’s first product is called eLM Zero, which is a bio-based admix that allows concrete producers to “inset” the carbon emissions generated by other components (like cement) of the concrete. It can be used to replace up to 10 per cent of a mixture’s cement, along with 10-30 per cent of the aggregates, to create a 100 per cent carbon-neutral concrete. Plus, eLM Zero can be integrated with concrete manufacturers’ existing processes without the need for costly retrofits. Beyond focusing on supplying eLM Zero to customers, ecoLocked also plans to broaden its product catalogue and expand internationally, with a focus on emerging markets where waste biomass is abundant and there’s a growing demand for green construction. Golchin shared with Springwise that the goal is to “enable a cumulative total CO2 impact of one gigatonne until 2035.” Written By: Matilda Cox 8th November 2024 Email: simon@ecolocked.com Website: ecolocked.com Contact: ecolocked.com/contact",
