Amazon’s October Big Deal Days kicked off the holiday season for many brands, and it was the biggest Prime event for the Seattle-based retailer yet, according to its post-event report. Consumers saved more than $1 billion across purchases made during the 48-hour sales event.While savings were high, business performance was actually lower than expected, according to Salesforce director of consumer insights Caila Schwartz. She says that could have been the result of consumer uncertainty resulting from weather events—such as hurricanes Helene and Milton—and the upcoming U.S. election. Salesforce Commerce Cloud tracked the activity of 1.5 billion shoppers over Prime Big Deal Days and found that U.S. sales trended 5 percent lower than they did in 2023, while web traffic decline 2 percent. However, business that leveraged steep discounts during the event saw sales increase 3 percent. “While discount rates were more enticing than last year, retailers still stayed conservative in preparation for robust Cyber Week deals, contributing to the fall in overall results,” Schwartz says.Businesses shouldn’t be discouraged, but remain wary as they head into the holiday shopping season. A recent Salesforce report shared that 47 percent of shoppers plan to buy the same amount as last year, while 40 percent intend to spend less. The majority (two-thirds) are also holding out for Cyber Week deals, which is the week after Thanksgiving.Here’s how Amazon sellers are planning to capture shoppers in this critical time.Keep January in mindOne thing to note for holiday planning? The season doesn’t end with December. That’s exactly why Daily Harvest is approaching the holidays with tempered expectations. Vice president of strategy Neeti Singhal Mahajan says the brand is closely monitoring its holiday approach on all channels, but especially this year as its second selling on Amazon. “As we head into the holiday season, we’re also mindful that January tends to be a really big moment for our brand,” she says, adding that the healthy New Year’s resolutions often draw in Daily Harvest customers. Sales primarily come from the brand’s subscription model, which can be a challenge to market as a holiday gift. That’s why November and December are equally spent building momentum for January sales, as they are for standard gift-giving marketing, she says.Last year felt more experimental as Daily Harvest’s first year selling on Amazon, Mahajan says. The brand learned that its customers don’t respond as much to steep discounts because Daily Harvest is a premium product and customers often buy bundles. With that in mind, the brand decided to be more methodical this year, which is why it will offer a baseline 20 percent off on all its Amazon products and larger discounts on its direct website.“We know that some consumers are just always going to prefer to shop us on Amazon—that’s just a preferred channel for a lot of people,” she says. “So we want to make sure that they can actually benefit from holiday offers just as much as our subscription customers can.”Stand firm on priceAt-home cocktail machine Bartesian doesn’t expect 2024 holidays to be much greater than last year, but still anticipates aggressive sales on the late end of the season. “Christmas was huge for us on Amazon, especially in December,” says founder Ryan Close. In the five years since the brand has operated on Amazon, its direct website has won more in November, meanwhile customers purchased Bartesian products last-minute on Amazon because of same-day or next-day shipping. Making sure Bartesian products are stocked at Amazon distribution centers is an integral part to making it through the holidays, so that customers can get their orders in those short windows of time and Bartesian can make the last-minute sale. “That’s been a big part of our strategy for last few years,” he says.In addition to stocking the fulfillment centers, Close says pricing strategy also takes some prep. In order to participate in Black Friday promotions, the price of a product needs to be constant for roughly 90 days before the event, Close explains. During Cyber Week, an item typically has to be at least 20 percent less than its normal price for Amazon to consider it a “Prime deal.”While keeping prices constant seems simple in theory, Close explains that he and other brands are often competing for the top spot in the “Buy Box,” which is the list of available sellers to buy a product from under the “Buy Now” option. During normal operations, managing the Buy Box can feel like a game of whack-a-mole, he says. Resellers will buy a handful of company products from other retailers like Costco or Sam’s Club, often when store discounts are offered (different from brand discounts), then list them on Amazon for a cheaper price. Amazon automatically lists the seller with the cheapest price at the top of the Buy Box, which means companies lose sales to resellers when the standard price is a few cents higher than a reseller’s.Keeping prices firm for 90 days is important if a brand wants to participate in an Amazon discount event, so sometimes that means letting the resellers win the Buy Box until they sell out. Brands shouldn’t get too caught up in the Buy Box, though. Staying competitive with sales from their direct websites should be the main focus for brands, which is why Bartesian will offer similar discounts on its official site the week before Black Friday.",
