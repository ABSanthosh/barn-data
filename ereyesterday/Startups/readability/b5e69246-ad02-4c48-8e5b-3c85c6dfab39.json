  "text": "There’s a common misconception in business: If you build something great, people will show up.Or, even worse, if you announce it loudly enough, they’ll automatically care.We launched our new corporate wellness solution for small to mid-sized businesses on June 17. It was the product of months of development, team alignment, and marketing prep. And while the launch wasn’t a failure, it was a needed reality check.Because here’s the truth: Most people have their own priorities. Your launch day isn’t one of them.People won’t care unless you give them a reasonWe knew our corporate wellness solution was solving a real problem. But a strong product doesn’t guarantee strong attention. So we worked ahead of the curve.I started by reaching out to relevant contacts I’d built relationships with over the years—reporters, editors, influencers, and contributors in the New Jersey market and digital health. Not a mass blast. These were direct, personalized conversations that positioned our launch as an innovation story with wider implications.It paid off. We landed two local media pickups, both because of relationships I’d cultivated long before we had anything to pitch.Internally, we built a launch kit to make sharing easy: Prewritten LinkedIn captions 1–2 sentence blurbs for social or email A simple explainer doc outlining what we were launching and why it mattered No pressure to share, just an invitation. Still, about 50 percent of the team amplified the message, and that ripple extended our reach far beyond what our own brand account could have done alone.But the biggest learning? Even with great assets and good intentions, not everyone shows up to promote. Some need reminders. Others need relevance. And some just…won’t.That’s why pre-launch work isn’t just about content. It’s about clarity. The more you connect the dots between “what we’re launching” and “why it matters to you,” the more likely people are to carry it forward.Some people show up, some people don’tLet’s talk about the part no one likes to admit: the letdown.We had teammates I was certain would champion the launch. Colleagues who’d been in the room for the strategy, who understood the vision, who had publicly aligned with the mission. I expected them to show up because I thought they wanted to.And then…silence.No share. No repost. Not even a Teams’ reaction.It stings. Not because I take it personally (okay, maybe a little), but because it’s a hard lesson in assumption. Just because someone supports you in principle doesn’t mean they’ll advocate for you in practice. Especially when it costs them attention, effort, or credibility.Sometimes people are overwhelmed. Sometimes they’re unsure of what to say. And sometimes, frustrating as it is, they’re just not thinking about your thing. They’re thinking about theirs.That’s why future launches will include clearer asks, earlier alignment, and more 1:1 clarity around who’s on point for what.A launch is not a moment—it’s a campaignIf you’re planning a launch, here’s my advice: Stop obsessing over the date.Think in weeks. Think in quarters. Think in years.Launch day is just the kickoff, not the win. What actually drives results is what happens after the initial announcement. In our case, most of our traction came not from the launch post itself, but from everything that followed: Follow-up messages to people who hadn’t engaged yet 1:1 outreach to partners, leads, and warm media contacts Iterating our story once we saw what resonated A second and third push of internal messaging, refreshed with new stats and social proof And next time, we’ll be even more structured: Pre-launch education for our team weeks in advance A social calendar with staggered content drops A timeline of check-ins, mini-announcements, and follow-up asks Metrics tied not just to day one views, but to 30-, 60-, and 90-day goals Attention decays quickly. You can either let your story fade…or you can plan for the second time someone hears about it. And the third. And the fifth.The real takeawayJust because you care deeply about your launch doesn’t mean others will.You need to build bridges in advance, create reasons to engage, and stretch your effort long beyond the initial announcement.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, July 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
