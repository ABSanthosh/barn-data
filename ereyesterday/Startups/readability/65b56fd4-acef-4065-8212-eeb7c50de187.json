  "text": "Every Friday at noon half our 380-person company logs on to hear from their colleagues and me. Attendance is not required. There’s no presentation deck and no formal agenda. It’s just 30 minutes to hear what’s going on across the company and beyond.We don’t track attendance. We don’t require cameras. We don’t make participation competitive. I simply show up and trust that when people feel invested in the company, they’ll show up too.This meeting isn’t a formality. It’s a foundation. And in a time when volatility is the norm—economically, socially, and organizationally—it has become one of the most powerful tools I have as a leader. And it didn’t come from a strategic initiative or a consultant’s playbook. It came from a need for clarity, consistency, and connection. More importantly, it has become a way to reinforce our core belief: In an employee-owned company, everyone has the ability and the responsibility to lead.Born out of urgencyLong before our weekly CEO call began, communication was already a cornerstone of our company culture. As an employee-owned architecture and engineering firm with an ESOP structure, we’d held quarterly all-employee meetings for years. But the idea of meeting weekly with a consistent, direct line of communication from the top didn’t take shape until the early days of the pandemic.In March 2020, as much of the company shifted to remote work and faced a cascade of unknowns, our senior leaders knew our people needed more than just policy updates. They needed something steady. So we began holding a weekly Friday meeting at noon. I shared what we knew about the evolving public health crisis, what we were watching, and what decisions we were making and why.That meeting started as a way to provide stability during chaos. But what it revealed was something more enduring: People didn’t just want updates. They wanted honesty. They wanted visibility. And they wanted to feel connected to leadership, to one another, and to the mission of the firm.So we kept going.Five years later, it’s still happening. Same time, same cadence. And 150 to 200 people still show up each week, not because they’re required to, but because it helps them feel part of the whole. It gives every employee-owner a shared understanding of where we are, what matters, and how we move forward—together.What makes it workWe keep the structure simple. Cameras off. Everyone muted. I open with announcements—anniversaries, new hires, birth announcements. I follow with business updates—new projects, financial performance, upcoming changes. Then I turn the mic over to others. We might hear from someone who just earned a professional license, someone who led a major client win, or a leader of a team running an internal initiative.We celebrate. We explain. We clarify. And we end with a “safety moment”—a few words to keep well-being top of mind, whether that’s workplace hazards, seasonal considerations in the field (“It’s tick season,” “Watch for black ice”), or just an acknowledgment of what people might be navigating outside of work.I prepare the meeting myself each week, often late Thursday night. I gather the latest updates from across our 18 locations and I check in with our senior leadership team to see if there’s anything they’d like to add. Sometimes the meeting is lighthearted. Sometimes it’s serious. But it’s always honest. And increasingly, it’s a platform for others to lead too.The perks of proactive communicationToo many leaders wait until there’s a crisis to communicate. They stay silent until something goes wrong, then call an emergency all-hands. And everyone’s first thought is, “What happened?”That’s exactly the dynamic we wanted to avoid.By communicating consistently, we take the sting out of surprise. There is no undue fear. If something difficult comes up—whether it’s economic headwinds or a slowdown in one part of the business—our employees have the context to understand it. They don’t have to guess. They don’t have to wonder what’s being said behind closed doors. They hear it from me.And when there’s good news—like bonuses, awards, or new hires—they hear that too. We explain decisions, not just announce them. Because when people understand the “why,” they’re more engaged in the “how.”Over time, this weekly meeting has become a cultural touchstone. New hires tell me they’ve never worked somewhere that shared this much. People working remotely or in satellite offices say it helps them feel included. And long-tenured employees often mention how much they value the consistency, even if they can’t always attend. As one employee put it: “It’s a reassurance that helps transition us into an enjoyable and optimistic weekend.”The comments I hear most often are about clarity, calm, and connection. One employee said, “You keep things steady in an unsteady world.” Another told me the calls helped them feel proud to be part of something bigger. Someone new said, “I can’t believe the CEO takes time every week to do this.” And someone else reminded me, “We’re not just listening to you. We’re learning how to lead.”That’s why we do it. Because in an employee-owned company, we all lead. And for people to lead well, they need to be informed, connected, and trusted.This half hour every week isn’t flashy. But it’s real and reliable. And in leadership, that matters.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, July 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
