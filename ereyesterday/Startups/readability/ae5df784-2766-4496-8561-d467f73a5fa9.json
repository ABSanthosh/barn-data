The average credit card interest rate, in comparison, is about 20%.Most fans bought tickets to Coachella after the festival announced its musician lineup in November, revealing that Lady Gaga, Travis Scott, Green Day, Post Malone, and Benson Boone were headliners. Anyone who bought tickets before Jan. 25 and opted for the payment plan had the price of their ticket divided into three equal payments, with the final payment deducted from the attendee's account in March, per Billboard.If payments were more than 10 days late, the order was automatically cancelled and the fan given a credit for future festivals.
