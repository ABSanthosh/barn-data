The deployment of renewables has been impressive in recent years, but it still needs to ramp up if we’re going to achieve these ambitious targets. Glint Solar has a solution that it believes can help. Founded back in 2020, the Norwegian startup is on a mission to speed up the adoption of solar power around the world. To do this, the Norwegian startup has developed software that can rapidly identify and evaluate promising locations for utility-scale solar projects, empowering solar energy developers to accelerate the creation of new energy projects with greater efficiency. The technology quickly analyses thousands of potential sites, and developers can search the interactive mapping platform to spot opportunities and avoid sub-optimal locations that would hinder profitable energy generation. The intuitive platform is designed to work with geographic information systems (GIS) tools, and Glint Solar’s user-friendly software can also be used to plan and visualise layouts for solar parks in 3D. To help streamline project development, everything from layouts and analyses to site photos, contracts, and other crucial documentation can all be conveniently stored on the platform. Glint Solar Content Manager Matthew Sveum Stubbs shared with Springwise that 74 per cent of development hours are often wasted on stalled solar projects. Instead, Glint Solar “redefines initial project stages, enabling users to triple their solar pipeline, unlock layouts 10 times faster, and boost their conversions by 30 per cent”. In focusing on the early stages of project development, which often come with bottlenecks and time-wasting inefficiencies, Glint Solar can rapidly speed up how fast an area can start generating clean solar power. Last month, Glint Solar completed an $8 million series A funding round led by Smedvig Ventures. Moving forward, Stubbs told Springwise that the company plans to continue driving disruption in solar, double its team, and extend its software to include battery energy storage systems (BESS) development.
