Between 2011-2013 and 2017-2021, Kobus received over $1.2 million in income from these fishing trips. Despite the substantial income, he failed to file federal income tax returns or pay the taxes owed.To evade paying taxes, Kobus regularly cashed his paychecks and used the cash for personal expenses, hiding the source and disposition of his income from the IRS. His actions resulted in a tax loss to the IRS totaling approximately $377,839.90.In addition to his prison sentence, U.S. District Court Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton for the District of Massachusetts ordered Kobus to serve one year of supervised release and to pay $377,839.90 in restitution to the United States.The case was announced by Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M.
