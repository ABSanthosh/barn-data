If there is one you think I would like, please let me know. These are my top albums from 2024. How do I define “top albums from 2024”? Easy. “Album” means a new release from an artist in the classic full-length record sense. No greatest-hits compilations, half-assed singles, or three-track EPs. (Live albums are A-OK.) “2024” means it was released in the 2024 calendar year. “Top” means most times played according to Plex and Roon running on the Mac mini in my office closet. Why? Because Spotify and YouTube are for discovering and browsing. Plex and Roon are for listening to music that has graduated to “stuff I care about”. Put another way, music I bought with real money. (Also, my streaming music stats are all shot-to-hell because of my day job.) With that out of the way, here’s my top 10, in no-particular order. Joey Valence \u0026 Brae: No Hands Goose: Live at the Fox Theatre Oliver Wood: Fat Cat Silhouette The Dare: What’s Wrong With New York? Yard Act: Where’s My Utopia Elbow: Audio Vertigo The Last Dinner Party: Prelude to Ecstasy IDLES: TANGK The Sleeveens: The Sleeveens Amyl and the Sniffers: Cartoon Darkness I’m not sure what to make of that list other than to notice it’s a much louder collection of artists than in past years. Why louder? Well, \u003cgestures wildly at the world\u003e (A benefit of living in Nashville is an endless supply of live music. From the list above, I saw Joey Valence \u0026 Brae, IDLES, Oliver Wood, The Sleeveens, and Yard Act. Each one, a fantastic show. Highly recommended if they tour near you.)",
