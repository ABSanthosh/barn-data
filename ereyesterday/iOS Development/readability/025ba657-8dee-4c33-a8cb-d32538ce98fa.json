  "description": "This Thursday, Oct. 17, 2024, is the 20th anniversary of the Seattle Xcoders! We’d love to see you there, at 7 pm at Bale Breaker and Yonder Cider taproom in Ballard. Everyone is welcome! It’s not just for people who write code — it’s for designers, testers, support folks, and everyone who helps make Apple-ecosystem apps. Even if you just like those kinds of apps and like talking about them, come join us! We’re usually outside by these propane fire things, but I’m not sure this time — we might have a room or some area or something. We should be easy to find, at any rate. It’s not actually a meeting with presentations — it’s just hanging out and talking. Which we do every first, third, and fifth Thursday (you can subscribe to our calendar). One of these days we’ll get back to presentations — but the social part is valuable, and so we keep it up. PS Looks like the food truck is Impeckable Chicken, which I’ve heard good things about. :) PPS I’m usually easy to spot: quite well into middle age, with nothing like the amount of hair I once had. Black jeans, usually a black sweatshirt. Glasses. Doc Martens. Not tall.",
