The Turing test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. From the 1940s 1 to the 2010s people programmed computers, and computers could only do what they were programmed to do in a rules-based deterministic manner. Sometimes a person would program the computer and it would do something unexpected, but 100 out of 100 times the computer was doing what it was programmed to do whether the person liked it or not. While there has been experimentation with what today we call AI since the 1950s, those machines were a long ways away from passing the Turing test. Why does using ChatGPT feel more like a conversation with the smartest person you know than a computer? It's because ChatGPT doesn't solve problems deterministically the way a programmed computer does, it solves them probabilistically. 2 ChatGPT demonstrates the ability to think about something in a logical, sensible way, the definition of reasoning. 3 We've created something completely new here, a reasoning computer. 4",

    "title": "My Home Automation setup",
    "link": "https://swiftrocks.com/my-home-automation-setup",
    "description": "I recently upgraded my smart home hardware, and I felt like writing a post describing my current setup to serve as inspiration for those wanting to get started or just interested in home automation in general. The Software I use Home Assistant OS like many others. The way I like to describe HA is that it's an Alexa on steroids. With an Alexa, you buy smart devices, link them with the Alexa, and then setup automations to control those devices based on conditions like time, weather, and so on. But the problem with Alexas is that 1) the devices must support Alexas specifically, and 2) the automations themselves are very limited, only allowing you to do simple things. Home Assistant doesn't have such limitations. HA is open-source and has a thriving community, meaning you can find plugins that enable integrations for pretty much anything you can think of, and if you don't, you can build such plugins yourself assuming you have the programming chops to do it! HA is very extensible, and thus perfect for power users who want to set up complex automations or integrate unusual devices in unusual ways. The Hardware For a long time, my setup used to be a simple Raspberry Pi 3b and a SD card. The HA community tells you that this is a bad idea (The 3b is weak and SD cards can die if you use them too much), but in my experience this is fine as long as you don't have too many devices / automations / integrations. It's a good starting point, and it did the trick for me for a couple of years until I started wanting to do more complicated integrations. Nowadays, I've retired the 3b in favor of a Raspberry Pi 5 w/ 8GB RAM, with a 256GB official RPi NVMe SSD and enclosed on the Argon One V3 case. This gives HA enough power and cooling to do everything that I need with ease. The way I run the server is via WiFi. The community says that this is also a bad idea and that you should use a wired connection to prevent latency issues, but I never had any such issues running HA via WiFi. For voice control, I use an Alexa. The way this works is that HA has a plugin called Emulated Hue which allows you to trick an Alexa into thinking your HA server is a Philips Hue hub, allowing you to expose your devices and scripts to the Alexa in order to make use of its voice features. But you can also pay for HA Cloud and enjoy the official \"proper\" Alexa integration, which I don't because I want to keep everything running on the local network. I also have a Sonoff ZBDongle-E USB stick plugged into the server in order to drive my Zigbee devices, which I'll mention in more detail further below. The Protocol Currently, I'm running a combination of WiFi and Zigbee devices, which is an alternate wireless protocol made specifically to be used by IoT devices that uses less energy and lays off a mesh network where the devices communicate with each other (as opposed to WiFi devices where everything goes through the router, thus creating a star network). The reason I run this mix is just because I didn't know about Zigbee in the beginning. If I could go back in time, I would have the entire network consist of Zigbee devices because I think they are just better than WiFi ones overall. It uses significantly less energy (many Zigbee devices can run on those coin cell batteries), the mesh network allows you to have devices very far away from the server, and best of all: they work even when the WiFi is down. When you buy Zigbee devices, usually the store will say that you need a hub to drive them, which they also sell. It's true that you need a hub, but it doesn't have to be that store's specific hub. When using something like HA, you can use a USB antenna stick like the one mentioned above and that will allow you to control any Zigbee device from any manufacturer via HA. The Devices Here are the IoT devices that I have around my apartment, excluding things that are \"smart\" by default like TVs and such. Sonoff Basic R2 (WiFi) This is a DIY WiFi switch that you hook into \"dumb\" devices in order to be able to make them smart and turn them on and off via WiFi. Given a bit of skill with electronics (stripping / crimping wires), these switches are much cheaper and more durable compared to buying smart lamps, and I have many of these spread around the apartment! By default, these require you to expose your device to some awful Chinese cloud server. Luckily for us, you can flash these devices with custom firmware like Tasmota, allowing you to have full control of them. This also requires skills with electronics and some special equipment, so keep that in mind. As previously mentioned, If I could go back in time, I would have instead bought these switches' Zigbee equivalent to make things easier and better, so I'm in the process of replacing them. Sonoff S26 R2 (WiFi) This is the same as above, but as something that you plug directly into the wall socket, thus requiring no messing with wires unless you want to flash the firmware to stop China from spying on you. If I could back in time, I would have bought these IKEA wall sockets instead, as they run on Zigbee and can even provide data on your electrical consumption, so these are also something I'll be replacing soon. Broadlink RM4C mini This is a WiFi IR blaster that you can configure IR commands and thus be able to create automations that allow you to control devices that require a remote control, like your TV. In my case it turned out that newer Samsung TVs have some sort of API integration where you can control them over the web, but I used these blasters for a long time before I discovered this. This also puts your device on some Chinese cloud though, and in this case I'm not sure if custom firmwares are available. Random IKEA IoT utilities IKEA has lots of IoT devices like buttons, remote controls, motion detectors, temperature thingies, and more. They are all Zigbee and thus very easy to connect to use. I think only the button and the remote control took a bit more effort because you need to find out exactly how they work in order to build automations against them in HA, but nothing that a simple Google search couldn't solve.",

    "title": "What happens when you move a file in git?",
    "link": "https://swiftrocks.com/what-happens-when-you-move-a-file-in-git",
    "description": "Recently at work we were considering renaming a folder that contains an enormous amount of files, and we wondered whether or not that would have notable negative consequences for our git repository. Would the repo become considerably larger? Would accessing git history become slower? Or would this be completely fine? After investigating this, I thought the answer was interesting enough that I felt like writing an article about it. To answer this question, we need to briefly explain how git works under the hood. There's also a TL;DR at the bottom if you'd like to skip the entire explanation. How does git handle files? It's somewhat commonly believed that git's commits are diffs, but this is not true. Commits are snapshots of your repository, meaning that when you make changes to a file, git will store a full copy of that file on your repository (there is an important exception, but let's keep it simple for now). This is why you can easily switch between commits and branches no matter how old they are; git doesn't need to \"replay\" thousands of diffs, it just needs to read and apply the snapshot for the commit you're trying to access. Under the hood, git will store all different versions of your files in the .git/objects folder, and this is something we can play with in order to find out what will happen regarding the main question we're trying to answer. Let's make a new git repo and add a file called swiftrocks.txt with the Hello World! contents, and commit it: git init echo 'Hello World!' \u003e swiftrocks.txt git add swiftrocks.txt git commit -m \"Add SwiftRocks\" If you now go to .git/objects, you'll see a bunch of folders with encoded files inside of them. The file we just added is there, but which one? When you add a file to git, git will do the following things: Compress the file with zlib Calculate a SHA1 hash based on the contents Place it in .git/objects/(first two hash characters)/(remaining hash characters) We can locate our file in the objects folder by reproducing this process, and luckily for us, we don't have to code anything to achieve this. We can find out what the resulting hash for a given file would be by running git hash-object: git hash-object swiftrocks.txt 980a0d5f19a64b4b30a87d4206aade58726b60e3 In my case, the hash of the file was 980a0d5f19a64b4b30a87d4206aade58726b60e3, meaning I can find the \"stored\" version of that file in .git/objects/98/0a0d5f19a64b4b30a87d4206aade58726b60e3. If you do this however, you'll notice that the file is unreadable because it's compressed. Similarly to the previous case, we don't have to code anything to de-compress this file! We just need to run git cat-file -p and git will do so automatically for us: git cat-file -p 980a0d5f19a64b4b30a87d4206aade58726b60e3 Hello World! There it is! Let's now make a change to this file and see what happens: echo 'Hello World (changed)!' \u003e swiftrocks.txt git add swiftrocks.txt git commit -m \"Change swiftrocks.txt\" git hash-object swiftrocks.txt cf15f0bb6b07a66f78f6de328e3cd6ea2747de6b git cat-file -p cf15f0bb6b07a66f78f6de328e3cd6ea2747de6b Hello World (changed)! Since we've made a change to the file, the SHA1 of the compressed contents changed, leading to a full copy of that file being added to the objects folder. As already mentioned above, this is because git works primarily in terms of snapshots rather than file diffs. You can even see that the \"original\" file is still there, which is what allows git to quickly switch between commits / branches. git cat-file -p 980a0d5f19a64b4b30a87d4206aade58726b60e3 Hello World! # The original file is still there! Now here's the relevant part: What happens if we change our file back to its original contents? echo 'Hello World!' \u003e swiftrocks.txt git add swiftrocks.txt git commit -m \"Change swiftrocks.txt back\" git hash-object swiftrocks.txt 980a0d5f19a64b4b30a87d4206aade58726b60e3 The hash is the same as before! Even though this is a new commit making a new change to the file, the hashing process allows git to determine that the file is exactly the same as the one we had in previous commits, meaning that there's no need to create a new copy. This will be the case even if you rename the file, because the hash is calculated based on the contents, not the file's name. This is a great finding, but it doesn't fully answer the original question. We now know that renaming files will not result in new copies of those files being added to the objects folder, but what about folders? And how are those files and folders attached to actual commits? How does git handle folders (and commits)? The most useful thing to know right off the bat is that commits are also objects in git. This is why you might have seen other folders / files in .git/objects when first inspecting it; the other files were related to the commits you made when adding the file. Since commits are also objects, we can read them with git cat-file just like with \"regular\" files. Let's do it with our latest commit (26d4302 in my case): git cat-file -p 26d4302 tree 350cef2a8054111568f82dc87bbd683ee14bb1a6 parent 2891fe1393c9e1bff116c1b58a30bcf85e0596a8 author Bruno Rocha 1733136171 +0100 committer Bruno Rocha 1733136223 +0100 Change swiftrocks.txt back As you can see, a \"commit\" is nothing more than a small text file containing the following bits of information: The author of the commit, and the commit message The hash of the parent commit The hash of the commit's \"tree\", containing information about the file system snapshot for that particular commit In this case, what we're interested in is the last point. Luckily for us, trees are also objects in git. Thus, if we want to see what the file system looks like for that particular commit, we just need to run git cat-file -p against the commit's tree hash: git cat-file -p 350cef2a8054111568f82dc87bbd683ee14bb1a6 100644 blob 980a0d5f19a64b4b30a87d4206aade58726b60e3 swiftrocks.txt Like with commits, tree objects are also very simple text files. In this case, the tree states that there's only one file (a blob) in the repository, which is a file called swiftrocks.txt with the 980a0d5f... hash. We've already uncovered that git prevents individual files from being duped, but let's see how this is reflected in the tree object: (made a commit adding some copies, and did cat-file -p on the new commit / tree) 100644 blob 980a0d5f19a64b4b30a87d4206aade58726b60e3 swiftrocks.txt 100644 blob 980a0d5f19a64b4b30a87d4206aade58726b60e3 swiftrocks2.txt 100644 blob 980a0d5f19a64b4b30a87d4206aade58726b60e3 swiftrocks3.txt The tree object references the new copies and their different names, but as expected, their hashes all point to the same underlying object under the hood. If we add folders to our repository, the tree object will include references to other tree objects (related to each of those folders), allowing you to recursively inspect each folder of that commit's snapshot. Here's an example: 100644 blob dd99cb611e0c77b2214392b253ed555fb838d8ee .DS_Store 040000 tree 350cef2a8054111568f82dc87bbd683ee14bb1a6 folder1 040000 tree 11ca8c2fe64b078be34824f071d32a560aba62a7 folder2 100644 blob 980a0d5f19a64b4b30a87d4206aade58726b60e3 swiftrocks.txt As you can see above, the output directly identifies what each hash is so that you know exactly what you're looking at. (An alternative is to run git cat-file -t, which returns the \"type\" for a given object hash.) So what happens if you rename / move an entire folder? The important bit to know here is that tree objects (and commits) are calculated and stored just like regular file (blob) objects, meaning they follow the same rules. This means that if the contents of two folders are exactly the same, git will not create a new tree object for those folders; it will simply reuse the hash it had already computed in the past, just like in the case of files: 040000 tree 350cef2a8054111568f82dc87bbd683ee14bb1a6 folder1 040000 tree 350cef2a8054111568f82dc87bbd683ee14bb1a6 folder1 (copy) However, since tree objects contain references to a folder / file's name, renaming something can result in new tree objects being created for that folder / file's parent tree in order to account for the name change, resulting in new hashes and tree objects recursively all the way up to the root of the repository. This will also be the case when moving files / folders. The above snippet is one example of this. Even though git was able to avoid duplicating the internal contents of folder1, git still needed to generate a new tree object for its parent in order to account for the fact that a new folder called folder1 (copy) exists. If there are more parents up the chain, they would also require new tree objects. Whether or not this would be a problem depends on where exactly the change is being made. If the change is too \"deep\" into the filesystem and / or the affected trees contain a massive number of files then you'd end up with lots of potentially large new tree objects. Still, as you can see, tree objects are quite simple, so you'd need a truly gargantuan repository and / or unfortunate folder setup for this to be an actual problem. If you do have a setup that is bad enough for this to be an issue, then the good thing is that there are ways to improve it. By understanding how tree objects are created and which files change / move more often in your repo, it's possible to optimize the structure of your repository to minimize the \"blast radius\" of any given change. For example, placing files that change very often closer to the root of the repo could reduce the number of trees that would have to be regenerated and their overall size. (Bonus) When are commits not snapshots? At the beginning of this article, I mentioned that there are cases where commits are not snapshots. While this is not particularly relevant for this article, I wanted to briefly cover this as it's an important aspect of how git works. We've seen that git will make copies of your files when you change them, but this introduces a massive problem: If a particular file happens to be really big, then duplicating it for every small change could be disastrous. When this is the case, git will pivot into calculating change deltas instead of making full copies of the file. This feature is called Packfiles, and is something that is automatically managed by git for you. I recommend reading this great write-up by Aditya Mukerjee if you'd like to know more about it. TL;DR Git works in terms of snapshots (for the most part) Git knows that two files are the same and can avoid duplicating them in its internal storage, even if they have different names Similarly, Git can also determine if two folders are the same, regardless of where they are or are named Thus, renaming files or folders will not have any impact on git's internal storage for those files and folders However, git may end up needing to duplicate information regarding parent folders, recursively, to account for naming changes and / or new files In theory this can be an issue if the change happens very \"deeply\" into the file system and / or the parent folders contain massive amounts of files, but you'd need a truly gargantuan repository and / or unfortunate folder setup for this to be an actual problem Understanding how git objects work under the hood allows you to optimize your repository's folders in ways that can prevent too many unnecessary objects from being created Sources / References Julia Evans's many articles on git Unpacking git packfiles Git from the inside out",

    "link": "https://useyourloaf.com/blog/reducing-motion-of-animations/",
    "description": "Reduce or disable animations when the user requests you to reduce motion in the device accessibility settings. What’s the problem? Apple’s Human Interface Guide has some guidelines when applying motion to your user interface: Don’t add motion for the sake of adding motion. Gratuitous or excessive animation can distract people and may make them feel disconnected or physically uncomfortable. They also suggest making motion optional: Not everyone can or wants to experience the motion in your app or game, so it’s essential to avoid using it as the only way to communicate important information. When you do apply motion you need to be aware when it can be problematic for users. Apple highlights a number of situations: Oscillating motions, especially with large amplitudes and frequencies around 0.2 Hz (one oscillation every five seconds). For spatial interfaces like visionOS, head-locked content with rapid camera motion. Large animations that simulate objects flying in or out of the screen. Reduce Motion Accessibility Setting A user can request to reduce the motion of the user interface in the device accessibility settings: The system can take the setting into account when applying standard view transitions (but I’ve not found this documented anywhere). For example, the zoom navigation transition (new in iOS 18) creates the effect of the view flying towards/away from you which can be a problem. That automatically falls back to a standard navigation transition when you choose reduce motion. For custom animations you need to take the appropriate action yourself by disabling or replacing problematic motion. Detecting Reduce Motion The reduce motion setting is available in the environment for SwiftUI views: @Environment(\\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion The documentation offers us a hint on how to react: If this property’s value is true, UI should avoid large animations, especially those that simulate the third dimension. Note: For UIKit, listen for the notification reduceMotionStatusDidChangeNotification. Disabling Animations I find it convenient to create animations as a computed property that takes the reduce motion state into account. For example, to disable the animation: struct MyView: View { @Environment(\\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion private var linearAnimation: Animation? { guard !reduceMotion else { return nil } return Animation.linear(duration: 0.3) } } Then when applying the animation using the computed property. A value of nil disables the animation: .onTapGesture { withAnimation(linearAnimation) { enabled.toggle() } } You don’t have to always disable the animation, as with the zoom transition you could replace an animation with a less problematic version. The point to remember is that it’s not automatic for your own animations. You need to decide when and how to respond.

    "title": "Swift Parameterized Testing",
    "link": "https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swift-parameterized-testing/",
    "description": "Apple introduced Swift Testing at WWDC24. One of the interesting features is the ability to pass arguments to a test function. Parameterized Testing The Swift Testing @Test macro has an arguments parameter which accepts a collection of values: @Test(\"Even Value\", arguments: [2, 8, 50]) func even(value: Int) { #expect(value.isMultiple(of: 2)) } Swift Testing calls the test function once for each value in the arguments collection. The Test Navigator shows the results of each of the test runs: If you pass a second argument, Swift Testing generates test cases for all combinations of the two arguments: @Test(\"Product is even\", arguments: [2, 8, 50], [3, 6, 9]) func productEven(value: Int, multiplier: Int) { let product = value * multiplier #expect(product.isMultiple(of: 2)) } The Test Navigator shows nine test results covering all combinations of the input arguments: You’re limited to at most two arguments. If you don’t need every combination you can zip the arguments to pair them: @Test(\"Product is even\", arguments: zip([2, 8, 50], [3, 6, 9])) func productEven(value: Int, multiplier: Int) { let product = value * multiplier #expect(product.isMultiple(of: 2)) } The Test Navigator now shows this test running three times with consecutive pairs of arguments: That all makes for a good demo but how useful is it in practise? Migrating from XCTest I recently migrated some XCTest based unit tests to Swift Testing. I was happy to find examples where I could use parameters to either combine or simplify tests. The parameter based testing works best when you have a collection of input arguments for which you expect the same result. I’ve found this extra convenient when you can organise the input data as a CaseIterable enum that can drive the tests. For example, I like to verify the attributes of each property in my Core Data managed object classes. This protects me from accidentally renaming or changing the type of the property in the Core Data model editor. I have the attributes of each Core Data class listed as enums organised by type. For example, a Country has these String attributes: enum StringAttribute: String, CaseIterable { case capital case name case continent case currency } A test to verify each of these string attributes: private let entityName = \"Country\" private let container: NSPeristentContainer @Test( \"Verify String attributes\", arguments: Country.StringAttribute.allCases) func stringAttributes(_ name: Country.StringAttribute) throws { let entity = try #require( container.managedObjectModel.entitiesByName[entityName]) let attribute = try #require(entity.attributesByName[name.rawValue]) #expect(attribute.type == .string) } I’m yet to find a practical example for when I need all combinations of two arguments though I have some situations where I’ve found zip’ing two arguments useful. Why Bother? I can write the previous test without arguments using a for-loop to iterate over the enum cases. The Swift Testing approach with parameters has some advantages: Each call of the test function with a different argument is an independent test case than can run in parallel. It’s much clearer when a test case fails. You can also rerun just the failing argument from the test navigator by clicking on the red failure icon: Learn More Migrating XCTest to Swift Testing WWDC24 Go further with Swift Testing Swift Parameterized Testing was originally posted 06 Jan 2025 on useyourloaf.com.
