    "description": "“Our job isn’t to remove complexity, but to manage it”- Glen Murphy (as remembered by Dan) In this episode, we talk with Dan Sandler and Adam Cohen from the SystemUI team. We dip into a bit of history, talking about where things were at when they joined the team (2009-10), and how things have developed in the many years since, including how these projects and teams scaled from a single person working on it part-time to now having much larger teams doing many more things. Which kind of describes software development in general.  We also talk about how to expose (or not) gestures and features in a UI system. Related: there are some bonus pro-tips on using some hidden features of System UI, as a prize for careful listeners and podcast hosts.

We talk about the current state of the library, but also about some of the design decisions that went into developing the APIs and functionality. (Note on the audio quality for this episode - it turns out that mixing so many people, all of whom recorded themselves separately using very different hardware and setups was... tricky.

Quotes of note: \"My memory doesn't work that way.\" \"Just because you have power doesn't mean you should use it.\" Subscribe to the podcast feed or download the audio file directly.

    "description": "Tor and Chet talk with Raph Levien from the Android UI Toolkit team, who works on font technology for Android. The conversation wanders freely into areas such as Raph's creation of the Inconsolata font, his work on Ghostscript, and tinkering he's done with audio latency and Android synthesizer apps. Oh, and we also talk about fonts, including some big improvements to font support in the Android 5.0 Lollipop release. We also learned some new terminology along the way: glitch (the audio equivalent of jank in the graphics and UI world) and pangram (a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet). So, bonus points for educational content. Subscribe to the podcast feed or download the audio file directly.

    "link": "http://www.fragmentedpodcast.com",
    "description": "In this episode of our podcast, we explore the diverse landscape of Java versions within the Android ecosystem. Our guest is Michael Bailey, a seasoned Java expert who has been a frequent presence on our show since the early days of our podcast. We kick off with a solid foundation, discussing the differences between JDK and JRE, as well as the distinctions between the available Java JDKs. We also guide listeners through Android Studio settings, exploring how to select a suitable JDK, its utilization, and how it relates to JAVA_VERSION on one's home path/terminal.As we dig deeper, we start to unpack some of the crucial Android app settings. From compileOptions to sourceCompatibility/targetCompatibility, we shed light on why these versions are important. We also demystify the compileSdk vs minSdk vs targetSdk, and how they interconnect. Drawing from Kaushiks's recent experience in building a new app, we provide real-life examples that can better clarify these topics for our listeners.We conclude the episode by providing some valuable resources for further understanding and exploration.

Our conversation will begin by shedding light on the importance of modularization, what triggers the need for breaking projects into multiple modules, and how modularization relates to team size, feature teams, and code ownership. This discussion is aimed at demystifying how and why developers often choose to modularize their applications.As we move forward, we'll dive into more advanced aspects of modularization, such as the challenges of scaling and the potential missteps in over-modularization. Drawing on real-world experiences, we'll examine the red flags that signal a need for revising your modularization strategy. This part of our discussion will also highlight some specific tools and techniques that can help manage and visualize your project's modularization, and Siggi will share his own experiences and insights into how these tools have assisted in his modularization strategy.In the final part of the episode, we'll touch on the benefits and strategies of proper modularization. Siggi will share practical advice on how to tackle big projects, fix issues with modularization, and make a smooth transition from monolithic to modular structures. We'll also talk about some tools that can be handy in this process.

    "description": "In this podcast episode, we have the pleasure to host Fred Porciúncula, a Google Developer Expert (GDE) known for his work with Kotlin Inject and his invaluable contributions to the Android development community. Fred offers his expertise on Dependency Injection (DI), Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), and how they intersect.We kick off the conversation by discussing Dependency Injection (DI), its importance, and the options available to developers, including Dagger, Hilt, Anvil, Koin, and Kotlin-Inject. Fred explains the use and impact of DI in the Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) world, considering Dagger’s current lack of KMP support and debating whether one should use separate DI tools for Android apps and KMP components.Delving further into Kotlin-Inject, we explore its features, usage, and how it differentiates itself from other DI solutions. Topics discussed include its unique handling of Scopes, its support of constructor injection, and its utility in building dependency graphs. Furthermore, we examine the timeless debate of Dependency Injection versus Service Locator.Toward the end of the episode, Fred presents his thoughts on the advantages and disadvantages of exclusively using Kotlin-Inject throughout an application. We also tackle the concept of “Vanilla Injection” - refraining from using DI libraries at all.For further learning, we recommend resources like Fred's insightful article on transitioning from Dagger/Hilt to Kotlin-Inject, a Dagger issue discussing KSP support, and a Kotlin-Inject discussion on Anvil-like features.

You'll specify a matching pattern and users, or teams that own that pattern of files and they will be required to review the PR before it can be merged.

    "description": "In this episode Donn and Kaushik talk about frustration, finding \"flow state\" and how it's known as \"the madness\" and how to deal with it.We originally were going to talk about an other topic, but during the off air banter Donn brought up how he was frustrated with losing/burning so much time on a task that he had for his side project. He only meant to spend a little bit of time on it and then spent WAY more time than he meant to. He got to the point where he had to stop working on the project, yell at himself for not time boxing it and then he had to refocus. This piqued Kaushik's interest and they decided to hit record to talk about this topic as its something they both deal with and have also hear many other developers deal with too. The \"Madness\" is when you get consumed by your work and you're so passionate that you lose track of time, eating and more. You've become consumed ... you have \"The Madness\". This happens to all developers, and Donn and Kaushik talk about how to not let this derail your day when you have other responsibilities as well as life and work.

    "description": "In this episode, Kaushik peppers Donn with questions about his foray into Android Turbo, Hotwire, and the concept of \"Native Where You Need It\".Donn recently launched Android Jumpstart, the Android client for the Jumpstart Rails trifecta. Jumpstart Rails allow you to launch your SaaS business much faster than if you were to do it from the ground up.The Android client for Jumpstart Rails builds on top of Turbo and Hotwire, two technologies that help power the Hey email client and Basecamp (the project management app). By using Turbo and Hotwire you're able to get very fast response times and speed with \"HTML Over the Wire\" (aka Hotwire) with Websockets and much more. This allows your web app to be super fast and when packaged with Android Turbo, allows your web app to live within a native shell. HOWEVER, this doesn't mean its simply a web wrapper. With Android Turbo you can specify which URL routes you'd like to be as native and which ones you'd like to remain web-based. This means you can choose to use Native when you need it, and delegate back to the web for everything else.This is the solo founder, indie-hacker, and startup SaaS dream come true. You can come to market faster, iterate with a smaller team and get native benefits when and where you need it, all while also allowing your application to be flexible in a web manner.If you're thinking about building a SaaS app that needs a web presence, Android and iOS presence but want fully native experiences in certain areas then this will be the episode for you.LinksHotwired.devStimulus JSJumpstart AndroidJumpstart RailsJumpstart iOSEpisode 220 with Jay Ohms - Turbo Native for AndroidGo Rails TutorialsDonn's Git CourseNeed to learn Git?

    "description": "In this episode Donn talks about why you need to learn React (or Flutter) - so you can truly understand the Unidirectional data flow pattern in a framework that was built for that purpose alone.Working with other frameworks which bolt on a custom unidirectional data flow is often hard to understand. When you work with React and learn how it works, the concept of Unidirectional data flow starts to make much more sense as that is the default way to implement UI's in technologies like React (and Flutter).This exposes you to the pattern and helps you understand it. In turn, this will help you become a better developer.Show NotesUnidirectional Data flow ImageHow to learn React:Tyler McGinnis Course on React (this is how I learned it)Tyler McGinnis React Hooks CourseHow to Learn FlutterRohan Taneja's Flutter from Zero to Hero Course (Free)Flutter Crash CourseDonn's Free E-Book on Freelancing RatesFree E-Book on Freelancing RatesContact@fragmentedcast or our Youtube channel@donnfelker and donnfelker (on Instagram)Freelancing for Mobile Developers (Donn's YouTube)kaushikgopal (on YouTube) or blog.kaush.co or @kaushikgopalDisclaimer: Many of the links we share to products are affiliate links.

Gordon is a wiz in general but his knowledge of git goes deep. So in this episode, KG goes solo and really dives in-depth about how git works. Buckle up and listen on; you'll come out on the outer side with a much sounder understanding of git. Shownotes Plumbing and Porcelain commands git gc vs prune Objects which are no longer referenced can be evicted with git prune; though this is a low-level operation which is often called from git gc. By default it will not remove commits newer than 2 weeks old, and of course the commits that are reachable from that; so provided the branch (or tag) deleted has recent commits, it will stay around in the git repository for up two a fortnight afterwards.

What Kotlin does do is force you to think about how you want to handle your nulls. through Kotlin forcing you to think this through, the hope is that you'll avoid NullPointerExceptions. The only problem is, Kotlin has the !! operator, also known as the \"Not Null Assertion Operator\". This operator basically says \"Hey Kotlin, trust me, I'm a pro, I know what I'm doing ... I KNOW THIS WON'T BE NULL\". This... is a code smell. In this episode, Donn walks through why Kotlin's Not Null Assertion Operator (!!) is a code smell and what you can do to alleviate it.

    "description": "In this episode, Donn talks about Kotlin Lambda Expressions. He explains the syntax and how to build a couple of simple lambda expressions with and without type inference and declaration. We wrap up with a small example of passing a small lambda with multiple values to a function. See the show notes below for more info. This is part 1 of a multi-part series on Lambda Expressions in Kotlin. The basic syntax of a lambda expression: val myLambda : Type = { argumentList -\u003e codeBody } The codeBody is the only section that is not optional. Double lambda expression (doubles an integer) with type inference val double = { number: Int -\u003e number * 2 } val result = double(4) // result = 8 now Double string multi-line lambda with type inference. val doubleString = { number: Int -\u003e // codebody val doubleResult = number * 2 doubleResult.toString() // Kotlin knows this will return a string } Type declaration in a lambda val myLambda: (String, Int) -\u003e String = { str, int -\u003e \"$str - ${int.toString()}\" // \"Donn - 32\" } val result = myLambda(\"Donn\", 32) // result = \"Donn - 32\" Preview of next week … passing a lambda to a function fun doWork(name: String, favoriteNumber: Int, someLambda: (String, Int) -\u003e String) { // Do some processing, this is a contrived example val repeatedString = \"$name$name\" val result = someLambda(repeatedString, favoriteNumber) println(result) } // Usage doWork(\"Donn\", 32) { str, int -\u003e val someNewValue = \"$str is my parameter and so is $int\" someNewValue.length.toString() // this is returned } // '37' is printed via println // Or use it like this, the lambda code body is what can change, this is where the power is at doWork(\"Donn\", 32) { name, count -\u003e var result = \"\" for(i in 1..count) { result += \"$name\" } result // this is returned } // loops over and concatinates \"Donn\" until the favorite number (aka count) is met. // Output looks like: \"DonnDonnDonnDonnDonnDonn...\" and so on...",

He explains how static code analysis works, how Uber leverages these tools in their app development pipeline and how we can use such tools to build high quality Android apps. Note from Manu: I found the story I was thinking about: Reed Hastings founded the company that built the Purify tool for debugging memory errors in C programs before founding Netflix. But, that's actually not a static analysis tool; it does dynamic analysis by adding extra metadata at runtime. As far as the history of lint goes, from Wikipedia looks like Kaushik's guess was exactly right as to why it's called lint. Looks like the name goes back to the late 1970s.

The paging library is a powerful take on implementing paging functionality in general, not necessarily linked to a paritcular technology or library. Florina breaks down the different components and explains what specific function each of them play. We start off with DataSources, talk about when one would want to use \"Tiled\" or \"Keyed\" data sources, and then talk about making them work with RecyclerViews (which is really what 99% of us eventually want). Florina also explains the role of PagedLists, PagedListAdapters and so much more. If you ever wanted to get an overarching veiw of Google's first take on implementing the paging library, this is a great starting point. Listen on so you can understand, try it out and then give feedback to Google, to participate in the making of this new library.

Room was introduced as part of the Android Architecture components and has been picking up a lot of steam in the community. Room focuses on being a beautiful api layer to Sqlite. Florina explains to us how we can use Room to create a database, creating entities and how them map to tables, using DAOs to access data and even observe them Listen on for the details!

A: There's only 1 reflection call (at the time of finding the database implementation, when you call Room.builder). Most of the other stuff is generated code (with compile time verification!). Q: Does Room provide compile-time SQL checks A: Yes, Room was designed to provide compile-time checks. Q: Does Room handle SQL injection attacks (security) Yes ... for all practical purposes. See this post for times when it doesn't. Q: Do we have tools to access the sqlite database file directly? Nope, at the moment, adb is your friend. Use that to download the file manually from your device.

We've been using RxJava over the years now and have even talked to Dan about it in previous episodes. How has our understanding of Rx use in Android changed over the years? We know some of the super standard usecases for RxJava in AndroidDev. But the important question to be asking is: when are the times we \"shouldn't\" be using RxJava? Are we over-complicating our code by shoe-horning it in different places. Concepts like functional programming and reactive state management have picked up steam again, how has this influenced our RxJava use?

Wed,Thu, Fri) Once successful, rally for full week of remote with an occasional in office visit (a day every week work two) Staying sane while working remote Donn's blog post on this topic Create a work day schedule (5am-2pm, 8am-5pm, 10am-7pm, etc) When you're done, you're done. Leave work (your office/etc). Schedule. Schedule. Schedule. Stick to a schedule. Get up at the same time Get dressed for work (no PJ's etc) Do your hair. Be presentable This is all mental Prepare for the day Get coffee/tea/water and snacks Try to limit the opportunity of distractions During the day Take a lunch, away from your desk. Go out for lunch with someone (significant other, friend, etc) at one to two times a week. Work out of the house a couple times a week, this increases our creativity. Outside of Work You need social interaction, Cabin Fever is a real thing. Exercise 3-4 times a week if possible. Group classes are perfect for this. CrossFit Martial Arts Yoga Pilates etc Communication When Remote Put 3x-4x more effort into communicating than previous. You're not visible seen so you need to be more vocal. Call SMS Blow up the Slack/Hipchat channel/etc Objective - Clear your own path Tools For remote to work effectively, everything should be considered remote. If one employee is remote, then all meetings should occur as if the team is remote. This ensures that everyone can work effectively without missing anything. Communication Group Chat Slack HipChat Video Chat Google Hangouts Skype Join.me Zoom.us Task Management Trello Jira Asana GitHub Remote for Employers Benefits from Remote workforce Much larger talent pool than the exhausted pool (or non-existent one that local). Higher quality employees/contractors/consultants for the same overhead. Remote creates much more loyal employees. You're giving them their life back and this is reciprocated. Your company becomes anti-fragile as you're able to adapt with the industry faster. You can hire in areas others cannot. On average, remote employees work harder and are more productive than their office counterparts. Less overhead! No need to pay for additional office space.

Show Notes Effective Java (2nd Edition) - Joshua Bloch Obey the general contract when overriding equals When to not override equals: Each instance of the class is inherently unique. You don't care whether the class provides a \"logical equality\" test. A superclass has already overridden equals, and the superclass behavior is appropriate for this class. The equals method implement an equivalence relation which states it must be: Reflexive Symmetric Transitive Consistent For any non-null reference x, x.equals(null) must return false. A recipe for a high-quality equals method is as such: Use the == operator to check for references to this object. Use the instanceof operator to check if the argument has the correct type  Cast to the correct type. Check all field types and corresponding field types. Finally, when done, ask yourself - is this method symmetric, transitive and consistent? Caveats Always override hashcode when you override equals Don't be too clever! Don't substitute another type for Object in the equals declaration. Contact @fragmentedcast [twitter.com] @donnfelker [twitter.com] @kaushikgopal [twitter.com]",

Show Notes Effective Java (2nd Edition) - Joshua Bloch Avoid finalizers If you don't know what they are, ignorance is bliss. If you know what they are, avoid them! Finalizers in Java != destructors in C++ (C++ counterparts to constructors). In C++ destructors you reclaim resources here (Java has GC) you also reclaim non-memory resources (use the try-finally block in Java) (unpredicatable amt of time between object becoming unreachable and finalizer being executed) Never do anything time critical in finalizer! System.gc + System.runFinalization increase chances - no guarantee System.runFinalizersOnExit + Runtime.runFinalizersOnExit are the ones that do - but they are fatally flawed Java 7 has try with resources, which is also interesting and auto-closeables. [Android] devs can only dream of these. If an uncaught exception is thrown in a finalizer, it is ignored, and the finalization abruptly terminates. Severe performance penalty for using finalizers - (one e.g.) time to create and destroy simple object goes from 5.6ns -\u003e 2400ns Only valid use: as a safety net or to terminate noncritical native resources.

Advantage: Works well for small number of parameters Disadvantage: Does NOT scale well JavaBeans Pattern - Callparameterless constructor to create the object; then call setter methods to set required parameter and each optional param of interest. Advantage: Scales well, easy (but wordy) to read resulting code Disadvantage: Allows inconsistency (if all required params not called); impossible to make classes immutable if using this pattern. Builder pattern - winner! Advantage: Simulates named optional parameters; allows immutable objects to be constructed; flexible Disadvantage: more ceremony to actually construct the Builder Class and finally use.

At this point, everyone knows they should have read this book (quadruple times). But it's a dense read and everyone could use a reading buddy. Also, what does Effective Java look like through the eyes of an Android developer? In this second installment of our Fragment (a.k.a mini-episode), we thought we'll do our listeners a favor and help with that reading. We introduce the very first of these venerable \"Items\": Consider providing static factory methods instead of constructors.

They will range from ~7-25 minutes in length and will showcase either Kaushik, myself (Donn) or both of us. In the first \"Fragment\" installment we're going to talk about Continuous Integration (CI) and Collective Code Ownership (CCO). Donn talks about what CI is, why its important and how it benefits you and your team. He then dives right into CCO and how it can be facilitated through testing.
