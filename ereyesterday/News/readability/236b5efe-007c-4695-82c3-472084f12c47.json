  "text": "Iran on Monday said it has targeted an American base in Qatar, Al-Udeid air base, the largest strategic asset of the US army in the West Asia region, with a \"devastating and powerful missile attack\" in Operation Besharat Fatah, underlining that it will \"not leave any attack on its territorial integrity, sovereignty, and national security unanswered\" under any circumstances. The attack comes in retaliation to the US bombing three nuclear sites in Iran over the weekend. \"The number of missiles used in this successful operation was equal to the number of bombs the United States used in its assault on Iran's nuclear facilities. The targeted base was also located far from urban areas and residential zones in Qatar, ensuring minimal risk to civilians,\" read a statement from the Secretariat of Iran's Supreme National Security Council. A spokesman for Iran's Armed Forces said the attacks on the American base in Qatar were carried out by the Revolutionary Guards Corps, the ideological arm of the Iranian military. \"We warn our enemies that the era of hit and run is over,\" said the spokesman.A few hours later, Trump said Iran gave the United States notice prior to shooting missiles at its military base in Qatar, which he said made it possible for no lives to be lost.\"I am pleased to report that NO Americans were harmed, and hardly any damage was done. Most importantly, they've gotten it all out of their 'system,' and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.\"Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same,\" Trump added.\"CONGRATULATIONS WORLD, IT'S TIME FOR PEACE!\" Trump added further, signalling there will be no further retaliation by the US. Few hours later, Trump announced a \"complete and total\" ceasefire between Israel and Iran, bringing the \"12 day war\" to an end. However, Iran has rejected all such claims, saying there is \"no agreement\" on ceasefire.Located southwest of Doha, Al-Udeid air base houses around 10,000 US troops and serves as the forward headquarters for US Central Command (CENTCOM). The base supports air operations, including combat aircraft and drones, and is a hub for operations in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. It covers 24 hectares (60 acres) and hosts nearly 100 aircraft.Qatar has temporarily closed its airspace, forcing planes to divert away from Doha - one of the world's busiest airports. In a post on social media, Qatar said this is part of a set of precautionary measures being taken based on developments in the region.Condemning the attack on the largest US military base in the region, hosted in the Gulf state, Qatar called it a \"flagrant violation\" of its sovereignty.\"We express the State of Qatar's strong condemnation of the attack on Al Udeid Air Base by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, and consider it a flagrant violation of the State of Qatar's sovereignty and airspace, as well as of international law,\" foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari said in a statement.Iran, say media reports, coordinated its strikes on US base in Qatar, prompting air space closure, to minimize casualties.The United Arab Emirates too has joined Qatar in closing its airspace. Bahrain, a Gulf State very close to Qatar, has also suspended air traffic. And so has Kuwait. \"The Civil Aviation Affairs of the Ministry of Transportation and Telecommunications announced the temporary suspension of air navigation in the skies of the Kingdom of Bahrain as a precautionary measure in light of recent regional developments,\" said a statement carried by the official Bahrain news agency.The Indian Embassy in Doha has issued an advisory for its citizens in Qatar and said, \"In view of the ongoing situation, Indian community in Qatar is urged to be cautious and remains indoors. Please remain calm and follow local news, instructions and guidance provides by Qatari authorities. The Embassy will also keep updating through our social media channels.\"Iran had issued threats to retaliate against the United States after Washington dropped 30,000-pound bunker-busters on the country's underground nuclear installations over the weekend, while Trump openly raised the possibility of the Iranian government being toppled.Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow as Tehran sought backing from one of its last major power friends for its next steps.Earlier on Monday, Israel struck a jail for political prisoners in Tehran in a potent demonstration that it was expanding its targets beyond military and nuclear sites to aim squarely at the pillars of Iran's ruling system.A few hours ago, the US embassy in Qatar told US citizens they should shelter in place \"until further notice\". The short statement did not go into any specific detail, but said the alert had been issued \"out of an abundance of caution\".",
