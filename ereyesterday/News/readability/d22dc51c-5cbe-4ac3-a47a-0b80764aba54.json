  "text": "President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to clamp down on migrant crossings at the southern border by quickly restoring the policies of his first term, including “Remain in Mexico,” which required asylum seekers to wait outside U.S. territory while their cases were decided.But when he returns to office in January, Trump stands to inherit enforcement tools from the Biden administration that are even more powerful than the policies at his disposal last time.Biden administration officials, for example, have implemented emergency border controls this year that essentially ban asylum for migrants who enter unlawfully. While Trump’s Remain in Mexico policy provided asylum seekers with access to U.S. courts, President Joe Biden’s asylum restrictions afford no such process, allowing U.S. officials to summarily deport migrants and threaten them with criminal prosecution if they return.Biden’s policies are deplored by immigration advocates, but they were designed to mitigate one of the Democrats’ biggest vulnerabilities heading into the election — record-high illegal crossings during the president’s first three years in office.The asylum restrictions have helped the administration slash the number of illegal crossings at the Mexico border by 78 percent since December to levels even lower than during the end of Trump’s first term.Biden officials defend their restrictions as part of a broader carrot-and-stick approach meant to channel migrants away from smugglers and toward Biden’s expanded “lawful pathways,” which allow more than 70,000 applicants per month to enter the United States legally.Trump is planning to take away the carrots and keep the sticks.Trump said he will appoint former Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Tom Homan to be a White House senior official with authority over the country’s land and maritime borders. Homan “will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social site late Sunday.Homan, a former Border Patrol agent who became an ICE official, led the agency during the first 18 months of Trump’s term, but left the administration when the White House didn’t advance his Senate confirmation. With a gruff manner and glowering demeanor on television, he became a fixture on Fox News segments hammering Biden’s border record.During an appearance on the network Sunday before the announcement of his new role, Homan called Remain in Mexico “an outstanding idea” and a “game changer” that saved lives by discouraging illegal crossings.“People are going to still claim asylum, but they’re going to wait in Mexico,” Homan said. “Once the word got out that they weren’t going to be released, they stopped coming.”Illegal crossings during the first Trump administration peaked in May 2019 and began falling as border officials aggressively expanded Remain in Mexico (officially the Migrant Protection Protocols). Thousands of asylum seekers were sent back across the border, settling into squalid camps on the banks of the Rio Grande.The concept of a White House “border czar” circulated during Trump’s term as well as Biden’s presidency. It creates some redundancy with the homeland security secretary, who oversees U.S. borders and immigration enforcement agencies. But the role potentially allows a single White House official to coordinate operations among the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Justice and other federal agencies.Trump said on the campaign trail that he might deploy National Guard troops to assist with his mass deportation plans. Homan told The Washington Post in an interview Monday that military forces would probably be involved only in a supporting role, such as providing transportation, but not make arrests.“I’m not saying arrest a million people in a week, right?” Homan said. “We’ve got to go for the worst first. And that’s what we’re going to do.”Trump is also expected to order border wall construction to resume, among other changes of Biden measures that reversed Trump’s first-term policies.Longtime Trump aide Stephen Miller, the president-elect’s speechwriter and immigration policy adviser, is expected to return to the White House in a deputy chief of staff role. He did not respond to a request for comment on Biden’s asylum restrictions and plans for a resumption of Remain in Mexico.Some veteran U.S. border officials say Remain in Mexico was cumbersome and inefficient, requiring additional layers of paperwork and complex logistics as officials had to bring migrants back across the border to attend court hearings.But the policy was widely credited by conservatives as the tool that allowed Trump to corral his own border crisis in spring 2019, when record numbers of Central American families streamed into the United States, overwhelming border facilities and prompting officials to declare a “breaking point.”In March 2020, the coronavirus pandemic prompted Trump officials to declare a public health emergency and suspend standard immigration procedures. Remain in Mexico was essentially replaced by a policy issued under Title 42, a legal tool that allowed U.S. border officials to expel asylum seekers to Mexico or their home countries without providing due process.Biden initially kept the policy in place but granted far more exceptions, swelling the asylum backlog in U.S. courts. The Biden administration faced legal challenges to the Title 42 border policy and finally lifted the policy in May 2023. During that time Biden officials deepened cooperation with the Mexican government on immigration enforcement, reaching a deal that for the first time has allowed the United States to carry out large-scale deportations of non-Mexican migrants across the border.Mexico conditioned its cooperation on Biden’s willingness to let more migrants apply to live and work legally in the United States. It’s unclear if Mexican authorities will continue to take back non-Mexican deportees if Trump shuts off “lawful pathways.”Andrea Flores, the former White House official tasked with rebuilding asylum processing along the U.S. border after Biden took office, said the Trump administration will inherit a protection system that has been “dismantled.”“The Biden policies are not crafted to identify asylum seekers,” she said. “They are crafted to decompress pressure at the border.”Biden’s expansion of “lawful pathways” was not a replacement for humanitarian protections, Flores said. “It was a strategy to redirect movement at the border toward safer channels.”“The Trump administration is going to learn firsthand how much impact the legal pathways have had in maintaining lower numbers at the border,” said Flores, now a policy director at the advocacy group FWD.us.The number of illegal crossings along the Mexico border soared to 2 million per year between 2021 and 2023, an all-time high, as migrants from South America, Asia and nations around the world arrived in historic numbers. Many claimed to be fleeing persecution, the first step in seeking asylum in the United States, and millions were released into the country with pending cases.The incoming Trump team should carefully consider which Biden policies to leave in place, especially the asylum restrictions, said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which seeks to reduce all forms of immigration.“That’s not to say Remain in Mexico shouldn’t be in the tool kit, but Remain in Mexico presumes illegal border crossers still should apply for asylum — and they shouldn’t,” Krikorian said.Remain in Mexico was a valuable “short-term response” to the spike in crossings that occurred in 2019 but the Trump team needs to identify more durable measures to prevent asylum seekers from getting U.S. court hearings, Krikorian said. That could include a revival of the Asylum Cooperative Agreements that the Trump administration worked out with Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, allowing U.S. authorities to send migrants seeking safe refuge back to Central America.Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an attorney and analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, said the incoming Trump administration will probably face a resource crunch if it once more attempts a nationwide expansion of the government’s fast-track deportation authority, known as expedited removal.There simply aren’t enough immigration judges, asylum officers and deportation flights available, she said. “You can’t do it all at once,” said Bush-Joseph. The border restrictions Trump could inherit from Biden are also on uncertain legal footing, she said.Biden’s asylum rules are facing lawsuits from immigrant advocates in U.S. District Court in California and Washington, D.C. A ruling on the Biden restrictions could come before Trump’s inauguration, or soon after, Bush-Joseph said.Trump attempted similar restrictions on asylum during his first term for migrants who cross illegally or do not seek protection in other countries they travel through en route to the U.S. border. Those measures were blocked in federal court.Maria Sacchetti contributed to this report.",
