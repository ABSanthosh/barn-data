  "text": "Israel has signed domestic deals worth around $275 million to produce its own heavy bombs and raw materials for defense in a bid to reduce its reliance on imports in what the Defense Ministry described Tuesday as a “key lesson” from the war in Gaza.Under the first deal, Elbit, the country’s largest private weapons manufacturer, will supply the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with thousands of heavy air munitions, the ministry announced. The second involves the construction of a raw materials plant, it said, without giving further details.Western governments have at times threatened to hold up weapons supplies to Israel in the course of its destructive war on Gaza. The Biden administration paused shipments of some heavy air munitions last year out of concern they would be used in densely populated areas of Gaza.Israel’s sustained use of heavy munitions in the densely populated Gaza Strip has led to conflict monitor Airwars describing it as the most destructive conflict of the 21st century.“Both agreements will ensure sovereign capability in producing bombs and munitions of all types,” Eyal Zamir, director general of the Defense Ministry, was quoted by the ministry as saying at the signing ceremony.At least 45,885 people have been killed in Gaza and 109,196 injured since the October 2023 Hamas attack, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. An additional 4,000 people were killed during Israel’s war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, where a shaky ceasefire is currently in effect.Zamir said the move toward domestically producing heavy munitions began before the war in Gaza but that the plans have since been accelerated.Here’s what else to knowSteve Witkoff, Trump’s incoming Middle East envoy, said Tuesday that “good progress” has been made toward the release Israeli hostages. Witkoff said that he is working with the Biden administration and that they are “on the verge” of a deal. Witkoff said he is likely to return to the region today or tomorrow.The Israel Defense Forces said it is investigating an incident in which its troops were caught on camera using an ambulance as cover for transportation during an operation in the West Bank last month. The IDF has faced international condemnation for targeting ambulances in Gaza and Lebanon that it says were transporting fighters. It has maintained that those attacks do not violate international law because the ambulances are “exploited … for terrorist purposes.”Three Israelis in the West Bank were killed and eight others were wounded on Monday as gunmen opened fire on a bus and surrounding vehicles, the Israeli military and emergency services said. A manhunt for the perpetrators continues. Revenge settler attacks swept through Palestinian villages after the shooting, and the IDF launched a wave of raids that killed at least three Palestinians.Iran began military drills near its Natanz nuclear facility on Tuesday, one of a series of large-scale maneuvers that are planned across the country. Iran’s Revolutionary Guard will carry out almost double the usual number of winter exercises this year, after it was dealt a series of setbacks by Israel and just ahead of the inauguration of the new U.S. president.The first international flight since rebels toppled Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria landed in the capital Damascus from Qatar on Tuesday. It marked the first Qatari flight to land in Syria for 13 years. Syria’s state news agency SANA said “the first Syrian plane after liberation” took off on Tuesday heading to Sharjah, carrying 145 Syrian passengers.Live coverage contributors 6Fate of U.N. Palestinian refugee agency in limbo as Israel readies ban Return to menuWp logoQALANDIA CAMP, West Bank — The U.N. agency that provides aid and services to millions of Palestinians across the Middle East may soon be forced to end its operations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as Israel prepares to enact twin laws banning the organization’s work in Israeli territory and prohibiting contact between its staff and government officials.The legislation, passed with near-unanimity by Israel’s Knesset in October, is set to go into effect later this month. It could compel the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) to dismantle what is essentially a quasi-state in the Palestinian territories, built over generations to serve a growing population of refugees and their descendants.Israel has already taken significant steps to handicap UNRWA’s operations in Gaza, where it alleged last year that 19 of the agency’s 13,000 workers participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. An internal U.N. investigation found in August that nine of the accused “may have been involved” and that Israel provided insufficient or no evidence for the other cases.Still, Israel has restricted aid deliveries and damaged or destroyed hundreds of the agency’s buildings in strikes the military says targeted Hamas. Now, there are fears that the agency could be crippled by a similar crackdown in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where together it provides employment, education, health care and sanitation services to more than 900,000 registered refugees.Entire communities have relied on UNRWA for generations, and Palestinian officials say that even if they could fill the gaps left by the agency, doing so could strip the refugees of their legal status, which includes the right to return to their homes in what is now Israel.This is an excerpt from a full story.U.S. redirects $95 million in military aid from Egypt to LebanonReturn to menuThe Biden administration has decided to redirect $95 million in military aid from Egypt to Lebanon after Senate Democrats raised concerns that Cairo had failed to meet human rights conditions attached to the assistance, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.The funds will instead go to the Lebanese Armed Forces, the official said. The LAF is trying to enforce a ceasefire deal with Israel after an escalation in hostilities between the Israeli military and the Lebanese paramilitary group Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, in the fall.The decision to redirect the aid, first reported by Reuters, has not been announced publicly.The State Department informed Congress in September that it would provide Egypt with the entire $1.3 billion package usually allotted to the country annually — a significant policy change for the Biden administration, which had previously withheld a portion of the money to protest Egypt’s ongoing imprisonment of human rights defenders and crackdowns on critical speech. The reversal came as Egypt played a critical role in mediating talks between Israel and Hamas over a possible Gaza ceasefire deal and in serving as a conduit for humanitarian aid destined for the besieged Palestinian enclave.But Democrats in the Senate argued that Egypt had failed to make progress on human rights, continuing to jail political prisoners, including two U.S. legal permanent residents. They placed a hold on the aid, meaning it was never disbursed, according to the administration official.Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Connecticut), one of the lawmakers who pressed the Biden administration to withhold the funds from Egypt, praised the decision in a post on X on Tuesday.“Lebanon is far more deserving and in need of this aid,” he wrote. “Faced with unprecedented pressures, Lebanon continues to hold together a factious but multi-religious, multi-ethnic society. And they don’t lock up political activists like they do in Egypt!”The Egyptian Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Syrian foreign minister vows an end to illegal Captagon productionReturn to menuBEIRUT — Syria’s new interim foreign minister vowed in a new conference Tuesday to end the production and smuggling of counterfeit Captagon, a drug that underpinned the regime of ousted Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, flooding the region in recent years.“The new situation in Syria ended the threats posed to Jordan’s security,” Asaad al-Shibani said, speaking alongside Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi at a news conference in Amman, the last stop in a regional diplomatic tour, Reuters reported. “When it comes to Captagon and drug smuggling, we promise it is over and won’t return. We are ready to cooperate on this extensively.”Jordan, which had become a key transit route for smugglers to get the widely illegal synthetic stimulant to wealthier Arab states of the Persian Gulf, has taken a stronger stance in its efforts to stop it from crossing its borders by carrying out preemptive strikes in Syria.“We discussed securing the borders, especially the threat of arms and drugs smuggling and the resurgence of Islamic State. Our security is one. We will coordinate together to combat these mutual challenges,” his Jordanian counterpart Safadi said in the joint news conference.With the Islamist rebel group turned government vying for international legitimacy and support in rebuilding a war-shattered Syria, Shabani has been on a regional diplomatic tour this week to cultivate ties with Arab partners.As on other stops in his tour, Shabani asked for Jordan’s help in lifting international sanctions that were imposed on the Assad government.He described a decision Monday by the U.S. Treasury Department to ease restrictions on humanitarian aid as a “breakthrough” that he hoped would pave the way for the lifting of sanctions.Gaza aid facing ‘dangerous pattern of sabotage,’ U.N. official saysReturn to menuAid efforts in Gaza are facing a “dangerous pattern of sabotage and deliberate disruption,” U.N. humanitarian affairs chief Tom Fletcher said Monday, citing recent Israeli attacks on and around marked U.N. convoys and a Palestinian gang hijacking fuel tankers entering the Gaza Strip.“The reality is that despite our determination to deliver food, water, and medicine to survivors, our efforts to save lives are at breaking point,” Fletcher said in a statement. “Israeli forces are unable or unwilling to ensure the safety of our convoys. Statements by Israeli authorities vilify our aid workers even as the military attacks them. Community volunteers who accompany our convoys are being targeted,” he added.On Monday, the U.N. World Food Program condemned Israeli forces for firing at least 16 bullets at one of its convoys in Gaza over the weekend, with a photo posted by the organization’s director showing bullet holes in the window and body of a vehicle marked with a WFP logo and U.N. branding. Eight people were inside the convoy at the time, WFP chief Cindy McCain said.“This unacceptable event is just the latest example of the complex and dangerous working environment that WFP and other agencies are operating in today,” WFP said in a statement. “Security conditions in Gaza must urgently improve for lifesaving humanitarian assistance to continue.”When asked about the incident, the IDF said it “is doing everything possible to mitigate harm to uninvolved civilians, and through COGAT, will continue to enable and facilitate the transfer of humanitarian aid to the residents of the Gaza Strip.”In November, the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) declared 2024 the deadliest year on record for humanitarian workers. The war in Gaza drove the surge in the death toll, with at least 420 humanitarian workers killed in the first year of the conflict, according to several U.N. agencies.Middle East conflict The Israel-Gaza war has gone on for over a year, and tensions have spilled into the surrounding Middle East region.The war: On Oct. 7, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. We’re tracking how many hostages remain in Gaza. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel’s creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.Cease-fire: Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah agreed to a cease-fire deal in November 2024, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities. Here’s what to know about the deal’s terms and how it will be enforced.Hezbollah: Hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, a militant organization backed by Iran, have escalated over the past year, leading to an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon. Israel’s airstrikes into Lebanon have grown more intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel’s founding.Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century’s most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including President Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations’ cease-fire resolutions.Monitoring the status of hostages still in Gaza after Hamas’s attackAssad defends escape from Syria, blames ‘terrorist onslaught’ in first statementWar’s ebb in Lebanon leaves devastation and uncertain future",
