Rosenfeld/Getty ImagesFeb. 10, 2025Updated 7:09 p.m. ETHamas has indefinitely postponed the release of Israeli hostages who were set to be freed from the Gaza Strip this weekend, a spokesman said on Monday, accusing Israel’s government of violating an already fragile cease-fire agreement.The move threatens to derail both the six-week truce agreed to last month and the prospects for agreement on a lasting end to the war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was consulting with his top advisers on Monday night, and planned to move up a scheduled meeting with his security cabinet to Tuesday morning, a top official said.Hours later, President Trump issued an ultimatum to Hamas on Monday evening, saying that if all Israeli hostages were not released from Gaza by 12 o’clock on Saturday, then the cease-fire agreement with Israel should be canceled and “all hell is going to break out.”“Israel can override it, but from myself, Saturday at 12 o’clock, and if they’re not, they’re not here, all hell is going to break out,” Mr. Trump said while signing executive orders at the White House in front of reporters.Asked whether he meant retaliation from Israel, the president said: “You’ll find out, and they’ll find out to. Hamas will find out what I mean.” Asked whether he would rule out any U.S. involvement after the Saturday deadline, Mr. Trump said, “We’ll see what happens.”Both Hamas and Israel have accused each other of violating various aspects of the cease-fire agreement, but they have continued to release Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners each week.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
