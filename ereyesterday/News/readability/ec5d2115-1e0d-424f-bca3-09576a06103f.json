  "text": "Cuts to foreign aid and humanitarian assistance by donors across the board, but especially by the United States, have been “a seismic shock,” the United Nations’ chief humanitarian official said Wednesday. “Many will die because that aid is drying up.”As the United Nations and other aid agencies try to regroup and find new efficiencies, the goal is to help at least 100 million priority cases out of an estimate of about 300 million people in desperate need of humanitarian aid this year, said Tom Fletcher, the U.N. undersecretary of humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator.“We will have to save as many people as we can with the money we have. Not the money that we had, nor the money that we would like,” Fletcher told reporters at a briefing at U.N. headquarters in New York. “We’ll have to build fresh arguments ... find new sources of funding. We’ll have to fight back. We’ll have to reimagine what we do.”His remarks came as the Trump administration has dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, stopping tens of billions of dollars Washington distributes each year to humanitarian aid. In a social media post earlier this week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that 83 percent of all USAID programs have been canceled and that the remainder will be folded into the State Department.At the same time, much of the U.S. funding for humanitarian, development, democracy and law enforcement initiatives through the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security and other U.S. agencies — as well as directly from the State Department — around the world has been frozen. While totaling less than 1 percent of the federal budget, U.S. assistance funds anywhere from one-quarter to one-half of all global aid expenditures, depending on the location and program.Rubio, who was one of the strongest supporters of foreign aid as a senator, has instituted a 90-day review of all assistance programs to determine which should be permanently discontinued. But the abrupt pause in distribution of funds — set in motion by the U.S. DOGE Service, led by Elon Musk — has already resulted in the shutdown of many programs that humanitarian organizations say will be difficult, if not impossible, to restart in the short or medium term.Although some programs have been granted waivers for what Rubio has called “life-saving” activities, many humanitarian organizations say that the process is confusing and that they still cannot access money that they have been told has been cleared for expenditure.Aid levels have been falling throughout the world for years, with the United Nations and other groups rarely able to reach their annual funding or emergency appeal targets. An emergency U.N. campaign for Sudan, where an estimated 30 million people are in extreme need of basic assistance for food, medical care and shelter, has reached between 5 and 10 percent of its funding target so far, Fletcher said. About 10 percent of all nongovernmental organization, or NGO, workers for humanitarian agencies have already been laid off during February, he said.He also called on Israel to restart the distribution of aid in Gaza, where borders were closed two weeks ago as the fragile ceasefire verged on unraveling. During a January tour there before the latest cutoff, Fletcher said, “it was much, much worse than I’d anticipated, and I’d really prepared myself for the worst,” he said. He described complete destruction and “miles and miles of rubble” in northern Gaza without a single building left standing and feral dogs roaming piles of rubble in search of corpses to eat.In addition to overseeing U.N. humanitarian programs, Fletcher leads the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, a coordination forum for organizations within and outside of the U.N. system to set strategic priorities and mobilize resources in response to humanitarian crises.In a “humanitarian reset” document distributed Tuesday, he set out 10 actions to deal with the funding crisis, including tasking senior representatives to report by the end of this week on how they can “prioritize urgent life-saving actions.” He also stressed the need to find new funding sources, including from wealthy Persian Gulf countries and renewed grassroots appeals for private donations.At the same time, Fletcher wrote, the aid community is not without responsibility for its problems. “Much of the change we need is about the way we work,” he wrote, saying there was already agreement “to be ruthless in eliminating turf wars and challenging our organizations to work genuinely together ... to give up power and to act collectively where possible to share information and data.”Acknowledging overlap and wasteful practices, he proposed increased pooling of resources to “collectively finance common services” such as humanitarian air bridges, data collection and analysis, and rapid-response mechanisms.“We have been reliant in recent years, over-reliant, on U.S. funding,” Fletcher said. “Almost half of our appeals have been funded by the American taxpayer. It’s important to recognize that we shouldn’t ever take that for granted, particularly in a period of economic difficulty and in a period when many governments are in retreat from the world.”",
