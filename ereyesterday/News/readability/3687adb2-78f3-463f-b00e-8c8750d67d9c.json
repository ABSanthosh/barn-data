Therefore, I have instructed the termination of all remaining 'Biden Era' US Attorneys. We must 'clean house' immediately and restore confidence,\" Trump said.\"We must 'clean house' immediately and restore confidence.

Meanwhile, several US attorneys, appointed by Biden also announced to step down after a change in the presidential administration.While it is customary for US Attorneys to step down after presidents change, usually the incoming administration asks for their resignations and does not issue tersely worded termination letters, current and former Justice Department lawyers say.While career Justice Department officials typically remain in their roles across administrations, dozens in cities like Washington and New York have either resigned or been fired since Trump's inauguration.Trump campaigned on a promise to end what he calls the Justice Department's \"weaponization,\" claiming it was used against him during his years out of power.",
