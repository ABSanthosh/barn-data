But the Israel Defense Forces have intensified strikes on Hezbollah’s infrastructure in Lebanon and targeted its leaders for assassination since the group began firing on Israel in solidarity with Hamas, which led the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel from Gaza.The strikes in Lebanon occurred the same day that Israeli fighter jets bombed sites in the Syrian capital, Damascus, that the military said were affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militia backed by Iran. The attacks killed at least 15 people and wounded 16 others, including women and children, according to Syrian state media.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
