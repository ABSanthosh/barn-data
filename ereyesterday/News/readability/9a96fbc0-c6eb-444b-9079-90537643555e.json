When we have confirmed access, the full article content will load.A copy of the agreement obtained by The New York Times says that the United States “supports Ukraine’s effort to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.”Extracting ilmenite, a titanium ore, in an open-pit mine in the central region of Kirovohrad, Ukraine, this month.Credit...Efrem Lukatsky/Associated PressFeb. 26, 2025Updated 5:40 p.m. ETA draft of an agreement calling for Ukraine to hand over to the United States revenue from natural resources includes new language referring to security guarantees, a provision Kyiv had pressed for vigorously in negotiations.The reference is vague and does not signal any specific American commitment to safeguarding Ukraine’s security.A copy of the agreement obtained Wednesday by The New York Times included a sentence stating that the United States “supports Ukraine’s effort to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.” Previous drafts did not have the phrase on security guarantees.But, at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, President Trump put Ukraine on notice that, “I’m not going to provide security guarantees beyond very much.” He added, at the meeting in Washington, “We’re going to have Europe do that.”It was not clear whether the draft, dated Tuesday, was a final version.A Ukrainian official briefed on the draft, and several people in Ukraine with knowledge of the talks, confirmed that wording on security had been included in the document. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations.The agreement is seen as opening the door to possible continued backing from the United States under the Trump administration, either as aid for the war effort or as enforcement of any cease-fire. Officials in the United States and Ukraine said on Tuesday that a version had been accepted by both sides.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
