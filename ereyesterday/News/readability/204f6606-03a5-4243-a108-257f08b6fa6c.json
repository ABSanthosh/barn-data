  "text": "TEL AVIV — An Israeli ultra-Orthodox Jewish party announced Wednesday evening that it will resign from the government, stripping Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of his parliamentary majority as Israel wages its longest war in decades.The Shas party, led by Netanyahu ally Aryeh Deri, said in a statement that it demanded that Netanyahu enshrine into law the long-standing military exemption for the ultra-Orthodox community — which currently constitutes about 14 percent of the population, but is growing rapidly — no later than the start of the Knesset’s winter session in October. Shas also said it also wanted to see a deal to bring home Israel’s remaining 50 hostages held in Gaza.Shas said Netanyahu had failed to uphold commitments but that the party would, at least in the immediate term, continue to support his government and would not join up with Israeli opposition parties to bring it down.“We were privileged to witness God’s grace and open miracles during the war, especially in the confrontation with Iran,” said the statement.Shas said its decision was made in light of the “persecution” of students of ultra-Orthodox religious seminaries, tens of thousands of whom have received official enlistment orders in recent months. According to Israeli law, young men who do not answer their summons can face imprisonment, fines or other punitive measures.The party’s departure, which is expected to be formalized with resignation letters on Thursday and go into effect on Sunday, reduces Netanyahu’s far-right coalition to 50 out of 120 parliamentary seats. Another ultra-Orthodox coalition partner, United Torah Judaism, quit on Monday, citing the same demands.Opposition leader Yair Lapid said such a minority government, lacking a parliamentary majority that would enable it to pass legislation, was “illegitimate” and required a new round of elections.“A minority government can’t send soldiers to battle. It can’t decide who lives and dies. It can’t decide on what will be in Gaza or secure agreements with Syria or Saudi Arabia,” Lapid said. “It can’t continue transferring billions to corruption and draft evasion at taxpayers’ expense. A minority government certainly can’t exempt the ultra-Orthodox from the draft.”It is unclear if Netanyahu would be able to win the next election, which would be the first since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that triggered the war in the Gaza Strip, sinking the Israeli leader’s popularity.“This is the beginning of the end, where Netanyahu’s government will now have a long period of dying out,” said Gayil Talshir, a political scientist from Hebrew University. “Eighty percent of Netanyahu’s own voters are against the issue of ultra-Orthodox dodging the draft, and there is no way he will now go forward with this issue, especially with elections expected in 2026.”In the meantime, a record number of reservists have been called up to fight on Israel’s multiple front lines, and in recent weeks, the Israeli military death toll has reached 893. Bitter resentment is bubbling up across much of Israeli society at the ultra-Orthodox parties. About 85 percent of Israelis are in favor of ultra-Orthodox enlistment, according to a poll released last year by the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan research institute in Jerusalem.“The public will not forgive those who fail to rise to the moment and unite around one shared goal: the security and future of the state of Israel,” Yuli Edelstein, a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party, said Tuesday, addressing the ultra-Orthodox parties.Reservists across the country say that as they prepare to serve, again, their anger is growing over the ultra-Orthodox issue. Ari Krauss, a reservist in an elite infantry brigade, said that he got a call-up summons on Tuesday, just as Netanyahu was engaging in marathon negotiations with the ultra-Orthodox parties.“You can’t escape this sense of duality, that most Israelis are showing up, while this large group of ultra-Orthodox military-aged men are not only refusing to serve, but they are the ones authorizing our summons,” said Krauss. “It’s a betrayal.”",
