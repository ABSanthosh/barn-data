  "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a bilateral meeting at the Grand Kremlin Palace, March 13, 2025, in Moscow, Russia. Contributor | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday hailed the \"very good chance\" of Russia and Ukraine striking a 30-day Washington-led ceasefire, after the Kremlin endorsed the \"idea\" of the truce with caveats.\"We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end,\" Trump said on his Truth Social media platform, in a likely reference to the Moscow meeting of his envoy, Steve Witkoff, with Kremlin leader Putin.The engagement came after the Russian president on Thursday appeared to warm to a U.S.-negotiated ceasefire proposal that Ukraine has already backed.\"The idea [of a ceasefire] itself is correct and we are certainly supporting it, but there are issues that need to be discussed,\" Putin said Thursday, urging further discussions with Washington and a potential call with White House leader Trump.Putin has expressed concerns that a temporary truce would bide Kyiv's forces the time to \"supply weapons\" or \"train newly mobilized units\" and questioned how the ceasefire would be enforced.Trump, who has defrosted Washington's relationship with Moscow since the January start of his second term in office, on Thursday said that Kyiv and the White House had discussed elements of an agreement including territorial concessions, the fate of an unnamed power plant — likely the Russia-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility — and Ukraine's future accession to NATO.\"Now we're going to see whether or not Russia is there, and if they're not, it'll be a very disappointing moment for the world,\" Trump said. \"[Putin] put out a very promising statement, but it was incomplete. And yeah, I'd love to meet with him, or talk to him.\"\"We do have some cautious optimism,\" U.S. national security advisor Mike Waltz said in a Fox News TV interview. \"Of course both sides are going to have their demands, and of course both sides are going to have to make some compromises, and the shuttle diplomacy of going back and forth is happening.\"The Kremlin retained a cautious tone on Friday despite the Thursday developments.\"There are certainly reasons to be cautiously optimistic,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, in Google-translated comments carried by Russian state outlet Tass.\"[Putin] said that he supports President Trump's position in terms of a settlement, but he voiced some questions that need to be answered together,\" he added, according to Reuters. \"So, yes, indeed, there is still a lot to be done, but nevertheless, the president expressed solidarity with Mr. Trump's position.\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meanwhile criticized the Russian response on Friday:\"Now the world sees how Russia is deliberately putting forward conditions that only complicate and delay everything, because Russia is the only entity that wants the war not to end and diplomacy to break down,\" he said in a Google-translated Telegram post.'Holding the ceasefire proposal hostage'The U.S.-brokered and Ukraine-endorsed ceasefire draft marks a breakthrough in the three-year conflict of attrition, which continued with overnight drone attacks reported on both sides by Ukrainian and Russian officials. The proposal also resets relations in the U.S.-Russia-Ukraine triangle, after a heated late February White House clash between Trump and Zelenskyy and the temporary interruption of U.S. military aid to Kyiv seemed poised to thrust Washington deeper into the Kremlin's orbit.It is now Putin who must tread lightly with Trump, who has made ending the Russia-Ukraine war — and reviewing the U.S.' financial contributions toward it — a priority since taking office.Yet some analysts question the fate of the ceasefire agreement, which follows previous unsuccessful peace plans from Zelenskyy and China.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump rejects pleas from business for more clarity on tariffs: 'They always say that'Unions ask court to stop DOGE from accessing Social Security data of millionsTrump downplays concerns about his tariffs and the prospect of higher pricesTrump Organization sues Capital One bank over account closures after Jan. 6 Capitol riotTrump puts new limits on Elon Musk's authority amid backlash to DOGE cuts\"Putin is holding the ceasefire proposal hostage and is attempting to extract preemptive concessions ahead of formal negotiations to end the war,\" the Institute for the Study of War said in analysis, warning the Kremlin leader is likely \"disinterested in good faith peace negotiations\" and still seeks to deliver on long-term objectives of Ukrainian demilitarization.\"Putin's envisioned ceasefire would grant Russia greatly disproportionate advantages and set conditions for the Kremlin to renew hostilities on terms extremely favorable to Russia,\" it added.Moscow's steep terms to begin peace negotiations, laid out in June last year, included Ukraine's complete military withdrawal from the Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, as well as Kyiv's abandonment of plans to join the NATO military alliance and imperil Russian security — a key point among the Kremlin's stated reasons for its full-fledged invasion of its neighbor in 2022.",
