Axios reported that President-elect Donald Trump was finalizing Kash Patel's name for a high-profile position at either the FBI or the Justice Department, though he is fully aware of the backlash that this pick would attract. Given the hurdles Patel might face winning Senate confirmation, Trump is considering naming him deputy director or to an appointed investigative role within the DOJ, Axios reported citing sources.Indian-American Kash Patel briefly served in the Justice Department during the Obama administration After Trump took office, he spent two years as senior counsel to former Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., when he led the House Intelligence Committee in 2017 and 2018, helping with the committee’s widely criticized inquiry into the FBI’s Russia investigation. In 2018, he served as Trump's senior director for counterterrorism on the National Security Council to senior adviser for Trump’s directors of national intelligence, and then finally being promoted to chief of staff to acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller during Trump’s final months in office.Patel has openly discussed retaliation against Trump's political enemies in government and media, and wrote in his book: \"[T]he FBI has become so thoroughly compromised that it will remain a threat to the people unless drastic measures are taken.\"Trump tried to install Patel to serve as deputy director of the CIA or FBI in the final months of his presidency, according to multiple reports, but backed down after then-CIA Director Gina Haspel and then-Attorney General William Barr threatened to resign over the move.\"Kash has a lot of allies who think placing him in a top role would be well-received by the Trump base, and send a clear message that Trump is serious about major reform to the justice and law-enforcement agencies,\" a transition source told Axios.\"President-elect Trump has made brilliant decisions on who will serve in his second administration at lightning pace. Remaining decisions will continue to be announced by him when they are made,\" Trump transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Axios.Trump has signaled he will fire current FBI director Christopher Wray, whom he nominated in 2017 to serve a 10-year term after ousting James Comey.Axios reported that the final decision on Kash Patel has not been made and Trump could still change his mind and make Patel all the way to FBI director which may send shockwaves similar to the nomination of Matt Gaetz as the attorney general which eventually Gatez had to withdraw.",
