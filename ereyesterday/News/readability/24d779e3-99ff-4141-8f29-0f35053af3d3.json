  "text": "DAMASCUS, Syria — President Donald Trump’s announcement from Saudi Arabia that his administration intends to lift wide-ranging sanctions on Syria sparked jubilation in the capital, Damascus, as a population long impoverished by the restrictions was finally able to hope for relief.For years, the U.S. government insisted that its sanctions targeted the regime of then-President Bashar al-Assad, a dictator who presided over a devastating civil war. But ultimately the measures, which cut off Syria from the global financial system, strangled the country’s economy, triggered hyperinflation, weakened the health system and left the poorest living hand-to-mouth.Within an hour of Trump’s surprise announcement in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the exchange rate of the Syrian pound against the dollar had tumbled. “It was 10,000, now it’s 9,000,” a street seller in the capital’s Bab Touma district called out at passing cars; many honked back in delight. By midnight, it was even lower. There were fireworks over Damascus, and people danced in the street.Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf nations has delivered a significant boost to Syria’s new leader, interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa. He came to power in December after his rebel forces seized the capital and Assad’s dictatorship crumbled overnight. A former member of Syria’s al-Qaeda affiliate, Sharaa has promised to rule for all Syrians, but he struggled to rein in attacks on minorities and remains formally designated a terrorist by the United States.A meeting between Trump and Sharaa on Wednesday was historic by any measure, not just because of the Syrian leader’s background — it marked the first time a U.S. president had met with any of his Syrian counterparts in 25 years.The White House said Trump encouraged the Syrian leader to establish diplomatic ties with Israel, help the U.S. defeat the Islamic State group and expel “foreign terrorists” from the country.In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump also had asked Sharaa to sign onto the Abraham Accords with Israel — a move that would mean normalization between the two countries after several wars and decades of hostility. But in comments aboard Air Force One, Trump appeared to soften that request, suggesting that the U.S. was not demanding immediate compliance.“I think they have to get themselves straightened up,” he said of Sharaa’s new government. “He said yes, but they have a lot of work to do.”Syria’s foreign ministry did not mention Israel in its readout of the meeting, and it was unclear exactly what the two men had said. Israel has launched hundreds of airstrikes in Syria since Sharaa came to power, leaving him caught between the need to appease his angry citizens, and the U.S. and E.U. decision-makers who hold the key to unlocking sanctions.“There is significant ambiguity surrounding the call to join the Abraham Accords, with very few details available — particularly regarding what was offered to Sharaa in return,” said Rim Turkmani, director of the Syria Conflict Research Program at the London School of Economics.“Unlike the Arab states that previously signed the Accords, Syria is a front-line state with territory still occupied by Israel,” she said. “Any structured agreement between Syria and Israel would necessarily require a phased process and substantial groundwork. It cannot be fast-tracked in the way that other Abraham Accords agreements have been.”Once the afterglow of Trump’s announcement fades in Syria, Sharaa will face even deeper challenges at home. The new authorities have frequently blamed the sanctions — which include penalties on third countries for doing business in Syria — for their inability to pay civil service salaries, reconstruct sizable chunks of war-ravaged cities and rebuild a health-care system decimated by war.“Now, we are not going to have any excuse by the government that there are sanctions that prevent doing this or that,” said Jihad Yazigi, founder and editor of the Syria Report, an online bulletin covering Syrian economic affairs.Among many Syrians, anticipation of a better life was palpable. As Hazem al-Loda, 31, a taxi driver, watched Trump’s speech on his phone Tuesday night, he held up his forearm to show that the hairs were standing up. “I’m happy,” he said. “I’m so happy.” He said he worked long hours to put food on the table. Even a visit from a friend required refreshments that he had to drive extra miles to be able to afford, he said.“The U.S. said these sanctions targeted Assad but it was us, the people, who suffered the most,” Loda said. “The government didn’t suffer. The rich found ways around it. We saw their fancy cars driving the streets in front of us, while we couldn’t afford anything made after 2011.”In al-Radwa Cafe, a Damascene institution where the air was thick with shisha and cigarette smoke, patrons clapped and swayed to music, late into the night. Asked what the people needed now, one of the waiters, Ezzedine Saliha, 25, said simply: “the essentials of life.”“This will help to start the reconstruction process, will create jobs for young people and for everyone,” he said.Analysts described Trump’s announcement Tuesday as without recent precedent. “I cannot think of another American president who has fully lifted economic restrictions on a country as heavily sanctioned as Syria,” said Delaney Simon, senior analyst with International Crisis Group’s U.S. Program.But she, like other experts, cautioned that the path to full sanctions relief was littered with obstacles. “It will require a massive bureaucratic and possibly political lift in Washington,” Simon said. “President Trump has a tough road ahead to make good on this commitment, but he should persevere.”U.S. sanctions on Syria date to 1979, but the range of comprehensive restrictions that has come to impact Syrians’ everyday lives was first imposed in 2011, after which the U.S. and E.U. championed a sanctions regime that deepened Syria’s international isolation as Assad’s army fought a bitter civil war against an array of rebel forces. At least a half-million Syrians were killed in the conflict, while Syria also became a battleground for Russia, Iran, Turkey and the U.S.Assad’s regime collapsed in December, leading the Biden administration to announce a partial lifting of sanctions. The E.U. promised to remove some of its own restrictions altogether. But the impact of that relief remained largely symbolic, as widespread overcompliance meant international institutions and private companies continued to avoid Syria altogether.Most international trade was off the table; so was the reconstruction of scores of shattered neighborhoods, even as some inhabitants returned to eke out a living amid the ruins.“The importance of the decision now is the political message,” Yazigi said. “When Trump says, ‘Good luck, Syria, we are lifting the sanctions,’ you are saying that Syria is back.”El Chamaa reported from Beirut.",
