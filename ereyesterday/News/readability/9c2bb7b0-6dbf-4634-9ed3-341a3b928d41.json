  "text": "A gang of masked intruders, believed to be teenagers, has been linked to two daring home invasions in Queens, with one incident leaving a resident hospitalised.The group of nine broke into a home on 147th Place in Flushing around 1 am on Sunday by smashing a front window with a hammer. Once inside, they attacked a 37-year-old man, bludgeoning him with the hammer and stabbing him in the back, police said.The suspects stole jewellery and clothing before fleeing in a grey Toyota Sienna. The injured resident was taken to New York-Presbyterian Queens Hospital, where he is now in stable condition.CCTV footage shows the intruders, most wearing face masks and winter coats, gathered on the stoop of the home. One is seen holding a hammer, while another grips a knife as snow falls around them.Earlier, just hours into the New Year, the same group allegedly targeted another home on the same street. At around 3 a.m., they reportedly smashed a living room window and stole approximately $25,000 in cash and a bracelet. No injuries were reported in that incident, and they fled in a grey vehicle.The NYPD has released the footage and is urging the public to help identify the suspects.",
