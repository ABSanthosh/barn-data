  "text": "A former head teacher has been struck off over a ski trip where one girl said she slept with three boys and was paid for sex by one of them.Justine Drury was principal at the CP Riverside School in Nottingham, which caters for children with behavioural and social issues, when the excursion took place in 2017.The trip to Switzerland was attended by 10 boys and two girls alongside Mrs Drury, another staff member and an apprentice staff member.A Teaching Regulation Agency panel heard that one pupil, known only as Pupil A, said she had had sex with three of the boys, including one in exchange for £30.One pupil filmed two others having sex and used the footage in an attempt to blackmail Pupil A into having sex with him, the panel heard.Mrs Drury said she “found out later” that sexual activity had been filmed and that she was “picking up a vibe that Pupil I had recorded some footage”.On the third day, almost all the pupils broke down the door of the restaurant in the hotel and stole around 10 bottles of spirits, it was said.On another occasion, one pupil was found with a knife, some shoplifted and some of the children attended nightclubs unsupervised, the panel was told.Mrs Drury did not have written consent from the parents of all pupils to go on the trip - INSTAGRAMThe TRA found the pupil-teacher ratio was “entirely inappropriate”.Mrs Drury also did not have written consent from the parents of all pupils for them to attend and risk assessments were not completed sufficiently.It was known that 10 of the pupils had special educational needs, eight were known to be sexually active, seven were known to have substance misuse problems and three were involved with the justice system at the time.Mrs Drury had initially taken sufficient steps to try to prevent initial sexual activity, the panel found.She had then allowed pupils to be left unsupervised for long periods and not taken action after she knew that pupils were engaging in sexual activity.The lack of supervision also led to the stealing, it was said.After the trip had ended, Mrs Drury did not tell the school’s trustees and the local authority about what had happened.The TRA cited evidence from witnesses who said she showed “no understanding of why her actions were not appropriate and seemingly had no regard for anyone other than herself.”Mrs Drury was the head teacher at CP Riverside School in NottinghamMrs Drury, who did not attend her hearing, was banned from teaching in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children’s home in England indefinitely. She is able to appeal the ruling after five years.The panel said it saw “no evidence as to Mrs Drury’s ability as an educator”.It added: “Therefore, the panel considered that the adverse public interest considerations above outweigh any interest in retaining Mrs Drury in the profession, since her behaviour fundamentally breached the standard of conduct expected of a teacher, particularly in her role as head teacher.”CP Riverside School and the East Midlands Education Trust said in a joint statement: “When the allegations emerged following the residential ski trip in February 2017, the school worked with the police and the local authority designated officer, participating fully in their investigations and carrying out an investigation of its own.“Ms Drury left the school in July 2017. East Midlands Education Trust supported the school’s leadership between March 2017 and February 2018 before the school joined the Trust in March 2018.“The school seeks to reassure all parents/carers of students in our care that we take our safeguarding responsibilities extremely seriously, hence the action taken at the time.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.
