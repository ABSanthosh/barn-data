  "text": "KYIV — Russia launched a massive missile and drone attack on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities early Thursday, prompting a rare rebuke from President Donald Trump, who called the deadly attack “not necessary, and very bad timing.”“Vladimir, STOP!” he wrote on Truth Social, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump has generally refrained from criticizing Russia’s conduct of the war and has instead denounced Ukraine, claiming Kyiv is reluctant to end the conflict.The Russian attack killed at least 12 people and wounded about 90 others, emergency authorities said, in one of the deadliest attacks on the capital in nearly a year.The strike, the latest in a devastating series of Russian attacks on civilians, came as the White House pushes Kyiv to trade territory for peace without adequate security guarantees, enraging Ukrainians, who feel abandoned by Washington and are turning to Europe for support.France strongly backed Ukraine and its insistence on a ceasefire Thursday. French President Emmanuel Macron demanded that Putin must “finally stop lying” and respond to the offer for a truce.“When President Putin speaks to American negotiators, he tells them, ‘I want peace,’” Macron told BFMTV. “He continues to bombard Ukraine, he continues to kill.”Trump claimed Wednesday that Russia was ready for a deal, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was proving difficult. In fact, Ukraine accepted a U.S. proposal for a full ceasefire in March, but Russia did not. The White House has since proposed increasingly generous terms for Russia, including U.S. recognition of Russian sovereignty in the strategic Crimean Peninsula, which was invaded and illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014. Zelensky has demanded a ceasefire before he’ll talk about concessions.“I think Russia is ready,” Trump said Wednesday, hours before the deadly barrage. “I think we have a deal with Russia, and we have to get a deal with Zelensky.”“I thought it would be easier to deal with Zelensky, but it’s been harder,” he said.Zelensky arrived in South Africa on Thursday for talks but cut the trip short after the attack.“If Russia says it is ready for a ceasefire, then they should stop the massive strikes on Ukraine,” he said.At the scene of the attack, Ukrainians said they backed Zelensky’s approach.Kyiv municipal workers Oleh Gribanov and Maksym Krizhanovskiy, their coveralls and helmets dusty from clearing wreckage, expressed little surprise that Trump was finding it easier to work with Russia.“We don’t want to give our land away, and he wants us to give our land away and give up,” Gribanov said.“It’s easier to put a victim under pressure than an aggressor,” Krizhanovskiy said. Trump, he said, was “an imbecile.”The Post’s Siobhán O'Grady reports from the site of a Russian missile strike in Kyiv on April 24 during peace talks. (Video: Zoeann Murphy, Siobhán O'Grady, Naomi Schanen/The Washington Post)Confused residents wandered through the wreckage Thursday, clutching dogs and cats rescued from destroyed apartments, where families the night before had gone to sleep peacefully.Rescue workers took turns digging through rubble to search for signs of life as anxious relatives and friends watched. One man, who identified himself as a lawmaker who had grown up in the neighborhood, asked around about a man named Oleksandr. All he knew was that his friend’s red car sat crushed outside the impact site.A dust-covered woman, walking a black-and-white search dog named Maggie, said she was ready for a break after hours of work.The scene was all too familiar in Ukraine, where Russia has struck apartments again and again over the past three years: the rush of volunteers; the tents for tea, water and snacks; the police yelling at people to stay away from buildings that might collapse; the clatter of bits and pieces of lives tossed from windows above as bewildered survivors stare blankly at what used to be their homes.Antonina Pakhtusyva, 71, said she felt the world has abandoned the country.“Ukraine is destroyed, burned, covered in blood,” she said. “How many sons have died? And we ask for help, and they just humiliate us.”Her neighbor, Iryna Kukushnikva, 63, teared up. The people she felt most sorry for, she said, were the children — lives disrupted, or cut short. “We have lived through life already, but they are just starting out,” she said.She supported Zelensky’s decision to refuse a deal that many believe could condemn another generation to more war with Russia. “Zelensky is protecting his motherland — that’s why it’s difficult to deal with him,” she said. “Because he doesn’t sell his country out.”The death toll Thursday was unusually high for the capital, where advanced air defense systems generally make it better protected than other cities.Teens Vladyslav Muravik and Zakhar Holodryha skipped school Thursday to help clean up after the destruction. A friend lives in one of the damaged buildings.They have been following Trump’s peace plan closely.“The Americans are very demanding, with demands that are unfair to Ukrainians,” Holodryha, 15, said.“If Ukraine agrees to the demands that are set right now, in three or four years this war will start again,” said 14-year-old Muravik.As boys, they’re aware of the risks of the war dragging out: They fear they will one day be called up to fight Russia. Holodryha’s 31-year-old brother was conscripted while he waited at a bus stop. He’s now training for deployment to the front line.“Kyiv hasn’t heard terror this loud in a long time,” lawmaker Inna Sovsun wrote on X as the attack unfolded. “And amid all this, Trump says Russia is ready for peace? There’s nothing surreal like hearing promises of peace while hiding from ballistic missiles.”Washington has become increasingly frustrated by Zelensky’s position on a necessary ceasefire.U.S. officials have proposed freezing current battle lines, which would give Russia 20 percent of the country. Ukraine has also been told it will not be allowed to join NATO, the alliance Kyiv has long seen as the fastest, cheapest and safest way to protect the country from future attacks.Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday that the United States would walk away from the peace process if progress were not achieved soon.",
