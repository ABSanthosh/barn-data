  "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that a “specific component” of Iran’s nuclear program had been damaged in last month’s Israeli attack on Iranian military facilities.Netanyahu, who mentioned the attack in a speech before the Knesset, did not specify what the component was or offer details about the strike. It remains unclear what impact the Oct. 26 attack had on Iran’s nuclear research program.Live coverage contributors 14Gangs looting Gaza aid operate in areas under Israeli control, aid groups sayReturn to menuCAIRO — As Gaza’s hunger crisis worsens, organized gangs are stealing much of the aid Israel allows into the enclave, operating freely in areas controlled by the Israeli military, according to aid group officials, humanitarian workers, transport companies and witnesses.Officials said criminal looting has become the greatest impediment to distributing aid in the southern half of Gaza, home to the vast majority of displaced Palestinians. Armed bands of men have killed, beaten and kidnapped aid truck drivers in the area around Israel’s Kerem Shalom crossing, the main entry point into Gaza’s south, aid workers and transport companies said.The thieves, who have run cigarette-smuggling operations throughout this year but are now also stealing food and other supplies, are tied to local crime families, residents say. The gangs are described by observers as rivals of Hamas and, in some cases, they have been targeted by remnants of Hamas’s security forces in other parts of the enclave.An internal United Nations memo obtained by The Washington Post concluded last month that the gangs “may be benefiting from a passive if not active benevolence” or “protection” from the Israel Defense Forces. One gang leader, the memo said, established a “military like compound” in an area “restricted, controlled and patrolled by the IDF.”Aid organizations say Israeli authorities have denied most of their requests for better measures to safeguard convoys, including appeals for safer routes, more open crossings and permission to allow Gaza’s civilian police to protect the trucks. Israeli forces within view of the attacks have also failed on multiple occasions to intervene as looting was underway, aid workers, U.N. officials, transport workers and truck drivers say.The Israeli military has denied the allegations, saying in a statement that its troops have carried out “targeted countermeasures” against the looters “with an emphasis on targeting the terrorists and preventing collateral damage to the aid trucks and the elements of the international community.” The IDF is “working to enable and facilitate the transfer of aid,” the statement added.This is an excerpt from a full story.U.S. envoy to travel to Lebanon in sign of possible progress on cease-fireReturn to menuBEIRUT — In a sign of possible progress toward a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein is traveling to Lebanon, a U.S. official said Monday, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic activities.The visit comes after the Biden administration presented a cease-fire proposal to intermediaries for Hezbollah’s consideration, Lebanese officials said, and as Israel and Hezbollah on Monday escalated deadly cross-border attacks.The U.S. official cautioned against interpreting Hochstein’s trip as a sign that a deal is imminent. A Western diplomat briefed on the negotiations echoed the sentiment, saying in a text message that while the U.S. cease-fire proposal was seen as “progress in itself,” no “breakthrough” was expected.Still, Lebanese officials expressed cautious optimism about the diplomatic developments. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said in a television interview with Al-Araby TV that the proposal was “positive” but needed “clarification.”A media adviser to Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who is serving as a mediator in the talks, also said the mood was positive. The adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss delicate negotiations, said issues in the proposal that still need to be worked out include how Israeli soldiers would withdraw from Lebanon, as well as a mechanism for rebuilding the south of the country.The proposal did not include stipulations that Israel would be allowed to “interfere” militarily against Hezbollah in Lebanon after the cease-fire, as Israeli media outlets had reported, the aide said.Israel carried out an airstrike in a densely populated neighborhood in central Beirut on Monday evening, several hundred yards from the prime minister’s office and other government buildings. The attack — the third in central Beirut in two days — killed at least five people and injured 24, Lebanon’s Health Ministry said.One woman was killed and dozens were injured in northern and central Israel by rocket barrages fired from Lebanon, emergency responders said. The woman, Safa Awwad, was killed when a rocket directly hit the residential home where she was staying in Shfar’am, east of Haifa.U.S. imposes sanctions on Israeli settlers and groups over West Bank violenceReturn to menuThe Biden administration on Nov. 18 sanctioned an Israeli group that builds illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. (Video: The Washington Post)The Biden administration on Monday imposed sanctions against groups and individuals that it says are linked to violence and theft of property in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, including Amana, the largest Israeli group involved in settlement development.The U.S. Treasury Department said that Amana provides support, including financing and building infrastructure, to settlers and farms in the West Bank. Some of Amana’s clients are already the subjects of U.S. sanctions. The Treasury said Amana plays a “key role” in expanding settlements from which settlers “commit violence” and “seize land.”“The United States, along with our allies and partners, remains committed to holding accountable those who seek to facilitate these destabilizing activities, which threaten the stability of the West Bank, Israel and the wider region,” Wally Adeyemo, deputy treasury secretary, said in a statement.Most countries consider Israel’s settlements in the West Bank to be illegal under international law. The United States held that same position until the Trump administration abandoned it in 2019. The Biden administration said this year that it considered West Bank settlements “illegitimate.”The United Kingdom and Canada had previously imposed sanctions on Amana. The U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctions also target a subsidiary of Amana called Binyanei Bar Amana, a construction company that builds and sells homes in West Bank settlements and outposts.The U.S. State Department on Monday also imposed sanctions on Eyal Hari Yehuda Company, which provides pickup trucks and other vehicles to settler groups against which the United States has previously levied sanctions, and the company’s owner, Itamar Yehuda Levi.The sanctions also target Zohar Sabah, who the State Department says has “demonstrated a pattern of destructiveness in the West Bank” and carried out violence against Palestinians, including an attack on an elementary school near Jericho in September that injured several Palestinian children.“We once again call on the government of Israel to take action and hold accountable those responsible for or complicit in violence, forced displacement and the dispossession of private land,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.The sanctions will block the entities and individuals from accessing any property or assets held in the United States and prevent them from receiving any goods, services or goods that pass through U.S. financial institutions.Since late 2022, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government has expanded Israel’s footprint in the occupied West Bank, where an estimated 3 million Palestinians live alongside more than 500,000 settlers.Israel prepares Lebanon cease-fire plan as ‘gift’ to Trump, officials sayIsrael prepares Lebanon cease-fire plan as ‘gift’ to Trump, officials sayA timeline of conflict on the Israel-Lebanon border A timeline of conflict on the Israel-Lebanon border Israeli military deaths in Lebanon raise questions over war’s scope Israeli military deaths in Lebanon raise questions over war’s scope",
