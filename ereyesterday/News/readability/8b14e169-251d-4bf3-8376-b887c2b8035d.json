  "text": "Humanitarian groups and some Arab nations, including mediators Qatar and Egypt, condemned Israel’s decision Sunday to halt the entry of all aid into war-battered Gaza.The United Nations’ humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, described the move as “alarming,” saying that access to aid must be allowed under international law. Oxfam said aid is a “fundamental right” of civilians with urgent needs and “not a bargaining chip.”Saudi Arabia said the “use of aid as a tool of extortion and collective punishment” violates international law. Qatar, a key negotiator in the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, accused Israel of violating the agreement. Egypt and Jordan also sharply criticized Israel’s decision, which comes at the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan.The first phase of the ceasefire ended Saturday without a resolution on what comes next. Talks on the second phase, which stipulates a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, did not materialize. Now, Israel is pushing for an extension of the first phase, calling it a “temporary ceasefire” for 50 days, which would bring the release of more hostages and negotiations for the next phase.Hamas officials argue that it does not make sense to release more hostages — the group’s strongest leverage in talks — without Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreeing to withdraw from Gaza and to formally declare an end to the war. A former Egyptian official briefed on the talks told The Washington Post that Egypt, a mediator between Hamas and Israel, supports Hamas’s rejection of Israel’s temporary ceasefire proposal and is pushing to resume negotiations to reach the ceasefire’s second phase. The former official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic talks.Hamas criticized Israel’s aid stoppage Sunday and accused it of reneging on the agreement. The only way to secure the release of more hostages is to “immediately enter into negotiations to begin the second phase,” Hamas said in a statement.Here’s what else to knowA 70-year-old man was killed and four others wounded in a stabbing attack Monday at a bus station in Haifa, Israeli police said, describing the incident as a terrorist attack. The assailant, an Israeli Druze citizen, was killed at the scene, police added. Hamas praised the attack and described it as a “natural response to the crimes of the occupation.”Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he would depart this evening for a visit to the United States at the request of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. In a statement, Smotrich also said Israel could cut off electricity and water to Gaza after the aid stoppage before “unleashing hell” on the Strip with a new offensive.Live coverage contributors 9With the ceasefire in peril, Arab leaders rush a plan for Gaza’s future Return to menuCAIRO — A faltering ceasefire in Gaza and President Donald Trump’s proposal to displace its residents have lit a fire under Arab leaders to come up with a plan for the enclave’s future — one that ensures Palestinians remain there while also sidelining Hamas and empowering a committee of technocrats to oversee reconstruction after a devastating war.The region’s heavyweights, led by Egypt, are racing to finalize a proposal ahead of an emergency summit of Arab League states in Cairo on Tuesday. The sense of urgency was heightened Sunday when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he was halting all aid to Gaza, accusing Hamas of rejecting a U.S.-backed offer to extend the first phase of the ceasefire, which took effect Jan. 19. Israel, however, has delayed negotiations over the deal’s second phase.The Egypt-led plan, which will be presented to all 22 member states, calls for an Arab-led reconstruction effort that would develop over stages and allow Palestinians to stay in temporary housing while their neighborhoods are rebuilt, according to Egyptian officials and business leaders who were briefed on the initiativeThe goal is to offer an alternative to Trump’s proposal, which was first floated in February, to take over Gaza, expel its population and transform the territory into a “Riviera of the Middle East.” Trump’s announcement shocked the world and angered U.S. allies, including Egypt and Jordan, where officials say a mass influx of Palestinians would pose an existential threat.In response, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington would “provide an opportunity” for Arab countries to “develop a plan.” Otherwise, he suggested, Trump’s proposal was the only game in town.Arab leaders have spent the past weeks doing just that, with Egypt leading the charge to develop a joint vision for the territory’s postwar period. A closed-door meeting of officials from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, last month didn’t produce a unified stance. But since then, leading Arab states have worked to narrow their differences and are coalescing around a single plan, according to current and former officials, diplomats and analysts in the region.This is an excerpt from a full story.Concern mounts in Gaza over food prices as Israel halts aidReturn to menuIsrael’s decision to halt deliveries of aid to Gaza on Sunday led to concern about a sudden surge in food prices amid fears that a fragile ceasefire could soon break down.Mohammed al-Najjar, a 34-year-old father of six children living in the coastal al-Mawasi area, said he had seen the price of some foods more than quadruple since the news spread. “A bag of flour used to cost 40 shekels, but yesterday it became 90, and some merchants sold it for 120,” he said in a message.“As a family, we tried to buy as much food as we could, fearing that these goods would be completely lost from the markets, especially since we are in the month of Ramadan,” al-Najjar said, referring to the Islamic holy month that sees Muslims abstain from eating and drinking during the day. Before the war, his family had mostly relied on food aid rather than the markets, he added.Israel stopped the delivery of aid to Gaza over the weekend, arguing that it was being intercepted by Hamas. “Hamas steals the supplies and prevents the people of Gaza from getting them. It uses these supplies to finance its terror machine, which is aimed directly at Israel and our civilians — and this we cannot accept,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a message released Sunday.The Gaza Government Media Office has tried to reassure Palestinians, claiming publicly that there was enough food for several weeks. In statements on social media, the office said local authorities will punish anyone who hoards or attempts to raise prices for basic commodities.The aid stoppage comes as Israel has been trying to pressure Hamas to extend the first stage of the current ceasefire proposal instead of moving to the second stage, which would call for an Israeli withdrawal from the strip, which Hamas is seeking.Al-Najjar said his family had been displaced several times during the war and feared a return to fighting. “We do not have the energy to go through this experience again,” he said. “We hope that the two parties will reach realistic solutions that will end this war forever and allow us to live in peace.”He added that he blamed not only Israel for the situation but also Hamas and the Palestinian merchants who were happy to raise prices despite the human cost. “For the first time, we find ourselves under the jaws of a three-pronged pliers,” he said. ‘No Other Land’ director criticizes U.S. policy on Gaza after Oscar win Return to menu“No Other Land,” a film about Israeli displacement of a Palestinian community, won the Oscar for best documentary feature Sunday night.The film, made by a Palestinian-Israeli collective, documents the forced eviction of Palestinians from their homes in the rural Masafer Yatta region of the West Bank by Israeli soldiers.“There is a different path, a political solution without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both of our people,” Israeli investigative journalist and director Yuval Abraham said about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict after winning the award, in one of the most politically charged speeches of the night.“The foreign policy in this country is helping to block this path,” he said, referring to the United States.Co-director Basel Adra, who became a father recently, said he hoped his daughter would “not have to live the same life I am living now — always fearing settler violence, home demolitions and forceful displacements that my community is living and facing every day.”“‘No Other Land’ reflects the harsh reality that we have been enduring for decades,” he added.Despite winning critical acclaim, the documentary could not find a U.S. distributor and was self-distributed instead.Amnesty International said last month that the Palestinian community is “at imminent risk of forcible transfer due to increasing state-backed settler attacks, as well as home demolitions, restrictions on access to land and illegal settlement expansion by the Israeli authorities.”The region, known in Arabic as Masafer Yatta and in English as the South Hebron Hills, has been subjected to decades of demolition and evictions. But rights groups say the situation has “significantly worsened” since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel by Hamas.Janay Kingsberry contributed to this report.Humanitarian groups say aid to Gaza must not be a ‘bargaining chip’Return to menuHumanitarian groups and senior aid officials condemned Israel’s decision Sunday to block relief and other supplies from entering the Gaza Strip.The British charity Oxfam said the move, which comes as the Islamic holy month of Ramadan begins, is “a reckless act of collective punishment” prohibited under international humanitarian law. Aid is a “fundamental right” of civilians who are experiencing urgent needs, and “not a bargaining chip,” Oxfam said.Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas has saved many lives and “offered a beacon of hope amid unimaginable suffering” over the past six weeks. But “any unraveling of the forward momentum” that was created in that time “risks plunging people back into despair,” she said.The ICRC, which helped facilitate the return of hostages and detainees under the ceasefire, said every effort must be made to maintain the ceasefire, save lives and reunite more families.Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the United Nations secretary general, urged in a statement to reporters that all parties “make every effort to prevent a return to hostilities in Gaza.” He also called for aid to immediately flow back into Gaza and for the release of all hostages.Doctors Without Borders said “humanitarian aid should never be used as a tool of war.” Regardless of negotiations between warring parties, Gazans still need a massive scale-up of humanitarian supplies, the international medical aid group said.“Israel is once again blocking an entire population from receiving aid, using it as a bargaining chip. This is unacceptable, outrageous, and will have devastating consequences,” said the group’s emergency coordinator, Caroline Seguin. She added that the news had already caused food prices to spike.In photos: Gazans observe somber start to RamadanReturn to menuPalestinians in Gaza this past weekend marked the beginning of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month that is a time for worship, reflection, giving and gatherings. Over the month, Muslims abstain from eating and drinking during the day, starting their daily fast after their first meal of suhoor before sunrise and breaking it at the iftar meal at dusk.In Gaza, the start to the sacred month — which is celebrated with festive gatherings over the first communal iftar meal — was overshadowed by fears that the ceasefire agreement with Israel that had kept hostilities relatively at bay in the besieged enclave was expiring. On Sunday, the second day of Ramadan, Israel said it blocked the entry of all humanitarian aid into Gaza.",
