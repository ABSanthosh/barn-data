  "text": "HORRY COUNTY, S.C. (WBTW) — An arctic cold front is expected to move through the region Sunday night, bringing bitterly cold temperatures and potential wintry weather through midweek.News13 meteorologist Scotty Powell says “brutally cold temperatures” that could be at or below freezing for up to 60 hours is possible, potentially leading to power outages, pipes bursting and deadly conditions for pets left outside.“In total, this is going to be a short-lived system but the impacts may last for days because temperatures will continue to be excessively cold and below average all week,” News13’s Hannah Rahner said.The Grand Strand hasn’t seen a significant snow event since 2014.“High temperatures on Monday are forecast to be in the upper-30s with highs in the low and mid-30s possible for Tuesday and Wednesday. Nighttime temperatures will be in the teens and lower-20s which in itself is a threat for freezing pipes and high heat demand,” she said.Between Tuesday and Friday, temperatures could be the coldest in decades, rivalling the all-time lows of between 0 and 13 degrees in Florence, 14 to 18 degrees in North Myrtle Beach and minus one degree to 10 degrees in Lumberton.On top of the polar air, a low-pressure system moving off the southeast coast may bring snow and sleet from the Grand Strand back to the Pee Dee.“It’s still too early to know the exact track, but when that is figured out we will be able to give out accumulation expectations,” Powell said. “For now, you should make sure that your house is ready for the cold with emergency kits on standby in your house and car in case you’re stranded on the roadway.”Emergency management agencies along the Grand Strand and Pee Dee say they’re closely monitoring the system’s track.* * *Adam Benson joined the News13 digital team in January 2024.
