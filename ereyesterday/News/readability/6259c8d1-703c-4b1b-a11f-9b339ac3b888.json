  "text": "At least 10 people were killed in a shooting at a high school in Austria’s second-largest city, Graz, on Tuesday, police said, and several were seriously injured. Gun violence is rare in Austria, and residents and politicians expressed shock over the attack.The shooter also killed himself, said Gerald Ortner, director of police for the state of Styria, of which Graz is the capital. The shooter, a 21-year-old local man, was previously unknown to the authorities, Ortner said.The man had attended the school as a student but never graduated, Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said.Police wrote early Tuesday that shots were heard inside the BORG Dreierschützengasse school in Graz and that an emergency operation was underway. The situation was under control by 11:30 a.m. local time, with the school evacuated and everyone taken to a safe meeting point, the police said in a later statement.“Today is a dark day in the history of our country,” Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker said at a Tuesday afternoon news conference in Graz, adding: “There are no words to express the pain, disbelief and grief felt by the whole of Austria. Our country stands still in this moment of horror.”School shootings are uncommon in Austria, where gun violence is rare.Before Tuesday’s attack, Austria had two public mass shootings since 2000, compared with 119 in the same period in the United States, according to Jason R. Silva, a member of the Regional Gun Violence Research Consortium at the Rockefeller Institute of Government. Neither of those two shootings in Austria occurred at a school.Silva defines public mass shootings as those that occur “in a public or populated location,” and in which at least four people are killed and some victims are “targeted at random and/or for their symbolic value.”Karner confirmed that nine people were killed in the shooting — six female and three male victims. The authorities did not immediately disclose whether the victims were students or staff members, and said they would not release further information until an initial investigation was completed.A 10th victim died later at a hospital, the police said.At least 11 people were injured, according to police. Graz University Hospital said in a statement Tuesday afternoon that it was treating two patients in critical condition as well as five with serious injuries.Ortner, the police director, said authorities believe the shooter killed himself in a restroom.Police confirmed that two legally owned weapons — a long gun and a handgun — were used in the attack and recovered at the scene. “At present, no information can be given about the motive,” Ortner said, noting that the investigation would continue.Officials said Austria will observe three days of mourning, during which flags will be flown at half-staff on public buildings. A minute’s silence will also be held nationwide Wednesday morning.President Alexander Van der Bellen said, “This horror is impossible to put into words.”“These were young people who had their whole lives ahead of them. A teacher who accompanied them on their journey,” Van der Bellen said in a statement posted on X. He added: “Austria mourns.”Michael Ludwig, the mayor of Vienna, issued a statement offering condolences to “the victims, their families, and all those who are now experiencing immeasurable suffering.”Graz, which has a population of around 300,000 and is in Austria’s southeast, also experienced a deadly attack almost 10 years ago, on June 20, 2015, when a man drove a car into the crowd in the center of the city, killing three people and injuring dozens.Austria’s most recent mass shooting, according to Silva’s database, occurred in 2020, when a man in Vienna killed four people before being fatally shot by police. The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for that attack.",
