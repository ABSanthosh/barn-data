  "text": "Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)A powerful earthquake measuring 6.1 magnitude struck off the southern coast of the Greek island of Kasos early Wednesday, rattling parts of the eastern Mediterranean but causing no immediate reports of damage.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the offshore quake hit at 1:51 am (local time) at a depth of around 78 kilometres. The epicentre was located approximately 15 kilometres from Fry, the capital of Kasos, and about 112 kilometres from Ágios Nikólaos on Crete.Shaking from the tremor was widely felt across the region, including on the Greek islands of Crete, Kasos, Karpathos, and parts of the Dodecanese, as well as in mainland Greece. According to BNO News, tremors were also reported in Israel and Egypt, highlighting the quake’s reach across the eastern Mediterranean.Preliminary assessments from the USGS indicated that moderate shaking likely occurred on Kasos and Karpathos islands, and in eastern Crete, while light shaking extended to other Aegean islands and even into southwestern Turkey.Authorities have not confirmed any injuries or structural harm so far. Greece is located in a seismically active region where the African and Eurasian tectonic plates converge. This area, known as the Hellenic Arc, has a history of producing powerful and occasionally destructive earthquakes.More information is awaited as monitoring agencies continue to assess the impact.This is a developing story.",
