  "text": "Ryan Walters (Picture credit: X)A top education official in the US state of Oklahoma is facing criticism after ordering public schools to show students a video promoting a new department of religious freedom and patriotism.State superintendent Ryan Walters, a Republican, announced the department on Wednesday, claiming it will address attacks on religious liberty and patriotism by “woke teachers' unions.” The new office will operate under the state's department of education.On Thursday, Walters emailed school superintendents demanding they show his video announcement to all students and send it to parents. “In one of the first steps of the newly created department, we are requiring all of Oklahoma schools to play the attached video to all kids that are enrolled,” the email read.In the video, Walters claims that religious liberty has been attacked and patriotism mocked \"by woke teachers unions,\" before praying for US leaders. “In particular, I pray for President Donald Trump and his team as they continue to bring about change to the country,” Walters said in the video.He further said that students are not required to participate in the prayer.According to Walters, the new department will “oversee the investigation of abuses to individual religious freedom or displays of patriotism.”Two of Oklahoma's largest school districts, Edmond and Bixby, have said they will not show the video. Oklahoma City Public Schools is reviewing the matter.Oklahoma attorney general Gentner Drummond’s office declared Walters’ mandate unlawful.“Not only is this edict unenforceable, it is contrary to parents’ rights, local control, and individual free-exercise rights,” the statement read.This is not the first time Walters' actions have drawn legal challenges. He is currently facing two lawsuits over a June mandate requiring schools to incorporate the Bible into lesson plans for grades 5 through 12, a directive several districts have refused to follow.",
