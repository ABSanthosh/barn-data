  "text": "JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday described “intensified” operations in Gaza, including a massive relocation of the Palestinian population and indefinite Israeli military “control” of large swaths of the enclave, setting a new direction in strategy and raising the question of whether Israel is inching toward the long-term reoccupation of the enclave.The plan, unanimously approved in a meeting of Netanyahu’s security cabinet Sunday night, will require tens of thousands of reservists to be called up in the coming weeks. Palestinian civilians living in areas of northern and southern Gaza would be displaced and confined within “sterile zones” secured by elements of the Israel Defense Forces, while other troops would continue efforts to root out Hamas fighters and destroy their tunnels.The zones, under a separate cabinet decision, would include new “hubs,” built by Israel and protected by U.S. security contractors, from which humanitarian aid would be distributed to Palestinians — though only those designated and vetted by Israel. Netanyahu’s government has banned all humanitarian assistance from entering Gaza since it ended a brief ceasefire two months ago, leading to what the United Nations has called near-starvation conditions.Israeli officials indicated that urgent implementation of both plans is tied to the visit of President Donald Trump to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, scheduled to begin May 13. Officials described the four-day trip as a “window of opportunity” for agreement on a 50-day ceasefire and hostage release proposed by Trump Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.Hamas has rejected the proposal unless Israel agrees to terms of an eventual withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war. Netanyahu’s government has refused that demand, saying that Hamas must be destroyed.Asked Monday by reporters at the White House if he supported Israel’s decision to expand the war, Trump did not respond directly, saying only that “people are starving, and we’re going to help them get some food.” He echoed Israeli charges, denied by aid organizations, that Hamas was responsible for “taking everything that’s being brought in.”Brian Hughes, a spokesman for Trump’s National Security Council, said that the “president has made clear the consequences Hamas will face if it continues to hold hostages, including American Edan Alexander, and the bodies of four Americans.” Alexander is one of up to 24 hostages believed to still be alive inside Gaza.In a video statement released Monday, Netanyahu said the IDF will no longer “enter and then withdraw” from combat zones in Gaza as it has in the past, a strategy that allowed Hamas to move back into cleared areas. “We’re not doing that anymore — that’s not the intention,” Netanyahu said. “The intention is the opposite.”In Israel, announcement of the new plan immediately sparked a furious debate over whether it set Israel on a course to eventually conquer outright or even administer the entire Strip. That has been a long-standing demand of not just Netanyahu’s far-right political allies, who hope to expel Palestinian residents to faraway countries and reestablish Jewish settlements, but also an idea favored by military hard-liners, who argue that a complete takeover of Gaza and an extended counterinsurgency operation are the only way to achieve Netanyahu’s stated goal of eliminating Hamas.“The implications could be a drift — without any formal decision — into a de facto situation of occupying the Gaza Strip and taking responsibility for the fate of 2 million Palestinians, with all the consequences that entails, both for Israel’s international standing, its economic situation and for the IDF,” said Ofer Shelah, a former lawmaker who is now a researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. “The IDF can always withdraw — as has happened before — but the chances of such an agreement are decreasing.”For months, Israeli leaders have debated the option of launching a full-scale conquest of Gaza that would require at least 60,000 troops, according to a former official directly involved in the planning. But some military commanders resisted that scenario, saying that the IDF lacks the personnel to conquer and control all of Gaza, and that a full-scale invasion would endanger the lives of the remaining hostages — a politically explosive issue in Israel, the former official said.The plan was condemned by the Hostage Families Forum, which represents the majority of relatives of those held in Gaza.“The government admitted this morning that it is choosing territory over hostages, and this is against the will of over 70 percent of the people,” the families said in statement, referring to polls that show the majority of Israelis favor a deal to recover all hostages, even if it means ending the war before Hamas’s total defeat.But on Monday, Netanyahu’s finance minister, the settler leader Bezalel Smotrich, said conquering all of Gaza should be the war’s primary objective.There will be “no retreat from the territories we have conquered, not even in exchange for hostages,” Smotrich said at a conference in Jerusalem. “Once we stay in Gaza, we can talk about [declaring] sovereignty.”Immediately, opposition leaders warned that the new strategy was paving the way for the annexation of Gaza advocated by Smotrich and his far-right ally, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, whose support Netanyahu needs to prevent his governing coalition from collapsing.“This is no longer a temporary operation but a move that prepares for a permanent presence in the area, part of making Ben Gvir and Smotrich’s fantasies into reality,” said Yair Golan, the leader of the left-leaning Democrats party and a retired IDF general. “The de facto occupation of the Gaza Strip in the name of ‘survival of the government’ will cost us blood — in the lives of the hostages, in soldiers’ lives, through exhaustion and most importantly through losing our way.”The Trump administration has been reluctant to be seen as backing Israel’s plans, as the president has turned his attention to Persian Gulf countries where he hopes to conclude trade, investment and defense agreements.“The administration is involved only to the extent that the president does not wish to be seen as a loser on an issue that he declared he would resolve,” said a person familiar with administration deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the sensitive issue.“He wants it resolved by the time he’s in the region,” and Trump’s interest now is “in not having an embarrassment,” this person said, adding that the path to deals in the gulf “lies through not having this bleeding sore of Gaza.”The participation of at least some humanitarian organizations is seen as essential to aid distribution under the Israeli plan. But most of those groups operating inside Gaza have coalesced around a statement from the U.N. assistance-coordination body, issued Sunday, refusing to participate “in any scheme that does not adhere to the global humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality.”Some have withheld individual statements rejecting the aid plan while awaiting an announcement on its implementation, but have criticized it as grossly insufficient to the need and called it discriminatory and illegal.“Under international humanitarian law,” a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross noted, “Israel has an obligation to use all means available to ensure that the basic needs of the civilian population under its control are met.”“Moving aid into fenced, supervised spaces under military or private contractor control recalls some of the darkest chapters of human failure,” said Bushra Khalidi, West Bank policy lead for Oxfam. “That’s not protection, that’s coercion. We would never support any model that would be treating civilians basically as prisoners.”",
