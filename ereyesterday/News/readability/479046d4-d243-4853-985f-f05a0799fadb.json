  "text": "Cecilia Macaulay \u0026 Anne SoyBBC NewsWar-torn Sudan is now \"on the brink\" of a public health disaster as cholera and other deadly diseases spread, aid group, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) has warned.In just one week, Sudan's Health Ministry recorded that 172 people have died due to a cholera outbreak, posting on Facebook that most of the new cases are in Khartoum state. According to local doctors, cited by Sudanese media, drone attacks have caused power outages at water purification stations, which has left people with no choice but to use unclean water.IRC country director for Sudan Eatizaz Yousif said the civil war - now in its thrid year - \"is fuelling the resurgence of cholera\".In a statement, the IRC emphasised that cholera vaccine coverage was \"low\" and \"essential supplies dwindling\".The medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has warned of reports of \"thousands of suspected cholera cases\" in Khartoum since the middle of last month.Its medical co-ordinator in the country, Slaymen Ammar, stated that \"the conflict has clearly compromised basic infrastructure\".In a press release, he said that healthcare in parts of the capital was \"either unavailable or unaffordable\", adding that \"many of the remaining health workers had no choice but to leave\" due to fighting.Mr Ammar adds that the few remaining health facilities are overwhelmed.As many as 500 cases of cholera were reported in just one day in the past week in Khartoum, MSF said.Aside from the Khartoum area, cases were also cited in northern and southern Sudan, the AFP news agency reports.Most people with cholera have mild symptoms or none at all. However, the disease can be a fatal if it causes severe diarrhoea, requiring antibiotics and IV fluids for treatment, according to the World Health Organization.More than 150,000 people have been killed during Sudan's conflict, which began over two years ago when Sudan's army and the RSF began a vicious struggle for power.Millions have been forced from their homes and the conflict has plunged the country into what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis.",
