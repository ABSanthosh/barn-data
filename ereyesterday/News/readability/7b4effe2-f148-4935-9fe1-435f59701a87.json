  "text": "KYIV — Nine civilians were killed and seven injured early Saturday when a Russian drone hit a minibus evacuating residents in the Sumy region, in northeastern Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said, less than a day after the first face-to-face negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv since early 2022.Ukraine’s authorities said Russia used a Lancet attack drone to hit the minibus traveling down a near-empty road around 6:17 a.m. local time. The Russian Lancet strikes rely upon intelligence given to it by nearby reconnaissance drones, which have first-person view. “This is not just another shelling — it is a cynical war crime,” Ukraine’s National Police wrote on Telegram.Local authorities said the injured and dead victims were mainly pension-aged women, and on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a family, including a mother, father and child, were among those killed. He called the attack a “deliberate killing of civilians” and said that Russia could choose to stop the killings and agree to a ceasefire. Authorities have declared three days of mourning.The Russian Ministry of Defense said it had struck a “site with Ukrainian military hardware in the Sumy region,” according to Interfax news agency.Zelensky called on Europe and the United States to strengthen sanctions to push Russia toward ceasing its three-year assault. “Without stronger sanctions, without stronger pressure on Russia, they will not seek real diplomacy,” Zelensky said Saturday.The attack comes just a day after Russian and Ukrainian representatives met for direct talks for the first time in three years in Istanbul on Friday.Earlier last week, there was cautious optimism that Russia might consider agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire to escape the “massive” sanctions threatened by European Union leaders in Kyiv on May 10.But that hope started to fade by Thursday when Russia sent a low-level delegation to Turkey and continued to press for maximalist demands, which include Kyiv ceding large areas of Ukrainian territory not yet occupied by Russia.The two sides did agree, however, to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war. If it goes ahead, this will be by far the largest prisoner swap since the war began.The diplomacy now seems dependent on President Donald Trump, who said on Thursday that he believed a one-on-one meeting between him and Russian President Vladimir Putin could still resolve the war. Trump added on Friday however, that sanctions were still on the table, “Honestly, I will [impose sanctions], if we’re not going to make a deal,” Trump told Fox News.The spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, wouldn’t be drawn on details of what conditions for a ceasefire were discussed in Istanbul. Peskov said that a meeting between Zelensky and Putin would only be possible once certain issues had been agreed upon.Following Russia’s unilateral ceasefire to mark the end of World War II between May 7 and 9, there were was a short-lived slowdown in attacks on certain days, with only 10 Russian drones over Ukrainian skies on May 13.But this latest attack on the minibus — which had no military markings, according to local authorities — indicates that Russia has resumed daily attacks.The minibus was carrying civilians from the Sumy region border town of Bilopillia, which along with another nearby town, received orders to urgently evacuate last week, local authorities said.Like many towns closer to the Russian border in the Sumy region, the residents of Bilopillia have been subject to almost weekly, and sometimes daily, attacks by FAB-500 glide bombs carrying a 1,100-pound payload. In April, Russia targeted the small towns with four FABs in a day. On one day in August, 11 FAB bombs were used, Ukrainian air defense forces said.Ukraine has said for over a year that Russia wants to occupy areas of the Sumy region. Ukraine’s own incursion into Russia’s southern Kursk region in August was an apparent attempt to prevent Russia from entering Sumy. But, after nine months of heavy fighting, Ukrainian forces now only occupy a slither of Russian territory and Russian forces, backed by North Korean units, appear to have gained the upper hand around Sumy.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on social media that Saturday’s attack showed the “pressure on Moscow must be increased to put an end to Russian terror.”The E.U. said on Thursday that it was readying more sanctions against Russia after the Kremlin rejected its ceasefire proposal.",
