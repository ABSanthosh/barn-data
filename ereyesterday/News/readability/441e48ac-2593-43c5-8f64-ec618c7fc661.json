Japan will pay Reciprocal Tariffs to the United States of 15%.\"Trump has been under pressure to wrap up trade pacts after promising a flurry of deals ahead of his August 1 tariff deadline.The announced deal with Japan follows agreements struck in recent weeks with the Philippines, Indonesia, Britain and Vietnam.It also comes after Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faced a bruising weekend election that left his coalition without a majority in the upper house. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",
