  "text": "US President Donald Trump's supporters are now calling for his face to be carved on Mount Rushmore, reports The Daily Beast.Trump's former aide Corey Lewandowski initiated this discussion during his appearance on a conservative social media programme, suggesting it as a constitutionally appropriate alternative to extending Trump's presidency beyond two terms.\"Some really smart congressman should go and say, Donald Trump's face on Mount Rushmore,\" Lewandowski told Benny Johnson, host of The Benny Show.\"What are we waiting on? We got the votes in the House. We got the votes in the Senate. I know a guy is gonna sign it, named Donald John Trump. Let's get it done to memorialize what this man's been able to achieve for this country,\" he added.The suggestion received immediate support on X, with The Benny Show's executive producer, Alex Lorusso, sharing the video while asking which legislator would initiate this proposal.Meanwhile, Representative Anna Paulina Luna, a staunch Trump supporter from Florida, responded to Lorusso withing minutes and said that she has begun preparing the necessary paperwork.\"I'm actually filing the legislation as we speak,\" she wrote.The proposal aims to add Trump alongside the existing presidents - George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln - on the Mount Rushmore monument in South Dakota. The presidential sculptures, completed in 1941, feature heads measuring approximately 60 feet in height.This marks another attempt by Trump's supporters to secure his place on this significant American monument.Earlier, Trump's staff contacted South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem in 2019 to understand the requirements for adding another presidential sculpture to the monument, according to The New York Times' 2020 reportIn 2018, Noem disclosed that being featured on Mount Rushmore remains one of the president's aspirations. Trump reportedly expressed this desire during their meeting in the Oval Office. \"I started laughing. He wasn't laughing, so he was totally serious,\" she said.",
