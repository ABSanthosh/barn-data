  "text": "Here are the latest developments.President Trump offered what appeared to be reassurance on Thursday that Ukraine would be involved in negotiations to end the war with Russia, something that his comments a day earlier had left in question.“Of course they would,” he said in the Oval Office, in response to a reporter’s question about whether Ukraine would have a place at the negotiating table. “I mean, they’re part of it. We would have Ukraine, we would have Russia and we would have other people involved, too.”When Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had begun talks to end the war, he notably made no mention of Ukraine taking part in the negotiations — an omission that triggered alarm throughout nations allied with Ukraine in Europe, which feared Kyiv’s interests would be sidelined in the process. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said on Thursday, “We, as a sovereign country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us.”After speaking by phone with Mr. Putin on Wednesday — he then also spoke with Mr. Zelensky — Mr. Trump had suggested that borders could be redrawn, that NATO membership for Ukraine could be withheld and that Ukraine and European allies could be left out of talks.On Thursday, in meetings and statements, European officials asserted Kyiv’s right — and their own — to be at the negotiating table, and argued against prematurely surrendering critical bargaining chips like territorial borders and NATO membership. Some of the United States’ closest allies, including Britain and Germany, were among those trying to reassert Europe’s standing in decisions affecting the continent’s security.“Europe must be involved in the negotiations — and I think that’s very easy to understand,” Boris Pistorius, Germany’s defense minister, told reporters after a NATO meeting in Brussels.The continent, he said, “will have to live directly” with the consequences of any deal and may have “to play a central or the main role in the peace order.”And John Healey, Britain’s defense secretary, said, “Let’s not forget, Russia remains a threat well beyond Ukraine.” He added, speaking of Ukraine, “It’s our job as defense ministers here at NATO to put them in the best position to secure a lasting peace through strength.”Other issues troubling to Ukraine and its European allies remain, including that both Mr. Trump and his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, have signaled a willingness to make concessions to Russia that Ukraine had long called unacceptable. After Mr. Trump’s call with Mr. Putin, he told reporters that it was “unlikely” Ukraine would return to its pre-2014 borders and said future NATO membership for the country was not “practical.”Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 with claims to territory that were widely rejected by most of the world. Russia has also sought to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO’s military alliance, portraying its membership as a national security threat, while Ukraine has sought to accelerate its application since the war began.Here’s what else to know:A win for Putin: Mr. Trump’s comments on Wednesday were the clearest sign yet that Mr. Putin could still emerge from the grinding war in Ukraine with a redrawn map of Europe and renewed Russian influence.Zelensky’s tough spot: The apparent thaw in U.S.-Russian relations places the Ukrainian president in a daunting position. With the Trump administration appearing to demand concessions from Ukraine, including mineral rights, in exchange for continued U.S. support, analysts said that Mr. Zelensky had little choice but to go along with U.S.-led talks.Ukrainians respond: People in Ukraine expressed a mix of fear and hope over the prospect of a peace process with Russia. Some soldiers on the front lines said the mere suggestion of talks that might cost Ukraine sovereignty was “too painful” to consider.Next steps: Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that reciprocal visits with Mr. Putin were likely and that Saudi Arabia might host the talks. The Kremlin’s spokesman said Thursday that Russia believed a meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump should take place “fairly quickly,” but that it was too soon to discuss dates.Reporting was contributed by Anton Troianovski, Andrew E. Kramer, Maria Varenikova and Hank Sanders.In a call Thursday with Ukraine’s foreign minister, Secretary of State Marco Rubio “underscored U.S. commitment to Ukrainian independence,” the State Department said, a message that may comfort Ukrainian and European officials alarmed about President Trump’s vision for a Ukraine-Russia peace agreement. Rubio talked to his Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, a day after Trump spoke with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, in what Trump characterized as the beginning of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. A description of the call with Putin that Trump posted on social media said the war “must end,” but made no assurances about Ukraine’s fate. Rubio and Sybiha “discussed the need for bold diplomacy to end the war in a negotiated manner leading to a sustainable peace,” an official State Department readout said, adding that Rubio also emphasized “the importance of the stability of Ukraine and the region.”NATO allies emphasize unity even as concerns mount that they could be left out of Ukraine talks.ImageThe U.S. defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on Thursday.Credit...Simon Wohlfahrt/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesEven as Europeans sought to display a united front in their support of Ukraine at a meeting of defense ministers in Brussels on Thursday, concerns are mounting that they could be left out in the cold by a Trump administration push to work with Russia to end the war.European leaders and top officials have insisted that Ukraine must have a seat at the table as peace plans are drawn and that the process should not be rushed because that could leave the embattled nation in a place of weakness during negotiations.But there has been a growing concern among NATO allies that the United States will take a different approach — even as it is prodding Europeans to shoulder more of the bill for whatever peace plan comes to pass.President Trump announced on Wednesday that he had a “lengthy and highly productive phone call” with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. He characterized it as the beginning of a negotiation to end the war in Ukraine without mentioning a role for Europe or Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, with whom he had a call as well. That, paired with comments from Mr. Trump and his defense secretary painting key Ukrainian goals as unrealistic, has helped to stoke fears that the United States could fail to take European concerns into account in its push for an end to the conflict.“There will be no credible and successful negotiations, no lasting peace, without Ukraine and without the E.U.,” said Antonio Costa, the president of the European Council, part of the European Union’s government.“Peace cannot be a simple cease-fire,” Mr. Costa wrote in a social media post on Thursday afternoon, and “Russia must no longer be a threat to Ukraine, to Europe, to international security.”Leaders at the NATO meeting pushed back on the idea that Ukraine and European allies were being left out of the process.“We are intensely consulting amongst each other, including with the United States,” Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary general, said during a news conference in Brussels on Thursday afternoon following the meeting. “What we did the last 24 hours was also very much about getting to the same page.”Mr. Rutte emphasized the NATO meeting’s areas of agreement for the United States and Europe: European spending on defense is already ramping up, he said, in line with President Trump’s demands; Ukraine’s allies are dedicated to bringing the country a durable peace; and defense production must be increased.ImageSoldiers from special forces units in the Bulgarian and Spanish armies participating in a NATO military exercise in Bulgaria on Thursday.Credit...Stoyan Nenov/ReutersThe U.S. defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, said that the discussions about Ukraine needed more “realism” but that the Trump administration’s tough talk was a reaction to the “realities on the ground,” rather than a concession to Mr. Putin.“Any suggestion that President Trump is doing anything other than negotiating from a position of strength is, on its face, ahistorical and false,” Mr. Hegseth said, speaking at a news conference following the NATO meeting.Mr. Rutte, asked about the risk that peace talks pursued now would be too hasty, said: “Even if talks start, they will not end on Day 1 or Day 2.”Both Mr. Hegseth and Mr. Rutte stressed that Mr. Trump spoke to President Zelensky of Ukraine shortly after his call with Mr. Putin on Wednesday.Mr. Zelensky wrote on social media after the call with Mr. Trump that the two were “charting our next steps to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace. As President Trump said, ‘Let’s get it done.’”The European leaders are walking a challenging line, seeking to remain active partners in the quest for peace in Ukraine while dealing with the reality of Russian aggression. They are trying to give the United States signs that they are doing what Mr. Trump has asked — like spending more on defense — as they push to keep a place at the negotiating table for themselves and for Ukraine.John Healey, Britain’s defense secretary, said after the NATO meeting, “My message in these discussions will be that there can be no negotiation about Ukraine without Ukraine, and Ukraine’s voice must be at the heart of any talks.”ImageMark Rutte, the NATO secretary general, right, met with Ukraine’s defense minister, Rustem Umerov, on Thursday in Brussels.Credit...Simon Wohlfahrt/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMr. Hegseth repeatedly emphasized that Mr. Trump was also a businessman and a deal maker and as such would be able to force some sort of solution. When asked at his news conference in Brussels if he could guarantee that Ukraine would not be left out of talks, and whether Europe would be involved, Mr. Hegseth said, “That’s not ultimately my decision.”He added that any negotiations would be pursued with “both” Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky. And he reiterated Mr. Trump’s stance that while European nations and NATO allies needed to spend more on their own defense, the White House stood behind the alliance.At the White House in the afternoon, Mr. Trump, asked by a reporter about whether Ukraine would be part of the negotiations with Russia, replied: “Of course they would. I mean, they’re part of it. We would have Ukraine, we would have Russia and we would have other people involved, too.”Mr. Hegseth said that Mr. Trump wanted to “make NATO great again,” and that “anyone that suggests its abandonment are trying to drive a wedge between allies that does not exist.”Notably, Mr. Hegseth said that Mr. Putin “took aggression” on Ukraine, something he omitted in speaking of the conflict to the Pentagon’s work force on Feb. 7, two weeks after being sworn in as defense secretary.Mr. Hegseth also touched on a comment he made Wednesday at the opening of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, an alliance of more than 40 NATO and non-NATO countries, in which he called one of Ukraine’s central demands — a return to its pre-2014 borders — “an unrealistic objective.” The comment appeared to signal a willingness, even before negotiations began, to allow Russia to claim areas its forces seized and occupied in the last decade: first Crimea and then the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. He said that the comment was “simply pointing out realism.”Mr. Hegseth said the United States would continue to send Kyiv military aid that had already been allocated under the Biden administration but signaled that Mr. Trump would use the possibility of additional aid as a negotiating tool.“I think it would be fair to say that things like future funding, either less or more, could be on the table in negotiations as well,” he explained, adding that it would be “whatever the president determines is the most robust carrot or stick on either side to induce a durable peace.”ImageA Ukrainian artillery unit fighting with Russian soldiers in October. Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesAccording to data compiled by The New York Times, the United States has provided Ukraine $67 billion in aid since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February of 2022, roughly half in shipments of weaponry from the Pentagon’s existing stockpile and half in funds to allow Ukraine to buy military hardware directly from the U.S. defense industry.Throughout the Biden administration, the average time between shipments from the Pentagon stockpiles was two weeks, even taking into account a 76-day halt in aid forced by House Speaker Mike Johnson between December 2023 and March 2024. The average time between announcements of funding aid under President Biden was 44 days. But the last of any U.S. aid to Ukraine was announced 35 days ago, before Mr. Trump took office.Hank Sanders and Megan Specia contributed reporting.President Trump told reporters that he would “love to have” Russia back in the Group of 7 nations and called it “a mistake to throw them out.” When one reporter pointed out that Russia had been removed after it annexed Crimea — claiming Ukrainian territory in a move seen as illegitimate in the West — Trump said that the annexation happened under President Barack Obama and that Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine happened under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “The only one that didn’t give them anything was Trump,” he said.When asked about President Volodymyr Zelensky’s call to ensure Ukraine has a seat at the negotiating table with Russia, President Trump said: “Of course they would. I mean, they’re part of it. We would have Ukraine, we would have Russia and we would have other people involved, too.”ImageCredit...Eric Lee/The New York TimesPresident Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he didn’t think Russia would let Ukraine join NATO and he blamed former President Joseph R. Biden for suggesting that could happen. He added that he believed President Vladimir Putin wanted peace in Ukraine, saying, “I think he would tell me if he didn’t.” When asked by a reporter if he trusted Putin, Trump said, “I trust him on this subject.”Slovakia’s leader welcomes Trump’s outreach to broker peace in the Russia-Ukraine war.ImagePrime Minister Robert Fico of Slovakia said “war hawks” in the European Union have “pushed Ukraine more and more into the slaughterhouse.”Credit...Radovan Stoklasa/ReutersRobert Fico, Slovakia’s prime minister and a longtime critic of Western support for Ukraine, on Thursday welcomed President Trump’s moves to broker peace talks, lamenting that Europe had “only blindly copied the Biden administration” in trying to weaken Russia.Mr. Fico, who visited Moscow in December for talks with President Vladimir V. Putin — a trip that dismayed most of Slovakia’s fellow member states of the European Union — gloated that the phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin that appeared to herald the start of talks on ending the conflict in Ukraine had vindicated his own outspoken opposition to the “war hawks in the E.U.”They had, he said, “pushed Ukraine more and more into the slaughterhouse.”Calculating the scale of the casualties since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has been difficult because the information is a state secret in both countries. But while Russia is believed to have lost about twice as many combatants to death and serious injury as Ukraine, Kyiv is still seen by experts to be losing ground in the war.Mr. Fico compared the conflict to a doubles tennis match with Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump on one side and Ukraine and Europe on the other, declaring that the American-Russian pair “will win convincingly.”He added in a post on social media: “It makes me sad now to see how clueless we are in the E.U.”President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Thursday that he had warned world leaders against trusting the Russian leader’s claims of being ready to end the war. “I emphasized that Ukraine must negotiate from a position of strength,” Zelensky wrote on social media.He added that in talks with Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland he had stressed “that no negotiations with Putin can begin without a united position from Ukraine, Europe and the U.S.”Mr. Tusk on Thursday avoided direct criticism of Mr. Trump’s outreach to Mr. Putin but called for “unity against threats from the East,” an oblique swipe at the go-it-alone approach of the United States. “Poland, Europe and the entire West need full cooperation and solidarity today,” he said in a statement on social media.Slovakia — a small country with little economic, diplomatic or military heft — has minimal influence on European Union policies and has stood largely alone, along with Hungary, in regularly denouncing Europe’s military aid to Ukraine.But, noting that “nobody is calling the E.U.” to ask what it thinks, he predicted that what he and Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, called the “peace camp” would have the upper hand after the Trump-Putin phone call on Wednesday.“The E.U. will have to quickly wake up from the military madness,” Mr. Fico said.Can Britain avoid a rift with Trump over Ukraine?ImagePrime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain has joined other European leaders in demanding a place at the table for Ukraine on talks to end the war with Russia.Credit...Carl Court/Getty ImagesFor Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, the news that the United States and Russia plan to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine confronts him with a diplomatic dilemma — one that could buffet his relationship with President Trump.Mr. Starmer’s first move, after the confirmation of a phone call between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, was to join other European leaders in demanding a place at the table for Ukraine, as well as for Europe.“We must make sure Ukraine is at the heart” of any settlement talks, Mr. Starmer said on Thursday, adding that it was vital for the country to be “in the strongest possible position,” either for more fighting or a peace negotiation.But Mr. Starmer will weigh his support for Ukraine against his determination to cultivate a friendly relationship with Mr. Trump. And Mr. Trump has other leverage if he concludes that Mr. Starmer is an obstacle to his plans for Ukraine, including his threat to impose economically damaging tariffs on Britain.The British government had hoped to steer clear of the tariffs amid signs that Mr. Trump was amenable to cutting some kind of deal with Mr. Starmer, even as he warned about his plans to press ahead with tariffs on the European Union.Unlike other European leaders, who could face the pain of American tariffs regardless of their response to Mr. Trump, Mr. Starmer may face a genuine choice: back him over Europe on Ukraine and potentially be exempt from the tariffs, or stand with Europe and Ukraine, and risk incurring his wrath.Britain is not likely to abandon its support for Ukraine easily. Since the Russia invasion in 2022, it has prided itself on being among the most forward-leaning Western powers in backing Ukraine’s military. Support for Ukraine crosses the political spectrum, with the Labour government picking up with aid where its Conservative predecessor left off.Last month, Mr. Starmer signed what Britain called a 100-year defense agreement with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. That will provide 3 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) a year in aid for the foreseeable future.But Ukraine now has the potential to complicate Britain’s relationship with its most important ally, the United States. Mr. Starmer has worked hard to cultivate Mr. Trump since they met for dinner at Trump Tower in New York last September.“We’ve seen the calls from President Trump overnight, and we all want to see a durable peace and no return to conflict and aggression,” Britain’s defense secretary, John Healey, said on Thursday at a meeting of NATO ministers in Brussels. But he added, “Let’s not forget, Russia remains a threat well beyond Ukraine.”President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said he had warned world leaders against trusting claims of “readiness to end the war” from the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin. “I emphasized that Ukraine must negotiate from a position of strength,” Zelensky wrote on social media, “with strong and reliable security guarantees, and that NATO membership would be the most cost-effective for partners. Another key guarantee is serious investment in Ukraine’s defense industry.” The post also said that Zelensky had discussed with Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland “the conditions needed for a lasting and real peace in Ukraine and agreed that no negotiations with Putin can begin without a united position from Ukraine, Europe and the U.S.”Taking questions at a news conference after a NATO defense ministers’ meeting in Brussels, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the United States remained committed to NATO but wanted other allies to spend more on defense. “We have not said in any way that we’re abandoning our allies in Europe,” he said, adding that “there have been no decisions” on troop levels.VideoCreditCredit...ReutersCease-fire talks could upend Ukraine’s domestic politics.ImageA former Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, is a political opponent of the current president, Volodymyr Zelensky.Credit...Pool photo by Johannes SimonIn one of his first moves since the Trump administration announced talks with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky imposed sanctions on a main domestic political rival, former President Petro Poroshenko.The legal action against a political opponent, which was included in a decree published on Thursday, highlighted how any cease-fire talks were expected to send tremors through domestic politics in Ukraine.President Trump characterized his lengthy phone call on Wednesday with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as the start of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. He did not mention any role for Mr. Zelensky, raising concerns that the Ukrainian leader — and Ukrainian interests — might be sidelined. Kyiv and its European allies have insisted that Ukraine have representation in any talks.Unlike Mr. Putin, Mr. Zelensky would have to navigate negotiations in a democratic system where opponents are likely to criticize him for any concessions. That is a vulnerability Russia has seized on.Russia is pushing for a three-stage negotiating format, according to Ukrainian officials and a person who has had recent conversations about settlement scenarios with senior Russian officials: an initial truce and preliminary deal, followed by elections in Ukraine, followed by the signing of a binding peace settlement. The person requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the discussions.President Trump has echoed the demand for an election in Ukraine. In comments late Wednesday, he noted that Mr. Zelensky’s approval ratings were “not great” and said that, “at some point you need to have elections.”Elections are suspended in Ukraine under martial law that was imposed on the first day of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Mr. Zelensky’s term, which would have expired last May, was also extended under that law.One Ukrainian political analyst argued that Mr. Putin’s demand that Ukraine hold elections — in hopes of installing a more pro-Russian government — would not succeed. “Ukrainians often vote against Putin’s wishes,” said Mykola Davydiuk, the analyst.Still, the prospect of a cease-fire followed by elections has animated the Ukrainian opposition that had, publicly and with few open disagreements, supported Mr. Zelensky as a wartime leader. Elections would risk reviving fierce internal divisions that had characterized Ukrainian politics before the Russia’s all-out invasion, and could undermine the war effort.But opponents have said that, far beyond what would be justified to thwart any Russian meddling in Ukrainian politics, Mr. Zelensky is abusing wartime powers for political gain — risking the country’s democracy and prospects for European integration. “For us, it’s crucially important to keep national unity,” Volodymyr Ariev, a member of Mr. Poroshenko’s European Solidarity political party, said in an interview. “Instead, there is persecution of opponents” by Mr. Zelensky. “We have no choice now but again to fight internally for democracy, to stand strong and maintain our European future,” he added.In an address to Ukrainians on Wednesday night, Mr. Zelensky said the country’s National Security and Defense Council would be imposing measures against “everyone who undermined Ukraine’s national security and helped Russia,” without specifically naming Mr. Poroshenko. He said those people had enriched themselves by “selling out Ukraine.” Mr. Zelensky made the accusation of collaboration with Russia without providing any evidence. Before the full-scale invasion, Mr. Poroshenko was widely seen in Ukrainian politics as more staunchly anti-Russian than Mr. Zelensky, who had run in 2019 on a promise to negotiate a peace with Mr. Putin. Critics, including Mr. Poroshenko, called that ambition naïve, and concessions offered by Mr. Zelensky did not prevent Russia’s 2022 invasion. The decree published on Thursday imposed sanctions on half a dozen wealthy Ukrainian businessmen, along with Mr. Poroshenko. The move will strip the former president of state awards, freeze assets and prohibit economic activity such as trading in stocks.Mr. Poroshenko is a businessman and owner of a large confectionary company. He and his allies said Thursday the sanctions were intended to sideline him politically after Mr. Trump’s announcement on Wednesday.Maria Varenikova contributed reporting.In a reminder of the daily toll of the war in Ukraine, Russia dropped two bombs on Thursday on the city of Kramatorsk, in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk, according to the Ukrainian prosecutor’s office. The bombs killed a 46-year-old man and wounded five other people, the prosecutor said. More than 10,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country nearly three years ago.ImageCredit...Genya Savilov/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesHegseth concluded his prepared remarks at the news conference by emphasizing that Europe needed to shoulder more of the burden of defense spending. “President Trump will not allow anyone to turn Uncle Sam into Uncle Sucker,” Hegseth said. Pete Hegseth, the U.S. secretary of defense, said that allies must “make NATO great again,” in part by ramping up defense spending. Speaking at a news conference following the conclusion of a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, he also took a shot at a comment European leaders commonly make about prioritizing their values. “Values are important, but you can’t shoot values,” he said.ImageCredit...Yves Herman/ReutersNATO’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, just wrapped up a news conference after the meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels. He emphasized the issues on which NATO allies agree — that Europe should spend more on defense, that military production should ramp up and that Ukraine needed a sustainable peace. But he was repeatedly asked about whether Ukraine and Europe were likely to be left on the sidelines as President Trump and Russia negotiate. “We are closely coordinating,” he insisted. The push for talks on Ukraine comes as Russia’s battlefield advances have slowed.ImageRussian soldiers battle to reclaim all of the Kursk region from the Ukrainian Army in December.Credit...Nanna Heitmann for The New York TimesImageWounded soldiers at a medical center outside of Kursk, Russia, in November.Credit...Nanna Heitmann for The New York TimesImageA Ukrainian civilian in the embattled city of Myrnohrad, Ukraine, in November.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesPresident Trump’s decision on Wednesday to “start negotiations immediately” over ending the war in Ukraine came at a time of dwindling prospects for a military resolution of the conflict.The pace of Russia’s multipronged offensive across eastern Ukraine has been dropping since November, with the Kremlin’s forces occupying just 19 additional square miles so far this month, according to Deep State, a group that analyzes combat videos and has close links to the Ukrainian army. The Russian military is also struggling to dislodge Ukrainian soldiers from a sliver of Russian territory in the western Kursk region, despite committing tens of thousands of fighters to the campaign.Ukraine has been able to slow the enemy advance by committing some of its limited reserves to counterattacks in Kursk and around the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk in recent weeks.These operations have also aimed to show the Trump administration and other Western allies that Ukraine’s smaller military is still capable of taking the initiative on the battlefield and staying in the fight. Few analysts, however, believe Kyiv will be able to achieve its official goal of recovering all land lost to Russia since 2014. On Wednesday, the U.S. defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, called that goal “unrealistic.”Russia and Ukraine are both struggling to replace soldiers that have been killed or injured on the battlefield. Both sides are incurring those losses at one of the fastest paces since Russia’s full-scale invasion three years ago.The Russian government has been forced to offer ever-growing bonuses and salaries to attract new recruits, a financial spiral that is contributing to destabilizing the Russian economy. Ukraine, for its part, is resorting to ever more draconian mobilization tactics to make up for the decline in volunteers.ImageA destroyed Ukrainian tank, a few miles from the border with Russia’s Kursk region in January.Credit...Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York TimesThe reasons for the slowdown of the Russian advance are not clear. Some analysts attribute it to an operational pause, with the Russian military taking advantage of bad weather to replenish units and prepare for a new push, perhaps in a new area.A new offensive could come even while peace talks are underway.“We should expect the Russian Army to renew offensive operations after it regroups,” said Dmitri Kuznets, a military analyst at Meduza, an independent Russian media outlet.Other analysts see signs of structural exhaustion. They believe the Russian military is running out of troops and equipment to sustain its highly costly tactic of overwhelming Ukrainian defenses with constant attacks by small groups of soldiers over exposed terrain.These analysts believe that repeating last year’s scale of offensive operations would require Russia to draft more troops, a politically risky option that President Vladimir V. Putin is prepared for, but would rather avoid.Regardless of the reasons for the slowdown, Mr. Putin’s ability to end the war by forcing Ukraine to capitulate remains as distant as ever. Even at last year’s fastest pace of advance, it would take the Russian forces years merely to conquer the four Ukrainian regions that the Kremlin has proclaimed to be part of its territory.This makes the timing of Mr. Trump’s negotiation offer particularly attractive to Mr. Putin. He has long signaled that he wanted to reach a deal on Ukraine directly with the United States, which he views as the ultimate decision maker in Kyiv. Mr. Trump’s apparent willingness to bypass Kyiv and deal directly with Mr. Putin could provide the Russian leader with a diplomatic victory at a time when the battlefield remains deadlocked.Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary general, addressed the Trump administration’s pressure on Europe to shoulder more of a defense burden and reiterated his own call for more European military spending. “We all agree that we need to put Ukraine in the best possible position for negotiations, and we need a durable and lasting peace,” he told a news conference after the meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels.ImageCredit...Simon Wohlfahrt/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesHe also said that “allies took note of President Trump’s initiative for peace talks.” When asked if there was a risk that Ukraine was going to be rushed into talks in a way that would leave it negotiating from a place of weakness, Rutte said that “even if talks start, they will not end on day one or day two.”President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said it was vital that his country be included in any negotiations to end the war. “We, as a sovereign country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us,” he told journalists in Ukraine, a day after Trump spoke to Putin about ending the war. VideoEuropeans also “must be at the table for talks,” he added. While Zelensky acknowledged that it was “unpleasant” that Trump had spoken to Putin before him, he said he did not think that reflected U.S. priorities.To some Ukrainian soldiers, the prospect of cease-fire talks is ‘too painful.’ImageUkrainian soldiers in the Donetsk region of Ukraine last year.Credit...Nicole Tung for The New York TimesHoled up in a small wooden house on a side road, the Ukrainian battalion commander had two concerns on his mind: Russian assaults at the front a dozen miles away and President Trump’s flurry of statements about ending the war quickly.The commander, Lt. Col. Vadim Balyuk of the special forces assault battalion in Ukraine’s 59th Brigade, had followed Wednesday’s calls between Mr. Trump and his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts — talks the American leader framed as the start of peace negotiations. Now, as he defends against Russian assaults in the eastern Donetsk region, he says he is worried about what it all means for Ukraine.“If we stop the fighting right now, it will give Trump the opportunity to stop the flow of weapons and ammunition to us” and leave Ukraine vulnerable to another invasion, Colonel Balyuk said. “This will allow Putin to build up his army — and in two years, he could take over Ukraine very easily.”Recent statements from Mr. Trump and his administration — dismissing Ukraine’s desire for NATO membership and full territorial restoration as unrealistic — have left Ukrainian soldiers fearing that their country’s interests will be sidelined in any peace negotiations.For the past year, soldiers on this stretch of the front, just west of the embattled city of Pokrovsk, have been steadily pushed back by Russian forces. Moscow’s troops are now just miles from crossing into the nearby Dnipropetrovsk region; if that happens, it would be the first time they have advanced there since Mr. Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago.Speaking from a cafe in the small town of Mezhova, just west of Pokrovsk, another soldier said that the suggestion of negotiations now was a “pretty difficult” topic given all the sacrifices Ukraine has made to defend its sovereignty.“Even if we realize that we’re exhausted, that we lost a lot of friends, we cannot talk with a terrorist state,” the soldier, a 27-year-old reconnaissance officer, said, referring to Russia. “It’s just too painful.”The soldier, who identified himself by the call sign Kocubaka according to military protocol, said that he viewed Mr. Trump’s recent push for negotiations as an effort to fulfill his campaign promise to end the war in 24 hours. But, like many others, he feared that rushed talks could sideline Ukraine.Ukrainian soldiers also worry that their country’s European allies, weakened by internal divisions and slow to bolster investments in their military, won’t have the clout to steer the talks and safeguard Ukraine’s interests. The initial response from European officials to Mr. Trump’s involvement has been to quickly declare that Ukraine should be involved in any settlement talks. Kocubaka said, “For the military, it’s been like this since the start of the war. We know that in the end, it will only be us fighting for our freedom, for our independence.”He added, “We’ll keep fighting, because there is no other choice.”Ukraine’s borders are crucial in any peace talks.The question of where Ukraine’s borders with Russia should be drawn in any peace negotiations came into sharp focus this week after Pete Hegseth, the U.S. defense secretary, said that it was “unrealistic” for Ukraine to try to regain all of the territory Russia has seized since 2014.Ukraine’s government has long said that its goal is to restore its borders to where they were before Russia launched its first invasion more than a decade ago.Here is a look at Ukraine’s borders and Russia’s advances into its territory:Independence bordersUkraine’s borders were set when it gained independence in 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed. It borders Belarus to the north; Poland, Slovakia and Hungary to the west; and Romania and Moldova to the south. It also borders its giant neighbor Russia to the east. 2014 invasion and Crimea annexationRussian forces invaded Ukraine in 2014, seizing Crimea, a peninsula extending from its southern coast. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia annexed the territory, a move that is not recognized internationally. Ukraine’s government has said that reclaiming Crimea, by force or diplomacy, is one of its most important goals in the war. In 2018, Russia opened a bridge across the Kerch Strait linking its territory with Crimea. Ukraine has bombed the bridge on several occasions.Military experts have long said that winning back Crimea by force is not a realistic option for Ukraine, given Russia’s military strength. Ukrainian forces have made little headway in opening a route toward Crimea.In the 2014 invasion, Russian forces and proxy militias also seized territory in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, including the capitals of the two provinces it comprises, Donetsk and Luhansk. Moscow has held those cities and much of the surrounding areas ever since.Full-scale invasionThe Kremlin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russian forces failed in their goal of seizing the capital, Kyiv, but they did capture more territory in Donetsk and Luhansk, including the cities of Mariupol and Bakhmut. Russia also won ground in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in southern Ukraine, in effect gaining control of a land corridor along the northern coast of the Sea of Azov. That connected Russian forces in Crimea with territory they controlled in eastern Ukraine.In the fall of 2022, Moscow illegally annexed Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk, just as it had done with Crimea, although it did not control the entirety of those provinces. Over the past year, the fiercest fighting in Ukraine has taken place in Donetsk, where Russian forces have gained control of several cities and towns.Russia now controls around 20 percent of Ukraine’s territory, including areas in the south and east, Crimea and some ground north of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city.Russian markets soar after the Trump-Putin call.ImageMoscow on Thursday, where Russia’s main stock index rose to levels not seen since last summer.Credit...Maxim Shemetov/ReutersRussian markets skyrocketed, the ruble jumped and business leaders in Moscow rejoiced after a call on Wednesday between President Trump and President Putin raised hopes that some sanctions could be eased.Russia’s main stock index rose more than 5 percent after the market opened on Thursday, reaching levels not seen since last summer. The ruble gained more than 3 percent against the dollar, reversing some of the losses it had suffered since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly three years ago.“Russian asset prices and the ruble have flourished today,” said Oleg Kouzmin, chief economist at Renaissance Capital, an investment bank in Moscow. “Market reaction reflects hopes for a breakthrough in restoring the political dialogue between Russia and the U.S. and an associated easing in geopolitical tensions.”However strong, Russia’s economic joy might be short-lived. Although Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump did discuss “economic relations between Russia and the United States,” according to the Kremlin’s readout of their call, Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said on Thursday that the two leaders did not talk about the lifting of sanctions.“The market rejoiced as if everything was over, although the settlement was still in its initial phase,” wrote Spydell Finance, a Russian market research channel on Telegram, a social messaging app.Russian economic policymakers have managed to weather the initial storm caused by sanctions and the country’s ballooning war budget, including by making sure Moscow could sell its oil and gas to China, India, and Turkey. Russian businesses proved nimble at replacing many goods that were delivered by Western companies.As a result, Russia’s economy expanded about 4 percent annually in 2023 and 2024. But economists warned that the country’s wartime overdrive growth was finite, pointing to the rising prices that forced the country’s central bank to raise the benchmark interest rate to 21 percent. That, in turn, made loans prohibitively expensive to businesses, putting pressure on growth.A strengthened ruble could ease these concerns, economists said, by making imports cheaper and therefore lowering the rate of inflation, which hit 9.5 percent in 2024 and continued to grow this year.“Investors have dreamed about such a scenario,” Ovanes Oganisyan, a Russian investment analyst told Kommersant, the country’s business news outlet. “But they didn’t quite believe that this was possible.”Still, economic conditions will continue to improve only if more progress is made in settling the conflict in Ukraine, experts said.Successful peace talks may lower economic uncertainty and the restoration of natural gas exports, said Mr. Kouzmin, the economist. “The major risk is that current hopes don’t turn into reality and the market would get disappointed,” he added.Trump’s envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, will travel to Germany and Ukraine in the coming days, according to the State Department. It said Kellogg would “engage with allies and partners across Europe who are willing to work with the United States to end Russia’s war against Ukraine.”Following his call with Putin, Trump did not include Kellogg’s name in a post about his negotiating team. That had raised questions about whether Kellogg was still playing a role in the Trump administration’s Ukraine policy.Ukrainians say they want the war to end, but worry about an unjust peace.ImageUkrainians gathering at the site of a Russian missile strike in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Wednesday.Credit...Sergey Dolzhenko/EPA, via ShutterstockUkrainians on Thursday expressed a mixture of fear and hope over the prospect of a peace process with Russia, with some expressing disappointment in the United States for pursuing talks with Russia that did not, at least for now, include Ukraine.After three years of grinding war, exhaustion has set in. Ukrainians are tired, but also aware of the price paid for defending their country — hundreds of thousands of people killed and wounded, towns and villages shattered, countless homes destroyed. While Ukrainians want the fighting to end, many said in interviews in the capital, Kyiv, that they want any peace to be just.Particularly worrisome, to some, were the comments by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday that it was “unrealistic” for Ukraine to expect a peace deal that would restore its borders to what they were in 2014, before Russia annexed Crimea. It was a clear signal from the Trump administration that it expected Ukraine to cede territory to Russia, possibly including lands that Moscow has seized since its full-scale invasion in 2022.“The secretary of defense of the United States said yesterday we should not even dream of returning the occupied territories,” said Nikita Bezprozvannyi, 24, the director of an after-school program in Kyiv. “In my world — everyone I know, my friends and those fighting — we all do dream about it.”Others were concerned that the sacrifices made by the Ukrainian military would be squandered.Yaromyr Udod, 29, a project manager, said that in any peace talks, “Ukrainian sovereignty has to be respected,” and that he believed support from Kyiv’s allies was flagging.“I feel that the level of commitment to supporting Ukraine has dropped,” he said, adding that he was upset with the United States in particular. “It is such a sharp change in the United States’ policy, and their rhetoric is very unpleasant,” he said.On a foggy winter morning, the square in front of St. Michael’s Golden-Domed Monastery in the hilly center of Kyiv was filled with soldiers who had come to the cathedral for the funeral of yet another fallen comrade.Observing the funeral was Oleksandr Liubun, 63, a retiree who often walks his dog there. He lives in Lukianivka, a district of the capital that is often attacked by the Russian military, and said he wanted the strikes to stop. “I am scared that the war might continue,” Mr. Liubun said, adding: “I want it to be finally over.”Yulia Liubintsova, 41, the head of a ballet dancers union, expressed hope for peace negotiations, seeing talks as the only way for Ukraine to survive. “I understand that we will not return our territories as we have no people left to fight,” she said. “There are so much fewer of us, so much fewer, so only negotiations can help.”Others said Ukraine should keep fighting instead of accepting an unfair peace. Tetyana Tkachenko, 34, a bank employee, said: “Even if missiles are falling on my head, I want to resist till the end. There has to be justice.”Oleksandra Mykolyshyn and Nataliia Novosolova contributed reporting.Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary general, just spoke alongside the Ukrainian defense minister, Rustem Umerov, as defense ministers meet in Brussels.

The momentum on the main front of the war has favored Russia for more than a year.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was already facing a daunting week as foreign officials gathered in Europe for talks about his country’s future.The Trump administration was demanding $500 billion in Ukrainian mineral rights, it canceled Ukraine’s exemption from U.S. tariffs on steel and a leading American skeptic of military assistance for Kyiv, Vice President JD Vance, was on his way to Europe for a meeting with the Ukrainian leader.But on Wednesday, things went from bad to worse. President Trump’s defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, delivered a harsh assessment of Ukraine’s prospects in its war with Russia. Then Mr. Trump announced that he had spoken with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, a call Mr. Trump characterized as the opening of talks to end the war — with no clear role for Mr. Zelensky.The phone call also spelled the end of American efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago.“He’s on his heels geopolitically,” Cliff Kupchan, chairman of Eurasia Group, a risk analysis firm based in Washington, said of Mr. Zelensky.Mr. Trump’s actions in the last two days — which also included a prisoner swap with the Kremlin that freed an American teacher — signaled a thawing relationship between the United States and Russia that could favor Mr. Putin in a peace deal while leaving Ukraine on the sidelines.Mr. Trump also called the Ukrainian leader on Wednesday, but in a social media post he did not mention how, or if, Mr. Zelensky would figure in peace talks.Mr. Zelensky will meet with Mr. Vance and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, at the annual Munich Security Conference, which opens on Friday, Mr. Trump said.Negotiations to end the deadliest war in Europe in generations will shape the future of Ukraine, and the recent developments mean some of its territory is likely to remain under Russian occupation.And they will shape Mr. Zelensky’s political future. He has little choice but to go along with American-led talks despite his deep skepticism, shared by most Ukrainians, of Mr. Putin’s readiness to negotiate without imposing onerous conditions or bringing more military and economic pressure to bear.By Thursday morning, it was a sentiment swirling widely in Kyiv, a city now hit nightly with Russian missiles and exploding drones.Volodymyr Fesenko, a political analyst, wrote on Facebook that Mr. Putin was most likely playing the Trump administration for time. “He is not going to compromise on ending the war, as Trump’s team wants,” he wrote.ImagePresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine with Donald J. Trump in New York in September. Mr. Trump’s recent actions have signaled a warming relationship between the United States and Russia.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesMr. Trump wasn’t the only one to deliver sobering news to Ukraine. Mr. Hegseth told European allies on Wednesday that it was “unrealistic” for Ukraine to return to its borders as they were before Russia’s military invasion began in 2014.And he added that the United States did not support Ukraine’s goal of joining NATO to secure any peace settlement, calling it “unrealistic.”Mr. Zelensky has played weak hands well before. In the opening days of Russia’s invasion, he popped out of a bunker to film selfie videos that rallied his country, and much of the world, to Ukraine’s cause.Now he is again facing a pivotal moment for his country in a diminished position, sinking in domestic polls and getting a cold shoulder from his most important ally.Mr. Zelensky has twice said in recent days that he is willing to negotiate with Mr. Putin if Western allies offer security guarantees in a settlement. In his nightly address to the nation Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader was conciliatory, saying he had a “good and detailed discussion” with Mr. Trump.“We discussed many aspects — diplomatic, military, economic — and President Trump informed me of what Putin had told him,” he added. “We believe that America’s strength is sufficient to pressure Russia and Putin into peace, together with us, together with all our partners.”Mr. Putin, for his part, has signaled that Mr. Zelensky would need to face an election at home before Russia would accept his signature on a peace deal.The demand suggests a Russian view of a potential three-step process for negotiating a settlement to the war, according to a person who has had recent conversations about settlement scenarios with senior Russian officials. It envisions an initial truce and preliminary deal, followed by elections in Ukraine and only then a binding peace settlement, said the person, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.Ukraine has had some bright spots. Soon after his inauguration, Mr. Trump harshly criticized Mr. Putin, saying he was “destroying” Russia with the war.And while Mr. Trump’s claim on Ukraine’s minerals comes at a big cost for Kyiv, it has also been viewed by Ukrainian officials as a hopeful sign.The talks on mineral rights, which began on Wednesday with a visit to Kyiv by the American Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, open a path for Mr. Trump to continue military aid while claiming to have secured a benefit for the United States.ImageInside a titanium mine in Ukraine’s Zhytomyr region. President Trump has repeatedly pushed the idea of trading U.S. aid for Ukraine’s critical minerals.Credit...Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times“They’ve essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don’t feel stupid,” Mr. Trump said of Ukraine’s willingness to yield its natural resources, in an interview with Fox News that aired on Monday. “Otherwise, we’re stupid. I said to them, ‘We have to get something. We cannot continue to pay this money.’ ”That was before Russia and the United States showed a new willingness to work together. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump’s friend and envoy, Steve Witkoff, flew a private jet into Moscow to retrieve an imprisoned American teacher, Marc Fogel, a notable gesture of conciliation by Moscow. In return, the Kremlin said, the United States would deliver a Russian cybercriminal, Alexander Vinnik, back to Russia.Mr. Zelensky has rejected Mr. Putin’s repeated claims that he is an illegitimate leader, and that Ukraine needs to lift martial law and hold elections. (Ukrainian elections were delayed under martial law after Russia invaded in 2022. Mr. Zelensky’s five-year term, which would have expired last May, was extended under the law.)ImageKateryna Zakharuk visiting the grave of her husband, Ivan Zakharuk, a Ukrainian soldier, in the northern city of Sumy in January. The war so far is estimated to have killed and wounded about a million soldiers, counting both sides.Credit...Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York TimesUkrainian officials say they view the Russian demand for democratic elections as part of a ploy to destabilize the government and compel Ukraine to let its guard down for a vote. They have urged the Trump administration not to endorse the idea.“It is the Russians who are raising the topic of elections because they need their man in Ukraine,” Mr. Zelensky said in an interview with the British broadcaster ITV News that aired last weekend. “If we suspend martial law, we may lose the army. And the Russians will be happy because the qualities of spirit and combat capability will be lost.”Inside Ukraine, however, his domestic opponents are quietly preparing for a possible campaign.Despite his diminished status going into talks, it is too early to write off Mr. Zelensky, a former actor and an adept leader in a crisis, Mr. Kupchan, the Eurasia analyst, said.“He’s proven to be quite a skilled counterpuncher,” he said. “I don’t feel we’re in the final act of any play yet.”Mr. Zelensky is preparing for talks as the momentum on the main front of the war, in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, has favored Russia for more than a year. It is unclear for how long Russia can sustain extraordinarily high casualties, which have been estimated by military analysts as at least in the hundreds daily.ImageAnti-tank defenses known as dragon’s teeth in the Pokrovsk district of Ukraine in November.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesAnd Ukraine is entering talks with one bit of leverage: its control over a few hundred square miles of Russian territory in the Kursk region captured last summer, an incursion that was deeply embarrassing to the Kremlin. Mr. Zelensky said he wanted to trade territory in Kursk for Russian-held Ukrainian land, something Mr. Putin would almost certainly resist.If the momentum of a few dozen or hundreds of yards of advances per day continued through negotiations, it would give an advantage to Moscow. Then, any delay by Ukraine in accepting cease-fire terms would cost Kyiv territory.Russia’s progress has slowed since November in month-on-month measures of captured territory, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a U.S.-based analytical group.In January, for example, Russia captured about 40 fewer square miles than in December, the institute reported. Military analysts have cautioned that determining the significance of that decline is not possible.Anton Troianovski contributed reporting.",

But economists warned that the country’s wartime overdrive growth was finite, pointing to the rising prices that forced the country’s central bank to raise the benchmark interest rate to 21 percent. That, in turn, made loans prohibitively expensive to businesses, putting pressure on growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA strengthened ruble could ease these concerns, economists said, by making imports cheaper and therefore lowering the rate of inflation, which hit 9.5 percent in 2024 and continued to grow this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Investors have dreamed about such a scenario,” Ovanes Oganisyan, a Russian investment analyst told Kommersant, the country’s business news outlet. “But they didn’t quite believe that this was possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, economic conditions will continue to improve only if more progress is made in settling the conflict in Ukraine, experts said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuccessful peace talks may lower economic uncertainty and the restoration of natural gas exports, said Mr. Kouzmin, the economist. “The major risk is that current hopes don’t turn into reality and the market would get disappointed,” he added.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv role=\"article\" aria-posinset=\"6\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" aria-live=\"off\" aria-labelledby=\"post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNGJhYjFkN2ItNzFlNC01NDI2LThlNjQtYjNhNGUzM2Y3NWI3\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"4bab1d7b-71e4-5426-8e64-b3a4e33f75b7\" data-testid=\"reporter-update\" data-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/13/world/russia-ukraine-war-trump#4bab1d7b-71e4-5426-8e64-b3a4e33f75b7\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"live-blog-byline\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/by/cassandra-vinograd\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Cassandra Vinograd\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/03/reader-center/author-cassandra-vinograd/author-cassandra-vinograd-thumbLarge.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/03/reader-center/author-cassandra-vinograd/author-cassandra-vinograd-thumbStandard.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/03/reader-center/author-cassandra-vinograd/author-cassandra-vinograd-thumbLarge.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp 150w\" sizes=\"40px\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump’s envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, will travel to Germany and Ukraine in the coming days, according to the State Department.
