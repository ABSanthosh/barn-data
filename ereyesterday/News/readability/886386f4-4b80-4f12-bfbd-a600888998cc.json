It displayed instead the government’s lack of control over forces nominally under its command and its inability to police other armed groups, experts said.The outburst began when insurgents linked to the ousted Assad dictatorship attacked government forces on March 6 at different sites across two coastal provinces that are the heartland of Syria’s Alawite minority. The government responded with a broad mobilization of its security forces, which other armed groups and armed civilians joined, according to witnesses, human rights groups and analysts who tracked the violence.Groups of these fighters — some nominally under the government’s control and others outside of it — fanned out across Tartus and Latakia Provinces, killing suspected insurgents who oppose the new authorities, the rights groups said. But they also shelled residential neighborhoods, burned and looted homes and carried out sectarian-driven killings of Alawite civilians, according to the rights groups.The leaders of the new government and the fighters now in its security forces are overwhelmingly from Syria’s Sunni Muslim majority, while the civilian victims of this wave of violence were overwhelmingly Alawites, a minority sect linked to Shiite Islam. The Assad family is Alawite, and during its five decades ruling Syria, it often prioritized members of the minority community in security and military jobs, meaning that many Sunnis associate the Alawites with the old regime and its brutal attacks on their communities during the country’s 13-year civil war.ImageSyrians fleeing last week into Lebanon across the Nahr al-Kabir river, seeking refuge from violence in regions along Syria’s Mediterranean coast.Credit...Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York TimesThank you for your patience while we verify access.
