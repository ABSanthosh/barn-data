  "text": "The Israel Defense Forces on Saturday said it had taken over large stretches of territory in the southern Gaza Strip, encircling the city of Rafah and establishing a security corridor separating Rafah from the city of Khan Younis.“This is the last moment to remove Hamas, free all the hostages, and bring an end to the war,” Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement. \"Soon the IDF will intensify its operations across most of Gaza.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this month the IDF intended to establish a corridor between Rafah and Khan Younis, which he called the Morag Axis for a former Israeli settlement, to increase pressure on Hamas to release remaining hostages. Katz said Saturday that the takeover of Morag had been completed, “turning the entire area between the Philadelphi corridor and Morag into part of Israel’s security zone.”The government in Rafah said Saturday it “strongly rejects and firmly condemns” the declaration of a security zone that would encompass the entire territory of the Rafah Governorate.“This unilateral decision constitutes a blatant violation of international law and international legitimacy resolutions, which affirm the sanctity of the occupied Palestinian territories and the national rights of our people,” the government said in a statement.The government called Katz’s declaration “illegitimate.” Rafah, it said, “is an inseparable part of Palestinian land. It will remain so forever, deeply rooted in its people and steadfast in the face of all attempts at forced displacement and demographic change.”Katz said IDF operations would soon “expand with force to additional areas across most of Gaza.” The announcement came as Israel prepared for Passover, the Jewish holiday marking the exodus of their ancestors from slavery.“Now is the time to rise up, remove Hamas, and release all Israeli hostages — this is the only way to end the war,” Katz said. “Those interested will also be offered the option of voluntary relocation to other countries, in line with the vision of the U.S. President, which we are working to implement.”Here’s what else to know:The Israeli military warned residents of five neighborhoods in central Gaza to evacuate Saturday evening, saying it was striking the area in retaliation from alleged rocket fire.The Israeli military’s increasing evacuation orders “have resulted in the forcible transfer of Palestinians in Gaza into ever shrinking spaces where they have little or no access to lifesaving services … and where they continue to be subject to attacks,” a spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said Friday. According to the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, almost 400,000 people have been displaced since Israel broke its ceasefire with Hamas on March 18.The European Union and a number of nations including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Britain condemned Israel’s order to close eight schools run by UNRWA in East Jerusalem on social media platform X. According to a Friday update from U.N. humanitarian affairs agency OCHA, the orders issued earlier this week would come into effect in 30 days and impact about 800 children.At least 50,933 Palestinians have been killed and 116,045 injured in Gaza since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The ministry said that more than 1,500 have been killed since the breakdown of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas last month.",
