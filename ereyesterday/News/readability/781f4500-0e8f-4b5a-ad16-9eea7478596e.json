  "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia's war against his country will \"end sooner\" under US President-elect Donald Trump's administration. \"The war will end, but there is no exact date. Of course, with the policy of this team, which will now lead the White House, the war will end sooner,\" he told Ukraine's Suspilne broadcaster. Trump has said he'd seek a quick deal between Kyiv and Moscow. German Chancellor Scholz said in an interview published Friday that Trump privately held \"more nuanced position on Ukraine than is often assumed\". Scholz, who spoke with Trump by phone on Sunday, told the German Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily his call was \"a very detailed and good conversation\" about the situation in Ukraine. Asked whether Trump would make a deal over the head of the Ukrainians, Scholz said Trump gave \"no indication\" he would.",
