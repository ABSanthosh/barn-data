After street protests and other criticism, he said he would propose a new law restoring their independence.VideoThe protests in Kyiv erupted after the Ukrainian Parliament voted to toughen restrictions on two anticorruption agencies at the center of the government’s reform drive.CreditCredit...Brendan Hoffman for The New York TimesJuly 23, 2025Updated 5:29 p.m. ETFacing growing domestic pressure, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Wednesday said he would reverse course on his crackdown on the country’s independent anticorruption agencies.On Tuesday, he signed into law a bill giving Ukraine’s prosecutor general — who is appointed by the president — new power over the agencies, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and a specialized prosecutorial office that pursued its cases.In a video address on Wednesday, he said he would submit a new bill to Parliament to restore independence to the agencies, which were created after street protests in 2014 ushered in a pro-Western government.As Parliament went into recess on Wednesday, it was unclear when it would consider Mr. Zelensky’s proposal.It was a fast about-face to a series of events that has brought Mr. Zelensky some of the harshest criticism of his leadership since the start of the war with Russia. To his critics, the move to assert control over the agencies appeared to be an effort to shore up his grip on political power at a perilous moment for Ukraine as Russian troops continued to advance on the battlefield.Instead, the move touched off the first street protests against Mr. Zelensky’s administration in more than three years of the full-scale war, breaking a wartime taboo on open political opposition.It also prompted a rebuke from allies and apparently caused divisions within his government, all worrying signs for Ukraine just as Mr. Zelensky had smoothed relations with the Trump administration.After their creation, the two agencies became centerpieces of Ukrainians’ aspirations to rid their country of corruption and join the European Union. They were intended partly to safeguard foreign aid and were strongly backed by countries providing financial assistance to Ukraine and by the International Monetary Fund.ImageThousands of people gather in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv to protest moves by President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government to weaken anticorruption institutions, on Wednesday.Credit...Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York TimesRecently, the agencies have been looking into people in Mr. Zelensky’s circle. On Monday, the country’s security services raided the agencies’ offices, saying they had been infiltrated by Russian intelligence. The security services also searched homes of investigators, accusing several of having ties to Russia.Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Zelensky defended the law, saying additional control over the agencies was necessary for removing “Russian influence” from them. Critics say little plausible evidence of Russian infiltration has been made public.“The anticorruption infrastructure will continue to work, only without Russian influence,” Mr. Zelensky said. “That must be cleansed.”But the result of these moves has been some of the harshest criticism of Mr. Zelensky’s leadership since the start of the war.“Now is the moment when martial law and unfortunately the realities of the war are being abused by Zelensky to monopolize his power,” said Daria Kaleniuk, a prominent anticorruption activist, in a telephone interview. The goal, she said, was to “silence those who criticize him, dismantle anticorruption institutions and marginalize political opponents.”Several thousand protesters gathered late on Tuesday in Kyiv and other cities, despite risks of missile attacks, to protest the new law, many waving signs hastily written on pieces of cardboard. Dmytro Koziatynsky, a war veteran who organized the protests, called on Ukrainians to come out again on Wednesday evening. “This is not what I fought for,” he said in an interview.ImagePresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is facing growing pressure over a new law to curtail agencies that fight graft.Credit...Antonio Masiello/Getty ImagesDespite Mr. Zelensky’s promise of a policy reversal, thousands of protesters turned out Wednesday evening on a street near his presidential office.His critics say the president had already overstepped his authority under the martial law imposed since the Russian invasion, including by investigating or imposing financial restrictions on media organizations, nongovernmental groups and opposition politicians.The weakening of the anticorruption agencies was the latest in a string of steps he has taken to consolidate his power, they say. The agencies had been investigating senior members of his government, including a deputy prime minister, Oleksiy Chernyshov, who was charged with corruption on June 23 after being accused of taking kickbacks in a real estate deal.Cracks appeared in his administration over the issue. The director of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, one of the most senior security officials in Ukraine’s wartime leadership, posted a rare statement on domestic policy that notably did not endorse Mr. Zelensky’s move.The statement, posted on Facebook on Tuesday, did not directly condemn the law, but General Budanov called for Ukraine to maintain strong “institutions,” particularly during the war. “I am certain that strong armed forces and institutions will save Ukraine,” he wrote. He also called for unity.In comments that contrasted with General Budanov’s cryptic comments, Vasyl Malyuk, the head of the domestic intelligence agency, voiced his support for the new law in comments to Ukrainian journalists on Tuesday.Mr. Malyuk characterized the independent agencies as having been unconstitutional. “Under the constitution, there can be only one general prosecutor in the country,” he said.In a show of unity, Mr. Zelensky on Wednesday met with the heads of the agencies and top law-enforcement officials, saying the gathering showed commitment to the new approach across the government. “Everybody will work together and on a political level we will support this,” Mr. Zelensky said.But after the meeting, the heads of the two formerly independent agencies issued a joint statement saying they could no longer effectively investigate top-level corruption, suggesting they did not see the matter as resolved.ImageProtesting in Kyiv on Wednesday night.Credit...Brendan Hoffman for The New York TimesUkraine’s main Western military backers and financial supporters in the Group of 7 issued a statement expressing concerns about the law.“We all have a shared commitment to support transparency, independent institutions, and good governance, and we value our partnerships in Ukraine to combat corruption together,” the statement on X said.European leaders have pledged military and financial support to fill gaps left by the Trump administration, leaving little room for Europe or the United States to withhold funding to protest backsliding on corruption without risking Ukraine’s loss in the war, analysts have said.President Trump has a tense personal history with the Ukrainian agencies, which, analysts in Kyiv said, may have led Mr. Zelensky to believe his administration would not object to stripping their independence.During Mr. Trump’s first term, the same agencies had drawn sharp criticism from Mr. Trump’s supporters, who accused the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of aiding the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.Oleksandr Chubko contributed reporting from Kyiv.Andrew E.
