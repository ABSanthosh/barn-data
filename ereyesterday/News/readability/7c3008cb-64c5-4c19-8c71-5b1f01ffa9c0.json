  "text": "Donald Trump (file photo)US President Donald Trump criticised the American judicial system on Monday, accusing courts—including the Supreme Court—of obstructing his efforts to deport undocumented immigrants, including what he described as “violent criminals and terrorists.”In a Truth Social post, Trump said, “I’m doing what I was elected to do, remove criminals from our Country, but the Courts don’t seem to want me to do that.” He said that while his team was doing an “incredible job,” they were being “stymied at every turn.”Trump specifically targeted the Supreme Court, stating it appeared reluctant to allow deportations to proceed. “They seemingly don’t want me to send violent criminals and terrorists back to Venezuela, or any other Country, for that matter — People that came here illegally!” he wrote. He accused the courts of being “intimidated by the Radical Left who are, ‘playing the Ref.’”Praising Justice Samuel Alito, Trump added, “Great Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito correctly wants to dissolve the pause on deportations. He is right on this!”Arguing that the judicial process for mass deportations was impractical, Trump claimed the country would require “hundreds of thousands of trials” and that it would take “200 years” to give each undocumented immigrant a trial. “Such a thing is not possible to do. What a ridiculous situation we are in,” he wrote.",
