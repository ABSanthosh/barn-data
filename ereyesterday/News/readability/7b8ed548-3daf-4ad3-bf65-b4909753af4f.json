I appreciate this, and perhaps, we will come back to you with another subject. I will say nothing more on that situation. The President and the Secretary have said things, as have the deputy secretary; they have made their positions clear. I will not continue with something of that manner.\"The US government has expressed unwavering support for India following the deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam on 22 April, which claimed 26 lives. The attack targeted tourists at Baisaran meadow and has been described as one of the worst since the 2019 Pulwama tragedy. President Donald Trump personally called Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 23 April to offer condolences and condemn the attack. According to the Ministry of External Affairs, Trump expressed full support for India’s efforts to bring the attackers to justice. Vice President JD Vance also called Modi and reiterated Washington’s readiness to assist in combating terrorism. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later posted on social media, affirming, “The United States stands with India.” In a swift response, the Indian government has taken multiple diplomatic and security steps. After a high-level Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting chaired by PM Modi, India declared Pakistani defence advisors in New Delhi as Persona Non Grata and withdrew its own from Islamabad. Both countries will also reduce their High Commission staff by nearly half by 1 May. Other measures from India include closing the Attari Integrated Check Post, suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, and cancelling visa exemptions for Pakistani nationals under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme. Pakistani nationals in India under SVES visas have been given 48 hours to leave.",
