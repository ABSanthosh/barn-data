  "text": "Israel pummeled Gaza City with more than 15 strikes Thursday, killing more than 40 people and injuring 120 others, the besieged enclave’s civil defense agency said, calling the tempo and number of strikes high compared with recent days.“What is happening now in the Gaza Strip, specifically in Gaza City, is sheer madness by the Israeli occupation forces,” said Mahmoud Bassal, a civil defense agency spokesman. “We are no longer able to respond to all distress calls amid the ongoing bombardment and relentless airstrikes.”He said the strikes hit civilian gatherings. The Israel Defense Forces said it could not comment on the strikes without more specific details on location and timing.The latest wave followed Israeli strikes across Gaza on Wednesday that left at least 13 people dead, including three children and two women. At least 12 people were killed and 41 injured in the final 48 hours of 2024, Gaza’s Health Ministry said.As the military assault continued, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Thursday that the Israeli leader had authorized a delegation of the IDF, the Mossad intelligence agency and the Shin Bet internal security agency to continue negotiations in Doha, Qatar, on a ceasefire and hostage-release deal.In Shejaiya, a district in the eastern part of Gaza City, local resident Ramez Samara said he has been hearing the sounds of explosions since the early hours of the morning.“Every time, there is talk of progress in ceasefire negotiations, yet the opposite is happening on the ground,” he told The Washington Post. “I do not understand what is happening, why all this destruction and why the war does not stop. We want this war to end, not for the bombing and suffering to intensify.”Samara, 47, lost his home in the war and said he and his family have been displaced seven times.“We suffer in every aspect of life: food, water, shelter, even finding clothes,” he said. “Above all, we endure the constant fear brought by relentless bombing.”Here’s what else to knowAn Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis overnight killed Mahmoud Salah, chief of the civilian police force in Gaza, and Hossam Shahwan, a police official, along with several civilians, according to a news release from the Hamas-run Interior Ministry. The Israeli military named Shahwan as the target and accused him of involvement in providing intelligence to Hamas’s military wing to attack the IDF.A delegation from Syria’s de facto government traveled to Saudi Arabia on Thursday as part of a flurry of diplomacy by Syria’s new leader aimed at securing financial aid for the war-torn country and lifting Western sanctions imposed on the ousted Assad regime. The delegation included Syria’s foreign minister and intelligence chief, according to the state-run news agency.The IDF said Thursday that its special forces raided an Iranian-funded, precision-guided missile factory in Syria in September as part of its efforts to thwart the trafficking of arms for Hezbollah. An IDF spokesman, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, called the nighttime raid on the facility one of the “more complex” operations that the Israeli military has carried out in years.Gaza’s Health Ministry said Thursday that at least 28 people were killed in the previous 24 hours, bringing the death toll since the start of Israel’s military operations in Gaza last year to 45,581 people. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, including more than 300 soldiers. It says 390 soldiers have been killed in its military operation in Gaza.",
