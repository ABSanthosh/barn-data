Even before it sent troops, North Korea was supplying Russia with millions of artillery shells.Credit...Nanna Heitmann for The New York TimesMarc Santora and Helene CooperMarc Santora traveled to the Russian border to meet with Ukrainians fighting North Korean troops in Kursk. Helene Cooper reported from Washington.Jan. 22, 2025, 5:01 a.m. ETThe North Korean soldiers fighting for Moscow in Russia’s Kursk region are assigned their own patches of land to assault. Unlike their Russian counterparts, they advance with almost no armored vehicles in support.When they attack, they do not pause to regroup or retreat, as the Russians often do when they start taking heavy losses, Ukrainian soldiers and American officials say. Instead, they move under heavy fire across fields strewed with mines and will send in a wave of 40 or more troops.If they seize a position, they do not try to secure it. They leave that to Russian reinforcements, while they drop back and prepare for another assault.They have also developed singular tactics and habits. When combating a drone, the North Koreans send out one soldier as a lure so others can shoot it down. If they are gravely wounded, they have been instructed to detonate a grenade to avoid being captured alive, holding it under the neck with one hand on the pin as Ukrainian soldiers approach.Sent to Russia to join with Moscow’s troops in Kursk, the North Koreans essentially operate as a separate fighting force, the Ukrainian soldiers and American officials said — distinct in language, training and military culture.“It’s partly two different militaries that have never trained or operated together and partly, I think, Russian military culture, which is, shall we say, not highly respectful of the abilities and norms and operations of partner forces,” said Celeste A. Wallander, who until Inauguration Day was the Pentagon’s assistant secretary for international security affairs.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
