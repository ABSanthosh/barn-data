We spoke to four of them.Willow Park School in Dublin, a private boys school run by the Spiritans religious order. Former students have said they were abused there, and at Blackrock College on the same campus, in the 1960s and 1970s. That has prompted an apology from the Spiritans and a national conversation about abuse in religious schools.Credit...Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York TimesDec. 23, 2024, 12:01 a.m. ETThey came forward in small groups at first. And then they spoke out in waves.Over the past two years, dozens of people, mostly men in their 50s and 60s, have reported being sexually abused at schools run by Catholic orders in Ireland.Their accounts only hint at the magnitude of a national scandal, experts say. In September, a preliminary government inquiry identified almost 2,400 allegations of sexual abuse in religious schools between the 1960s and the 1990s, and 884 alleged abusers. Norma Foley, Ireland’s minister for education, said the scale of abuse was “truly shocking,” and has ordered a full government investigation.While Ireland has long grappled with the legacy of abuse within Catholic church institutions, the latest revelations shed light on how dozens of schools allegedly harbored serial abusers for decades.The fight for accountability has been led by a cohort of older men who are challenging taboos around sexual abuse, masculinity and shame.“Their numbers are so big, and the ripple effect of harm must bring some impact on broader Irish society,” said Tim Chapman, an academic and a practitioner of “restorative justice,” a process that helps people harmed by a crime to communicate with those responsible and to find some resolution.ImageSchool mementoes belonging to John Coulter, who is part of a survivors’ group demanding answers about the abuse they suffered.Credit...Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York TimesImageFaded school yearbooks belonging to Mark Vincent Healy, who was abused at St. Mary’s College, Dublin, between 1969 and 1973.Credit...Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York TimesThank you for your patience while we verify access.
