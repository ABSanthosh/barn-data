  "text": "At least 15 people were killed after US President Donald Trump ordered a military strike on Yemen's Houthi rebels in the capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, warning of \"overwhelming lethal force.\"The Houthis' Ansarollah media updated an earlier casualty count of nine to 15, stating that the strikes hit both the capital, Sanaa, and the northern Saada region. The airstrikes mark the first US military action against the Houthis since Trump’s administration began in January, following the rebels' attacks on Israel and Red Sea vessels amid the Gaza conflict.Earlier, Trump posted on Truth Social his intention to \"use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective\", citing the Huthis' threats to Red Sea shipping.The Houthis released a statement in response declaring that the strikes \"will not pass without response\". \"This aggression will not pass without a response, and our Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to confront escalation with escalation,\" the rebels' political bureau said in a statement on their Al-Masirah television.Trump had also demanded Iran cease support for the rebels immediately. The rebels, controlling substantial parts of Yemen for over ten years, belong to the pro-Iran \"axis of resistance\" groups opposing Israel and the United States.They have conducted numerous drone and missile strikes against vessels near Yemen in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden during the Gaza conflict, expressing solidarity with Palestinians.These actions disrupted the crucial shipping route, which typically handles 12 percent of global maritime traffic, compelling numerous companies to reroute around southern Africa.The US has conducted multiple strikes on Houthi positions, sometimes with British support. The Houthis suspended attacks during Gaza's January ceasefire but announced on Tuesday they would resume until Israel allows aid into Palestinian territory.Trump's communication avoided mentioning the Israel dispute, concentrating on previous Houthi attacks on commercial vessels. \"To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!\" he said.\"Do NOT threaten the American People, their President... or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!\" he added.",
