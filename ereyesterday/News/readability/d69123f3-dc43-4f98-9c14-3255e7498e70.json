Four years down the line, their Montecito neighbors are not very happy about the royals settling at their place. A similar situation is brewing for Harry and Meghan as they are purchasing a house in Comporta, Portugal. The residents are expressing frustration that the coastline is now becoming exclusive to wealthy property owners.UK Express reported that restricting access to public beaches was illegal in Portugal until recently but new regulations now allow local councils and government agencies to designate certain beaches as \"private\". \"Worst thing to happen to the Portuguese coast, typical greed situation. Taking land and property from locals who have been enjoying it for years,\" one wrote. \"I am very upset by this massive piece of Portuguese land destroyed for the rich, removed from the average local that had been creating memories in this place for generations and generations,\" another said. \"I have been going to this place for years, camped there several times and, because of this company, this is no longer possible,\" another said. Reports said Harry and Meghan chose Portugal to be close to Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank who own a home at the Costa Terra Gold and Ocean Club in Melides. Harry and Meghan will not be shifting out of the US and their Portuguese resort will be more like a holiday home for them. Reports said the resort is on a picturesque and unexplored beach in the Algarve and has become a popular holiday destination. Once completed, the resort is set to have 300 homes, with prices starting at a whopping £3.6million.The news has put speculations over Harry-Meghan divorce to sleep following their individual engagements. When Harry was on his solo trip to UK and then South Africa, Meghan made solo appearances back home triggering speculations that they are already living separately though their friends said they are only separating their professional paths and their relationship is rock-solid.",
