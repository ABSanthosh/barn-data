  "text": "Mexico and Canada are sending firefighters and equipment to help battle the blazes scorching Southern California, an expression of solidarity, their leaders said, and recognition of the assistance the United States extends to its neighbors in times of need.The deployments come days before President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office. Trump continues to threaten tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, the United States’ largest trading partners. In launching his first campaign in 2015, he claimed that “when Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best.”Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Saturday that a team of firefighters was on its way to Los Angeles, where multiple conflagrations have burned more than 37,000 acres and killed at least 11 people.Sheinbaum said the team was carrying “the courage and heart of Mexico.” The mission, according to Mexico’s civil protection agency, was “to support the fight” against the fires.“Mexico’s solidarity extends beyond our borders to protect lives and nature,” the agency said in a post on X.California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said he was “deeply grateful” for the support.Quebec sent two water bombers — planes that can drop water or flame retardant — in addition to two sent in August. Alberta was deploying a crew of up to 40 firefighters. British Columbia was sending a team of senior technical staff at the request of California’s fire agency, with which it already has a strong relationship, the Canadian government said. The federal government, the Canadian Armed Forces and other provinces were prepared to send more.“Our American friends have asked for help to fight the wildfires in California and Team Canada is responding,” Harjit S. Sajjan, Canada’s minister of emergency preparedness, said Sunday on X. “Sixty firefighters from Alberta and B.C. will be deployed as soon as tomorrow and we’re working to identify and prepare more resources to send over the days ahead. Neighbours helping neighbours.”Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday posted video of a twin-propeller airplane dropping water on a wildfire captioned “neighbours helping neighbors.”“Canada and the United States are more than just neighbours,” he posted on X. “We’re friends — especially when times get tough.”The foreign firefighters could help relieve exhausted crews battling the fires that have proved extremely difficult to tame. High winds have fueled the flames and complicated suppression efforts.The Canadians and Mexicans are joining thousands of state and local firefighters, including hundreds of California prison inmates who embed with professionals. The controversial program has drawn criticism from human rights advocates.Private firefighters have also joined the effort. The practice has highlighted a class divide: It often involves insurance companies that offer the contractors as an optional policy benefit, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
