  "text": "Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Thursday said that she has created a special team group, the Directors' Initiative Group, which is investigating Dr Fauci for perjury and his role in funding Wuhan gain-of-function research tied to COVID-19.In a podcast, \"Megyn Kelly Show\" Gabbard said, \" I created kind of a special teams group, the Directors Initiative Group, that is focused on investigating a number of the President's top priorities and the things that the American people really deserve and want to know the truth about The Origins of COVID 19 is one of them. So they're actively working on that. A lot of the work that's been done is on Covid.gov.\"During the pandemic, Dr Fauci became the face of the US Covid-19 response. He was questioned about National Institute of Health (NIH) funding for virology research at the Wuhan lab.An US-based organisation - EcoHealth Alliance - was awarded a grant in 2014 from the NIH to look into possible coronaviruses from bats. Some funds were given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in an agreement that was terminated in April 2020.Over the revamping of Covid.gov. website, host Megyn Kelly said that the older website was annoying to watch with YouTube and all social media used to refer people with Fauci talking points. The DNI also said that Jay Bhattacharya, the new NIH director with secretary Kennedy is looking at the gain of function research that in the case of the Wuhan Lab, as well as many others around many of these other bio labs around the world was actually US funded and leads to this dangerous kind of research that in many examples has resulted in either a pandemic or some other major health crisis.Responding to a query whether it is true that it was Peter Daszak's research with the Wuhan that caused this pandemic, then US did fund it. Then Anthony Fauci helped fund the pandemic, Gabbard said, \"We are working on that with Jay Bhattacharya and look forward to being able to share that hopefully very soon. Okay, that, that specific link, correct. Between the gain of function research and what we saw with COVID 19. ..Things that he denied over and over and over to Senator Rand Paul's questioning. Under oath. So is it any wonder that he sought a preemptive pardon for anything during a certain period of time by President.\"It is pertinent to mention that Dr Fauci, during a senate hearing on May 11, 2021, had told under oath that the NIH never carried out gain-of-function research in Wuhan.\"And the reason why this is so important is not just what happened in the past. It's because this gain of function research is happening in biolabs around the world. I got attacked and I think you saw this we've probably talked about in your show before when I warned against US funded bio labs in Ukraine when the Russia Ukraine war kicked off for this very reason. Who knows what kinds of pathogens are in these labs and if released could create another Covid like pandemic. And for that I was called a Russian asset. You're trumpeting Putin's talking points. All of this nonsense simply for speaking the truth and stating facts that by the way are still on US Embassy Ukraine's website today about how the US has funded these biolabs in Ukraine. But in order to. My point is, in order to prevent another Covid like pandemic or another major health incident that could affect us in the world, we have to end this gain of function research and provide the evidence that shows exactly why and how it's in our best interest, the American people's best interest, to bring about an end to it,\" she added.",
