  "text": "Norman Tebbit, a right-wing British politician who became one of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s closest allies, working to dilute the strength of organized labor while being considered as a potential successor at 10 Downing Street, died July 7. He was 94.His son William said in a statement that Mr. Tebbit died at home. He did not share additional details.Mr. Tebbit, who was known as Lord Tebbit after being appointed to the House of Lords in 1992, was a fierce and uncompromising advocate for Thatcher’s conservative agenda — and a pithy, sophisticated embodiment of the up-by-your-bootstraps ethos she championed across her 11 years as prime minister.A son of working-class parents from north London, Mr. Tebbit worked as an airline pilot before being elected to the House of Commons in 1970. He joined Thatcher’s cabinet in 1981, serving successively as employment secretary, trade secretary and eventually chairman of the Conservative Party, all while rallying opposition to labor unions and extolling the virtues of self-reliance, free markets and free trade.Overcoming opposition from union leaders — ironically, Mr. Tebbit had been one himself while working as a pilot — he introduced and helped pass legislation that diminished the power of “closed shop” agreements, in which employers agree to only hire union members. The 1982 law raised the level of compensation for workers who were fired for not belonging to a union, in addition to removing immunity protections so that unions could be held liable for civil damages.Mr. Tebbit called the legislation his “greatest achievement in government,” writing in a 1988 memoir, “Upwardly Mobile,” that he believed it was “one of the principal pillars on which the Thatcher economic reforms have been built.”In person, Mr. Tebbit could be charmingly funny or, when the mood struck him, sharply abrasive. He once urged a recently hospitalized colleague, a left-wing member of Parliament, to go off and “have another heart attack.” His other targets included multiculturalism, political correctness and same-sex marriage, which he deemed “impertinent.” Elsewhere, he accused Muslims of threatening “our way of life in our own country” and went after the perceived liberal bias of the BBC, which “thinks that Guardian-reading champagne socialists are the norm.”Michael Foot, a longtime Labour Party leader, once likened him to “a semi-house-trained polecat,” while the ITV series “Spitting Image,” a satirical puppet show, caricatured Mr. Tebbit as a leather-clad skinhead, rapping opponents on the knuckles while serving as Thatcher’s chief enforcer. (Mr. Tebbit was amused by the portrayal, and said he appreciated that whenever his puppet got into fights he always came out on top.)After urban riots in 1981, Mr. Tebbit delivered one of his most memorable speeches, telling Conservative colleagues that amid widespread unemployment during the Depression, his father “didn’t riot. He got on his bike and looked for work, and he kept looking till he found it.”Critics, deeming his remarks insensitive, took to using the derisive nickname “Onyerbike.”Nearly a decade later, Mr. Tebbit controversially suggested that Asian and Caribbean immigrants were not truly British unless they rooted for England’s cricket team, instead of supporting squads from their ancestral homelands.“A large proportion of Britain’s Asian population fail to pass the cricket test,” he said in a 1990 interview. “Which side do they cheer for? It’s an interesting test. Are you still harking back to where you came from or where you are?”Mr. Tebbit’s reputation as a bruising conservative politician remained intact for decades. But he also became known for the fortitude he showed after being wounded — and nearly losing his wife, Margaret — in the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing. The Tebbits were lying in their bed at the Grand Brighton Hotel, home to a Conservative Party conference, when the Provisional Irish Republican Army detonated a bomb behind a bathroom wall, intending to kill Thatcher in a nearby room.The militants, who aimed to make Northern Ireland a part of the Republic of Ireland, missed their primary target but killed five others. They injured more than 30 people, including Mr. Tebbit and his wife, who fell through four floors after the ceiling came crashing down on top of them.Trapped in the rubble, they were able to hold hands as they drifted in and out of consciousness before being separated, according to Mr. Tebbitt. He was taken out of the rubble on a stretcher in his pajamas and brought to a hospital, where he was reportedly asked if he had any allergies. “Yes,” he replied, “bombs.”The blast left him with a broken shoulder blade, collarbone and vertebrae, along with rib and hip injuries. His wife was paralyzed from the neck down. She spent the next two years in the hospital.In the months before the bombing, political analysts eyed Mr. Tebbit as a potential heir to Thatcher, who resigned amid a leadership challenge in 1990. But after leading the Conservatives to a landslide victory in the 1987 election, he left the cabinet to work in business, serving on corporate boards to help pay for his wife’s health care.Mr. Tebbit said that while he knew he would eventually have to step away to care for his wife, quitting politics immediately was out of the question. “That would have been to give the IRA another victory,” he told the Telegraph in 2022. “The only occasion when I was ever cheered from all sides of the House was when I came back in after the hospital to take my seat.”Well into retirement, Mr. Tebbit continued to advocate for conservative causes in editorials for the Telegraph and the Sun. He supported Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, praising one of its most prominent champions, Nigel Farage, as “a very clever political operator,” and bashed Conservative colleagues who failed to meet his standards. The Guardian quoted him as saying that John Major, Thatcher’s successor, “has the mulishness of a weak man with stupidity.”Occasionally he was asked about his would-be assailants. Interviewed by the BBC 30 years after the Brighton bombing, he said there was “no possibility of any forgiveness” for former IRA militants including Patrick Magee, who was sent to prison for planting the bomb.Magee was released as part of the Good Friday peace agreements, although as Mr. Tebbit saw it, he and other ex-paramilitaries had failed to show contrition. “One can hope that there’s a particularly hot corner of hell reserved for them,” he said, “and they can repent in their own time there.”The second of three sons, Norman Beresford Tebbit was born in Ponders End, part of the Enfield section of London, on March 29, 1931. His father worked at a pawnbroker’s shop. His mother, a butcher’s daughter, taught him to skin a rabbit, stimulating an interest in cooking that eventually spurred him to write “The Game Cook,” a 2009 guidebook.At age 16, Mr. Tebbit left school to clerk at the Financial Times, where he developed a frustration with closed shop policies after being told he was required to join a printers union.Mr. Tebbit joined the Royal Air Force in 1949, completing his national service as a pilot. A few years later, while serving in the reserve, his Meteor jet fighter skidded off the runway and went up in flames. Mr. Tebbit escaped through the canopy and later marveled at his good fortune — telling a friend, according to the Times of London, that ever since the accident he felt like he was “playing with the casino’s money.”In 1953, he joined what is now British Airways, where he worked as a pilot and navigator. He married Margaret Daines three years later.His wife, a trained nurse, resumed her career after assisting Mr. Tebbit during his early years in the House of Commons. She struggled with severe postpartum depression after the birth of their third child, leading Mr. Tebbit to go on extended leave to look after her and the children.Margaret Tebbit died in 2020. Survivors include their three children, John, Alison and William. Additional information on survivors was not immediately available.In 2014, Mr. Tebbit published a children’s book, his first, about a talking dog named Ben who helps a paraplegic boy. Interviewed by the Daily Mail that year, he noted that he once had lofty political ambitions, although the Brighton bombing changed all that.“I would have given it a go,” he said of a potential run for Number 10, as the prime minister’s residence is known. It was a “good address,” he added. “Nice garden — good for a dog.”",
