  "text": "China condemned the Trump administration’s tariffs after his 10 percent baseline tax went into effect Saturday, but reactions elsewhere were more muted, as foreign officials looked to talks to resolve the widening trade war.“The market has spoken,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun wrote in a Facebook post, with an image showing the fall in U.S. stock markets on Friday. “The trade and tariff war started by the U.S. against the world is unprovoked and unjustified,” he continued.President Donald Trump’s Wednesday announcement of sweeping tariffs — including a 10 percent tax on most imported goods and an additional punitive import tax tailored individually for about 60 countries — caused outrage and confusion across the world.Beijing on Friday responded with an additional 34 percent tariff on U.S. exports — the same rate Trump imposed on China. Lin Jian, another spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, described the U.S. decision as “an attempt to subvert the existing global economic and trade order, to put American interests above the common interests of the international community.”While retaliation from other countries is expected, some officials abroad have sounded a more conciliatory tone.Italian Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said Saturday that his country was working toward a “de-escalation” with the United States, the Reuters news agency reported.“We should avoid launching a policy of counter-tariffs that could be damaging for everyone and especially for us,” he said, adding that “we must try to keep a cool head.”Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Saturday said he planned to speak with Trump “within the next week” to discuss the tariffs, according to the Japan Times.On Friday, Singapore’s Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said the country would not impose reciprocal tariffs but warned that “other countries may not exercise the same restraint. The likelihood of a full-blown global trade war is growing.”Late Friday, Cambodia’s prime minister shared a letter on social media requesting negotiations with the Trump administration “at the earliest convenient time” and pledging to drop tariffs on U.S. imports as an “expression of our good faith and in spirit of strengthening our bilateral trade relations.”And, as The Washington Post reported Friday, the British government is ready to make major concessions to reach a deal with the Trump administration, with officials optimistic that a trade deal to remove or reduce the 10 percent tariffs could be reached within weeks.French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday and said afterward that they would “closely coordinate” their positions on tariffs in anticipation of negotiations with Washington.Meanwhile, Trump ally Elon Musk, who had been notably silent on the new tariffs, called on Saturday for what he described as a “free-trade zone between Europe and North America.”“I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move to a zero tariff situation,” Musk said in a video conference Saturday with Italy’s far-right League party.On Friday, Trump said he was open to negotiations with individual countries, though White House surrogates had previously insisted that the new tariff policy was not intended as a starting point for trade negotiations. “Every country is calling us,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “If we would have asked these countries to do us a favor, they would have said no. Now they will do anything for us.”After speaking with Vietnamese leader To Lam on Friday, Trump posted on social media that the Southeast Asian nation was willing to cut its own tariffs to zero and that the two countries would meet to discuss a possible agreement.The U.N. Trade and Development organization, UNCTAD, on Friday urged “dialogue and negotiation.”“This hurts the vulnerable and the poor,” UNCTAD Secretary General Rebeca Grynspan said in a statement. “Trade must not become another source of instability. It should serve development and global growth.”Lyric Li contributed to this report.",
