Mike Norman told FOX 8 that what began as a standard response grew rapidly.“We just needed the manpower on scene,” Norman said. “We ended up with 20 companies, 80 firefighters.”No injuries were reported, but firefighters inside the building faced a dangerous and unpredictable fire. Shooting at local school parking lot, more than a dozen injured “We had some tanks inside. You could hear them letting go,” Norman said. “There were several explosions we heard. We had a partial wall collapse.”The fire eventually spread to a second building and threatened nearby homes, prompting multiple evacuations.Norman said the cause of the fire is still under investigation. However, he confirmed that roofing materials stored inside the warehouse helped accelerate the flames, making them spread more rapidly.“It was a tricky fire to fight,” Norman added. “We were fighting it defensively. When we go to a fire, we want to put it out by the source. But in a fire like this, it becomes a surround and drown.”Even hours after crews gained control, smoke still lingered in the air and for the families impacted, so did the uncertainty.“We don’t know,” Johnson said. “My coworker said that if we needed to stay with her, we could.”Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
