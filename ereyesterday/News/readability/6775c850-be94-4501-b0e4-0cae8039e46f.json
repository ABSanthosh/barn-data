  "text": "Nvidia said the U.S. government is allowing the Silicon Valley giant to sell its artificial intelligence chips to China, indicating a course reversal in Washington’s ban on such sales and a tentative de-escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions.The company said in a blog post Monday that it is filing applications with the U.S. government to sell its H20 chips to China and that Washington has assured the company that export licenses will be granted. The sale of the chips has been banned since April.The loosening of the ban followed the announcement of a trade framework that Washington and Beijing agreed to last month in London, in which both sides agreed to roll back some trade restrictions. For its part, Beijing has in recent weeks eased its chokehold on rare earth sales to the United States and approved software company Synopsys’ acquisition of Ansys, a deal between two U.S. companies that Chinese regulators had help up.The news sent Nvidia’s stock soaring on Tuesday, with its shares up 4.4 percent by the early afternoon. But it also prompted debate in Washington policy circles over the security considerations of resuming the AI chip sales, and whether Beijing’s throttling access to rare earths for U.S. manufacturers may have forced the Trump administration’s hand.“The leverage Beijing gained from putting in place a global licensing regime around rare earths and magnets caught U.S. officials and industry by surprise,” said Paul Triolo, a partner at the consulting firm DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on CNBC Tuesday that the administration changed course because the chip wasn’t one of Nvidia’s cutting-edge ones and they wanted China to still be “addicted” to using the American technology ecosystem.“We want everyone to use our technology stack, our way of thinking about AI and let the world be balanced on ours,” Lutnick said. “Now, really, it’s a competition between the American standards and the Chinese standards.”Some lawmakers were blindsided by the reversal. While Lutnick told CNBC that the Nvidia move was linked to the June rare earths deal, Under Secretary Jeffrey Kessler assured congressional staffers in a meeting last month that the chip was not part of the deal, according to a person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss an internal meeting.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian declined to comment on the specific announcement on Tuesday, but said that China opposes the “weaponization” of technology and trade issues as disrupting “the stability of the industrial supply chain.”Nvidia said it “hopes to start deliveries soon.” It also announced a new chip for Chinese customers it said is “fully compliant” with U.S. export regulations. It remains unclear what volumes of the chips Washington will allow the company to sell to China.The announcement comes as Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, is visiting Beijing this week, after meeting President Donald Trump in Washington on Thursday.The development underscores the firm’s attempt to straddle the U.S. and China, even as the two largest economies in the world struggle to manage trade tensions and competition over critical technologies like artificial intelligence.“Nvidia’s story and its position is shared by countless American corporates who find themselves caught in the crosshairs of the U.S.-China geopolitical competition,” said Ryan Fedasiuk, a former tech policy adviser in the U.S. State Department’s Office of China Coordination in the Biden administration.“But Nvidia may be unique in that it is such an important company for the global economy and for American national security,” he said.Nvidia, which became the first publicly traded company to close at a $4 trillion market capitalization this month, makes chips necessary to train the most advanced AI models.China is an important market for the firm: It is home to a slew of leading artificial intelligence firms and a rich ecosystem of developers. About 13 percent of Nvidia’s revenue came from China last year, according to company filings.But Nvidia’s business in China has spurred concern in Washington, where some are concerned that selling chips to China could be helping Beijing’s military and could degrade the U.S.'s position in global high-tech competition.U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jim Banks emphasized those concerns in a letter on Friday to Huang about his trip to China, asking the executive not to meet with any companies working with China’s “military or intelligence establishment.”Huang has been dismissive of those concerns and criticized Washington’s export controls.Asked in an interview with CNN on Sunday about the possibility of Nvidia’s chips being used by Chinese military and intelligence, Huang said: “We don’t have to worry about that.”He also argued that in order for the U.S. to maintain AI leadership, American technology needs to remain the “global standard” and used by developers all across the world.Not everyone agrees with this argument. “It’s very hard to disentangle China’s AI ambitions for the commercial space from the military space,” said a former U.S. Commerce Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security matters.“Jensen has been very clear that he doesn’t see a military nexus to what he sells,” the former official said, but “there was plenty of open source and classified intelligence showing that the PLA was working quite hard to get its hands on these chips,” using the abbreviation for China’s People’s Liberation Army.Overall, Trump’s more unpredictable and “transactional” approach to export controls is concerning to international partners, said Chiang Min-yen, deputy director for economic security at Research Institute for Democracy, Society and Emerging Technology (DSET), a Taipei think tank. These partners are also needed to effectively limit China’s access to technology.“We need the long term commitment from the U.S. side to coordinate these like-minded countries to achieve the same strategic goal, but that is not what we see it at this moment,” he said.Huang’s visit to China this week — his third this year — includes visits with government and industry leaders, according to the company. He will also hold a news conference on Wednesday. In April, Huang met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Beijing.An article published Tuesday in The Paper, a Chinese state-run outlet, said Huang’s visits “reaffirm his commitment to the Chinese market at a critical moment.”Though Chinese tech firms are likely cheering Washington’s new policy, Beijing is also attempting to reduce reliance on oversees technology like Nvidia chips and develop homegrown alternatives through Chinese giants like Huawei Technologies.“China is in a weird position because they continue to be dependent on Nvidia and its product lines to sustain near-term growth in China’s AI industry,” said Fedasiuk. “But I think it should be clear to Nvidia that the company is dispensable in China. China is actively pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into an effort to dispense with Nvidia in its market.”Pei-Lin Wu in Taipei contributed to this report.",
