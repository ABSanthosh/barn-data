The Colombian minister of defense condemned the attack on X and offered a reward of up to 3 billion Colombian pesos, or $728,000, for any information leading to the capture of the perpetrators.He said that he had ordered the military, national police and intelligence agencies “to deploy all their capabilities to urgently clarify the facts” and would soon hold a meeting to determine a strategy moving forward.“This attack pains us. It mobilizes us to redouble our efforts to protect life, guarantee free political participation, and deliver justice,” he added.President Gustavo Petro expressed his condolences on X.“My solidarity with the Uribe family,” he wrote. “I don’t know how to ease their pain.”This is a developing story.Simón Posada contributed reporting from Bogotá.Genevieve Glatsky is a reporter for The Times, based in Bogotá, Colombia.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT",
