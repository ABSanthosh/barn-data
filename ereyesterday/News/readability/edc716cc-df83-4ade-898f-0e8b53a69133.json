  "text": "Here are the latest developments.President Bashar al-Assad of Syria arrived in Russia on Sunday evening after fleeing his country, according to Russian state media and two Iranian officials. It was a stunning fall for the longtime dictator who lost his hold on power to a lightning fast offensive by rebels who took control of Damascus on Sunday.Mr. al-Assad’s ouster was an earthshaking moment in the history of Syria, which the al-Assad family had ruled with an iron fist since the early 1970s. Rebel factions that have been trying to unseat him for more than a decade upended his government in a matter of days, after years of civil war.Many in Syria greeted Mr. al-Assad’s fall with hope after long living in fear of a government that had gassed its own people during the civil war and used oppressive tactics to silence dissent. But deep uncertainty over who will rule Syria next raised worries of a possible power vacuum in a country where competing factions have vied for territory against each other and Mr. al-Assad’s forces.“Our hearts are dancing with joy,” Walaa Salameh, 35, a resident of the Damascus area, said in a phone interview. “We can’t predict the future and anything is possible, but the most important thing is we got rid of this oppressive regime.”Russian state media said that Mr. al-Assad and his family had arrived in Moscow and been granted political asylum. The New York Times could not immediately independently confirm that Mr. al-Assad was in Russia, which along with Iran had helped keep him in power.On Sunday, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the Islamist rebel leader who spearheaded the rebel offensive, declared the group’s achievement “a victory for the whole Islamic nation,” speaking from the Umayyad Mosque, an ancient landmark in Damascus, the capital. His group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, once linked to Al Qaeda, has tried to gain international legitimacy by eschewing jihadist ambitions and focusing on organized governance.President Biden, speaking from the White House, said that the United States would support the region “should any threat arrive from Syria during this period of transition,” noting the terrorist roots of many of the rebels. But he underlined that Washington would engage with “all Syrian groups” to establish a transition “toward an independent, sovereign Syria.”Here’s what else is happening:Targeting the Islamic State: U.S. airstrikes struck dozens of Islamic State camps and leaders in central Syria on Sunday in one of the largest military strikes in months, the United States Central Command said in a statement, adding that 75 “targets” had been hit. The statement said that the United States would continue to target the terrorist group throughout the “dynamic period in Syria.” A senior U.S. military official said the strikes were intended to make clear the United States was still combating the group and dissuade the new regime from cooperating with them.Syria transition: As questions swirled early on Sunday over Mr. al-Assad’s whereabouts, Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali, Syria’s prime minister, said that he would stay in the country and was ready to work with whomever Syrians choose as their leader. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham said it would work with Mr. al-Jalali and called on Syrian military forces in Damascus to stay away from public institutions, which it said would remain under the prime minister’s supervision until they are formally handed over.Missing American: Mr. Biden and the family of Austin Tice, an American journalist who disappeared in Syria in 2012, said on Sunday that they believe that he is alive and could be returned to the United States after rebels groups toppled Mr. al-Assad. “We think we can get him back, but we have no direct evidence of that yet,” Mr. Biden said. The United States has said it believed Mr. Tice had been held captive by the government of Mr. al-Assad, although his regime had long maintained that it had no information about him.Assad’s allies: Mr. al-Assad had kept rebel forces at bay for more than a decade with Iranian and Russian military support. But in recent days, Iran and Russia appeared to be turning to diplomacy to preserve their interests in the country rather than significant military support. The Foreign Ministry of Iran said decision-making about the future of Syria was “solely the responsibility” of Syrians. Russia requested an emergency closed consultation of the U.N. Security Council to discuss Syria’s fall and the repercussions for security in the region, according to Council diplomats.Broader instability: Israel’s military said it had entered a demilitarized buffer zone in territory it controls in the Golan Heights, abutting Syria. The Israeli military, which is concerned about the sudden surge in instability near its borders, said it was acting to protect Israeli civilians. Iraq has secured its border with Syria, according to the official Iraqi News Agency, which said on Sunday that the Al-Qaim border crossing was closed.Footage shows a chaotic scene after rebels capture a notorious prison.VideoCreditCredit...Independent Doctors AssociationVideos sent to The Times by a group of doctors visiting Syria’s Sednaya Prison following the fall of Damascus to rebel forces show the dire conditions inside the facility, which has been notorious as a site for torturing and executing political prisoners.The footage was shared by the Independent Doctors Association, a nongovernmental organization providing humanitarian and medical assistance in Syria. Rebels appeared to have captured the prison complex, freeing the prisoners inside, after making it a central focus of their campaign. Numbered cells, each of which appear to have held a dozen or more people, are seen littered with debris, clothing and personal belongings. In one area, tomatoes and dirty coffee filters are scattered on the floor. The walls and ceilings are crumbling. Journalists, armed fighters and civilians, including children, roam the prison. Several men scrape at the concrete and grates along a wall, in an attempt to access hidden cells where more prisoners are believed to still be held.In another scene, family members pour through paper records seeking information on their loved ones. “They’re looking at the medical records and prisoner records — hoping,” says the doctor recording the scene.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based organization that documents human rights abuses in Syria, has estimated that more than 30,000 detainees have been killed in Sednaya Prison.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWith Syria in flux, Turkey attacks U.S.-backed forces.ImageDestroying a statue of Bassel al-Assad, the ousted president’s brother, on Sunday in Qamishli, Syria, on the border with Turkey.Credit...Delil Souleiman/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe Turkish military fired on U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northern Syria this weekend, a war monitoring group and a spokesman for the Kurdish group said on Sunday, illuminating the tangle of competing interests and alliances in Syria in the wake of the government’s collapse.Fighting erupted on Saturday in Manbij, a Kurdish-controlled city near Syria’s border with Turkey, between rebel groups, one backed by the United States and the other by Turkey. At least 22 members of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces were killed in and around Manbij, and 40 others were wounded, according to the Kurdish group.The clashes preceded a call on Sunday between Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and his Turkish counterpart, Defense Minister Yasar Guler.The other fighters, the Syrian National Army, were supported in their assault of Manbij by Turkish air power, including warplanes, according to a spokesmen for the Syrian Democratic Forces. And a Turkish “kamikaze drone” exploded at a Kurdish military base on Saturday, according to the monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Turkey and the United States are allies, sworn to protect each other as members of the NATO alliance. Though both countries celebrated Sunday’s ouster of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, their interests diverge over support for the Kurds in northern Syria, far from Damascus, the capital.In their call on Sunday, Mr. Austin and Mr. Guler agreed that coordination was necessary “to prevent further escalation of an already volatile situation, as well as to avoid any risk to U.S. forces and partners,” according a readout of the conversation released by the Pentagon. The United States also acknowledged Turkey’s “legitimate security concerns.”The Kurds have been instrumental partners for the United States in fighting the Islamic State, an Islamist terrorist group that rose to power early in Syria’s civil war, more than a decade ago.The Kurds now control much of Syria’s northeast under an autonomous civil administration. About 900 U.S. troops are deployed to Syria to support the Kurdish forces. American forces have patrolled around Manbij with Turkey in the past, but it was not immediately clear if any U.S. troops were in the city this weekend during the Turkish bombardment.On Sunday, the United States announced it had conducted one of the largest strikes against Islamic State targets in months.Turkey views armed Kurds so close to its border as a threat. For decades Tukey has fought Kurdish separatists, who seek to carve out an independent country.Turkey has backed several rebel groups in Syria, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the group of seemingly reformed Al Qaeda members whose lightning-fast push to Damascus toppled the authoritarian government on Sunday. Turkey also has backed the Syrian National Army, a ragtag force made up of mercenaries and criminals, to help maintain a buffer zone along its border with Syria to guard against the activities of Kurdish militants.Turkey and its proxies in the S.N.A. “are looking to utilize the current chaos to rewrite the map in Turkey’s favor,” said Devorah Margolin, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “They are using the distraction of Damascus to continue to grab power during this time of chaos and to undermine the S.D.F., ensuring its negotiating power is weakened.”The power vacuum created by the fall of Damascus presents an opportunity for Turkey to increase its power and influence in Syria generally but particularly along its border, said Natasha Hall, a senior fellow with the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The weekend’s fighting was condemned by the Kurdish-run civil administration of northern Syria.“The other part of Syria is liberated from the tyranny of Assad,” said Sinam Mohamad, who represents the Kurdish autonomous region in its dealings with the United States.Turkey and its proxies, he said, “want to create another conflict,” adding, “We don’t want to have conflict in the region.”Stunned Iranian officials try to distance their country from the fallen Assad government.ImageThe damage after Syrians looted the Iranian Embassy in Damascus, Syria’s capital, on Sunday.Credit...Omar Haj Kadour/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIranians watched in astonishment over the weekend as the reign of their nation’s longtime political and military ally, Bashar al-Assad, came to a crashing end. By Sunday, the reckoning had arrived as officials and pundits recognized that Iran was taken by surprise, and they hurried to distance Iran from a tyrant the country had supported in maintaining power.Iranian leaders and military commanders said in public statements that it was up to Syrians to decide what kind of government should replace Mr. al-Assad, who resigned and fled Syria on Sunday after rebel forces stormed the country’s capital.“It is the Syrian people who must decide on the future of their country and its political and governmental system,” said President Masoud Pezeshkian of Iran in a meeting with his cabinet on Sunday, according to state media outlets. He added that Syrians must be free to do so without violence and foreign meddling.It was yet another remarkable turnabout for Iran after withdrawing its military forces on Friday when the collapse of Mr. al-Assad’s government became inevitable.State television channels candidly discussed Iran’s policies, with officials and pundits admitting that Iran had misjudged the regional dynamics and officials had overlooked Mr. Assad’s unpopularity among Syrians, which also reflected Iran’s lack of support there.Hatef Salehi, an analyst who supports Iran’s government, said in a live town hall discussion on the audio chat app Clubhouse that “the most important lesson of Syria for the Islamic Republic is that no government can last without the support of the people.”Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said on a live television interview that Iran had received intelligence suggesting that rebels in Syria’s Idlib Province were organizing an uprising in the north. He said Iran had relayed the report to Syria’s government and army, but still “nobody could believe” Mr. al-Assad’s collapse.ImageForeign Minister Abbas Araghchi of Iran, left, speaking along with Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein of Iraq, center, and Foreign Minister Bassam al-Sabbagh of Syria following a trilateral meeting in Baghdad on Sunday.Credit...Ahmad Al-Rubaye/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“What caught us off guard was, one, the inability of Syria’s army to confront the movement and, second, the speed of developments,” Mr. Araghchi said.Mr. Araghchi said that when he traveled last week to Syria, Mr. al-Assad had expressed concern to him and complained about the army’s unwillingness to fight back. Mr. Araghchi said his impression was that the Syrian president did not have an accurate read of the situation.Mr. Araghchi confirmed that Iran and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel group that led the offensive against Syria’s government, had exchanged diplomatic messages ahead of the fall of Damascus, Syria’s capital. He said Iran had requested protection for its embassy and Shiite religious shrines and that the rebels had agreed.Still, a crowd of rebel supporters stormed Iran’s Embassy in Damascus shortly after the fall and ransacked the building, destroying furniture and documents, according to videos and photographs circulating in Iranian media. They also climbed the entrance fence of the embassy and tore down huge posters of Hezbollah’s leader who was recently killed by Israel, Hassan Nasrallah, and Iran’s slain top general, Qassim Suleimani, who had commanded troops in Syria’s civil war in support of the Assad government.Iran’s Foreign Ministry said all of its diplomatic staff were safe and no one was present when the building was vandalized.Ordinary Iranians experienced a range of emotions as they watched jubilant Syrians flood the streets, tearing down symbols of Mr. Assad’s oppressive government.“All I can think about is the fall of Iran’s dictatorship regime. Will this sweet moment finally arrive?” Behrouz, 33, an engineer from Iran, said in a telephone interview.He and other Iranians The New York Times interviewed asked to be identified by only their first names for fear of reprisals.Lili, a 40-year-old university professor, said her first emotion upon hearing the news of Mr. Assad’s fall was “a sense of escape, of being let go, of freedom. And then will I, will we, ever see this day?”But supporters of Iran’s government lamented on social media and in live town hall discussions that the loss of Syria was yet another devastating blow to Iran’s network of militant allies in the region.“The Berlin Wall of unity for the axis of resistance has collapsed. That’s it,” said Meysam Karim Jaffari, a conservative journalist and analyst affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards Corps, referring to Iran’s network of regional allies that included Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Syrian government, the Houthis of Yemen and armed groups in Syria and Iraq.In just a few months, several top leaders of these militant groups were eliminated by Israeli assassinations or political upheaval. Analysts noted that these events signified a pivotal shift in the region’s history, particularly after Hamas’s attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, but in a direction that starkly contradicted Iran’s aspirations.“The fall of Assad puts an exclamation point on the fact that decades of Iranian strategy and investment in the Levant have come undone in a matter of weeks,” said Ali Vaez, the Iran director for the International Crisis Group, a conflict resolution organization.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSyrians in New York City celebrate the fall of Assad.ImageMarcelle Shehwaro, center, a Syrian activist, celebrated the fall of the Assad regime along with other activists and supporters in Washington Square Park on Sunday.Credit...Victor J. Blue for The New York TimesAround 100 people gathered in Washington Square Park in Lower Manhattan on Sunday afternoon to celebrate the fall of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who fled his country after rebel forces stormed the capital earlier in the day.Syrian expatriates and their supporters beat drums and sang revolutionary songs in Arabic, holding hands and forming circles for the dabke, a dance that is common at celebrations in the Middle East. Some were draped in the flag of the Syrian opposition, with green, white and black stripes and three red stars.Others chanted anti-Assad slogans and, after reading news reports that Russian and Iranian officials had said that Mr. al-Assad had fled to Russia, joked about going to Moscow to force him to leave there as well. As the celebration continued in the square, people distributed baklava and shawarma.One attendee, Marcelle Shehwaro, 40, from Aleppo, Syria, said she had been compelled to leave because of her participation in political activism there. While she does not know what to expect, she said, she is cautiously happy.“I don’t want to think about the next phase in Syria’s future because I want to take in the happiness of this historical moment,” she said in Arabic.After government forces killed her mother, Ms. Shehwaro said, she staged a demonstration and published criticism of the regime under her real name, which made her a target. She was questioned multiple times by the secret police and lived in hiding for a while, she said. She left the country in 2014.Ms. Shehwaro said she had given up on returning to Syria. But after seeing reports in recent days that rebels were freeing prisoners of Mr. al-Assad’s regime, she felt jubilant, and believed that justice was being restored.Ms. Shehwaro has some family members “who have been scared to contact me for 12 years,” she said, “and now we are finally in touch.”Hazem Alanani, 33, also from Aleppo, works in health care I.T. and said he left Syria in 2019. He also participated in political demonstrations in the country and was questioned by the secret police, and said he considered himself lucky to have never been jailed.He said that many Syrians had abandoned hope of regime change. “It was disheartening for me and I went through an overwhelming amount of hopelessness and helplessness while the Syrian regime was gaining ground” in recent years, Mr. Alanani said.This weekend’s developments came as a shock. “I haven’t gotten the chance to completely process it,” he said, adding, “I broke down crying many times when I realized what had happened.”He went on, “Everything that we chanted for and fought for in the early days of the revolution has become a reality.”Explosions and fires erupted around Damascus on Sunday.VideoVideos and photos verified by The New York Times show that at least five locations in central and suburban Damascus, Syria’s capital, caught fire on Sunday afternoon.Damage visible in three of the locations indicates they were targeted with explosives. While it’s unclear what caused the explosions and fires, local news outlets reported that Israeli airstrikes had targeted the sites.The Israeli military declined to answer questions about whether its forces were responsible for the strikes in and around the Syrian capital.But two Israeli officials, speaking anonymously to discuss sensitive developments, separately told The Times that the Israeli Air Force had been striking various targets in the country to destroy Syrian military assets since Saturday.All five locations where The Times verified images of fires or explosions were government or military facilities.The three locations that showed signs of explosives were all military sites: the Mezzeh Air Base, a site that belonged to the Syrian Army’s Fourth Armored Division and another belonging to a unit suspected of being associated with Syria’s chemical weapons program.Fires also broke out at the Immigration and Passport Department and in a neighborhood containing several administrative buildings.The photographs and videos show huge clouds of black smoke billowing into the air over each of the sites. In some of the locations, blasts and flames are visible.The Israeli military wrote on social media on Sunday morning that it was “not interfering with the internal events in Syria.”Israel has historically conducted occasional airstrikes inside Syria to stop the smuggling of weapons and to destroy Syrian chemical weapons caches. It has rarely officially acknowledged those strikes.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIsraeli ground forces overtly crossed into Syria for the first time in half a century, according to two officials.ImageIsraeli troops in the buffer zone with Syria, in the Golan Heights on Sunday.Credit...Atef Safadi/EPA, via ShutterstockIsraeli ground forces advanced beyond the demilitarized zone on the Israel-Syria border over the weekend, marking their first overt entry into Syrian territory since the 1973 October War, according to two Israeli officials speaking anonymously to discuss sensitive developments.The Israeli deployment came amid a successful push by rebel groups in Syria to drive President Bashar al-Assad out of power and out of the country, prompting neighboring states to brace for more regional instability created by his sudden fall and flight.Israeli forces took control of the mountain summit of Mount Hermon on the Syrian side of the border, as well as several other locations deemed essential for stabilizing control of the area.Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military chief of staff, appeared to confirm on Saturday night that Israeli forces had gone beyond a demilitarized buffer zone in the Golan Heights, saying Israel had “deployed troops into Syrian territory,” although he did not elaborate further.Israel has been covertly operating in Syria for many years amid its current conflict with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group that had fought in Syria in support of Mr. al-Assad’s now-toppled government.More recently, the Israeli military has been more explicit about striking sites and people there, saying it was targeting Hezbollah’s supply lines. But the deployment of ground troops beyond the demilitarized zone in Syria marks a significant shift in policy as the first overt entry of Israeli military forces into Syrian territory since the 1974 cease-fire agreement that officially ended the last war between Israel and Syria.The Israeli Air Force over the weekend was also striking targets in Syria to destroy government military assets that could fall into the hands of rebel forces and are considered strategic threats by Israel, the two officials said.These Syrian military assets had posed a risk to Israel previously, one that could now be exacerbated by extremist elements among the rebels who could seize control and use them against Israel, the officials said.The targets included small stockpiles of chemical weapons, primarily mustard gas and VX gas, which remained in Syrian possession despite prior agreements to disarm, according to the officials. The Israeli military also targeted radar-equipped batteries and vehicles of Russian-made air defense missiles, as well as stockpiles of Scud missiles, according to the two officials.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel announced on Sunday that he had ordered troops to “take over the buffer zone” between Israel and Syria and said Israeli forces had taken up military posts abandoned by Syrian troops, without specifying whether they had entered Syrian territory.“We gave the Israeli army the order to take over these positions to ensure that no hostile force embeds itself right next to the border of Israel,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “This is a temporary defensive position until a suitable arrangement is found.”Avichay Adraee, an Israeli military spokesman, on Sunday announced a curfew in five Syrian villages in the buffer zone, ordering residents to remain home “until further notice.”The Israeli military said it was “not interfering with the internal events in Syria.” But it added that its forces would “continue to operate as long as necessary in order to preserve the buffer zone and defend Israel and its civilians.”The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an independent monitor, said Israeli tanks and armored vehicles had been deployed in Quneitra, a region in the Golan Heights bordering Israel, Lebanon and Jordan.Israeli officials and analysts have voiced concern that the fall of Mr. al-Assad’s government could empower militant groups who seek to carry out attacks against Israel. But while Mr. Netanyahu insisted that the deployment was temporary, it could also raise concerns that Israel might try to capitalize on the instability in Syria.On Saturday night, the Israeli military said its forces had helped rebuff “armed individuals” who attacked a United Nations observation post near Hader in southern Syria. The United Nations peacekeeping agency said “unidentified armed people” had been spotted near the site, including 20 who went inside.Israel captured the Golan Heights during the Middle East war of 1967 and annexed much of the territory in 1981. The rest is controlled by Syria. Most of the world views this area as Israeli-occupied Syrian territory, though Donald J. Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty there in 2019 during his first term as president.Government soldiers put up little resistance when the rebels stormed Damascus, video shows.VideoA poster of the ousted president, Bashar al-Assad, hung in an abandoned military checkpoint.CreditCredit...Associated PressFor some 13 years of Syria’s civil war, government soldiers battled rebels along multiple front lines. But videos show that when the rebels stormed Damascus, the capital, on Sunday to cap their lightning offensive across the country, Syrian government soldiers appeared to put up little fight.One video from early Sunday showed an abandoned military checkpoint in Damascus. Empty chairs sat in front and clothing littered the floor of the small building, which still bore a large poster of the since-ousted president, Bashar al-Assad.Other unverified videos circulated on social media, purporting to show soldiers stripping off their uniforms, some in the dead of night. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, reported seeing the same.The scenes came against the backdrop of accounts from other cities in Syria, where soldiers reportedly did little to repel the rebel advance over the past 12 days.Syria’s military is made up largely of unwilling conscripts, poorly paid soldiers who were forced into mandatory military service.Even in past years of the civil war when they were backed by Syrian and Russian airstrikes — along with help from Iranian proxy militias — many defected, unwilling to fight and die for the Assad government.ImageSmoke billows near Mezzeh Air Base in Damascus on Sunday.Credit...Getty Images/Getty ImagesHowever, it was only last week, as much of the foreign support diminished, that the true weakness of Syria’s military became starkly apparent.Before the surprise Nov. 27 offensive, Syria’s civil war had been largely frozen for more than four years. Analysts say that the Assad government in recent years had done little to bolster the military, confident that it had already dealt a deafening blow to the opposition.Last Wednesday, as rebels were sweeping across the country’s northwest, Mr. al-Assad ordered salaries for his forces to be increased by 50 percent.But it was already too late.Days later, Mr. Assad was gone.Photos from the city of Homs showed soldiers in civilian clothing, being detained by rebels. Military helicopters were abandoned on tarmacs, and the road to Damascus was lined with burned Syrian military vehicles, their troops nowhere to be found.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSyria’s army was hollowing out long before the rebels’ advance.ImageAbandoned tanks lined up at Mezzeh Air Base after Syrian forces deserted their posts on Sunday in Damascus.Credit...Ali Haj Suleiman/Getty ImagesFor years, Syrian soldiers have been complaining on Facebook about their bosses. Commanders who took bribes in exchange for leave. Leaders who ordered soldiers to loot. Officers who stole their troops’ food or got drunk on the job.After 13 years of a grueling civil war that devastated Syria, that corrosion came back to haunt the regime.Rebels on Sunday swept into the capital, Damascus, as President Bashar al-Assad fled the country his family had ruled for decades.Multiple factors, including preparation by the main rebel coalition and Mr. al-Assad’s sudden abandonment by his closest allies, contributed to his fall. But the internal deterioration of Mr. al-Assad’s own military meant that when he needed his troops most, many chose to strip off their uniforms and get out of the rebels’ way.Last month, after the rebels burst out of the country’s northwest and began a lightning march south, a soldier from one embattled unit posted an anonymous plea to his commander in chief.“The battalion leaders fled and left the troops and officers to their fate,” the soldier wrote, as documented by Gregory Waters, a Syria researcher, in a recent newsletter. The soldier said that he had lost dozens of comrades.“We had to tell their families that they died because there are traitorous officers whom we cannot hold accountable,” he wrote.Mr. al-Assad’s fall has sent shock waves across the Middle East, partly because his family had led Syria for so long and partly because it appeared for several years that he had effectively won the war with the support of his main backers, Russia, Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.But even as Mr. al-Assad consolidated his control over most of the country and its people, life for most Syrians kept getting worse.The United States and other countries imposed punishing sanctions, hobbling Syria’s economy, and the value of its currency plummeted, reducing many Syrians who had considered themselves middle class to poverty.This cut into the lives of Mr. al-Assad’s staunchest supporters, including military families that had lost relatives defending his government and had expected some reward for their service — what Emile Hokayem, a Middle East analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, called a “victory dividend.”“If you win something, you expect something to be better for you after your victory,” he said. “But they won and things got worse.”Over time, that undermined his military from within.In his newsletter looking at the long-term decline of the Syrian military, Mr. Waters wrote that a combination of corruption, desertions, failed internal reforms and a dependence on foreign forces had created a personnel shortage that left Mr. al-Assad’s army weak.To keep Syria’s senior officers from getting killed, for example, Russia had advised the country to keep them away from the front lines, leaving more junior officers to lead soldiers in the field. That practice spread, and when the rebels attacked, “senior leadership seemed nowhere to be found,” Mr. Waters wrote.ImageAnti-government fighters parading in the streets of Hama, Syria, after forces captured the central city on Friday.Credit...Bakr Al Kassem/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAs the rebels advanced — first taking Aleppo, Syria’s commercial hub, followed by Hama, another major city — they encountered little resistance, probably because senior officers failed to organize the defenses, and so individual units collapsed, Mr. Waters said.In their blitz south to Damascus, a trip of about 200 miles, the rebels appear to have done their most significant fighting around the central city of Homs, but it was short-lived.While Mr. al-Assad’s forces had been weakening, the rebels in northern Syria had been getting organized. The group that led the rebel advance, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, had for years been the de facto government of Idlib Province, which is home to many displaced Syrians and abuts the Turkish border. The group taxed the booming cross-border trade, apparently routing much of its profit into military preparation.After the fighters began their advance, allied with other rebel groups directly backed by Turkey, their rapid advances created their own momentum.“Momentum is not about capabilities or the number of soldiers you have on the ground, it is about psychology, and that is where the rebels achieved their greatest effect,” Mr. Hokayem said. “There was no narrative on the other side, no coherence.”Also key to the rebels’ advance was Mr. al-Assad’s effective abandonment by the foreign forces who had helped him throughout the civil war, said Yezid Sayigh, senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut.Russia had diverted its attention and some of its military assets from Syria to its invasion of Ukraine, so it was in no place to save him. Iran’s economy had been weakened by sanctions, and its long-running shadow conflict with Israel had intensified. Hezbollah had lost so many commanders and fighters in its own war with Israel before reaching a cease-fire last month that it, too, had little aid to offer Mr. al-Assad.That left only his military, as depleted as it was.“This was not a strong army that was ready to fight anymore, and it was clear to them that their president had failed them in one key aspect, which was to secure foreign support,” Mr. Sayigh said. “At that point, morale was just irretrievable, for the rank and file generally and for a fair number of senior officers as well.”Russian state media rapidly changed the tone of its Syria coverage on Sunday, as the Kremlin’s focus shifted from keeping its ally in power to salvaging Russia’s military bases in the country. Previous references to rebel forces as violent fundamentalists were replaced by much more neutral terms by Sunday evening. “Russia has always supported a political solution to the Syrian crisis,” said the anchor of Russia’s flagship “Vesti” evening news show.U.S. airstrikes struck dozens of Islamic State camps and leaders in central Syria on Sunday in one of the largest military strikes in months, the United States Central Command said in a statement, adding that 75 “targets” had been hit. The statement said that the U.S. would continue to target the terrorist group throughout the “dynamic period in Syria.”“There should be no doubt — we will not allow ISIS to reconstitute and take advantage of the current situation in Syria,” Gen.

One of the officials said the initial messages were meant to tell the groups “what not to do.”One of the messages that the United States passed through the Turkish government was that the rebel groups should not allow militants with the Islamic State to participate in their offensive against the Assad government.The groups responded through the Turks with assurances that they had no intention of allowing the Islamic State to be part of their movement, according to U.S. and Turkish officials briefed on the messages.The messages have been passed to the Turks using diplomatic, intelligence and military channels.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence and diplomatic matters.In his public remarks from the White House on Sunday, Mr. Biden said the U.S. would not allow the Islamic State to take advantage of any power vacuum following Mr. Assad’s fall.The broader debate within the Biden administration over engaging more directly with the groups centers on their past behavior and connections to extremists. It also encompasses ongoing assessments by U.S. intelligence analysts and administration policymakers of whether the groups have, or are prepared to, substantially change their ways to address the concerns of the United States and its allies in the region about their terrorist affiliations.The rebel groups have united under the leadership of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or H.T.S., which the United States branded a foreign terrorist organization during the Trump administration.H.T.S. is a former Al Qaeda affiliate, but it broke with the older group years ago and came to dominate the last stronghold of Syria’s opposition.Once seen as one of the rebellion’s most powerful extremist factions, the group later tried to play down its radical aspects and focused on building something like a civilian government — albeit an authoritarian and extremist one — in its patch of territory.U.S. intelligence agencies and top officials in the Biden administration are still in the process of evaluating H.T.S. and its leader, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, who is eager for legitimacy and has mounted what one senior U.S. official characterized as a “charm offensive” aimed at allaying concerns about their intentions and past affiliations.The way one senior U.S. official put it, “A charm offensive might mean that people are turning over a new leaf and they think differently than they used to so you should hear them out. On the other hand, you should be cautious because charm offensives can sometimes be misleading.”The official continued, “We have to think about it. We have to watch their behavior and we need to do some indirect messaging and see what comes of that.”U.S. officials said the Biden administration is allowed to talk to H.T.S. and its leader even though they are on the terrorist list, but the administration cannot provide them with material support.While the Biden administration has so far stopped short of directly talking to H.T.S., it has been working closely and directly with the U.S. military’s main counterterrorism partner in Syria, a Kurdish-led militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F.According to U.S. officials, the administration encouraged and provided intelligence support to the S.D.F. for operations by the group to take control of Syrian territory in eastern Syria, including the cities of Deir al Zour and Abu Kamal.The officials said the operations were meant to ensure that the Islamic State couldn’t take advantage of the situation and seize the areas as Syrian government forces withdrew.According to a U.S. official, the message that the United States sent to the S.D.F. was, “If the regime vacates territory, it’s going to go to somebody, so you should fill the vacuum yourself rather than let ISIS fill into that vacuum.”Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told state television that the fall of the Syrian government was a setback for Iran’s militant allies, known as the axis of resistance, but that it would not destroy it. He said that Iran will continue to support and stand with the militant groups, and even without Syria he said the resistance “will find its way.” He added, “It has been able to arm and find its way and it will do so again.” Araghchi said he wasn’t convinced that Iran had entirely lost Syria, signaling a willingness to establish ties with its future leaders.The Assad family’s legacy is one of savage oppression.ImagePortraits of Hafez al-Assad, left, and his son Bashar al-Assad, who succeeded him in power, at a hotel in Damascus.Credit...Marko Djurica/ReutersOver decades, ghastly, chilling images from Syria have cemented the Assad family’s legacy of savagely oppressing the country’s population.In 1982, photos showed the pulverized central city of Hama after the regime bombed and bulldozed a Muslim Brotherhood uprising, leaving up to 20,000 people dead.In 2013, images emerged of hundreds of ghostly pale bodies in a rebellious Damascus suburb, victims of one of the government’s chemical weapons attacks. Many of the dead were children.That same year, a former military photographer smuggled thousands of photographs out of Syria documenting how political prisoners had been starved, beaten and subjected to brutal torture — their eyes gouged out or their genitals mangled.“These people did not care; the leadership cared nothing about the Syrian people,” said Andrew J. Tabler, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a former U.S. government official on security issues. “They launched Scud missiles against their own people — who does that? — while the chemical weapons were a sign of just how far they would go to hold on to power.”Syrians sometimes said the Assads were like the fictional Corleone crime family, but with secret police networks attached — a ruthless clan of brothers and cousins who dominated the political system, the military, the economy and even the exports of illegal drugs. Much of the country lived in fear.“They were not running a country with a history of 5,000 years of civilization,” said Ayman Abdel Nour, a former college friend of President Bashar al-Assad who joined the opposition out of disgust over the lack of reform. “They were running it like the Mafia, as if it was a private estate, the whole country was their backyard inherited from their father.”After World War II, Syria was known as the most unstable country in the Middle East, with at least eight coups carried out from the end of French colonial rule in 1946 until 1970.Hafez al-Assad, an air force officer, put an end to that after he seized power that year, rebuilding the country as a Soviet-style, single-party police state that exploited sectarian differences among Syria’s mosaic of religious and ethnic groups to retain power.He set about turning the country into a power to be reckoned with in the Middle East, launching the 1973 war against Israel in conjunction with Egypt and exerting control over neighboring Lebanon and the Palestinian political leadership there to end its long-running civil war. In power for 30 years, he built fearsome, overlapping internal security agencies, with thousands of victims disappearing into his prisons.When he died in 2000, the government changed the Constitution to lower the age needed to be president to 34 from 40 so that his son Bashar could take over. Bookish, shy, socially awkward and trained as an eye surgeon, Bashar became the designated heir only after his swashbuckling older brother, Basil, died.Bashar, with his glamorous, Syrian-British wife, Asma, announced plans for political and social reform that he soon abandoned when he realized it would require dismantling his father’s legacy. “To both father and son, making concessions was not acceptable,” said Randa Slim, a senior fellow with the Middle East Institute in Washington. “Eventually that is what brought Bashar down.”In 2011, amid the uprisings across the Middle East, Syria’s large youth population rose up against Mr. al-Assad, incensed at the lack of democracy, jobs and overall freedom.The violent government crackdown transformed what had been nonviolent street demonstrations into a bloody civil war.“Bashar came to power with many doubting that he had the will to rule Syria with the kind of iron fist that his father did,” said Firas Maksad, a Syria expert and the director of strategic outreach at the Middle East Institute. “He had a chip on his shoulder and was out to prove that he, in fact, could be his father’s son. And in some ways, he ended up exceeding his father’s brutality.”The Assads had built a power base from their community of Alawites, a minority sect that’s an offshoot of Shiite Islam. His supporters adopted the slogan “Assad or we burn the country.” Millions of refugees fled Syria to surrounding countries, while an estimated 500,000 people were killed or went missing.But Bashar was less shrewd than his father. As the rebels, dominated by Sunni Muslim jihadist groups, seemed on the verge of overthrowing him in 2015, he turned to Iran, Hezbollah and Russia to prop up his government.For a time, they did. He proved unable to manipulate them, however, and his obstinate personality soon alienated his allies. With Iran and Hezbollah severely weakened by their conflicts with Israel, and Russia concentrating on its war in Ukraine, there was no force willing or able to prop him up anymore. His own army melted away, even as he made a last, desperate attempt to shore up their support by ordering a 50 percent pay raise last week.The rebel forces that grew out of the civil war finally managed to overthrow him, opening many of the notorious prisons in which his family’s government had for years jailed, tortured and executed political prisoners. The rebels themselves appeared surprised by the speed and ease with which the seemingly entrenched Assad dynasty finally crumbled.Still, after more than a decade of fighting, Syria’s main cities lie in ruins and the male population between the ages of 20 and 40 has been decimated. “Both the infrastructure and the human capital are totally destroyed,” said Mr. Abdel Nour.",
