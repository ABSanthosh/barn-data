America and its partners are caught in a spiral of distrust.President Trump, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, announcing plans for the Air Force’s new F-47 fighter in the Oval Office last week.Credit...Haiyun Jiang for The New York TimesMarch 31, 2025Updated 7:41 p.m. ETThe F-35, a fifth-generation fighter, was developed in partnership with eight countries, making it a model of international cooperation. When President Trump introduced a sixth-generation aircraft, the F-47, he praised its strengths — and said the version sold to allies would be deliberately downgraded.That made sense, Mr. Trump said last week, “because someday, maybe they’re not our allies.”For many countries wedded to the United States, his remark confirmed a related conclusion: that America can no longer be trusted. Even nations not yet directly affected can see where things are heading, as Mr. Trump threatens allies’ economies, their defense partnerships and even their sovereignty.For now, they are negotiating to minimize the pain from blow after blow, including a broad round of tariffs expected in April. But at the same time, they are pulling back. Preparing for intimidation to be a lasting feature of U.S. relations, they are trying to go their own way.A few examples:Canada made a $4.2 billion deal with Australia this month to develop cutting-edge radar and announced that it was in talks to take part in the European Union’s military buildup.Portugal and other NATO nations are reconsidering plans to buy F-35s, fearing American control over parts and software.Negotiations over a free trade and technology deal between the European Union and India have suddenly accelerated after years of delays.Brazil is not only increasing trade with China, it’s doing it in China’s currency, sidelining the dollar.In several countries, including Poland, South Korea and Australia, discussions about whether to build or secure access to nuclear weapons are now commonplace.Some degree of distancing from the United States had already been in motion as other countries became wealthier, more capable and less convinced that American centrality would be permanent. But the past few months of Trump 2.0 have supercharged the process.ImageThe U.S.S. Alexandria, a nuclear-powered submarine, docking at a South Korean naval base in February.Credit...Yonhap/EPA, via ShutterstockHistory and psychology help explain why. Few forces have such a powerful, long-lasting impact on geopolitics as distrust, according to social scientists who study international relations. It has repeatedly poisoned negotiations in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It kept Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union burning for decades.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
