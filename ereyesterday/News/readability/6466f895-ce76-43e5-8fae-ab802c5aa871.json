  "text": "Trump thanked Iran for giving an early notice about their attack on US base in Qatar.President Donald Trump hinted that he is not planning any counterattack on Iran after Iran attacked US base in Qatar in retaliation against US' Operation Midnight Hammer, which destroyed Iran's nuclear plants, as he called for peace on both the Iranian and Israeli sides. Trump said 14 missiles were fired, 13 were knocked down, and one was set free as it was headed in a non-threatening direction. \"I am pleased to report that NO Americans were harmed, and hardly any damage was done,\" Trump said, adding that the most important part of the attack was that Itran got it all out of their system and there will be hopefully 'no further HATE'. \"I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured. Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same,\" Trump said. President Donald Trump was briefed about the attack that Iran launched on the US base in Qatar Monday in retaliation of US dropping bombs on its nuclear sites but the president does not plan to take any further action against Iran, New York Post reported, citing a military official. \"As long as it stands, Trump has no intention of retaliating for the 'failed retaliation,'\" the source said, suggesting that tensions in the Middle East will soon de-escalate following Saturday's US strike on three Iranian nuclear facilities.Iran coordinated attack with Qatar, informed USThough Qatar condemned the attack and confirmed that they intercepted the missiles, they 'allowed itself to be targeted to save face', according to reports. Before Trump announced that it was a coordinated attack, US media widely reported that it was a 'coordinated' attack and Iran is not aiming at any escalation. New York Times reported that Ira informed Qatar before the attack and gave advanced notice that attacks were coming to minimize casualties. NYT cited three Iranian officials who said that Iran symbolically needed to strike back at the US but at the same time carry it out in a way that allowed all sides an exit ramp.",
