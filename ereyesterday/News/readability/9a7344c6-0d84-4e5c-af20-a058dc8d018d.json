Subscribe now Over the last seven years, the Indian government has consistently fallen short of fully utilizing the budgeted and additional expenditures approved through supplementary grants, using on average around 80% of the total available funds each year, according to Goldman Sachs. The shortfall has narrowed post-pandemic, when the government overshot its budgeted subsidies expenditure to cover rising food prices, it said.The investment bank projected the government's public expenditure to shrink further in the coming years, slowing to 3.2% of the GDP in fiscal year 2025-26.That fiscal discipline would \"remain a drag on growth in the next fiscal year,\" it said, suggesting that \"the fastest growth pace in public capex is behind us ... overall, there is not much room to boost welfare spending.\"Economic slowdownThe world's fastest growing major economy has seen a growth downturn. India has been steadily cutting its full year real GDP forecasts after economic growth missed expectations in the quarter ending September, when its grew by 5.4% — its slowest expansion in nearly two years.The government has trimmed its economic growth outlook for the current fiscal year to the slowest level in four years, after three rounds of cuts brought estimates to 6.4% earlier this month from 7.2% in October.For the next fiscal year, Nomura analysts said the government might set a nominal GDP growth target of 10.3%, up from 9.7% for the current fiscal year ending March 2025.Still, hopes that Sitharaman will deliver a large fiscal package to pull the economy out of its recent soft patch in the upcoming budget are likely to be disappointed, Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics said in a note.While some additional \"accommodative tax and spending measures are on the cards,\" they are likely to be \"piecemeal,\" Shah added.Monetary easingThe Reserve Bank of India has held the interest rate steady since February in 2023, however, a sharper-than-anticipated slowdown in India's economic growth has made the central bank's task tougher.With the rupee hitting record lows against the greenback, any cuts to the bank's policy rate could spark a further rise in domestic inflation, putting further pressure on the currency and likely triggering capital outflows.India's consumer price inflation has fallen within the central bank's tolerance ceiling of 6%, coming in at 5.22% in December and 5.48% in November — it had breached the upper limit in October — offering the RBI some room to lower rates.The RBI faces a \"tough choice,\" said Tanvee Gupta Jain, chief India economist at UBS, adding that she expected a \"shallow monetary easing cycle\" of about 75 basis points, starting the February policy meeting.The central bank, however, said last month that monetary conditions could remain tight for some time while it looked at further curbing inflationary pressures.India-watchers have also been on tenterhooks over possible actions by President Donald Trump, who had floated the idea of universal tariffs during his campaign trail.With a trade surplus of nearly $42 billion with the U.S., India faces heightened scrutiny under Trump's policy focus on reducing trade deficits.The U.S. trade policy framework under Trump's second presidency could strengthen the dollar and Treasury yields, keeping the U.S. interest rates elevated for longer. That has complicated the policy decisions for central banks in Asia, including the RBI, as boosting growth by loosening policy would mean widening the rate differentials.Disinvestment goalOne part of the budget that investors will be focused on is the government's divestment of stakes in state-run entities.India is looking to cut its disinvestment and asset monetization goals by 40% — or to less than 300 billion rupees ($3.47 billion) from 500 billion rupees — for the current financial year, domestic media outlet The Economic Times reported earlier this month.Divestment receipts have \"lagged this year\" and stood at 90 billion rupees compared to the government budget estimate of 500 billion rupees, said UBS' Jain.She expects the government to lower the target \"towards 300 billion\" rupees for the next fiscal year.",
