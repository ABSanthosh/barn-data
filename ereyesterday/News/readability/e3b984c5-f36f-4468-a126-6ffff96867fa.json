  "text": "During a period of public comment, PennDOT has released the possible plans for improving multiple intersections along East Berlin Road in Reading Township.The plans, which focus separately on the intersections of East Berlin Road and Stoney Point Road and then East Berlin Road and Peepytown Road, each have multiple possible improvements listed.Previously reported: Could East Berlin Road get a roundabout? Open house planned for intersection improvementsFor the intersection of East Berlin Road and Stoney Point Road, there are three possible alternatives, which range from an estimated $9.9 million to $13.8 million:Alternative 1: Construct a roundabout at the existing intersection.A map shows a proposed alternative for intersection improvements at the intersection of East Berlin Road and Stony Point Road in Reading Township.In the first alternative for Stoney Point Road, the proposal sees a roundabout placed in the existing location of the intersection.Due to the change in alignment required in this proposal, the plans appear to show at least one home south of the intersection would be required to be removed to facilitate this version of proposal.This proposal shows limited improvements to the Kimberly Lane intersection.Alternative 2: Construct a split intersection with roundabouts east and west of the existing intersection and realign Stoney Point Road.A map shows a proposed alternative for intersection improvements at the intersection of East Berlin Road and Stony Point Road in Reading Township.In what appears to be one of the more complicated proposals, alternative 2 is known as the \"Dual Roundabout\" proposal.This proposal would see Stoney Point Road separated before and after the existing intersection, with the southern approach terminating with a roundabout at East Berlin Road and the northern approach terminating at a roundabout with Kimberly Lane and East Berlin Road.The western roundabout is shifted to the west into a small forested area between houses, in order to avoid the impacts to houses seen in alternative 1.Short roads ending in cul-de-sacs would provide access to existing homes along Stoney Point Road.Alternative 3: Construct a roundabout west of the existing intersection and realign Stoney Point Road to the west.A map shows a proposed alternative for intersection improvements at the intersection of East Berlin Road and Stony Point Road in Reading Township.In the third alternative for the Stoney Point Road intersection, PennDOT proposes realigning the intersection to the west, along with improvements to the Kimberly Lane intersection.Short roads terminating in cul-de-sacs would maintain access to homes that would previously have been along Stoney Point Road.The alternative is known as the \"Shifted Roundabout\" alternative, as it would see the road realigned to the west, somewhat similar to alternative 2.In realigning the roundabout to the west, the proposal would have less impact on existing homes, placing the roundabout in the space of existing trees rather than requiring the demolition of a home as seen in the first alternative.For the intersection of East Berlin Road and Peepytown Road, there are four possible alternatives, ranging from an expected cost of $1.4 million to $4.7 million dollars.Alternative 1: Construct a roundabout at the existing intersection.A map shows a proposed alternative for intersection improvements at the intersection of East Berlin Road and Peepytown Road in Reading Township.In the first of four alternatives to the Peepytown Road intersection, a roundabout is created at the existing intersection.in doing this, the approach of Peepytown Road to the south would be realigned to the east to provide a straighter approach, with a driveway connecting to an existing driveway nearby.Alternative 2: Construct a roundabout west of the existing intersection and realign Peepytown Road.A map shows a proposed alternative for intersection improvements at the intersection of East Berlin Road and Peepytown Road in Reading Township.The second proposal for the Peepytown Road intersection would see a \"shifted roundabout,\" which would move all approaches to the intersection southwest of where they currently meet.In doing so, this alternative appears to show lesser impact on surrounding residential properties in creating a roundabout than the first alternative.Alternative 3: Realign the existing intersection to the west, add Route 234 right turn lane and realign Peepytown Road.A map shows a proposed alternative for intersection improvements at the intersection of East Berlin Road and Peepytown Road in Reading Township.In a less radical change to the intersection, the third alternative would see the intersection remaining as a single stop sign from the Peepytown Road approach, but would realign the intersection to the west to improve sightlines.Alternative 4: Add Route 234 right turn lane at the existing intersection and achieve sight distance.A map shows a proposed alternative for intersection improvements at the intersection of East Berlin Road and Peepytown Road in Reading Township.In the most minor proposed revision of the intersection, Alternative 4 simply suggests adding a right-turn lane to East Berlin Road for traffic turning onto Peepytown Road.Both plans are currently in the \"alternatives analysis phase,\" according to PennDOT. Construction is proposed to begin in 2027, and be completed by 2029.An open house was set for Thursday, May 8, 2025, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. in the Reading Township Community Center along South Firehouse Alley in Hampton.The online display of plans, as well as public comment period for the plans, runs from May 1 to May 30, 2025. PennDOT said that, during the public comment period, the public was encouraged to respond with any questions or concerns.This article originally appeared on Hanover Evening Sun: PennDOT eyeing roundabouts in East Berlin Road improvements",
