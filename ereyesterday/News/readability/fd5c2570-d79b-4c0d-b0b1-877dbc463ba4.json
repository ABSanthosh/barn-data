  "text": "Five takeaways from Pete Hegseth's confirmation hearingWatch key moments from Pete Hegseth's confirmation hearingPete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick for defence secretary, cleared his first hurdle on the way to confirmation: a long - and at times tense - hearing before the Senate's Armed Services Committee. For more than four hours on Tuesday, Hegseth faced questions about his ability to run the Defence Department, including its three million employees and $849bn (£695bn) budget. And although he was grilled by Democrats over accusations of sexual assault, infidelity and drinking in the workplace, he appears all but certain to be confirmed to the role after no Republicans came out against him.This was underscored later on Tuesday when Joni Ernst, one Republican who had been seen as a potential roadblock to his nomination, said she would support him. Here's a look at the five main takeaways from Hegseth's testimony. A 'warrior ethos' From the very start of his testimony, Hegseth, a military veteran, emphasised what he called a \"warrior culture\", vowing to return the focus of the Defence Department to the strength of America's military.\"Warfighting, lethality, meritocracy, standards, and readiness. That's it. That is my job,\" he said in his opening statements. As the hearing continued, Hegseth was critical of policies he felt harmed the efficiency and \"lethality\" of the military, namely efforts aimed at racial and gender diversity. \"This is not a time for equity,\" he said, adding that he opposes quotas, which he claims hurt morale. Getty ImagesWomen in the militaryLack of experience or 'breath of fresh air'Hegseth, who at 44 would be the youngest defence secretary in decades, also answered questions about his preparedness to run the defence department, a sprawling agency.The former Fox News host described himself as a \"change agent\", saying \"it's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm.\"Some Republicans deemed Hegseth's lack of experience a strength. \"I just want to say for all the talk of experience and not coming from the same cocktail parties that permanent Washington is used to, you are a breath of fresh air,\" Senator Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, said. Getty ImagesMany of the toughest questions came from Democratic women, who grilled Hegseth on his views of womenA graduate of Princeton and Harvard universities, Hegseth was an infantry platoon leader in Guantanamo Bay and Iraq, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. Hegseth, also a former Fox News TV host, has military experience in Afghanistan as well.Still, Democrats pressed Hegseth on his qualifications for the top military job. Reporting from US media found that Hegseth's tenures at the helm of two non-profit veterans groups ended in financial disarray. Combat veteran Tammy Duckworth focused on whether Hegseth had ever supervised an audit. \"Senator, in both of the organisations I ran, we were always completely fiscally responsible,\" Hegseth began, before Duckworth cut in. \"Yes or no? Did you lead an audit? Do you not know this answer?\" Duckworth said.What wasn't askedSome experts told the BBC they were most struck by how little Hegseth talked about how he'd handle the job's military complexities. Aside from brief mentions of China and the war in Ukraine and Russia, senators did not ask Hegseth specifically about current conflicts, and other potential military adversaries and strategic rivals.Those fundamental issues were mostly \"crowded out\" by the questions about Hegseth's character and competence, said Mara Karlin, former assistant secretary of defense for strategy, plans, and capabilities. \"What's astonishing about the hearing is just how little focus there has been on the bread and butter of what the secretary of defence has to do, which is protect the nation, and ensure you have a military capable of winning conflicts,\" Karlin said. Sexual assault or smear campaignA 2017 accusation of sexual assault in Monterey, California, which surfaced soon after Trump tapped him for the Pentagon role, came up repeatedly. According to a police report, an unnamed woman said Hegseth took her phone and blocked the door when she tried to leave his hotel room before sexually assaulting her. Hegseth has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer acknowledged Hegseth had paid an undisclosed amount to stay quiet about the incident.On Tuesday, Hegseth mainly went on the offensive, decrying a \"coordinated smear campaign\" orchestrated by the left-wing media. \"They want to destroy me.\" But at other times in the hearing, Hegseth responded to questions about his conduct with passionate references to his Christian faith. \"I am not a perfect person, but redemption is real,\" he said.",
