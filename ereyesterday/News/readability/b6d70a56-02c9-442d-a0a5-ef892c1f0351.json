  "text": "25 years after the legendary \"Joe Canadian\" beer commercial first captivated audiences, a bold new version has emerged, this time, not to sell beer but to celebrate Canadian pride. As the speaker steps up to the microphone, a massive maple leaf flag ripples on the screen behind him, setting the tone for a powerful homage to the nation's spirit.Created by an anonymous group of Canadian creatives, the video sees actor Jeff Douglas reprise his iconic role as the passionate everyman, delivering a powerful tribute to Canada’s identity. Though his hair may be a little greyer, his message remains as resolute as ever: Canada will not bow to the United States.“They mistake our modesty for meekness, our kindness for consent, our nation for another star on their flag and our love of a hot cheesy poutine with their love of a hot cheesy Putin,\" Douglas declared in the video.\"This is the birthplace of peanut butter and ketchup chips and yoga pants. It is the land of universal healthcare and the bench-clearing brawl, of innovation and optimism and gettin' 'er done,\" he continued.\"Are we perfect? No. But we are not the 51st anything,\" he added.With soaring orchestral music and a surge of patriotic pride, the new version reimagines the iconic 2000 Molson Canadian ad. In it, \"Joe Canadian\" confronts national stereotypes, shifting from reserved to resolute before delivering the original’s powerful declaration:\"Canada is the second largest landmass! The first nation of hockey! And the best part of North America! My name is Joe! And I am Canadian!\"This release is particularly significant amidst growing Canada-US tensions. The video delivers a sharp rebuttal to President Donald Trump’s recent suggestion that Canada could become the 51st US state—a remark that sparked outrage among Canadians. With unwavering defiance, the ad makes its stance clear that: \"We are not 51st anything.\"The updated version showcases prominent Canadians, including Terry Fox and Gordon Lightfoot, alongside Canada's response to adversity. \"We are the first to unite in the crisis, the first to build bridges – not walls – and the first to stand on guard for thee,\" Douglas states in the footage, referencing the national anthem.The production concludes as a unifying message for Canadians, with Douglas expressing, \"We humbly hope it may be something that can help boost Canadian spirits.\"",
