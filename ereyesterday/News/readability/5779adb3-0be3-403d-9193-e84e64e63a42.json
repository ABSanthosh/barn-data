Projectiles sent by Iran to strike Israel were visible from various locations across Cyprus on Friday and Saturday night.\"It is not possible for the EU to claim a geopolitical role, to see all these developments and for there not to be at the very least a convening of the Council of Foreign Ministers,\" Christodoulides told journalists.Cyprus has offered to assist in the evacuation of third-party nationals from the region, and has called on all sides to refrain from actions which could escalate the conflict.(Reporting by Michele Kambas; Editing by Jan Harvey, David Holmes and Susan Fenton)",
