  "text": "President Donald Trump is considering whether to launch a military strike against Iran as he demands the country's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, \"surrender\" in Tehran's conflict with Israel, current and former administration officials told NBC News on Tuesday.A strike by the United States is one option among a range that Trump is weighing after meeting with his top national security advisors in the Situation Room on Tuesday afternoon, the officials told NBC.The meeting came hours after Trump warned Khamenei that the U.S. knows \"exactly\" where he is \"hiding.\"\"Our patience is wearing thin,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\"He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,\" Trump wrote shortly after declaring \"total control\" over Iran's airspace.\"But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers,\" he wrote.Trump in a subsequent post made clear what he does want from Iran: \"UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!\"U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One after departing early from the the G7 summit in Canada to return to Washington, June 17, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Trump administration has insisted that the U.S. is not directly involved in what Israel called a preemptive strike against Iran on Friday, which kicked off five days of missile fire between the two regional powers.But Trump's latest comments suggest the U.S. is now at least willing to threaten direct military intervention as it backs Israel's effort to bring Tehran to heel.The U.S. president's threat against Khamenei came two days after news outlets reported that Trump had vetoed a plan by Israel to assassinate the ayatollah.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday downplayed his reported disagreement with Trump over Khamenei, saying, \"I wouldn't rush to conclusions.\"The New York Times reported Monday that Trump is weighing whether to help Israel destroy Iran's underground uranium enrichment facility at Fordo, which could only be accomplished with the U.S.' biggest \"bunker buster\" bomb.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on that report or on other questions about the latest developments in the Israel-Iran conflict.Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei addresses the nation on Iranian state television broadcast in Tehran, Iran on June 13, 2025.Iranian Leader Press Office | Anadolu | Getty ImagesU.S. stocks slid Tuesday as the geopolitical tensions mounted.

The U.S. previously deployed military assets to the region to help Israel shoot down Iranian missiles and projectiles, according to NBC.Trump teed up Tuesday's threat against Khamenei with an earlier social media post declaring, \"We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran.\"Tehran \"had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn't compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured 'stuff,'\" Trump wrote.\"Nobody does it better than the good ol' USA.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump signals escalation in Israel-Iran conflict as he leaves G7 summit earlyAlleged Minnesota gunman to face first-degree murder chargesTrump Organization announces mobile plan, $499 smartphoneAs G7 leaders meet, allies ask: Is Trump with us or against us?Israel claims 'full aerial superiority' over Tehran's skies as strikes wage onG-7 leaders gather in Canada for summit overshadowed by crisis and tariffsEurope is trying to woo Southeast Asia — but it won't win it over the U.S. or ChinaSuspect Vance Boelter apprehended in Minnesota lawmakers shooting caseOn Monday, Trump abruptly returned to Washington, D.C., from Canada, where he had traveled for a meeting of the Group of Seven nations.The leader of one of those nations, French President Emmanuel Macron, had suggested in Alberta that the U.S. would be seeking a ceasefire between Israel and Iran.Trump swiftly rebuked Macron online, calling him \"publicity seeking\" and denying that he had left the G7 summit in search of a ceasefire.\"He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire,\" Trump wrote. \"Stay Tuned!\"This is breaking news.
