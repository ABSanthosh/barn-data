But in the aftermath of President Trump’s decision to impose 25 percent tariffs on most categories of Canadian exports, the mood in Windsor, like all of Canada, was transformed.Mr. Trump’s move has ignited a sense of economic anxiety and anger among Canadians about how they are being treated by their neighbor, ally and best customer. Most are still puzzling over Mr. Trump’s motivations and objectives for the tariffs, as well as his comments about annexing Canada as the 51st state.And as they turned their attention to getting the potentially crippling tariffs, and a 10 percent levy on Canadian oil and gas and some minerals, lifted, politicians, business people and ordinary Canadians say that the relationship between the two countries will never return to what it once was.Flavio Volpe, the head of a Canadian auto-parts maker trade group, said that his members could start shutting down factories in days, and that he feels betrayed by the United States.“We’ve built two societies on the same values,” said Mr. Volpe, who is also a member of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Council on Canada-U.S. Relations. “The man in the White House did a U-turn and drove right over us.”ImageFlavio Volpe, the head of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’​ Association in Canada, said, “The man in the White House did a U-turn and drove right over us.”Credit...Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press, via Associated PressThank you for your patience while we verify access.
