  "text": "A petition calling for the revocation of Elon Musk's Canadian citizenship has garnered more than 250,000 signatures as of Tuesday, accusing the billionaire tech mogul of undermining Canada’s sovereignty. Musk, who holds Canadian citizenship through his mother, Maye Musk, was born in Pretoria, South Africa.The petition, which launched on February 20, claims Musk has engaged in actions contrary to Canada's national interests, alleging that he \"has become a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty.\" It also cites Musk’s support for US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly expressed the desire to annex Canada and incorporate it as the 51st US state.Musk responded to the petition with mockery, posting on his social media platform X that “Canada is not a real country.” (The post is now unavailable)The petition was spearheaded by Canadian federal lawmaker Charlie Angus, a member of the New Democratic Party, who stated that it provides an opportunity for Canadians to voice their concerns over the influence of powerful figures like Musk. \"People like Elon Musk are enemies of our country,\" Angus added.Musk, who also holds US citizenship, is known for his political activities and his ongoing support for Trump. The petition follows Musk's endorsement of Pierre Poilievre, leader of Canada's Conservative Party, as the next prime minister.Under Canadian federal law, citizenship may be revoked in cases of fraud or misrepresentation on immigration applications or if a person serves in a foreign army against Canada. However, petitions presented to Parliament cannot mandate any action, though they may elicit an official government response.As of now, Parliament is suspended until March 24, and the Canadian government has not indicated any immediate action regarding Musk's citizenship.",
