  "text": "Luigi Mangione (Pic coutresy: X/ kodstrangeer)The suspected killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Luigi Mangione was not affiliated with the healthcare provider and possibly selected Brian Thompson due to size and influence, according to a senior police official on Thursday.In a discussion with NBC New York on Thursday, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny revealed that evidence suggests Luigi Mangione was aware of UnitedHealthcare's annual investor conference taking place in New York City.A note discovered on Mangione during his arrest in Pennsylvania contained references to the healthcare organisation, as per AP news agency.\"We have no indication that he was ever a client of United Healthcare, but he does make mention that it is the fifth largest corporation in America, which would make it the largest healthcare organization in America. So that's possibly why he targeted that company,\" said Kenny.Whilst UnitedHealthcare ranks amongst the top 20 US companies by market value, it is not the fifth largest, though it leads as the country's biggest health insurer.Currently detained without bail in Pennsylvania, Mangione was apprehended on Monday at a McDonald's in Altoona, situated 230 miles (about 370 kilometres) from New York City. His legal representative, Thomas Dickey, states that Mangione will plead not guilty and notes the absence of conclusive evidence linking his client to the offence.The arrest occurred five days after Thompson's videotaped shooting outside a Manhattan hotel.According to police, the assailant waited near the hotel hosting the insurer's conference on the morning of December 4. He shot Thompson from behind before escaping by bicycle through Central Park.Mangione is resisting extradition to New York where he faces murder charges for Thompson's death. A hearing is set for December 30.The 26-year-old suspect, found with a \"ghost gun\" matching evidence from the crime scene, faces Pennsylvania charges including unlicensed firearm possession, forgery and providing false identification.An Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland property family, Mangione documented his experiences with severe back pain on social media before undergoing spinal fusion surgery in 2023. He later shared positive updates about reduced pain and improved mobility, encouraging others to consider similar treatment.Police indicated on Wednesday that they are investigating his writings about health issues and criticisms of corporate America and the healthcare system.Kenny revealed in the NBC interview that Mangione's family reported him missing to San Francisco authorities in November.",
