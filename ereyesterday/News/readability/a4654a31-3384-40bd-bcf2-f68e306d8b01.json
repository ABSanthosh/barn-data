  "text": "Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., blames Democrats, former President Joe Biden, and Republican lawmaker Thomas Massie of Kentucky, over the Jeffrey Epstein situation (AP photo)The Congressional upheaval over the Jeffrey Epstein investigation deepened this week as House Speaker Mike Johnson abruptly announced an early end to the legislative session, cutting it short by one day before the scheduled August recess.Johnson displayed visible frustration with reporters at the House GOP's news conference on Tuesday, striking the podium while expressing disbelief over how the Epstein matter derailed proceedings. \"There's no purpose for Congress to push an administration to do something that they're already doing. And so this is for political games,\" he said, quoted by ABC News.Republicans have suspended all legislative activity, effectively advancing the start of their five-week summer break. Johnson blamed Democrats for the disruption, aligning his position with President Donald Trump's recent comments. However, his remarks also appeared directed at critics within his own party. \"Some people seem to enjoy trying to inflict political pain on their own teammates... It's a small, tiny handful, but one in particular is giving me lots of consternation. I don't understand Thomas Massie's motivation. I really don't. I don't know how his mind works,\" ABC News reported him saying.The controversy erupted after the GOP-led Rules Committee adjourned indefinitely on Monday night, just as Democrats moved to force a vote on bipartisan legislation demanding the release of Epstein-related files. Representative Thomas Massie criticised the adjournment and Johnson's leadership. \"People have wanted these files for years. The president's staff, administration, his own children, his vice president have promised that these files would come out, and now we're being told it's a hoax. It just doesn't wash,\" he told ABC News.Massie indicated plans to work with Democrats and a few Republicans to try again in the autumn. \"You don't lose your base over one single thing, but [Trump's] eroding his base. And more importantly, if we don't take the right side of this issue, it's going to cost us votes in the midterms,\" he warned.House Republicans have now cancelled several votes on key legislation, including immigration and clean water bills, citing Democrats' persistent attempts to force votes on Epstein transparency.With House business halted, GOP leaders confirmed the chamber's early departure. Final votes are now scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, with Thursday's votes cancelled.Also read: Trump-Epstein ties under scrutiny- Sexual harassment allegations by Maria Farmer in 1996 resurface; White House reactsIn the Senate, Majority Leader John Thune deflected questions on the Epstein issue, saying, \"I believe the president and the attorney general will make the right decisions there with regard to that.\"White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said she was unaware of any direct discussion with Speaker Johnson but reiterated the president's view: \"If the Department of Justice has credible evidence, they should release it.\"Meanwhile, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer plans to subpoena Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's convicted associate. A committee spokeswoman said, \"Since Ms. Maxwell is in federal prison, the Committee will work with the Department of Justice and Bureau of Prisons to identify a date when Committee can depose her.\"The Justice Department has asked a federal judge to unseal grand jury records related to Epstein, and also plans to interview Maxwell. Trump said he had no knowledge of the move but called it \"appropriate.\"Maxwell’s legal team has objected to the unsealing, requesting access to the grand jury transcripts first. \"We would similarly like to review the grand jury transcripts at issue... in order to craft a response and set out our position to the Court,\" her attorney David Oscar Markus wrote.Maxwell, convicted of sex trafficking in 2022, is currently serving a 20-year sentence. The federal judge overseeing the Justice Department's request indicated a swift ruling is expected, though Maxwell's opposition could complicate the timeline.",
