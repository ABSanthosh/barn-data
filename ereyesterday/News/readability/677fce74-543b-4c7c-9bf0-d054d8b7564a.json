Now, he’s taking his mission a step further by running for mayor in Texas, hoping to bring his vision to life for the people of The Hills, according to naralasetty.org.City’s youngest mayorOriginally from Guntur in Andhra Pradesh, Karthik completed his early education in Delhi before moving to the US to study at Rutgers University. His election would mark a historic moment for The Hills and Texas, as he would be the city’s youngest mayor and the first of Indian descent.Running for office in such a setting has proven challenging. Karthik reports enduring personal attacks and describes the campaign atmosphere as “disheartening and hostile.”“The bullying, personal attacks, and character assassinations I’ve encountered are disappointing, but they strengthen my resolve to focus on what matters: serving the people of The Hills with integrity,” Karthik said.He emphasized his commitment to “bring positive change, listen to all voices, and ensure every resident feels valued.”Karthik’s campaign, he shared, centers around “building an inclusive future where everyone in The Hills feels seen and valued.”“My Indian-American background gives me a unique perspective to bridge cultural gaps and make The Hills a place where diverse voices are celebrated. As mayor, I will preserve our community’s cherished character while embracing progress in safety, technology, and community engagement,” he asserted.Commitment to safety and communityHaving originally moved from India and lived in fast-paced cities, 35-year-old Naralasetty relocated to The Hills seeking a safer, more connected community for his family. \"Our move wasn’t part of the Covid wave of relocations; it was driven by the terrifying experience of a shootout right outside our home while our two children were inside. That day, we realized that we needed to make a change to ensure the safety and well-being of our family,\" he said.Since settling in The Hills, Naralasetty has become a local advocate, dedicated to enhancing the community’s sense of security and togetherness. His experiences have strengthened his resolve to uphold safety for all residents, a central theme in his mayoral campaign. “We chose The Hills because we wanted a place where our children could grow up free from fear, and I promise to uphold the safety that drew us here every day,” he said.From tech innovator to mayoral candidateAs the founder of Socialblood, Naralasetty demonstrated how technology could serve humanitarian causes. Now, he’s applying that same dedication to his mayoral campaign, aiming to support sustainable growth, safety, and community well-being in The Hills. His vision resonates with residents who seek a leader that values both innovation and the close-knit community spirit The Hills is known for.Karthik Naralasetty’s journey from tech entrepreneur to community advocate to mayoral candidate is driven by a purpose: to create a thriving, safe, and connected community. His campaign is grounded in the values of progress, family, and unity, which he hopes to champion for Texas residents as their future mayor.",
