The supply chain volatility data should serve as a warning about what would come next if the temporary pause in tariffs by the U.S. and China aren't extended permanently after the 90-day pause and the trade war re-escalates.The data showed a \"hockey stick\"-like upturn in April, according to Piatek, with North American companies aggressively stockpiling inventory at what he described as a \"concerning rate.\" At the same time, \"the first signs of manufacturers anticipating slower demand and supply shortages have emerged,\" he said.Purchasing activity by manufacturers in Asia was at its weakest since December 2023.One bright spot to offset pull back in manufacturing is Europe, where an industrial recession is coming to an end. The U.K., the first nation to sign a preliminary trade deal with the U.S., recorded significant manufacturing weakness, with supplier activity down to a rate near a record low based on the past two decades of data. But supply chain capacity in Germany and France, which was underutilized over the past year, is reflecting growth. Piatek cautioned that this could reverse if global trade conditions worsen.The GEP data also shows an increase in spare capacity across Asian supply chains in April, led by China, Taiwan and South Korea.Stephen Edwards, CEO of the Port of Virginia, told CNBC in an interview published this week that if the supply chain future is less China and more Southeast Asia, South Asia and Europe, the U.S. port is positioned for that growth.\"Our fastest growth over the last four years has been the Indian subcontinent, then Vietnam, then Europe,\" said Edwards.Trade from China has been flat for the last four years at Port of Virginia.\"It is our second-largest trading bloc after the European Union. So it's still a big block,\" he said. \"But if that is going to migrate over time, whatever the new trade environment is, there's an opportunity. We have not yet seen the trade agreements, but we believe that it's going to be less China and more from Southeast Asia and Europe. I think we're in a pretty good spot,\" Edwards said.",
