  "text": "Elon Musk on Thursday announced that he is stepping down from his role as a top adviser to US President Donald Trump, concluding his tenure as a special government employee tasked with leading a high-profile push to streamline federal bureaucracy.'My scheduled time comes to an end'Taking to X, he wrote, “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.”A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed Musk's exit. Musk's departure follows closely on the heels of his public criticism of Trump’s signature legislative proposal, a sweeping tax and immigration bill the president has dubbed his “big beautiful bill.”'It can be big or beautiful, but not both'Musk, speaking Tuesday night to CBS, described the legislation as a “massive spending bill.\" “I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,” Musk said. “But I don’t know if it could be both.”His critique appeared to strike a chord with fiscal conservatives. On Wednesday, Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) voiced his agreement, saying at a Milwaukee Press Club event, “I sympathise with Elon being discouraged.” Johnson added that he was “pretty confident” there’s enough GOP opposition to slow down the measure until the administration “gets serious” about reducing spending.'It’s got a way to go'In response to the criticism, Trump defended the legislation during remarks in the Oval Office, calling it a product of complex negotiations. “I’m not happy about certain aspects of it, but I’m thrilled by other aspects of it,” he said. “We’re going to see what happens. It’s got a way to go.”The bill, recently passed by the Republican-controlled House, now heads to the Senate, where debate is intensifying. House Speaker Mike Johnson has urged senators to avoid making significant changes, warning that the legislation represents a “very delicate balance” that could unravel if amended too heavily. The House will need to vote again once the Senate finalises its version.Musk’s departure adds another twist to the already contentious legislative push and signals growing tension within the Republican ranks over the future of fiscal policy.",
