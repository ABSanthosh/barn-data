  "text": "Anthony Albanese became the first Australian prime minister to clinch a second consecutive term in 21 years on Saturday in a dramatic comeback against once-resurgent conservatives that was powered by voters' concerns about the influence of US President Donald Trump.Peter Dutton, chief of the conservative Liberal party, conceded defeat and the loss of his own seat - echoing the fate of Canada's conservatives and their chief, Pierre Poilievre, whose election losses days earlier were also attributed to a Trump backlash.Albanese's centre-left Labor Party had branded Dutton 'DOGE-y Dutton' and accused the Liberals of mimicking Trump and his dept of govt efficiency.Supporters at Labor's election party in Sydney cheered and hugged each other as Albanese claimed victory and said his party would form a majority govt. \"Australians have chosen to face global challenges the Australian way, looking after each other while building for the future... We do not need to beg or borrow or copy from anywhere else. We do not seek our inspiration from overseas. We find it right here in our values and in our people,\" said Albanese.Dutton said he had phoned Albanese to congratulate him.",
