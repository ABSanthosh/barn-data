It was not easy but we've got them all signed on to five percent,\" Rutte added in text.When asked later whether it was embarrassing that his private message had been made public, Rutte told the BBC there was \"absolutely no problem, there was nothing in it that had to stay secret.\"Western leaders have had to manage their ties with Trump, whose approach to diplomacy is often seen as unpredictable.
