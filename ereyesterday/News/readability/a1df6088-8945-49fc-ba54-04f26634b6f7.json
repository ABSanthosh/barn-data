  "text": "Here is the latest on the hostage and prisoner releases.Hamas on Saturday released four female Israeli soldiers held hostage in Gaza, in a carefully choreographed show of force that highlighted how powerful the group remains inside the enclave. Hours later, Israel released 200 Palestinian prisoners to complete the exchange, part of the initial six-week cease-fire deal in the Gaza war.The Israeli government said in a statement that the women had been brought back to Israel, where they were reunited with their families after more than 15 months in captivity. In the West Bank city of Ramallah, crowds of Palestinians held aloft the returning prisoners, many of whom had been jailed for deadly militant attacks against Israelis.The swap is seen as a crucial test of how the 42-day truce between Israel and Hamas — the first stage of a multiphase agreement — will develop in the coming weeks. Mediators hope the deal leads to a permanent end to the devastating war, which has killed tens of thousands in Gaza and destroyed large parts of the enclave.Israel’s government identified the released women as Karina Ariev, 20; Daniella Gilboa, 20; Naama Levy, 20; and Liri Albag, 19. All four were abducted from the military base near Gaza where they had been serving during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which started the war.On Saturday, in scenes streamed live on Al Jazeera and watched breathlessly in Israel, armed and masked Hamas fighters marched the four soldiers past a cheering crowd in downtown Gaza City. They paraded them — in military-style clothes — onto a makeshift stage that displayed a banner reading “Zionism will not prevail” in Hebrew.After a brief ceremony, Hamas gunmen handed the women over to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which transported them to Israeli forces. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, called Hamas’s display with the four hostages “a cynical show.”In central Tel Aviv, crowds of family, friends and supporters, who had gathered to watch the handover live, were cheering, chanting the hostages’ names and crying with joy. “After 477 tumultuous days of pain, worry, and endless anxiety — we finally got to embrace our beloved Karina,” Ms. Ariev’s family said in a statement.Here is what else to know:Returning north: Under the terms of the cease-fire deal, Israeli forces are expected to partly withdraw from a major zone in central Gaza, enabling hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza. But that was uncertain on Saturday after the Israeli prime minister’s office said it would not allow Gazans to head north until the release of Arbel Yehud, one of the last civilian women in captivity, “is arranged,” as it says is stipulated by the deal.Prisoner releases: Many of the 200 Palestinian prisoners whom Israel released on Saturday were serving life sentences for involvement in attacks against Israelis. Around 70 are being exiled abroad as part of the agreement and will not be allowed to return to their homes in the West Bank and Jerusalem, according to a list provided by the Palestinian authorities.Four soldiers: The hostages had been recent recruits, working as “spotters” for Israel’s army, reporting on suspicious activity across the border. Here is more detail about them.Cease-fire deal: Hamas agreed in the deal to release 33 of the nearly 100 hostages who remained in Gaza over the first six weeks of the deal. So far, it has released seven, including the four on Saturday. Israel agreed to free over 1,500 Palestinian prisoners in exchange.Rawan Sheikh Ahmad contributed reporting.The sweeping halt to U.S. foreign aid does not apply to arms to Israel and Egypt, or emergency food assistance.ImageIsraeli soldiers carry combat equipment near the Israel-Gaza border.Credit...Tsafrir Abayov/Associated PressA sudden and sweeping halt to U.S. foreign aid by the Trump administration does not apply to weapons support to Israel and Egypt and emergency food assistance, according to a memo issued by the department to bureaus and U.S. missions overseas on Friday.The same day, the White House told the Pentagon it could proceed with a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel that President Biden abruptly halted last summer to try to dissuade the Israeli military from destroying much of the city of Rafah. Israeli forces went ahead with bombing the city.The shipment has 1,800 MK-84 bombs, said a White House official who agreed to discuss sensitive weapons aid on the condition of anonymity. Such bombs are judged by U.S. military officers to be generally too lethal and destructive for urban combat. Until the halt, the Biden administration had shipped the bombs to Israel as its military fought Hamas in Gaza.The memo on foreign aid was sent by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and lays out how the State Department, the linked United States Agency for International Development, or U.S.A.I.D., and other agencies are expected to execute an executive order halting foreign aid during a 90-day reassessment period. President Trump signed the executive order on Monday, soon after his inauguration.The memo requires any employee working on foreign aid to refrain from designating new funding and taking applications, and to issue “stop-work” orders to groups that have received grants. The memo has circulated online and has ignited panic among groups around the world that rely on foreign aid from the United States for their programs — which range from disease prevention to curbing infant mortality to alleviating the impact of climate change.ImageAid trucks on Saturday after crossing into Gaza.Credit...Hatem Khaled/ReutersSome groups say they will likely stop work immediately and begin laying off employees or suspending salaries.The State Department also oversees military aid to allies and partner nations. A line in the memo specifically exempts Israel and Egypt and any salaries paid to people who manage that aid. Both nations receive foreign military financing, which is direct money from the U.S. government for them to purchase weapons and other military equipment. They then use that money to buy arms and equipment from U.S. weapons makers, as well as to pay for military training.The halt to foreign aid applies to military assistance to Ukraine, Taiwan, Lebanon and other partner nations, including members of NATO. Much of the recent urgent aid for Ukraine in its defensive war against Russia has been sent out already. Officials in the Biden administration anticipated that Mr. Trump would try to halt arms aid to Ukraine since he had expressed skepticism about it. Mr. Rubio was one of 15 Republican senators who voted last April against legislation centered on weapons aid to Ukraine.The State Department did not have an immediate response when asked to comment for this story.Military support of Israel has become a divisive issue in the United States. Israel’s devastating strikes against Palestinians in Gaza, mostly using American bombs, since Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023 have galvanized widespread criticism of the decadeslong bipartisan policy of sending military aid to Israel. Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. approved $26 billion in military aid to Israel after the war began, and Mr. Trump has said he intends to continue supporting Israel.Some lawmakers, particularly Democrats, also criticize the long-running U.S. policy of giving substantial arms aid to Egypt. Last year, Congress approved $1.3 billion of military aid to Egypt, but said $320 million would be conditioned on a review by the State Department of whether Egypt had improved practices around human rights. Last September, the secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, approved that entire amount, despite persistent criticism of Egypt’s human rights record from some Democratic lawmakers and watchdog groups.The State Department memo also orders officials to set up a central repository or database of all foreign aid given out by the U.S. government, and it says all aid must be reviewed and approved by Mr. Rubio or people whom he designates with approval authority. This is to ensure that aid is “in keeping with one voice of American foreign policy.” People who have seen the memo confirmed its authenticity to The New York Times.The memo says the director of the office of policy planning in the department will develop guidelines for review of all foreign aid within 30 days. The director is Michael Anton, who worked on the National Security Council in the first Trump administration. Mr. Anton is known for writings that include a 2016 essay, “The Flight 93 Election,” that said conservatives must take radical action to remake America in their vision rather than stick with the status quo.Thousands of Israelis have gathered in Tel Aviv in support of hostages held in Gaza, raising images of the Israeli captives still in the territory and calling on the government to ensure everyone returns to Israel. Speakers expressed joy about the release of the four hostages on Saturday, but also shared concerns that Israel could choose to return to war before all the hostages are brought home.VideoCreditCredit...Amit Elkayam for The New York TimesA dispute over a hostage and a corridor has left displaced Palestinians anxiously waiting.ImagePalestinians waiting in central Gaza on Saturday to return to northern Gaza.Credit...Abdel Kareem Hana/Associated PressDisplaced Palestinians in southern and central Gaza were left wondering on Saturday when Israel would permit them to return to their homes in the northern part of the territory, as Israel and Hamas sparred over the implementation of the cease-fire deal.The Israeli prime minister’s office said Israel would prevent movement to the north of Gaza until plans were set for the release of Arbel Yehud, one of the last civilian women in captivity in Gaza.Israeli officials said the agreement had required Ms. Yehud to be released on Saturday. They said they believed that she wasn’t being held by Hamas, suggesting the holdup wasn’t solely Hamas’s responsibility.Hamas accused Israel of hesitating to implement the cease-fire agreement. The dispute was one of the most significant between the parties since the cease-fire took effect a week ago.The holdup left many Palestinians in a state of anxious waiting, as they were already packing their belongings, including kitchen supplies, clothing and mattress pads.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been looking forward to returning to their homes in northern Gaza — many of which were destroyed in Israel’s bombing campaign — after long months enduring miserable conditions in makeshift shelters, schools and friends’ and relatives’ homes.As of Saturday evening, neither Hamas nor the Israeli prime minister’s office had publicly announced plans for the release of Ms. Yehud.It was unclear what exactly would need to take place for Israel to consider Ms. Yehud’s release arranged, but Hamas has confirmed which hostages will be freed to Israel in the past by sending lists to Israel through mediators.The cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas says the Israeli military should withdraw eastward on the seventh day of the agreement and that displaced Palestinians could then begin to return to their homes. Even though Saturday was the seventh day of the agreement, the Hamas-run government media office said earlier this week that people would be allowed to return on Sunday.Avichai Adraee, the Arabic spokesman of the Israeli military, posted on social media on Saturday that it was still forbidden to approach the corridor linking central Gaza to the north, without clarifying when that would change.Palestinians in Gaza expressed nervousness as they waited for a resolution.“Everyone is worried and cautious,” said Ibrahim Abdulwahed, 40, a displaced man in the central city of Deir al-Balah. He said he was hopeful Israel and Hamas would resolve the issue.Others said their excitement about returning home was mixed with fears about the devastation they would encounter after 15 months of Israeli bombardment.“My husband and I have been waiting for this day with so much anticipation, but I can’t help feeling frightened about the great destruction I’ll see on the way back,” said Nour Qasim, 22, a displaced person in Nuseirat, in central Gaza.Even as Israel cast doubt on when Gazans would be able to return north, some people displaced to other parts of the enclave were gearing up on Saturday to go back to their homes there. Their excitement was mixed with worry about the devastation they would encounter after 15 months of Israeli bombardment. \"I can’t help feeling frightened about the great destruction I’ll see on the way back,” said Nour Qasim, 22, originally a resident of Gaza City. ImageCredit...Abdel Kareem Hana/Associated PressIt’s a day of mixed emotions for families of the freed Palestinian prisoners.ImagePreparing for the release of the Palestinian prisoners in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, on Saturday.Credit...Afif Amireh for The New York TimesFor the families of the 200 Palestinian prisoners released on Saturday in exchange for the four freed hostages, it has been a day of mixed emotions.Roughly 70 of the prisoners will be sent to exile in places like Egypt as part of the cease-fire deal, because Israel refused to allow them to return to their family homes in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.Nasr Abu Hmeid, 51, is set to be among them. One of three brothers listed for exile, he was jailed in 2002 for his role in terrorist attacks on Israelis. The Israeli authorities consider his convictions too grave to let him return home.On Saturday, Mr. Abu Hmeid’s wife, Alaa Naji, was preparing to travel to Egypt to be reunited with her husband.“It’s a bittersweet moment,” she said in an interview. “We dedicated our lives to fighting for freedom in our homeland, but now we are forced to leave it.”Mr. Abu Hmeid comes from a well-known family of Palestinian militants who are considered heroes by Palestinians and terrorists by Israelis. One of his brothers died from cancer while in Israeli custody, and Israel is still holding the body.Mr. Abu Hmeid’s son, Raed, is also in an Israeli jail and is not listed for release.“Now, our whole family — my mother-in-law, sisters-in-law and I — are preparing to leave for Cairo tomorrow,” Ms. Naji said. She said it would be her husband’s first chance to meet their youngest son, 5-year-old Yaman, who was conceived through in vitro fertilization using sperm smuggled from Mr. Abu Hmeid during his incarceration.Such sperm smuggling, which became popular a decade ago, has led the Israeli prison authorities to try to prevent prisoners from passing their sperm to visitors.“Yaman is so happy to finally meet his baba outside prison, but he’s also heartbroken about leaving,” Ms. Naji said. “He doesn’t want to leave his toys, friends and school behind.”Busloads of freed Palestinian prisoners have reached cheering crowds in Ramallah, in scenes streamed live by Al Jazeera. Some — still wearing gray uniforms apparently issued by the Israeli prison authority — are being held aloft on the shoulders of members of the chanting crowd.This is the moment released prisoners were welcomed by crowds in Ramallah.VideoCreditCredit...Afif Amireh for The New York TimesIsrael releases 200 Palestinian prisoners, many of whom were serving life sentences.ImagePalestinian prisoners arriving in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, on Saturday after they were released from an Israeli jail.Credit...Afif Amireh for The New York TimesIsrael released 200 Palestinian prisoners on Saturday in exchange for four soldiers who were being held hostage by Hamas. Dozens of the prisoners had been serving life sentences in Israeli jails for attacks against Israelis.The Israeli prison service said in a statement that the prisoners had been released from Ofer Prison near the city of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank and from another facility near Beersheba in southern Israel.Israelis view them as terrorists, while many Palestinians say that they conducted legitimate resistance to Israeli rule or view them as victims of Israel’s decades-long occupation.Hundreds of Palestinians gathered at a Ramallah municipal building to welcome the prisoners home, pushing to get hold of their loved ones as they stepped out of the Red Cross buses that were transporting them.Some freed prisoners, still wearing gray uniforms apparently issued by the Israeli prison authority, were held on the shoulders of the chanting crowd.“We leave our jail but the price is high for our freedom,” Mohammad Arda, one of the freed prisoners, told reporters, as family and friends huddled around him. “I’m thinking about the families of the inmates we lost during the past year and a half.”On Sunday, Israel released 90 Palestinian prisoners, mostly women and minors, in exchange for three female hostages. This time, the Israeli authorities are freeing many people who were convicted of much heavier offenses, including the murder of Israeli civilians in militant attacks.According to the Israeli government, Mr. Arda — an activist in Palestinian Islamic Jihad — had been sentenced to life for attempted murder and planting an explosive device, among other offenses. He was one of six prisoners who briefly escaped from an Israeli prison in 2021, stunning Israelis and Palestinians, before he was caught.More than 1,500 Palestinians jailed by Israel are due to be released as part of the first stage of the cease-fire and hostage-release agreement. Hamas has pledged to release 33 hostages; 97 were held in Gaza when the deal went into effect last Sunday, according to the Israeli authorities.About 120 of the Palestinian prisoners released on Saturday were serving life sentences for involvement in attacks against Israelis, according to lists provided by the Hamas-linked prisoners’ office. Under the terms of the agreement, about 70 will be expelled from Israeli-held territory to Hamas-controlled areas of the Gaza Strip or abroad to countries like Egypt.Those being released on Saturday included Mohammad Odeh, Wael Qassim and Wissam Abbasi, who were arrested in 2002 for a string of deadly bombings targeting Israelis in crowded civilian areas. All three were serving life sentences for their involvement in the attacks.One of the group’s most infamous attacks — which took place at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem — killed nine people, including five Americans.The three men are all slated to be exiled abroad and will never be allowed to return to their homes in Jerusalem, according to the terms of the agreement.A helicopter carrying hostages landed outside Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva, a city in central Israel, to the excited cheers of hundreds who gathered to welcome their arrival with Israeli flags.Yossi Aharon, 40, who waited in a parking lot bordering the helipad with his three children this afternoon, said the release “gives hope that more hostages will return.”ImageCredit...Amit Elkayam for The New York TimesThis is the moment when the helicopter landed outside of the hospital.VideoIn images streamed on Arabic-language television, Red Cross buses can be seen heading through downtown Ramallah amid crowds seeking a glimpse.Israel has released 200 Palestinian prisoners as part of the cease-fire and hostage release deal with Hamas, the Israeli prison service said in a statement.

Israel said it had released 200 Palestinian prisoners as part of the cease-fire and hostage release deal with Hamas.CreditCredit...Omar Al-Qattaa/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesFor the second time in a week, Hamas used the handing over of hostages to the Red Cross to project an image that it is still a powerful force in charge of the Gaza Strip, despite 15 months of a war that has killed thousands of its fighters and civilians, and reduced cities to rubble.The handover of four hostages on Saturday was an even more performative stunt than the one last Sunday, when three other female hostages were released.On Saturday, Hamas set up a stage in Palestine Square in the center of Gaza City — an area devastated by Israel’s bombing campaign and ground incursion. The stage held a banner bearing a message in Hebrew: “Zionism will not win.” Hundreds of masked, uniformed fighters and civilians gathered nearby.On the stage, Hamas held a signing ceremony between one of its members and a representative of the Red Cross, which later received the four hostages.The hostages, all soldiers who were lookouts at a base on the Gaza border and abducted from there on Oct. 7, 2023, during the Hamas-led attack on Israel, arrived to the square in a convoy of midsize sport utility vehicles. They were led onto the stage, clothed in military-style fatigues, which seemed intended to make a point that these hostages were soldiers, not civilians.Militants holding expensive cameras followed the hostages, likely to make a video that will be published on social media.Onstage, the hostages smiled and waved at the cheering and whistling onlookers as gun-toting Hamas militants stood beside them.The Red Cross said it would not comment on ongoing operations.Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman of the Israeli military, said Hamas proved its “cruelty” during Saturday’s handover, which he described as a “cynical ceremony.”Israeli officials have said Hamas has forced hostages to smile and wave as part of a propaganda effort aimed at conveying the message that the group was treating its captives well. Former hostages, however, have reported being abused, including one who spoke publicly about being sexually assaulted and tortured.ImageA member of the Red Cross signing a document before Hamas fighters handed over the four hostages in Gaza City on Saturday.Credit...Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersIn a recent interview with an Israeli TV station, Chen Goldstein-Almog, an Israeli hostage released in November 2023, said that when she and her daughter, Agam, were let go, they were transferred to a Red Cross vehicle that was surrounded by a large crowd of people.“I remember that Agam told me: ‘Mom, today we’re going to die,’” she said, recalling that moment. “It was terrifying until the end.”In an interview after last Sunday’s release of hostages, Yves Daccord, the former director general of the Red Cross, said handoffs of hostages should occur in a quiet place, away from the public.“In general, the ideal is without a crowd,” Mr. Daccord said. Releasing hostages at a large public gathering, he added, was laden with risks and unpredictability.Israeli medical professionals advocating for hostages in Gaza warned that chaotic handoffs could trigger traumatic memories of the hostages’ first moments in Gaza, in which militants drove some of them through rowdy crowds.“The release is reliving, to some extent, the kidnapping,” said Dr. Hagai Levine, the head of the medical team with the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an Israeli group.Since the cease-fire deal between Hamas and Israel came into effect last Sunday, Hamas has worked hard to show that it remains the dominant Palestinian party in Gaza, with militants parading through city centers and police officers deploying at intersections.It is not clear how many fighters, police officers, bureaucrats and political leaders survived the war, but by showcasing the handovers in such a public way, Hamas made clear that it is still standing in parts of Gaza that were subjected to some of the most destructive bombing attacks of the war.Patrick Kingsley contributed reporting.Now that the four Israelis have been freed, roughly 200 Palestinian prisoners are set to be released later today from Israeli jails — many of them into exile. Alaa Naji, the wife of one of the Palestinians listed for release, says it is “a bittersweet moment.” Her husband, Nasr — jailed two decades ago for his role in terrorist attacks on Israelis — is set to be sent to Egypt. “We dedicated our lives to fighting for freedom in our homeland, but now we are forced to leave it,” said Ms. Naji, who will join her husband in Egypt.At the entrance to the village where 19-year-old Liri Albag is from, dozens of people gathered to celebrate her return, waving Israeli flags and chanting her name.Cheers and cries as their friend is released from Hamas captivity.ImageFriends of Liri Albag, one of the four Israeli soldiers newly freed, reacting at the live broadcast of her release as they watched from Matan, Israel, on Saturday.Credit...Amit Elkayam for The New York TimesWhen they spotted Liri Albag being marched by Hamas militants through a Gaza square on a live television broadcast, a group of her close friends burst into a mix of cheers, laughter and tears.Ms. Albag was one of four female soldiers held hostage since the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and released on Saturday as part of a cease-fire deal. Nine of her friends came together to follow along, watching television from one of their family homes in Matan, a village in central Israel.They looked on tensely as images of the four hostages, dressed in military-style clothing, left Gaza City surrounded by armed and masked Hamas fighters and cheering civilians.“She’s walking!” one friend exclaimed upon seeing the images of Ms. Albag. “What a relief,” another added, as Ms. Albag, surrounded by militants, smiled brightly for the cameras and gave a thumbs-up.“I didn’t expect her to pose with such strength,” said Tal Dimant, 19. “My body is shaking,” she added.The hostages freed on Saturday were soldiers posted to a base on the Gaza border and were lookouts responsible for monitoring the border. Their release was the second step of a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas. (Three hostages were released on Sunday, the first day of the cease-fire, and Israel released 90 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons as part of that initial exchange.)This month, Hamas released an edited video of Ms. Albag, which helped reassure her relatives that she was alive but raised concerns about her condition.Ms. Dimant, who described herself as a childhood friend of Ms. Albag, wore a white T-shirt featuring a photograph of the two from their high school prom.Ms. Dimant said her joy on Saturday was tempered by an agonizing wait for another friend, Agam Berger, who was abducted with Ms. Albag and remains in captivity.“We will not be truly happy until all the hostages are released,” Ms. Dimant said.Israel had been expected to withdraw some of its forces to allow hundreds of thousands of displaced Gazans to head north after Saturday’s exchange. But the Israeli prime minister’s office just said that it would not allow Gazans to head north “until the release of the civilian Arbel Yehud has been arranged.”Israel has said the deal stipulates the release of all living civilian women first, including Arbel Yehud. Hamas has not publicly provided a reason that Yehud, was not released today.Rawan Sheikh AhmadReporting from Haifa, IsraelRuhama Albag, the aunt of one of the newly released hostages, Liri Albag, has been speaking on live television about her relief and joy. “Far from what I expected, she looks vibrant,” Ms. Albag said. “She is cheerful, waving her hand, her spirit unbroken.”Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, accused Hamas of violating the deal by not returning female civilians first. Israeli officials had earlier expected Arbel Yehud, an Israeli woman, to be one of the four released today. Hagari added that Israel was “extremely concerned about the fate” of another Israeli woman and her two young children in Hamas captivity.ImageCredit...Hostages families forum, via Associated PressHagari also condemned Hamas’s show of force in Gaza City.I’m at a party that friends of Liri Albag, one of the hostages that was just released, set up to watch the release.

They waved and smiled at a cheering crowd, grinning at one another as Hamas fighters in balaclavas surrounded them.The hostage release is part of a 42-day cease-fire deal that went into effect on Sunday, pausing the fighting between Israel and Hamas. Hamas agreed to incrementally release 33 of the nearly 100 remaining hostages in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinians jailed by Israel and a partial Israeli withdrawal.The hostages had been recent recruits, working as “spotters” for Israel’s army, reporting on suspicious activity across the border. During the Hamas-led attack, militants stormed the Nahal Oz military base in Israel, killing more than 50 soldiers and abducting the women, who were teenagers at the time, and three other female soldiers.In May, the Israel military released a three-minute edited collection of videos, verified by The New York Times, showing Palestinian fighters, some wearing Hamas headbands, binding the hands of five women, including the four who were released on Saturday. The footage was recorded by body cameras worn by the Hamas militants who abducted them, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents relatives of many of the captives.Here is what else we know about the four released hostages.Liri AlbagImageLiri Albag, a soldier who was seized from her army base in southern Israel during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack, in a photograph released by Bring Them Home Now.Credit...via ReutersMs. Albag, who has dreamed of becoming an architect and interior designer, joined the Israeli military soon after graduating from high school, according to a statement by the Hostage Families Forum.Her family expressed relief and joy at seeing her being released. “Far from what I expected, she looks vibrant,” Ruhama Albag, her aunt, said on live television. “She is cheerful, waving her hand, her spirit unbroken.”In January, Hamas’s military wing released an edited video of Ms. Albag, now 19, speaking for three and a half minutes, in which she said she had been held for more than 450 days.In a statement at the time, Ms. Albag’s family said that “her severe psychological distress” was evident in the video and asked Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and other leaders to “make decisions as if your own children were there.”“She is just dozens of kilometers away from us, yet for 456 days we have been unable to bring her home,” the family said.Karina ArievImageKarina Ariev, a soldier who turned 20 in captivity, in a photograph released by Bring Them Home Now.Credit...via ReutersMs. Ariev, 20, is the daughter of immigrants from Ukraine, and her family described her as “the connecting force” among friends and family, the families forum said.She called her parents during the attack, describing militants firing guns and rockets, and told them she loved them, according to the Israeli news media. Her family later that day found a Hamas video posted on social media that showed Ms. Ariev and two other women in a jeep, her face bleeding, they said.In August, Ms. Ariev’s older sister, Sasha Ariev, said at an event in Jerusalem spoke of moving home after the Oct. 7 attack to help her struggling parents who were feeling increasingly helpless.Ms. Ariev’s sister said the hostage crisis was consuming her. “How can I sleep when we haven’t succeeded in bringing Karina and all the other hostages home?” she said. “How can I sleep when I’m in my bed and she’s a hostage?”Daniella GilboaImageA photo released by Hostages Family Forum showing Daniella Gilboa.Credit...via Associated PressDaniella Gilboa, 20, is from Petah Tikva, in central Israel. At the time of her abduction, Ms. Gilboa had been studying piano and hoped to perform professionally one day, the forum said.In July, Ms. Gilboa’s family released a video made by Hamas that they had received months earlier, which showed her and Ms. Ariev in captivity.In an interview with Maariv, an Israeli newspaper, the father of Ms. Gilboa’s boyfriend said the family was feeling mixed emotions over the video. “In her family, there is a feeling of relief alongside a feeling of disappointment,” he was quoted as saying.Naama LevyImageNaama Levy, a soldier who was seized from her army base in southern Israel, in a photograph released by Bring Them Home Now.Credit...via ReutersNaama Levy, who is also now 20, is a triathlete who grew up in Raanana, a leafy town north of Tel Aviv, the forum said.She texted her mother from a safe room on the day of the attack, according to a website focused on campaigning for her release. “I’ve never heard anything like this,” she wrote.A Hamas video of her being taken to Gaza circulated on social media shortly after the attack.In an interview for a documentary about sexual violence during the attack, Ayelet Levy Sachar, Naama’s mother, spoke of her daughter’s kidnapping. She was seen in a Hamas video in pajama bottoms, drenched in blood.“They’re grabbing her by the hair, and she’s all, like, messed up,” she said, adding: “We would like to think that this couldn’t be possible, that nobody would harm a young girl. But then you just see it there.”Hamas’s message? They’re organized, and they’re still in charge. Even the decision to clothe the hostages in military-style fatigues seemed designed to make a point: These were soldiers, not civilians.Israel just announced that the hostages Naama Levy, 20; Liri Albag, 19; Karina Ariev, 20; and Daniella Gilboa, 20, have officially been released to Israeli custody.The Hostage Families’ Forum, a group that represents most of the relatives of Israelis held hostage by Hamas in Gaza, hailed the release of the four female hostages and called on all sides to uphold the cease-fire deal. “Their return today represents a moment of light in the darkness,” the group said in a statement, “while serving as a painful reminder of the urgency to bring back the 90 hostages still in Gaza.” The Israeli military just said that the four hostages had been handed over to Israeli soldiers inside the Gaza Strip. They are being brought back to Israeli territory, where they will undergo preliminary medical tests after over 15 months in captivity in Gaza.Since the start of the war, we’ve seen at least eight hostage handovers inside Gaza. Today’s was by far the most performative. It involved a stage, an exchange of documents between Hamas and the Red Cross, and hundreds of masked, uniformed militants.

Biden Jr. approved $26 billion in military aid to Israel after the war began, and Mr. Trump has said he intends to continue supporting Israel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome lawmakers, particularly Democrats, also criticize the long-running U.S. policy of giving substantial arms aid to Egypt. Last year, Congress approved $1.3 billion of military aid to Egypt, but said $320 million would be conditioned on a review by the State Department of whether Egypt had improved practices around human rights. Last September, the secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, approved that entire amount, despite persistent criticism of Egypt’s human rights record from some Democratic lawmakers and watchdog groups.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe State Department memo also orders officials to set up a central repository or database of all foreign aid given out by the U.S. government, and it says all aid must be reviewed and approved by Mr. Rubio or people whom he designates with approval authority.
