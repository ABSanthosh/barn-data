(WABC)The commissioner said officers went to the home when one of the victims, an 11-year-old girl, called 911 after running and hiding in a bedroom as the attack was going on.\"The 11-year-old caller stated that she and her siblings had been stabbed by their uncle,\" Tisch said.Tisch said the girl didn't know her address and police used technology to trace the phone the child used to make the call to find the location of the assault in progress.\"Officers and EMS arrived at the door within minutes of receiving the 911 call. Their fast, decisive action pinpointing the location and taking down the door absolutely saved the lives of these young girls,\" Tisch said.The incident unfolded around 10:15 a.m., Tisch said. She said that once the attack began, a young boy who is related to the family ran to a neighbor's apartment to get help and let police into the building when they arrived.Tisch said officers were standing in a vestibule of the building when they heard screams coming from an apartment to their left. Officers then kicked open the door to the apartment, she said.\"Once they entered, they encountered a man standing near the entrance holding a large meat cleaver covered in blood and they could see blood on the floor and the walls of the home,\" Tisch said.PHOTO: A New York City police detective holds up photos of two bloody knives recovered from a Brooklyn home where police fatally shot a man who allegedly stabbed four young relatives, April 6, 2025.
