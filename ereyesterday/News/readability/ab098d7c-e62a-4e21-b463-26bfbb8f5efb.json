  "text": "As NATO’s yearly summit concluded in The Hague on Wednesday, alliance leaders agreed to increase defense spending to 5 percent of national income across member countries by 2035. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte heralded the hike as a “quantum leap” for collective defense, expected to strengthen alliance members’ ability to invest in new military hardware, cybersecurity and energy projects.Some world leaders had expressed doubts about the viability of this hefty goal, which President Donald Trump floated in early January. NATO set a 2 percent target in 2014, but more than a decade later, only 70 percent of member states are on track to meet that, defense expenditure data shows.Here’s where defense spending among NATO members stood as of last year:To meet the new target, countries could rely on creative accounting, including for infrastructure projects that also serve military purposes.Poland leads among NATO members, allocating more than 4 percent of its gross domestic product to defense, according to NATO figures. It nearly doubled its contributions after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 — a display of aggression that cued similar investments from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Finland.The United States spends some 3.5 percent of GDP on defense, and in absolute terms more than any other country by far.Britain has consistently dedicated about 2 percent of its GDP to defense. The prime minister’s office called its 5 percent pledge “historic” in a statement that promised to deepen Britain’s commitment to NATO and deliver security for the nation’s working class.Spain has trailed the pack for more than a decade. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has repeatedly insisted that a modest defense budget increase would enable the nation to uphold its commitments to ensure European security, and last weekend he said Spain would not meet the 5 percent target.Trump threatened retribution Wednesday, saying in a news conference, “We’re negotiating with Spain on a trade deal, and we’re going to make them pay twice as much — and I’m actually serious about that.”Some member states have modulated their defense spending over the past decade. Both Greece and Turkey have invested more than 3 percent of their GDP in defense at varying points, often responding to the pressures of cross-border migration or other regional tensions.Iceland, as the sole NATO member without a military, will not be held to the 5 percent goal. Leaders of Iceland’s ruling coalition released a joint opinion piece Wednesday in Visir, an Icelandic online newspaper, affirming their commitment to strengthening their nation’s defense and security infrastructure, while increasing defense-related spending to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2035.NATO members have agreed to a 2029 budget review to track their collective progress on spending commitments outlined in a joint declaration issued Wednesday.",
