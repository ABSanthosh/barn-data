The convoy then received permission to continue but was soon blocked once again by Israeli forces. They instructed aid workers to off-load the food, which did not reach Beit Hanoun, in Gaza’s far northeast, he said.Georgios Petropoulos, head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs mission in Gaza, provided a similar account: The convoy was looted at the checkpoint and then sent back. The Israel Defense Forces referred a request for comment to COGAT, the Israeli agency for the Palestinian territories. COGAT did not immediately respond.In response to a request for comment about the incident, a State Department spokesperson who spoke on the condition of anonymity per department policy, said that at the time of the briefing on Thursday, the United States “knew the convoy had been deployed, something we had been insisting on for some time, and we had been told it made it to its destination in Beit Hanoun. Later we were made aware that wasn’t the case and ultimately, the aid did reach just south of its intended destination, in Beit Lahia.”Miller said Israel has taken a “number of important steps over the past several weeks, including in just the past few days” to increase humanitarian assistance to Gaza. The remarks come ahead of the U.S.-imposed deadline next week for Israelis to improve aid deliveries to the enclave. If Israel does not improve the situation, the United States could withhold military aid, Biden administration officials warned in a letter last month.Cindy McCain, executive director of the World Food Program, said Friday that famine was “likely happening or imminent in north Gaza.” She said in a statement on X that “immediate steps” must be taken to “prevent an all-out catastrophe. NOW.”The conditions in northern Gaza have grown increasingly dire, Palestinians and humanitarians say. Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, said the only U.N. aid that has reached the area since Israel began an intense offensive there a month ago were supplies to hospitals delivered during medical evacuations.“We are in a starvation phase now,” said Ayed Abu Ramadan, head of the Gaza Chamber of Commerce. “Very soon we will be in famine phase and people might die.”Northern Gaza resident Saeed Kilani, 41, said the situation there was “devastating.” Food is nowhere to be found and the only water available is incredibly saline, unfit for “animals or plants, yet we have no choice but to drink it.”“During the initial invasion, we survived by eating grass, but now even that is gone,” he said.Miriam Berger and Loveday Morris contributed to this report.",
