And again, I just believe these Chinese tariffs are unsustainable.\"Bessent predicted last week that a \"de-escalation\" with China was coming in the \"very near future.\"On Monday morning, he pointed to that prospective de-escalation to help explain why he was not yet concerned that U.S. consumers could soon face empty store shelves.\"Not at present,\" Bessent said on Fox News, when asked if he was concerned about \"empty shelves.\"\"We have some great retailers. I assume they preordered. I think we'll see some elasticities and I think we'll see replacements, and then we will see how quickly the Chinese want to de-escalate,\" said Bessent.In a separate interview Monday morning on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" Bessent put the onus for that de-escalation on China, before saying he would not negotiate through the press.China has consistently demanded that Trump, who has held up tariffs as both a powerful negotiating tool and a way to rake in government revenue, scrap his sweeping import taxes.\"If the U.S. really wants to resolve the problem … it should cancel all the unilateral measures on China,\" a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said last week.That statement, translated from Mandarin by CNBC, was itself a response to Trump's claim on Thursday that U.S. and Chinese officials \"had a meeting this morning.\"\"We've been meeting with China,\" Trump told reporters, while declining to specify who was meeting whom.A day earlier, Trump said U.S. officials were \"actively\" talking with China.",
