Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were set to meet with other European leaders on Sunday, including Zelensky.Before he became Pope Leo, Father Robert Prevost reposted multiple posts that took aim at Vance’s complicity in the Trump administration’s draconian immigration policies. He reposted a National Catholic Reporter op-ed with the title “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others,” and he shared other op-eds that highlighted the plight of migrants deported to El Salvador.Vance side-stepped the criticism in an interview with Hugh Hewitt earlier this month. “I try not to play the politicization of the Pope game,” he said.Pope Leo XIV met with President of Peru Dina Boluarte on Sunday, though not with Vice President JD Vance. / Vatican Pool / Vatican Media via Vatican Pool/GettyVance’s history with pontiffs while vice president has not been bright. Pope Francis criticized Vance’s defense of the immigration crackdown in a February letter to Catholic bishops, which Vance lodged on religious grounds.“The act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defenselessness,” he wrote.Vance said in February he wouldn’t litigate “about who’s right and who’s wrong,” and he later met with Francis on April 20 at the Vatican, where the Pope received the vice president for a brief private meeting and presented him with gifts. Francis died the next day.Still, Vance has tried to mend his ties with Catholic leadership. He visited Pope Francis’ tomb on Saturday, posting on X that he was “praying for the repose of his soul.”“He was beloved by many Catholics around the world,” he said.",
