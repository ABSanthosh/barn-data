  "text": "President Donald Trump said Monday that Iran and the United States have begun direct talks over Tehran’s nuclear program, contradicting Iranian leaders’ rejection of the idea just hours before he spoke.“We’re having direct talks with Iran, and they’ve started. It’ll go on Saturday. We have a very big meeting, and we’ll see what can happen,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Trump offered direct negotiations with Iran in a letter sent to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, its supreme leader, early last month, a diplomatic overture wrapped in a threat. Unless Tehran agreed to abandon its nuclear program and cease support for proxy militias in the Middle East, he said in a television interview last week, “there will be bombing.”In its response letter to Trump and in numerous public statements, Tehran has repeatedly said it is not interested in direct, face-to-face talks with the United States and would agree only to indirect negotiations through a third party.On Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi again rejected direct talks as “meaningless with a party that constantly threatens to resort to force in violation of the U.N. Charter and that expresses contradictory positions from its various officials,” according to Iranian media accounts. “However, we remain committed to diplomacy and are ready to try the path of indirect negotiations,” Araghchi added.On Monday morning, Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said that his government’s position had not changed and that its offer “to begin indirect talks was a generous, responsible and a politically wise offer.” He noted that such conversations had been mediated in the past by Oman.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, speaking to representatives of political parties and civil associations Monday, said the United States must “prove that they are looking for negotiations. … We believe in negotiation, but not in humiliation.”In a social media post late Monday following Trump’s remarks, Araghchi confirmed that “indirect high-level talks” would be held Saturday in Oman. “It is as much an opportunity as it is a test,” he said. “The ball is in America’s court.”A person familiar with the matter, speaking on the condition of anonymity about sensitive diplomacy, said Iranian officials were caught off guard by Trump’s declaration. For years, the restricted dialogue between Washington and Tehran has been conducted with intermediaries passing messages between the two sides, an indication of the deep fissures between the two countries.During his first presidential term, in 2018, Trump withdrew from an Obama-era agreement between world powers and Tehran to limit Iran’s uranium enrichment and submit the country to strict verification in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. Trump subsequently imposed “maximum pressure” sanctions, and Iran began enriching vast stockpiles of near-weapons-grade nuclear material.The Biden administration, in an effort to revive the 2015 agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, held two years of indirect talks with Iran in Vienna, mediated by European parties. But while it offered enticements including lifting some sanctions, the negotiations were unsuccessful. Several other indirect, and equally unsuccessful, sessions took place in Oman before President Joe Biden left office.Trump offered no concrete details on the talks he said were happening, except that they would be at a “high” level. Asked to provide guidance on any upcoming negotiations, National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt referred “to the president’s comments.”“Either you believe the Iranians or you believe President Trump,” said a senior White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the talks.Tehran insists that its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes, but a senior Khamenei aide last week said Iran would “move toward” a weapon if attacked.Despite the threats to Iran, Trump has also expressed his lack of appetite for starting a war there or participating in one with Israel, which has grown increasingly vocal about its desire to attack, ideally with U.S. assistance. Israel, with backing from some administration officials, has argued that Iranian support for proxy militias such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis will never end until its offensive capabilities are destroyed and that now — following Israeli attacks last year on its air defenses — is the right time.“I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious,” Trump said Monday, apparently referring to bombing Iran. “And the obvious is not something that I want to be involved in or frankly that Israel wants to be involved with, if they can avoid it. So we’re going to see if we can avoid it. But it’s getting to be very dangerous territory, and hopefully those talks will be successful.”Trump and Netanyahu, who canceled a joint news conference that was to follow their talks Monday, commented to reporters in an impromptu Oval Office session.“We’re both united in the goal that Iran does not ever get nuclear weapons, if it can be done diplomatically … in a full way, the way it was done in Libya,” Netanyahu said. Libya’s then-leader Moammar Gaddafi agreed in 2003 to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction, including a nascent nuclear weapons program.“I think that would be a good thing,” Netanyahu said. “But whatever happens, we have to make sure that Iran does not have a nuclear program.”Netanyahu said he and Trump had also discussed Gaza, where Israel has launched renewed air and ground attacks, stopped the entry of all humanitarian aid, and claimed new territory since the collapse of a brief ceasefire last month.Israel is committed to winning the release of about two dozen living Hamas-held hostages inside Gaza, as well as the remains of about an equal number who have been killed, “but also eliminating Hamas,” Netanyahu said, “and enabling the people of Gaza to be free to make a choice to do whatever they want. They should have that choice.”He said they had discussed the “bold vision” put forward by Trump to relocate Gaza’s 2.2 million people and rebuild the enclave into a beachfront resort, and had explored “the countries that might be available … to accepting Palestinians … if they choose to go.”John Hudson and Cat Zakrzewski contributed to this report.",
