  "text": "US President-elect Donald Trump announced Pam Bondi, Florida's former attorney general, as his choice for US attorney general on Thursday, following Matt Gaetz's withdrawal from consideration. Bondi, a steadfast Trump supporter, served as one of his defence lawyers during his first impeachment trial regarding allegations of power misuse concerning Ukraine and Biden investigations.Bondi demonstrated her loyalty by supporting Trump at his New York hush money trial, which concluded in May with 34 felony convictions. She has held a leadership position at the America First Policy Institute, an organisation established by former Trump administration personnel.\"For too long, the partisan department of justice has been weaponised against me and other Republicans - Not anymore,\" Trump said in a social media post. \"Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again.\"Donald Trump Jr indicated on Fox Business that alternative candidates were available for controversial nominations. Bondi's selection came shortly after Gaetz's withdrawal, which occurred amidst ongoing concerns about a federal sex trafficking investigation.The eight-day period saw Trump attempting to leverage his election victory to secure Senate Republican support for controversial choices like Gaetz. This development may increase attention on other contentious nominees, including Pete Hegseth for the Pentagon position, who contests sexual assault allegations.\"While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition,\" Gaetz said, following his meetings with senators. He later indicated on social media his intention to continue his political work in a different capacity.Trump expressed appreciation for Gaetz's efforts via social media, \"I greatly appreciate the recent efforts of Matt Gaetz in seeking approval to be Attorney General. He was doing very well but, at the same time, did not want to be a distraction for the Administration, for which he has much respect. Matt has a wonderful future, and I look forward to watching all of the great things he will do!\"Previously, Trump appointed Todd Blanche, Emil Bove and D John Sauer to senior departmental positions, while Matt Whitaker received the nomination for US ambassador to Nato.",
