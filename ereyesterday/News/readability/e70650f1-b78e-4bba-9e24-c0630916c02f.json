  "text": "(FOX40.COM) — A Northern California casino is making a multi-billion-dollar investment to create a one-of-a-kind entertainment district that could transform the region’s landscape.The 40-acre Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Sacramento at Fire Mountain recently acquired an additional 350 acres. The stretch of underdeveloped land between the casino and Toyota Amphitheatre has been untouched for decades, but is expected to be transformed into what officials call a top-tier destination. Soon to come is a festival entertainment district, rodeo space, sports and resort programming, retail, dining, walking paths, and possible stadium and fairground areas. Martin Lawrence adds Northern California to comedy tour “It will bring thousands of jobs and enhance the quality of life for existing residents by increasing local dining, entertainment, and retail options,” said District 4 Yuba County Supervisor Gary Bradford. “In addition, it will increase tax revenue and could attract millions of people to Yuba County to visit the destination.”Since the Hard Rock’s opening in 2019, it has reportedly contributed nearly $2.5 billion to the local economy. While the operation currently sits on tribal land, the expansion will not – which means regular sales and property tax revenue would benefit Yuba County.Officials said the new developments are expected to cost between $2 billion and $4 billion. Construction could take 5-10 years to complete, but may begin as soon as 2026. Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
