  "text": "A boat carrying aid for Gaza that was seized by Israeli forces docked at Israel’s Ashdod port late Monday, officials said. Israeli commandos had intercepted the vessel, arranged by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, off the coast of Egypt overnight, detaining passengers including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.“The passengers are undergoing medical examinations to ensure they are in good health,” Israel’s Foreign Ministry said shortly after the arrival in port of the British-flagged Madleen.It was the latest in a series of ships that have tried to break Israel’s years-long naval blockade of the Gaza Strip, where a devastating war has destroyed much of the territory and, experts warn, the population is at risk of famine. Most ships have been stopped by Israeli forces or been prevented from leaving their ports of origin.The Foreign Ministry said the 12 passengers, including a French member of the European Parliament, “are expected to return to their home countries.” Israeli officials portrayed the journey as a publicity stunt, mocking what the Foreign Ministry described as a “tiny amount of aid” for people in the war-battered territory.The Freedom Flotilla Coalition had said the amount of aid, including rice, baby formula and medical supplies, was symbolic. The trip by the Madleen, the coalition said, was aimed at defying Israel’s blockade in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.The boat’s seizure began about 2 a.m. local time Monday, according to the coalition. “Communications are jammed, and disturbing sounds are being played over the radio,” the group said in a post on Telegram.It said the vessel had been surrounded by quadcopters and sprayed with an unknown white substance, forcing the passengers to take shelter.The Washington Post wasn’t immediately able to verify whether the Madleen was in international waters at the time. Data from the ship-tracking website VesselFinder shows its last available position around 36 miles off the coast of Egypt at 1 a.m. local time Monday.Israel’s Foreign Ministry also posted a video on X early Monday that appeared to show Israeli military personnel handing out water and sandwiches to a group of people who were wearing life jackets and huddled together on a boat.The coalition released prerecorded messages from passengers, including Thunberg. “If you see this video, we have been intercepted and kidnapped in international waters by the Israeli occupational forces or forces that support Israel,” she said.The Madleen set off from Sicily on June 1 with 12 people, hailing from France, Sweden, Turkey, the Netherlands, Spain, Brazil and Germany. Among them were Thunberg, European Parliament member Rima Hassan, Al Jazeera presenter Omar Faiad, journalist Yanis Mhamdi and Freedom Flotilla Coalition organizers Yasemin Acar and Thiago Ávila.In a statement, Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said the Israeli intervention took place when the Madleen was in international waters, calling it a violation of international law and a “heinous act by the Netanyahu government, which threatens the freedom of navigation and maritime security.”French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told reporters Monday that the government had warned the flotilla’s passengers ahead of the journey of the risks of the trip and sent a clear statement to Israel to “avoid any incident.” Spain’s Foreign Ministry summoned the chargé d’affaires of the Israeli Embassy to protest the incident.The German Embassy in Israel is in touch with Israeli authorities about the Madleen and has offered consular assistance to one German citizen, German Ambassador Steffen Seibert said on social media.Before setting sail, the 22-year-old Thunberg said in an interview posted on Instagram that though the journey was risky, the thing she feared most was “the world’s silence,” which she said was “enabling genocide.” Israel has repeatedly denied allegations of genocide and has rejected claims that it is carrying out a humanitarian blockade.Israel has imposed varying forms of land, air and sea blockades on Gaza since 2007, arguing that its siege is justified to keep weapons away from Hamas. The blockade has tightened since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas militants. In early March, Israel blocked all medicine, food and fuel from entering the enclave for nearly three months in what it said was a bid to pressure Hamas.Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Sunday that he ordered the military to “take whatever measures are necessary” to prevent the Madleen from breaking the naval blockade and reaching Gaza. Some past boat missions led by international activists to reach Gaza have resulted in bloodshed. Israeli naval forces in 2010 raided a flotilla that included a Turkish ship, the Mavi Marmara, killing nine pro-Palestinian activists. That incident sparked international condemnation and a diplomatic crisis between Turkey and Israel.A United Nations report into the deadly 2010 incident found that while Israel’s naval blockade was a “legitimate security measure,” Israel’s decision to board the vessels with “such substantial force at a great distance from the blockade zone and with no final warning” was “excessive and unreasonable.” The panel also found that the flotilla had “no violent intentions” and was entitled to its political expression, but “acted recklessly in attempting to breach the naval blockade.”In the latest attempt, members of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition documented their sea journey on social media, posting live updates tracking the Madleen’s location. The group — which describes itself as a grassroots solidarity movement to support Palestinians through nonviolent action — said its passengers were not carrying weapons and were trained in nonviolent resistance.“Spirits are high because we know we sail with the hearts of billions of people who can’t stand seeing children being starved to death, who can’t stand hospitals being bombed, who can’t stand shelters and tents being burned with people inside or children amputated without anesthesia,” Ávila said in a social media post during the first sunrise on the boat.Marco Van Rennes, the Dutch skipper of the Madleen, said he was inspired to join the mission, his third with the group, by a sense of “moral duty.”About halfway through the journey, the Madleen made a stop to pick up four migrants who had jumped into the ocean from a deflating boat to evade Libyan authorities, the group said. The crew said it was responding to a Mayday call and had a “moral and legal duty to protect those rescued at sea.”Photos posted by Hassan showed several people swimming in the ocean from a small, overcrowded boat with what the group said was about 30 to 40 migrants. The four rescued people were from Sudan and joined the people aboard the Madleen, who called on European authorities to rescue the refugees and help find them a safe country where they could seek asylum.On Sunday night, Hassan began posting hourly updates on X as Israeli officials threatened to stop the boat. “It’s a dangerous night for us,” she wrote. “As soon as you don’t hear from me, it’s because the internet has been cut off and Israel is preparing to attack us.”In an update early Monday, Hassan said the crew of the Madleen had been “arrested by the Israeli army in international waters around 2 a.m.,” adding: “Actions are coming.”",
