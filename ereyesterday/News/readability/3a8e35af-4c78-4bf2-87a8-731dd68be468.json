  "text": "India and Pakistan have accused each other of \"violations\" hours after the two nations said they had agreed to a ceasefire following days of cross-border military strikes.After sounds of explosions were heard in Indian-administered Kashmir, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said there had been \"repeated violations of the understanding we arrived at\".A short while later, Pakistan's foreign ministry said it remained \"committed to faithful implementation of a ceasefire...notwithstanding the violations being committed by India in some areas\". The fighting between India and Pakistan over the last four days has been the worst military confrontation between the two rivals in decades.The use of drones, missiles and artillery started when India struck targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in response to a deadly militant attack in Pahalgam last month. Pakistan had denied any involvement. After four days of cross-border strikes, India and Pakistan said they had agreed on a full and immediate ceasfire. US President Donald Trump announced the news on his Truth Social Platform on Saturday morning. He said it had been brokered by the US. Pakistan's Foreign Minister later confirmed the agreement had been reached by the two countries, adding that \"three dozen countries\" were involved in the diplomacy. But hours after the announcement, residents - and BBC reporters - in the main Indian-administered Kashmiri cities of Srinagar and Jammu reported hearing the sounds of explosions and seeing flashes in the sky.Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said: \"For the last few hours, there have been repeated violations of the understanding we arrived at earlier this evening.\"This is a breach of the understanding arrived at earlier today.\"Misri said India's armed forces was \"giving an appropriate response\" and he concluded his briefing by \"calling upon Pakistan to address these violations\".In response, a spokesman for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: \"Pakistan remains committed to faithful implementation of ceasefire between Pakistan and India, announced earlier today.\"Notwithstanding the violations being committed by India in some areas, our forces are handling the situation with responsibility and restraint.\"We believe that any issues in smooth implementation of the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at appropriate levels.\"The troops on ground should also exercise restraint.\"Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.It has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed nations and they have fought two wars over it.Confirming the ceasefire, India's external affairs minister S Jaishankar said the two nations had \"worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action\".\"India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so,\" he added. Later, in an address to the nation, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the ceasefire had been reached \"for the benefit of everybody\".Speaking after the ceasefire announcement, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said India and Pakistan had agreed to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.He said he and US Vice-President JD Vance had spent 48 hours with senior Indian and Pakistani officials, including their respective Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he welcomed \"all efforts to de-escalate the conflict\".UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Britain has been \"engaged\" in talks for \"some days\", with Foreign Secretary David Lammy speaking to both sides.\"I'm pleased to see today that there's a ceasefire,\" Sir Keir said. \"The task now is to make sure that that is enduring and is lasting.\"The recent fighting came after two weeks of tension following the killing of 26 tourists in the resort town of Pahalgam.Survivors of the 22 April attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed 25 Indians and one Nepali national, said the militants were singling out Hindu men.The Indian defence ministry said its strikes this week were part of a \"commitment\" to hold \"accountable\" those responsible for the attack. Pakistan described them as \"unprovoked\".Pakistan said Indian air strikes and cross-border fire since Wednesday had killed 36 people in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, while India's army reported at least 21 civilians deaths from Pakistani shelling.Fighting intensified overnight on Friday, with both countries accusing each other of targeting airbases and other military sites.",
