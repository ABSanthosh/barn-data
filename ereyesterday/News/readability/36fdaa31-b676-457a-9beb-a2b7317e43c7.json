  "text": "BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday blasted Vice President JD Vance for his support of the far right in the country that gave rise to Adolf Hitler, accusing the American vice president of interfering in domestic affairs less than 10 days before national elections.Vance’s denunciation of efforts by the German establishment to keep the far right out of power sparked a wave of condemnation from senior officials and pundits, some of whom saw a U.S. administration actively promoting political extremism in the West.Vance on Friday used a major security conference in Munich to criticize the country’s political fire wall: the post-World War II agreement by mainstream parties to block the far right from being part of any government. Vance punctuated his point by later meeting with Alice Weidel, the co-leader of the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, which is polling in second place. The AfD denies being a far-right party but is classified by German intelligence as a suspected extremist group. One of the party’s most polemic figures has been convicted and fined for using a banned Nazi slogan.Vance’s comments appeared to shatter a taboo. On Saturday, Scholz criticized him for visiting the Dachau concentration camp on Thursday only to meet with and voice support for far-right leaders hours later.In a keynote address, Scholz noted that the United States helped overthrow Nazism. “‘Never again’ is the historical mission that Germany, as a free democracy, must and wants to continue to live up to day after day,” he said. “Never again fascism, never again racism, never again war of aggression.”“A commitment to ‘never again’ is therefore incompatible with support for the AfD,” Scholz said, to resounding applause. “That is why we will not accept outsiders intervening in our democracy, in our elections and in the democratic formation of opinion on behalf of this party.”Vance’s moves offered a sobering illustration of the extent to which the Trump administration is willing to directly align with and boost Europe’s hard-right nationalists who have espoused anti-migrant, anti-LGBTQ+ and pro-Russian views.For Europe and especially Germany, it was a wake-up call. Traditional politicians in Europe now find themselves caught between an unorthodox, mercurial leader in Washington and a belligerent strongman in Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin has worked for decades to undermine liberal democracy in Europe. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has threatened to squeeze European allies through a trade war and raised concerns he’ll sideline them in talks with Putin over the Russian invasion of Ukraine.The message from the Trump administration, said Jackson Janes, a resident senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, is: “We are in charge of the [right-wing] movement, and we want that movement to be supported elsewhere around the globe and in Europe in particular.”European leaders also face a growing challenge from nationalist parties at home. In neighboring Austria, the far-right Freedom Party won a plurality in last September’s election. The Freedom Party this past week narrowly failed to cobble together the first far-right-led government in the German-speaking world since the fall of the Third Reich in 1945.The AfD is now aiming for a spot in the next German government, though other parties have continued to refuse to work with it. On Saturday, the German outlet Der Spiegel described Vance as “unashamedly” interfering in the election campaign.“It is evidently the aim of Donald Trump, JD Vance and Elon Musk to ensure that a party like the AfD comes to power in Germany,” the outlet said. “The reasons for this are probably complex. One of them: a strong [European Union] stands in the way of Trump, Musk and Co. The AfD wants an end to the E.U. in its current form. Their interests overlap.”Vance is not the first member of the Trump team to back the AfD. Musk, the tech billionaire who has become a Trump intimate, has endorsed the party repeatedly. He hosted a chat with Weidel on his platform X in January, and again called the AfD Germany’s “only hope.”Weidel said during the call that it was wrong to describe Hitler as right-wing: “He was nothing other than an antisemitic socialist.”Musk later told an AfD rally that Germany should move “beyond” its historical guilt.“There is too much focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that,” he said. “Children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great-grandparents.”Vance shocked the security conference in Munich by taking aim not at Russia and China but at Western Europe, where he claimed leaders were failing to address illegal migration and were suppressing free speech by seeking to weed out misinformation, much of which emanates from Russia.“The threat that I worry most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia, not China, it’s not any other external actor,” he said. “What I worry about is the threat from within.”He referred to AfD supporters without naming the party: “What no democracy — American, German or European — will survive, is telling millions of voters that their thoughts and concerns, their aspirations, their pleas for relief, are invalid and unworthy of even being considered,” he said. “Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There’s no room for fire walls.”Vance and Weidel met later for about 30 minutes. The AfD is calling for an end to arms deliveries to Ukraine and sanctions on Russia. They discussed topics including Ukraine, freedom of speech and the “fire wall against the right,” an AfD spokesman said.“The Trump administration has also recognized that a migration turnaround can only be achieved with the AfD,” Weidel wrote on X.The AfD is accused of harboring and legitimizing extremist, nativist and anti-immigrant views. The right-wing populist block of the European Parliament expelled it after a string of controversies, including a comment by one of its lawmakers, Maximilian Krah, that Nazi SS officers were “not all criminals.” An AfD leader in the eastern state of Thuringia, Björn Höcke, has twice been convicted and fined for using banned Nazi slogans.Migration is the party’s central and overriding theme, but it has embraced others that echo Trump. If it came to power, Weidel has said, it would launch “large-scale repatriations,” close Germany’s borders and cut benefits to asylum seekers. The party has criticized Germany’s shift from fossil fuels and what it describes as “transgender hype” and “woke society.”Weidel is in a long-term relationship with a woman with whom she has two adopted children, but she rejects the term “queer” as used by LGBTQ+ activists. Her party explicitly states that the definition of family is a father, mother and child.In Germany, the AfD is not barred from running candidates for office, campaigning or winning votes, and Weidel has participated in debates. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius accused Vance of painting a distorted picture of democracy in Europe and Germany by hyperbolically comparing it to “authoritarian regimes.”Democracy, he said, makes it possible for “partially extremist parties like the AfD to campaign quite normally, just like any other party.” The real risk to democracy, he said, is the forces from within that would seek to undermine it.“Democracy must be able to defend itself against the extremists who want to destroy it,” he said.Germany’s next government is likely to be led by conservative Christian Democratic Union chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz. After meeting with Vance on Friday, Merz said he and the vice president “reaffirmed the special importance of transatlantic relations.” He later described Vance’s speech as a “little short of interfering.”On a Saturday panel in Munich, Merz celebrated free speech as part of democracy, but said fake news and hate speech are legal offenses. He took a jab at the White House for banning an Associated Press reporter over the outlet’s refusal to replace “Gulf of Mexico” with “Gulf of America.”“We would never kick out a news agency out of the press room of our chancellor,” he said, to applause.Faiola reported from Rome.
