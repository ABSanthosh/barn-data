  "text": "The House of Representatives on Thursday approved President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" and moved it a key step closer to becoming law, sending the legislation to the Senate after a harried week of last-minute changes and two tense all-night debates. In the end, House Speaker Mike Johnson muscled through the more than 1,000-page package of tax cuts, trims to the government's social safety net, and new Washington spending on the narrowest of votes: 215-214. Republican Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massie of Kentucky joined all Democrats in opposing the measure. GOP Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland voted present. \"It quite literally is morning in America,\" Johnson quipped Monday just before a final vote that came a little before 7 am ET. Trump followed up after passage by calling it “arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed\" and asking the Senate to approve it quickly. The final push for the package began on Wednesday evening with the release of a 42-page manager's amendment that offered a series of changes, most notably a more generous deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) as well as more stringent work requirements for the Medicaid program. The plan will also raise the nation's debt ceiling by $4 trillion after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned America's borrowing authority is at the \"warning track\" and could be exhausted by August. Read more: What is the US debt ceiling, and how does it impact you? The tab for all these changes is set to be sizable, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) finding that the bill will lead to over $3 trillion in new red ink over the next decade. The CBO also released an analysis this week stating the bill's effect would lead to the bottom 10% of Americans seeing their household resources reduced by 4% — largely through cuts to federal spending on Medicaid and food aid — while the top 10% would see an increase in their resources by 2%. That analysis further fueled the Democratic charges that the bill amounted to little more than a giveaway to the rich. Democratic House leadership slammed the package after the vote, saying it \"rips healthcare and food assistance away from millions of people in order to provide tax cuts to the wealthy, the well-off and the well-connected.\" The bill will also reshape numerous corners of the American government if it is signed into law, with new spending included for action on the southern border, for the US military, for education cuts in areas like Pell Grants, as well as other areas.",
