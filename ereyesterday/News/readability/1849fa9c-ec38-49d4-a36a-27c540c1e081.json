  "text": "Indian researcher Badar Khan Suri arrested in US (Image Credit: X)A US federal judge intervened Thursday, blocking the deportation of Badar Khan Suri, an Indian-origin academic at Georgetown University who was detained over alleged Hamas connections.Legal representatives for the post-doctoral researcher Suri called for his immediate release, describing the arrest as a \"targeted, retaliatory detention\" aimed at \"silence, or at the very least restrict and chill, his speech\" and others who \"express support for Palestinian rights.\"Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles issued an order stating Suri \"shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the court issues a contrary order.\" The ACLU reported Suri's detention at an immigration facility in Louisiana, according to AFP.ACLU attorney Sophia Gregg stated that forcibly removing someone from their residence and family based on political views represents an unconstitutional attempt to suppress dissent.Georgetown University confirmed Suri's valid visa status for doctoral research on peacebuilding. They stated no knowledge of illegal activities or reasons for his detention.Suri's arrest occurred Monday at his Arlington residence. A Department of Homeland Security representative claimed he was spreading Hamas propaganda and had connections to a suspected terrorist advisor.A DHS spokesperson had told CBS News that Suri was a \"foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media. \"The spokesperson further alleged that Suri maintained \"close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior adviser to Hamas.\"Secretary of state Marco Rubio on March 15 determined that \"Suri's activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act, according to the spokesperson.However, court documents indicate neither Rubio nor other officials have accused Suri of any legal violations. The detention appears linked to family connections and protected speech.The State Department deemed Suri deportable under provisions concerning threats to US foreign policy. Georgetown affirmed its support for open academic discourse.According to legal documents, Suri's spouse is an American citizen with Palestinian heritage. They believe their opposition to US policies regarding Israel led to their targeting.",
