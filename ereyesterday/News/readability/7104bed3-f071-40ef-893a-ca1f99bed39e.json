  "text": "Luigi Mangione (Picture credit: Reuters)Luigi Mangione, accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was indicted for murder in Manhattan on Tuesday.Mangione faces 11 charges, including first-degree murder and murder as an act of terrorism. The indictment alleges that he killed Thompson to “influence the policy of a unit of government by intimidation or coercion.”\"This type of premeditated, targeted gun violence cannot and will not be tolerated,\" Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg said. 'Killing intended to evoke terror'Bragg described Thompson’s death as “a killing intended to evoke terror. And we’ve seen that reaction.” The murder sparked widespread outrage against US health insurance companies, with many sharing personal stories of coverage denials and exorbitant medical bills. \"Wanted\" posters featuring other healthcare executives appeared in New York and on social media after the shooting.A post-9/11 New York law permits terrorism charges for crimes meant to intimidate the public or influence government policy through violence. Bragg said the location of the murder, a busy Manhattan area during the workday, supports the terrorism charge. \"This was a frightening, well-planned, targeted murder that was intended to cause shock and attention and intimidation,\" Bragg told reporters.The arrest and extradition processMangione was initially charged with murder on December 9 after a five-day manhunt. He was apprehended in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and is currently being held there on gun charges. New York prosecutors are working to extradite him.Killing of Brian ThompsonMangione allegedly attacked Thompson, 50, while he was walking to a Manhattan conference. Authorities say the crime was motivated by frustrations with the insurance giant. When Mangione was arrested in Pennsylvania, police found multiple fake IDs, a US passport, and writings about the insurance industry, including a manifesto praising filmmaker Michael Moore’s critique of healthcare.Mangione is being held without bail in Pennsylvania on gun and forgery charges. His lawyer has questioned the evidence against him.Who is Luigi Mangione?Mangione, an Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland family, is believed to have acted out of anger at the US healthcare system. A letter found in his possession reportedly labeled health insurers as “parasitic” and condemned corporate greed. He frequently posted on social media about his own back surgery and encouraged others to be assertive with doctors and insurers.UnitedHealthcare confirmed that Mangione was never a client. His family reported him missing in November, and on December 7, New York police interviewed his mother, who indicated the crime was something he might do. The family has since expressed shock and devastation at his arrest. Investigators are still determining any connection between his health struggles and the shooting.Upcoming court hearingsMangione has two Pennsylvania court hearings scheduled for Thursday, including an extradition hearing.",
