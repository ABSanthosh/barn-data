Which speaking with OnTrac, they said that’s not true at all. (It was) fantastic work by our night shift officers looking beyond the brake light violation.”Police say Crumble is a contract worker for OnTrac. Now, she is facing a number of criminal charges.“The best thing people can do is just keep up to date with where your packages are, and when they should be arriving, and notifying the company and police, if necessary,” Buchanan said.Detectives have identified some victims, but they are still going through a very long list of names, contacting potential victims.Newell asked OnTrac if Crumble is still employed as a contract delivery driver, but so far, she hasn’t heard back.",
