Mr. Grossi told Radio France Internationale in an interview that while evaluating the damage from the strikes using satellite images alone was difficult, given the power of the bombs dropped on Fordo and the technical characteristics of the plant, “we already know that these centrifuges are no longer operational.”The centrifuges — giant machines that spin at supersonic speeds to enrich uranium — require a high degree of precision and are vulnerable to intense vibrations, he said. “There was no escaping significant physical damage,” Mr. Grossi said. “So we can come to a fairly accurate technical conclusion.”He said, however, that it would be “too much” to assert that Iran’s nuclear program had been “wiped out” after the Israeli and American bombing campaign. Mr. Grossi noted that not all of Iran’s nuclear sites had been struck, and said Iranian officials had told him that they would take “protective measures” for the uranium they had already enriched.Still, he said, the nuclear program has definitely suffered “enormous damage.”He declined to say how far Iran’s nuclear program had been set back.“Perhaps decades, in relation to what? In relation to what type of activity or objectives?” Mr. Grossi said when asked about comments made this week by President Trump at a NATO summit in the Netherlands.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
