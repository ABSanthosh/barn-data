  "text": "Here’s the latest.Wall Street ended another turbulent day of trading with a small decline on Monday, as false reports about a potential tariff reprieve sent stocks gyrating before President Trump’s threat of additional tariffs on China restored the potential for a severe economic downturn.Mr. Trump on Monday issued a new ultimatum to China to rescind its retaliatory tariffs on the United States, or face additional tariffs of 50 percent beginning Wednesday. The threat came as governments around the world raced to schedule phone calls, send delegations to Washington and submit proposals to lower their import taxes to escape the tariffs. Mr. Trump and his advisers have offered conflicting signals on whether the United States is willing to negotiate.Mr. Trump’s trade war made investors increasingly pessimistic about the economy but he defended his global tariffs, saying those in place had already brought the United States billions of dollars in revenue.The S\u0026P 500, the benchmark U.S. index, swung between steep losses — as much as 4.7 percent — and gains, before ending the day down 0.2 percent.Earlier, shares in Asian and European markets extended their sell-off. The S\u0026P 500, which is 17.6 percent below its February peak, was close to tumbling into a bear market, defined as a drop at the end of a trading day of 20 percent or more from a recent high.The recent rout in global markets reflected deepening concern that Mr. Trump’s significant new taxes on U.S. imports could disrupt global supply chains, cause inflation to accelerate and set off a severe economic downturn.“This one is likely to last a while given the intransigence of the Trump administration on the issue of tariffs,” said Ed Yardeni, the veteran Wall Street analyst. “The stock market clearly believes this is a disastrous policy.”Mr. Trump showed no sign of pulling back from his tariffs, saying in a social media post on Monday morning that the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates, a move that the Fed chairman has warned could fuel inflation. Earlier, Mr. Trump had dismissed concerns that his steep new taxes on imports would lead to higher prices, calling them “a very beautiful thing.”Here’s what else to know:Reduction efforts: Several Asian countries sought a reprieve from the tariffs. Bangladesh and Vietnam asked Mr. Trump to delay imposing the tariffs, while the Philippines said it would reduce tariffs on goods coming from the United States. South Korea and Japan said they wanted to meet with the Trump administration.Asia and Europe: The main stock index in Hong Kong, where many mainland Chinese companies trade, plunged 13 percent. In Taiwan, a hub for global technology, stocks lost 10 percent of their value. European markets closed sharply lower. The benchmark Pan-European index, the Stoxx Europe 600, was down 4.5 percent, and the FTSE 100 in London was down 4.4 percent.Commodities prices: Benchmark Brent crude oil prices, which briefly dipped below $60 a barrel on Sunday, were down more than 2 percent on Monday. Copper prices are also dropping.Cryptocurrency: Since Mr. Trump announced his global tariffs last week, the price of Bitcoin has plunged 10 percent, dropping below $78,000 on Sunday night. The decline shows that Bitcoin, often pitched as a stable long-term source of value, is still subject to market gyrations.Your money: The market turmoil has caused worry for many people, not least those nearing retirement who may need to access funds in the near future. But timing the market on this or any other basis is hazardous, experts say.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who, along with Jamieson Greer, the United States trade representative, was put in charge of negotiations with Japan, signaled in an interview this afternoon that Trump is ready to negotiate. “President Trump, as you know, is better than anyone at giving himself maximum leverage,” he said. Bessent said he had suggested that foreign officials “keep your cool, do not escalate and come to us with your offers.” He added: “And at a point, President Trump will be ready to negotiate.” These comments contradict an interview this morning by Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser, who said there would be no negotiations.The S\u0026P 500 fell 0.2 percent today, capping off a tumultuous day of trading that at one point pulled the benchmark into bear market territory, or a drop of 20 percent or more from its recent high. The index is almost 18 percent below its mid-February peak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index, which also saw dramatic swings throughout the day, ended slightly higher.Major U.S. stock indexes came into this week on the heels of a two-day rout that caused the S\u0026P 500 to register its worst week since March 2020, the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Concern that Trump’s sweeping tariffs — and responses from other countries — will sink global growth and fuel inflation is still driving sentiment on Wall Street.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Tariffs will make this country very rich,” Trump insisted. Millions of Americans may not be feeling that way right now.Trump says “virtually every country wants to negotiate” and that “if I didn’t do what I did over the last couple of weeks” no countries would want to negotiate. That includes Israel offering to cut their tariffs on American products today, he said.ImageCredit...Eric Lee/The New York TimesTrump says the reason he hasn’t imposed tariffs again Russia is because “we’re not doing business essentially with Russia.” The United States did not put tariffs on Russia, North Korea, Cuba or Belarus because the U.S. already has substantial sanctions on those countries. Still, the $3 billion of imports the United States brought in from Russia last year is much larger than some of the tiny countries Trump targeted.As Trump vowed to maintain his sweeping tariff policies, he gave a rosy, exaggerated picture of the current economy, saying that price inflation on “everything is down at levels that nobody ever thought possible.” Inflation eased more than expected in February, but prices were still up 2.8 percent from a year earlier. Even before the tariffs were announced, economists were bracing for higher prices and slower growth.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe European Union has floated that it could reduce tariffs on American cars and industrial goods to zero if the United States does the same in return. Asked if that is a good enough offer, Trump said, “No it’s not. The E.U. has been very tough over the years.”VideotranscripttranscriptReporter: “The E.U. has said that they have offered zero for zero tariffs on cars and industrial goods. Is that not enough?” “Well the E.U. — no it’s not. The E.U. has been very tough over the years. It was, I always say it was formed to really do damage to the United States in trade. The European Union has been very — very bad to us. They don’t take our cars, like Japan in that sense. They don’t take our agricultural product. They don’t take anything practically.”Asked if his tariffs would drive other countries into the arms of China, Trump says, “I’m not worried.” He adds, “They don’t want to be in the hands of the Chinese.”Trump says he will pursue deals with many countries. “We’re going to get fair deals and good deals with everybody. And if we don’t, we’re going to have nothing to do with them. They’re not going to be allowed to participate in the United States,” he said.“We’re not looking at that,” Trump says when asked about a potential pause on tariffs.VideoAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Trump are now speaking after a meeting in the Oval Office. Netanyahu begins by thanking the U.S., and says Israel will “eliminate” the trade deficit with the U.S. “Free trade has to be fair trade,” Netanyahu says, adding that Israel will get rid of its tariffs “quickly.”“That’s very nice, thank you,” Trump replies.VideoThe leading U.S. business lobby warns tariffs could inflict ‘major harm.’ImageThe group’s chief executive said that President Trump’s tariffs could hurt U.S. businesses and workers.Credit...Scott McIntyre for The New York TimesOne of the country’s most influential business lobbies is warning that the sweeping tariffs unveiled by the White House last week will cause “major harm” to manufacturers and workers.Last week, Joshua Bolten, the chief executive of the Business Roundtable, said that while his group supported the president’s goal of achieving fairer trade deals, the damage to the economy from the measures that President Trump proposed “will increase the longer the tariffs are in place and may be exacerbated by retaliatory measures.”Mr. Bolten’s statement was the fourth time this year the group commented on the threat of new tariffs against the country’s major trading partners.On March 12, the Business Roundtable’s survey of 150 chief executives, polled in late February and early March when Mr. Trump threatened tariffs against Canada and Mexico, showed growing pessimism about the United States’ economic outlook. The survey, called the Business Roundtable C.E.O. Economic Outlook Index, fell in the first quarter to 7 points, roughly where it was in mid-2024. Expectations for hiring, capital investment and sales all fell.Chuck Robbins, the chair of the group and the chief executive of Cisco, said last month that not all tariffs were harmful, but that businesses wanted certainty about the levies so they could adapt if needed.“Markets want clarity,” he said in an interview with Punchbowl News. “Companies want clarity, and the fear is that companies begin to do the classic, you know, ‘I’m just going to pause investments now until we understand this a little bit better.’”Stephan Miran, the top White House economist, was asked today in Washington about the White House giving mixed signals about whether it would negotiate on its tariffs or not. “There are conflicting narratives because everybody has got an opinion,” Miran said. “And that’s fine.” He added that President Trump would make the decision, and that the president’s history “on the creation of deals is pretty great.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStephen Miran, the chair of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, said at an event at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank, on Monday that President Trump would be the ultimate decider about whether to accept the concessions that foreign countries are offering to avoid tariffs. He said offers by foreign countries “would be welcomed by the United States,” and that the president had been “very clear that we want increased access to foreign markets that would boost our exports.”A top White House adviser indicates that offers from trading partners won’t convince Trump to retreat.ImagePeter Navarro, right, a trade adviser to President Trump, defended the administration’s tariff policy on Monday. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, is at left in the Oval Office last month.Credit...Eric Lee/The New York TimesPeter Navarro, a senior White House trade adviser, on Monday defended the sweeping tariffs President Trump has imposed on foreign nations and indicated that other countries’ offers to drop their own tariffs on American products would be insufficient to convince the president to retreat.Mr. Navarro, who has been the architect of many of President Trump’s trade plans, said on CNBC that the United States was facing a national emergency based on chronic trade deficits, and the only fix would be foreign countries removing trade barriers that had hindered the flow of American goods.The European Union offered Monday to drop its tariffs on American cars and industrial goods to zero if the United States did the same. But Mr. Navarro criticized the bloc for its value-added taxes and restrictions on American meat exports, as well as systematically higher tariffs.“You steal from the American people every which way is possible,” Mr. Navarro said. “So, don’t just say we’re going to lower our tariffs.”Mr. Navarro also targeted Vietnam, which has appealed to the president in recent days to have its tariffs reduced. He accused Vietnam of dumping products into U.S. markets, engaging in intellectual property theft and killing industries like shrimp, kitchen cabinets and others.“When they come to us and say, we’ll go to zero tariffs, that means nothing to us, because it’s the non-tariff cheating that matters,” Mr. Navarro said.But Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who, with Jamieson Greer, the United States trade representative, was put in charge of negotiations with Japan, signaled in an interview later in the day that Mr. Trump is ready to negotiate. “President Trump, as you know, is better than anyone at giving himself maximum leverage,” he said. Mr. Bessent said he had suggested that foreign officials “keep your cool, do not escalate and come to us with your offers.” He added: “And at a point, President Trump will be ready to negotiate.”In the CNBC interview in the morning, Mr. Navarro said that tax cuts were forthcoming, as well as other benefits for Americans, like deregulation, lower energy prices, lower interest rates and the restructuring of manufacturing.“We’re going to get to a place where America makes stuff again, real wages are going to be up, profits are going to be up,” he said, adding, “the market’s going to find a bottom.” Stock markets closed slightly lower Monday, following two days of punishing losses last week.He was also asked about Elon Musk’s very public criticism of tariffs and of Mr. Navarro specifically over the weekend. Responding to a social-media post praising Mr. Navarro, Mr. Musk on Saturday mocked Mr. Navarro’s Ivy League degree as useless, and then said Mr. Navarro had not “built” anything.On Monday, Mr. Navarro said that Mr. Musk was “not a car manufacturer” but “a car assembler,” mentioning that Tesla’s plant in Texas imported batteries, electronics, tires and other parts. “He wants the cheap foreign parts, and we understand that,” he said.The White House has canceled a press conference in the East Room between President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel this afternoon and instead will have the two take questions in the Oval Office, a White House official said. Trump’s sweeping tariffs did not spare Israel. Netanyahu’s office said before his visit that the two men planned to discuss the tariff issue.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPrices for copper and other metals fall sharply as recession fears grow.ImageCopper is used widely, including in cars, appliances, electronics and in many industries that produce and consume electricity.Credit...Oliver Bunic/BloombergFears that trade tensions will cause a global recession are weighing on a closely watched economic barometer: the price of copper.The price of the metal — used in many products and industries — shows how President Trump’s tariffs and tariff threats have driven the cost of certain commodities higher before causing them to collapse.Copper prices surged this year, and reached a high after Mr. Trump said his administration was investigating whether tariffs might be necessary to reduce the United States’ reliance on copper imports. Copper buyers rushed to purchase the metal before any tariffs took effect.Then last week, Mr. Trump imposed “reciprocal” tariffs on most countries, terrifying many investors and business executives because of the tariffs’ potential to sharply slow the economy and perhaps even cause a recession. As a result, copper prices plunged, and are now down nearly 20 percent from last month’s high.“With growth in the U.S. likely to slow on the back of tariffs, and China already struggling to revive its economy, demand for copper and other industrial metals is likely to weaken,” said Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING.Copper is used widely, including in cars, appliances, electronics and many industries that produce and consume electricity. Last year, the United States imported about half the copper it used, excluding scrap, according to ING.Prices of other metals are also under pressure.Mr. Trump’s 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum imports went into effect last month. But the prices of these metals have weakened in recent days as fears of a recession have intensified. The prices of “hot rolled coil” steel have fallen more than 10 percent since last month, and aluminum is down nearly 15 percent.“If trade tensions intensify and we see more retaliatory measures, this will add to the bearish sentiment for industrial metals,” Ms. Manthey said.Separately, the Trump administration said on Monday that it would conduct a new national security review of the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel, a Japanese steel producer. The Biden administration had performed its own review and blocked the deal in January.In a statement on Monday, U.S. Steel said, “We look forward to continuing to work closely with President Trump and his administration to finalize this significant and important investment, which will preserve existing jobs, create new jobs, enhance national security and secure a bright future for American manufacturing.”Trump threatens huge tariffs on China in response to Beijing’s retaliation.ImagePresident Trump threatened China with additional tariffs.Credit...Jade Gao/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesPresident Trump said on Monday that he does not plan to pause a slate of expansive tariffs set to take effect later this week, as he threatened to subject Chinese imports to a staggering 104 percent tax in a bid to ward off retaliation by Beijing and other powers.Mr. Trump issued his warning on a day when the White House once again found itself on the defensive for its spiraling global trade war. But the president insisted he remained unbowed by the widening range of governments pleading for relief and the markets convulsing anew over the chaos and confusion.“We’re not looking at that,” Mr. Trump said, when asked about a possible pause on his tariffs. “We’re going to have one shot at this and no other president is going to do what I’m doing.”Mr. Trump began the day by drawing new battle lines over his so-called reciprocal tariffs, which he plans to impose on certain countries after midnight on Wednesday. The taxes, which can reach as high as 46 percent for some nations, will snap into effect just days after the president imposed a minimum 10 percent levy on nearly every U.S. trading partner.Mr. Trump specifically targeted China, which announced last week it would match the United States by imposing a retaliatory 34 percent tax on imports from America. In a post on Truth Social, the president demanded that Beijing rescind its retribution or face an additional 50 percent U.S. tariff beginning April 9. He also threatened to halt any further negotiations.The escalation could bring the U.S. tariff on Chinese goods to 104 percent, though for some products, the rate is likely to be much higher because of levies that date back to Mr. Trump’s first term. Taken together, it could prove costly for importers bringing in clothing, cellphones, chemicals and machinery from China. American consumers last year bought $440 billion of goods from China, making it the second-largest source of U.S. imports after Mexico.Mr. Trump coupled his ultimatum to China with a pledge to issue punishing, additional tariffs on other U.S. trading partners if they similarly try to rebuff his policies. But his attacks did not appear to dissuade some opponents, including the European Union, where officials prepared to circulate a list of U.S. products that they could soon subject to retaliation.With global tensions rising, Mr. Trump’s strategy triggered another day of unease on Wall Street. The S\u0026P 500 fell 0.2 percent, now almost 18 percent below its mid-February peak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index, which also saw dramatic swings throughout the day, ended slightly higher.In a sign of investor frustration over the tariffs, an erroneous news report earlier in the day, suggesting that the president might pause his trade war, sparked an immediate rally — only to see stocks just as quickly plummet again, after the White House made clear no such pause was in the offing.Still, administration officials appeared to leave open the door for negotiations that could ultimately defuse the trade war, citing the fact that more than 50 countries — including, most recently, Israel, Japan and Vietnam — had approached the U.S. government in recent days to strike deals. After visiting with the president at the White House, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged Monday that his country would “eliminate the trade deficit with the United States,” while reducing other trade barriers “fairly quickly.”But White House officials have sought to set a high bar for what the president is willing to accept, marking a shift in tone after Mr. Trump and his aides initially signaled they would not haggle over tariffs at all.“If they come to us with really great deals that advantage American manufacturing and American farmers, I’m sure he’ll listen,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said in an interview on Fox News.Mr. Hassett said some nations had proposed “some deals that are great,” but added of the president: “After decades and decades of mistreating American workers, it’s going to be tough to get him to decide to really come to the table and sign on the dotted line.”Peter Navarro, a senior White House trade adviser, specifically said that other nations needed to do more than lower their own tariffs to secure relief from the United States. Appearing on CNBC, he cited a need to reduce “cheating” and other barriers that restrict American goods in foreign markets.And Stephen Miran, the head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said offers by foreign countries “would be welcomed by the United States.” He added at an event in Washington that the president had been “very clear that we want increased access to foreign markets that would boost our exports.”With seemingly no end to the trade war in sight, economists once again were left to grapple with the prospect that high tariffs could raise prices on consumers, slow U.S. growth and tip the country into a recession. Tariffs are taxes on imports, which businesses may struggle to afford, potentially resulting in those firms passing on the new costs to customers.Jay Foreman, the chief executive of toy company Basic Fun, called the president’s new threat against China “unhinged.”Mr. Foreman said he had just initiated a complete hold on all shipments of his products from Asia. “I cannot risk putting any product on the water that might incur, at this point, a 54 percent to 104 percent tariff,” he said. “It’s one thing to try to absorb or pass along 10 percent to 20 percent, but 54 percent to 104 percent, it’s impossible. The consumer will just shut down.”Jeanna Smialek and Danielle Kaye contributed reporting.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTLaurence D. Fink, chief executive of the giant asset manager BlackRock, said today that most chief executives he had been speaking with “would say we’re probably in a recession right now.” Speaking at a lunch at the Economic Club of New York, he told the audience: “The economy is weakening as we speak.” Most Americans don’t understand the extent of how the tariffs will affect them. Barbie dolls, he said, will become more expensive because many toys are made in China.European markets closed sharply lower. The FTSE 100 in London was down 4.4 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 closed with a 4.5 percent decline, with every sector in the red.Mexico has not yet ruled out imposing 25 percent levies on American steel and aluminum products, but wants “to avoid reciprocal tariffs as much as possible,” President Claudia Sheinbaum said during her daily news conference. The government wants to protect the Mexican industry, she added, but placing its own tariffs on American goods, as Canada has done, would elevate prices in Mexico. “We prefer to continue the dialogue before any other measure,” Sheinbaum said, adding that the Mexican economy minister, Marcelo Ebrard, would travel to Washington this week again to resume negotiations.ImageCredit...Yuri Cortez/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesA White House official says the tariffs that President Trump this morning threatened to impose on China — which would counter Beijing’s retaliation against Trump’s tariffs — are “additive,” which means that he would be imposing a 104 percent tariff on Chinese goods as of April 9. This is a huge surcharge on foreign products. Importers bringing in clothing, cell phones, chemicals and machinery from China will see the cost of their imports double. American consumers last year bought $440 billion of goods from China, the second-largest source of U.S. imports after Mexico.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPresident Trump’s tariffs have raised the risk of a recession this year in Europe and are likely to deal a severe blow to the volume of global trade, Moody’s ratings agency said in a new analysis today. Ireland, Slovakia, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Austria are the most vulnerable countries in Europe because value-added exports to America represent over 1 percent of their economic output. If the trans-Atlantic relationship were to deteriorate into an all-out trade war, the ratings agency added, then European consumers and supply chains will face further pain.How a false report on a 90-day pause on tariffs made markets swing wildly.ImageAn influential X account amplified a post on social media, which led to sways in the market.Credit...Ashley Gilbertson for The New York TimesThe news seemed big: That the Trump administration was considering a 90-day pause to his expansive tariffs.The problem was, it wasn’t true.But in a sign of the precarious nature of the markets right now, an unsubstantiated online report spiked shares sharply, albeit briefly, and continued to climb after CNBC and Reuters relayed the claim. The White House quickly responded saying that the report was “FAKE NEWS,” and CNBC and Reuters issued statements correcting the record.Stocks fell back down after those corrections. Still, the fallout continued to reverberate on Monday, and became a cautionary tale of the risk of using information drawn from the fast-moving echo chamber of social media without first confirming the news independently.Asked earlier in the day about the possibility of a pause on imposing the expansive tariffs announced by President Trump last week, Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, said on Fox News: “I think the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide.”Walter Bloomberg, an influential X account that is unaffiliated with Bloomberg News, amplified a post on social media claiming Mr. Hassett had said Mr. Trump was considering a 90-day pause in tariffs.Minutes after the Walter Bloomberg account’s post, Carl Quintanilla, a CNBC anchor, read a headline on air echoing the reports about Hassett. “I think we can go with this headline,” Mr. Quintanilla said, without attributing the news. A person with knowledge of the editorial process at the network said Mr. Quintanilla had read a CNBC headline that was circulated prematurely by mistake.After that, Reuters flashed a headline, citing CNBC. The Walter Bloomberg account later deleted the post. In a direct message on X, the account said to The New York Times that the post had originated minutes earlier from another X account. “Given the market movement — plus 4.5 percent — I deemed the headline reliable and posted it at 10:13,” the Walter Bloomberg account said in the direct message. “A few minutes later, Reuters picked up the story, citing CNBC.”CNBC issued a correction soon after mentioning the potential pause, saying its “aired unconfirmed information in a banner,” adding that its reporters “quickly made a correction on air.” Reuters also issued a correction, saying its report relied on a headline from CNBC. “Reuters has withdrawn the incorrect report and regrets its error,” it said in a statement.President Trump on Monday issued China a new ultimatum: Rescind its retaliatory tariffs on the United States, or be subject to additional tariffs of 50 percent beginning Wednesday. The president said on Truth Social that he would also cease negotiations with China if it does not withdraw its plan to put a 34 percent tariff on U.S. goods. In issuing his new threat to China, Trump also took aim at other countries contemplating their next moves in response to expansive U.S. tariffs set to take effect later this week. He pointed to his past threat that “any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs.” Still, the president said negotiations with other countries would “begin taking place immediately.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe S\u0026P 500 is still moving around as investors try to get to the bottom of the unsubstantiated report that the Trump administration was considering a 90-day pause to the tariffs. Currently the index is roughly flat for the day.U.S. markets swung wildly this morning on an unsubstantiated report that President Trump was considering a 90-day pause to his expansive tariffs. The White House has not announced any change in policy. Asked earlier in the day about the possibility of a pause, Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, said on Fox News: “I think the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide.” The White House later called the report “FAKE NEWS” on one of its official accounts on X.ImageCredit...Michael M.

The industry employs roughly four million people in the world’s 10th most populous country.More than 80 percent of Bangladesh’s exports are ready-made garments. Until this week, the United States was buying almost half.Kevin Hassett, the head of the White House National Economic Council, said on Sunday that the White House had received offers from about 50 countries interested in making deals to ease Mr. Trump’s expansive tariffs. But Mr. Hassett sought to set a high bar for the sort of deal that the administration would be willing to accept.“After decades and decades of mistreating American workers, it’s going to be tough to get him to decide to really come to the table and sign on the dotted line,” he said of the president.Tony Romm contributed to this report.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhat is a bear market?President Trump’s global tariffs have sent stock markets worldwide into a tailspin, and the S\u0026P 500 on Monday briefly entered bear market territory for the first time since 2022.Mr. Trump has seemed unmoved by the decline. He signaled on Monday that he had no plans to back off on tariffs, insisting that they would bring in “billions of dollars” in revenue and that other countries had been “abusing” the United States with their trade policies.Here is what to know about a bear market.What is a bear market?A bear market is a Wall Street term for a sustained market downturn, when a stock index closes 20 percent from its last peak.The 20 percent threshold signals investor pessimism about the future of the economy.Are we in a bear market now?The S\u0026P 500, the benchmark U.S. stock index, opened lower on Monday. The index was already down 17.4 percent from its last high, on Feb. 19, and if it closes Monday’s trading with a loss of at least 3.1 percent, that would tip it into a bear market. Loading market data... Source: FactSet Analysts at Morgan Stanley have warned that an even steeper drop is possible. Goldman Sachs on Monday slashed its forecast for economic growth, citing a growing risk of a U.S. recession next year.The Nasdaq Composite Index, as well as the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies that are more vulnerable to the economic outlook, are already in a bear market.This sounds ominous. What should I do with my money?A market decline can offer opportunities for investors with long horizons. Investing in diversified, low-cost index funds has been a successful strategy over the years, through bull markets and bears.But given the deepening concern that Mr. Trump’s trade agenda could set off a severe economic downturn, volatility and uncertainty are high. People with shorter investment timelines, as well as those nearing retirement, often shift more assets into bonds, which have historically shown greater resilience during downturns.When was the last bear market, and how long does one last?The U.S. stock market has always recovered from declines, usually within a couple of years. In early 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus set off global shutdowns, causing a short, sharp bear market. The Federal Reserve intervened, and markets regained their losses in six months. In late 2021, fears of surging inflation leading to sharply higher interest rates pulled the S\u0026P into a bear market in early 2022, which lasted for much of the year.The S\u0026P has entered a bear market 15 times since 1929. Bear markets have lasted 18.9 months on average, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S\u0026P Dow Jones Indices.How do bear markets affect the economy?ImageThe sculptures of a bull and a bear in Frankfurt. The bear and bull symbolize how the stock market is trending.Credit...Felix Schmitt for The New York TimesBear markets are sometimes precursors to recessions, but not always.Recessions, defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,” are much more perilous for the economy. Recessions often lead to job losses as economies contract, such as in the summer of 2020, when unemployment levels rose to their worst levels since the Great Depression.Where did these names — bulls and bears — originate?The exact origins of the phrase are unclear. But they came into mainstream vernacular in London in the 18th century. One theory traces “bear” to the proverb “selling the bear skin before you’ve caught the bear,” according to Merriam Webster. The poet Alexander Pope and other writers helped popularize the use of the words bull or bear to describe the stock market when writing about the frenzied rally of the South Sea Company stock and its infamous plummet in a financial scandal referred to as the South Sea bubble.What will happen next?Mr. Trump on Monday repeated his calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. But the Fed does not seem in a hurry to intervene.Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said on Friday that the central bank needed to assess the economic effects of the tariffs before taking action, and he has warned that cutting rates could fan inflation.A new wave of Trump tariffs that are set to take effect this week could lead to even more turmoil in the markets. When asked by reporters on Sunday about the market turmoil and fears of a recession, Mr. Trump said that “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”Jamie Dimon warns tariffs could increase inflation and weigh on growth.ImageJamie Dimon, chief of JPMorgan Chase, said U.S. tariffs would fuel inflation and slow the economy.Credit...Haiyun Jiang for The New York TimesPresident Trump’s wave of tariffs threatens to bring both short-term economic pain, including lower growth, and long-term damage to America’s standing and trade relationships around the world, the chief executive of Wall Street’s biggest bank warned on Monday.“The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession,” Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, wrote in his annual letter to shareholders.The warning by Mr. Dimon, one of Wall Street’s most influential leaders, echoes the growing anxiety among corporate chiefs about how the tariffs will play out. Even those who had initially professed support for Mr. Trump’s trade plans are becoming increasingly worried about the consequences.Even before Mr. Trump’s tariff announcement last week, the U.S. economy had been showing signs of strain after years of healthy performance, Mr. Dimon wrote. Inflation was already a worry, he said, pointing to a yawning fiscal deficit and the need for more infrastructure spending. And stock valuations remain well above historical averages, even after the recent market sell-off.The potential consequences of the trade fight could make things worse, the letter said. Those include other countries’ efforts to fight back — as China has done by imposing 34 percent counterlevies — and a possible erosion of confidence among consumers and investors. Mr. Dimon also warned about the weakening of the American dollar’s role as the global reserve currency.“If America, for whatever reason, becomes a less attractive investment destination, the U.S. dollar and the economy could suffer if foreigners sold their U.S. assets,” he wrote.JPMorgan’s own economists have increasingly been saying a recession is more likely this year, though Mr. Dimon did not personally take a position on those odds in his shareholder letter.While he asserted that JPMorgan itself was strong enough to withstand the shocks that the levies posed — its traders have profited from previous whipsaws in the markets — the global economy may not be so fortunate. “It is not particularly good for the capital markets,” Mr. Dimon wrote of the tariff-linked volatility.For now, Mr. Dimon wrote, he is hoping for a speedy resolution to the trade battles. “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better, because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,” he wrote.The longer-term worry, Mr. Dimon said, is that Mr. Trump’s fight could shred decades-old alliances that cemented the United States’ primacy in the global order. The JPMorgan chief wrote that he was worried that America’s trading partners might seek out deals with the likes of China, Iran or Russia in response to the tariffs.“America First is fine,” Mr. Dimon wrote, referring to Mr. Trump’s description of his policies, “as long as it doesn’t end up being America alone.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBritain eases rules on electric vehicles as auto tariffs hit.ImageLand Rovers and other cars at the port of Southampton. The automaker Jaguar Land Rover said it would pause shipments to the United States this month.Credit...Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesThe British government eased rules on carmakers requiring them to shift toward selling electric vehicles, as officials sought to blunt some of the pain caused by new auto tariffs on foreign cars sold in the United States.British officials said on Sunday that they would keep the requirement to stop the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars by 2030, but gave carmakers more flexibility to meet annual targets on electric vehicle sales between now and the 2030 deadline, so they could sell more cars in later years when demand is expected to be higher and face lower penalties. Officials also said that hybrid cars could be sold until 2035.Last month, President Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on imported cars and auto parts, upending the complex supply chains that underpin the global auto industry. The tariffs on cars imported into the United States came into effect last week and a levy on parts is set to begin next month.“Global trade is being transformed so we must go further and faster in reshaping our economy,” Keir Starmer, Britain’s prime minister, said in a statement.On Saturday, the British luxury automaker, Jaguar Land Rover, said that it was pausing shipments to the United States this month, as it assessed the altered trading conditions. The United States is the largest single-country export market for British cars, with 6.4 billion pounds’ ($8.3 billion) worth of vehicles shipped there in 2023. That’s about a tenth of Britain’s overall exports in goods to the United States.Even before the latest tariffs by the Trump administration, Britain’s car industry was struggling. Last year, car production dropped to its lowest level in seven decades.The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, an industry group, welcomed the government’s changes to the electric-vehicle mandate but said that more action was probably needed to increase consumer demand for these cars.“Industry remains committed to decarbonizing road transport,” Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the group, said in a statement. The targets in the electric vehicle mandate “are incredibly challenging, especially with a paucity of consumer demand and geopolitical upheaval,” he added.The government also exempted small-volume, high-end manufacturers, such as McLaren and Aston Martin, from the rules. And vans with an internal combustion engine will also be allowed to be sold until 2035, alongside hybrid vans.So far, the British government has resisted hitting back with retaliatory tariffs on goods it imports from the United States. The Trump administration imposed a “base line” 10 percent tariff on goods from Britain, but not additional “reciprocal” levies that apply to many other countries. Mr. Starmer has said that he remained “calm” and was working toward negotiating a trade deal with the United States, focused on technology.But the government was ready to intervene where needed to “shelter British business from the storm,” the prime minister wrote in The Sunday Telegraph.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT",

Even those who had initially professed support for Mr. Trump’s trade plans are becoming increasingly worried about the consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven before Mr. Trump’s tariff announcement last week, the U.S. economy had been showing signs of strain after years of healthy performance, Mr. Dimon wrote. Inflation was already a worry, he said, pointing to a yawning fiscal deficit and the need for more infrastructure spending. And stock valuations remain well above historical averages, even after the recent market sell-off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe potential consequences of the trade fight could make things worse, the letter said. Those include other countries’ efforts to fight back — as China has done by imposing 34 percent counterlevies — and a possible erosion of confidence among consumers and investors. Mr. Dimon also warned about the weakening of the American dollar’s role as the global reserve currency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“If America, for whatever reason, becomes a less attractive investment destination, the U.S. dollar and the economy could suffer if foreigners sold their U.S. assets,” he wrote.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJPMorgan’s own economists have increasingly been saying a recession is more likely this year, though Mr. Dimon did not personally take a position on those odds in his shareholder letter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile he asserted that JPMorgan itself was strong enough to withstand the shocks that the levies posed — its traders have profited from previous whipsaws in the markets — the global economy may not be so fortunate. “It is not particularly good for the capital markets,” Mr. Dimon wrote of the tariff-linked volatility.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor now, Mr. Dimon wrote, he is hoping for a speedy resolution to the trade battles. “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better, because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,” he wrote.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe longer-term worry, Mr. Dimon said, is that Mr. Trump’s fight could shred decades-old alliances that cemented the United States’ primacy in the global order.
