(OnSceneTV)Video from the scene obtained by KTLA shows dozens of vandals punching the slow-moving Metro train and spray painting it as it came to a halt.“Around midnight, approximately 50 trespassers blocked two A Line trains traveling northbound and southbound at the intersection of Washington Boulevard and Maple Street, south of downtown Los Angeles,” Metro said in a statement given to KTLA. “The trespassers began to spray paint on both trains and gained entry into the southbound train and sprayed paint on the interior of the train. During the incident, no operators or passengers were harmed and service was delayed around 20 minutes.”Several individuals were also seen vandalizing an LAPD squad car – even posing for pictures in front of it, shooting fireworks at it, kicking it and spray painting it as the officers started to drive away. Many of those who were not actively engaging in the vandalism were recording the chaos on their cell phones.Multiple area businesses also had graffiti scrawled on them, including a Panda Express, a WaBa Grill, a dialysis clinic and a medical building, among others.Chaos unfolds in downtown Los Angeles as large mob vandalizes train, police car, businesses.
