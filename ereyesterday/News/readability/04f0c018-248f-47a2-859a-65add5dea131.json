  "text": "File photo: Canadian MP Chandra Arya (Picture credit: ANI)The Indian-origin Canadian MP Chandra Arya, who represents Nepean, announced on Sunday that he had been barred from running in the Liberal Party's leadership contest.In a statement posted on social media, Arya revealed he was informed of the party's decision on Saturday and is awaiting official communication.“Today, I was informed by the Liberal Party of Canada that I will not be permitted to enter the leadership race,” Arya wrote. He expressed gratitude to volunteers who supported his campaign and raised concerns about the decision's impact on the legitimacy of the leadership race and the next prime minister.According to CBC News, Liberal Party spokesperson Parker Lund confirmed Arya’s disqualification, citing Section 4(c)iii of the party’s national leadership rules. The section allows a panel of party officials to disqualify candidates who fail to meet \"mandatory criteria\" or are deemed “manifestly unfit for the office of Leader of the Party.” Reasons may include public statements, reputational risks, or improper conduct.Arya's campaign and controversiesArya, the first sitting MP to launch a leadership campaign, vowed to eliminate the monarchy if elected and stated that his lack of French language skills would not affect his appeal to French-speaking Canadians. He also diverged from the Liberal government on some issues, such as sponsoring a petition in 2023 against a foreign agent registry—though he later expressed support for it.Arya’s ties to India have also drawn scrutiny amid strained Canada-India relations. In 2023, he met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a personal trip, a move criticised for its timing and lack of alignment with Canadian foreign policy.Arya’s disqualification has sparked debate about the transparency of the leadership race. “This decision raises significant questions about the legitimacy of the leadership race and, by extension, the legitimacy of the next Prime Minister of Canada,” Arya wrote in his statement.“While I await their official communication, I am carefully considering my next steps,” Arya added.According to CTV News, Arya had previously submitted his nomination package before the deadline and met the initial financial requirements. The party has yet to provide a detailed explanation for his disqualification.Arya’s exit leaves six confirmed contenders in the race, including former Canadian finance minister Chrystia Freeland, former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney and Nova Scotia MP Jaime Battiste. The party is expected to announce the official candidates following final reviews by the party and Elections Canada, with a winner to be declared on March 9.",
