  "text": "The body of a missing rabbi, Zvi Kogan, has been found in the United Arab Emirates, Israel said Sunday, calling his death a “heinous act of antisemitic terrorism” and promising to use “all available means” to bring the perpetrators to justice.Kogan, an Israeli-Moldovan citizen, had been missing since Thursday. He served as the emissary for the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, a branch of Orthodox Judaism, in the UAE.Live coverage contributors 9Body of rabbi found in the UAE; three arrestedReturn to menuAn Israeli-Moldovan rabbi based in the United Arab Emirates was abducted and killed in what Israeli officials called an “abhorrent antisemitic terrorist attack,” authorities said Sunday, and Emirati officials said they had arrested three men in connection with his death.Rabbi Zvi Kogan, 28, was an emissary of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, a branch of Orthodox Judaism, according to the Israeli government. Kogan, based in Abu Dhabi, was “abducted in Dubai on Thursday afternoon,” Chabad said.In remarks to his cabinet on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Kogan’s death an “antisemitic terrorist attack” and said Israel will “use all means, and will deal with these murderers, and those who dispatched them, to the fullest extent of the law.”The rabbi’s body was located by local intelligence officials and security forces in the UAE, the statement said. It did not provide further details about his death.A separate statement issued by Israel’s National Security Council said Kogan was killed Thursday by “terrorist elements,” reiterating guidance advising Israeli nationals to avoid nonessential travel to the UAE. Israelis already in the country should take precautions, it said, including maintaining “heightened alertness in public places” and avoiding visiting areas “associated with the Israeli and Jewish populations.”The UAE’s ministry of the interior, which referred to Kogan as a Moldovan citizen, said Sunday that local authorities arrested three people in connection with the killing. It said that it would provide more details “upon the conclusion of the investigations.”In a post on X, the ministry said that authorities began searching for Kogan as soon as he was reported missing and that the UAE is “fully committed to safeguarding the safety and security of its citizens, residents and visitors.”The embassy of the UAE in the United States on Sunday called Kogan’s death “senseless.”“Zvi Kogan’s murder was more than a crime in the UAE,” the embassy said in a post on X. “It was a crime against the UAE. It was an attack on our homeland, on our values and on our vision.”The UAE normalized relations with Israel in 2020 as part of the Trump administration’s Abraham Accords, which brokered ties between Israel and four Arab states. That September, the Chabad-Lubavitch movement announced the appointment of an official emissary to the UAE. Kogan is listed as one of five rabbis on Chabad’s website for the UAE.In violent weekend, top E.U. diplomat pours cold water on Lebanon cease-fireReturn to menuBEIRUT — In a weekend of heavy violence between Israel and Hezbollah, Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, used his final meeting in office Sunday to dampen any hopes of an imminent cease-fire in Lebanon, pointing to a lack of Israeli appetite.“I am not convinced it is going to happen,” Borrell said in a press briefing Sunday evening after a day of meeting with Lebanese officials. “I do not see the Israeli government interested clearly in reaching an agreement for a cease-fire.”Talks of bringing an end to the war ramped up over the past week after Hezbollah and the Lebanese government agreed to a U.S.-proposed cease-fire agreement, but with some comments. In Beirut on Tuesday, U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein said the gaps between the warring sides were narrowing and a cease-fire was within grasp, before traveling to Israel to continue negotiations.Then on Saturday, the biggest Israeli airstrike to hit central Beirut came crashing down at 4 a.m., killing at least 29 people and injuring 67 others. More than 250 projectiles were launched into Israeli territory on Sunday, according to its military — the heaviest bombardment in two months — as Hezbollah sent its response.On the streets in Beirut there was a common conviction that Lebanese civilians were again trapped in the middle of negotiations through violence as they awaited the blowback from Israel.Earlier Sunday, at a news conference after meeting Lebanese officials, Borrell called for more pressure on Israel and Hezbollah to reach a deal and said the U.S. proposal was awaiting final approval from Israel.But in his swan-song remarks at a closed press briefing before he left Beirut, he was not optimistic that a deal would get over the line anytime soon. He referenced the fact that Israel assassinated Hasan Nasrallah after the former Hezbollah chief had agreed to a deal. Borrell also referred to remarks from members of the Israeli government that nod to a desire for territorial expansion.“I’ve heard so many times that a cease-fire is coming. … It seems once again Israel is putting new conditions,” he said. He referred to Israel declining to allow France to be part of an international monitoring mechanism in southern Lebanon as one example of an eleventh-hour change.“It seems there is not a strong appetite for it,” he concluded.Fighting in Lebanon intensifies around Israel’s deepest known advancesReturn to menuBEIRUT — The pace of Israel’s ground invasion in southern Lebanon accelerated over the weekend, with fighting taking place around some of Israel’s deepest known advances.Khiam, a strategic location about four miles from the Israeli border in Lebanon’s southeast, witnessed “one of the most difficult and violent nights since the start of the ground invasion,” Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported Sunday.The NNA said Israel shelled several neighborhoods with artillery, booby-trapped homes and shops, and “blew up an entire neighborhood on the western side of the town.” In previous reports over the weekend, the NNA said Israel was trying to control the town because it is “a strategic gateway for a rapid ground incursion.”Hezbollah has been reporting attacks on Israeli troops and tanks on Khiam’s outskirts for the past three weeks, including about 20 attacks to the town’s east and south since Friday. But the latest push comes as Lebanese media report that Israel is simultaneously moving farther north in Lebanon’s south and southwest.In nearby Deir Mimas, Mayor George Nakad told The Washington Post on Sunday that Israeli troops entered the area three days ago from the border village of Kfarkela. The municipality is trying to arrange for a pregnant woman to be evacuated, but Israel has so far denied permission for the Red Cross to move in, he said. From here, Nakad said, Israeli forces would be able to advance in the direction of the Bekaa Valley.In southwest Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces and Hezbollah are locked in ground fighting in the surroundings of a crusader castle in the town of Chamaa, in one of the deepest advances yet. Four U.N. peacekeepers were injured Friday as their base was caught in the crosshairs for the third time.Closer to the coast, fighting has picked up around a strategic hill in Bayada — which sits beside the seaside road to the southern city of Tyre — where Lebanese media and Hezbollah say the IDF is advancing. Hezbollah said Sunday that it launched two attacks on IDF bases outside Tel Aviv. There was no immediate comment on the claim from the IDF.Separately, the Lebanese army said Sunday that one soldier was killed and 18 others were injured, some seriously, in an Israeli strike on an army base in Amriyeh, in southern Lebanon. The IDF said a Lebanese army post was hit during “active combat operations” against Hezbollah, resulting in soldiers’ injuries, and expressed “regret” for the incident.Director of northern Gaza’s Kamal Adwan Hospital wounded, official saysReturn to menuHussam Abu Safiya, the director of northern Gaza’s Kamal Adwan Hospital, was injured in an attack on the facility Saturday, Munir al-Bursh, director general of Gaza’s Health Ministry, told The Washington Post in a text message Sunday.“We will continue to provide our service…. even if it costs us our lives,” Abu Safiya said from a hospital bed in a video which began to circulate on social media Saturday. Twelve other health care workers at his hospital were injured the previous day, he added.The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement Sunday it was “not aware of a strike in the area of the Kamal Adwan Hospital,” adding that it was fighting militants “while making efforts to avoid causing any harm to civilians.” The IDF said Friday the hospital’s area was an “active war zone.”The hospital is one of the last functioning medical facilities in northern Gaza. Earlier, Abu Safiya said it was attacked seven times in one day and has 86 patients, including 13 children. Israel has accused Hamas of using hospitals as operational bases, a claim that medics have rebutted.Israel ramped up its military assault on northern Gaza in early October, saying the goal is to keep Hamas from regrouping there.But aid agencies say that the renewed offensive is pushing the area to the edge of humanitarian collapse. “For almost 50 days, access to besieged areas of north Gaza has either been denied or impeded. People have no access to food or water,” Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for the U.N. agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) said in a statement Saturday.Gaza’s Civil Defense agency said Sunday that Israeli attacks since the start of the war have destroyed firefighting, rescue and ambulance equipment worth a total of $1.3 million.War fatigue deepens in Israel as deaths mount and fighting expands Return to menuTEL AVIV — Ari Krauss, a reservist in the Israeli military’s elite Golani Brigade, said he spent his days inside Gaza exploding underground tunnels. At night, he recalled, he would join the other fathers in uniform on a sandy hill, trying to get enough cellphone bars to FaceTime his infant daughter.His day job seemed like a distant memory. Early in the war, the brigade sent a letter to his company apologizing for drafting him but committing to no date for his full return. Being a soldier, the letter made clear, was now his main calling.“Once upon a time, I had my high-tech career and my family life, and I had to strike the balance,” said Krauss, who spent four months battling Hamas militants in Gaza and is preparing to return next month. “Now I have to enter into that equation the fact that I am disappearing for weeks, or months, on end.”Krauss’s dilemma, or some version of it, is shared by some 80,000 Israeli reservists who are planning to leave, or have already left, families, jobs and studies to serve on the front lines of Israel’s grinding wars in Gaza and Lebanon. Increasingly, some are choosing not to report for duty, putting further strain on an overextended military amid an ever-widening regional war.This is an excerpt from a full story.Israel prepares Lebanon cease-fire plan as ‘gift’ to Trump, officials sayA timeline of conflict on the Israel-Lebanon border Israeli military deaths in Lebanon raise questions over war’s scope",
