  "text": "JAFFA, Israel — Scores of Palestinians were killed and wounded trying to reach a food distribution site in southern Gaza on Sunday, according to residents, medics and the local health ministry.At least 31 people were killed and another 170 wounded, most of them with gunshot wounds to the extremities and upper body, according to local health officials and medics who treated the victims.While three witnesses said the gunfire came from Israeli military positions, the Israel Defense Forces denied the allegations, saying in a statement that an initial inquiry indicated that its soldiers did not fire at civilians while they were near or within the distribution site.An Israeli military official later said that troops had “acted to prevent several suspects from approaching” them overnight and fired warning shots at the group, but that there was “no connection between this incident and the false claims made against the IDF.”The Washington Post interviewed three eyewitnesses to the shootings, as well three doctors who attended to the casualties and family members of the wounded. One witness, 43-year-old Mohammed al-Gharib, a local journalist, said he was a little over 100 yards from the gunfire when it erupted early Sunday. He said that it came from Israeli forces in the area and that he witnessed a quadcopter flying overhead before he escaped.At field hospitals in southern Gaza, doctors said they awoke shortly before 5 a.m. local time to the wail of ambulances, bringing bodies for burial and casualties for triage. Some of the dead still held the plastic sacks they had been carrying to gather food in.Israel has blocked almost all deliveries of food, water and humanitarian aid to Gaza since March 2, pushing parts of the enclave to the verge of famine. In the week since the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) began daily aid distributions in central and southern Gaza, large crowds have gathered nearby in the hope of securing what they can for their families.The GHF on Sunday described all reports of gunfire in the vicinity of its distribution sites as “completely false.”Khaled Shurrab, 33, said he arrived to wait on Rafah’s beach at 2 a.m.; his brother Mahmoud, who has a cardiac illness, had slept there overnight, bringing his wheelchair because he feared that he would struggle to carry the box of aid in his arms.The shooting began at about 4 a.m. local time, Shurrab said, and came from Israeli military positions near al-Alam Square, a roundabout along Gaza’s coastal road. Shurrab found his brother bleeding from the abdomen in the sand. “I saw so many injured people while I was rescuing him,” he said.Ahmed al-Faraa, a doctor at Nasser Hospital in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis, said that it had received 20 bodies from the attack and that 43 people were being treated for injuries, three of them in intensive care. The dead, he said, had gunshot wounds to the head and chest. The medical charity Doctors Without Borders said they had been “massacred.”The casualties “had visible gunshot wounds in their limbs, and their clothes were soaked with blood,” said Nour Alsaqa, a communications officer for the group. “They looked shattered and distraught after trying to secure food for their children, returning instead injured and empty-handed.”Victims continued to arrive at Nasser Hospital through the afternoon, said Victoria Rose, a British surgeon volunteering at the facility. While her team usually treats victims with lower-body blast wounds from Israeli bombing raids, the majority of Sunday’s casualties presented with gunshot wounds to the upper body.“We haven’t had a restock in any of our supplies since the second of March,” she said.The hospital has run out of much of the equipment needed to treat the casualties. “With the blood banks almost empty, medical staff themselves have had to donate blood,” Doctors Without Borders said.The privately run Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which began its aid distributions Tuesday, has faced mounting criticism over the design of its distribution system. It operates in just a handful of locations and requires Palestinians to travel long distances on foot to access the deliveries. Many families are unable to reach it. Others stay away, fearing violence.The United Nations and other major humanitarian actors refused to cooperate with the GHF before it launched operations, saying it was a dangerous way for Palestinians to receive aid and accusing the GHF of militarizing and weaponizing aid deliveries.“Today’s events have shown once again that this new system of aid delivery is dehumanising, dangerous and severely ineffective,” Claire Manera, emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, said in a statement. “Humanitarian aid must be provided only by humanitarian organisations who have the competence and determination to do it safely and effectively.”Every major humanitarian group working in Gaza has been sounding alarm bells over the hunger crisis there for more than a year.“Mothers are actually counting lentils to put into soup, in the hopes of being able to feed everybody. That’s how dire this is,” U.N. World Food Program Executive Director Cindy McCain said Sunday.“We need all crossings opened up, we need to be able to get in at scale, we need to be able to make sure that our aid delivery people are safe,” she added. “People are desperate, they are hungry, they need food.”Since GHF launched operations Tuesday, there have been daily reports of Palestinians coming under Israeli fire as crowds surge toward distribution sites. The IDF said that in one incident Tuesday, it fired warning shots to disperse crowds. But the International Committee of the Red Cross said its field hospital in Rafah had received a mass casualty influx, with everyone — including women and children — suffering from gunshot wounds.The Gaza Health Ministry said Israeli forces have killed at least 49 people heading toward the GHF’s four functioning distribution points over the past week. The Post has interviewed five eyewitnesses in recent days who reported gunfire coming from the direction of Israeli forces in the lead-up to GHF sites. The IDF did not respond to a request for comment on the multiple incidents.The GHF on Sunday released security footage of its distribution center in Rafah, seeking to show that no incident had occurred.But the mass casualty incident Sunday was not reported to have been at the aid distribution site itself. The troops opened fire on the al-Alam roundabout, according to an eyewitness interviewed by The Post and local reports — approximately a half-mile away from the distribution site — after the Israeli military ordered people to disperse from the aid site and return later.Videos The Post was unable to immediately verify showed bloodied bodies being transferred to hospitals by donkey-pulled wooden carts. In satellite imagery from Thursday, viewed by The Post, there appears to be an IDF outpost less than a mile away from al-Alam.American contractors inside the aid distribution site are aware of near-constant gunfire and kinetic action outside its confines, but they had no visibility or awareness of the events reported Sunday morning, according to one person with knowledge of the day’s aid distribution who spoke on the condition of anonymity to frankly discuss the conflicting accounts of what happened.The Israeli military does not inform the contractors of its positions or movements outside, the person said, but there has been no gunfire or violence inside the perimeter of operations.The Israeli military published a video late Sunday that appeared to show a gunman shooting someone as people around him scrambled to carry away what appeared to be humanitarian aid. The army said it was drone footage from Khan Younis that showed “armed and masked individuals hurling rocks and firing at Gazan civilians attempting to collect looted humanitarian aid.” But the details of what exactly was happening remained unclear. The shooting took place in broad daylight and appeared unrelated to the incidents around GHF distribution sites.Tamer Qishta, a local freelance journalist, told The Post he was at a clinic in the Rafah area when the shooting there began around 5 a.m. “The gunfire was very heavy because the number of people was enormous,” he said.In a separate incident Sunday morning, gunfire near an aid distribution point close to the Netzarim Corridor separating northern and southern Gaza killed one person and injured 24 others, said Marwan Abu Nasser, the acting administrative director of al-Awda Hospital in central Gaza’s Nuseirat. The Netzarim distribution point did not appear to be open Sunday, but people expectantly gathered there nonetheless, according to local reports.The IDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the alleged Netzarim-area shooting.Mandy Blackman, UK-Med’s field hospital leader in Mawasi, said Sunday that she has been treating casualties from the new aid distribution mechanism “almost daily” since it began work last week. The shooting incidents, she said, have tipped the already stretched hospital over capacity.Cheeseman reported from Beirut, Loveluck from Jerusalem and Balousha from Hamilton, Ontario.",
