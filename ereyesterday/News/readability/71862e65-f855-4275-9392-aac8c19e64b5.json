  "text": "As communities across Los Angeles County burned Wednesday in a spate of wildfires, the crisis highlighted the stark difference between the incoming and outgoing presidents and their relationships with California.President Biden stood next to Gov. Gavin Newsom, a fellow Democrat, at a fire station in Santa Monica and pledged to provide full federal support to the state.\"We’re prepared to do anything and everything for as long as it takes to contain these fires,\" Biden said.Read more: Live coverage: 2 dead and more than 1,000 homes, businesses, other buildings destroyed in L.A. County firesHours earlier, Republican President-elect Donald Trump, just days away from being sworn in on Jan. 20, blamed “Newscum and his Los Angeles crew” for the unfolding calamity.In a post on his social media site, Truth Social, Trump said the Democratic governor “refused to sign a water restoration declaration,\" which he alleged would have allowed millions of gallons of rain and snowmelt to flow south to the areas on fire.“Now the ultimate price is being paid,” Trump wrote. “I will demand that this incompetent governor allow beautiful, clean, fresh water to FLOW INTO CALIFORNIA!”The morning missive from the president-elect, as communities burned and thousands of people fled their homes, echoed his prior threats to withhold wildfire funding if Newsom declined to go along with Trump's water policy for California. Water experts have said, however, that Trump's water proposals probably will encounter substantial obstacles, and that his claims attempting to link water deliveries to the firefighting response were inaccurate.Read more: At least 5 dead in L.A. County firestorms; more than 1,000 structures lostThough Newsom praised Trump during his first term for approving federal disaster funding for wildfires, the governor has since said he had to “kiss the ring” to convince Trump to help.Newsom has commended Biden for not playing political games during disasters.\"It's impossible for me to express the level of appreciation and cooperation we've received from the White House and this administration,\" Newsom said in Santa Monica on Wednesday.Presidents have wide discretion when it comes to disaster aid, which could be in jeopardy in the future if Trump follows through with his threats after his inauguration.California and other states receive most federal wildfire aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, including direct payments and services to homeowners and renters whose properties were damaged, and public assistance for things such as search-and-rescue teams, debris removal and infrastructure repair.States need to show that an incident is of such a severity and magnitude that a response is beyond the state’s capability in order to qualify. The governor must request, and the president must declare, a major disaster and then approve any aid the governor requests.FEMA decides whether a federal disaster declaration is warranted and issues a recommendation to the president. In the past, presidents have followed that recommendation, but there’s nothing in the law that requires them to do so.Read more: Could Trump really cut off wildfire aid for California? AbsolutelyTrump initially refused to approve federal aid to California for wildfires in 2018 until a National Security Council staffer showed him that Orange County had a dense concentration of voters who supported him, according to Politico.In another example, in 2020, FEMA rejected a request to provide aid to California for a half-dozen wildfires and then reversed course the next day after Republicans made appeals to Trump and the governor and president spoke over the phone. State Sen. Ben Allen, a Democrat who lives and grew up in Santa Monica, attended Wednesday's briefing with the president and governor. Allen said it was obvious from Newsom’s remarks since the fires began that the governor was worried about federal support for disasters under the Trump administration. Allen said Biden’s response was remarkably quick and thorough. But he said he couldn’t imagine that Trump would ignore Californians in any time of need.“I have every expectation that the new administration will assist fellow Americans in moments of vulnerability,” Allen said. “That's what every White House has done, whether Democrat or Republican, throughout history. There's no reason why they shouldn’t continue to provide the same level of assistance and service that previous presidents have.”Despite Trump's feisty rhetoric, he did travel to California as president to survey fire damage and meet with Newsom. Trump toured Paradise in 2018 in the aftermath of the state's deadliest wildfire. And he met with Newsom in Sacramento after a spate of wildfires in 2020.Newsom and Trump traded blows on social media, in the news media and in the courts during the president-elect’s first term, but remained cordial in texts, calls and even in person. But that relationship appears to have soured during Biden’s presidency.Newsom has said Trump did not return a call he made in November to congratulate the incoming president on winning the election. An aide to Newsom said the two men have still not spoken.The president-elect continued to blame Newsom on Truth Social for the blazes on Wednesday: \"As of this moment, Gavin Newscum and his Los Angeles crew have contained exactly ZERO percent of the fire. It is burning at levels that even surpass last night. This is not government.\"Trump also took shots at Biden.\"NO WATER IN THE FIRE HYDRANTS, NO MONEY IN FEMA,\" he posted. \"THIS IS WHAT JOE BIDEN IS LEAVING ME. THANKS JOE!\"Peter Gleick, a hydroclimatologist and senior fellow of the Oakland-based Pacific Institute, said Trump's comments attempting to link California water policy with the water-supply problems facing firefighters in Southern California were \"blatantly false, irresponsible and politically self-serving.\"\"There is no water shortage in Southern California — the state's reservoirs are all at, or above, levels normally expected for this time of year. The problem with water supply for the fires is entirely the result of the massive immediate demands for firefighting water, broken or damaged pipes and pumps, and homeowners leaving hoses and sprinklers running in hopes of saving property.\"Staff writer Ian James contributed to this report.Sign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.
