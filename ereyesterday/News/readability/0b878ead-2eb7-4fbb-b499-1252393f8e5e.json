  "text": "BEIRUT — About 90 trucks carrying flour, baby food and nutritional supplements entered the Gaza Strip late Wednesday, local officials and the U.N. humanitarian affairs agency said, the first tranche of aid to reach the besieged territory in more than two months.The trucks finally departed the Kerem Shalom crossing after a days-long delay, which the United Nations said was the result of insecurity along the single route Israel had approved for distribution.“Israeli authorities had only allowed our teams to go through one area that was highly congested, that we felt was insecure and where we felt looting was highly likely to take place,” U.N. spokesman Stéphane Dujarric told reporters at a briefing Wednesday afternoon.He said discussions with Israeli officials to find alternative routes inside Gaza were ongoing. “We have brought in empty trucks from various places in Gaza to pick up the supplies,” Dujarric said. “Some of those trucks have already been loaded. They are ready to go.”Videos of what appeared to be loaded trucks driving in the dark along a main road in southern Gaza began circulating online. According to the deputy head of Gaza’s local transport union, Jihad Isleem, two of the trucks were intercepted by looters. And in one video, a group of men are shown tearing into bags of flour.After an 11-week blockade of the territory, Israel announced abruptly Sunday that it would allow a minimal amount of food into Gaza, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu describing the move as one he was forced to make to placate allies that are worried about mass starvation. Hunger experts have said that Gaza, home to more than 2 million people, is at risk of famine.“We eat anything to survive,” said Om Yousif, 46, a mother of five from Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. She said she hadn’t eaten bread in a week. “We used to depend on aid, but now there is none,” she said. “What do we do? Where do we go? Who do we ask for help from?”Initially, Israeli authorities told aid agencies that for five days, starting Monday and ending Friday, they would allow 100 trucks a day to move through the Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Gaza. Relief workers say that the population needs at least 500 trucks per day.According to COGAT, the arm of Israel’s Defense Ministry that coordinates aid in Gaza, the vehicles that entered late Wednesday were carrying flour, baby food and some medical supplies.In recent days, Israel has come under growing pressure from some of its closest allies to alleviate the human suffering in Gaza and roll back a renewed military offensive that Netanyahu said will include taking control of the enclave. Britain on Tuesday suspended free-trade negotiations with Israel, calling Netanyahu’s policies “egregious,” while the European Union said it was reviewing commercial ties.Tensions with allies spiked again Wednesday after the Israeli military fired warning shots at a delegation of diplomats visiting the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. The delegation included representatives from more than 20 countries, as well as the United Nations.Canada, France, Italy and Spain all confirmed that their diplomats were among those present when the military opened fire. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said the delegation had “deviated” from an approved route, prompting troops to fire warning shots to keep them at bay.Canada’s foreign affairs minister, Anita Anand, said Wednesday that four Canadian personnel were part of the delegation and that she had summoned the Israeli ambassador “to convey Canada’s serious concerns.”“We expect a full investigation and accountability,” Anand wrote on X.In Gaza, aid group Doctors Without Borders accused Israel of using a “ridiculously inadequate amount of aid” as “a smokescreen to pretend the siege is over.”For Wissam, a father of six, it’s a struggle to find enough food to feed his family each day. They each have some lentils, but are without bread, because what flour remains is prohibitively expensive.“I hope that it comes soon,” he said, referring to the aid being held at the border. “We need it to survive.”Berger reported from Jaffa, Israel, and Soroka from Tel Aviv.
